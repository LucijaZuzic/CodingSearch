In this paper, multi-target tracking and data fusion techniques are applied to live-recorded data from a network of three oceanographic HFSW radars installed on the coast of the German Bight, in the North Sea. This campaign follows a previous one conducted in 2009, in which two HFSW radars were deployed on the coast of the Ligurian Sea, in the Mediterranean. Ship reports from the automatic identification system, recorded from a number of coastal stations, are exploited as ground truth information. A methodology is then applied to classify the fused tracks and to estimate single-sensor and data fusion performances. Both in situ and model data are used to investigate the capabilities of the systems according to the variations of the meteorological and oceanographic conditions.

One of the challenges is increasing dependency on reliable network connectivity that can range from low priority entertainment communications to high priority safety critical communications. Traffic prioritization is needed at the open sea, where ships typically resort to expensive satellite connectivity that incurs long latency and narrow bandwidth. Near the coastline, ships can switch to 5G-based communications with low latency and high bandwidth, and possibly even utilize low-latency edge computing capabilities. Our contribution in this paper is a cloud-based networking testbed that supports network traffic shaping to emulate satellite and 5G-based communications between an edge cloud located onboard a ship and another edge cloud located onboard another ship or at the shore under traffic loss scenarios. Potential use-cases for our work include emulation of peer-to-peer communications (i.e., ship-to-ship or ship-to-shore) and mesh networking. The system can also be used as a basis for real-time ship networking, for instance, as building block for traffic prioritization in Kubernetes-based edge clouds.","","978-1-6654-9153-2","10.1109/WF-IoT54382.2022.10152152","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10152152","maritime;networking;5G;satellite;Kubernetes;edge cloud","Wireless communication;Cloud computing;Satellites;Bandwidth;Telecommunication traffic;Switches;Safety","5G mobile communication;cloud computing;edge computing;logistics;marine safety;ships;telecommunication computing;telecommunication traffic","autonomous maritime transport;cloud-based networking;emulated wireless edge cloud connectivity;expensive satellite connectivity;high priority safety critical communications;Kubernetes-based edge clouds;low priority entertainment communications;low-latency edge computing capabilities;maritime environments;maritime industry;narrow bandwidth;network traffic;open sea;peer-to-peer communications;real-time ship networking;reliable network connectivity;remote ship pilotage;ship-to-ship;ship-to-shore;smart fairway navigation;smart maritime logistics;traffic loss scenarios;traffic prioritization","","","","17","IEEE","22 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

VTSs (Vessel Traffic Systems) use several sources of information for estimating ships’ Position Navigation and Velocity, such as AIS (Automatic Identification System) and RADAR (RAdio Detection And Ranging); nevertheless, VTS areas do not cover the entire costal area of a country. In many cases the classification and identification of small non-AIS vessels could provide an important to the safety of navigation.Indeed, especially during the summer, the nautical tourism has a great impact on the maritime traffic congestion. The issue involves many institutions such as Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) and local maritime authorities which are not able to monitor the high volume of nautical traffic. This work introduces an optical system designed to monitor the traffic in small coastal areas based on images acquired by a single camera. The reliability and accuracy of the system is conditioned by the size of the pixel on the sea surface (Ground Sample Distance-GSD) and by the camera footprint area as well. More in detail, this work focuses on the detection of the best camera placement on the coast for optimizing the GSD size and obtaining the shape of camera footprint.

One of them is that various unwanted echo components constantly destroy the detection performance of HFSWR, especially the dynamically changing ionosphere clutter. This article proposes an adaptive ionosphere clutter suppression and target detection algorithm (AICSTD) based on improved higher order singular value decomposition (HOSVD) and deep learning network. First, we analyze the multiple-dimensional characteristics of different types of ionosphere clutter echo data. Then, refer to the multichannel HFSWR echo data structure, we apply simplified HOSVD and orthogonal subspace projection to eliminate the unwanted echo component and, meanwhile, preserve the target echo. The key parameter of simplified HOSVD is determined by the mean structural similarity (MSSIM) index, which contributes to reduce the computation complexity of the proposed method. Finally, we improved the deep learning network to detect the targets in various behaviors after the clutter suppression. In order to address the issue of limited clutter data, transfer learning based on historical radar echo data is applied. A thorough experimental analysis on various real clutter data shows that the proposed method performs competitively. Our method shows a superior performance over many state-of-the-art clutter suppression methods, with a covered target detection accuracy of 92.4% under strong spread clutter background.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2023.3313878","State Key Program of National Natural Science of China(grant numbers:62031014); Technology Foundation Project of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology(grant numbers:JSQB2020603A001); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10246393","Deep learning;higher order singular value decomposition (HOSVD);high-frequency surface wave radar (HFSWR);ionosphere clutter suppression;structural similarity (SSIM) index;target detection","Clutter;Ionosphere;Doppler effect;Tensors;Reflection;Object detection;Deep learning","","","","","","41","IEEE","11 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To address these problems, we proposed a noise feature disentanglement YOLO (NFD-YOLO) by combining noise-agnostic features learning and attention mechanism. Firstly, we rethink the speckle noise by treating it as the domain shift between the training dataset and real-measured SSS images and build a domain generalization-based (DG-based) underwater object detection framework. Then, we extend YOLOv5 with a feature manipulation module, a noise-agnostic subnetwork, and an auxiliary noise-biased subnetwork for noise features disentanglement, more biases toward noise-agnostic features and less reliance on noise-biased features in underwater object detection, respectively. Finally, the ACmix attention module is introduced for a more powerful learning capacity and attention to the object areas based on a small dataset. According to the experiment results, the proposed NFD-YOLO achieved 75.1% mean average precision (mAP) in the test domain, which increased by 7.5% than YOLOv5, and 75.7% ± 0.4% mAP and 77.5% ± 1.6% mAP for different speckle noise distributions and transfer directions, respectively, which verified its generalization ability and robustness for speckle noise.

Afterward, the proposed algorithm tracks all the objects using a new concept: each object is tracked with a respective filter bank consisting of three Adaptive Extended Kalman Filters (AEKF) as subfilters. These have the same prediction model but different correction algorithms based on various measurement sources. The covariance noise matrices are adapted based on the current measurement quality. The filter banks can overcome drawbacks such as wrong and incomplete measurements, thus improving tracking performance.We have validated the algorithm in real-world scenarios in Rostock Harbor, Germany. The proposed algorithm can track all the objects within the view simultaneously in real-time. By comparing with a reference vessel, the mean 2D position error is ca. 2 m, which is much smaller than the AIS-only solution (5 to 10 m).

The approach to conceptual design follows a methodology in which the airplane is conceived in a step-by-step, iterative fashion, making use of empirical data and numerical information. In preliminary design, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is employed in order to increase the level of accuracy and refine the design. Subsequently, the air frame design is performed through computed aided design (CAD) modelling, endorsed by a numerical stress analysis via a finite element analysis (FEA). As the project's output, a class I unmanned aircraft capable of not only meeting, but also surpassing the demanded mission requirements, is presented.","2575-7296","978-1-7281-0333-4","10.1109/ICUAS.2019.8798217","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8798217","","Aircraft;Fuels;Payloads;Automotive components;Surveillance;Aircraft propulsion","aerodynamics;air pollution measurement;aircraft;autonomous aerial vehicles;CAD;computational fluid dynamics;emergency management;finite element analysis;stress analysis","computed aided design modelling;air frame design;computational fluid dynamics;conceptual design;European Maritime Safety Agency's specifications;composite structural design;propulsion;atmospheric pollution monitoring;maritime surveillance;finite element analysis;numerical stress analysis;numerical information;empirical data;airplane;aerodynamics;search and rescue missions;class I unmanned aircraft","","","","15","IEEE","15 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The purpose of this study is to determine a strategic location as a center for maritime defense logistics distribution lines in order to secure the IKN area using the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) method combined with satellite image analysis using a Geographic Information System (GIS) by considering the criteria and sub-criteria in determining the location center for maritime defense logistics distribution lines. The results of the research from the AHP weighting method show that the priority order of criteria based on experts is safety from natural conditions, population conditions, environmental locations, distribution line conditions, and required cost. The results of remote sensing satellite image data processing with analysis using Geographic Information Systems with ArcGIS software shows that the results of satellite image overlays are equipped with regional boundaries and routes around IKN. The determination of the location of the center of the distribution line for the defense logistics of the marine sector is concentrated in Samboja District, surely in the Kampung Lama Village which is also used as the location point for the pier plan.

The port state control mechanism enables these authorities to physically verify suspect vessels (e.g., involved in smuggling or piracy events), but choosing the most relevant vessels to be inspected represents a challenging task. This decision can be enhanced by AI-powered systems that analyse large amounts of data, identify patterns and report all observed discrepancies. This paper presents a statistical analysis on the temporal durations of four types of naval statuses: sailing, docked in port, waiting at anchor and not transmitting AIS data. These durations were extracted from the historical activity of different classes of vessels that passed the Black Sea region (Romanian Exclusive Economic Zone) in 2022. Probability density functions were built for these vessels and all statuses' durations were fitted into known parametric distributions. Finally, the paper shows the results of multiple outlier detection algorithms that searched for anomalous data in a multivariate manner.","","979-8-3503-2138-8","10.1109/ECAI58194.2023.10193981","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10193981","outlier detection;port state control;maritime anomaly detection;unsupervised learning;AIS","Electric potential;Statistical analysis;Seaports;Probability density function;Safety;Security;Artificial intelligence","data handling;marine engineering;marine safety;probability;production engineering computing;public administration;sea ports;ships;statistical analysis","AI-powered systems;AIS data;anomalous data;anomalous maritime profiles;Black Sea region;historical activity;maritime authorities;naval statuses;observed discrepancies;outlier detection approach;port state control mechanism;probability density functions;Romanian exclusive economic zone;shipping lanes;smuggling;statistical analysis;suspect vessels;temporal durations","","","","17","IEEE","2 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The successful execution of such activities requires that operators have adequate Situational Awareness (SA), while avoiding situations of information overload, and the right amount of, or calibrated, Trust in the system. In this study, we examined how operator SA and Trust were affected by different levels of Immersion of the Human-Machine Interface (HMI). Simulated RCC interfaces were constructed for a scenario where an autonomous container ship traversed the arctic escorted by robotic aids. SA, Trust, and Motion Sickness (MS) were tracked over time. Different Virtual Reality (VR) technologies were used to represent three levels of Immersion: Non-Immersive VR (NVR), Semi-Immersive VR (SVR), and Immersive VR (IVR). The results illustrated various trade-offs – with NVR shown to be less taxing, SVR showing several potential benefits for SA, and IVR showing a strong relationship between Trust and SA accuracy, but increased MS. These results suggest that Immersion is an important factor in Situational Awareness and Trust in automation; future research should consider both the extent of Immersion, potential for MS, and the format of delivery (e.g. head-mounted displays versus immersive projection displays). Understanding these trade-offs between levels of Immersion is a requisite step for designing RCCs.","","979-8-3503-3226-1","10.1109/OCEANSLimerick52467.2023.10244249","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10244249","Maritime Autonomous Surface Ship (MASS);Remote Control Centre (RCC);Ice Navigation;Virtual Reality (VR);Situational Awareness (SA);Trust;Motion Sickness (MS)","Sea surface;Tracking;Navigation;Virtual reality;Motion sickness;Marine vehicles;Monitoring","helmet mounted displays;marine engineering;marine safety;ships;virtual reality","adequate Situational Awareness;autonomous container ship;autonomous shipping;Different Virtual Reality technologies;Human-Machine Interface;immersive projection displays;Immersive VR;International Maritime Organisation's roadmap;MS;Remote Control Centre;remotely monitored Maritime autonomous surface ships;simulated RCC interfaces","","","","31","IEEE","12 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Technologies such as direct RF digitization, AI resource management, and high bandwidth amplifiers could enable a future MFRFS to fulfil these functions. Multifunctionality must be a key design driver when procuring MFRFSs; however, this runs counter to the traditional approach of requiring an assured minimum performance of a single function—while a particular system based around an individual function could potentially outperform the MFRFS, the overall performance across all functions should be better than the performance of a collection of individual systems.","1557-959X","","10.1109/MAES.2021.3081168","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9656619","","Maritime communications;Radar tracking;Radar antennas;Target tracking;Missiles;Radio frequency;Radar cross-sections;Electronic warfare;Resource management;Artificial intelligence","electronic warfare;frequency response;marine radar","multifunction maritime radar;RF systems;MFR;extremely capable radio frequency front ends;multifunctional radar;multifunctional radio frequency system;wireless communications;electronic warfare;direct RF digitization;AI resource management;high bandwidth amplifiers;future MFRFS;key design driver","","","","28","IEEE","20 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

However, broadband, low-delay, and reliable wireless connectivity to the ever-increasing number of vessels, buoys, platforms and sensors in maritime communication networks (MCNs) has not yet been achieved. Towards this end, the integration of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in MCNs provides an aerial dimension to current deployments, relying on shore-based base stations (BSs) with limited coverage and satellite links with high latency. In this work, a maritime IoT topology is examined where direct uplink communication with a shore BS cannot be established due to excessive pathloss. In this context, we employ multiple UAVs for end-to-end connectivity, simultaneously receiving data from the maritime IoT nodes, following the non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) paradigm. In contrast to other UAV-aided NOMA schemes in maritime settings, dynamic decoding ordering at the UAVs is used to improve the performance of successive interference cancellation (SIC), considering the rate requirements and the channel state information (CSI) of each maritime node towards the UAVs. Moreover, the UAVs are equipped with buffers to store data and provide increased degrees of freedom in opportunistic UAV selection. Simulations reveal that the proposed opportunistic UAV-aided NOMA improves the average sum-rate of NOMAbased maritime IoT communication, leveraging the dynamic decoding ordering and caching capabilities of the UAVs.","","978-1-6654-7598-3","10.1109/DRCN57075.2023.10108290","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10108290","Maritime Communication Networks;Maritime Internet-of-Things;Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA);Opportunistic Selection;Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)","Wireless communication;NOMA;Wireless sensor networks;Interference cancellation;Autonomous aerial vehicles;Decoding;Internet of Things","5G mobile communication;autonomous aerial vehicles;cellular radio;decoding;interference suppression;Internet of Things;marine communication;multi-access systems;nonorthogonal multiple access;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication power management;wireless channels","aerial dimension;direct uplink communication;economic growth;emerging maritime Internet;end-to-end connectivity;maritime activities;maritime communication networks;maritime IoT topology;maritime node;maritime settings;MCNs;multiple UAVs;NOMAbased maritime IoT communication;nonorthogonal multiple access paradigm;ocean monitoring systems;opportunistic UAV selection;opportunistic UAV-aided NOMA;reliable wireless connectivity;shore-based base stations;smart ports;UAV-aided maritime Internet-of-Things;UAV-aided NOMA schemes;unmanned aerial vehicles;uplink NOMA","","","","30","IEEE","26 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, limited research has been conducted to apply THz technique in maritime communications as hostile sea conditions cause significant path loss, thus leading to unacceptable signal error rate. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive THz maritime communication system to tackle the above-mentioned challenge. Specifically, we design a joint source-channel coding scheme by using system random linear network coding (sRLNC) and Reed-Solomon (RS) to ensure transmission reliability. To further improve the transmission efficiency, we propose a novel triple-channel communication architecture facilitated by a very high frequency (VHF) feedback channel. With this design, the source data can be transmitted via the THz main channel while the coding redundancy is dispatched in the auxiliary channel. Meanwhile, the feedback channel allows sender to use an adaptive mechanism to achieve the transmission efficiency with higher transmission rate over long communication distance. In addition, we adopt the Doppler frequency offset in maritime environment to compensate both relative movement between communication parties and adversarial maritime factors, e.g., strong wind and extreme sea states. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed THz system has remarkable capability not only to improve the communication efficiency up to 20Gbps compared to those conventional high frequency (HF), VHF and millimeter wave communication systems but also to transmit data over a longer distance with lower BERs.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3182164","Key Project of National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61931004); National High Technology 863(grant numbers:2015AAXXX); Basic Scientific Research Funds of the Ministry of Education(grant numbers:N110404035); General Project of Education Department of Liaoning Province(grant numbers:L2015016); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9793396","Adaptive modulation algorithm;Doppler frequency offset;joint source-channel coding scheme;maritime THz communication system","Wireless communication;Doppler effect;Frequency modulation;Modulation;Communication systems;High frequency;Adaptive systems","channel coding;combined source-channel coding;error statistics;feedback;linear codes;marine communication;network coding;Reed-Solomon codes;telecommunication network reliability;wireless channels","higher transmission rate;long communication distance;Doppler frequency;maritime environment;communication parties;adversarial maritime factors;extreme sea states;THz system;communication efficiency up to 20Gbps;millimeter wave communication systems;novel adaptive terahertz system;efficient maritime communications;hostile sea conditions;terahertz frequency band;indoor space communications;outdoor space communications;significant path loss;unacceptable signal error rate;maritime communication system;above-mentioned challenge;joint source-channel coding scheme;system random linear network coding;Reed-Solomon;transmission reliability;transmission efficiency;triple-channel communication architecture;high frequency feedback channel;source data;THz main channel;coding redundancy;auxiliary channel;adaptive mechanism","","","","58","CCBYNCND","10 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The methodology is based on a five-step iteration process: once having identified the requirements, required input data and the design variables, the ideated configuration is evaluated using DHMs in order to retrieve objective measurements (i.e., interferences, visibility, reachability); finally, a subjective assessment within immersive VR environment is conducted. A real-time RULA analysis is carried out on DHMs, calibrated on selected users representing specific percentages of target population, by means of a full-body tracking system. The subjective assessment in immersive VR allows to take into account also other human factors (i.e. human ability, dexterity and cognitive aspects) that have not been previously considered and may significatively influence the validation of the final design configuration of MPA interiors.","","979-8-3503-9657-7","10.1109/MetroInd4.0IoT57462.2023.10180136","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10180136","Digital Human Modeling;Digital Mock-up;Virtual Reality;Ergonomic Validation;Maritime Aircraft","Solid modeling;Target tracking;Ergonomics;Atmospheric modeling;Sociology;Virtual reality;Real-time systems","aircraft;ergonomics;human factors;observers;virtual reality","cognitive aspects;DHMs;digital human models;ergonomic evaluation process;full-body tracking system;human factors;human-centered design methodology;immersive virtual reality tools;immersive VR environments;interiors design;iteration process;maritime patrol aircrafts interiors;MPA interiors;objective measurements;observer window area;operator console area;optimal ergonomic design configuration;RULA analysis;subjective measurements","","","","19","IEEE","18 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To tackle these problems, in this paper, we propose a game based USV fleet-assisted data sharing scheme to enable data exchange among USVs. Specially, we firstly propose a data publish/subscribe framework, where USVs are categorized into publishers and subscribers, and a USV fleet is motivated as a broker to relay data from publishers to subscribers. Then, the optimal waypoints for data publishing are recommended to the USV fleet to improve its probability of acquiring data. Furthermore, a Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) reverse auction game is utilized for data publishing, which ensures that the data publishers bid for USV fleets with own truthful costs, so as to avoid false bidding of data publishers. A double auction game is then employed for data subscription, which balances the benefits between the USV fleet and the data subscriber. An incentive-based data sharing algorithm is finally designed to obtain the optimal bidding strategies for all game parties including data publishers, USV fleets and data subscribers. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme efficiently increases the utilities of all participants, as compared to conventional schemes.","2327-4697","","10.1109/TNSE.2023.3299462","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10196037","Maritime communication networks;data publish/subscribe;USV fleet;auction game","Costs;Publishing;Oceans;Relays;Maritime communications;Games;Data models","","","","","","","IEEE","27 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Based on the theoretical foundation of the ship domain model in the field of ships, the area where collision danger exists is found by guiding the ship domain model, and this area is used as the routing flood area, and the routing request is limited to this area. The improved AODV (Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector) routing forwarding algorithm is used to establish a communication link between ships in the routing request area using real-time location information. This can exchange more information with ships located in the collision risk area to assist in collaborative obstacle avoidance and prevent accidents. At the same time, it effectively avoids network-wide routing flooding, avoids network congestion, and ensures network stability.

In harsh environment, it is vital for BiSAR to conduct extensive surveillance, imaging, and recognition of maritime ship targets. However, under the disturbance of sea waves, the ship target has an unknown and massive 3-D rotation, so that its imaging projection plane (IPP) is also undetermined. Thus, high-dimensional random distortion appears in imaging results, making it difficult to recognize the target through 2-D distorted images effectively. To solve these problems, BiSAR maritime ship target 3-D image reconstruction method without distortion in local Cartesian coordinate (LCC) is proposed. In this article, according to positions of scatterers and rotation parameters, significant differences of different scatterers of maritime ship targets have been found in bistatic range, Doppler centroid (DC), and Doppler frequency rate (DFR), which lays a solid foundation for the scatterer separation of ship targets. On this basis, a 3-D R-DC-DFR domain is constructed, and 2-D echoes of the maritime ship target are projected into R-DC-DFR domain to separate scatterers. Then, by remapping data of transmitter and receiver in R-DC-DFR domain to LCC, as well as evaluating their similarity metric, the optimal rotation parameters of the ship target can be obtained via the maximal similarity. Therefore, the image distortion caused by the unknown IPP has been removed, and 3-D image reconstruction of ship targets can be realized without distortion in the LCC. Furthermore, to evaluate performances of 3-D image reconstruction for different rotation parameters and bistatic configurations, 3-D reconstruction index is proposed and analyzed.

In this context, the knowledge of accurate and reliable information about a ship’s position is a fundamental requirement for navigation and for avoiding accidents. This is valid for both maritime navigation and inland navigation. For this reason, the information about Position, Navigation, and Time (PNT) is necessary for the safety and efficiency of ship movement, especially in high-density traffic areas such as port entrances, channels or inland waterways. In this context, the GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) has become the main source of PNT for maritime navigation. However, in some critical conditions, the use of GNSS alone have some shortfalls, especially in coastal navigation, with the consequent need to enhance accuracy and integrity information. Such enhancement can be available from augmentation techniques. Among them, the users can take advantage of Satellite-Based Augmentation Systems (SBASs). In particular, in the current work, the performance of European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS) augmentation are verified in terms of accuracy in position domain showing evident improvements, especially on vertical component of the position.","","978-1-6654-1458-6","10.1109/MetroSea52177.2021.9611552","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9611552","Maritime;SBAS;EGNOS;Positioning","Global navigation satellite system;Sea measurements;Receivers;Data collection;Seaports;Satellite navigation systems;Safety","Global Positioning System;marine navigation;ships","maritime navigation;maritime community;shipping safety;inland navigation;ship movement;inland waterways;Global Navigation Satellite System;coastal navigation;integrity information;European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service augmentation;EGNOS performances assessment","","","","18","IEEE","19 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The path between any couple of origin and destination points is mainly determined by real-time driver choices, therefore decisions must account for vehicle traffic, waiting phenomena and disruptions experienced by the SCs. So, the proposed simulator embodies a multi-step decision process that mirrors the en-route behavior implemented by the SC drivers as a response to the information they receive during their trip. An event-based view, under stochastic conditions, is adopted to reproduce the point-to-point transfer process for SCs along the internal reticular paths within the Manhattan-like layout of the storage blocks in the yard.

"How Maritime Education and Training (MET) Instructors Address Assessment Protocol","J. Rogin","Department of Curriculum and Instruction, Department of Professional Mariner Training SUNY Maritime, St. John's University","Global Oceans 2020: Singapore – U.S. Gulf Coast","9 Apr 2021","2020","","","1","7","With the advent of more technologies being utilized on a modern Ships Navigational Bridge it is important to address all human elements that play a role in the safety of the vessel. Of these elements, the training of personal in the use of the ships modern equipment is imperative. To address this, the maritime industry both on the international and national levels implements a series of assessments to validate a potential officer's knowledge base. This study looks to identify the Maritime Bridge Simulators instructor's interpretation of the assessments done on a Navigation simulator. An Auto Ethnographic approach is utilized to highlight current and previous interactions with the former Mariners, who are now educators. These Maritime Education and Training (MET) instructors, who utilize a modern Full Mission Bridge Simulator, as they assess a navigational bridge team will be examined. The preliminary understanding and projected findings is that both the performance based assessment and the interactive assessments done on these simulators, inform teaching and enhance learning experiences. However, the assessments themselves which are mandated, are vague and unsuccessful in properly assessing a future Maritime Officer. As Mariners have all experienced some subject matter experts who may have all of the qualifications needed to teach, yet are incapable of doing so. On the other hand, some may not have mastery of the subject but are able to pass on the knowledge needed for one to succeed sufficiently. In a worst-case scenario, there are those who “can neither do nor teach.” How can we prevent these instances from offering? Is there something within mandated regulations that can be used to avoid this from occurring? Could there be a cultural or societal aspect that we can use as a preventative means? These questions are difficult to answer. There is a need to be judged on many levels, as well as discussed and debated. Instructors in the Maritime industry are no different than the Instructors in other fields. They have all been exposed to the subject that they are required to teach, how they prepare and interpret the lessons needed is not always the same as one would think. Simulation as an educational tool has been used across a broad spectrum of subjects and industries. How these simulations are integrated within the classroom differs depending on the simulator. One of the main objectives of simulation is Project-Based learning. Simulations that encompass the Project-Based Learning design can be defined as complex tasks based on difficult questions. These situations provoke the student to design, implement problem-solving, and decision making processes. The fact-finding activities embedded in the simulation can provide students with situations where they need to work independently over significant periods. At the end of the simulation, there is a concluding event that emulates realistic products or situations [1]. In addition to the “Project” associated with this theory, there are other defining factors; these factors include authentic content, authentic assessment, teacher facilitation, and clear educational goals[2]. All of these play a significant role within the realm of Maritime Simulation. For a successful Simulation of a Ships Navigational bridge to occur, the preliminary understanding and projected findings is that the performance-based assessment and the interactive assessments done on these simulators, inform teaching and enhance learning experiences. In order to accomplish this, many challenges are facing the educators that operate these simulated exercises. The first challenge is the Professional Development of the educators. Unlike most professional educators, the requirements to teach within this field are limited. The students that these instructors teach also differ in that they are an older student. This method is called Andragogy. The way the instructor approaches this must be different from the Petrological approach of young students. The final challenge addressed here is the instructor's interpretation of both international and national regulations. By utilizing Authentic Assessment, educators need to cultivate a better understanding of the concept or subject taught and focus less on the improved learning outcomes associated with them [3].","0197-7385","978-1-7281-5446-6","10.1109/IEEECONF38699.2020.9389301","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9389301","Project-Based Learning;Maritime Education and Training;Performance-based Assessment;Maritime Simulation;Instructor Training;Professional Development;Andragogy;Authentic Assessment","Industries;Bridges;Navigation;Tools;Regulation;Task analysis;Marine vehicles","computer based training;decision making;educational courses;marine engineering;ships;teaching","assessment protocol;MET;human elements;modern ships navigational bridge;maritime bridge simulators instructor;future maritime officer;project-based learning design;maritime simulation;MET Instructors;maritime education and training instructors;international regulations;professional educators;simulated exercises;performance-based assessment;clear educational goals;authentic assessment;educational tool;subject matter experts;learning experiences;teaching;interactive assessments;performance based assessment;preliminary understanding;navigational bridge team;modern Full Mission Bridge Simulator;Mariners;Auto Ethnographic approach;navigation simulator;potential officer;international levels;maritime industry;ships modern equipment","","","","30","IEEE","9 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

By decoupling content from location and storing popular content in caches ICNs enable content access even when content producers are disconnected from the network. However, network-resource constraints, node mobility, and low data rates remain as major challenges to achieve the potential benefits that increased data bring to maritime networks. In this work, we propose an ICN architecture that uses dedicated caches and off-path caching to deliver popular network content to consumers. Our architecture motivates a data-caching problem in which each cache must define effective and efficient caching policies, with effectiveness assessed based on the cache-hit ratio achieved by the cache and efficiency assessed based on the usage of the communications budget allocated for data caching purposes. This work develops an online caching algorithm that enables dedicated caches to sequentially decide what content to cache. The online caching decision making problem is formulated using the contextual multi-armed bandits framework. The performance of the online caching algorithm is illustrated via simulation examples on synthetic data.","","979-8-3503-3226-1","10.1109/OCEANSLimerick52467.2023.10244405","Naval Information Warfare Center Pacific; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10244405","Data caching;maritime networking;contextual multi-armed bandits;information centric networking","Oceans;Information-centric networking;Decision making;Synthetic data","cache storage;decision making;Internet","cache-hit ratio;caches ICNs;content access;content producers;contextual multiarmed bandits framework;data caching purposes;data-caching problem;dedicated caches;efficient caching policies;ICN architecture;increased data;information centric networking;intermittently-connected lossy maritime networks;low data rates;network-resource constraints;off-path caching;online caching algorithm;online caching decision making problem;popular network content;storing popular content;synthetic data","","","","15","USGov","12 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Today's military services have faced challenges of maintaining financial stability of training activities. Thus most of them focus into computational simulators can be used as a safe alternative in a cost beneficial manner. Considering field of military, radar simulators plays important role in simulations. This research focuses on simulating sea-born radar for 3D virtual maritime environment. Proposed approach takes the 3D environment as the input and maps the objects via electromagnetic wave properties. It captures the surrounding objects and gives the 2D visualization of the 3D environment as the end result. In the static environment perception both radar and environment are considered to be stagnant. This approach uses efficient techniques to achieve a 2D visualization of the 3D environment by embedding electromagnetic wave properties like reflection, refraction, polarization, diffraction and attenuation in wave propagation.

Renner","Advanced Technology Systems, Inc., Arlington, VA, USA","IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","6 Jan 2003","1977","2","3","229","238","The existing international VHF maritime mobile communication system dates back to the 1947 International Radio Conference at Atlantic City, NJ. At that time, there was formal agreement on the place in the spectrum (built around the use of 156.80 MHz), and informal agreement on the use of a channel bandwidth of 100 kHz. This paper documents the events leading to the development of the maritime mobile VHF allocation structure in the United States in 1948 (Special Committee 7 of Radio Technical Commission for Marine Services). The establishment of a multichannel structure and basic rules for system operation are explained. The paper describes the subsequent adoption of the structure (FCC Rules and Regulations, 1952) by the maritime nations of Europe at the Hague, Holland, in 1957 and by the countries of the world at the International Radio Conference in Geneva, Switzerland, 1959. A description is given of the early and rapid growth of the US VHF structure on the Great Lakes, for safety and navigational purposes, and the expansion upon this usage in Europe to accomplish widespread port operations services. Major steps forward were taken in 1967 at the International Radio Conference on Maritime Mobile Services at Geneva, and in the promulgation of the FCC Rules of 1969. These actions established the 25-kHz channel bandwidth now in use. The availability, after 1968, of low-cost multichannel equipment, coupled with the increased channel availability of the new Rules set in motion a steady growth in usage by small vessels. More recent trends include the expanded usage of VHF to meet increased responsibilities of the US Coast Guard (USCG) for vessel management services and for surveillance of vessel operations. Reference is made to the current use of automation-for efficient systems management and for data exchanges between ship and shore-on the Great Lakes, and to the planning for introduction of automation on the inland rivers of the United States.","1558-1691","","10.1109/JOE.1977.1145353","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1145353","","Mobile communication;Bandwidth;FCC;Europe;Lakes;Cities and towns;Safety;Radio navigation;Surveillance;Marine vehicles","","Governmental regulations;Marine-vehicle communication;Radio spectrum management;VHF radio communication","","","","18","IEEE","6 Jan 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The task offloading and resource scheduling problem is modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP), in which the objective is to maximize the overall performance of the system with the consideration of the physical layer security (PLS). An offloading decision is made based on the channel qualities between USVs and UAV, task queue status and task information of USVs. In order to deal with the high-dimensional curse of state and action space, we propose a computational offloading algorithm based on the twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) to learn the optimal strategy without requiring a priori knowledge of the environment.

The currently widely adopted segmentation-based obstacle detection methods are prone to misclassification of object reflections and sun glitter as obstacles, producing many false positive detections, effectively rendering the methods impractical for USV navigation. However, water-turbulence-induced temporal appearance changes on object reflections are very distinctive from the appearance dynamics of true objects. We harness this property to design WaSR-T, a novel maritime obstacle detection network, that extracts the temporal context from a sequence of recent frames to reduce ambiguity. By learning the local temporal characteristics of object reflection on the water surface, WaSR-T substantially improves obstacle detection accuracy in the presence of reflections and glitter. Compared with existing single-frame methods, WaSR-T reduces the number of false positive detections by 41% overall and by over 53% within the danger zone of the boat, while preserving a high recall, and achieving new state-of-the-art performance on the challenging MODS maritime obstacle detection benchmark.

Today, the role of traditional museums has shifted to become multipurpose in order to offer tangible and intangible products and services to their visitors. The tourism industry in Malaysia is heavily depending on their rich multiethnic and religion culture since the 50's. However, the progress of the museums in Malaysia is going at a slow phase although cultural tourism growth in the country is soaring. Any changes involving the museum sector in Malaysia went through a complicated process because it had to go through several stages and time consuming. The museum sector in Malaysia is lacking of creative management and administration style. Malaysia museum sector is left far behind almost 30 years compared to other developed countries. Notwithstanding, for the past ten years more Malaysian museums are shifting their roles to become modern museums by adapting creative ideas and technology. This study applied case study method on Malacca Maritime Museum. This is a traditional museum which comes up with new and fresh ideas by combining traditional, creativity and ICT elements to become modern museum. Hence, this museum remains competitive with other tourism attractions in Malaysia and the region.","","978-1-4577-1634-8","10.1109/ISBEIA.2012.6422997","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6422997","museum;traditional museum;modern museum;cultural tourism;creativity","Cultural differences;Cities and towns;Government;Industries;Global communication;Art;History","","","","","","34","IEEE","31 Jan 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, conventional means of maritime communication prevent the UAV and the USV from providing high-rate services owing to complex maritime channel conditions and limited bandwidth, which will affect the maritime environment monitoring performance. In this paper, we propose a USV-UAV collaborative patrol scheme for maritime environment monitoring networks. Considering the characteristic of energy concentration in beamforming and the beam deviation caused by UAV jitter due to the harsh ocean condition, we studied an adaptive anti-jitter beamforming problem in UAV-assisted maritime environment monitoring networks. Specifically, we decompose the adaptive anti-jitter beamforming problem into two subproblems. In the first sub-problem, the location deployment of UAV and beam gain allocation is optimized via an iterative search algorithm based on ideal beamforming. In the second sub-problem, anti-jitter beamforming design is solved by an adaptive particle swarm optimization algorithm based on social learning, which effectively improves the average spectral efficiency of the system. Finally, the simulation results show that the proposed algorithm has good adaptability under different jitter amplitudes and effectively improves the spectral efficiency without increasing the complexity.","2377-8644","979-8-3503-4538-4","10.1109/ICCC57788.2023.10233419","Research and Development; National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10233419","maritime environment monitoring;anti-jitter beamforming;UAV;USV","Adaptive systems;Array signal processing;Spectral efficiency;Simulation;Oceans;Jitter;Autonomous aerial vehicles","array signal processing;autonomous aerial vehicles;Internet of Things;iterative methods;marine communication;particle swarm optimisation;remotely operated vehicles;search problems;unmanned surface vehicles","adaptive anti-jitter beamforming problem;adaptive particle swarm optimization algorithm;anti-jitter beamforming design;complex maritime channel conditions;different jitter amplitudes;harsh ocean condition;high-rate services;ideal beamforming;maritime communication;maritime environment monitoring performance;smart ocean;UAV jitter;UAV-assisted maritime environment monitoring networks;UAV-assisted maritime monitoring networks;unmanned aerial vehicles;unmanned surface vehicles;USV-UAV collaborative patrol scheme","","","","14","IEEE","5 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

First of all, the task of maritime oil spill emergency monitoring and the monitoring subjects carrying out the tasks are identified, and the specific types, difficulties and risks of the tasks are identified. Then, the task type is introduced to indirectly express the relationship between ‘monitoring subject-task’. On this basis, two concepts of task demand satisfaction and emergency monitoring subject capability competency are proposed to express the preference information of bilateral subjects. And then on the basis of redefining the specific connotation of the basic concept of bilateral matching theory under the background of maritime oil spill emergency monitoring task allocation, a bilateral matching model for task allocation of maritime oil spill emergency monitoring considering attribute priority is constructed. Finally, according to the specific characteristics of the model, a fast generation algorithm of feasible solution is designed to solve the problem.

We aim to improve situation awareness and threat detection capabilities in maritime scenarios by combining sensor-based information with context information and intelligence from various sources. The fusion and analysis in order to reveal suspect from normal behavior is based on domain ontologies. A test bed allows the study of various exploitation and assessments techniques applied to these domain ontologies.

The variations of horizontal distance and height are calculated according to the refractivity distribution. Eigenrays between transmitter (Tx) and receiver (Rx) are determined by tracing the ray trajectories. Furthermore, the path loss, delay spread, and angles of arrival (AoAs) are estimated. Simulation results calculated by the RT method match theoretical results generated by parabolic equation (PE) methods in the short range. In the B-LoS range, the path loss estimated by RT is a bit higher than that estimated by PE. In the RT model, the increase in the number of rays calculated in the B-LoS range may lead to this case.

By doing so, the individual economic and scientific agents can be spared the enormous effort of creating and maintaining their own, particular set of equivalent capabilities, thus drastically lowering their initial operating costs. In addition to cost savings, operating based on fully-fledged, shared infrastructures not only allows the use of more advanced scientific equipment and highly skilled personnel, but it also enables the business teams (be it industry or research) to focus on their goals, rather than on equipment, logistics, and support. This paper will describe the TEC4SEA infrastructure, created precisely to operate as described. This infrastructure has been under implementation in the last few years, and has now entered its operational phase. This paper will describe it, present its current portfolio of services, and discuss the most relevant assets and facilities that have been recently acquired, so that the research and industrial communities requiring the use of such assets can fully evaluate their adequacy for their own purposes and projects.","","979-8-3503-3226-1","10.1109/OCEANSLimerick52467.2023.10244521","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10244521","Blue economy;robotics;research infrastructure;deep sea","Industries;Costs;Oceans;Personnel;Portfolios;Business;Logistics","autonomous underwater vehicles;geophysics computing;investment;maintenance engineering;oceanographic techniques;sustainable development","advanced scientific equipment;business teams;cost savings;enormous effort;equivalent capabilities;external entities;highly skilled personnel;individual economic agents;initial operating costs;maritime technology;operational phase;particular set;scientific agents;successful maritime operations;sustainable blue economy;TEC4SEA infrastructure;technological infrastructures","","","","5","IEEE","12 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

At present, there are many methods for related research, but there are still problems such as a large number of parameters and a high computational cost. Based on this, this article proposes a new efficient and controllable capsule network method for maritime moving target classification research. First, a non-iterative attention routing is constructed to reduce the number of parameters and weaken the dependence of the previous capsule layer on the next capsule layer in the routing process. Second, a controllable routing algorithm is proposed, which can reduce the number of routing and computational cost dynamically according to the complexity of samples and has strong flexibility.

In order to overcome the related resource constraints, DNN inference tasks are generally offloaded to the cloud or nearby powerful nodes. However, the existing work fails to effectively arrange resources for DNN inference tasks in a cluster environment. Here, we innovatively proposed DNN inference acceleration (DIA), an approach based on DNN fine-grained partitioning and offloading, to accelerate DNN inference in cluster environment. Specifically, we study the parallel execution of DNN inference on multiple devices. The proposed strategy includes a fine-grained partitioning algorithm of DNN (DIA-FP), and an offloading algorithm (DIA-O) based on the overlapping coalition structure formation method. Results obtained by using a large-scale dataset of ships and four DNN benchmarks show that compared with other partitioning and offloading methods, the proposed method significantly reduces the total inference time of DNN, and the inference speed is $\mathbf{1}.\mathbf{2}\times$ to $\mathbf{2}.\mathbf{9}\times$ faster.","","979-8-3503-4043-3","10.1109/Ucom59132.2023.10257649","National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2020YFB1806800); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10257649","DNN inference;task offloading;fine-grained partitioning;receptive field;overlapping coalition structure","Memory management;Clustering algorithms;Collaboration;Artificial neural networks;Benchmark testing;Inference algorithms;Partitioning algorithms","","","","","","11","IEEE","27 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In a good training simulation not only the static environment but also the dynamic surrounding ships plays a major role in terms of behaviour realism. The surrounding ships also need to navigate according to COLREG (Convention on International Regulation for Preventing Collisions at Sea) navigational rules. This research presents a novel approach to automate the surrounding vessels in a marine simulation environment with a central controller to control the behaviours of each surrounding vessel in the marine environment. The controller uses positioning data of real ships which are derived from a set of historical Automatic Identification System (AIS) data and map the positioning data with the surrounding ships in virtual environment to obtain the navigation. An Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm is used to avoid the collisions by generating a new path when both trainee's ship and surrounding ships are in the vicinity of each other. The collision handling mechanism uses COLREG rules. The ACO algorithm generates successful collision avoided paths in all head-on, crossing and over-taking encountering situations. The number of turning points is used to measure the smoothness of the path and number of obstacles in the environment and number of nodes in the graph affects the smoothness of the path. With these results it is revealed that AIS data can be used as an assistant to automate surrounding vessels in a virtual maritime environment together with a proper collision avoidance mechanism.","","978-1-4799-7732-1","10.1109/ICTER.2014.7083883","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7083883","AIS;Ant Colony Optimization (ACO);collision avoidance;autonomous navigation;surrounding ships;target ships;ship handling simulators","Radio frequency","ant colony optimisation;collision avoidance;marine navigation;ships;virtual reality","virtual maritime environment;surrounding ships automation;surrounding vessels;marine simulation environment;central controller;Automatic Identification System;historical AIS data;ant colony optimization;ACO algorithm;collision avoidance;collision handling mechanism;Convention on International Regulation for Preventing Collisions at Sea;COLREG navigational rules;head-on situations;over-taking encountering situations;crossing situations","","","","12","IEEE","16 Apr 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Individual decision-making is taken as a node in workflow, and the network workflow among decision-making units is examined in a larger scope by establishing the interactive network between nodes. On this basis, the control model of human decision-making errors is further constructed, including the accumulation, transmission and correction of decision-making errors.

The main technical difficulties include 1) the nonstationary and non-Gaussian nature of sea clutter when using a high-resolution airborne radar and 2) low-target signal-to-interference ratios due to higher grazing angles. It is proposed to carry out processing in two stages. First, space-time adaptive processing (STAP) is applied to exploit the spatial and temporal degrees of freedom available in the multichannel radar. Subsequently, target detection and tracking is performed using the track-before-detect method, applied to the STAP output. For the sake of comparison, a more traditional tracking method is also developed, where a detection threshold is applied to the STAP output, to obtain point measurements, subsequently processed via an extended target tracking methodology. The error performance of the proposed methodology is presented, using high-fidelity radar data generation","1557-9603","","10.1109/TAES.2022.3211483","Defence Science and Technology Group; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9907818","Airborne scanning radar;extended target tracking;maritime surveillance;spatiotemporal adaptive processing;track-before-detect (TBD)","Radar;Radar tracking;Target tracking;Clutter;Radar detection;Azimuth;Airborne radar","airborne radar;object detection;radar clutter;radar detection;radar signal processing;space-time adaptive processing;target tracking","airborne multichannel radar;airborne scanning multichannel radar;detection threshold;extended target tracking methodology;high altitudes;high-fidelity radar data generation;high-resolution airborne radar;higher grazing angles;low-target signal-to-interference ratios;main technical difficulties;maritime domain;maritime targets;sea clutter;space-time adaptive processing;STAP output;target detection;track-before-detect method;traditional tracking method","","","","28","IEEE","3 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

(CyCon)","4 Jul 2022","2022","700","","331","345","Her Majesty’s Naval Base (HMNB) Devonport is a complex maritime site in Plymouth, United Kingdom (UK). Using digital twin technology, the authors will model and simulate the physical entity of the dockyard to optimize for a set of critical priorities. Digital twins are virtual representations of a physical entity, such as a vehicle. They can fully model a complex environment, accurately modelling individual layers within the entity, with each layer accessing data required from other layers. This results in an accurate simulation so that when changes are made in one layer of the model, the impact across the other layers may be observed. An end-user could interact with this digital twin to understand how changing input parameters would affect the measured outputs, allowing the end-users to simulate different options and compare the simulated outcomes before deciding a course of action. If the digital twin is of higher fidelity, the simulated outcomes would be more accurate and demonstrate potentially unintended effects allowing for a more comprehensive overview for the decision-maker. From this digital twin, a decision-maker can manually identify the best parameters to simulate the outcomes through the digital twin. However, using multi-objective optimization can reduce this process so that the twin can create the inputs, monitor the outcomes, and repeatedly try to produce a specific number of outcomes to choose from. These outcomes would be based on a few priorities initially set, and the optimizer would change inputs to enhance each of these priorities. At HMNB Devonport, three main priorities have been identified: cost reduction, time efficiency and carbon neutrality.","2325-5374","978-9916-9789-1-7","10.23919/CyCon55549.2022.9811082","Ministry of Defence; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9811082","digital twin;visualization;multi-objective optimization;dockyard logistics","Costs;Data models;Digital twins;Carbon;Optimization;Monitoring;Logistics","cost reduction;decision making;naval engineering computing;optimisation","complex maritime site;multiobjective optimization;digital twin technology;her majestys naval base;United Kingdom;UK;decision-maker;HMNB","","","","24","","4 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In vessel re-ID, contrastive methods are supposed to learn discriminative representation from unlabeled vessel images in an unsupervised manner. However, directly introducing classical instance-level contrastive methods to maritime vessel re-ID suffers from the difficulty of finding vessel images with the same pseudo label as positive images, which potentially leads to inefficient training and unsatisfactory performance. This paper proposes a simple but effective method to solve such a hard positive problem. Our method takes all images in an intra-batch cluster as positives and excludes them from the set of negative samples when computing instance-level contrastive loss. Based on this strategy, we construct a multi-level contrastive learning (MCL) framework for vessel re-ID trained with the specifically designed intra-batch cluster-level contrastive loss along with the instance-level one. Experiments on a newly proposed dataset consisting of 1,248 vessel identities show that MCL achieves the state-of-the-art performance compared with other unsupervised methods.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2023.3243591","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61991411,U1913204); National Key Research and Development Plan of China(grant numbers:2021ZD0112002); Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province for Distinguished Young Scholars(grant numbers:ZR2020JQ29); Project for Self-Developed Innovation Team of Jinan City(grant numbers:2021GXRC038); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10046401","Vessel re-identification;contrastive learning;unsupervised learning","Training;Task analysis;Cameras;Unsupervised learning;Surveillance;Representation learning;Intelligent transportation systems","image representation;object recognition;pattern clustering;unsupervised learning","discriminative representation;instance-level contrastive loss;intra-batch cluster-level contrastive loss;large-scale annotated datasets;marine surveillance;maritime vessel re-ID;MCL;multilevel contrastive learning;positive images;unlabeled vessel images;unsupervised maritime vessel re-identification;vessel identities","","","","69","IEEE","16 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
