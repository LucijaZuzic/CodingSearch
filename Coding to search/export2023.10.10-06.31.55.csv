This work addresses the study and implementation of a visual detection, tracking and three-dimensional positioning method for a specific drone from a moving maritime vessel. The YOLOv5 detector and the OceanPlus tracker have been trained on a custom dataset with good performance in accuracy and processing time. The drone's position with respect to the vessel is estimated by applying stereo triangulation to the centres of the bounding boxes returned by the object detectors and trackers. The performance of the proposed positioning method was evaluated in a realistic simulated environment in the Unreal Game Engine. The proposed method allows detection, tracking, and positioning of a target drone at ranges exceeding 100m while achieving positioning errors below 10cm during landing phases.","","978-1-6654-5496-4","10.1109/ISMCR56534.2022.9950568","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9950568","Object Detection;Tracking;UAV;synthetic data","Visualization;Target tracking;Sea measurements;Detectors;Games;Autonomous aerial vehicles;Robots","autonomous aerial vehicles;computer games;convolutional neural nets;marine control;marine engineering computing;mesh generation;military computing;military robotics;mobile robots;object detection;object tracking;position control;robot vision;stereo image processing","autonomous operation;autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles;maritime military operations;maritime vessel;object detectors;OceanPlus tracker;stereo triangulation;take-off and landing phases;three-dimensional positioning method;unreal game engine;visual drone detection;visual drone tracking;visuasl tracking;YOLOv5 detector","","","","15","IEEE","24 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The ducting effect is one of the thorniest factors since it causes anomalous propagation enhancement and severe co-channel interference. Moreover, the atmospheric attenuation is much more severe in the ocean environment, resulting in shorter coverage distance and more link outage. In this paper, we propose an environmental information-aided electromagnetic propagation testbed. It is based on complex refractivity estimation and improved parabolic equation propagation model, taking into account both ducting effect and atmospheric attenuation. A large-scale temporal and spatial propagation measurement was conducted with meteorological acquisition. We consider practical path loss and ducting conditions to verify the testbed feasibility in these long-distance radio links. The simulation results are in good agreement with the measured data, which further reveal the basic temporal and spatial distribution of ducting effect at 3.5 GHz band.","1673-5447","","10.23919/JCC.2023.03.020","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10091936","broadband maritime communication;maritime channel;ducting effect;electromagnetic propagation testbed;propagation measurement;atmospheric attenuation;path loss","Sea measurements;Atmospheric modeling;Atmospheric measurements;Refractive index;Meteorology;Attenuation;Temperature measurement","electromagnetic wave propagation;marine communication;meteorology;microwave propagation;parabolic equations;radio links;refractive index;telecommunication network reliability","anomalous propagation enhancement;atmospheric attenuation;co-channel interference;complex refractivity estimation;ducting effect;environmental information-aided electromagnetic propagation;frequency 3.5 GHz;key time-varying environmental factors;link outage;long-distance radio links;maritime channel modeling;maritime communication;meteorological acquisition;ocean environment;parabolic equation propagation model;practical path loss;shorter coverage distance;spatial distribution;spatial propagation measurement;temporal distribution","","","","","","4 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

At the same time, there will be some trading needs. How to realize information exchange and ensure safe transactions is an urgent problem to be solved. To this end, this paper aims to establish a distributed network architecture composed of buoys and base stations (BS) at sea, and uses blockchain technology to solve the problem of the completeness of its decentralized network system. To satisfy the computing requirement companied with the blockchain, buoys and BSs in networks also have the computing ability. Due to the fact that buoys deployed in the ocean are hard to be frequently charged, the energy consumption problem is studied in this paper via the joint optimization of the communication resource and computing resource. We combine the weighted shortest processing time first (WSPT) model and the dynamic frequency and voltage scaling (DVFS) energy consumption model to propose an improved energy-saving algorithm. Finally, numerical results verify the superiority of the proposed algorithm.","","978-1-7281-9216-1","10.1109/HotICN50779.2020.9350806","China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9350806","Mobile edge computing;lightweight blockchain;energy-saving;maritime network","Wireless communication;Energy consumption;Heuristic algorithms;Oceans;Computational modeling;Blockchain;Numerical models","energy conservation;energy consumption;marine communication;optimisation;power aware computing;resource allocation;scheduling","energy-saving resource allocation;lightweight blockchain;maritime wireless communication networks;ocean resource;reliable maritime;communication network;rescue information;business information;surveillance video;information exchange;distributed network architecture;buoys;decentralized network system;energy consumption problem;communication resource;computing resource;energy consumption model;improved energy-saving","","","","16","IEEE","16 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As our first contribution, we formalize the preintegration of linear velocity measurements, obtained by a Doppler velocity log (DVL), in combination with angular velocity measurements, obtained by an inertial measurement unit (IMU), as binary factors encoding relative position. To evaluate state estimation improvements imparted by DVL/IMU fusion, we implement our proposed factor within a state-of-the-art, graph-based lidar-visual-inertial (LVI) SLAM system as our second contribution. Accuracy and robustness improvements are demonstrated in simulation by comparing maximum a posteriori pose estimates with and without DVL/IMU fusion against ground truth poses. As our third contribution, we propose a map generation framework for downstream inspection applications decoupled from SLAM. In our framework, volumetric data (captured by sonar, lidar, etc.) is transformed into a common world coordinate frame using extrinsic calibrations and SLAM pose estimates as input. Our framework operates over the complete set of raw volumetric data, whereas SLAM systems (both online and offline) typically operate over a subset of down-sampled volumetric data. To address the processing of additional volumetric data, we present innovations in refined pose correction and staged filtering for user-controlled denoising. We experimentally evaluate our map generation framework against the LVI SLAM system adopted for this study using real-world data and demonstrate improvements to map quality metrics important to inspection.","1558-1691","","10.1109/JOE.2023.3265742","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; University of California; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10149804","Doppler velocity log;inspection;mapping;sensor fusion;simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM);unmanned surface vehicles (USVs)","Simultaneous localization and mapping;Velocity measurement;Laser radar;Inspection;Sonar;Sea measurements;Robustness","calibration;mobile robots;optical radar;pose estimation;robot vision;SLAM (robots);state estimation;unmanned surface vehicles;velocity measurement","angular velocity measurements;decoupled mapping;downstream inspection applications;graph-based lidar-visual-inertial SLAM system;inertial measurement unit;linear velocity measurements;LVI SLAM system;map generation framework;map quality metrics;SLAM systems;SLAM-centric maritime infrastructure inspection;state estimation improvements","","","","57","IEEE","13 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Specifically, the cooperative UAV can adjust its jamming power and trajectory to exactly control the transmission rate of the suspicious link, thus improving the monitor vessel's surveillance performance. Furthermore, since the cooperative UAV cannot land or replenish energy on the sea surface, its jamming power allocation on the ocean should be carefully designed by the energy thresholds. Under such setup, we formulate a sum eavesdropping rate maximization problem, which jointly optimizes the jamming power and three-dimensional (3D) trajectory of the cooperative UAV, as well as the two-dimensional (2D) trajectory of the monitor vessel. To address this non-convex optimization problem, we decompose the design problem into three subproblems and propose an iterative algorithm to find its suboptimal solution.

The project improved, validated, and demonstrated CISE by extending its scope to land borders and adapting relevant Command and Control solutions and related services. Situation awareness (SA) plays a key role in effective monitoring and decision-making. It is also one of the most challenging parts of the work of any operator. Developing regional information sharing platforms and procedures could be based on existing border and maritime surveillance networks and systems, where European land and maritime border and other relevant law enforcement authorities collaborate regionally to exchange information and advance common security-related issues. The aim of this study is to understand what network designs can promote information sharing between land and maritime border authorities for a common situation picture. Three types of networks are investigated: centralized, decentralized, and hybrid. Each of these network designs have their merit. This paper compares these three types of networks based on how they can be used, which this study presents SWOT tables in its Results section. Each network design could be used as an alternative land and maritime border network, depending on the use case, and we offer evidence that a hybrid network could be beneficial as a choice of architecture for the next generation EUROSUR network.

Sensing GNODE may be equipped with submerged sensors (e.g. water temperature, pressure, salinity, acidity, passive acoustic, SONAR), and/or above water sensors (e.g. air temperature, proximity, sound, light, thermal IR, passive RF, RADAR). Aggregation GNODEs provide absolute location (e.g. GPS or other means) and also long-range communications with the ""Mother Ship"", a satellite or airborne platform, and/or a land-based data center. Ultimately, the data collected by the system can be integrated with reference GIS data (such as existing terrain and sea-bottom maps, as well as other live information. The composite data should be web-accessible with the appropriate level of security to relevant agencies and other authorized users. Currently, breadboard proto-prototype Floater electronics is under development.","2166-1804","978-1-4244-8893-3","10.1109/WSSC.2010.5730253","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5730253","Vital Electronics;Embedded Systems;GIS;SAR;Search and Rescue;PSoC","Geographic Information Systems;Real time systems;Wireless sensor networks;Monitoring;Robot sensing systems;Temperature sensors;Satellites","computer centres;computerised instrumentation;data acquisition;geographic information systems;marine communication;system-on-chip;wireless sensor networks","dynamic GIS;maritime environment;Baltic environment;geospatial information system;natural disaster;man made disaster;search and rescue mission;real time data acquisition;sea based data center;floater;hierarchical network;GNODE;local data aggregation;water sensor;long range communication;satellite;Vital Electronics","","","","11","IEEE","14 Mar 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Surface sea pollution monitoring is usually carried out by visual inspection from aircrafts or ships. However, human inspection is costly and results can vary from observer to observer. Remote sensing technology is a valid alternative to in situ measurements that can reduce costs and risks compared to in situ missions. In this context, aerial platforms provide a convenient tradeoff between coverage and resolution, both spatial and temporal, compared to ship or satellite based surveys. As well, small, unmanned aircrafts have the potential to be very inexpensive to operate, offer more flexibility of operation, and will benefit from active research on reducing size, weight, and power (SWAP) requirements of various sensors. However, the use of a multisensory system on board a commercial small drone is hard to implement considering that it is desirable to make a system reliable and robust.

As an alternative, solar-charged battery-powered surface vessel that can autonomously navigate in maritime waters is proposed. Autonomous surveillance vessels are required to navigate in oceans for an extended time duration, requiring them to use much power in propulsion. To properly manage propulsion power, the vessel design must minimize the drag acting upon the vessel. In this work, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques are used to identify the most suitable type of vessel shape that can minimize the drag and maximize the lift and stability. According to the simulation results, conventional catamaran gondola vessel type gives better performance over others.","","978-1-6654-1821-8","10.1109/OCEANSChennai45887.2022.9861213","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9861213","Autonomous Surface Vessel;Surveillance;CFD","Sea surface;Navigation;Shape;Surveillance;Computational fluid dynamics;Drag;Simulation","boats;computational fluid dynamics;control facilities;drag;marine communication;marine systems;marine vehicles;mobile robots;national security;oceanographic techniques;remotely operated vehicles;surveillance","conventional catamaran gondola vessel type;vessel shape;computational fluid dynamics techniques;propulsion power;extended time duration;autonomous surveillance vessels;maritime waters;solar-charged battery-powered surface vessel;inevitable human errors;repetitive-monotonous nature;sea areas;manned vessels;conventional surveillance methods;criminal activities;continuous surveillance;Earth's surface;oceans cover;maritime environments;autonomous surveillance vessel design;CFD","","","","25","IEEE","22 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The main reasons are as follows: 1) affected by target characteristics and ambient temperature and so on, both bright and dark targets may exist on IR maritime images in practical application and 2) spatial information and temporal correlation of targets are not fully excavated. To these problems, we propose a robust anti-jitter spatial–temporal trajectory consistency (ASTTC) method, the main idea of which is to improve detection accuracy using single-frame detection followed by multi-frame decision. First, we innovatively design adaptive local gradient variation (ALGV) descriptor, which combines local dissimilarity measure with gradient magnitude distribution to enhance the local contrast for both bright and dark targets so that the suspected targets can be robustly extracted. For multi-frame decision, interframe displacement correction is necessary to eliminate the interference of IR imager motion and vibration for target codeword. We use pyramid optical flow to track feature point extracted by Shi-Tomasi to capture interframe registration coefficients. Then, the target position is corrected in the spatial–temporal domain. Finally, a robust spatial–temporal trajectory descriptor (STTD), which achieves target encoding and target trajectory consistency measurement, is designed to further confirm real targets and eliminate false targets. Experiments conducted on various real IR maritime image sequences demonstrate the applicability and robustness of ASTTC, which performs more satisfactorily than the existing methods in detection accuracy.","1558-0571","","10.1109/LGRS.2021.3139617","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China(grant numbers:3132019340,3132019200); High-Tech Ship Research Project from the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of the Peoples Republic of China(grant numbers:MC-201902-C01); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9666901","Adaptive local gradient variation (ALGV);anti-jitter spatial–temporal trajectory consistency (ASTTC);small-target detection","Object detection;Trajectory;Feature extraction;Pipelines;Optical imaging;Target tracking;Adaptive optics","correlation methods;feature extraction;gradient methods;image capture;image motion analysis;image registration;image sequences;infrared imaging;object detection","robust infrared maritime target detection;target characteristics;temporal correlation;single-frame detection;multiframe decision;adaptive local gradient variation descriptor;local dissimilarity measure;gradient magnitude distribution;robust spatial-temporal trajectory descriptor;target encoding;target trajectory consistency measurement;IR maritime image sequences;ASTTC;ALGV descriptor;IR imager motion;Shi-Tomasi;STTD;robust anti-jitter spatial-temporal trajectory consistency;spatial information;interframe registration capture","","","","16","IEEE","30 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Moreover, it complies with the requirements regarding the International Maritime Organization (IMO) guidelines. A proposed analysis method which incorporates HFACS-MA with Why-Because Analysis to provide a comprehensive insight into the accident regarding Herald of Free Enterprise disaster is also demonstrated. This integration may prove beneficial for spotlighting the causalities of the causal factors identified and the vulnerability of the operating system. The reasons that the integration can be deemed as complements to the demographics of a study using HFACS are also discussed in this paper.","","978-1-4673-3070-1","10.1109/ITST.2012.6425205","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6425205","HFACS;Why-Because Analysis;Human factors;Accident analysis","Software;Hardware","accident prevention;disasters;human factors;marine systems;organisational aspects;pattern classification;transportation","marine casualties;HFACS maritime accidents;HFACS-MA;human and organisational factors;HOF;human factors analysis and classification system for maritime accidents;Reason generic error modelling system;Reason GEMS;Hawkins's SHEL model;international maritime organization guidelines;IMO guidelines;why-because analysis;Herald of free enterprise disaster;causal factors;operating system vulnerability","","","","23","IEEE","31 Jan 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Eye gaze control is a method that allows individuals to control a vehicle, device, or application without the use of their hands. It is often intended for those with a disability, but the method can also be used by those without a disability for hands-free operation. Past work on vehicle gaze control has focused primarily on land and aerial vehicles, and has yet to be extended into the field of maritime robotics. This paper discusses a method for gaze controlled underwater ROVs based on ArduSub and MAVLink, with transferability to other vehicle types using ArduPilot. The result of this method is a single script that provides the ability to control a tethered ROV via eye gaze in the directions of ‘up,’ ‘down,’ ‘left yaw,’ ‘right yaw,’ ‘forward,’ and ‘reverse,’ in addition to controlling the vehicle’s lights and arming/disarming the vehicle. In-water demonstrations show successful operation of a gaze controlled ROV with no perceptible time delay.","","979-8-3503-3226-1","10.1109/OCEANSLimerick52467.2023.10244706","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10244706","ROVs;maritime robotics;accessible control;eye tracking;gaze control;ArduPilot","Remotely guided vehicles;Oceans;Delay effects;Robots","autonomous underwater vehicles;control engineering computing;gaze tracking;handicapped aids;interactive devices;mobile robots;robot vision","aerial vehicles;ArduPilot;eye gaze control;gaze controlled underwater ROVs;hands-free operation;joystick-style controllers;land vehicles;maritime robotics;tethered ROV;underwater remotely operated vehicle;upper limb disabilities;vehicle gaze control;vehicle types","","","","37","IEEE","12 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the maritime UAV tracking system, due to the large size of the image computing-task and the shortage of UAV batteries and computational capability, the UAV needs to offload the computing-intensive task to the edge computing server (ECS) to reduce energy consumption and task latency. However, the task latency is still too long for the UAV tracking algorithm due to the large image size. We research the impact of image resolution on the computing task size and detection accuracy, and formulate an edge-aided UAV system with dynamic image resolution. With the constraint on task latency, we jointly optimize the image resolution, offloading rate, transmission power and local central processing unit (CPU) frequency to minimize energy consumption. Although the proposed problem is non-convex, we transform it into a convex optimization problem through decoupling and problem decomposition, and obtain an optimal offloading strategy. The numerical results show the energy efficiency of the proposed strategy by comparing it with the local first offloading strategy and the edge first offloading strategy.","2577-2465","978-1-6654-8243-1","10.1109/VTC2022-Spring54318.2022.9860881","Research and Development; National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9860881","edge computing;UAV;visual target tracking;offload;image resolution","Energy consumption;Vehicular and wireless technologies;Image resolution;Target tracking;Image edge detection;Transforms;Autonomous aerial vehicles","autonomous aerial vehicles;energy conservation;energy consumption;image resolution;marine engineering computing;optimisation;power aware computing","computing-intensive task;edge-aided maritime UAV systems;autonomous detecting;tracking task;unmanned aerial vehicle;maritime environment;image computing-task;UAV batteries;computational capability;edge computing server;energy consumption;UAV tracking algorithm;image size;computing task size;edge-aided UAV system;dynamic image resolution;convex optimization problem;optimal offloading strategy","","","","19","IEEE","25 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Though suspicions were unproven, the effects of the weeklong blockage were global, creating a security warning for national defense professionals. The lesson from the incident is clear – the maritime industry is full of chokepoints that can be economically damaging if exploited. The event also offered a widely covered demonstration event for adversaries seeking future leverage in disruption campaigns. Another demonstration occurred when the winning team at August’s 2021 DefCon “Hack the Sea” event hacked replica maritime control systems without the knowledge of ship operational technology.

Although much progress has been made in anomaly detection and visualization using vessel self-reporting positioning data, there have been no corresponding advances using video data, despite the increasing use of cameras for maritime surveillance. In this work, we introduce a framework which goes beyond vessel tracking for anomaly detection in video, and is therefore applicable to scenes with a high density of vessels. The proposed framework detects abnormal behavior using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and interprets this knowledge using metrics derived from clustering the positions and courses provided by an independent vessel/motion detector.

The anomaly is modeled as a binary (on/off) switching unknown control input that goes into action (begins to exist, or “switches on”) thereby modifying the object dynamics; and by ceasing its activity (becoming nonexistent, or “switching off”) returns the dynamics to nominal. The developed Bayesian framework brings together random finite set (RFS) theory to represent the switching nature of the anomaly, and optimal joint input and state estimation to sequentially update a hybrid state that incorporates a random vector for the kinematic state and a Bernoulli RFS for the unknown control input. In addition, a closed-form solution, the Gaussian-mixture hybrid Bernoulli filter (GM-HBF), has been developed to provide a customized solution for dynamic anomaly detection in the maritime domain characterized by linear Gaussian target dynamics. Based on the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck dynamic model for vessels, where the evolution of the object velocity is governed by a piecewise mean-reverting stochastic process, the anomaly can be represented by a change in the long-run mean velocity (i.e., the unknown control input) from the nominal condition that forces the vessel to deviate from its standard route. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed GM-HBF in both simulated and real-world maritime surveillance applications and test its performance in the face of false measurements, detection uncertainty, and sensor data gaps.","1557-9603","","10.1109/TAES.2021.3122888","NATO Allied Command Transformation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9596595","Automatic identification system (AIS);radar;Bayesian filtering;Bernoulli filter;joint input and state estimation (JISE);maritime anomaly detection;random finite sets (RFSs);target tracking","Anomaly detection;Bayes methods;Switches;Radio frequency;Mathematical models;Aerodynamics;Radar tracking","Bayes methods;filtering theory;Gaussian processes;probability;state estimation;stochastic processes;surveillance;target tracking","detection uncertainty;Bayesian filtering;dynamic anomaly detection;Bayesian approach;switching unknown control input;object dynamics;developed Bayesian framework;state estimation;kinematic state;Bernoulli RFS;Gaussian-mixture hybrid Bernoulli filter;GM-HBF;linear Gaussian target dynamics;Ornstein-Uhlenbeck dynamic model","","8","","54","IEEE","1 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The design of the method, called DaCUP (Detection of anomalies as Consistent Unpredictable Patches), is based on two general properties of anomalous objects: an anomaly is (i) not from a class that could be modelled and (ii) it is not similar (in appearance) to non-anomalous objects in the image. To this end, we propose a novel embedding bottleneck in an auto-encoder like architecture that enables modelling of a diverse, multi-modal known class appearance (e.g. road). Secondly, we introduce novel image-conditioned distance features that allow known class identification in a nearest-neighbour manner on-the-fly, greatly increasing its ability to distinguish true and false positives. Lastly, an inpainting module is utilized to model the uniqueness of detected anomalies and significantly reduce false positives by filtering regions that are similar, thus reconstructable from their neighbourhood. We demonstrate that filtering of regions based on their similarity to neighbour regions, using e.g. an inpainting module, is general and can be used with other methods for reduction of false positives. The proposed method is evaluated on several publicly available datasets for road anomaly detection and on a maritime benchmark for obstacle avoidance. The method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both tasks with the same hyper-parameters with no domain specific design.","2642-9381","978-1-6654-9346-8","10.1109/WACV56688.2023.00545","Toyota Motor Europe; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10030141","Algorithms: Image recognition and understanding (object detection;categorization;segmentation)","Computer vision;Filtering;Roads;Design methodology;Benchmark testing;Feature extraction;Task analysis","feature extraction;image restoration;mobile robots;nearest neighbour methods;object detection;road vehicles","anomalous objects;auto-encoder;autonomous driving;class identification;DaCUP;detection of anomalies as consistent unpredictable patches;domain specific design;image-conditioned distance features;image-consistent detection;inpainting module;multimodal known class appearance;nearest-neighbour manner;nonanomalous objects;obstacle avoidance;road anomaly detection","","","","47","IEEE","6 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The recent build-up of terrestrial networks and satellite constellations of Automatic Identification System (AIS) receivers provides a rich source of cooperative vessel movement information. This vast amount of information can not be fully utilized by human operators and poses new storage and computational challenges. A compact representation of this rapidly increasing amount of information gives operational utility to data which would otherwise be ignored. This paper proposes an unsupervised and incremental learning approach to extract the historical traffic patterns from AIS data. The presented methodology called Traffic Route Extraction for Anomaly Detection (TREAD) effectively processes raw AIS data to infer different levels of contextual information, spanning from the identification of ports and off-shore platforms to spatial and temporal distributions of traffic routes. Furthermore, the accurate understanding of the historical traffic enables the classification and prediction of vessel behaviours as well as the detection of low-likelihood behaviours, or anomalies. The ultimate goal is to provide operators with a configurable knowledge framework supporting day by day decision making and general awareness of vessel pattern of life activity. The methodology is demonstrated via a real-world case study, which can be used as a reference data set for further analysis.","","978-1-4799-0284-2","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6641250","","Entropy;Data mining;Receivers;Trajectory;Knowledge discovery;Surveillance;Vectors","data mining;marine engineering;traffic information systems;unsupervised learning","traffic knowledge discovery;maritime situational awareness;maritime traffic patterns;automatic identification system;operational utility;incremental learning approach;unsupervised learning approach;historical traffic patterns;traffic route extraction for anomaly detection;TREAD;raw AIS data;low-likelihood behaviours;configurable knowledge framework","","5","","34","","21 Oct 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Multiple features extracted from radar returns in different domains have ability but not enough to solely distinguish radar returns with target from sea clutter. Joint exploitation of multiple features becomes the key to improve detection performance. In this article, the K-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm and anomaly detection idea are cooperated to develop a novel sea-surface target detection method in the feature space spanned by the eight existing salient features. The detection is realized by the anomaly detection followed by a specially designed KNN-based classifier with a controllable false alarm rate. In the anomaly detection, a decision region is determined by the hyper-spherical coverage of the training set of sea clutter that is sufficient and ergodic in the feature space. The KNN-based classifier is designed based on the training sample set of sea clutter and the training sample set of simulated target returns plus sea clutter that is sufficient but nonergodic, by joint usage of feature weighting, neighbor weighting, and distance weighting. The novel method is validated by the two open and recognized IPIX and CSIR radar databases for sea-surface small target detection. The results show that it provides significant performance improvement in comparison with the existing multiple-feature-based detection methods, owing to the fact that the novel method avoids the dimension restriction and feature compression loss in the existing methods.","1557-9603","","10.1109/TAES.2020.3011868","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61871303); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9149659","Anomaly detection framework;feature compression loss;K-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier with controllable false alarm rate;sea clutter;sea-surface small target detection","Training;Radar clutter;Radar detection;Object detection;Feature extraction;Clutter;Anomaly detection","feature extraction;marine radar;nearest neighbour methods;object detection;radar clutter;radar computing;radar detection","sea clutter;training sample set;anomaly based sea-surface;high-resolution maritime ubiquitous radars;neighbor algorithm;anomaly detection idea;sea-surface target detection method;multiple-feature-based detection methods;weak target return simulation;feature weighting space;KNN-based classifier design;CSIR radar databases;IPIX radar databases;k-nearest neighbor algorithm","","31","","38","IEEE","27 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, such regions may contain subtle texture anomalies which indicate the presence of a feature of interest such as a change in tree density due to environmental effects, damping of the sea surface due to the presence of pollutants or the presence of land-based or maritime military targets. For this reason, it is of interest to develop methods of detecting anomalies in textured regions. A strategy for texture anomaly detection is to estimate the multi-variate probability density function (PDF) of a texture segment using the whole homogeneous region as training data and then to calculate the likelihood of occurrence of each individual segment within the region given the PDF estimate.

This amounts to modeling the anomaly as an unknown switching control input that can affect the dynamics of the object. Under this model, the problem of joint anomaly detection and tracking can be addressed within the Bayesian random set framework by means of a hybrid Bernoulli filter (HBF) that sequentially estimates a Bernoulli random set (empty under nominal behavior) for the unknown long-run mean velocity, and a random vector for the kinematic state of the object. An additional challenge is represented by the fact that two extra parameters, i.e. the reversion rate and the noise covariance of the underlying OU process, need to be specified for Bayes-optimal prediction.

In view of this, an anomaly detection model for ship trajectory data based on Gaussian Mixture Variational Autoencoder (GMVAE) is proposed in this study using an unsupervised classification method. The proposed model modifies Variational Autoencoder (VAE) by changing the inferential distribution of prior distribution and approximate posterior to the Gaussian mixture model. A high-dimensional hidden space is constructed to learn the features of multi-class trajectory data, and the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) method is applied to measure the error between the reconstructed trajectory and the original trajectory in order to judge whether the ship trajectory is abnormal. The Automatic Identification System (AIS) data from the US coastal areas are used to verify the proposed model, and the results are compared with other commonly used models in a manually labeled dataset. The research results indicate that the detection rate of the proposed model is 91.26%, and the false alarm rate is 0.68%, which performs the best. Using the Gaussian mixture model to describe the distribution of hidden space can improve the learning ability of multi-class trajectories of VAE, thus increasing the robustness of the model.

To improve the quality of vessel trajectories for further researches, a two-step calculation method for vessel trajectory reconstruction is proposed in this work. In particular, the Random Forest method is introduced in the first step to automatically identify the missing position records within vessel trajectories. The missing data points could be accurately estimated from both theoretical and practical perspectives. The second step proposes a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based supervised learning method to reconstruct the vessel trajectories with missing AIS data. The LSTM-based reconstruction method is able to take full advantage of the similar geometrical features behind massive vessel trajectories.

Specifically, the prediction of a vessel position is useful to provide alerts about upcoming events (e.g., opportunities and threats). However, accurate prediction along a route in the maritime domain is a challenging task, due to the complex and dynamic nature of traffic patterns. This paper presents a vessel prediction method, based on the popular Ornstein-Uhlenbeck stochastic processes, whose parameters are estimated from historical patterns of life. The historical traffic routes are obtained by pre-processing Automatic Identification System (AIS) data via the CMRE tool called Traffic Route Extraction for Anomaly Detection (TREAD). These recurrent routes allow prediction of the position of a vessel that is following one of these routes, surprisingly, by several hours. The method is validated using a case study related to the second data campaign of the EC FP7 Project New Service Capabilities for Integrated and Advanced Maritime Surveillance (NEREIDS)1.

"Potential impact of long-life environmental sonobuoys on littoral ASW","D. R. DelBalzo; J.

Consequently, supportive Naval maritime operations have continued to evolve toward littoral warfare in complicated shallow-water, near-shore environments. This evolution requires new sensors, advanced Concept of Operations, and improved data-analysis capabilities, among others. Planning operations in these harsh-environment areas is difficult because accurate predictions of tactical sensor performance depend on detailed knowledge of the local environmental conditions. Tactical mission planning is thus seldom optimal or efficient, often resulting in coverage gaps, increased risk, and reduced mission success. According to a Navy Mission Need Statement, ""Air ASW tactical execution, especially in littoral seas, requires in-situ environmental updates for preflight mission planning. In the conduct of ASW operations, an urgent need for explicit knowledge of environmental variables is required to optimize the effectiveness of operational acoustic sensors, as well as acoustic sensors in development "" The Naval Air Systems Command has considered extended-life environmental sonobuoy concepts to better characterize the littoral environment. Most designs contain a thermistor string to measure ocean temperatures and also hydrophones to measure ambient noise. This type of complex sonobuoy would be more expensive than a traditional single-measurement AXBT but it could provide a more thorough littoral environment assessment. This paper examines the trade-off between increased sensor complexity and improved ASW performance, in terms of cumulative detection probability. Some advantages of an extended-life combined thermistor string/hydrophone approach, compared to AXBTs and tactical hydrophones, are: 1) higher accuracy of the raw data; 2) temporal averaging to smooth out fluctuations; 3) extended area coverage during drift; 4) less chance for surface temperature anomalies (e.g., mixed-layer-depth errors) caused by various electronic and mechanical variability upon impact; 5) opportunities to discover thermal and acoustic feature boundaries during drift; and 6) less need to re-seed thus allowing longer tactical mission times. These advantages are evaluated relative to the following disadvantages: 1) increased cost; 2) potential drift outside the mission area; and 3) need for increased battery life for longer durations. The analysis is tempered by considering how a potential new system might be used. One assumption is that an environmental sampling decision aid is available to determine the minimum number and best initial locations of drifting sensors to meet performance objectives. The November 2007 Requirements Document from the Naval Oceanographic Office states ?Sampling guidance: Development of guidance on the best way to deploy, spatially and temporally, observation systems in order to meet various forecasting, model assimilation, and model evaluation objectives is needed.? Work in this area is reported in this Oceans '09 Conference in a paper entitled ?Uncertainty-based Adaptive AXBT Sampling with SPOTS?, which addresses optimal sampling requirements. For this trade-off analysis, temperature data from watersampling flights in the Sea of Japan off the east coast of Korea were used to simulate expected capability of a long-term drifting thermistor string. Then optimal initial positions for three notional buoys were determined followed by a simulation of drifting positions and data collected over 12 days. Ocean nowcasts were constructed and used to determine acoustic performance of a notional tactical sonobuoy field. The analysis shows that a drifting extended-life thermistor string can provide significant improvement in environmental characterization, tactical planning, and ASW detection performance.","0197-7385","978-1-4244-4960-6","10.23919/OCEANS.2009.5422145","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5422145","","Thermistors;Ocean temperature;Sampling methods;Sonar equipment;Acoustic sensors;Acoustic measurements;Sea measurements;Noise measurement;Predictive models;Temperature measurement","military systems","long-life environmental sonobuoys;littoral ASW;operational acoustic sensors","","","","","","1 Mar 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Based on a dynamic model described by Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) stochastic processes, the anomaly is represented by a target (e.g., a marine vessel) that deviates from a preset route by changing its nominal mean velocity. The Random Finite Set (RFS) framework is used to represent the switching nature of target's anomalous behavior in the presence of spurious measurements and detection uncertainty. Combining these two ingredients, the problem of jointly detecting target's path deviations and estimating its kinematic state can be formulated within the Bayesian framework, and analytically solved by means of a hybrid Bernoulli filter that sequentially updates the joint posterior density of the unknown OU velocity input (a Bernoulli RFS) and of the target's state random vector. We illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed filter, implemented in Gaussian-mixture form, in a simulated scenario of vessel tracking for maritime traffic monitoring.","","978-0-9964527-6-2","10.23919/ICIF.2018.8455567","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8455567","","Radio frequency;Artificial intelligence;Target tracking;Surveillance;Stochastic processes;Anomaly detection;Sea measurements","filtering theory;Gaussian processes;object detection;stochastic processes;target tracking","marine vessel;nominal mean velocity;Random Finite Set framework;switching nature;Bayesian framework;hybrid Bernoulli filter;joint posterior density;unknown OU velocity input;state random vector;vessel tracking;hybrid Bernoulli filtering;anomalous path deviations;sequential joint anomaly detection;stochastic processes","","11","","25","","6 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this context, data-driven prognostics and health management (PHM) systems have emerged as the optimal way to improve operational reliability and system safety. However, further research is needed to enhance the essential actions relating to such a system. Fault detection is the first and most crucial action of any data-driven PHM system. In this article, we propose a fault-type independent spectral anomaly detection algorithm for marine diesel engine degradation in autonomous ferries. The benefits of the algorithm are verified on three fault types where the nature of degradation differs. Both normal operation data and faulty degradation data have been collected from a marine diesel engine using two different engine load profiles. These profiles aim to replicate real autonomous ferry crossing operations, environmental conditions that the ferry may encounter. First, the data are subjected to a feature selection process to remove irrelevant and redundant features. Then, a multiregime normalization method is performed on the data to merge the engine loads into one context. Finally, a variational autoencoder is trained to estimate velocity and acceleration calculations of the anomaly score. Generic and dynamic threshold limits are simultaneously established to detect the fault time step online. The algorithm achieved an accuracy of 97.66% in the final test when the acceleration was used as the fault detector. The results suggest that the algorithm is independent of fault types with different nature of degradation related to the marine diesel engine.","1557-9662","","10.1109/TIM.2020.2994012","Department of Ocean Operations and Civil Engineering, Norwegian University of Science and Technology(grant numbers:90329106); Digital Twins for Vessel Life Cycle Service and the Research Council of Norway(grant numbers:280703); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9097190","Autonomous ferry;marine diesel engine;multiregime normalization;online fault detection;prognostics and health management (PHM)","Fault detection;Degradation;Anomaly detection;Heuristic algorithms;Prognostics and health management;Diesel engines;Acceleration","condition monitoring;data analysis;diesel engines;failure analysis;fault diagnosis;feature selection;marine systems;mechanical engineering computing;neural nets;reliability;ships","online fault detection;ship autonomy;maritime industry;operational reliability;data-driven PHM system;fault-type independent spectral anomaly detection algorithm;marine diesel engine degradation;faulty degradation data;autonomous ferry crossing operations;engine loads;fault detector;prognostics and health management system;system safety;environmental conditions;feature selection process;multiregime normalization method;variational autoencoder;velocity calculation;acceleration calculation;dynamic threshold limit;generic threshold limit","","11","","25","CCBY","20 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Our learning algorithms learn behavioral patterns at a variety of conceptual, spatial, and temporal levels to reduce a massive amount of track data to a rich set of information regarding their field of regard that supports decision-making and timely response initiation. Continuous incremental learning enables the models of normal behavior to adapt well to evolving situations while maintaining high levels of performance.

Unfortunately, satellite AIS deals with so-called packet collision effect: since there is a problem with synchronizing AIS data coming from multiple terrestrial areas, a single satellite may receive several AIS messages at the same time and be unable to correctly process them, causing the data to get lost or garbled. In this article, a machine learning based framework for detecting the incorrect AIS data is presented.

The proposed method employs contextual information to check the logical consistency of the curvilinear method and then, constructs a Context-aware Long Short-Term Memory (CLSTM) network that can take into account contextual variables, such as the vessel types. The proposed method can enhance the prediction accuracy while maintaining the logical consistency, through a recursive feedback loop.

We present two case studies to emphasize the characteristics of the proposed algorithm: 1) a fault classification problem in an automotive system and 2) an anomaly detection problem in the maritime environment.","","978-3-9524-2698-2","10.23919/ECC.2018.8550271","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8550271","","Decision trees;Impurities;Binary trees;Complexity theory;Machine learning;Task analysis;Prediction algorithms","inference mechanisms;learning (artificial intelligence);signal classification;temporal logic;trees (mathematics)","temporal logic properties;fault classification problem;online supervised learning problem;binary tree;STL;maritime environment;anomaly detection problem;automotive system;signal classification;temporal logic formulae;formula complexity;incremental construction;signal temporal logic formula;online inference","","6","","12","","29 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

PEARL drifters are small, rugged, low-cost, autonomous, environmentally friendly ocean drifters that represent a significant opportunity for high-impact applications in both national security and environmental ecosystem monitoring. Drifters record and report data which is processed by advanced edge analytics before being compressed for satellite transmission to populate a large data repository with sensor data that is combined and analyzed to discover signals of interest in the ocean environment with the goal of increasing distributed maritime awareness. Each drifter is entirely self-contained, powered by solar panels and backup batteries, with a large array of sensors, compute module for onboard data processing, and satellite modem for data reporting. The drifter architecture is flexible and can be customized for a specific purpose. The complete data record is stored locally and processed by the onboard compute module, which runs anomaly detection algorithms that detect nearby activity. Anomalous events, as well as baseline environmental data, are reported to a cloud database using satellite short burst data transmission. Though each independent drifter is a powerful sensing tool, the low unit cost permits large scale deployment. To date thousands of drifters have been deployed over vast areas of the ocean and are reporting data to a remote database where cloud-based analytics algorithms develop global situational awareness and update local edge algorithms on the drifters based on learnings across the full network.","0197-7385","978-1-6654-6809-1","10.1109/OCEANS47191.2022.9977209","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9977209","lagrangian drifter;edge processing;anomaly detection;environmental data;cloud-edge algorithms;data reduction;ocean circulation;maritime domain awareness;vessel tracking","Cloud computing;Satellites;Oceans;Roads;Distributed databases;Turning;Sensors","cloud computing;geophysics computing;marine systems;national security;oceanographic equipment;oceanographic regions;oceanographic techniques;remote sensing;satellite communication","advanced edge analytics;baseline environmental data;complete data record;data reporting;data repository;distributed ocean observation;drifter architecture;environmental ecosystem monitoring;environmentally friendly ocean drifters;high-impact applications;intelligent drifter fleet;Location ocean drifters;maritime awareness;ocean environment;onboard compute module;onboard data processing;PEARL drifters;Persistent Environmental Awareness Reporting;satellite modem;satellite short burst data transmission;satellite transmission;sensor data","","1","","17","IEEE","19 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The field of maritime robotics is swiftly moving toward integration of air, surface, and subsurface autonomous systems. For example, where autonomous maritime systems (AMS) are composed of heterogeneous assets, surface vehicles are now often capable of transporting aerial and underwater vehicles, leveraging the benefits of each to increase mission endurance and capabilities. In seeking to integrate land, sea, and air vehicle systems, it is natural to look toward leveraging advances made separately in each domain. For example, substantial similarities exist between the desired behavioral capabilities of autonomous land vehicles and those of autonomous marine systems. Recent advances in the field of driverless cars may therefore be applicable to autonomous surface vessels, underwater vehicles, and even aerial vehicles.","1558-1691","","10.1109/JOE.2019.2899541","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8691636","","Special issues and sections;Maritime technology;Service robots;Robot sensing systems;Underwater vehicles;Autonomous vehicles","","","","","","0","IEEE","14 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Traditionally, maritime communication services are provided mostly by maritime satellites. In some places, shore and island-based base stations (BSs) can also be built to extend the coverage of terrestrial networks, providing the fourth-generation (4G) or even the fifth-generation (5G) services. To further build up communication networks over the ocean for better coverage, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)-aided and ship-borne BSs can be exploited to serve as supplementary relaying nodes. Despite all these approaches, there are still open issues towards the establishment of an agile maritime communication network (MCN). The goal of this feature topic is to present the stateof- the-art original research, and the latest advances and innovations in key theories, technologies, and innovative applications for agile MCNs, and further identify emerging research topics and future research directions.","1673-5447","","10.23919/JCC.2020.9058600","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9058600","","Special issues and sections;Communication networks;Sea surfaces;Noise reduction;Wireless sensor networks;Maritime communications","","","","","","","","7 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

The study is based on real sensor data streamed from a ship to shore, where the data is analysed through a big data analytics platform. The novelty of this work originates in the use of data from sensors covering different aspects of the ship operation, exemplified here by propulsion power, speed over ground and ship motion in four different degrees of freedom. The developed method employs Auto Associative Kernel Regression (AAKR) for signal reconstruction, and the Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT) technique for anomaly detection, where different hypothesis tests looking both at mean and variance deviations have been tested. In order to compare different settings, formal state of the art performance metrics have been used. We demonstrate that the AAKR model produces good reconstructions when the observations are similar to observations represented in the training data, and for some examples of simulated anomalies, the method reveals the abnormal behaviour. As long as the parameters are tuned carefully, alarms are triggered appropriately by the SPRT.","","978-1-5090-0382-2","10.1109/ICPHM.2016.7754713","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7754713","","","","","","","","","IEEE","24 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
