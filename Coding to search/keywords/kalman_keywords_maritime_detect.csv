"real-time multi-object tracking using adaptive filtering and filter banks for maritime applications","2021","This paper presents a novel approach to Multi-Object-Tracking (MOT), which solves the well-known problem of maritime surveillance. We use exteroceptive sensors, such as LiDAR, and Automatic Identification System (AIS), to measure the surroundingsâ€™ Vessels. These objects are associated using evidence theory. Afterward, the proposed algorithm tracks all the objects using a new concept: each object is tracked with a respective filter bank consisting of three Adaptive Extended Kalman Filters (AEKF) as subfilters. These have the same prediction model but different correction algorithms based on various measurement sources. The covariance noise matrices are adapted based on the current measurement quality. The filter banks can overcome drawbacks such as wrong and incomplete measurements, thus improving tracking performance.We have validated the algorithm in real-world scenarios in Rostock Harbor, Germany. The proposed algorithm can track all the objects within the view simultaneously in real-time. By comparing with a reference vessel, the mean 2D position error is ca. 2 m, which is much smaller than the AIS-only solution (5 to 10 m). During the test drive, the filter bank can detect and compensate for incorrect information, such as biased AIS positioning or incomplete LiDAR measurements, to guarantee robust positioning.","covariance matrices,Kalman filters,measurement sources,signal denoising,Prediction algorithms,channel bank filters,respective filter bank,Laser radar,time multiobject tracking,Adaptive Extended Kalman Filters,MultiObject-Tracking,Filter banks,object tracking,Evidence theory,Automatic Identification System,filtering theory,maritime surveillance,Weight measurement,nonlinear filters,maritime applications,Real-time systems,adaptive filtering,size 5.0 m to 10.0 m,wrong measurements,different correction algorithms,tracking performance,Current measurement,geophysical signal processing,current measurement quality,incomplete measurements,size 2.0 m,adaptive filters,oceanographic techniques,"
"video stabilizing and tracking by horizontal line for maritime cruise ship","2007","It is a key technique to carry out video Stabilizing and object tracking in the Held of marine supervision. This method is based on the new requirements of maritime law enforcement ship. Firstly, It resolve the detection of horizontal line with wavelet transformation. Then, by the combination of horizontal line, image transformations and video platform's feedback, a algorithm of dual compensatory video stabilizing (DCVS) is carried out. Synchronously, with the ubiety of truncation-center and global coordinate system, Kalman filter is used to carry on estimating Truncation-center to finished truncation tracking (TT) of video object. Because it make full use of hydraulic parameters of horizontal line to achieve video stabilizing and tracking, the technique performs well.","Kalman filter,video stabilization,Optical devices,wavelet transformation,Marine vehicles,global coordinate system,Character recognition,horizontal line,maritime cruise ship,Law enforcement,ships,video stabilizing,marine engineering,Target tracking,Image recognition,video tracking,maritime law enforcement ship,wavelet transforms,video signal processing,moving-object tracking,marine supervision,Frequency,Automation,Automatic control,Videoconference,dual compensatory video stabilizing,tracking,"
"obstacle avoidance and target search of an autonomous surface vehicle for 2016 maritime robotx challenge","2017","This paper describes algorithms for Autonomous Surface Vehicle(ASV) obstacle avoidance and target search task. This work is primarily designed for task mission of 2016 Maritime RobotX competition. In this task, ASV must avoid obstacle buoys, while it is searching for totem-shaped buoy. To deal with such problem, algorithms for both perception and motion planning stage was designed. In perception stage, 2D scanning LIDAR and monocular vision sensor are used to detect any floating objects on the water. To recognize target (totem buoy), HSV color space information was used. Detected object (both obstacle and totem buoy) information is tracked by using Kalman filter. In action planning stage, both deliberative and reflexive action [2] planning are designed. In deliberative action planning stage, based on the Kalman filter tracked obstacle information, a grid map can be generated. Using the grid map and A* search algorithm, desired path for searching totem can be calculated. In reflexive action planning stage, once ASV accidently enters hazardous region, where it has high probability of getting collide, it is designed to reflexively escape the region by making pure sway motion. An ASV experiment was performed to validate proposed method.","deliberative action planning stage,A* search algorithm,Kalman filter,Kalman filters,task mission,totem buoy recognition,remotely operated vehicles,perception stage,robot vision,2016 Maritime RobotX competition,2D scanning LIDAR,floating object detection,Planning,target search,monocular vision sensor,Laser radar,Image color analysis,image colour analysis,grid map,totem-shaped buoy,reflexive action planning stage,object tracking,autonomous surface vehicle,Collision avoidance,Target tracking,object detection,motion planning stage,Robots,optical radar,graph theory,obstacle buoy avoidance,search problems,ASV,probability,mobile robots,image sensors,marine vehicles,collision avoidance,HSV color space information,target recognition,object recognition,"
"a multitarget range-azimuth tracker for maritime applications","2013","In this paper, we focus on the design of a Kalman filter-based algorithm to track multiple targets in range and azimuth. The detection stage implements a multitarget strategy and is aimed at collecting and eventually processing all target components (i.e., in range and azimuth).

"a cnn-lstm network for augmenting target detection in real maritime wide area surveillance radar data","2020","Typical radar detectors exploit only a small proportion of the valuable information contained in radar reflections, i.e. magnitude and Doppler. A neural network-based approach for augmenting traditional radar detector structures using machine learning (ML) is proposed in this paper. Specifically, the network is designed to augment target detection in the field of maritime wide area surveillance for non-coherent data. A combination network consisting of a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract spatial features and a long short-term memory (LSTM) for extracting temporal patterns in the spatial features is proposed. The network augments the detector structure by blanking out regions of the frame which are classified as not containing a target, thus reducing false alarms. The network is tested on data containing four marine targets collected by a ground-based radar. The data set was chosen because it contains strong sea clutter returns. When ML is used, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves are shifted to lower probability of false alarm (PFA). A Kalman filter tracker was applied to the ML-augmented and baseline detections, and it was shown that ML-augmented detections produced similar tracks at lower PFA. The feature discovering capability of the network is analyzed through a series of tests, and the argument is made that the CNN-LSTM network presented in this work demonstrates the ability to improve the detection performance by exploiting spatial and temporal information in the data.","real maritime wide area surveillance radar data,detector structure,Kalman filters,marine radar,baseline detections,radar detection,radar clutter,CNN-LSTM network,Feature extraction,ML-augmented detections,LSTM,target detection augmentation,neural nets,target tracking,short-term memory,wide area surveillance radar,Artificial neural networks,CNN,noncoherent data,maritime surveillance,object detection,feature extraction,combination network,search radar,data set,radar imaging,convolutional neural network,detection performance,ground-based radar,neural network-based approach,radar detectors,radar tracking,radar reflections,temporal information,marine targets,probability,Clutter,Object detection,false alarm,traditional radar detector structures,learning (artificial intelligence),spatial features,Detectors,Radar detection,spatial information,"
"maritime traffic monitoring based on vessel detection, tracking, state estimation, and trajectory prediction","2012","Maneuvering vessel detection and tracking (VDT), incorporated with state estimation and trajectory prediction, are important tasks for vessel navigational systems (VNSs), as well as vessel traffic monitoring and information systems (VTMISs) to improve maritime safety and security in ocean navigation. Although conventional VNSs and VTMISs are equipped with maritime surveillance systems for the same purpose, intelligent capabilities for vessel detection, tracking, state estimation, and navigational trajectory prediction are underdeveloped. Therefore, the integration of intelligent features into VTMISs is proposed in this paper. The first part of this paper is focused on detecting and tracking of a multiple-vessel situation. An artificial neural network (ANN) is proposed as the mechanism for detecting and tracking multiple vessels. In the second part of this paper, vessel state estimation and navigational trajectory prediction of a single-vessel situation are considered.

"impact of measurement model mismatch on nonlinear track-before-detect performance for maritime radar surveillance","2011","In this paper, the application of track-before-detect (TkBD) processing against airborne radar surveillance data is examined. The sensitivity of TkBD processing to the choice of clutter model was examined through processing of real and simulated data containing noncoherent radar echo amplitude returns of a small maritime target in sea clutter. The utilization of K- and KA-distributed clutter models in place of the simpler Rayleigh distribution was examined through analysis of simulated and real data. Significant shortcomings were identified.

"saliency-based detection for maritime object tracking","2016","This paper presents a new method for object detection and tracking based on visual saliency as a way of mitigating against challenges present in maritime environments. Object detection is based on adaptive hysteresis thresholding of a saliency map generated with a modified version of the Boolean Map Saliency (BMS) approach. We show that the modification reduces false positives by suppressing detection of wakes and surface glint. Tracking is performed by matching detections frame to frame and smoothing trajectories with a Kalman filter.

"detection of ais messages falsifications and spoofing by checking messages compliance with tdma protocol","2023","Automatic identification system is a navigation aid system that allows vessels to exchange automatically positions, identity and other information. It improves the safety of the maritime traffic and helps to monitor it. However, this system can be manipulated to send falsified information and to mask illicit activities. While previous research has proposed strategies to detect these threats, none of them suggest a solution that considers the time-division multiple access (TDMA) communication protocol. In this work, the compliance of the sent messages with this protocol, specified by the system's standard, is checked for every ship to detect message falsifications. Furthermore, because the ships velocity affects TDMA protocol, a strategy based a Kalman filter is applied to track every ship and to assess the consistency of their velocity data sent. The proposed strategy was validated on real data and showed very promising results. Being computationally cheap, the method can be run in real time. Source codes of the method are open-source to foster research activities from both industry and academia in this field.","Automatic Identification System (AIS),Spoofing detection,TDMA protocol,Falsifications detection,Kalman filtering,"
"deeptracks: geopositioning maritime vehicles in video acquired from a moving platform","2021","Geopositioning and tracking a moving boat at sea is a very challenging problem, requiring boat detection, matching and estimating its GPS location from imagery with no common features. The problem can be stated as follows: given imagery from a camera mounted on a moving platform with known GPS location as the only valid sensor, we predict the geoposition of a target boat visible in images. Our solution uses recent ML algorithms, the camera-scene geometry and Bayesian filtering. The proposed pipeline first detects and tracks the target boatâ€™s location in the image with the strategy of tracking by detection. This image location is then converted to geoposition to the local sea coordinates referenced to the camera GPS location using plane projective geometry. Finally, target boat local coordinates are transformed to global GPS coordinates to estimate the geoposition. To achieve a smooth geotrajectory, we apply unscented Kalman filter (UKF) which implicitly overcomes small detection errors in the early stages of the pipeline. We tested the performance of our approach using GPS ground truth and show the accuracy and speed of the estimated geopositions. The source code will be made public once the paper is accepted.","Pipelines,DeepTracks,Kalman filters,Object Tracking by Detection,geoposition,Prediction algorithms,global GPS,Bayes methods,Cameras,Bayesian filtering,camera GPS location,pipeline,maritime vehicle geopositioning,Global Positioning System,image location,Unscented Kalman Filter,UKF,Filtering,camera-scene geometry,boats,unscented Kalman filter,Target tracking,cameras,object detection,video signal processing,moving platform,boat detection,marine engineering computing,GPS ground truth,plane projective geometry,local sea coordinates,Plane Projective Geometry,Boats,Geopositioning,GPS location,moving boat,ML algorithms,Deep Learning,target boat local coordinates,"
"psr-based feature adaptation with anomaly re-prediction for maritime target tracking","2022","The tracking method for the relevant filter cannot track when the target is affected by the background and in the scene of occlusion. We propose a target tracking algorithm based on the peak-to-sidelobe ratio (PSR) feature weight adaptation with anomaly re-detection based on the efficient convolution operator for manual features (ECO_HC) algorithm. The weights of the HOG features and CN features corresponding to the peak-to-sidelobe ratio are used as dynamic weight coefficients, and the maximum response value after their fusion is the area where the target may appear. Determine the target tracking status by calculating the tracking confidence of the response map, and when there is a tracking anomaly, the ECO_HC tracker is enhanced using the Kalman filter to re-predict the target position. The proposed algorithm has experimented on the OTB-50 dataset. The results show that our algorithm can cope with complex scenarios and improves by 3.0% in tracking accuracy and 2.8% in tracking success rate compared with the baseline algorithm ECO_HC. Finally, conduct tracking experiments on the actual sea surface scenes, and the proposed algorithm effectively suppresses the effects of common interference factors on the tracking effect.","response map,anomaly re-detection,tracking success rate,baseline algorithm ECO_HC,Kalman filter,Kalman filters,tracking anomaly,Prediction algorithms,target tracking status,PSR-based feature adaptation,dynamic weight coefficients,tracking confidence,maximum response value,ECO_HC tracker,tracking effect,Filtering algorithms,Filtering,feature dynamic fusion,target tracking,actual sea surface scenes,efficient convolution operator,object tracking,HOG features,manual features algorithm,relevant filter,target position,Target tracking,correlation filter,feature extraction,tracking method,Sea surface,target tracking algorithm,weight adaptation,anomaly prediction,CN features,Anomaly Re-Prediction,Interference,maritime target tracking,Heuristic algorithms,peak-to-sidelobe ratio,"
"ship trajectory prediction based on machine learning and deep learning: a systematic review and methods analysis","2023","Ship trajectory prediction based on Automatic Identification System (AIS) data has attracted increasing interest as it helps prevent collision accidents and eliminate potential navigational conflicts. Therefore, it is necessary and urgent to conduct a systematic analysis of all the prediction methods to help reveal their advantages to ensure safety at sea in different scenarios. It is particularly important and significant within the context of unmanned ships forming a new hybrid maritime traffic together with manned ships in the future. This paper aims to conduct a comparative analysis of the up-to-date ship trajectory prediction algorithms based on machine learning and deep learning methods. To do so, five classical machine learning methods (i.e., Kalman Filter, Gaussian Process Regression, Support Vector Regression, Random Forest, and Back Propagation Network) and eight deep learning methods (i.e., Recurrent Neural Networks, Long Short-Term Memory, Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory, Gate Recurrent Unit, Bi-directional Gate Recurrent Unit, Sequence to Sequence, Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network, and Transformer) are thoroughly analysed and compared from the algorithm essence and applications to excavate their features and adaptability for manned and unmanned ships. The findings reveal the characteristics of various prediction methods and provide valuable implications for different stakeholders to guide the best-fit choice of a particular method as the solution under a specific circumstance. It also makes contributions to the extraction of the research difficulties of ship trajectory prediction and the corresponding solutions that are put forward to guide the development of future research.","Deep learning,Maritime safety,Hybrid maritime traffic,Trajectory prediction,AIS data,Machine learning,"
"maritime environment perception based on deep learning","2022","Environment perception is an essential aspect of automated maritime vehicles, especially in high-traffic areas. In recent years, deep-learning-based object detection using LiDAR has been well developed in the automotive sector but has not yet seen a similar level of sophisticated development in maritime applications. In these applications, LiDAR detection should be fused with other maritime navigation systems such as the automatic identification system (AIS) to expand the detection range. To address this, we propose a novel deep-learning-based concept for maritime environment perception by using LiDAR as a primary sensor and AIS as an assisting information source. This approach consists of three functional modules: object detection, multi-object tracking, and static environment mapping. For object detection, we apply a convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect floating objects represented as oriented bounding boxes. To train the CNN, we propose a method that generates simulated labeled datasets. The detected objects from CNN are tracked with Kalman Filter banks. The remaining LiDAR data points are treated as static environments and represented by polygons. We evaluated the approach by using simulative and real-world datasets. In the simulation, the average precision of the CNN object detector reaches 60.8%, with a data processing rate of 40 Hz in GPU. Our real-world evaluations show that this approach can track 83% of the vessels in a crowded harbor, with the overall intersection over union reaching 64%. Our proposed approach represents the first application of CNN for LiDAR-based maritime environment perception, demonstrating its high potential for future online and real-world applications.","high-traffic areas,real-world applications,static environment mapping,Kalman filters,CNN object detector,automated maritime vehicles,deep-learning-based concept,static environments,Laser radar,neural nets,frequency 40.0 Hz,deep learning,object tracking,automatic identification system,LiDAR detection,Intelligent vessels,supervised learning,maritime navigation,AIS,object detection,sophisticated development,image classification,Radar tracking,Artificial intelligence,convolutional neural network,optical radar,Point cloud compression,Radar,maritime applications,maritime navigation systems,detection range,LiDAR-based maritime environment perception,multi-object tracking,Object detection,deep-learning-based object detection,multiobject tracking,learning (artificial intelligence),remaining LiDAR data points,Detectors,"
"a data processing method of maritime surveillance radar on mechanical and electronical scanning mode","2020","The maritime surveillance radar is prone to have the problems of false track initiation and tracking loss due to the low tracking accuracy of the target using the traditional data processing strategy. To solve these problems, a data processing strategy is proposed based on a mechanical and electronical scanned radar. As the problem of velocity ambiguity is caused by far detection distance and low pulse repetition frequency (PRF), the overlapping algorithm is used and the corresponding constraints are employed for optimization. The problem of too many false tracks as a result of background noise is solved by using Hough transform and logic-based algorithm optimized under the relevant constraints. In addition, an optimization method of Kalman filtering is proposed based on the predicted value of the stable course of maritime targets to solve track jitter. The results of experiment show that this strategy is effective and improves the accuracy of radar in locating and tracking targets.","false tracks,electronical scanned radar,Kalman filters,marine radar,mechanical scanning mode,logic-based algorithm,radar detection,low pulse repetition frequency,target tracking,data processing method,false track initiation,tracking loss,track jitter,mechanical scanned radar,Kalman filtering,Hough transforms,object detection,optimisation,maritime targets,search radar,jitter,velocity ambiguity,overlapping algorithm,radar tracking,maritime surveillance radar,Hough transform,data processing strategy,electronical scanning mode,"
"analysis of local observability for feature localization in a maritime environment using an omnidirectional camera","2007","Autonomous operation by a surface vehicle in a maritime setting requires that the surface vehicle detects non-water objects, including shoreline, hazards to navigation, and other moving vessels. In order to assess the utility of an omnidirectional camera for detecting and localizing non- water objects, we rigorously investigate observability of both stationary and moving features.

"ais data-driven ship trajectory prediction modelling and analysis based on machine learning and deep learning methods","2023","Maritime transport faces new safety challenges in an increasingly complex traffic environment caused by large-scale and high-speed ships, particularly with the introduction of intelligent and autonomous ships. It is evident that Automatic Identification System (AIS) data-driven ship trajectory prediction can effectively aid in identifying abnormal ship behaviours and reducing maritime risks such as collision, stranding, and contact. Furthermore, trajectory prediction is widely recognised as one of the critical technologies for realising safe autonomous navigation. The prediction methods and their performance are the key factors for future safe and automatic shipping. Currently, ship trajectory prediction lacks the real performance measurement and analysis of different algorithms, including classical machine learning and emerging deep learning methods. This paper aims to systematically analyse the performance of ship trajectory prediction methods and pioneer experimental tests to reveal their advantages and disadvantages as well as fitness in different scenarios involving complicated systems. To do so, five machine learning methods (i.e., Kalman Filter (KF), Support Vector Progression (SVR), Back Propagation network (BP), Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), and Random Forest (RF)) and seven deep learning methods (i.e., Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gate Recurrent Unit (GRU), Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM), Sequence to Sequence (Seq2seq), Bi-directional Gate Recurrent Unit (Bi-GRU), and Transformer) are first extracted from the state-of-the-art literature review and then employed to implement the trajectory prediction and compare their prediction performance in the real world. Three AIS datasets are collected from the waters of representative traffic features, including a normal channel (i.e., the Chengshan Jiao Promontory), complex traffic (i.e., the Zhoushan Archipelago), and a port area (i.e., Caofeidian port). They are selected to test and analyse the performance of all twelve methods based on six evaluation indexes and explore the characteristics and effectiveness of the twelve trajectory prediction methods in detail. The experimental results provide a novel perspective, comparison, and benchmark for ship trajectory prediction research, which not only demonstrates the fitness of each method in different maritime traffic scenarios, but also makes significant contributions to maritime safety and autonomous shipping development.","Deep learning,Maritime safety,Trajectory prediction,AIS data,Machine learning,"
"application of the jpda-ukf to hfsw radars for maritime situational awareness","2012","At the present day, growing interest is paid to the development of more reliable surveillance systems for maritime situational awareness (MSA). The purpose is to detect, track and classify cooperative and non-cooperative targets. For this reason, great interest is given to low-power/cost High-Frequency Surface-Wave (HFSW) radars as an early-warning tool for over-the-horizon (OTH) applications. However, in HFSW radars there is a trade-off in terms of quality and cost, i.e. the radar system exhibits poor azimuth resolution, high non-linearity, and significant false alarm rate. All these aspects reduce tracking performance if not properly addressed. In this context, the Joint Probabilistic Data Association (JPDA) with the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) is proposed. The tracking algorithm behavior is investigated by a comparison between the tracks generated by two HFSW radars, with overlapped fields of view, and Automatic Identification System (AIS) data.
