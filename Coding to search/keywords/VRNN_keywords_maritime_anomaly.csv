"geotracknetâ€”a maritime anomaly detector using probabilistic neural network representation of ais tracks and a contrario detection","2022","Representing maritime traffic patterns and detecting anomalies from them are key to vessel monitoring and maritime situational awareness. We propose a novel approachâ€”referred to as GeoTrackNetâ€”for maritime anomaly detection from AIS data streams. Our model exploits state-of-the-art neural network schemes to learn a probabilistic representation of AIS tracks and a contrario detection to detect abnormal events. The neural network provides a new means to capture complex and heterogeneous patterns in vesselsâ€™ behaviours, while the a contrario detector takes into account the fact that the learnt distribution may be location-dependent. Experiments on a real AIS dataset comprising more than 4.2 million AIS messages demonstrate the relevance of the proposed method compared with state-of-the-art schemes.","heterogeneous patterns,motion estimation,GeoTrackNet,naval engineering computing,Anomaly detection,Geospatial analysis,anomaly detection,probabilistic representation,variational recurrent neural networks,AIS messages,maritime traffic patterns,maritime anomaly detector,AIS dataset,maritime situational awareness,neural nets,probabilistic neural network representation,deep learning,ships,marine engineering,AIS data streams,complex patterns,contrario detection,AIS,maritime surveillance,object detection,Probabilistic logic,a contrario detection,Artificial intelligence,maritime anomaly detection,Trajectory,Task analysis,vessel monitoring,contrario detector,learning (artificial intelligence),state-of-the-art neural network schemes,Detectors,AIS tracks,"
"a multi-task deep learning architecture for maritime surveillance using ais data streams","2018","In a world of global trading, maritime safety, security and efficiency are crucial issues. We propose a multi-task deep learning framework for vessel monitoring using Automatic Identification System (AIS) data streams. We combine recurrent neural networks with latent variable modeling and an embedding of AIS messages to a new representation space to jointly address key issues to be dealt with when considering AIS data streams: massive amount of streaming data, noisy data and irregular time-sampling. We demonstrate the relevance of the proposed deep learning framework on real AIS datasets for a three-task setting, namely trajectory reconstruction, anomaly detection and vessel type identification.","three-task setting,crucial issues,recurrent neural nets,representation space,anomaly detection,Recurrent neural networks,multitask deep learning framework,trajectory reconstruction,recurrent neural networks,considering AIS data streams,variational recurrent neural networks,AIS messages,vessel type identification,Noise measurement,latent variable modeling,noisy data,deep learning,data analysis,AIS,maritime surveillance,Data models,streaming data,automatic identification system data streams,AIS datasets,trans fer learning,Trajectory,Deep learning,Task analysis,multitask deep learning architecture,global trading,vessel monitoring,learning (artificial intelligence),maritime safety,"
