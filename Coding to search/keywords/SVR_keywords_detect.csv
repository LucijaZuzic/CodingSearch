"coastal water bathymetry for critical zone management using regression tree models from gaofen-6 imagery","2021","Coastal water depth information is fundamental to coast management and coastal critical zone development. The traditional bathymetric sounding method depends on radar or surveying vessels, which are expensive and time-consuming. Thus, it is of high importance to develop a rapidly updating water depth detection method. In order to bridge this gap, we explored the Chinese Gaofen-6 wide field of view (GF-6 WFV) visible-near infrared satellite imagery for large-scale accurate coastal bathymetric mapping and to understand the vertical water column environment with regression tree models. The predictors, including the Blue band/Violet band (BV), Green band/Violet band (GV), Yellow band/Violet band (YV), Green band (G), Yellow band (Y), and red-edge1 band (Re1), were derived via statistical analysis, as well as spectroscopy knowledge and experience. Compared with the conventional bathymetric method, such as single band algorithm (SBA), band ratio algorithm and support vector regression (SVR), the two regression trees used in this study yielded better accuracy. The R2, MAE and RMSE of the classification and regression tree (CART), the Cubist tree model were 0.74, 3.78 m and 5.35 m vs 0.78, 3.56 m and 4.88 m. Besides the improved accuracies, these tree-based models can effectively reveal water depth-associated environment types with the hierarchical relationships present in the visible spectral characteristics, which supports spatial zoning strategies for coastal critical zone management based on the Gaofen-6 imagery.","Bathymetry,Violet-related spectral ratio,Regression trees,SVR,Gaofen-6 satellite,Critical coastal zone management,"
"wind turbine high-speed shaft bearings health prognosis through a spectral kurtosis-derived indices and svr","2017","A significant number of failures of wind turbine drivetrains occur in the high-speed shaft bearings. In this paper, a vibration-based prognostic and health monitoring methodology for wind turbine high-speed shaft bearing (HSSB) is proposed using a spectral kurtosis (SK) data-driven approach. Indeed, time domain indices derived from SK are used and a comparative study is performed with frequently used time-domain features in the bearing degradation health assessment. The effectiveness is quantified by two measures, i.e., monotonicity and trendability. Among those features, the area under SK is utilized for the first time as a condition indicator of rolling bearing fault. A support vector regression (SVR) model was trained and tested for the prediction of the HSSB lifetime prognostics, showing the superiority of SK-derived indices of degradation assessment. We verified the potential of the prognostics method using real measured data from a drivetrain wind turbine. The experimental results show that the proposed approach can successfully detect an early failure and can better estimate the degradation trend of HSSB than traditional time-domain vibration features.","Fault prognosis,High speed shaft bearing,Kurtogram,Spectral kurtosis,Support vector regression,"
"ais data-driven ship trajectory prediction modelling and analysis based on machine learning and deep learning methods","2023","Maritime transport faces new safety challenges in an increasingly complex traffic environment caused by large-scale and high-speed ships, particularly with the introduction of intelligent and autonomous ships. It is evident that Automatic Identification System (AIS) data-driven ship trajectory prediction can effectively aid in identifying abnormal ship behaviours and reducing maritime risks such as collision, stranding, and contact. Furthermore, trajectory prediction is widely recognised as one of the critical technologies for realising safe autonomous navigation. The prediction methods and their performance are the key factors for future safe and automatic shipping. Currently, ship trajectory prediction lacks the real performance measurement and analysis of different algorithms, including classical machine learning and emerging deep learning methods. This paper aims to systematically analyse the performance of ship trajectory prediction methods and pioneer experimental tests to reveal their advantages and disadvantages as well as fitness in different scenarios involving complicated systems. To do so, five machine learning methods (i.e., Kalman Filter (KF), Support Vector Progression (SVR), Back Propagation network (BP), Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), and Random Forest (RF)) and seven deep learning methods (i.e., Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gate Recurrent Unit (GRU), Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM), Sequence to Sequence (Seq2seq), Bi-directional Gate Recurrent Unit (Bi-GRU), and Transformer) are first extracted from the state-of-the-art literature review and then employed to implement the trajectory prediction and compare their prediction performance in the real world. Three AIS datasets are collected from the waters of representative traffic features, including a normal channel (i.e., the Chengshan Jiao Promontory), complex traffic (i.e., the Zhoushan Archipelago), and a port area (i.e., Caofeidian port). They are selected to test and analyse the performance of all twelve methods based on six evaluation indexes and explore the characteristics and effectiveness of the twelve trajectory prediction methods in detail. The experimental results provide a novel perspective, comparison, and benchmark for ship trajectory prediction research, which not only demonstrates the fitness of each method in different maritime traffic scenarios, but also makes significant contributions to maritime safety and autonomous shipping development.","Deep learning,Maritime safety,Trajectory prediction,AIS data,Machine learning,"
"an iot based system for magnify air pollution monitoring and prognosis using hybrid artificial intelligence technique","2022","Air pollution is the existence of atmospheric chemicals damaging the health of human beings and other living organisms or damaging the environment or resources. Rarely any common contaminants are smog, nicotine, mold, yeast, biogas, or carbon dioxide. The paper will primarily observe, visualize and anticipate pollution levels. In particular, three algorithms of Artificial Intelligence were used to create good forecasting models and a predictive AQI model for 4 distinct gases: carbon dioxide, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, and atmospheric particulate matter. Thus, in this paper, the Air Qualification Index is developed utilizing Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression, and the Gradient Boosted Decision Tree GBDT Ensembles model over the next 5 h and analyzes air qualities using various sensors. The hypothesized artificial intelligence models are evaluated to the Root Mean Squares Error, Mean Squared Error and Mean absolute error, depending upon the performance measurements and a lower error value model is chosen. Based on the algorithm of the Artificial Intelligent System, the level of 5 air pollutants like CO2, SO2, NO2, PM 2.5 and PM10 can be predicted immediately by integrating the observations with errors. It may be used to detect air quality from distance in large cities and can assist lower the degree of environmental pollution.","Predicting system,Environment,Gradient boosted decision tree ensemble model,Support vector regression model,Artificial intelligence,Internet of thing,Air pollution,Linear regression model,Air quality,"
"hybrid approaches for container traffic forecasting in the context of anomalous events: the case of the yangtze river delta region in the covid-19 pandemic","2022","The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on container transportation. Accurate forecasting of container throughput is critical for policymakers and port authorities, especially in the context of the anomalous events of the COVID-19 pandemic. In this paper, we firstly proposed hybrid models for univariate time series forecasting to enhance prediction accuracy while eliminating the nonlinearity and multivariate limitations. Next, we compared the forecasting accuracy of different models with various training dataset extensions and forecasting horizons. Finally, we analysed the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on container throughput forecasting and container transportation. An empirical analysis of container throughputs in the Yangtze River Delta region was performed for illustration and verification purposes. Error metrics analysis suggests that SARIMA-LSTM2 and SARIMA-SVR2 (configuration 2) have the best performance compared to other models and they can better predict the container traffic in the context of anomalous events such as the COVID-19 pandemic. The results also reveal that, with an increase in the training dataset extensions, the accuracy of the models is improved, particularly in comparison with standard statistical models (i.e. SARIMA model). An accurate prediction can help strategic management and policymakers to better respond to the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.","SARIMA model,COVID-19 pandemic,Hybrid model,Machine learning model,Yangtze River Delta multi-port region,"
"condition based maintenance in railway transportation systems based on big data streaming analysis","2015","Streaming Data Analysis (SDA) of Big Data Streams (BDS) for Condition Based Maintenance (CBM) in the context of Rail Transportation Systems (RTS) is a state-of-the-art field of re- search. SDA of BDS is the problem of analyzing, modeling and extracting information from huge amounts of data that continuously come from several sources in real time through com- putational aware solutions. Among others, CBM for Rail Transportation is one of the most challenging SDA problems, consisting of the implementation of a predictive maintenance system for evaluating the future status of the monitored assets in order to reduce risks related to failures and to avoid service disruptions. The challenge is to collect and analyze all the data streams that come from the numerous on-board sensors monitoring the assets. This paper deals with the problem of CBM applied to the condition monitoring and predictive maintenance of train axle bearings based on sensors data collection, with the purpose of maximizing their Remaining Useful Life (RUL). In particular we propose a novel algorithm for CBM based on SDA that takes advantage of the Online Support Vector Regression (OL-SVR) for predicting the RUL. The novelty of our proposal is the heuristic approach for optimizing the trade-off between the accuracy of the OL-SVR models and the computational time and resources needed in order to build them. Results from tests on a real-world dataset show the actual benefits brought by the proposed methodology.","Data Analytics,Big Data Streams,Online Learning,Model Selection,Intelligent Transporta- tion Systems,Condition Based Maintenance,"
