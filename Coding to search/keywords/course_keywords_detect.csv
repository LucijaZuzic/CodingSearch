"vessel manoeuvring hot zone recognition and traffic analysis with ais data","2022","Automatic identification systems (AIS) are on-board compulsory devices on ships that can provide a large amount of dynamic vessel information, such as position, course and speed information, which is meaningful for marine management. This paper explores the potential to utilize AIS data to recognize ship manoeuvring hot zones and analyse their characteristics to improve marine management efficiency. First, considering manoeuvring behaviours such as turning, acceleration and deceleration, a novel approach based on MiniBatchKMeans that recognizes ship turning hot zones, acceleration hot zones and deceleration hot zones is proposed according to course and speed variation. Second, joint probability density functions for speed over ground (SOG) and course over ground (COG) are built taking into account the combined influences of motion characteristics, which are beneficial for determining the ship traffic rules in manoeuvring hot zones and utilized in marine management. Finally, numerical and comparison experiments are conducted to test the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method.","Vessel manoeuvring,Cluster,AIS,Hot zone,Joint probability density function,"
"multi-label classification for ais data anomaly detection using wavelet transform","2022","Thanks to the Automatic Identification System (AIS), ships and other maritime equipment are able to communicate with each other, for example, by sending information about their position. This solution allows for early collision detection when two or more ships are on a collision course. In the newer version of AIS, a satellite infrastructure is used to extend the communication range. Unfortunately, satellite AIS deals with so-called packet collision effect: since there is a problem with synchronizing AIS data coming from multiple terrestrial areas, a single satellite may receive several AIS messages at the same time and be unable to correctly process them, causing the data to get lost or garbled. In this article, a machine learning based framework for detecting the incorrect AIS data is presented. In this approach, after the first stage (clustering), a dedicated anomaly detection algorithm searches for damaged AIS messages and conducts multi-label classification (with Random Forest and wavelet transform) to decide which fields of such message requires further correction. The results of measuring the effectiveness of the proposed approach using real AIS data are presented.","telecommunication security,Clustering algorithms,incorrect AIS data,single satellite,Anomaly detection,Wavelet transforms,anomaly detection,random forests,collision course,Marine vehicles,Machine learning,damaged AIS messages,Data analysis,dedicated anomaly detection algorithm searches,satellite communication,ships,wavelet transform,pattern classification,random forest,Classification algorithms,multiple terrestrial areas,pattern clustering,machine learning based framework,Artificial intelligence,multi-label classification,multilabel classification,wavelet transforms,satellite infrastructure,AIS data anomaly detection,maritime equipment,communication range,Trajectory,marine communication,Labeling,early collision detection,AIS data analysis,packet collision effect,satellite AIS deals,"
"radar-based maritime collision avoidance using dynamic window","2018","Collision avoidance systems are a key ingredient in developing autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs). Such systems require real-time information about the environment, which can be obtained from transponder-based systems or exteroceptive sensors located on the ASV. In this paper, we present a closed-loop collision avoidance (COLAV) system using a maritime radar for detecting target ships, implemented on a 26 foot high-speed ASV. The system was validated in full-scale experiments in Trondheimsfjorden, Norway, in May 2017. The probabilistic data association filter (PDAF) is used for tracking target vessels. The output from the PDAF is processed through a least-squares retrodiction procedure in order to provide the COLAV system with sufficiently accurate course estimates. A tracking interface provides estimates of target states to the COLAV system, which is based on the dynamic window (DW) algorithm. DW is a reactive COLAV algorithm originally designed for ground vehicles, and we therefore make a number of modifications to adapt it for use with high-speed ASVs. The closed-loop experiments demonstrated successful COLAV with this system, but also disclosed several challenges arising from both the DW algorithm and the tracking system, motivating for further work.","sensor fusion,transponder-based systems,exteroceptive sensors,course estimates,collision avoidance systems,transponders,dynamic window algorithm,PDAF,target tracking,reactive COLAV algorithm,ships,COLAV system,closed loop systems,maritime collision avoidance,Target tracking,real-time information,Radar tracking,autonomous surface vehicles,Artificial intelligence,vessels,tracking system,Telemetry,mobile robots,Sensors,closed-loop collision avoidance system,high-speed ASV,collision avoidance,probabilistic data association filter,Heuristic algorithms,maritime radar,"
"vessel sailing patterns analysis from s-ais data dased on k-means clustering algorithm","2019","Automatic Identification System (AIS) provides abundant near real-time information of moving vessels in the sea of the whole world and has been widely used in the fields of vessel collision avoidance, Maritime Situation Awareness (MSA) and ocean surveillance. The development of satellite-based AIS further expands the range of AIS and enables a wide converge of AIS data collection, which solves the problem of lacking AIS data in high-seas. At the same time, AIS data provides a rich source for data mining for maritime traffic analysis. In this paper, a typical clustering algorithm called K-means is applied to deal with the Space-based AIS(S-AIS) data received by â€œTianTuo-3â€ satellite developed by National University of Defense Technology. We use Elbow Rule to determine the optimal number of clusters and calculate the normalized standard deviation of COG(Course Over Ground) and SOG(Speed Over Ground) of vessels in south Africa area as their features to conduct clustering. This method is supposed to evaluate vessels' sailing stability and used in detection of low-likelihood behaviors or anomalies of vessels.","SOG,surveillance,data mining,Clustering algorithms,vessel behavior,Marine vehicles,vessel collision avoidance,AIS data collection,ocean surveillance,TianTuo-3 satellite,elbow rule,speed over ground,space-based AIS ata,ships,satellite-based AIS,marine safety,K-means,marine engineering,automatic identification system,vessel anomaly,Elbow,k-means clustering algorithm,vessel sailing patterns analysis,pattern clustering,COG,Artificial intelligence,maritime traffic analysis,Satellite broadcasting,South Africa,course over ground,Trajectory,national security,artificial satellites,clustering algorithm,Data mining,normalized standard deviation,Maritime traffic analysis,Space-based AIS,S-AIS data,"
"use of the automatic identification system (ais) for maritime domain awareness (mda)","2005","The Automatic Identification System (AIS) was developed primarily as a tool for maritime safety - vessel collision avoidance, use by Vessel Traffic Services (VTS) and as a means for littoral states to get information on vessels operating near their coasts. AIS equipment aboard vessels continuously and autonomously transmits information about the vessel including its identity, position, course and speed to enhance safety. This information has also come to be seen by the U. S. Coast Guard as a critical tool in enhancing Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) in support of all Coast Guard missions. MDA is the effective understanding of anything associated with the global maritime environment that could affect the security, safety, economy, or environment of the United States. To achieve MDA, the Coast Guard must collect as much information as possible on activities occurring in the maritime domain. A large part of this activity relates to the movement of vessels, therefore detection, classification, identification and monitoring of vessels is a key component of MDA. The Coast Guard believes that AIS can provide a critical part of vessel tracking needs to build maritime domain awareness.","vessel identity,Broadcasting,maritime safety,maritime domain awareness,US Coast Guard,vessel collision avoidance,Global Positioning System,vessel speed,Information security,Radio transmitters,vessel tracking,Vessel Traffic Services,Application software,marine safety,Automatic Identification System,Collision avoidance,vessel position,Weather forecasting,Safety devices,vessel movement,vessel classification,maritime environment,vessel course,Marine safety,Navigation,marine vehicles,security,tracking,oceanographic techniques,"
"intelligent maritime surveillance framework driven by fusion of camera-based vessel detection and ais data","2022","Efficient maritime surveillance is necessary for navigation, which usually uses cameras to capture the vessels. However, the information in camera-based data is limited. In this work, we propose a novel intelligent maritime surveillance framework driven by the fusion of camera-based vessel detection and Automatic Identification System (AIS) data. Firstly, we employ a vessel detection network to get the relative positions of the vessels from the calibrated camera-based data. Meanwhile, we design a series of filters based on data completeness, detection range, and vessel course to exclude the invalid AIS data. In the end, we propose a data fusion module based on estimating the time when the vessel arrive at the specific position. According to the experiment on our collected dataset, the proposed framework performs competitively in diversified scenes. The mean absolute distance deviation of the estimation is less than 30 meters, and the accuracy of data fusion is 81.423%.","surveillance,sensor fusion,Automatic Identification System data,data acquisition,medical image processing,intelligent maritime surveillance framework driven,vessel detection network,image fusion,marine safety,invalid AIS data,cameras,object detection,camera-based vessel detection,Video surveillance,Data integration,detection range,Matched filters,Fuses,calibration,vessel course,Navigation,calibrated camera-based data,image segmentation,efficient maritime surveillance,Meters,Estimation,data fusion module,"
