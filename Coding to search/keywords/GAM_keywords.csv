"an investigation on the non-stationarity of flood frequency across the uk","2021","Water infrastructure design and flood mitigation projects are currently based on a so-called stationary assumption. However, this assumption has been challenged in recent years due to increased extreme weather, potentially leading to the underestimation of flood quantiles and an increased risk of structural failures. In the present study, peak flow series from 158 gauging stations in the UK are analysed using both stationary and non-stationary models based on the generalised additive models for location, scale and shape (GAMLSS) framework. Nine candidate covariates are used for non-stationary models to obtain information on the significant drivers of non-stationarity in each flood series. Very few stations are thus found to show temporal trends, which suggests that time-varying non-stationary flood models may not always be suitable, and the use of physically-based covariates can provide better-fitting models. In particular, the non-stationary models using rainfall-related covariates display the best performance for the vast majority of stations, thus suggesting that the variability of the rainfall regime remains the dominant driver for changes in flooding. Moreover, two atmospheric circulation patterns, namely the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the East Atlantic Pattern, were found to be closely related to the non-stationarity of flooding at a number of stations. Unlike rainfall, however, the influence of these climate indices is not particularly dominant; hence, they are more suitably employed as components of a multiple-covariate non-stationary model. Besides, a direct linkage between the variability of flooding and climate changes has not been identified either regionally or globally. For the majority of stations (70%), the use of multiple covariates can provide a better non-stationary model than the use of a single covariate.","Flood frequency analysis,Covariate,Non-stationarity,GAMLSS,UK,"
"terrestrial gamma-ray flashes in the bepposax data archive","2017","Up to now, Terrestrial Gamma-ray Flashes (TGFs) have been mostly observed by instruments on-board satellites devoted to astrophysics: after the discovery by the BATSE/CGRO experiment in the early 90's, this elusive phenomenon has been further detected by RHESSI, by the AGILE satellite and by the Fermi space telescope. The Italian/Dutch satellite BeppoSAX (1996–2002) was one of the most important high-energy astrophysics missions, especially for what concerns the field of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs). Its payload housed the Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GRBM), a segmented detector that could, in principle, have observed TGFs as well. Motivated by this possibility, we carried out, for the first time, a systematic search for TGFs in the BeppoSAX data archive, ending up with a sample of 12 TGF candidates. Among them, we also found a peculiar event, whose light curve characteristics may represent the signature of a mirrored Terrestrial Electron Beam (TEB).",""
"gammaex project: a solution for cbrn remote sensing using unmanned aerial vehicles in maritime environments","2017","Nowadays Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) agents are real threats, and they can be released from intentional and non-intentional sources. Intentional sources include weapons of mass destruction, and they can inflict serious amount of damage. CBRN non-intentional sources can go from disease outbreaks or even incidents, such as a nuclear accident. The interest for unmanned vehicles is growing more and more, either in military or civilian applications. In this scenario, they can be applied, especially Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The response to CBRN releases should follow several steps, such as reconnaissance of the affected area, detection of the agent, sampling, decontamination, victim screening, medical evacuation, identification of the type of agent and medical treatment. Therefore, UAVs can be an important asset in this scenario, as they bring many advantages, such as the access to inhospitable or inaccessible spaces, incorporation of sensors that can be used to identify the agent, and many other factors that increase the speed of the task, reducing at the same time the risk to personnel. In this paper, an UAV system is presented to fulfill the requirements of this issue, including the vehicle, sensors and control station. This system was tested and the validation tests are also represented. It proved to be an asset in CBRN releases, either intentional or non-intentional.","unmanned aerial vehicles,remote sensing,Robotics,military systems,Chemical and biological sensors,weapons of mass destruction,maritime environments,CBRN nonintentional sources,Remote Sensing,Biology,ATEX,autonomous aerial vehicles,Reconnaissance,weapons,Chemicals,Unmanned aerial vehicles,GammaEx project,Unmanned Systems,mobile robots,national security,CBRN,UAV system,Chemical sensors,marine control,CBRN agents,CBRN remote sensing,chemical biological radiological and nuclear agents,"
"temperature and salinity trends in the northern limit of the canary current upwelling system","2023","Thermohaline time series are crucial for detecting and quantifying abiotic changes in the marine environment, and even more so in the present global change scenario. This is particularly relevant for the Ría the Vigo and its adjacent shelf, a highly productive ecosystem at the northern limit of the Canary Current Upwelling System (CanCUS). This study analyses a 34-year time series (1987–2020) of Conductivity-Temperature-Depth (CTD) casts, the longest series available to date in the region. Long-term trends, shifts, and seasonal variability of temperature and salinity were assessed and investigated in relation to regional meteorological variability and basin-scale atmospheric teleconnection indices. Generalized Additive Models (GAM) allowed us to determine that monthly thermohaline variability can be largely explained by regional meteo-climatic variability, mainly upwelling index and river discharge. Trends and shifts in some teleconnection patterns, especially the East Atlantic (EA) pattern, may also be related to both the shift in salinity in 2013 and its long-term decrease below 50 m depth. Despite the current global warming context, no statistically significant trend was observed for either the upwelling index or temperature. The spatial analysis of sea surface temperature trends suggests that our study area has been responding to climate change differently from other surrounding near-shore areas, as the Finisterre Cape or the southern Bay of Biscay. Overall, this study highlights the importance of long-term observations to elucidate the impact of climate change in the northern limit of the CanCUS and encourages caution when extrapolating conclusions from ecosystem studies on a regional scale.",""
"additively manufactured materials and structures: a state-of-the-art review on their mechanical characteristics and energy absorption","2023","Lightweight materials and structures have been extensively studied for a wide range of applications in design and manufacturing of more environment-friendly and more sustainable products, such as less materials and lower energy consumption, while maintaining proper mechanical and energy absorption characteristics. Additive manufacturing (AM) or 3D printing techniques offer more freedom to realize some new designs of novel lightweight materials and structures in an efficient way. However, the rational design for desired mechanical properties of these materials and structures remains a demanding topic. This paper provides a comprehensive review on the recent advances in additively manufactured materials and structures as well as their mechanical properties with an emphasis on energy absorption applications. First, the additive manufacturing techniques used for fabricating various materials and structures are briefly reviewed. Then, a variety of lightweight AM materials and structures are discussed, together with their mechanical properties and energy-absorption characteristics. Next, the AM-induced defects, their impacts on mechanical properties and energy absorption, as well as the methods for minimizing the effects are discussed. After that, numerical modeling approaches for AM materials and structures are outlined. Furthermore, design optimization techniques are reviewed, including parametric optimization, topology optimization, and nondeterministic optimization with fabrication-induced uncertainties. Notably, data-driven and machine learning-based techniques exhibit compelling potential in design for additive manufacturing, process-property relations, and in-situ monitoring. Finally, significant challenges and future directions in this area are highlighted. This review is anticipated to provide a deep understanding of the state-of-the-art additively manufactured materials and structures, aiming to improve the future design for desired mechanical properties and energy absorption.","Mechanical property,Defect,Energy absorption,Cellular material,Lattice structure,Additive manufacturing,Machine learning,Optimization,"
"cetacean occurrence and spatial distribution: habitat modelling for offshore waters in the portuguese eez (ne atlantic)","2015","In the Portuguese Economic Exclusive Zone (EEZ) (NE Atlantic), little survey effort dedicated to cetacean species has been carried out in offshore waters. As a consequence, data on their occurrence, distribution and habitat preferences is scarce. In this area, 48 sea surveys along fixed transects within Continental Portugal and Madeira Island were performed in 2012 and 2013, from July to October, using platforms of opportunity. We used an environmental envelope approach and GAM habitat models to identify the role of oceanographic, topographic and geographical variables in shaping cetacean distribution. Results demonstrate the richness of offshore waters in this area as in 10,668nmi sampled, we recorded 218 sightings from at least nine cetacean species, resulting in an overall ER of 2.04 sightings/100nmi. The interaction of topographic and oceanographic features was shown to influence the distribution of the species/groups along the routes. Among the sighted species, only common dolphin showed a preference for coastal waters, while for all the other species high seas proved to be determinant. This result reinforces the need to address conservation issues in open ocean. This preliminary assessment showed the importance of the entire area for the distribution of different cetacean species and allowed the identification of several species/group specific potential suitable habitats. Considering the Habitats Directive resolutions, ACCOBAMS priorities, EEZ extension for the area and Maritime Spatial Planning Directive, and the urgent need for management plans, we suggest that the sampling strategy here presented is a cost-effective method to gather valuable data, to be used to improve cetacean habitat models in the area.","Management,Cetacean distribution,Portuguese EEZ,High seas,Habitat modelling,"
"game theoretical incentive for usv fleet-assisted data sharing in maritime communication networks","2023","With the rapid proliferations of maritime applications, the data demands of unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) keep ever-increasing. However, due to limitations of resources (e.g., energy, storage, bandwidth, etc.) and high costs on data sharing, USVs do not provide data proactively, which hinders the efficiency of data sharing. To tackle these problems, in this paper, we propose a game based USV fleet-assisted data sharing scheme to enable data exchange among USVs. Specially, we firstly propose a data publish/subscribe framework, where USVs are categorized into publishers and subscribers, and a USV fleet is motivated as a broker to relay data from publishers to subscribers. Then, the optimal waypoints for data publishing are recommended to the USV fleet to improve its probability of acquiring data. Furthermore, a Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) reverse auction game is utilized for data publishing, which ensures that the data publishers bid for USV fleets with own truthful costs, so as to avoid false bidding of data publishers. A double auction game is then employed for data subscription, which balances the benefits between the USV fleet and the data subscriber. An incentive-based data sharing algorithm is finally designed to obtain the optimal bidding strategies for all game parties including data publishers, USV fleets and data subscribers. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme efficiently increases the utilities of all participants, as compared to conventional schemes.","Oceans,Data models,auction game,data publish/subscribe,USV fleet,Costs,Games,Maritime communications,Relays,Maritime communication networks,Publishing,"
"a stackelberg game-theoretical approach to maritime counter-piracy","2019","In this paper, we provide a maritime counter-piracy framework to represent the strategies put in place and the interaction between a set of actors (patrollers and attackers) in a wide maritime scenario. Specifically, we model the interaction between patrollers and attackers in terms of a Stackelberg leader-follower game. With respect to the previous literature, we provide several innovations, in that we consider moving targets. Moreover, we let the attackers and patrollers ground their decisions not only on the current situation, but also on the expected evolution in the short or medium term. This is done by introducing in the payoff functions some projection terms, i.e., elements able to consider the future evolution of the scenario, up to a specified time window horizon. We conclude this paper with a simulation campaign considering a realistic test bed settled in the Gulf of Aden. Our experiments show that such a prediction is quite effective in generating better decisions allowing the patrollers to dynamically change targets. However, if the time horizon considered in the projection term is too large, we observe that the patrollers tend to patrol the area rather than focusing on specific vessels, and the resulting protection strategy has reduced effectiveness.","wide maritime scenario,moving targets,Bayes methods,specified time window horizon,Games,Stackelberg game-theoretical approach,Game theory,game theory,counter-piracy,maritime counter-piracy framework,Iris,future evolution,Antiterrorism,patrolling,defense strategy,Stackelberg leader-follower game,projection,Airports,Terrorism,"
"antenna beampattern matched optimum coherent detection in high-resolution mechanically scanning maritime surveillance radars","2023","Mechanically scanning radars are still widely used in ocean guard and surveillance areas nowadays, owing to simple structure, light weight and low cost. The antenna rotation causes amplitude modulation of target returns along pulses by the antenna azimuth beampattern. The traditional coherent detection that ignores this modulation suffers from some performance loss. In this article, an antenna beampattern matched optimum coherent detector and a dual-threshold detection scheme are proposed for high-resolution mechanically scanning maritime surveillance radars. First, it is shown that the modulation of target returns is determined by the antenna azimuth beampattern, scan rate, and pulse repetition interval and the antenna scanning also affect the temporal correlation of sea clutter. Second, the antenna beampattern matched optimum coherent detector is given in compound-Gaussian sea clutter with inverse Gamma distributed texture and the pulse scanning mode is used to deal with unknown target azimuth angle in the matched filter. Third, to mitigate the high computational cost of the pulse scanning mode, a dual-threshold scheme is given, which searches all pulse-range cells by short-time integration and further confirms suspected cells whose test statistics are between the two lower and higher thresholds in the search by long-time integration. Moreover, two fast recursive clutter covariance matrix inversion algorithms along pulses and range cells are presented, which bring a great reduction in computational complexity. Finally, real measured radar data is used to verify the proposed detector and scheme and the experimental results show that it behaves better in detection of small targets than the traditional detectors.","Antennas,covariance matrices,maritime surveillance radars,Radar antennas,mechanically scanning maritime surveillance radars,radar detection,radar clutter,high-resolution mechanically scanning maritime surveillance,compound-Gaussian sea clutter,sea clutter,amplitude modulation,target returns,dual-threshold detection scheme,matched filter,optimum coherent detector,scan rate,surveillance areas,ocean guard,gamma distribution,traditional coherent detection,dual-threshold scheme,Antenna beampattern matched optimum coherent detection,Gaussian processes,matrix inversion,search radar,measured radar data,unknown target,Radar,radar signal processing,antenna azimuth beampattern,antenna beampattern matched optimum coherent detection,high computational cost,azimuth beampattern modulation,Doppler radar,computational complexity,Clutter,scanning radars,fast recursive clutter covariance matrix inversion algorithms,pulse scanning mode,antenna rotation,Surveillance,pulse-range cells,antenna scanning,pulse repetition interval,Radar detection,"
"sea fog attenuation analysis of white-led light sources for maritime vlc","2019","Maritime VLC has features of high speed, low cost and anti-EMI. The scattering attenuation of sea fog particles for white-LED light source will directly affect the signal transmission. Due to meteorological effects, much physical detail could be lost in Maritime VLC. Effects of changes in the particle size distributions and influences of different sources cannot easily be taken into account. To address this issue, this paper presents scattering spectrum analysis of sea fog particles and attenuation of maritime VLC channel systematically. Firstly, based on sea fog parameters, the scattering, extinction and phase functions of sea fog particles can be calculated by employing Mie theory. Furthermore, scattering analysis of sea fog particle swarm could be evaluated. Then transmission attenuation of wide spectrum white-LED is analyzed by utilizing revised Gamma distribution. According to the sensitivity of the receiver detector in visible light band, the change of white light transmission spectrum is weighted. At last, combined with the white LED spectrum collected by the experiment, simulations describe that spectrum changes of white LED are obtained after transmission for a certain distance.","visible light band,receiver detector,particle size,particle size distributions,scattering functions,Absorption,sea fog particles,light emitting diodes,Gamma distribution,antiEMI,Mie theory,scattering analysis,scattering attenuation,scatting,optical links,fog sea,meteorological effects,fog,signal transmission,Atmospheric modeling,Scattering,free-space optical communication,Attenuation,scattering spectrum analysis,extinction functions,light attenuation,maritime VLC channel,sea fog particle swarm,Particle swarm optimization,Mie scattering,Atmospheric measurements,sea fog attenuation analysis,electromagnetic interference,underwater optical wireless communication,maritime transmission,light transmission,white LED spectrum,white light transmission spectrum,sea fog parameters,wide spectrum white-LED,transmission attenuation,white-LED light source,phase functions,Light emitting diodes,wide spectrum,"

"fitting empirical distributions for vessels behavioural analysis and maritime anomaly detection","2023","Naval behaviour characterization and maritime anomaly detection represents two active area of research. Although multiple probabilistic approaches have been implemented for explaining different parametric maritime phenomena, most of them are focused only on the analysis of primary kinematic data, such as position, speed, course of vessels, or lateral displacement relative to an obstacle. This article presents an analysis on multiple complex maritime activities (e.g., fishing, drifting, hidden activities) that were derived by processing AIS messages collected in the Black Sea region. Quantitative histograms were made for each type of activity while probability and cumulative distribution functions were plotted using kernel density estimation applications. After that, multiple evaluation metrics analysed the possibilities of representing these distributions in the form of known parametric distributions (e.g., Gaussian, Gamma, Rayleigh, Log-normal). Finally, there were extracted the parameters that best fitted these distributions. Also, a universal parametric distribution was searched to best fit all observed maritime activities.","statistical distributions,universal parametric distribution,kernel density estimation applications,Safety,primary kinematic data,AIS messages,vessel behavioural analysis,Sea measurements,cumulative distribution functions,parametric maritime phenomena,probabilistic approaches,quantitative histograms,marine engineering,hidden activities,AIS,vessels behaviour,Probabilistic logic,Probability distribution,probability distribution fitting,Measurement,maritime anomaly detection,Statistical analysis,empirical distributions,naval behaviour characterization,Fitting,Black Sea region,empirical data,data handling,multiple complex maritime activities,"
"additive manufacturing of ultra-high strength steels: a review","2023","Ultra-high strength steels (UHSSs) have excellently comprehensive mechanical properties, which has attracted significant interest in their advanced manufacturing. Additively manufactured UHSSs have a unique microstructure that provides significant potential to achieve good mechanical properties. This paper reviews the latest research progress in the additive manufacturing (AM) of UHSSs with a special focus on defect optimization, microstructure-property regulation and the application of advanced assisted techniques for additively manufactured UHSSs. The property origin of UHSSs is firstly summarized in detail, including the influence of different alloying elements and phase composition in the microstructure on the mechanical properties of UHSSs. The AM techniques used to fabricate UHSSs and the characteristics of their forming microstructure are further illustrated, which involve laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF), laser direct energy deposition (L-DED), and wire arc additive manufacturing (WAAM). The research progress on the three typical techniques for UHSSs is also reviewed. Moreover, the property regulation methodology of UHSSs is reviewed, mainly in the optimization of defects and the adjustment of the whole forming process. Significantly, the shortcomings of the present researches on AMed UHSSs and future challenges for development are discussed. This work is important for a better scientific understanding of AMed UHSSs and provides vital meaningful guidelines for the future work in UHSSs manufacturing.","Microstructure,Ultra-high strength steels,Process-microstructure-property regulation,Defect optimization,Additive manufacturing,"
"green rf/fso communications in cognitive relay-based space information networks for maritime surveillance","2019","In this paper, we provide an overview of a space-based network for the maritime surveillance information sharing and evaluate the coverage, the throughput and the real-time reception capacity of the presented systems. The focus is on the feeder link of a multi-hop geostationary satellite system. We propose a cognitive relay-based architecture for the inter-satellite and satellite-to-ground communication with a multi-band spectrum sensing operating on both free-space optical (FSO) and radio frequency (RF) bands. Furthermore, modeling the spectrum sensing energy as a Gamma distribution we derive the formula of the network energy consumption in presence of multipath fading and considering two different data relay schemes: amplify-and-forward (AF) and decode-and-forward (DF). We prove that the RF/FSO communication in the proposed relay-based architecture enhances the data transmission increasing the throughput and the real-time reception capacity and reducing the network energy consumption. The performance evaluation shows that the DF scheme overcomes the AF one in terms of energy consumption while the AF scheme overcomes the DF one in terms of probability detection, both experience the same throughput. Finally, the proposed novel architecture has been compared with existing ones showing that it enhances the current maritime surveillance systems by jointly optimizing communication functionalities.","inter-satellite communication,surveillance,telecommunication power management,cognitive radio,real-time reception capacity,multi-hop networks,satellite systems,Marine vehicles,radio frequency free-space optical communications,cognitive relay-based networks,radio spectrum management,green RF/FSO communications,free-space optical communication,Satellite communication,detection probability,network energy consumption,marine engineering,optimisation,coverage evaluation,amplify-and-forward,multiband spectrum sensing,feeder link,decode-and-forward,maritime surveillance information sharing,space information networks,multihop geostationary satellite system,Spread spectrum communication,relay networks (telecommunication),decode and forward communication,data relay,satellite links,Maritime surveillance,signal detection,satellite-to-ground communication,Surveillance,throughput,RF/FSO communication,multipath fading,network energy,amplify and forward communication,oceanographic techniques,"
"in-situ acoustic monitoring of direct energy deposition process with deep learning-assisted signal denoising","2022","In-situ monitoring is crucial for detecting process anomalies and ensuring part quality in additive manufacturing. Acoustic-based monitoring techniques offer extra benefits such as adjustable sensor setup and lower hardware costs. In the direct energy deposition (DED) process, acoustic signals generated by laser-material interactions carry information about underlying complex physical mechanisms such as melting, solidification, crack propagation, and pore formation. This paper presents a novel acoustic-based in-situ monitoring method for the DED process. The raw acoustic signal is made up of laser-material interaction sound as well as noise from machine movement, inert gas flow, and powder flow. A deep learning model is developed to build an end-to-end signal denoising framework to minimize environmental noise and extract the laser-material interaction sound. Audio equalization, bandpass filtering, and Harmonic-Percussive Source Separation algorithm are used to produce a cleaned laser-material interaction sound as the model's ground truth target. Acoustic data is collected from experiments using different DED machines, materials, and varied process parameters to train the deep learning model. The proposed deep learning-assisted signal denoising strategy lays the groundwork for acoustic-based in-situ defect detection of the DED process.","Acoustic Signal Processing,Additive Manufacturing,Direct Energy Deposition,Sound Source Separation,In-situ Monitoring,Deep Learning,"
"visual drone detection and tracking for autonomous operation from maritime vessel","2022","To allow incorporation of autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV's/drones) into maritime military operations, it is critical to be able to accurately localize the UAV with respect to the moving maritime vessel during the take-off and landing phases.
