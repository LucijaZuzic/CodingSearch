"a non-cooperative long-range biometric system for maritime surveillance","2008","To address the challenges on non-cooperative long-distance human identification and verification, we propose an innovative cost-efficient system for automatic long-range biometric recognition of non-cooperative individuals in 24/7 operations. The system has three cameras. One is a wide field of view (WFOV) CCD video camera with an Infrared (IR) filter and powerful IR illuminators for human scan in a wide area at a long distance. The other two cameras are high resolution video cameras with narrow field of view (NFOV) and an IR filter & illuminators, mounted on a pan-tilt-unit (PTU) to capture the frontal view of human face and iris respectively. Once the frontal views of moving individuals are captured by the NFOV cameras, the face/iris models will be extracted and classified by the state-of-the-art face/iris recognizers. The hardware of the biometric system also includes one FPGA, three DSP processors, and one Zigbee module for fast bio-data analysis and wireless data transmission.","surveillance,image resolution,Cameras,imaging sensor,field programmable gate arrays,radio applications,Filters,infrared filter,wireless data transmission,human face capture,DSP processor,biometrics (access control),noncooperative long-range biometric system,face recognition,Charge coupled devices,marine systems,Biometrics,filtering theory,Iris,maritime surveillance,Humans,feature extraction,image classification,biometric recognition,human scan,Face,digital signal processing chips,infrared imaging,video camera,image sensors,bio-data analysis,Surveillance,Data mining,Charge-coupled image sensors,Zigbee module,video cameras,"
"detecting outlier pairs in complex network based on link structure and semantic relationship","2017","In this paper, we propose an outlier pair detection method, called LSOutPair, which discovers the vast differences between link structure and semantic relationship. LSOutPair addresses three important challenges: (1) how can we measure the target object's link similarity among multi-typed objects and multi-typed relations? (2) how can we measure the semantic similarity using the short texts? (3) how can we find the objects’ maximum differences between link structure and semantic relationship? To tackle these challenges, LSOutPair applies three main techniques: (1) two matrices are used to store link similarity and semantic similarity, (2) a k-step index algorithm, which calculates the term weighting for each object, (3) applying the linear transformation of Frobenius norm to matrices can obtain the top-K outlier pairs. LSOutPair considers link and semantics in complex network simultaneously, which is a new attempt in data mining. Substantial experiments show that LSOutPair is very effective for outlier pair detection.","Complex network,Semantic relationship,Outlier pair detection,-step index,Link structure,"
"vessel track information mining using ais data","2014","In recent years, vessel traffic and maritime situation awareness become more and more important for countries across the world. AIS data contains much information about vessel motion and reflects traffic characteristics. In this paper, data mining is introduced to discover motion patterns of vessel movements. Firstly, we do statistical analysis for large scale of AIS data. Secondly, we use association rules to analyze the frequent moving status of vessels. We extend the dimensions of data features, improve the algorithm in efficiency and import the concept of time scale in the algorithm based on the previous relative work. Thirdly, we introduce Markov model to make supplement for the association rules. The prediction results in the Markov process are further used to do the anomaly detection. The method in this paper provides novel idea for the research in AIS data and the management of maritime traffic.","Markov processes,data mining,Clustering algorithms,Association rules,vessel movements,Hidden Markov models,anomaly detection,Marine vehicles,Markov model,vessel traffic,maritime traffic management,statistical analysis,motion patterns,association rules,Data models,Markov,traffic information systems,vessel track information mining,traffic characteristics,maritime situation awareness,frequent moving status,vessel motion,marine vehicles,AIS data,"
"conflictfinder: mining maritime traffic conflict from massive ship trajectories","2017","Collision-free is one of the major safety concerns for maritime traffic management. To analyze the collision data and understand the cause of the collision can contribute the improvement of the maritime traffic safety and management. However, the real collisions is not always available to analyze. Based on a massive AIS trajectory data collected, we focus on mining the ships' movement behaviors those may bring a possible collision if they do not take any avoidance, called Maritime Traffic Conflict. Even though the maritime traffic conflict is a non-accident incident, the movement behaviors of maritime traffic conflict may have the similar behaviors of navigational collision for analysis. Thus, we propose ConflictFinder to provide a framework for maritime traffic conflict mining. Different from existing methods those focus on detecting the conflicts between two ships in a restricted water way, we discover the conflicts occurred by multi-ships in open sea. For analysis of maritime traffic conflicts, a prototype of ConflictFinder is implemented which helps with gaining a better understanding of traffic conflicts discovered and can be applied to the improvement of maritime traffic safety evaluation and management.","AIS Data,data mining,maritime traffic conflict,Safety,Marine vehicles,mining maritime traffic,massive AIS trajectory data,Trajectory Data Mining,massive ship trajectories,ships,collision data analysis,marine safety,maritime traffic safety evaluation,marine engineering,ship movement behaviors,maritime traffic safety management,Prototypes,Artificial intelligence,ConflictFinder,Conflict Detection,Maritime Traffic,Trajectory,navigational collision,restricted water way,open sea,maritime traffic safety,Navigation,Data mining,collision free,"

Exploring, analyzing and finding anomalous behavior within this data is a complex task.

"mining vessel tracking data for maritime domain applications","2016","The growing number of remote sensing systems and ship reporting technologies (e.g. Automatic Identification System, Long Range Identification and Tracking, radar tracking, Earth Observation) are generating an overwhelming amount of spatio-temporal and geographically distributed data related to vessels and their movements. Research on reliable data mining techniques has proven essential to the discovery of knowledge from such increasingly available information on ship traffic at sea. Data driven knowledge discovery has very recently demonstrated its value in fields that go beyond the original maritime safety and security remits of such data. They include, but are not limited to, fisheries management, maritime spatial planning, gridding ship emissions, mapping activities at sea, risk assessment of offshore platforms, and trade indicators. The extraction of useful information from maritime Big Data is thus a key element in providing operational authorities, policy-makers and scientists with supporting tools to understand what is happening at sea and improve maritime knowledge.

"fuzzy/human risk analysis for maritime situational awareness and decision support","2017","Human computation (HC) is an active research field in which people play a notable role as computational elements in an automated system with the aim of arriving at a truly symbiotic human-computer interaction. Situational awareness (SA) and decision support systems (DSSs) are two domains where human computation is rapidly advancing, with the latter arising as an invaluable vehicle to achieve the former. Fuzzy systems and fuzzy logic are two commonly employed tools in these domains due to their inherent capabilities of representing and processing vague and imprecise information while conveying the analysis results in an interpretable fashion. In this paper, we elaborate on the human computation aspects of risk analysis within SA and DSS conducted with the aid of fuzzy sets. The study makes the following contributions: (1) we argue that risk analysis must be a highly automated yet still human-centric endeavour and highlight four manners in which the human component provides value to the underlying data/information fusion processes; (2) we illustrate this fuzzy/human risk analysis methodology through a multi-modular Risk Management Framework (RMF) architecture and its application to the maritime domain, particularly in hard-soft data fusion, automated response generation to maritime incidents, port anomaly filtering and dynamic risk management triggered by contextual knowledge and (3) the framework under discussion can be extrapolated to other domains with negligible effort.","decision support systems,RMF,HC,Risk management,Hidden Markov models,human computer interaction,Human computer interaction,fuzzy logic,maritime situational awareness,marine engineering,risk management,human computation,Spread spectrum communication,Decision support systems,human risk analysis,DSS,risk management framework,fuzzy systems,Data mining,Fuzzy risk analysis,"

"routeminer: mining ship routes from a massive maritime trajectories","2014","Mining trajectory data has been attracting significant interest in the last years. By analyzing trajectory data, we are able to discover the movement behavior and location-aware knowledge, and then develop many interesting applications such as movement behavior discovery, location prediction, traffic analysis, and so on. However, trajectory data mining is a challenge task because of the trajectory data is available with uncertainty. Furthermore, discovering the valuable knowledge from maritime trajectory is made even more difficult due to the maritime area is a free moving space. Unlike the vehicles' movements are constrained by road networks, there is no such a sea route for ships to follow in maritime area. A ship's movement may not exactly repeat the same trajectory even the ship has the similar movement behavior with others. In this work, Route Miner system provides a framework of ship route mining for maritime traffic analysis. Given a set of ship trajectories in a maritime area, Route Miner explore the movement behavior from those massive trajectories in a free moving space. Then, ship routes are detected based on those behavioral pattern. Finally, the system generates a set of ships routes to provide operators a better understanding from ship trajectory data.

"seaport data space for improving logistic maritime operations","2020","The maritime industry expects several improvements to efficiently manage the operation processes by introducing Industry 4.0 enabling technologies. Seaports are the most critical point in the maritime logistics chain because of its multimodal and complex nature. Consequently, coordinated communication among any seaport stakeholders is vital to improving their operations. Currently, Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Port Community Systems (PCS), as primary enablers of digital seaports, have demonstrated their limitations to interchange information on time, accurately, efficiently, and securely, causing high operation costs, low resource management, and low performance. For these reasons, this contribution presents the Seaport Data Space (SDS) based on the Industrial Data Space (IDS) reference architecture model to enable a secure data sharing space and promote an intelligent transport multimodal terminal. Each seaport stakeholders implements the IDS connector to take part in the SDS and share their data. On top of SDS, a Big Data architecture is integrated to manage the massive data shared in the SDS and extract useful information to improve the decision-making. The architecture has been evaluated by enabling a port authority and a container terminal to share its data with a shipping company. As a result, several Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) have been developed by using the Big Data architecture functionalities. The KPIs have been shown in a dashboard to allow easy interpretability of results for planning vessel operations.

To utilize aforementioned features available in Automatic information system (AIS), we formulate the problem in a novel way, by detecting anomalies in a set of directed graphs representing the movement pattern at each time interval.

In order to support the operator while monitoring such systems, the identification of anomalous vessels or situations that might need further investigation may reduce the operator's cognitive load. While it is worth acknowledging that many existing mining applications support identification of anomalous behavior, autonomous anomaly detection systems are rarely used in the real world, since the detection of anomalous behavior is normally not a well-defined problem and therefore, human expert knowledge is needed. This calls for the development of interaction components that can support the user in the detection process. In order to support the comprehension of the knowledge embedded in the system, we propose an interactive way of visualizing expert rules and normal behavioral models built from the data.

This paper aims to propose a novel shipping-route extraction algorithm to process historical AIS data (running into tens of gigabytes of daily data, from more than a hundred thousand maritime vessels), to effectively characterize global shipping route behaviour and capture its seasonal trends. This is done by formulating a sigmoid based turning waypoint identification, which does not solely depend on the change in the course of a vessel, derived from AIS message. The AIS data is further processed to excerpt the vesselâ€™s distance from the nearest port and nearest shore with resolution of about 1 km, which forms a handy metric for the identification of suspicious ports. Several other use cases are also explored, which include detecting various anomalies in individual vessel behaviour such as intentional or unintentional switching off AIS transmission, shipping-lane deviations, spoofing transmission messages. To tackle spoofing anomaly, various spoofing identification methods are discussed. A region-based spoofing identification algorithm is developed to identify spoofing points under multiple categories using a clustering algorithm. All the results are visualized through an open-source map overlay. The results contribute to a growing body of fast shipping route analysis algorithms.","Pattern recognition,fleet monitoring,Clustering algorithms,size 1.0 km,Folium,AIS transmission,ground-station receivers,historical AIS data-dumps,maritime vessels,Switches,security of data,maritime security,vessel behaviour,maritime logistical planning,Transmitters,global shipping route behaviour,Turning,logistics,ships,marine safety,Route Extraction,marine engineering,nearest port,Automatic Identification system,Port catalogue,vessel traffic services,automatic information system spoofing detection,Data Mining,shipping-route extraction algorithm,vessel collisions,Artificial intelligence,AIS message,maritime vessel route extraction,time-stamped static,data scientists,spoofing identification methods,AIS spoofing detection,Market research,DBSCAN Clustering Algorithm,fast shipping route analysis algorithms,Data mining,global ocean-currents,Python,nearest shore,marine researchers,"
"a bayesian parametric statistical anomaly detection method for finding trends and patterns in criminal behavior","2013","In this paper we describe how Bayesian Principal Anomaly Detection (BPAD) can be used for detecting long and short term trends and anomalies in geographically tagged alarm data. We elaborate on how the detection of such deviations can be used for high-lighting suspected criminal behavior and activities. BPAD has previously been successively deployed and evaluated in several similar domains, including Maritime Domain Awareness, Train Fleet Maintenance, and Alarm filtering. Similar as for those applications, we argue in the paper that the deployment of BPAD in area of crime monitoring potentially can improve the situation awareness of criminal activities, by providing automatic detection of suspicious behaviors, and uncovering large scale patterns.","Anomaly detection,Bayes methods,Monitoring,Situation awareness,Data analysis,Image color analysis,behavioural sciences computing,geographically tagged alarm data,situation awareness improvement,Bayesian statistics,Bayesian parametric statistical anomaly detection method,criminal behavior trends,BPAD,Criminal behaviour,criminal behavior pattern,crime monitoring,suspected criminal behavior,suspicious behavior automatic detection,Market research,suspected criminal activities,Data collection,Data mining,police data processing,"
"an analysis of wintertime navigational accidents in the northern baltic sea","2017","Navigational accidents in wintertime conditions occur relatively frequently, yet there is little systematic knowledge available about the circumstances under which these occur. This paper presents an analysis of navigational shipping accidents in the Northern Baltic Sea area which occurred in the period 2007–2013. The analysis is based on an integration of various data sources, aiming to reconstruct the accident conditions based on the best available data sources. Apart from basic accident information from the original accident databases, data from the Automatic Identification System is used to obtain insight in the operation type during which the accident occurred, as well as into other dynamic aspects of the accident scenario. Finally, atmospheric and sea ice data is used to reconstruct the navigational conditions under which the accidents occurred. The analysis aims to provide qualitative insights in patterns and outlier cases in the accidental conditions. Correspondingly, visual data mining is selected as analysis approach, because of its utility in obtaining qualitative knowledge from data sources through a combination of visualization techniques and human interaction with the data. Special attention is given to the strength of evidence of the identified accident patterns. The results are primarily useful for improving risk analyses focusing on oil spill risks in winter conditions and for developing realistic training scenarios for oil spill response operations.","Maritime risk,Maritime safety,Winter navigation operations,Visual data mining,AIS data,Accident data analysis,"
"a review of maritime spatio-temporal data analytics","2021","The vessels in maritime regions need to be specifically monitored and assessed since they play an important role in environment, safety, economy and security. One of the technologies that has been developed to monitor vessels that are sailing is Automatic Identification System (AIS). While AISâ€™s initial purpose was to provide automatic reporting between ships, it is now a primary source of worldwide information of maritime vessels. The navigational data that is transmitted by the vessels over AIS falls under the category of spatio-temporal data, which implies that it includes the dimension of space as well as time. This added dimension of time gives considerable insight into the information that can be ascertained from the data, however, at the expense of added complexity in analysis. Two of the major application areas that are being analysed are Maritime Surveillance and Maritime Spatial Planning. Both of these try to gain insights from AIS data to enhance the available information in their context. Analysing this requires various data analytic techniques to be applied to it. This paper examines this field of study, right from the data to information stage.","primary source,surveillance,Safety,sustainable development,automatic reporting,maritime regions,information stage,maritime vessels,Planning,maritime spatio-temporal data analytics,Maritime Spatial Planning,Data Analytics,considerable insight,worldwide information,Data analysis,Reproducibility of results,added complexity,data analysis,economy,ships,monitor vessels,Performance evaluation,marine engineering,data analytic techniques,Automatic Identification System,Maritime Surveillance,AIS,renewable energy sources,Data Mining,navigational data,Machine Learning,Spatio-temporal Data,AIS's initial purpose,Navigation,Surveillance,security,AIS data,Maritime Situational Awareness,aquaculture,"
"maritime pattern extraction from ais data using a genetic algorithm","2016","The long term prediction of maritime vessels' destinations and arrival times is essential for making an effective logistics planning. As ships are influenced by various factors over a long period of time, the solution cannot be achieved by analyzing sailing patterns of each entity separately. Instead, an approach is required, that can extract maritime patterns for the area in question and represent it in a form suitable for querying all possible routes any vessel in that region can take. To tackle this problem we use a genetic algorithm (GA) to cluster vessel position data obtained from the publicly available Automatic Identification System (AIS). The resulting clusters are treated as route waypoints (WP), and by connecting them we get nodes and edges of a directed graph depicting maritime patterns. Since standard clustering algorithms have difficulties in handling data with varying density, and genetic algorithms are slow when handling large data volumes, in this paper we investigate how to enhance the genetic algorithm to allow fast and accurate waypoint identification. We also include a quad tree structure to preprocess data and reduce the input for the GA. When the route graph is created, we add post processing to remove inconsistencies caused by noise in the AIS data. Finally, we validate the results produced by the GA by comparing resulting patterns with known inland water routes for two Dutch provinces.","data mining,Clustering algorithms,Genetic algorithms,vessel position data cluster,marine navigation,directed graph,maritime pattern extraction,sailing pattern analysis,quadtrees,Biological cells,genetic algorithms,genetic algorithm,ships,Genetic Algorithms,automatic identification system,inland water routes,Dutch provinces,logistics planning,Automatic Identification System,quad tree structure,Data Mining,directed graphs,pattern clustering,Artificial intelligence,route querying,maritime vessel destination prediction,Pattern Recognition,Logistics,Synchromodal Logistics,long term prediction,route waypoints,Boats,logistics data processing,Data mining,AIS data,arrival time prediction,data handling,"
"extraction of maritime road networks from large-scale ais data","2019","Extracting road network information including lane boundaries, lane centerlines, junctions and their relationship from AIS data plays an important role in location based services, urban computing and intelligent transportation systems, etc. However, AIS data are large scale, high noisy, the density and quality are very uneven in different areas, extracting a whole, continuous and smooth maritime road network with rich information from such data is a challenging problem. To address these issues, this paper proposes an adaptive maritime road network extraction approach that can extract both lane boundaries and centerlines for a large sea area from AIS data. Based on a road network definition including nodes, segments and segment curves, the approach designs parallel grid merging and filtering algorithms to determine if a grided area is inside lane or not. Lane boundaries are smoothed through jagged edge filtering and Simple Moving Average algorithms before centerline extraction. We evaluate our method based on real world AIS data in various area across the world's seas.

"can we trust the ais destination port information for bulk ships?–implications for shipping policy and practice","2021","The Automatic Identification System (AIS) is a shipping database that includes the physical characteristics and real-time dynamics of ships. It has attracted great attention from academia recently and has been broadly applied in solving various problems in different fields. The voyage destination report is a piece of information recorded in AIS that indicates the heading port in a ship’s voyage. This information is widely referred to by port operators for traffic estimation, and by shipping traders for supply forecasting, etc. However, we find that a considerable proportion (nearly 40%) of this information has been erroneously entered, both intentionally and unintentionally. In this paper, we aim to propose targeted policies to correct the inaccurate reports based on assessing the probability of observing wrong destination port reports of ships in AIS. To this end, we first of all conduct extensive interviews with relevant shipping stakeholders to understand the reasons behind the wrong destination reports. Second, based on the interviews and relevant literature we propose the influence factors. Third, we generate a data sample set based on the voyages performed by Capesize and Panamax bulk ships around the globe in a year. To generate this sample set, we leverage data mining techniques to extract the information from an AIS database and other databases. Finally, a discrete choice model is built to achieve the proposed objective. The results demonstrate that our model has an 84.1% accuracy rate in ascertaining the correctness of destination reports observed in AIS. We also find that, for a voyage, the speed of the ship, the historical accuracy rate of destination reports made by the ship, and the distance between the recognized origin and the reported destination of the voyage, have the most significant impacts on the accuracy of the destination report. Based on the findings, we provide managerial and policy suggestions to ship operators, port authorities, and regulators.","AIS data,Shipping management,Data mining,Discrete choice model,"

The multidimensional outlying features are first identified and defined. To deal with the uncertain property of trajectory, a maritime trajectory modeling is developed to explore the movement behavior from historical trajectories and build a maritime trajectory model for anomaly detection.

"risk management with hard-soft data fusion in maritime domain awareness","2014","Enhanced situational awareness is integral to risk management and response evaluation. Dynamic systems that incorporate both hard and soft data sources allow for comprehensive situational frameworks which can supplement physical models with conceptual notions of risk. The processing of widely available semi-structured textual data sources can produce soft information that is readily consumable by such a framework. In this paper, we augment the situational awareness capabilities of a recently proposed risk management framework (RMF) with the incorporation of soft data. We illustrate the beneficial role of the hard-soft data fusion in the characterization and evaluation of potential vessels in distress within Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) scenarios. Risk features pertaining to maritime vessels are defined a priori and then quantified in real time using both hard (e.g., Automatic Identification System, Douglas Sea Scale) as well as soft (e.g., historical records of worldwide maritime incidents) data sources. A risk-aware metric to quantify the effectiveness of the hard-soft fusion process is also proposed. Though illustrated with MDA scenarios, the proposed hard-soft fusion methodology within the RMF can be readily applied to other domains.","Feeds,RMF,sensor fusion,Risk management,Hidden Markov models,dynamic systems,Marine vehicles,maritime domain awareness,maritime vessels,Feature extraction,hard data sources,situational frameworks,semistructured textual data sources processing,automatic identification system,marine safety,MDA scenarios,marine engineering,risk-aware metric,risk management,response evaluation,situational awareness,Measurement,risk features,Douglas sea scale,worldwide maritime incidents,risk management framework,soft data sources,marine vehicles,Data mining,hard-soft data fusion,"
"automatic identification of maritime incidents from unstructured articles","2018","In this paper, we present two Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for identifying maritime incidents described in unstructured articles from multiple sources. The first technique is a document classification scheme that determines if an article describes a maritime incident. Two variations of each article are created: the first only contains the article's title, the other contains the title and content. These are converted to both binary and frequency bags-of-words. Furthermore, two feature selection methods are tested: Weka's CfsSubsetEval and retaining the 300 most frequent words. Each dataset is tested with 41 classifiers from the Weka suite, with the most accurate classifiers including Logistic Regression (98.5%), AdaBoostM1(BayesNet) (98.33%), and RandomForest (97.56%). The second technique performs information extraction on an article to determine the location of the maritime incident. In addition to using regular expressions and Named Entity Recognition (NER), the approach focuses its attention on sentences that contain piracy keywords as well as sentences which occur earlier in the article. In our testing, this approach achieved 87.9% accuracy. Together the two techniques form a pipeline where the positive examples from the document classification algorithm are fed into the information extraction algorithm.","Risk management,unstructured articles,information extraction algorithm,Natural Language Processing,Information retrieval,word processing,Conferences,Feature extraction,natural language processing,maritime risk assessment,regression analysis,automatic maritime incident identification,RandomForest,Weka suite classifiers,marine engineering,Logistic Regression,piracy keywords,feature extraction,pattern classification,risk management,random processes,Named Entity Recognition,feature selection,document classification,text analysis,Natural language processing,Task analysis,Weka CfsSubsetEval,Data mining,learning (artificial intelligence),binary bags-of-words,AdaBoostM1,frequency bags-of-words,"
"data-driven detection and context-based classification of maritime anomalies","2015","Discovering anomalies at sea is one of the critical tasks of Maritime Situational Awareness (MSA) activities and an important enabler for maritime security operations. This paper proposes a data-driven approach to anomaly detection, highlighting challenges specific to the maritime domain. This work builds on unsupervised learning techniques which provide models for normal traffic behaviour. A methodology to associate tracks to the derived traffic model is then presented. This is done by the pre-extraction of contextual information as the baseline patterns of life (i.e., routes) in the area under investigation. In addition to a brief description of the approach to derive the routes, their characterization and representation is presented in support of exploitable knowledge to classify anomalies. A hierarchical reasoning is proposed where new tracks are first associated to existing routes based on their positional information only and â€œoff-routeâ€ vesselsâ€ are detected. Then, for on-route vessels further anomalies are detected such as â€œspeed anomalyâ€ or â€œheading anomalyâ€.

"an unsupervised learning method with convolutional auto-encoder for vessel trajectory similarity computation","2021","To achieve reliable mining results for massive vessel trajectories, one of the most important challenges is how to efficiently compute the similarities between different vessel trajectories. The computation of vessel trajectory similarity has recently attracted increasing attention in the maritime data mining research community. However, traditional shape- and warping-based methods often suffer from several drawbacks such as high computational cost and sensitivity to unwanted artifacts and non-uniform sampling rates, etc. To eliminate these drawbacks, we propose an unsupervised learning method which automatically extracts low-dimensional features through a convolutional auto-encoder (CAE). In particular, we first generate the informative trajectory images by remapping the raw vessel trajectories into two-dimensional matrices while maintaining the spatio-temporal properties. Based on the massive vessel trajectories collected, the CAE can learn the low-dimensional representations of informative trajectory images in an unsupervised manner. The trajectory similarity is finally equivalent to efficiently computing the similarities between the learned low-dimensional features, which strongly correlate with the raw vessel trajectories. Comprehensive experiments on realistic data sets have demonstrated that the proposed method largely outperforms traditional trajectory similarity computation methods in terms of efficiency and effectiveness. The high-quality trajectory clustering performance could also be guaranteed according to the CAE-based trajectory similarity computation results.","Convolutional neural network (CNN),Convolutional auto-encoder (CAE),Automatic identification system (AIS),Trajectory clustering,Trajectory similarity,"
"toward the automated construction of probabilistic knowledge graphs for the maritime domain","2021","International maritime crime is becoming increasingly sophisticated, often associated with wider criminal networks. Detecting maritime threats by means of fusing data purely related to physical movement (i.e., those generated by physical sensors, or hard data) is not sufficient. This has led to research and development efforts aimed at combining hard data with other types of data (especially human-generated or soft data). Existing work often assumes that input soft data is available in a structured format, or is focused on extracting certain relevant entities or concepts to accompany or annotate hard data. Much less attention has been given to extracting the rich knowledge about the situations of interest implicitly embedded in the large amount of soft data existing in unstructured formats (such as intelligence reports and news articles). In order to exploit the potentially useful and rich information from such sources, it is necessary to extract not only the relevant entities and concepts, but also their semantic relations, together with the uncertainty associated with the extracted knowledge (i.e., in the form of probabilistic knowledge graphs). This will increase the accuracy of, and confidence in, the extracted knowledge and facilitate subsequent reasoning and learning. To this end, we propose Maritime DeepDive, an initial prototype for the automated construction of probabilistic knowledge graphs from natural language data for the maritime domain. In this paper, we report on the current implementation of Maritime DeepDive, together with preliminary results on extracting probabilistic events from maritime piracy incidents. This pipeline was evaluated on a manually crafted gold standard, yielding promising results.","Semantics,Pipelines,data mining,criminal networks,physical sensors,Maritime DeepDive,Information Extraction,data fusion,natural language processing,physical movement,Maritime,maritime piracy incidents,maritime threats,probabilistic knowledge graphs,hard data,marine safety,international maritime crime,Probabilistic logic,maritime domain,Knowledge Graph,Prototypes,graph theory,uncertainty handling,Robustness,marine engineering computing,criminal law,Relation Extraction,inference mechanisms,knowledge extraction,Uncertainty,Sensors,learning (artificial intelligence),natural language data,DeepDive,probabilistic event extraction,"
"unsupervised hierarchical methodology of maritime traffic pattern extraction for knowledge discovery","2022","Owing to the space–air–ground integrated networks (SAGIN), seaborne shipping has attracted increasing interest in the research on the motion behavior knowledge extraction and navigation pattern mining problems in the era of maritime big data for improving maritime traffic safety management. This study aims to develop a novel unsupervised methodology for feature extraction and knowledge discovery based on automatic identification system (AIS) data, allowing for seamless knowledge transfer to support trajectory data mining. The unsupervised hierarchical methodology is constructed from three parts: trajectory compression, trajectory similarity measure, and trajectory clustering. In the first part, an adaptive Douglas–Peucker with speed (ADPS) algorithm is created to preserve critical features, obtain useful information, and simplify trajectory information. Then, dynamic time warping (DTW) is utilized to measure the similarity between trajectories as the critical indicator in trajectory clustering. Finally, the improved spectral clustering with mapping (ISCM) is presented to extract vessel traffic behavior characteristics and mine movement patterns for enhancing marine safety and situational awareness. Comprehensive experiments are conducted and implemented in the Chengshan Jiao Promontory in China to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the novel methodology. Experimental results show that the proposed methodology can effectively compress the trajectories, determine the number of clusters in advance, guarantee the clustering accuracy, and extract useful navigation knowledge while significantly reducing the computational cost. The clustering results are further explored and follow the Gaussian mixture distribution, which can help provide new discriminant criteria for trajectory clustering.","Trajectory compression,Pattern extraction,Maritime traffic safety management,Knowledge discovery,Trajectory clustering,"
"a data mining method to extract traffic network for maritime transport management","2023","Maritime traffic network is essential for navigation efficiency and safety of the maritime transport system. This study proposes a framework for extracting maritime traffic network based on Automatic Identification System (AIS) data. The framework consists of maritime traffic pattern recognition, semantic routes extraction, route decomposition, and network generation. Firstly, a data-driven method is introduced to recognize ship behavior patterns and extends the single ship behaviors to regional characteristics to determine the departure-arrival areas. Then, based on the different combination of departure-arrival areas, the ship trajectories are classified to traffic groups. Subsequently, the grid-system is used to rasterize each traffic group, which realizes the fusion of trajectory data and geographic location information. Finally, to obtain the main routes and navigation channels, the extraction method is introduced by establishing the cumulative grid importance function. The main routes, together with the navigation channels, compose the maritime traffic network. The method is applied to AIS data in the Beibu Gulf, and the results show that the traffic network contains 12 stop areas, 4 entry/exit locations, 13 main routes as well as their corresponding navigation channels. It is therefore concluded that the proposed method helps (1) provide a theoretical framework to obtain and analyze the maritime traffic network and (2) enrich navigation channel identification methods for maritime transport management.","Maritime traffic network,Maritime transport management,AIS,Machine learning,Big data analytics,"

"maritime traffic probabilistic forecasting based on vesselsâ€™ waterway patterns and motion behaviors","2017","Maritime traffic prediction is critical for ocean transportation safety management. In this paper, we propose a novel knowledge assisted methodology for maritime traffic forecasting based on a vessel's waterway pattern and motion behavior. The vessel's waterway pattern is extracted through a proposed lattice-based DBSCAN algorithm that significantly reduces the problem scale, and its motion behavior is quantitatively modeled for the first time using kernel density estimation. The proposed methodology facilitates the knowledge extraction, storage, and retrieval, allowing for seamless knowledge transfer to support maritime traffic forecasting. By incorporating both the vessel's waterway pattern and motion behavior knowledge, our solution suggests a set of probable coordinates with the corresponding probability as the forecasting output. The proposed forecasting algorithm is capable of accurately predicting maritime traffic 5, 30, and 60 min ahead, while its computation can be efficiently completed in milliseconds for single vessel prediction. Owing to such a high computational efficiency, an extensive predictive analysis of hundreds of vessels has been reported for the first time in this paper.

"data mining approach to shipping route characterization and anomaly detection based on ais data","2020","A data mining approach is presented for probabilistic characterization of maritime traffic and anomaly detection. The approach automatically groups historical traffic data provided by the Automatic Identification System in terms of ship types, sizes, final destinations and other characteristics that influence the maritime traffic patterns off the continental coast of Portugal. The approach consists of identifying relevant waypoints along a route where significant changes in the ships’ navigational behaviour are observed, such as changes in heading, using trajectory compression and clustering algorithms. This provides a vector-based representation of the ship routes consisting of straight legs and connecting turning sections that facilitates route probabilistic characterization and anomaly detection. The maritime traffic is characterized probabilistically at the identified route legs and waypoints in terms of lateral distribution of the trajectories and speed profile, which allows the characterization of the typical behaviour of a group of similar ships along a particular route. In the proposed approach heading changes are automatically detected using the Douglas and Peucker algorithm and clustered by the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise algorithm. The proposed method is applied to the characterization of southbound maritime traffic from the traffic separation scheme off Cape Roca to the ports of Lisbon, Setúbal and Sines.

"vessel sailing patterns analysis from s-ais data dased on k-means clustering algorithm","2019","Automatic Identification System (AIS) provides abundant near real-time information of moving vessels in the sea of the whole world and has been widely used in the fields of vessel collision avoidance, Maritime Situation Awareness (MSA) and ocean surveillance. The development of satellite-based AIS further expands the range of AIS and enables a wide converge of AIS data collection, which solves the problem of lacking AIS data in high-seas. At the same time, AIS data provides a rich source for data mining for maritime traffic analysis. In this paper, a typical clustering algorithm called K-means is applied to deal with the Space-based AIS(S-AIS) data received by â€œTianTuo-3â€ satellite developed by National University of Defense Technology. We use Elbow Rule to determine the optimal number of clusters and calculate the normalized standard deviation of COG(Course Over Ground) and SOG(Speed Over Ground) of vessels in south Africa area as their features to conduct clustering.

"a novel network security algorithm based on improved support vector machine from smart city perspective","2018","Computer generated security concerns have become more modern and complex. Intrusion detection(ID) is a practical issue in the field of computer security whose primary objective is to detect rare attack or assaults and to ensure the security of interior systems. This paper also proposes a semi-class intrusion detection method that combines multiple classifiers to arrange exceptions and typical exercises in a computer system. The abuse detection model is constructed in the light of the decision tree learning-iterative dichotomise 3(DTL-ID3) and is assembled by utilizing the gathered data based on anomaly detection model executed by one class-support vector machine(OC-SVM). In recent years, people have paid more attention to ID/intrusion prevention system (IDS / IPS), which is closely related to the protection and utilization of system management. A few machine-learning standards including neural system, direct hereditary programming, and advanced support vector machines(ASVMs), Bayesian system, multivariate versatile relapse splines, fluffy derivation systems(FIS) and other analogical systems have been researched for the outline of intrusion detection system. In this paper, we build up an amalgam method based on DTL-ID3 and OC-SVM(A-DT and SVM) and evaluate the performance of the projected methodology by using a specific dataset and a crossover method in order to enhance the accuracy of IDS/IPS when contrasted with a singular support vector machine.","Intrusion detection system/intrusion prevention system,Data mining,One class-support vector machine,Decision tree learning-iterative dichotomise 3,"

Recent advances in long-term vessel motion modeling through Ornstein-Uhlenbeck mean-reverting stochastic processes allow to encode knowledge about maritime traffic via a compact graph-based model where waypoints are graph vertices and the connections between them, i.e., the navigational legs, are graph edges. The resulting directed graph ultimately leads to the detection and statistical characterization of recurrent maritime traffic patterns. To demonstrate its effectiveness and applicability to real-world case studies, the proposed methodology has been tested on two extensive AIS datasets, collected in the areas of two operational trials of EU-H2020's MARISA (Maritime Integrated Surveillance Awareness) project.","Ornstein-Uhlenbeck mean-reverting stochastic processes,surveillance,statistical characterization,graph vertices,Pattern-of-Life analysis,long-term vessel motion modeling,Marine vehicles,marine navigation,DBSCAN clustering,directed graph,Stochastic processes,EU-H2020 MARISA project,maritime situational awareness,graph edges,maritime integrated surveillance awareness,patterns of life,Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process,change detection,ships,recurrent maritime traffic patterns,PoL,marine engineering,stochastic processes,Automatic Identification System,low-dimensional synthetic representation,Data models,unsupervised extraction,ship routes,directed graphs,maritime traffic graph,pattern clustering,Artificial intelligence,maritime patterns,Legged locomotion,AIS datasets,Navigation,Data mining,historical automatic identification system data,graph-based model,"

This has emerged the need to the use of in-network data processing techniques which are very crucial for the success of the big data framework. This article gives overview and discussion about the state-of-the-art of the data mining and data fusion techniques designed for the WSNs. It discusses how these techniques can prepare the sensor data inside the network (in-network) before any further processing as big data. This is very important for both of the WSNs and the big data framework. For the WSNs, the in-network pre-processing techniques could lead to saving in their limited resources. For the big data side, receiving a clean, non-redundant and relevant data would reduce the excessive data volume, thus an overload reduction will be obtained at the big data processing platforms and the discovery of values from these data will be accelerated.","Data Fusion,Data Mining,Wireless Sensor Networks,Big Data,Machine learning,"

"maritime anomaly detection using gaussian process active learning","2012","A model of normal vessel behaviours is useful for detecting illegal, suspicious, or unsafe behaviour; such as vessel theft, drugs smuggling, people trafficking or poor sailing. This work presents a data-driven non-parametric Bayesian model, based on Gaussian Processes, to model normal shipping behaviour. This model is learned from Automatic Identification System (AIS) data and uses an Active Learning paradigm to select an informative subsample of the data to reduce the computational complexity of training. The resultant model allows a measure of normality to be calculated for each newly-observed transmission according to its velocity given its current latitude and longitude. Using this measure of normality, ships can be identified as potentially anomalous and prioritised for further investigation. The model performance is assessed by its ability to detect artificially generated AIS anomalies at locations around the United Kingdom. Finally, the model is demonstrated on case studies from artificial and real vessel data to detect anomalies in unusual tracks.","identification technology,data mining,automatic identification system data,data-driven nonparametric Bayesian model,Bayes methods,Marine vehicles,normal vessel behaviours,unsafe behaviour detection,informative data subsampling,Accuracy,illegal behaviour detection,Bayesian methods,sampling methods,real vessel data,Gaussian process active learning,United Kingdom,Data models,Gaussian processes,artificially generated AIS anomalies detection,maritime anomaly detection,artificial vessel data,training computational complexity,training,Training,behavioural sciences,computational complexity,normal shipping behaviour model,Computational modeling,suspicious behaviour detection,learning (artificial intelligence),newly-observed transmission,AIS data,"
"neural network-based automatic reconstruction of missing vessel trajectory data","2019","Automatic identification system (AIS) is an independent tracking system which has been widely utilized on ships to frequently broadcast the time-stamped vessel position reports. The generated massive AIS data can contribute to protecting maritime security and enhancing maritime transportation efficiency, such as maritime surveillance, anomaly detection and traffic route extraction, etc. However, the received AIS-based vessel trajectories commonly suffer from missing data due to network overload and bad weathers. To improve the quality of vessel trajectories for further researches, a two-step calculation method for vessel trajectory reconstruction is proposed in this work. In particular, the Random Forest method is introduced in the first step to automatically identify the missing position records within vessel trajectories. The missing data points could be accurately estimated from both theoretical and practical perspectives. The second step proposes a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based supervised learning method to reconstruct the vessel trajectories with missing AIS data. The LSTM-based reconstruction method is able to take full advantage of the similar geometrical features behind massive vessel trajectories.

"ship classification based on ship behavior clustering from ais data","2019","Since the introduction of the Automatic Identification System (AIS), AIS data has proven to be a valuable source of ship behavior analysis using data mining. It records ship position, speed and other behavior attributes at specific time intervals in all voyages at sea and in ports. However, the current studies in ship behavior analyze the behavior patterns either with a subjective choice of classification for behavior differences among the groups of ships or without any classification at all. In order to fill this gap, a new methodology for ship classification in ports based on behavior clustering is developed by analyzing AIS data from the port of Rotterdam. Besides a proper data preparation, the proposed methodology consists of two steps: step I, clustering ship behavior in a port area and identifying the characteristics of the clusters; step II, classifying ships to such behavior clusters based on the ship characteristics. The clustering results present both the behavior patterns and the behavior change patterns for ship path and speed over ground, which are the dominant behavior attributes for ships in ports. Some patterns of integral ship behavior can also be revealed by investigating the correlation between the two behavior attributes. Our research has shown that length and beam can be adopted as explanatory variable to classify ships to the corresponding behavior clusters. The classifiers are developed based on both unsupervised discretization (equal width binning) and supervised discretization (Chi2). The performances of classifiers are compared by three evaluation metrics, including Average Accuracy, F1score, and AUC. We found that the classification based on multi-criteria is more accurate than using a single criterion. The classifications based on Chi2 discretization outperform the ones with equal width discretization. The outcome leads to a systematic understanding of ship behavior in a port area and can be used to predict the ship behavior pattern based on their characteristics and simulate the ship behavior.","Ship classification,Ports and waterways,Behavior clustering,Data mining,AIS data,"
"context-enhanced vessel prediction based on ornstein-uhlenbeck processes using historical ais traffic patterns: real-world experimental results","2014","Traffic route analysis and prediction are both essential for maritime security. Specifically, the prediction of a vessel position is useful to provide alerts about upcoming events (e.g., opportunities and threats). However, accurate prediction along a route in the maritime domain is a challenging task, due to the complex and dynamic nature of traffic patterns. This paper presents a vessel prediction method, based on the popular Ornstein-Uhlenbeck stochastic processes, whose parameters are estimated from historical patterns of life. The historical traffic routes are obtained by pre-processing Automatic Identification System (AIS) data via the CMRE tool called Traffic Route Extraction for Anomaly Detection (TREAD). These recurrent routes allow prediction of the position of a vessel that is following one of these routes, surprisingly, by several hours. The method is validated using a case study related to the second data campaign of the EC FP7 Project New Service Capabilities for Integrated and Advanced Maritime Surveillance (NEREIDS)1.

"ship arrival prediction and its value on daily container terminal operation","2018","Effective prediction of ship arrivals should provide the estimated delay or advance of arrival ships with greater accuracy, and improve the performance of container terminal operations. Therefore, taking Gangji (Yining) Container Terminal (GYCT), China, as an example, this paper resorts to data mining approaches to predict ship arrivals and explore the value of such predicted ship arrivals on the container terminal operation. First, this study applies three data mining approaches, including Back-Propagation network (BP), Classification and Regression Tree (CART) and Random Forest (RF), to estimate the delay or advance of ship arrivals using the collected data of ship arrivals. Then the predictive performance of these three approaches is compared and discussed, it is concluded that RF performs better than BP and CART, and ETA month and ship length are the most important determinants of ship arrivals in GYCT terminal. Finally, series simulation experiments are conducted to assess the value of the ship arrivals predicted by RF model on the improvement on daily operation planning of berth allocation and quay crane assignment in the GYCT terminal. And the results show that incorporating the predicted ship arrivals by RF model is beneficial to improve the performance of operation planning of GYCT terminal.","Late/early arrivals,Berth allocation,Data mining,Arrival prediction,Container terminal operation,Quay crane assignment,"
"choose clean energy or green technology? empirical evidence from global ships","2021","On January 1st, 2020, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) implemented a new regulation for a 0.50% global sulphur cap for marine fuels, which was a dramatic decrease from the previous emissions cap of 3.5%. The new regulation will have an enormous impact on the shipping market. At present, there are different feasible schemes for reducing sulphur emissions from ships. Shipowners need to consider the economic cost, energy feasibility, and other relevant factors of different schemes before making decisions. This paper empirically explores the factors that affect shipowners' energy choices. Based on the new emerging individual ship dynamic data, Automatic Identification System (AIS), and other relevant databases, we apply various data mining methods and a threshold discrete choice model combined with an oversampling technique to conduct quantitative measurements and statistical analyses of factors for each ship type that affect the shipowners' choices. Three groups of indicators, including ship characteristics, shipowner characteristics, and market conditions, are considered in our analysis. In the model, we also address the heterogeneity of the carriers towards environmental awareness.

"discovering maritime traffic route from ais network","2016","The recent build-up network of Automatic Identification System (AIS) equipped on vessels provides a rich source of vessel movement information. AIS is originally designed for automatically exchanging navigation information, such as their unique identification, position, course, and speed, with nearby vessels and terrestrial receivers to affect collision avoidance and safety control. The collected sequences of AIS logs can be considered as maritime trajectory data, i.e., the sequences of location points with timestamps. This vast amount of AIS trajectory data can be collected and employed to achieve an awareness of maritime traffic knowledge. This paper is devoted to discovery of maritime traffic route from trajectory data generated by AIS networks. However, AIS trajectory data discovery is a challenging task because of the trajectory data is available with uncertainty. Furthermore, unlike the vehicles' movements are constrained by road networks, there is no such a sea route for vessels to follow in marine areas. To overcome the challenges, we propose a framework of Maritime Traffic Route Discovery (abbreviated as MTRD) to generate pattern-aware routes to achieve an effective understanding of maritime traffic awareness.

"a deep encoder-decoder network for anomaly detection in driving trajectory behavior under spatio-temporal context","2022","Traditional trajectory anomaly detection aims to find abnormal trajectory points or sequences using data mining techniques. As a comparison, we focus on the evaluation of the anomalies of driving habits for different drivers based on their trajectory data. This is particularly important for the application of adjusting the amount of insurance in accordance with the driving behaviors. Instead of customizing rules for modeling various driving behaviors, we propose an end-to-end deep learning framework for driving trajectory anomaly detection, called STDTB-AD. Specifically, taking into account the fact that movement is spatial–temporal dependent, the study first partitions the whole road network into a series of spatial–temporal units, which have homogeneous properties of traffic flows. Then, the motion parameters (i.e., acceleration, speed, and direction) of driving trajectories falling within each spatio-temporal unit are calculated for representing context-aware features of drivers. This method is able to detect the deviation of movement from the normal traffic state on the spatial–temporal units. Finally, a variational autoencoder is utilized to quantify the abnormity degree of each driver according to the reconstruction probability of driving feature vector. Evaluations based on taxi trajectory data show that our model can consider both the spatial and temporal contexts for detecting driving behavior anomalies and achieve higher detection accuracy than traditional models based on either spatial or temporal context.","Anomaly detection,Driving behavior,Deep learning,Trajectory data,"

We bring into account a new and influential asset - human intuition and perception - to the existing semi-automated decision support systems that mostly rely on numerical data collected by electronic sensors or cameras located either directly on the vessels or in the maritime command-and-control centers. For our project, we gathered weekly textual reports spanning twelve months from the United States Worldwide Threats to Shipping Reports repository that belongs to the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), We considered the maritime incident reports written by human operators as a valuable and accessible unstructured textual input source in which a span of text1 is called â€œriskâ€ if it expresses one of the following kinds of vessel incidents: fired, robbed, boarded, hijacked, attacked, chased, approached, kidnapped, boarding attempted, suspiciously approached or clashed with. Our approach benefits from probability distributions of some useful features annotated based on a list of lexicons that contain expressions denoting vessel types, risks types, risk associates, maritime geographical locations, dates and times. These distributions are captured and used to anchor the span of â€œrisksâ€ as they are described in the textual reports. After some preprocessing steps that include tokenization, named entity extraction and part-of-speech tagging, the textual risk mining system applies a variety of sequence classification algorithms, e.g., Conditional Random Fields, Conditional Markov Models and Hidden Markov Models in order to compare the risk classification performance.

"data imputation in iot using spatio-temporal variational auto-encoder","2023","In most Internet of Things (IoT) scenes, data missing can be unavoidable when huge number of smart devices are collecting data uninterruptedly. Therefore, data imputation can be an integral part of pre-processing before data mining. It is widely known that IoT time series show strong dependencies in both spatial and temporal dimension, and the spatial relation among the devices is in non-euclidean space. However, most machine-learning-based and deep-learning-based approaches either only take temporal features into account or only catch spatial features in euclidean space.

Specifically, two kinds of VAE are utilized. One is for calculating the adjacent matrix of device network which is the essential input of GCN, and the other is for data imputation task based on the spatial and temporal dependencies. Experiments conducted on different real-world and public datasets demonstrate that our ST-VAE can not only populate the missing spatio-temporal data accurately but also outperforms other state-of-art approaches from the whole.","VAE,IoT,GCN,GRU,Data imputation,"

"reasoning with conceptual graphs and evidential networks for multi-entity maritime threat assessment","2022","Hybrid threat events are rare and cannot be modelled solely based on data. Instead they require a focus on discovery of emergent knowledge through information sharing across agencies and systems. That requires a shared conceptualisation of the problem and entities involved. It also means that uncertain and possibly conflicting information describing multiple entities and their relationships needs to be reasoned about. In this paper we discuss the relationship between uncertain conceptual graphs and belief functions. We put forward a fusion process which allows for taking advantage of evidential reasoning capabilities in a multi-entity context. We show how information from conceptual graphs can be fed into or represented as an evidential networks and how the inference results obtained from valuation networks can be used to generate a probability distribution on conceptual graphs. This is demonstrated on a multi-entity threat assessment situation where a hybrid threat is formed by several possibly cooperating vessels.","data mining,evidential reasoning capabilities,hybrid threat events,probability distribution,emergent knowledge discovery,valuation networks,Information sharing,belief networks,information fusion,evidential networks,Cost accounting,threat assessment,Evidence theory,multientity context,shared conceptualisation,Data models,Probability distribution,fusion process,conceptual graphs,situational awareness,belief functions,graph theory,uncertainty handling,multientity threat assessment situation,marine engineering computing,inference mechanisms,information sharing,probability,possibly cooperating vessels,Cognition,multientity maritime threat assessment,Threat assessment,hybrid threats,uncertain conceptual graphs,"
"mining ship spatial trajectory patterns from ais database for maritime surveillance","2011","With the development of AIS (Automatical Identification System), more and more ships are equipped with AIS. The messages transmitted by AIS have thus become an abundant and inexpensive source of information for maritime surveillance.

With enlighten of business intelligence, Association Rules Algorithm is applied to deal with discovering the ship trajectory pattern.

"a framework for maritime anti-collision pattern discovery from ais network","2019","The avoidance of collisions between ships in encounter situations is crucial to maritime traffic safety. Most research on maritime collision avoidance has focused on planning a safe path by which to avoid approaching ships in accordance with the requirements laid out in the International Regulations for Preventing Collision at Sea (COLREGs). The resulting solution provides reference for the navigator in planning movements to avoid collisions. Nonetheless, specific anti-collision actions are generally based on the experience of the navigator. This study differed from existing works in that we sought to derive collision avoidance behavior from the trajectory data of actual ships. The Automatic Identification System (AIS) network makes it possible to collect an enormous volume of trajectory data and investigate real-world ship behavior. Unfortunately trajectory data that introduces uncertainty can hinder behavior mining for collision avoidance. Irregular and/or asynchronous location sampling can lead to situations in which the movement of a ship does not necessarily follow a given trajectory, even if its movement behavior is similar to that of other ships. In this study, we developed a framework to decipher the anti-collision behavior of ships in encounter situations from a large database of trajectory data collected by AIS network, and to present this behavior in the form of anti-collision patterns. A prototype of the proposed framework was built to enable pattern analysis and visualization functions, thereby providing a deeper understanding of collision avoidance behavior in maritime traffic. The proposed framework is applicable to the development of pattern-aware collision avoidance systems aimed at improving maritime traffic safety.","maritime conflict detection,real-world ship behavior,Safety,Marine vehicles,ship anti-collision pattern,pattern-aware collision avoidance systems,ship trajectory data,behavior mining,AIS network,ships,marine safety,maritime collision avoidance,Collision avoidance,Artificial intelligence,automatic identification system network,Trajectory,collision avoidance behavior,anti-collision behavior,International Regulations for Preventing Collision at Sea,maritime traffic safety,Navigation,collision avoidance,Data mining,maritime anti-collision pattern discovery,"
"traffic pattern detection using the hough transformation for anomaly detection to improve maritime domain awareness","2014","Techniques for extracting traffic patterns from ship position data to generate atlases of expected ocean travel are developed in this paper.

The Hough transformation is used to extract linear patterns of elevated density from the traffic density grid, which can be considered the â€œhighwaysâ€ of the oceans. These highways collectively create an atlas that is used to define geographical regions of expected ship locations. The atlas generation techniques are demonstrated using automated information system (AIS) ship position data to detect highways in both open-ocean and coastal areas.

"adaptive detection of spatial point event outliers using multilevel constrained delaunay triangulation","2016","Spatial outlier detection is a research hot spot in the field of spatial data mining. Because of the lack of specific research on spatial point events, this study presents an adaptive approach for spatial point events outlier detection (SPEOD) using multilevel constrained Delaunay triangulation. First, the spatial proximity relationships between spatial point events are roughly captured by Delaunay triangulation. Then, three-level constraints are described and used to refine spatial proximity relationships with the consideration of statistical characteristics. Finally, those spatial point events connected by remaining edges are gathered to form a series of subgraphs. Those subgraphs containing very few point events are regarded as spatial outliers. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world spatial data sets are used to show that the proposed SPEOD algorithm can detect various types of spatial point event outliers with high efficiency. Moreover, there is no need to input any parameter in SPEOD.","Spatial point events,Multilevel constrained Delaunay triangulation,Spatial outliers,"
"a comprehensive survey of clustering algorithms: state-of-the-art machine learning applications, taxonomy, challenges, and future research prospects","2022","Clustering is an essential tool in data mining research and applications. It is the subject of active research in many fields of study, such as computer science, data science, statistics, pattern recognition, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. Several clustering techniques have been proposed and implemented, and most of them successfully find excellent quality or optimal clustering results in the domains mentioned earlier. However, there has been a gradual shift in the choice of clustering methods among domain experts and practitioners alike, which is precipitated by the fact that most traditional clustering algorithms still depend on the number of clusters provided a priori. These conventional clustering algorithms cannot effectively handle real-world data clustering analysis problems where the number of clusters in data objects cannot be easily identified. Also, they cannot effectively manage problems where the optimal number of clusters for a high-dimensional dataset cannot be easily determined. Therefore, there is a need for improved, flexible, and efficient clustering techniques. Recently, a variety of efficient clustering algorithms have been proposed in the literature, and these algorithms produced good results when evaluated on real-world clustering problems. This study presents an up-to-date systematic and comprehensive review of traditional and state-of-the-art clustering techniques for different domains. This survey considers clustering from a more practical perspective. It shows the outstanding role of clustering in various disciplines, such as education, marketing, medicine, biology, and bioinformatics. It also discusses the application of clustering to different fields attracting intensive efforts among the scientific community, such as big data, artificial intelligence, and robotics. This survey paper will be beneficial for both practitioners and researchers. It will serve as a good reference point for researchers and practitioners to design improved and efficient state-of-the-art clustering algorithms.","Unsupervised learning,Optimization algorithms,Clustering algorithms,partitioning,K-Means,Hierarchical clustering,Data mining,Automatic clustering,Machine learning,Clustering,Supervised learning,"

Spatial Online Analytical Processing (SOLAP) emerged to perform data mining on spatial and temporal data that naturally contains the hierarchical structure used in many complex applications. In addition, uncertainty and fuzziness are inherently essential elements of data in many complex data applications, particularly in spatial–temporal database applications. In this study, FSOLAP is proposed as a new fuzzy SOLAP-based framework to compose the benefits of fuzzy logic and SOLAP concepts and is extended with inference capability to the framework to support predictive analytics. The predictive accuracy and resource utilization performance of FSOLAP are compared using real data with some well-known machine learning techniques such as Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, and Fuzzy Random Forest.

"the promises and perils of automatic identification system data","2021","Automatic Identification System (AIS) is used to identify vessels in maritime navigation. Currently, it is used for various commercial purposes. However, the abundance and lack of quality of AIS data make it difficult to capitalize on its value. Therefore, an understanding of both the limitations of AIS data and the opportunities is important to maximize its value, but these have not been clearly stated in the existing literature. This study aims to help researchers and practitioners understand AIS data by identifying both the promises and perils of AIS data. We identify the different applications and limitations of AIS data in the literature and build upon them in a sequential mixed-design study. We first identify the promises and perils that exist in the literature. We then analyze AIS data from the port of Amsterdam quantitatively to detect noise and to find the perils researchers and practitioners could encounter. Our results incorporate quantitative findings with qualitative insights obtained from interviewing domain experts. This study extends the literature by considering multiple limitations of AIS data across different domains at the same time. Our results show that the amount of noise in AIS data depends on factors such as the equipment used, external factors, humans, dense traffic etc. The contribution that our paper makes is in combining and making a comprehensive list of both the promises and perils of AIS data. Consequently, this study helps researchers and practitioners to (i) identify the sources of noise, (ii) to reduce the noise in AIS data and (iii) use it for the benefits of their research or the optimization of their operations.","Ship behavior analysis,Advanced applications of AIS data,Navigation safety,Environmental evaluation,Data mining,AIS data,"
"a framework for discovering maritime traffic conflict from ais network","2017","Thanks for the common use of Automatic Identification System (AIS) network has made a large number of the maritime traffic data to be available. Ships equipped with AIS automatically exchange navigational information with nearby ships and terrestrial AIS receivers to facilitate the tracking and monitoring of ships' location and movement for collision avoidance and control. Obviously, with increasing amount of maritime shipping traffic, the navigational collisions are one of the growing safety concerns in maritime traffic situation awareness. To understand the collision situations can help the maritime traffic managers to improve the safety control of maritime traffic. However, it is difficult to statistically analyze such collision due to the number of collected real cases of collisions are relatively low within a short period of time. To overcome the problem of low sample size, we discover traffic conflict from data collected by AIS network to substitute the real collision. Given a set of maritime traffic data collected from AIS network, we try to discover ships' movements that have conflict behaviors and these behaviors may bring a possible collision if they do not take any evasive action. We propose a framework of Clustering-and-Detection to automatically discover the clusters of conflict trajectory from AIS trajectory data in an unsupervised way. Based on real AIS data, the experimental results show that the proposed framework is able to effectively discover sets of trajectory with conflict situation from maritime AIS traffic data.

"dltif: deep learning-driven cyber threat intelligence modeling and identification framework in iot-enabled maritime transportation systems","2023","The recent burgeoning of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies in the maritime industry is successfully digitalizing Maritime Transportation Systems (MTS). In IoT-enabled MTS, the smart maritime objects, infrastructure associated with ship or port communicate wirelessly using an open channel Internet. The intercommunication and incorporation of heterogeneous technologies in IoT-enabled MTS brings opportunities not only for the industries that embrace it, but also for cyber-criminals. Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) is an effective security strategy that uses artificial intelligence models to understand cyber-attacks and can protect data of IoT-enabled MTS proficiently. Unsurprisingly, most of the existing CTI-based solutions uses manual analysis to extract relevant threat information, and has low detection and high false alarm rate. Therefore, to tackle aforementioned challenges, an automated framework called DLTIF is developed for modeling cyber threat intelligence and identifying threat types. The proposed DLTIF is based on three schemes: a deep feature extractor (DFE), CTI-driven detection (CTIDD) and CTI-attack type identification (CTIATI). The DFE scheme automatically extracts the hidden patterns of IoT-enabled MTS network and its output is used by CTIDD scheme for threat detection. The CTIATI scheme is designed to identify the exact threat types and to assist security analysts in giving early warning and adopt defensive strategies.

"background modeling combined with multiple features in the fourier domain for maritime infrared target detection","2022","To detect ship targets in dynamic sea backgrounds, a robust foreground detection method based on background modeling combined with multiple features in the Fourier domain (BMMFF) is proposed. Because the fluctuation of seawater is similar to a sine wave, the amplitude spectrum of the seawater in the Fourier domain has strong energy concentration, and the background model is built in the Fourier domain. The local statistical characteristics can effectively reflect the properties of a specific position, and the target frequency points are extracted by comparing the local statistical characteristic differences between the amplitude spectrum of the test frame and the updated background. Additionally, two different strategies are used to update the background for cases with or without sudden waves in two adjacent test frames. When the target and seawater have different contrast in different scenes, the threshold is set according to the seawaterâ€™s fluctuation degree, which is classified into three different levels in the training stage. Moreover, the linear correlation feature between the test frame and the updated background and the oscillation feature of the test frameâ€™s amplitude spectrum are proposed in the Fourier domain, which can better segment targets in relatively calm and violent sea scenes, respectively. Thus, the two features are combined with the background model with a reasonable strategy to further improve the detection accuracy. The experimental results demonstrate that BMMFF outperforms related comparison algorithms in different challenging sea scenes. The average false alarm rate of BMMFF is reduced by approximately 30% in the case where its average detection rate is similar to that of other algorithms.","target frequency points,linear correlation feature,Marine vehicles,Feature extraction,seawater,sea scenes,statistical analysis,dynamic sea backgrounds,ships,marine engineering,background modeling,object detection,ship targets,Oscillators,feature extraction,Correlation,Adaptation models,foreground detection method,infrared imaging,Dual-mode sea background model,local statistical characteristic differences,Object detection,image segmentation,Data mining,oscillation feature,Fourier domain,maritime infrared target detection,"

A retrospective marine epidemiological approach was developed to demonstrate that marine morbidity, mortality, and disease information is recoverable by keyword searching of academic journals and through the retrieval of publicly available digital and print-media information. Observational records compiled from disturbances occurring within the Northwestern Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, and Caribbean Sea confirm that anomalous marine morbidity and mortality events have increased in number and frequency during the last 30 years.

"research on prediction of link embedding in maritime knowledge graph","2021","The knowledge graph is essentially a multi-relational network, which uses a structured method to store the knowledge system of the corresponding relationships between entities in the real world. It is a structured representation of the real world and brings new technical means to the knowledge representation of the maritime world. However, the data is often incomplete, missing many nodes or links, because they may be only a small part of all based on credible facts. We can solve this problem by predicting missing links. Recent studies on multi-hop KGQA try to use relevant external text to deal with KG sparsity, this method still has relatively large limitations. In another study, a KG embedding method has been proposed to reduce KG sparsity by performing missing link prediction.","data mining,Link prediction,structured representation,structured method,performing missing link prediction,knowledge representation,KG embedding method,maritime world,knowledge system,multirelational network,missing links,maritime knowledge graph,Knowledge based systems,Knowledge representation,Knowledge Graph,network theory (graphs),graph theory,relevant external text,relatively large limitations,KG embedding,text analysis,credible facts,Information and communication technology,corresponding relationships,"
"ais event-based knowledge discovery for maritime situational awareness","2016","The discovery of anomalies and, more in general, of events of interest at sea is one of the main challenges of Maritime Situational Awareness. This paper introduces an event-based methodology for knowledge discovery without querying directly a large volume of raw data. The proposed architecture analyses the maritime traffic data to detect maritime traffic patterns and events and aggregate them in an Event Map, namely a georeferenced grid. The Event Map offers visualisation capabilities and, more importantly, is used as access interface to the maritime traffic knowledge database. The proposed methodology offers real-time access to the extracted maritime knowledge, and the possibility to perform more structured queries with respect to traditional basic queries (e. g. vessel proximity within a certain distance). The proposed approach is demonstrated and assessed using real-world Automatic Identification System (AIS) data, revealing computational improvements and enriched monitoring capabilities.","data mining,event detection,anomaly detection,Marine vehicles,Monitoring,data visualisation,data visualisation capabilities,event map,AIS event-based knowledge discovery,maritime situational awareness,data analysis,anomaly discovery,automatic identification system,Knowledge discovery,marine engineering,AIS,maritime surveillance,maritime traffic data analysis,maritime traffic knowledge database,georeferenced grid,Data visualization,Trajectory,Visualization,knowledge discovery,"
"a distributed spatial method for modeling maritime routes","2020","In this work we propose a novel spatial knowledge discovery pipeline capable of automatically unravelling the â€œroads of the seaâ€ and maritime traffic patterns by analysing voluminous vessel tracking data, as collected through the Automatic Identification System (AIS). We present a computationally efficient and highly accurate solution, based on a MapReduce approach and unsupervised learning methods, capable of identifying the spatiotemporal dynamics of ship routes and most crucially their characteristics, thus deriving maritime â€œpatterns of lifeâ€ at a global scale, without the reliance on any additional information sources or a priori expert knowledge. Experimental results confirm high accuracy of results and superior performance in comparison to other methods, with the entire processing duration completing in less than 3 hours for more than a terabyte of non-uniform spatial data. Finally, to clearly demonstrate the applicability and impact of our proposed method, we evaluate its ability to detect real world â€œanomaliesâ€, such as maritime incidents reported in the European Marine Casualty Information Platform.

"traffic pattern mining and forecasting technologies in maritime traffic service networks: a comprehensive survey","2020","Maritime traffic service networks and information systems play a vital role in maritime traffic safety management. The data collected from the maritime traffic networks are essential for the perception of traffic dynamics and predictive traffic regulation. This paper is devoted to surveying the key processing components in maritime traffic networks. Specifically, the latest progress on maritime traffic data mining technologies for maritime traffic pattern extraction and the recent effort on vessels' motion forecasting for better situation awareness are reviewed. Through the review, we highlight that the traffic pattern knowledge presents valued insights for wide-spectrum domain application purposes, and serves as a prerequisite for the knowledge based forecasting techniques that are growing in popularity.

"a new detection method for ldos attacks based on data mining","2022","The serving capabilities of networks are reduced by low-rate denial of service (LDoS) attacks that periodically send high-intensity pulse data flows. This type of attack shows a harmful effect similar to that of traditional DoS attacks, but their attack modes differ greatly. The high concealment of LDoS attacks makes it extremely difficult for traditional DoS detection methods to detect LDoS attacks. Meanwhile, the state-of-art detection methods for LDoS attacks have low-efficiency and resource-intensive and time complexity issues. We propose a novel detection method with analysis of abnormal network traffic under LDoS attacks that combines data mining technology. The judgement benchmarks were also established. The results from the experimental simulation on the simulated environment, physical environment and public datasets prove that the developed method can effectively detect LDoS attacks with optimal detection cost and low complexity, and has a high accuracy, a low false-negative rate, and a low false-positive rate.","Low-rate denial of service (LDoS),Histogram,Frequency distribution,Abnormal traffic,Adaptive exponentially weighted moving average (AEWMA) control chart,Data mining,"
"a comparative research of machine learning impact to future of maritime transportation","2019","Machine Learning (ML) can be defined as a level of algorithm which may allow software applications to create more accurate in forecasting outputs without being external programmed. Since maritime transportation requires smart technologies, adaptation of machine learning tools might provide utmost benefit for efficiency, sustainability and reduction of operational costs. As the data is core element to unlocking the uncertainty, it may help to improve shipping. So far, the data acquisition on maritime transportation is quite limited. Therefore, adaptation of machine learning techniques in the maritime transportation is narrow as compared to other industries. The aim of this paper is to discuss machine learning applications and their impacts to future of maritime transportation industry. A sets of comparative researches will be undertaken to present current situation and potential impacts to future in maritime transportation. With the help of this research, the maritime practitioners and professionals will gain an idea on focusing appropriate algorithm for a specific shipping problem such as voyage optimization and economics, sustainability of transportation, controlling of freight rates, maintenance forecasting, digitalization on bridge and engine control room, etc.","maritime transportation,Machine learning,data mining,"
"ais big data framework for maritime safety supervision","2020","Under the pattern of rapid shipping industry development, the extensive application of the AIS data in maritime safety supervision has created gradually increased space-time data of ship. However, although the shipping industry has a massive amount of data, there are obvious shortcomings in data storage and data mining, which make it difficult to effectively use data to guide maritime safety supervision. In view of this, we build an innovation â€˜CIPSODARâ€™ framework, which covers AIS big data technical stack system on Hadoop cluster, including AIS big data processing, AIS big data storage and query, as well as AIS big data mining. Particularly, in the data mining phase, the OD segmentation algorithm, which enables to dispose the typical ship track problems of maritime safety supervision is proposed and realized. Thus, this research result shows that AIS big data is valuable in terms of maritime safety supervision, after systematically combing AIS big data via â€˜CIPSODARâ€™ framework and using OD segmentation algorithm to deal with AIS big data ship track problems.","Maritime Safety Supervision,data mining,AIS Big Data storage,OD Segmentation Algorithm,Safety,Industries,HBase,rapid shipping industry development,OD segmentation algorithm,AIS Big Data,AIS Big Data mining,Technical Stack,ship space-time data,ships,AIS Big Data technical stack system,marine safety,marine engineering,storage management,Data Mining,pattern clustering,maritime safety supervision,Memory,Big Data,Hadoop,AIS Big Data ship track problems,parallel processing,innovation CIPSODAR framework,Navigation,Data mining,Technological innovation,data handling,query processing,"

For the purpose of this classification, it is proposed to use clustering, the method developed within the framework of this study. The peculiarity of the method is to take into account the specifics of presenting data on the routes of vessel traffic in the information and telecommunication system of the marine security. This specificity is considered in the routing metric and features of the route clusters formation as well as their centers localization. Such data analysis in the marine surface monitoring system will allow the problem of risk assessment to get solved by detecting spatial anomalies in the routes of vessel traffic.","data mining,Telecommunications,vessel route clustering,marine security,Monitoring,Mathematical model,maritime border guard,maritime security,marine surface monitoring system,data classification,data analysis,route clusters formation,ships,marine safety,pattern classification,Sea surface,Measurement,metric,clustering,traffic engineering computing,Task analysis,information and telecommunication system,Linear approximation,route,telecommunication system,"
"a generic anomaly detection approach applied to mixture-of-unigrams and maritime surveillance data","2019","This paper proposes a new generic method to detect anomalies (i.e., statistical outliers) which can be used with a generative topic model. In this paper, we specify this method in the context of the Mixture-of-unigrams model, which is widely used in text mining. It is possible to detect anomalies with a topic model by applying a threshold to the likelihood. However, it is challenging to choose the threshold since the choice needs to consider both the similarities of the topics and the length of documents. This paper describes a new intuitive method to detect anomalies which simply manipulates the output of the trained model. Such an approach is anticipated to have parameters that are more intuitive to define for a given problem. To assess the utility of the proposed approach, we also present a use case involving identifying ships misreporting their ship-type using geo-location data from the Automatic Identification System (AIS) messages. We show that, if we train a model using data for one type of ship, it is possible to identify ships of another type as anomalous.","geo-location data,data mining,Anomaly detection,Mixture-of-unigrams model,Marine vehicles,natural language processing,security of data,trained model,generic anomaly detection,ships,automatic identification system,marine engineering,text mining,generative topic model,Training data,Data models,statistical outliers,intuitive method,Artificial intelligence,Training,text analysis,Probability,maritime surveillance data,learning (artificial intelligence),"
