"fast cnn surveillance pipeline for fine-grained vessel classification and detection in maritime scenarios","2016","Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have proven very effective for many vision benchmarks in object detection and classification tasks. However, the computational complexity and object resolution requirements of CNNs limit their applicability in wide-view video surveillance settings where objects are small. This paper presents a CNN surveillance pipeline for vessel localization and classification in maritime video. The proposed pipeline is build upon the GPU implementation of Fast-R-CNN with three main steps:(1) Vessel filtering and regions proposal using low-cost weak object detectors based on hand-engineered features. (2) Deep CNN features of the candidates regions are computed with one feed-forward pass from the high-level layer of a fine-tuned VGG16 network. (3) Fine-grained classification is performed using CNN features and a support vector machine classifier with linear kernel for object verification. The performance of the proposed pipeline is compared with other popular CNN architectures with respect to detection accuracy and evaluation speed. The proposed approach mAP of 61.10% was the comparable with Fast-R-CNN but with a 10Ã— speed up (on the order of Faster-R-CNN) on the new Annapolis Maritime Surveillance Dataset.","Pipelines,Support vector machines,object verification,Feature extraction,maritime video,maritime scenarios,neural nets,GPU,linear kernel,fine-grained vessel detection,fine-grained vessel classification,support vector machines,deep convolutional neural networks,pipelines,Proposals,object detection,image classification,feed-forward pass,support vector machine classifier,fast-R-CNN,Object detection,Surveillance,fast CNN surveillance pipeline,VGG16 network,Detectors,Annapolis maritime surveillance dataset,"
"rep-enhancer: re-parameterizing neural network for real-time low-light enhancement in visual maritime surveillance","2022","Vision-based maritime surveillance has become an essential part of the vessel traffic services system. The images collected in low-light maritime conditions often suffer from poor visibility. These images may significantly degenerate the performance of high-level visual tasks and increase the uncertainty in maritime surveillance. To address this problem, we propose a lightweight neural network (Rep-Enhancer) for low-light image enhancement. Specifically, we first design a re-parameterizable multi-branch edge extraction module, i.e., spatial domain-oriented convolution block (SDCB). Furthermore, skip connections and spatial attention operations are employed to strengthen the features. By exploiting these well-strengthened edge features, we can enhance the low-light images effectively with the encoder-decoder structure. The experimental results have shown that Rep-Enhancer can enhance the low-light image qualifiedly while maintaining great inference efficiency.","Traffic control,Image edge detection,surveillance,low-light images,low-light,Image enhancement,vessel traffic services system,lightweight neural network,high-level visual tasks,Rep-Enhancer,Feature extraction,image enhancement,Neural networks,edge detection,Visual effects,well-strengthened edge features,low-light maritime conditions,edge feature,maritime surveillance,computer vision,object detection,re-parameterization,multibranch edge extraction module,feature extraction,real-time low-light enhancement,visual maritime surveillance,spatial domain-oriented convolution block,low-light image enhancement,convolutional neural nets,Uncertainty,Surveillance,vision-based maritime surveillance,"
"statistical performance of classifiers for a maritime atr task","2008","This research explores the statistical performance of several classifiers (Bayes, nearest neighbor, and a neural network) on a maritime ATR problem. The features employed were derived from range profiles and inspired by the physical structure of the ship targets to maximize the generalizability of the classifiers. The ship targets were created using Pro Engineer (parametric technology corporation), facetized, and input into XPATCH. XPATCH was used to create range profiles from 0 to 30 degree aspect. A likelihood based confidence measure was employed to force the classifiers to output at 98% confidence. The confidence measure was based on a discriminant that was the distance between a classifier output and a template.","marine radar,ship target,Marine vehicles,Monitoring,Sea measurements,classifier statistical performance,ocean monitoring,ships,Oceans,Sea surface,search radar,Statistics,Nearest neighbor searches,maritime surveillance radar,Boats,likelihood based confidence measure,Force measurement,maritime ATR task,Surveillance,oceanographic techniques,"
"a semi-supervised deep learning approach for vessel trajectory classification based on ais data","2022","Automatic identification system (AIS) refers to a new type of navigation aid system equipped in maritime vehicles to monitor ship performance. It provides trajectory information of vessels which can be used for the classification task. The classification results facilitate ocean surveillance and conservation, vessel management enhancement, fishery regulation, marine ecological sustainability, and nautical safety protection. Some progresses have been made based on machine learning or deep learning strategies to perform supervised learning by assuming that during the training process, the category labels of historical trajectory data are available. However, in reality, the label information may be difficult or expensive to obtain, resulting in that only a small part of the training data is labeled, and most of the training data is unlabeled. To address this issue, this paper proposes a semi-supervised deep learning approach to integrate the knowledge of unlabeled data for vessel trajectory classification. Here, we call our approach SSL-VTC. Specifically, we first extract vessel trajectories by integrating the kinematic and static information from historical AIS messages. Then, we design convolutional neural networks to extract feature representations from the vessel trajectories. Finally, we develop a semi-supervised learning algorithm based on the variational autoencoder to perform discriminative learning and generative learning simultaneously. In this way, our SSL-VTC framework can fully leverage the labeled data and unlabeled data during the training process. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to utilize semi-supervised learning for vessel trajectory classification. Experimental results on the public AIS dataset show that our SSL-VTC can effectively extract feature representations from the AIS messages and its performance is significantly better than the traditional supervised learning methods. The approach and findings of this study provide important implications for researchers and stakeholders in the field of ocean management.","Vessel trajectory classification,Variational autoencoder,Deep learning,Semi-supervised learning,Automatic identification system,"

"a comparative investigation of data-driven approaches based on one-class classifiers for condition monitoring of marine machinery system","2020","The safety and reliability of ship navigation depend heavily on the performance of the marine machinery system, which can be maintained at a high level by condition based maintenance. Intelligent condition monitoring is the key to achieve condition based maintenance. However, it is not easy to realize intelligent condition monitoring in a real ship, because there are not enough labeled fault samples to train an accurate detection model. In fact, the potential value of a large number of normal samples collected by the shipboard monitoring system has not been mined out. Since one-class classifiers only need one-class samples to train the detection models, they are very suitable for such occasions. In this paper, we investigate the performance of several representative one-class classifiers, such as OCSVM (One class support vector machine), SVDD (Support vector data description), GKNN (Global k-nearest neighbors), LOF (Local outlier factor), IForest (Isolation forest) and ABOD (Angle-based outlier detection), in condition monitoring of the marine machinery system. The dataset of a marine gas turbine propulsion system is used for a case study, which is a simulation dataset verified by the real ship data. Compared with previous literatures, our new work is to investigate the performance of a variety of key one-class classifiers, not only considering the common evaluation indexes for machine learning, but also considering the sample combinations of the training dataset, distribution of misclassified samples, and the tolerance to contaminated data. The experimental results show that these algorithms have good performance in the dataset in some common evaluation indexes. However, they show some obvious performance differences in some novel evaluation indexes we proposed. This can provide decision support for the application of one-class classifiers in the condition monitoring of many other marine machinery systems.","One-class classifier,Marine machinery,Condition based maintenance,Condition monitoring,"
"a mapping approach for controlling different maritime cranes and robots using ann","2014","In [1], a flexible and general control system architecture that allows for modelling, simulation and control of different models of maritime cranes and, more generally, robotic arms was previously presented by our research group. Each manipulator can be controlled by using the same universal input device regardless of differences in size, kinematic structure, degrees of freedom (DOFs), body morphology, constraints and affordances. The architecture presented establishes the base for the research of a flexible mapping procedure between a universal input device and the manipulators to be controlled, which is the topic of this paper. Based on the same architecture, as a validating case study, a new method for implementing such a mapping algorithm is introduced in this paper. This method is based on the use of Artificial Neural Networks. Using this approach, the system is able to automatically learn the inverse kinematic properties of different models. Learning is done iteratively based only on observation of input-output relationship, unlike most other control schemes. Related simulations are carried out to validate the efficiency of the proposed mapping method.","Kinematics,inverse kinematic properties,manipulator kinematics,manipulators,ANN,maritime cranes,Cranes,neurocontrollers,flexible mapping procedure,control system architecture,marine engineering,Artificial neural networks,learning,mapping approach,Joints,Manipulators,Artificial Neural Networks,manipulator,input-output relationship,Visualization,learning (artificial intelligence),artificial neural networks,Control architecture,robotic arms,"
"ship detection in maritime surveillance system based on yolox","2023","In this paper, we study the problem of ship target detection in maritime video surveillance systems, with special attention to the detection accuracy and adaptability under bad weather conditions. To this end, we propose an improved ship target detection method, including the addition of additive attention mechanism, and through testing on ship data sets, we verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. To further evaluate the performance of the method in severe weather conditions, we also used a flexible data enhancement strategy to generate a diverse synthetic test datasets, including different conditions such as rain, fog, and low illumination. Based on this datasets, we constructed a test datasets specifically for small vessel target detection, in which we evaluated the proposed approach. Experimental results show that compared with other mainstream competing algorithms such as Faster R-CNN, YOLOv3, YOLOv4, and YOLOX, our method has superior performance in terms of detection accuracy, robustness, and efficiency. In addition, the proposed method proves its good adaptability in ship detection under harsh imaging conditions.

"a ship movement classification based on automatic identification system (ais) data using convolutional neural network","2020","With a wide use of AIS data in maritime transportation, there is an increasing demand to develop algorithms to efficiently classify a ship’s AIS data into different movements (static, normal navigation and manoeuvring). To achieve this, several studies have been proposed to use labelled features but with the drawback of not being able to effectively extract the details of ship movement information. In addition, a ship movement is in a free space, which is different to a road vehicle’s movement in road grids, making it inconvenient to directly migrate the methods for GPS data classification into AIS data. To deal with these problems, a Convolutional Neural Network-Ship Movement Modes Classification (CNN-SMMC) algorithm is proposed in this paper. The underlying concept of this method is to train a neural network to learn from the labelled AIS data, and the unlabelled AIS data can be effectively classified by using this trained network. More specifically, a Ship Movement Image Generation and Labelling (SMIGL) algorithm is first designed to convert a ship’s AIS trajectories into different movement images to make a full use of the CNN’s classification ability. Then, a CNN-SMMC architecture is built with a series of functional layers (convolutional layer, max-pooling layer, dense layer etc.) for ship movement classification with seven experiments been designed to find the optimal parameters for the CNN-SMMC. Considering the imbalanced features of AIS data, three metrics (average accuracy, F1 score and Area Under Curve (AUC)) are selected to evaluate the performance of the CNN-SMMC. Finally, several benchmark classification algorithms (K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Decision Tree (DT)) are selected to compare with CNN-SMMC. The results demonstrate that the proposed CNN-SMMC has a better performance in the classification of AIS data.","Trajectory image,AUtomatic Identification System (AIS),Ship movement classification,Convolutional Neural Network (CNN),"
"research on ship abnormal behavior detection method based on graph neural network","2022","Because of the existing maritime intelligent supervision, ship abnormal behavior detection ignores the interdependence between different time series of ships and different abnormal behavior characteristics, which leads to poor real-time performance and limited detection accuracy of abnormal detection.

This mechanism uses a sliding window to generate fixed data input, uses graph attention network to capture the dependence between ship behavior characteristics, and determines the threshold of anomaly according to the sea environment set in this paper.

"a novel model for ship trajectory anomaly detection based on gaussian mixture variational autoencoder","2023","The use of traditional methods in anomaly detection of multi-class ship trajectories showed some limitations in terms of robustness and learning ability of trajectory features. In view of this, an anomaly detection model for ship trajectory data based on Gaussian Mixture Variational Autoencoder (GMVAE) is proposed in this study using an unsupervised classification method. The proposed model modifies Variational Autoencoder (VAE) by changing the inferential distribution of prior distribution and approximate posterior to the Gaussian mixture model. A high-dimensional hidden space is constructed to learn the features of multi-class trajectory data, and the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) method is applied to measure the error between the reconstructed trajectory and the original trajectory in order to judge whether the ship trajectory is abnormal. The Automatic Identification System (AIS) data from the US coastal areas are used to verify the proposed model, and the results are compared with other commonly used models in a manually labeled dataset. The research results indicate that the detection rate of the proposed model is 91.26%, and the false alarm rate is 0.68%, which performs the best. Using the Gaussian mixture model to describe the distribution of hidden space can improve the learning ability of multi-class trajectories of VAE, thus increasing the robustness of the model. This research can provide technical support for ship trajectory data analysis and risk management of maritime transportation.","Trajectory,anomaly detection of ship trajectory,Clustering algorithms,Classification algorithms,Mathematical models,gaussian mixture variational autoencoder (gmvae),unsupervised learning,Gaussian distribution,Marine vehicles,Artificial neural networks,intelligent transportation,AIS,"

These datasets provide detailed insights into the patterns vessels follow, while safely navigating across the globe, under various conditions. In this paper, we develop an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) capable of predicting a vessels future behaviour (position, speed and course), based on events that occur in a predictable pattern, across large map areas. The main concept of this study is to determine if an ANN is capable of inferring the unique behavioural patterns that each vessel follows and successively use this as a means for predicting multiple vessel behaviour into a future point in time.

"towards a convolutional neural network model for classifying regional ship collision risk levels for waterway risk analysis","2020","Estimating the navigational risk of vessels operating in sea and waterway areas is important for waterway risk management and pollution preparedness and response planning. Existing methods relying on a model-informed expert judgment of ship-ship collision risk are of limited practical use because periodic risk monitoring is feasible only when this can be done without extensive use of organizational resources. To alleviate such limitations, this article presents a new approach based Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and image recognition to interpret and classify ship-ship collision risks in encounter scenarios. The specific aim of the article is to investigate whether a CNN-based model can quickly and accurately interpret images constructed based on data from the Automatic Identification System (AIS) in terms of collision risk. To test this, estimates derived from training data are compared to validation data. It is also investigated whether adding additional navigational information based on AIS data improves the model's predictive accuracy. A case study with data from the Baltic Sea area is implemented, where various model design alternatives are tested as a proof-of-concept. The main finding of this work is that a CNN-based approach can indeed meet the specified design requirements, suggesting that this is a fruitful direction for future work.

"new frontiers in the risk assessment of ship collision","2023","Navigation is becoming more and more complex over the years. The increase in maritime traffic and vessel size is inducing a global escalation of ship collision accidents, with consequent losses of human lives and economic assets worth billions. This is particularly true for port basins, with maritime authorities struggling worldwide to keep up with the ever-increasing ship traffic. In this respect, the demand for advanced methods to assess and mitigate ship collision risk has never been higher. The interdependency between physical failures, weather conditions, logistics, governance and human factors requires sophisticated frameworks to effectively assist maritime authorities and navigators in decision-making. The present work reviews the most recent advancements in the risk assessment of ship collision.

"adaptive ship-radiated noise recognition with learnable fine-grained wavelet transform","2022","Analyzing the ocean acoustic environment is a tricky task. Background noise and variable channel transmission environment make it complicated to implement accurate ship-radiated noise recognition. Existing recognition systems are weak in addressing the variable underwater environment, thus leading to disappointing performance in practical application. In order to keep the recognition system robust in various underwater environments, this work proposes an adaptive generalized recognition system — AGNet (Adaptive Generalized Network). By converting fixed wavelet parameters into fine-grained learnable parameters, AGNet learns the characteristics of underwater sound at different frequencies. Its flexible and fine-grained design is conducive to capturing more background acoustic information (e.g., background noise, underwater transmission channel). To utilize the implicit information in wavelet spectrograms, AGNet adopts the convolutional neural network with parallel convolution attention modules as the classifier. Experiments reveal that our AGNet outperforms all baseline methods on several underwater acoustic datasets, and AGNet could benefit more from transfer learning.

"nonlinear predictive control for the management of container flows in maritime intermodal terminals","2008","The increase of efficiency in the management of container terminals is addressed via a predictive control approach to allocate the available handling resources. The predictive control action results from the minimization of a performance cost function that measures the lay times of carriers over a forward horizon. Such an approach to predictive control is based on a model of container flows inside a terminal as a system of queues. Binary variables are included into the model to represent the events of departure or stay of a carrier, thus the proposed approach requires the on-line solution of a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem. Two techniques for solving such a problem are proposed that account for the presence of binary variables as well as nonlinearities into the model and the cost function. The first relies on the application of a standard branch-and-bound algorithm. The second is based on the idea of dealing with the decisions associated with the binary variables as step functions. In this case, real nonlinear programming techniques are used to find a solution. Finally, a third approach is proposed that is based on the idea of approximating off line the feedback control laws that result from the application of the two previous approaches.

"maritime uav patrol tasks based on yolov4 object detection","2022","The search and rescue operations conducted by designated maritime patrol troops usually employ ships and helicopters in their search and rescue work at sea, making it a resource-intensive undertaking both in terms of patrolling equipment and trained personnel. Oftentimes, when the victims send an SOS or call for help, the rescue unit in question can easily obtain the ship's information but cannot access prevailing maritime images of the sea, thus hindering them from swiftly controlling the accident site as effectively. This work endeavors to address this deficiency and proposes an automated patrolling operation based on small UAVs and a diverse set of maritime search patterns corresponding to different sea areas. Maritime images are collected via a deep neural network-based UAV and promptly returned to the search and rescue system. The object detection model in this case is trained using extensive images of maritime accidents collected from the network. This object detection model based on the YOLOv4 framework is thus used in the timely detection of maritime accidents. Post detection, an alarm system is set up to classify the danger level of the targets and to trigger rescue operations corresponding to the level of danger, followed by an alarm message sent to the rescuers by Short Message Service (SMS). The proposed system has been found to detect humans in the sea and at ship collision sites with an accuracy of 94.20% (mAP), which is 11% more accurate than the Single Shot MultiBox Detector.","designated maritime patrol troops,emergency management,deep learning (artificial intelligence),object detection model,deep neural network-based UAV,Personnel,Search problems,patrolling equipment,alarm systems,Message services,extensive images,detect humans,maritime UAV patrol tasks,alarm system,rescue work,YOLOv4 object detection,Helicopters,ships,resource-intensive,marine safety,rescue operations,post detection,object detection,maritime images,Autonomous aerial vehicles,maritime search patterns,rescue system,trained personnel,autonomous aerial vehicles,different sea areas,accident site,Object Detection,YOLOv4 framework,helicopters,automated patrolling operation,Maritime Search and Rescue,Object detection,traffic engineering computing,Scientific computing,ship collision sites,maritime accidents,rescue unit,Unmanned Aerial Vehicles,UAVs,"

"machine learning-assisted anomaly detection in maritime navigation using ais data","2020","The automatic identification system (AIS) reports vessels' static and dynamic information, which are essential for maritime traffic situation awareness. However, AIS transponders can be switched off to hide suspicious activities, such as illegal fishing, or piracy. Therefore, this paper uses real world AIS data to analyze the possibility of successful detection of various anomalies in the maritime domain. We propose a multi-class artificial neural network (ANN)-based anomaly detection framework to classify intentional and non-intentional AIS on-off switching anomalies. The multi-class anomaly framework captures AIS message dropouts due to various reasons, e.g., channel effects or intentional one for carrying illegal activities. We extract position, speed, course and timing information from real world AIS data, and use them to train a 2-class (normal and anomaly) and a 3-class (normal, power outage and anomaly) anomaly detection models. Our results show that the models achieve around 99.9% overall accuracy, and are able to classify a test sample in the order of microseconds.","security of data,maritime traffic situation awareness,multiclass anomaly framework,pattern classification,multiclass artificial neural network,AIS message dropouts,neural nets,illegal fishing,learning (artificial intelligence),illegal activities,ships,automatic identification system,marine engineering,machine learning-assisted anomaly detection,maritime navigation,AIS transponders,"
"an enhanced lightweight convolutional neural network for ship detection in maritime surveillance system","2022","With the extensive application of artificial intelligence, ship detection from optical satellite remote sensing images using deep learning technology can significantly improve detection accuracy. However, the existing methods usually have complex models and huge computations, which makes them difficult to deploy on resource-constrained devices, such as satellites. To solve this problem, this article proposes an enhanced lightweight ship detection model called ShipDetectionNet to replace the standard convolution with improved convolution units. The improved convolution unit is implemented by applying depthwise separable convolution to replace standard convolution and further using the pointwise group convolution to replace the point convolution in depthwise separable convolution. In addition, the attention mechanism is incorporated into the convolution unit to ensure detection accuracy. Compared to the latest YOLOv5s, our model has a comparable performance in mean average precision, while the number of parameters and the model size are reduced by 14.18% and 13.14%, respectively.

This has led to the development of new techniques to better isolate targets from the background sea clutter. In this paper, two convolutional neural network approaches are proposed. They include a method of reconstructing maritime point target signals, while rejecting non-homogeneous clutter and a novel approach that is able to directly locate the target signal peak from sea clutter using a convolutional autoencoder trained in a supervised manner.

To utilize aforementioned features available in Automatic information system (AIS), we formulate the problem in a novel way, by detecting anomalies in a set of directed graphs representing the movement pattern at each time interval.

"an adaptive hyper parameter tuning model for ship fuel consumption prediction under complex maritime environments","2022","An accurate prediction of ship fuel consumption is critical for speed, trim, and voyage optimisation etc. While previous studies have focused on predicting ship fuel consumption with respect to a variety of factors, research on the impact of environmental factors on fuel consumption has been lacking. In addition, although recent research efforts have widely focused on machine learning methods to predict fuel consumption, studies on hyperparameter values that are suitable for these prediction models are limited. To compensate for this deficiency in existing literature, an adaptive hyperparameter tuning method is proposed, and the effects of maritime environmental factors on fuel consumption are taken into account. Through experimentation, the proposed adaptive hyperparameter tuning method was validated via artificial neural network (ANN), support vector regression (SVR), random forest (RF), and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso). The hyperparameter tuning proportionally increased the amplitudes of the coefficients of determination (R2) of these algorithms. The increase of the amplitude demonstrated the following trend, in the order of the largest increase to the lowest increase: ANN, Lasso, SVM, and RF. The rates of increase were between 0.0773% and 2.1653%. Furthermore, after the environmental factors were considered, the prediction accuracies of the ANN and Lasso increased; however, the opposite was observed for the SVR and RF. As such, we confirmed that the use of Bayesian optimisation for hyperparameter tuning can effectively improve the fuel consumption prediction accuracy, and our proposed model can therefore serve as a significant reference for calculating fuel consumption.","Bayesian optimization,Hyperparameter tuning,Environmental factors,Ship fuel consumption,Artificial neural network,"
"a densenet-based learning framework toward maritime end-to-end autoencoder communication systems","2023","With the prosperous development of the shipping industry, a variety of emerging maritime services are continuously emerging, highlighting the increased importance and necessity for high-reliability maritime communication. Building upon existing research on end-to-end autoencoder communication systems, this paper proposes a densely connected convolutional networks (DenseNet)-based maritime autoencoder communication system (DenseNet-MAE). Specifically, the DenseNet module is employed to take advantage of its cross-layer connectivity and feature reuse for the extraction of deeper features of the transmitted signal. Furthermore, In order to improve the systemâ€™s reliability in low signal noise ratio (SNR) environments, the convolutional code (CC) concept is introduced into the DenseNet-MAE using recurrent neural network (RNN). The DenseNet-MAE utilizes the long short term memory (LSTM) to extract the spatio-temporal correlation of data and solve the 'long-term dependency' problem.

"intrusion detection for maritime transportation systems with batch federated aggregation","2023","As a fast-growing and promising technology, Internet of Things (IoT) significantly promotes the informationization and intelligentization of Maritime Transportation System (MTS). The massive data collected during the voyage is usually disposed of with the assistance of cloud or edge computing, which imposes serious cyber security threats. For multifarious cyber-attacks, Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is one of the efficient mechanisms to prevent IoT devices from network intrusion. However, most of the methods based on deep learning train their models in a centralized manner, which needs uploading all data to the central server for training, increasing the risk of privacy disclosure. In this paper, we consider the characteristics of IoT-based MTS and propose a CNN-MLP based model for intrusion detection which is trained through Federated Learning, named FedBatch. Federated Learning keeps the model training local and only updates the global model through the exchange of model parameters, preserving the privacy of local data on vessels. First, the characteristics of the communication between different vessels are discussed to model the federated learning process during the voyage. Then, the lightweight local model constructed by Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Multi-Layer Perception (MLP) is designed to save on computing and storage overhead. Moreover, to mitigate the straggler problem during the federated learning in MTS, we proposed an adaptive aggregation method, named Batch Federated Aggregation, which suppresses the oscillations of model parameters during federated learning.

"maritime object detection with event-based cameras","2022","Event cameras differ from conventional frame-based cameras in that each individual pixel responds independently and asynchronously to brightness changes. Instead of absolute brightness measurements reported as entire frames at regular time intervals, data from event cameras come as a stream of spatially and temporally sparse brightness change events.

In this work, we apply Asynet, a sparse convolutional neural network based object detection model, to maritime event data sets we collected in the field. To address the limited size of our data set, we propose fine-tuning from pretrained weights learned from the neuromorphic Caltech101 (N-Caltech101) data set and then using a combination of augmentation techniques drawn from traditional image-based computer vision as well as event-specific augmentations.

"rainfall yield characteristics of electrical storm observed in the spanish basque country area during the period 1992–1996","2008","This paper is focused on the study of rainfall yield characteristics of electrical storms observed over the Northern Iberian Peninsula during 1992–1996. To this aim Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) method have been used. The SOM method is a group of artificial neural networks based on the topological properties of the human brain. Results clearly suggest that there exist three different meteorological patterns that are linked to the characteristics of electrical events found in the study area. In winter, most of the electrical events are formed under oceanic advection (NW air fluxes). On these cases, mean rainfall yield estimates reach values of 700 104 m3 per cloud to ground lightning flash (CG flash). During summer most frequent electrical storms are associated to local instability shooting by surface heating with advection of humidity coming from the Iberian Peninsula. Under these meteorological situations, rain is scarcer if compared with oceanic events but lightning CG counts reach the maximum values found in the area (about 10 CG counts per 20×20 km2 and day) giving this way the smallest rainfall yield with a mean value of 15 104 m3 per CG flash. Iberian air fluxes associated with cold air in upper parts of the atmosphere represent the third meteorological pattern found. This pattern is most common in spring and autumn but is not unusual in the rest of the seasons. In those cases mean rainfall yield in the area is about 150 104 m3 per CG flash. In all electrical episodes K instability index is greater than 15 °C but in the most lightning producing events, this index reaches in the area values greater than 24 °C. PCA results pointed out that there exists a relationship between rain and CG counts expressed by the first principal component computed from standardized data. However, we must notice that no event is solely linked to this axis, since a seasonal influence which decreases lightning production when rain increases is always present. Results found are of great interest for short term forecasting of flashfloods in mountainous areas like the Spanish Basque Country region.","Lightning–rain relationship,Applied physics,Northern Iberian Peninsula,Rainfall yield estimates,Fluid mechanics,Oceanic and continental lightning,"

Three ML methods, NL-PCR, NL-PLSR and probabilistic ANN, are calibrated using the data from two sister ships. The calibrated models are used to extract the varying trend in ship’s hydrodynamic performance over time and predict the change in performance through several propeller and hull cleaning events. The predicted change in performance is compared with the corresponding values estimated using the fouling friction coefficient (ΔCF). The ML methods are found to be performing well while modeling the hydrodynamic state of the ships with probabilistic ANN model performing the best, but the results from NL-PCR and NL-PLSR are not far behind, indicating that it may be possible to use simple methods to solve such problems with the help of domain knowledge.","NL-PCR,Probabilistic ANN,Ship performance monitoring,Marine fouling,NL-PLSR,Machine learning,"

Traditionally, the ship recognition mission is completed by remote sensing or synthetic aperture radar (SAR) or manual calibration via maritime surveillance video. However, the difficulty arises in implementing the mission when it suffers the weather with a poor visibility. The recognition accuracy may deteriorate dramatically in such a hostile environment, especially in the heavy fog environment at sea when using conventional methods. In this case, we develop a novel framework for ship recognition based on a smart recognition system that relies on the dark channel defogging and the neural networks. First, a dark-channel defogging algorithm is utilized to remove the adverse impact of poor visibility on recognition. After that, three different neural networks are used to train the defogged images (Specifically: Faster-RCNN, SSD, YOLOv3).

"on the effectiveness of ai-assisted anomaly detection methods in maritime navigation","2020","The automatic identification system (AIS) has become an essential tool for maritime security. Nevertheless, how to effectively use the static and dynamic voyage information of the AIS data in maritime traffic situation awareness is still a challenge. This paper presents a comparative study of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques on their effectiveness in dealing with various anomalies in maritime domain using the AIS data. The AIS on-off switching (OOS) anomaly is critical in maritime security, since AIS technology is susceptible to manipulation and it can be switched on and off to hide illegal activities. Thus, we try to detect and distinguish between intentional and non-intentional AIS OOS anomalies through our AI -assisted anomaly detection framework. We use AIS data, in particular positional and navigational status of vessels, to study the effectiveness of seven AI techniques, such as artificial neural network, support vector machine, logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, decision tree, random forest and naive Bayes, in detecting the AIS OOS anomalies. Our experimental results show that ANN and SVM are the most suitable techniques in detecting the AIS OOS anomalies with 99.9% accuracy.

"design of a decision support system to achieve condition-based maintenance in ship machinery systems","2023","A decision support system is proposed for the condition-based maintenance of ship machinery systems based on the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) approach. A case study is conducted for a container ship's main diesel engine. Within the scope of the methodology, the main engine power is predicted based on exhaust gas outlet temperatures of cylinders and the main engine shaft RPM. In this regard, firstly, two different strategies such as the creation of the cylinder-basis model and the development of the overall system model are developed to determine the ANFIS model structure for the analysis. Then, comparative analyses are carried out to select a suitable ANFIS structure and its specific membership functions. In addition, the estimation process is also performed by the artificial neural network (ANN) model, and its results are compared with the findings of the best ANFIS structure. The success of the constructed models is evaluated by some error metrics. The overall ANFIS model with 5 membership functions is determined as the best approach by scores of 0.9806 for R2, 1.6588 MW for RMSE, and 3.2703 for MAPE. As a result of the estimation procedure, a decision support system to assist marine operators in maintenance operations is developed. The proposed strategy can be applied to different types of systems in the ship engine room such as the fuel oil system and can be improved by including more parameters obtained from the system's significant points in the analysis.","Anomaly detection,Ship machinery system,ANN,Condition-based maintenance,Maintenance,ANFIS,"
"maritime buoyage inspection system based on an unmanned aerial vehicle and active disturbance rejection control","2021","The unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is inexpensive and offers a fast response speed and robust flexibility; thus, it is a promising tool in the maritime buoyage inspection scenario, which involves monitoring and accessing a lateral mark system far away from the coast. However, two main problems can occur during inspection. The first is extreme weather conditions, resulting in a deviation between the inspection route and the design route. The second is that the buoyage beacons are visited only once. Therefore, this article proposes a buoyage inspection system consisting of a single UAV and random coastal buoys. The UAV automatically takes off from the depot, performs a self-check on the buoy beacons, and then returns to the depot. A cascade active disturbance rejection controller (ADRC) is designed to adjust the real-time trajectory of the UAV system. A feasible trajectory planning method is also designed based on the continuous Hopfield neural network (CHNN) and genetic algorithm (GA) to minimize the inspection distance. Extensive simulations are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.","continuous hopfield neural network,buoy inspection,lateral mark system,Inspection,inspection route,Genetic algorithms,design route,maritime buoyage inspection system,neurocontrollers,inspection,coastal buoys,genetic algorithms,CHNN,genetic algorithm,Transfer functions,unmanned aerial vehicle,trajectory planning method,buoyage beacons,active disturbance rejection control,autonomous aerial vehicles,active disturbance rejection controller,continuous Hopfield neural network,Unmanned aerial vehicles,Trajectory,maritime buoyage inspection scenario,UAV system,Hopfield neural nets,Trajectory tracking,Unmanned aerial vehicle,collision avoidance,marine control,buoy beacons,ADRC,Heuristic algorithms,"

"machine learning for shaft power prediction and analysis of fouling related performance deterioration","2021","Improving operational performance and reducing fuel consumption is increasingly important for shipping companies. Ship performance degrades over time due to hull and propeller fouling; therefore assessing when fouling effects are significant enough to warrant cleaning is critical. Advancements in onboard data logging systems, combined with machine learning techniques, unlock the potential to predict fouling effects accurately and determine when to clean. This study evaluates five models for shaft power prediction: Multiple Linear Regression, Decision Tree (AdaBoost), K – Nearest Neighbours, Artificial Neural Network and Random Forest. The importance of pre-processing is highlighted, contributing to the creation of a model with lower errors than previous studies. The significance of environmental parameters was explored, with the novel integration of wave statistics to the operational dataset, and simulated power-speed curves created from predictions to identify performance deterioration due to fouling. The Random Forest model was most effective in predicting shaft power, with an error of 1.17%. The addition of ‘Days Since Clean’ and ‘Significant Wave Height’ increased prediction accuracy by 0.07% and 0.12% respectively.

This paper deals with the challenge of estimating Fuel Oil Consumption (FOC) in the context of Weather Routing (WR). Given a plethora of features collected from the vesselâ€™s Automatic Identification System (AIS) or on-board sensor installations, we examine how a predictive FOC scheme can be coupled with WR optimization algorithms in order to reduce the vesselâ€™s FOC, emissions, and the overall cost of a voyage. In order to handle the amount of data required for FOC prediction, we employ a streaming pipeline that harvests data in real-time from different sources and processes them appropriately for visualization, causal analysis, and forecasting purposes. In this direction, we first conduct an exploratory analysis to examine and unveil the importance and inter-association between the various variables related to sea-keeping and weather features, in order to utilize them effectively in the context of a FOC predictive scheme. Furthermore, we introduce a novel recurrent neural network architecture that approximates ideally the underlying function describing the features and the vesselâ€™s FOC by taking into account historical data, and we showcase the results.

"seaâ€“land segmentation in maritime surveillance radars via k-nearest neighbor classifier","2020","Shipborne or airborne maritime surveillance radars at scan mode work at a complex scene consisting of land, sea, and islands. Sea-land segmentation provides a two-class classification of sea clutter versus ground clutter to the surveillance scene as a precondition of adaptive target detection. It is a difficult problem because only a few coherent pulses are available at scan mode. Moreover, due to moving radar platforms and wide dynamic range of ground and sea clutter in power, average amplitude, Doppler offset, and initial phase of radar, the returns vector fails to distinguish sea clutter and ground clutter. In this article, a similarity measure of two radar returns vectors, which is invariant to amplitude, Doppler offset, and initial phase, is constructed, which is closely relevant to the Doppler bandwidth of a returns vector. Based on the similarity measure, a K-nearest neighbor classifier is proposed to yield a pixel-level sea-land segmentation of the scene. Further, the morphological filtering is operated on the pixel-level segmentation to obtain a region-level segmentation. Moreover, the discrete FrÃ©chet distances of the main boundaries in successive scan periods are used to assess segmentation quality. The proposed method is verified by measured data from an airborne radar and an island-based radar.

"an unsupervised learning method with convolutional auto-encoder for vessel trajectory similarity computation","2021","To achieve reliable mining results for massive vessel trajectories, one of the most important challenges is how to efficiently compute the similarities between different vessel trajectories. The computation of vessel trajectory similarity has recently attracted increasing attention in the maritime data mining research community. However, traditional shape- and warping-based methods often suffer from several drawbacks such as high computational cost and sensitivity to unwanted artifacts and non-uniform sampling rates, etc. To eliminate these drawbacks, we propose an unsupervised learning method which automatically extracts low-dimensional features through a convolutional auto-encoder (CAE). In particular, we first generate the informative trajectory images by remapping the raw vessel trajectories into two-dimensional matrices while maintaining the spatio-temporal properties. Based on the massive vessel trajectories collected, the CAE can learn the low-dimensional representations of informative trajectory images in an unsupervised manner. The trajectory similarity is finally equivalent to efficiently computing the similarities between the learned low-dimensional features, which strongly correlate with the raw vessel trajectories. Comprehensive experiments on realistic data sets have demonstrated that the proposed method largely outperforms traditional trajectory similarity computation methods in terms of efficiency and effectiveness. The high-quality trajectory clustering performance could also be guaranteed according to the CAE-based trajectory similarity computation results.","Convolutional neural network (CNN),Convolutional auto-encoder (CAE),Automatic identification system (AIS),Trajectory clustering,Trajectory similarity,"

"real-time infrared horizon detection in maritime and land environments based on hyper-laplace filter and convolutional neural network","2023","The infrared (IR) horizon is an essential reference for near-ground state awareness and target detection. The traditional horizon detection algorithms based on hand-crafted features claim the advantage of being intuitive and highly targeted, however, their capability of detail extraction and robustness is not strong enough when switching among diverse scenes, meanwhile, the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have the powerful ability in feature acquisition, but has the disadvantages of interpretability and instability. Given this, this article proposes a novel horizon detection algorithm that combines the traditional method and CNN. First, the hyper-Laplace filter (HLF) is proposed to eliminate the interferences and enhance the saliency of the target. Then a positioning module (PM) based on the traditional idea which fully utilizes the structural characteristics of multifeature-maps in CNN is present to extract the endpoints of the horizon. Finally, an auxiliary module that consists of a revise branch (RB) and self-attention module (SAM) is designed to assist the PM with detailed corrections. Compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms, experiments based on three datasets with more than 25000 frames under various scenes demonstrate that the proposed algorithm not only achieves the best accuracy and highest stability but also addresses real-time needs.

"a deep semantic autoencoder for maritime wireless communications","2023","With the rapid development of maritime transportation, ocean tourism, monitoring, surveillance and aquaculture, the maritime communication industry has encountered new opportunities. Maritime End-to-end (E2E) communication systems based on deep learning (DL) have become diverse, while semantic communication systems have become a critical research point due to their ability to understand and analyze natural language. In this paper, we propose a deep semantic autoencoder (DSA) for maritime wireless communications. The DSA consists of a semantic encoder, channel encoder, channel decoder, and semantic decoder. The DSA employs transformers and convolutional neural networks to extract and restore the meaning of sentences while minimizing semantic errors during transmission. In order to enhance the effectiveness of the DSA in transmitting maritime data, the Rician fading channel is utilized to simulate complex and varied marine environments. Furthermore, the system parameters of the DSA are optimized through training the maritime data and calculating the loss functions. Extensive simulation experiments indicate that compared to the benchmark, the DSA demonstrates superior bilingual evaluation understudy and sentence similarity performance under different signal-to-noise ratio conditions, indicating its ability to effectively extract semantics.","end-to-end,semantic communication systems,Semantics,surveillance,maritime data,Transportation,Benchmark testing,deep learning (artificial intelligence),system parameters,maritime wireless communications,semantic encoder,maritime communication industry,deep semantic autoencoder,natural language processing,semantic errors,Wireless communication,critical research point,deep learning,marine safety,semantics,marine engineering,Maritime wireless communications,Rician channels,maritime transportation,maritime end-to-end communication systems,convolutional neural nets,semantic decoder,Training,ocean tourism,marine communication,Simulation,Surveillance,artificial intelligence,DSA,channel decoder,aquaculture,Rician fading channel,"

"fault detection with lstm-based variational autoencoder for maritime components","2021","Maintenance routines on ships today follow either a reactive maintenance (RM) or preventive maintenance (PvM) approach. RM can be regarded as post-failure repair, which might create large costs. PvM uses predetermined maintenance intervals, which often involves unnecessary maintenance. Recently, prognostics and health management (PHM) has emerged as a potential way to develop an ideal maintenance policy. PHM aims to provide optimal maintenance schedule through the use of sensor measurement for fault detection and fault prognostics, among which fault detection is the first and fundamental action. In this paper, a long-short term memory based variational autoencoder (LSTM-VAE) is proposed for fault detection of maritime components onboard. It is a semi-supervised approach that requires only fault-free data for training. Therefore, it is widely applicable in the maritime industry since operational data in normal conditions already exists. Real-world operation data collected from a diesel engine on the research vessel (RV) Gunnerus is used to validate the method.

The UAVâ€™s onboard sensors provide input for the neural network regarding each vessel in the search area, resulting in a prioritization of vessels to be visited.

"detection of invalid ais messages using machine learning techniques","2022","Coastal nations monitor maritime activities in the interest of defence, security, and safety. This form of monitoring typically occurs at operations centers that visualize the maritime environment by creating a Recognized Maritime Picture (RMP) covering a particular area of interest. The creation of this picture changed drastically with the introduction of the Automatic Identification System (AIS). AIS messages are known to contain numerous types of errors and in April 2020 a unique error was found in the data stream. This error consisted of messages indicating the appearance of over 200 vessels in the North Atlantic taking part in a yacht race when in fact no race or physical ships existed. The following work explores the application of various machine learning (ML) techniques to help identify these types of fabricated AIS messages. Specific ML techniques were explored including: K-means clustering, Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Feed-Forward Neural Networks (FNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and One-Class Support Vector Machines (One-SVM). The results showed that DT, RF, and FNN best identified the fabricated AIS messages with F1 scores greater than 93 percent on the test data.","maritime domain awareness,AIS,automatic identification system,machine learning,"
"adaptive detection tracking system for autonomous uav maritime patrolling","2020","Nowadays, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are considered reliable systems, suitable for several autonomous applications, especially for target detection and tracking. Although significant developments were achieved in object detection systems over the last decades using the deep learning technique known as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), there are still research gaps in this area. In this paper, we present a new object detection-tracking algorithm that can be used on low power consuming processing boards. In particular, we analysed a specific application scenario in which a UAV patrols coastlines and autonomously classifies different kind of marine objects. Current state of the art solutions propose centralised architectures or flying systems with human in the loop, making the whole system poorly efficient and not scalable. On the contrary, applying a Deep Learning detection system that runs on commercial Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) makes UAVs potentially more efficient than humans (especially for dull tasks like coastline patrolling) and the whole system becomes easily scalable because each UAV can fly independently and the Ground Control Station does not represent a bottleneck. To deal with this task, a database consisting of more than 115000 images was created to train and test several CNN architectures. Furthermore, an adaptive detection-tracking algorithm was introduced to make the whole system faster by optimizing the balancing between detecting new objects and tracking existing targets. The proposed solution is based on the measure of the tracking confidence and the frame similarity, by means of the Structural SIMilarity (SSIM) index, computed both globally and locally.

"location estimation in a maritime environment using a monocular camera","2014","Maritime surveillance is a very important task in coastal areas, especially in harbour environments. The most popular such systems include components like Automatic Identification System (AIS) and Radar. Camera based visual surveillance can be used as an alternative to these systems in order to overcome the lacking features of them. Sea surface object detection and identification is a major need for such visual surveillance systems. Most of the current visual surveillance systems don't have the ability of identifying vessels in real time. A vessel can be identified using information from other systems, if the location of the vessel is identified. Location estimation of sea surface objects is mainly explored in this research. Video stream from a single geo stationary camera is used as the input; however camera properties are not used for any calculation. Mainly two distance measurements are considered and different approaches for estimating the distances are explored. Neural network approach gave considerably accurate results in vertical distance estimation and it was found that the shortest distance from camera to the object can be measured best using B-spline 3D curve fitting. Data taken from AIS is used for fitting curves and training neural network. After calculating distances, latitudes and longitudes are calculated. An evaluation has been done comparing the calculated values and the values obtained from AIS data using various statistical tests.

"demand and supply-side determinants of electric power consumption and representative roadmaps to 100% renewable systems","2021","The need to transform electric power systems to a cleaner electricity mix to help save the climate is undisputable but existing transition pathways have become unreliable due to inadequate representation of both demand and supply-side determinants of electric power supply, as well as failure to inculcate volatility in electric power systems in the core transition modelling. This study inculcates demand and supply-side determinants to investigate the long- and short-run causal relationships between the electric power system, macroeconomic performance, demography, environmental quality, and capital formation, for Sweden. We also propose and implement econometric and two-stage attention-based machine learning models for volatility-consistent electric power forecasting. Using annual data spanning 1990–2018, the results suggest a long-run relationship exists between electricity generation and the independent variables. Empirical results for the volatility-consistent attention-based machine learning model predict that Sweden’s electric power demand in 2050 could reach ∼112 TWh if conservation practices are implemented, and ∼146 TWh if otherwise. If conservation practices are implemented, evidence from selected volatility-consistent simulations show that Sweden can provide 100% of all her electricity demand from cleaner sources by 2030. The findings depict that Sweden must implement stringent and radical policies to achieve its mid-century green electricity targets.","Demand and supply-side determinants,100% renewable Electricity consumption,Two-stage attention-based recurrent neural network,Volatility-consistent cleaner electricity transition pathways,Causality,Climate change,"
"networking the global maritime partnership","2013","Eight years ago, the then-U.S. Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Michael Mullen, unveiled the concept of the 'Thousand-Ship Navy' as a new taxonomy for international naval cooperation. Embraced by the George W. Bush administration and renamed 'The Global Maritime Partnership (GMP) Initiative' this concept was rapidly embraced by the community of nations as a way to secure the global commons. In the ensuing years this concept has become a new international norm and the sine qua non for international naval cooperation. But as international navies have gained experience operating together across a wide spectrum of operations from conflict to humanitarian efforts, they have also found that the networking challenges have been daunting and these C4ISR challenges have impeded effective maritime partnering. This paper will address the way C4ISR challenges manifest today as navies unite in a GMP. It will also describe how lessons learned from past networking and coalition efforts can inform global security efforts today.

"a semi-supervised deep learning model for ship encounter situation classification","2021","Maritime safety is an important issue for global shipping industries. Currently, most of collision accidents at sea are caused by the misjudgement of the ship’s operators. The deployment of maritime autonomous surface ships (MASS) can greatly reduce ships’ reliance on human operators by using an automated intelligent collision avoidance system to replace human decision-making. To successfully develop such a system, the capability of autonomously identifying other ships and evaluating their associated encountering situation is of paramount importance. In this paper, we aim to identify ships’ encounter situation modes using deep learning methods based upon the Automatic Identification System (AIS) data. First, a segmentation process is developed to divide each ship’s AIS data into different segments that contain only one encounter situation mode. This is different to the majority of studies that have proposed encounter situation mode classification using hand-crafted features, which may not reflect the actual ship’s movement states. Furthermore, a number of present classification tasks are conducted using substantial labelled AIS data followed by a supervised training paradigm, which is not applicable to our dataset as it contains a large number of unlabelled AIS data. Therefore, a method called Semi-Supervised Convolutional Encoder–Decoder Network (SCEDN) for ship encounter situation classification based on AIS data is proposed. The structure of the network is not only able to automatically extract features from AIS segments but also share training parameters for the unlabelled data. The SCEDN uses an encoder–decoder convolutional structure with four channels for each segment (distance, speed, Time to the Closed Point of Approach (TCPA) and Distance to the Closed Point of Approach (DCPA)) been developed. The performance of the SCEDN model are evaluated by comparing to several baselines with the experimental results demonstrating a higher accuracy can be achieved by our proposed model.","Automatic Identification System (AIS),Trajectory data,Deep learning,Convolutional neural network,Semi-supervised learning,Encounter situation classification,Encoder–decoder,"
"a multi-task learning-based framework for global maritime trajectory and destination prediction with ais data","2022","Automatic Identification System (AIS) was initially developed for tracking ships and avoiding collisions. As numerous small satellites were launched in recent years, millions of AIS messages are captured by these satellite AIS providers every day. The massive amount of data allow shipping firms and port operators to better predict vessels’ movement. In this study, a computational framework is developed to predict future trajectories and destinations of vessels by applying deep learning to the satellite AIS messages containing self-reporting positioning data. We employed deep learning approaches for large-scale maritime prediction and identifies the most suitable deep neural networks for this specific application. Three prediction models, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Dense Neural Networks (DNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) have been tested in the framework. A multi-task learning architecture is implemented based on test results. Through sharing parameters while training, this architecture enables long-term destination predictions by balancing short-term trajectory predictions. The framework is validated globally with the experiments covering five large-scale sea areas. The experimental results demonstrate that the LSTM model with an average accuracy percentage of 85.1% outperforms the CNN and DNN with accuracy percentages of 68.3% and 78.2% respectively. The LSTM model with multi-task architecture can achieve an accuracy of 87.0%.

The above problems restrict the development of maritime- related work such as intelligent supervision, collision warning, accident investigation, etc. To improve the imaging quality of maritime video images, we propose an efficient and effective multi-deep neural network (termed EEMNN) for low-visibility enhancement. In particular, we fuse the multi-scale information extracted from the encoder-decoder module using the dense blocks (DBs) and attention blocks (ABs). It is capable of enhancing the fused information leading to preserving the edges, textures, and other fine details.

"autonomous mooring towards autonomous maritime navigation and offshore operations","2020","Bollard is a vital component of mooring system. It is the anchor point for mooring ropes to be fixed in order to secure the vessel or ship. An algorithm that translates the segmented mask of bollard output from masked R-CNN along with bounding box and associated class probability to its corresponding edge coordinate and finally to the single reference point for efficient detection and classification of bollard towards autonomous mooring is presented. At first stage, Mask R-CNN framework is trained with custom built bollard. The model obtained from the training is inferred with real data resulting in instance segment of bollard. The segmented mask obtained contains relatively large amount of the data points representing the whole area of bollard, which typically is not desirable. In order to precisely localize the bollard with one reference co-ordinate, the proposed algorithm is applied to segmented mask. Firstly, it translates the segmented mask to only four co-ordinate points, where each point correspond to the edge of bollard. Further, from the edges, the reference point is estimated. This causes significant reduction in point of interest (POI) and has potential to reduce the error encountered during pose estimation of the bollard in 3D thus making the autonomous mooring more precise and accurate.","Image edge detection,object detection and classification,remotely operated vehicles,autonomous mooring,masked R-CNN,robot vision,Marine vehicles,bounding box,reference point,data points,Industrial electronics,bollard output,pose estimation,Instance segmentation,marine systems,ships,POI,Three-dimensional displays,mooring ropes,object detection,Pose estimation,point of interest,class probability,anchor point,co-ordinate points,offshore operations,Training,segmented mask,probability,autonomous maritime navigation,Navigation,image segmentation,Mask R-CNN,"
"a cnn-lstm network for augmenting target detection in real maritime wide area surveillance radar data","2020","Typical radar detectors exploit only a small proportion of the valuable information contained in radar reflections, i.e. magnitude and Doppler. A neural network-based approach for augmenting traditional radar detector structures using machine learning (ML) is proposed in this paper. Specifically, the network is designed to augment target detection in the field of maritime wide area surveillance for non-coherent data. A combination network consisting of a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract spatial features and a long short-term memory (LSTM) for extracting temporal patterns in the spatial features is proposed. The network augments the detector structure by blanking out regions of the frame which are classified as not containing a target, thus reducing false alarms. The network is tested on data containing four marine targets collected by a ground-based radar. The data set was chosen because it contains strong sea clutter returns. When ML is used, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves are shifted to lower probability of false alarm (PFA). A Kalman filter tracker was applied to the ML-augmented and baseline detections, and it was shown that ML-augmented detections produced similar tracks at lower PFA. The feature discovering capability of the network is analyzed through a series of tests, and the argument is made that the CNN-LSTM network presented in this work demonstrates the ability to improve the detection performance by exploiting spatial and temporal information in the data.","real maritime wide area surveillance radar data,detector structure,Kalman filters,marine radar,baseline detections,radar detection,radar clutter,CNN-LSTM network,Feature extraction,ML-augmented detections,LSTM,target detection augmentation,neural nets,target tracking,short-term memory,wide area surveillance radar,Artificial neural networks,CNN,noncoherent data,maritime surveillance,object detection,feature extraction,combination network,search radar,data set,radar imaging,convolutional neural network,detection performance,ground-based radar,neural network-based approach,radar detectors,radar tracking,radar reflections,temporal information,marine targets,probability,Clutter,Object detection,false alarm,traditional radar detector structures,learning (artificial intelligence),spatial features,Detectors,Radar detection,spatial information,"
"correcting predictions from oceanic maritime numerical models via residual learning","2018","Accurately predicting significant wave height is essential for reducing the damages caused by storm surge.

However, marine communication in deep-sea waters is expanding as maritime traffic grows. To serve mission-critical applications, a growing number of maritime end-users require high throughput and low latency. Although deep-sea satellite connections will enable 6G networks, however due to limited service capacity owing to the long propagation delay between end-user and satellites. We propose unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as aerial backhauling and a relay medium in the marine communication network assisted by satellites and coastal base stations (BSs). The power allocation strategy of multi-satellites for a 6G network is investigated in this work. The power allocation problem is non-convex, hence deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is used to solve it instead of the conventional optimization technique. Our research aims to optimize the networkâ€™s total capacity in the case when the satellites are randomly and densely dispersed.

"eprd: exploiting prior knowledge for evidence-providing automatic rumor detection","2023","With the prevalence of social media platforms, rumors have been a serious social problem. Notably, existing rumor detection methods simply provide detection labels while ignoring their explanation. However, illustrating the reasons why a suspicious statement is a rumor is essential. To address this realistic scenario, we propose a novel Evidence-Providing Rumor Detection model called EPRD. EPRD incorporates a wide variety of information from both prior knowledge sources and current comments. It also learns bilaterally friendly representations for interpretable rumor detection. EPRD first retrieves evidence from prior knowledge sources and checks the relationship between the given statement and its evidence. Our model then constructs two heterogeneous graph objects to simulate the propagation layout of the current comments and evidence relationships. Finally, EPRD integrates the GraphSAGE component and attention mechanism to detect rumors. To the best of our knowledge, we propose the first model that incorporates prior knowledge to verify rumors and boost credibility. Experiments on two real-world Twitter datasets demonstrate that EPRD consistently exhibits the best rumor detection performance.

"an adaptive threshold fast dbscan algorithm with preserved trajectory feature points for vessel trajectory clustering","2023","Vessel navigation pattern recognition plays an important role in the research of intelligent transportation on water. Clustering using the data stored in The Automatic Identification System (AIS) is a current research hotspot. However, there are three problems in the past clustering analysis. First, the traditional Douglas-Peucker (DP) Compression Algorithm exists feature point loss and trajectory distortion when compressing trajectories. Second, Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm require high time cost. Finally, most of the studies ignore the interaction between parameters when choosing the parameters of DBSCAN. These problems seriously affect the efficiency and accuracy of clustering. To solve these problems, this paper improves the existing methods by (1) Adaptive selection of compression thresholds and trajectory feature points for each trajectory when using the DP algorithm ensures the realism of the compressed trajectory; (2) using the Fast-DTW algorithm to improve the computation speed and ensure the accuracy of trajectory similarity; (3) Self-selection of parameter combinations based on Silhouette Coefficient (SC) scores was achieved using the similarity distribution of the trajectories in combination with an improved K-Adaptive Nearest Neighbors (KANN). The experiments show that the proposed method can greatly reduce the time cost of clustering compared to the original method and significantly outperforms the three compared algorithms in terms of clustering effect images.","Fast-DTW,Ship trajectory clustering,AF-DP,DBSCAN,Navigation pattern recognition,"

Early life stages of sea urchin, Paracentrotus lividus, were selected for toxicity testing of oil low-energy water accommodated fractions. A multi-index approach, including larval size increase and malformation, and developmental disruption as endpoints, was sensitive to discriminate from slight to severe toxicity caused by the tested aqueous fractions. IFO (heavy bunker oil) was more toxic than NNA (light crude oil), with MGO (light bunker oil) in between. The dispersant was toxic and further on it enhanced oil toxicity. Toxic units revealed that identified PAHs were not the main cause for toxicity, most likely exerted by individual or combined toxic action of non-measured compounds.","Oil,Dispersant,Sea urchin embryo,Toxicity,Iced seas,Mixtures,"

Integrating Inertial Navigation Systems (INS) with shipborne Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) provides a viable solution. However, the system's reliability heavily relies on GNSS availability. This paper proposes a method to enhance the reliability of shipborne INS/GNSS integrated navigation systems during GNSS abnormal sampling periods. The proposed method consists of two parts. Firstly, using specially designed input and output parameters, a pseudo-GNSS prediction model based on a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network (Bi-LSTM) is constructed to generate predicted pseudo-GNSS measurements during periods of GNSS loss, effectively filling in the gaps left by the absence of actual GNSS data. Secondly, Huber's M-estimation-based Robust Cubature Kalman filter (RCKF) is integrated into the data fusion algorithm, and a switching mechanism between RCKF and the Cubature Kalman filter (CKF) is established based on the source of GNSS data utilized for measurement update, to mitigate the impact of non-Gaussian distribution prediction noise introduced by pseudo-GNSS prediction model. Experimental validation using real ship navigation data in a natural marine environment confirms the proposed method's capability to maintain navigation accuracy during GNSS loss for shipborne INS/GNSS integrated navigation systems. The algorithm's superiority becomes more evident as the duration of GNSS loss increases, underscoring its effectiveness in enhancing shipborne integrated navigation system reliability.","Bi-LSTM,Intelligent ship,GNSS loss,Robust CKF,Navigation reliability,Ship integrated navigation,"

"asynchronous trajectory matching-based multimodal maritime data fusion for vessel traffic surveillance in inland waterways","2023","The automatic identification system (AIS) and video cameras have been widely exploited for vessel traffic surveillance in inland waterways. The AIS data could provide vessel identity and dynamic information on vessel position and movements. In contrast, the video data could describe the visual appearances of moving vessels without knowing the information on identity, position, movements, etc. To further improve vessel traffic surveillance, it becomes necessary to fuse the AIS and video data to simultaneously capture the visual features, identity, and dynamic information for the vessels of interest. However, the performance of AIS and video data fusion is susceptible to issues such as data spatial difference, message asynchronous transmission, visual object occlusion, etc. In this work, we propose a deep learning-based simple online and real-time vessel data fusion method (termed DeepSORVF). We first extract the AIS-and video-based vessel trajectories, and then propose an asynchronous trajectory matching method to fuse the AIS-based vessel information with the corresponding visual targets. In addition, by combining the AIS-and video-based movement features, we also present a prior knowledge-driven anti-occlusion method to yield accurate and robust vessel tracking results under occlusion conditions. To validate the efficacy of our DeepSORVF, we have also constructed a new benchmark dataset (termed FVessel) for vessel detection, tracking, and data fusion. It consists of many videos and the corresponding AIS data collected in various weather conditions and locations. The experimental results have demonstrated that our method is capable of guaranteeing high-reliable data fusion and anti-occlusion vessel tracking. The DeepSORVF code and FVessel dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/gy65896/DeepSORVF and https://github.com/gy65896/FVessel, respectively.","Trajectory,deep neural network,anti-occlusion tracking,Visualization,Radar tracking,Object detection,vessel traffic surveillance,Artificial intelligence,Inland waterways,Surveillance,Data integration,data fusion,"
"predictive control of container flows in maritime intermodal terminals","2013","Predictive control is investigated as a paradigm for the allocation of handling resources to transfer containers inside intermodal terminals. The decisions on the allocation of such resources are derived from the minimization of performance cost functions that measure the lay times of carriers over a forward horizon basing on a model of the container flows. Such a model allows one to take advantage of the information available in real time on the arrival or departure of carriers with the corresponding amounts of containers scheduled for loading or unloading. The resulting strategy of resource allocation can be regarded as a feedback control law and is obtained by solving nonlinear programming problems online. Since the computation may be too expensive, a technique based on the idea of approximating offline such a law is proposed. The approximation is performed by using neural networks, which allow one to construct an approximate feedback controller and generate the corresponding online control actions with a negligible computational burden. The effectiveness of the approach is shown via simulations in a case study.","feedback,container flows,resource allocation handling,Mathematical model,neural networks,Resource management,transfer containers,online control actions,neurocontrollers,Least squares approximation,forward horizon,Loading,predictive control,feedback control law,Containers,containers,nonlinear programming,freight handling,Container terminal management,maritime intermodal terminals,feedback controller,Predictive control,resource allocation,performance cost functions,"

"ais data-driven ship trajectory prediction modelling and analysis based on machine learning and deep learning methods","2023","Maritime transport faces new safety challenges in an increasingly complex traffic environment caused by large-scale and high-speed ships, particularly with the introduction of intelligent and autonomous ships. It is evident that Automatic Identification System (AIS) data-driven ship trajectory prediction can effectively aid in identifying abnormal ship behaviours and reducing maritime risks such as collision, stranding, and contact. Furthermore, trajectory prediction is widely recognised as one of the critical technologies for realising safe autonomous navigation. The prediction methods and their performance are the key factors for future safe and automatic shipping. Currently, ship trajectory prediction lacks the real performance measurement and analysis of different algorithms, including classical machine learning and emerging deep learning methods. This paper aims to systematically analyse the performance of ship trajectory prediction methods and pioneer experimental tests to reveal their advantages and disadvantages as well as fitness in different scenarios involving complicated systems. To do so, five machine learning methods (i.e., Kalman Filter (KF), Support Vector Progression (SVR), Back Propagation network (BP), Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), and Random Forest (RF)) and seven deep learning methods (i.e., Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gate Recurrent Unit (GRU), Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM), Sequence to Sequence (Seq2seq), Bi-directional Gate Recurrent Unit (Bi-GRU), and Transformer) are first extracted from the state-of-the-art literature review and then employed to implement the trajectory prediction and compare their prediction performance in the real world. Three AIS datasets are collected from the waters of representative traffic features, including a normal channel (i.e., the Chengshan Jiao Promontory), complex traffic (i.e., the Zhoushan Archipelago), and a port area (i.e., Caofeidian port). They are selected to test and analyse the performance of all twelve methods based on six evaluation indexes and explore the characteristics and effectiveness of the twelve trajectory prediction methods in detail. The experimental results provide a novel perspective, comparison, and benchmark for ship trajectory prediction research, which not only demonstrates the fitness of each method in different maritime traffic scenarios, but also makes significant contributions to maritime safety and autonomous shipping development.","Deep learning,Maritime safety,Trajectory prediction,AIS data,Machine learning,"

The constantly refined models, resulting from concurrent incremental learning, are used to evaluate the behavior patterns of vessels based on their present motion states. Improvement to the associative learning law for learning temporal associations between vessel events enables conditional probabilities between events to be learned incrementally and locally. This allows weights in the learned model to be interpreted more readily, enabling better location prediction performance. Improvement in prediction performance is achieved by using multiple spatial scales to represent position, enabling the most relevant spatial scale to be used for local vessel behavior. Features and performance of these updates to the learning system using recorded data are described.","learning temporal associations,probabilistic associative learning,maritime,neural networks,Neural networks,Situation awareness,Predictive models,Learning systems,multiple spatial scales,data recording,real-time tracking information,marine engineering,Performance analysis,Training data,learning,Real time systems,Information technology,Tracking,conditional probabilities,maritime situation awareness,concurrent incremental learning,learning (artificial intelligence),Event detection,Terrorism,prediction,vessel motion patterns,"
"data-driven trajectory quality improvement for promoting intelligent vessel traffic services in 6g-enabled maritime iot systems","2021","Future generation communication systems, such as 5G and 6G wireless systems, exploit the combined satellite-terrestrial communication infrastructures to extend network coverage and data throughput for data-driven applications. These ground-breaking techniques have promoted the rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT) in maritime industries. In maritime IoT applications, intelligent vessel traffic services can be guaranteed by collecting and analyzing high volume of spatial data flows from automatic identification system (AIS). This AIS system includes a highly integrated automatic equipment, including functionalities of core communication, tracking, and sensing. The increased utilization of shipboard AIS devices allows the collection of massive trajectory data. However, the received raw AIS data often suffers from undesirable outliers (i.e., poorly tracked timestamped points for vessel trajectories) during signal acquisition and analog-to-digital conversion. The degraded AIS data will bring negative effects on vessel traffic services (e.g., maritime traffic monitoring, intelligent maritime navigation, vessel collision avoidance, etc.) in maritime IoT scenarios. To improve the quality of vessel trajectory records from AIS networks, we propose to develop a two-phase data-driven machine learning framework for vessel trajectory reconstruction. In particular, a density-based clustering method is introduced in the first phase to automatically recognize the undesirable outliers. The second phase proposes a bidirectional long short-term memory (BLSTM)-based supervised learning technique to restore the timestamped points degraded by random outliers in vessel trajectories. Comprehensive experiments on simulated and realistic data sets have verified the dominance of our two-phase vessel reconstruction framework compared to other competing methods. It thus has the capacity of promoting intelligent vessel traffic services in 6G-enabled maritime IoT systems.","short-term memory-based supervised learning technique,maritime traffic monitoring,recurrent neural nets,supervised learning technique,intelligent maritime navigation,data-driven applications,AIS networks,Internet of Things,Monitoring,neural networks,6G-enabled maritime IoT systems,vessel collision avoidance,time stamped point restoration,shipboard AIS devices,BLSTM,two-phase vessel reconstruction framework,spatial data,5G mobile communication,automatic identification system,maritime IoT applications,supervised learning,vessel traffic services,signal reconstruction,intelligent vessel traffic services,6G mobile communication,pattern clustering,vessel trajectories,Artificial intelligence,analogue-digital conversion,two-phase data-driven machine,raw AIS data system,telecommunication traffic,maritime Internet of Things (IoT),6G wireless systems,integrated automatic equipment,Trajectory,signal detection,vessel trajectory reconstruction,marine communication,automatic identification system (AIS),Navigation,maritime industries,bidirectional long short-term memory,combined satellite-terrestrial communication,data-driven trajectory quality improvement,massive trajectory data,future generation communication systems,"

Although some efforts have been made to distinguish the faults and malfunctions (fault detection) that can occur in marine systems, the implementation of fault identification to provide a description of any considered fault type and its nature is still an unexplored area due to the lack of fault data. To overcome this, a methodology for the identification of anomalies in marine systems is presented in this paper. The proposed approach aims to analyse the implementation of time series imaging through the application of the first-order Markov chain in tandem with an analysis of both ResNet50V2 and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) as part of the image classification task.

"ocean oil spill detection from sar images based on multi-channel deep learning semantic segmentation","2023","One of the major threats to marine ecosystems is pollution, particularly, that associated with the offshore oil and gas industry. Oil spills occur in the world's oceans every day, either as large-scale spews from drilling-rig or tanker accidents, or as smaller discharges from all sorts of sea-going vessels. In order to contribute to the timely detection and monitoring of oil spills over the oceans, we propose a new Multi-channel Deep Neural Network (M-DNN) segmentation model and a new and effective Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) image dataset, that enable us to emit forewarnings in a prompt and reliable manner. Our proposed M-DNN is a pixel-level segmentation model intended to improve previous DNN oil-spill detection models, by taking into account multiple input channels, complex oil shapes at different scales (dimensions) and evolution in time, and look-alikes from low wind speed conditions. Our methodology consists of the following components: 1) New Multi-channel SAR Image Database Development; 2) Multi-Channel DNN Model based on U-net and ResNet; and 3) Multi-channel DNN Training and Transfer Learning. Due to the lack of public oil spill databases guaranteeing a correct learning process of the M-DNN, we developed our own database consisting of 16 ENVISAT-ASAR images acquired over the Gulf of Mexico during the Deepwater Horizon (DWH) blowout, off the west coast of South Korea during the Hebei Spirit oil tanker collision, and over the Black Sea.

"anomaly based sea-surface small target detection using k-nearest neighbor classification","2020","Sea-surface small target detection is always a difficult problem in high-resolution maritime ubiquitous radars for complex characteristics of sea clutter, weak target returns, and diversity of targets. Multiple features extracted from radar returns in different domains have ability but not enough to solely distinguish radar returns with target from sea clutter. Joint exploitation of multiple features becomes the key to improve detection performance. In this article, the K-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm and anomaly detection idea are cooperated to develop a novel sea-surface target detection method in the feature space spanned by the eight existing salient features. The detection is realized by the anomaly detection followed by a specially designed KNN-based classifier with a controllable false alarm rate. In the anomaly detection, a decision region is determined by the hyper-spherical coverage of the training set of sea clutter that is sufficient and ergodic in the feature space. The KNN-based classifier is designed based on the training sample set of sea clutter and the training sample set of simulated target returns plus sea clutter that is sufficient but nonergodic, by joint usage of feature weighting, neighbor weighting, and distance weighting. The novel method is validated by the two open and recognized IPIX and CSIR radar databases for sea-surface small target detection.

The dynamic growth of maritime time series has the predominantly complex, and nonlinear and non-stationary properties. To guarantee high-quality prediction performance, we propose to first adopt the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and ensemble EMD (EEMD) methods to decompose the original time series into high- and low-frequency components. The low-frequency components can be easily predicted directly through traditional neural network (NN) methods. It is more difficult to predict high-frequency components due to their properties of weak mathematical regularity. To take advantage of the inherent self-similarities within high-frequency components, these components will be divided into several continuous small (overlapping) segments. The grouped segments with high similarities are then selected to form more proper training datasets for traditional NN methods. This regrouping strategy can assist in enhancing the prediction accuracy of high-frequency components. The final prediction result is obtained by integrating the predicted high- and low-frequency components.

"a contextual hybrid model for vessel movement prediction","2021","Predicting the movement of the vessels can significantly improve the management of safety. While the movement can be a function of geographic contexts, the current systems and methods rarely incorporate contextual information into the analysis. This paper initially proposes a novel context-aware trajectoriesâ€™ simplification method to embed the effects of geographic context which guarantees the logical consistency of the compressed trajectories, and further suggests a hybrid method that is built upon a curvilinear model and deep neural networks. The proposed method employs contextual information to check the logical consistency of the curvilinear method and then, constructs a Context-aware Long Short-Term Memory (CLSTM) network that can take into account contextual variables, such as the vessel types. The proposed method can enhance the prediction accuracy while maintaining the logical consistency, through a recursive feedback loop. The implementations of the proposed approach on the Automatic Identification System (AIS) dataset, from the eastern coast of the United States of America which was collected, from November to December 2017, demonstrates the effectiveness and better compression, i.e. 80% compression ratio while maintaining the logical consistency.

"maritime ship detection using convolutional neural networks from satellite images","2021","The significance of efficient monitoring and control of marine traffic for the purpose of safety and security of the ships cannot be overemphasized in the current scenario where global trade and commerce is at its pinnacle. Various stakeholders are concerned with serious maritime issues related to hijacking of ships, illegal fishing, encroachments of sea borders, and illicit exchange of sea cargo, accidents, and military attacks. This requires an automated, accurate, fast, and robust sea monitoring system which can avoid or mitigate the negative effects of such issues. This paper proposes, implements, and evaluates a CNN based deep learning model which can accurately identify ships from the images captured from satellite images. Two models CNN Model 1 and CNN Model 2 having different architectures are trained, validated, and tested on the Airbus satellite images dataset. Both classification accuracy and loss functions are measured by varying the number of the epochs. Also, the complexity comparison of the two models is performed by measuring the training time.

"an optimized back propagation neural network for automated evaluation of health condition using sensor data","2023","Ships and other large equipment must meet strict standards for equipment integrity and operational dependability in order to perform missions. To meet this demand, one of the essential linkages is to guarantee the long-term safe and healthy functioning of their power transmission equipment. The Optimized Back Propagation Neural Network (OBPNN) technique used in this study introduces a unique method for monitoring sensor data and evaluating the health state, with the SVM being optimized using the fish swarm algorithm (FSA). A major problem that maintenance is facing nowadays is reliable fault prediction. One of the trickiest difficulties is arguably automatically modelling typical behaviour from condition monitoring data, particularly when there is little information about actual failures. A data-driven learning framework with the best bandwidth selection is suggested to address this challenge. It is based on nonparametric density estimation for outlier identification and OBPNN for normality modelling. The distance to the separating hyper plane's log-normalization is used to provide a health score that is also available. The algorithm's viability is shown by experimental findings while evaluating the progression of a major defect over time in a marine diesel engine. Improved prediction capabilities and low false positive rates on healthy data are realized.","Condition monitoring,Fault prediction,Optimized back propagation neural network,Health status assessment,Fish swarm algorithm,Machine learning,"

"optimizing cnn hyperparameters for mental fatigue assessment in demanding maritime operations","2020","Human-related issues play an important role in accidents and causalities in demanding maritime operations. The industry lacks an approach capable of preventively assessing maritime operators' mental fatigue and awareness levels before accidents happen. Aiming to reduce intrusiveness, we focused on improving the mental fatigue assessment capabilities of a combination of electroencephalogram and electrocardiogram sensors by investigating the optimization of convolutional neural networks by Bayesian optimization with Gaussian process. We proposed a mapping function to optimize the network structure without the need for a tree-like structure to define the domain of variables for the optimization process. We applied the proposed approach in a simulated vessel piloting task. Even though the mental fatigue assessment for the cross-subject case is a complex classification task, the trained convolutional neural network could achieve good generalization performance (97.6% test accuracy).

"data-driven fraud detection in international shipping","2018","Document fraud constitutes a growing problem in international shipping. Shipping documentation may be deliberately manipulated to avoid shipping restrictions or customs duties. Well-known examples of such fraud are miscoding and smuggling. These are cases in which the documentation of a shipment does not correctly or entirely describe the goods in transit. In an attempt to reduce the risks of document fraud, shipping companies and customs authorities typically perform random audits to check the accompanying documentation of shipments. Although these audits detect many fraud schemes, they are quite labor intensive and do not scale to the massive amounts of cargo that is shipped each day. This paper investigates whether intelligent fraud detection systems can improve the detection of miscoding and smuggling by analyzing large sets of historical shipment data. We develop a Bayesian network that predicts the presence of goods on the cargo list of shipments. The predictions of the Bayesian network are compared with the accompanying documentation of a shipment to determine whether document fraud is perpetrated. We also show how a set of discriminative models can be derived from the topology of the Bayesian network and perform the same fraud detection task. Our experimental results show that intelligent fraud detection systems can considerably improve the detection of miscoding and smuggling compared to random audits.","Neural networks,International shipping,Fraud detection,Logistic regression,Bayesian networks,Probablistic classification,"

"surveillance in maritime scenario using deep learning and swarm intelligence","2022","Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have played a crucial role in supporting Search and Rescue (SAR) Operations due to their fast movement capabilities and flexibility. During a search and rescue operation scenario, the time constraint is a crucial parameter, so the required time to detect humans in distress with precision is also a vital part. Modern Deep learning algorithms like CNN also aid in these missions. However, most models and datasets available focus on search and rescue missions on the ground or land. UAV-based search and rescue operations in the Maritime Scenario remain a challenge. This study focused on using deep learning algorithms such as CNN to precisely detect a human in peril with a swarm of drones. At the same time, we emphasize using swarm intelligence algorithms such as Particle Swarm Algorithm (PSO) to effectively find a victim in the shortest time by exploring a massive area. The distinctiveness of this system is that it combines the model with the best accuracy to detect and the best swarm intelligence algorithm for finding targets in the quickest time possible, thus enhancing the surveillance mission.

However, most of the existing tracking methods belong to generative models, which only focus on the features of the object and require the target has significant visual saliency for accurate tracking.

However, existing segmentation methods, primarily developed for ground vehicles, are inadequate in an aquatic environment as they produce many false positive (FP) detections in the presence of water reflections and wakes.

A deep encoder based on ResNet101 with atrous convolutions enables the extraction of rich visual features, while a novel decoder gradually fuses them with inertial information from the inertial measurement unit (IMU). The inertial information greatly improves the segmentation accuracy of the water component in the presence of visual ambiguities, such as fog on the horizon. Furthermore, a novel loss function for semantic separation is proposed to enforce the separation of different semantic components to increase the robustness of the segmentation. We investigate different loss variants and observe a significant reduction in FPs and an increase in true positives (TPs).

This dataset contains more than 1,000 paired RGB and infrared images among six ship categories - merchant, sailing, passenger, medium, tug, and small - which are salient for control and following maritime traffic regulations. We provide baseline results on this dataset using two off-the-shelf algorithms: gnostic fields and deep convolutional neural networks. Using these classifiers, we are able to achieve 87.4% mean per-class recognition accuracy during the day and 61.0% at night.","infrared spectrums,image recognition,passenger,VAIS,Cameras,Marine vehicles,Feature extraction,Neural networks,off-the-shelf algorithms,gnostic fields,neural nets,machine vision systems,deep convolutional neural networks,computer vision,tug,visible spectrums,fully autonomous seafaring vessels,merchant,Training,convolution,infrared imaging,Image resolution,Clutter,international marine traffic regulations,maritime imagery recognition,medium,sailing,dataset,"
"geotracknetâ€”a maritime anomaly detector using probabilistic neural network representation of ais tracks and a contrario detection","2022","Representing maritime traffic patterns and detecting anomalies from them are key to vessel monitoring and maritime situational awareness. We propose a novel approachâ€”referred to as GeoTrackNetâ€”for maritime anomaly detection from AIS data streams. Our model exploits state-of-the-art neural network schemes to learn a probabilistic representation of AIS tracks and a contrario detection to detect abnormal events. The neural network provides a new means to capture complex and heterogeneous patterns in vesselsâ€™ behaviours, while the a contrario detector takes into account the fact that the learnt distribution may be location-dependent. Experiments on a real AIS dataset comprising more than 4.2 million AIS messages demonstrate the relevance of the proposed method compared with state-of-the-art schemes.","heterogeneous patterns,motion estimation,GeoTrackNet,naval engineering computing,Anomaly detection,Geospatial analysis,anomaly detection,probabilistic representation,variational recurrent neural networks,AIS messages,maritime traffic patterns,maritime anomaly detector,AIS dataset,maritime situational awareness,neural nets,probabilistic neural network representation,deep learning,ships,marine engineering,AIS data streams,complex patterns,contrario detection,AIS,maritime surveillance,object detection,Probabilistic logic,a contrario detection,Artificial intelligence,maritime anomaly detection,Trajectory,Task analysis,vessel monitoring,contrario detector,learning (artificial intelligence),state-of-the-art neural network schemes,Detectors,AIS tracks,"
"maritime radar target detection using neural networks","1995","Two neural network based maritime radar target detection systems are presented: one is based on a backpropagation (BP) network and the other on the combination of a principal component analysis (PCA) network and a BP network. Using maritime radar images as inputs, both systems include a pre-processing stage, a BP network classification stage and a post-processing stage. In the PCA+BP network based system, an extra PCA network is used for compacting test patterns. Experimental results show that: (a) for the BP network based system, the overall detection rate is 95.3%; (b) for the PCA+BP network based system, the same overall detection rate can be reached with a reduced number of false-alarms; (c) as the number of components of compacted data from the PCA network is reduced, the overall detection rate is maintained at nearly the same level; and (d) compared with a conventional mean-level constant false-alarm rate detector, the two neural network based systems can provide higher overall detection rates while maintaining a lower number of false-alarms.","test patterns,radar detection,neural networks,Neural networks,transforms,Principal component analysis,experimental results,neural nets,marine systems,radar computing,maritime radar images,Artificial neural networks,false alarms,preprocessing stage,postprocessing stage,maritime radar target detection systems,radar imaging,Artificial intelligence,Radar clutter,backpropagation network,detection rate,principal component analysis network,Radar imaging,backpropagation network classifier,Object detection,Surveillance,Detectors,Radar detection,backpropagation,"

"experimental comparison of ad hoc methods for classification of maritime vessels based on real-life ais data","2018","Classification of Maritime Vessels is a recurrent task in maritime surveillance systems. Classification can be conducted by different methods, e.g., NaÃ¯ve Bayes, k Nearest Neighbor, Decision Tree, Fuzzy Rule, or Neural Networks. The Automatic Identification System (AIS) is cooperative system of VHF-radio data exchange. By broadcasting of navigational data and ships' information it supports maritime safety, surveillance, and information. Based on measured AIS datasets of five maritime hotspots, easily implementable standard classification (i.e. ad hoc) methods from Data Science are compared to each other. These are evaluated in terms of accuracy. This experimental evaluation is motivated by the following question: Tip to which degree properties and behavior, e.g., vessel's type, can be detected by using large quantities of ship's positional, motion, and dimensions' data as provided by AIS? Future applications might include detection of fraudulent self-declarations of types, e.g., during illegal fishing activities.","surveillance,maritime surveillances systems,Fuzzy Rule,Nearest Neighbor,maritime vessels,Neural networks,Data Science,experimental comparison,Decision Tree,Decision trees,Neural Network,ad hoc methods,real-life AIS data,ships,marine safety,marine engineering,Automatic Identification System,AIS,Ions,pattern classification,NaÃ¯ve Bayes,Artificial intelligence,navigational data,maritime surveillance systems,Training,maritime hotspots,VHF radio propagation,KNIME Analytics Platform,VHF-radio data exchange,radio data systems,Surveillance,Classification,accuracy,Task analysis,performance evaluation,maritime safety,"
"automated monitoring in maritime video surveillance system","2020","Maritime surveillance for intruders/illegal activities requires monitoring of a large area of the coastline. This task being manually exhaustive, would benefit immensely by application of object detection techniques to surveillance videos. However, object detection models trained on general objects datasets cannot be expected to give best performance for this scenario as marine vessels are only a small subset of these huge datasets and also do not classify the specific type of sea vehicle. Hence, their benchmarks are not appropriate for maritime surveillance. Some studies have been done with applications of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for ship/boat detection on private and publicly available sea vessels datasets. This paper presents a summary of the benchmarks so far and presents our experiments of the latest object detection techniques for combined marine vessels dataset. A survey of the currently available datasets is also given. Results of our experiments in terms of mean Average Precision (mAP) and Frames Per Second (FPS) are presented.","Benchmark testing,object detection models,surveillance videos,sea vehicle,computerised monitoring,Meteorology,Videos,ships,marine engineering,Marine vessel identification,boats,object detection,Intruder detection,Video surveillance,convolutional neural nets,convolutional neural networks,general objects datasets,private sea vessels datasets,automated monitoring,Ship detection,Deep learning,Object detection,Computational modeling,Task analysis,video surveillance,marine vessels dataset,maritime video surveillance,"
"leveraging graph and deep learning uncertainties to detect anomalous maritime trajectories","2022","Understanding and representing traffic patterns are key to detecting anomalous trajectories in the transportation domain. However, some trajectories can exhibit heterogeneous maneuvering characteristics despite confining to normal patterns. Thus, we propose a novel graph-based trajectory representation and association scheme for extraction and confederation of traffic movement patterns, such that data patterns and uncertainty can be learned by deep learning (DL) models. This paper proposes the usage of a recurrent neural network (RNN)-based evidential regression model, which can predict trajectory at future timesteps as well as estimate the data and model uncertainties associated, to detect anomalous maritime trajectories, such as unusual vessel maneuvering, using automatic identification system (AIS) data. Furthermore, we utilize evidential deep learning classifiers to detect unusual turns of vessels and the loss of transmitted signal using predicted class probabilities with associated uncertainties. Our experimental results suggest that the graphical representation of traffic patterns improves the ability of the DL models, such as evidential and Monte Carlo dropout, to learn the temporal-spatial correlation of data and associated uncertainties. Using different datasets and experiments, we demonstrate that the estimated prediction uncertainty yields fundamental information for the detection of traffic anomalies in the maritime and, possibly in other domains.","Monte Carlo methods,classification,recurrent neural nets,graph,deep learning (artificial intelligence),Anomaly detection,DL models,graph-based trajectory representation,automatic identification system data,Monte Carlo dropout,graphical representation,traffic movement patterns,detect anomalous maritime trajectories,Predictive models,regression analysis,evidential deep learning,marine engineering,Data models,data patterns,pattern classification,Artificial intelligence,graph theory,RNN,regression,clustering,uncertainty,Trajectory,Uncertainty,probability,Computational modeling,traffic engineering computing,recurrent neural network-based evidential regression model,deep learning uncertainties,AIS data,"
"rainfall prediction of a maritime state (kerala), india using slfn and elm techniques","2017","This paper presents variable monsoon trends over Kerala in winter, pre-monsoon, summer monsoon and post-monsoon periods. The decreasing trends in seasonal rainfall and post-monsoon rainfall and increasing occurrence of the deficit rainfall years indicates the probable intensification of water scarcity in Kerala. Artificial intelligent methods like Single layer Feed-Forward Neural Network (SLFN) and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) were used to predict the summer monsoon rainfall as heavy rainfall occurs during this period in the state. The proposed SLFN network prediction model provides 6.3977% of mean absolute error whereas ELM provides 3.8729% of error. ELM is better as compared to SLFN and can be used as a prediction tool for analyzing complex monsoon phenomena.","complex monsoon phenomena,ELM,Kerala,rain,deficit rainfall years,artificial intelligent methods,maritime state,pre-monsoon,heavy rainfall,seasonal rainfall,Predictive models,extreme learning machine,trend,neural nets,Artificial neural networks,Monsoons,variable monsoon trends,prediction tool,decreasing trends,geophysics computing,rainfall,post-monsoon periods,Single layer Feed-Forward Neural Network,summer monsoon rainfall,artificial neural network,Training,SLFN network prediction model,Market research,monsoons,rainfall prediction,learning (artificial intelligence),prediction,Biological neural networks,feedforward neural nets,post-monsoon rainfall,"
"loitering behavior detection and classification of vessel movements based on trajectory shape and convolutional neural networks","2022","To improve the ability of ship behavior detection in maritime safety surveillance, a new ship behavior of frequent turning within a certain spatial range, called ship loitering, was found under the ship behavior framework of 'anchored-off, straight-sailing, turning'. The concept of trajectory redundancy is defined as the quantitative representation of trajectory characteristics of ship loitering. A multi-scale sliding window-based ship loitering detection method is designed to process ship trajectories with different spatial ranges and time duration. Further, a shape recognition model based on a convolutional neural network is constructed and trained to identify four typical shapes of loitering trajectories. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, experiments were conducted using the AIS trajectory data collected from the sea off the Strait of Juan de Fuca in the eastern North Pacific Ocean in 2017 and validated against the manual labeling results. The results illustrate that six general categories of ships produce loitering behaviors with different intentions. The characteristics of the spatial-temporal distribution of ship loitering behaviors can be represented as different shapes. The average precision of ship loitering detection reaches 96.5% and the average accuracy of four typical loitering trajectory shapes reaches 86.2%.","Convolutional neural network (CNN),Loitering behavior,Ship trajectory,Automatic identification system (AIS),Sliding window,"
"deep cnn supported recognition of ship using sar images in maritime environment","2021","In this paper, we have proposed a method to recognize the ship using Synthetic Aperture Radar(SAR) images. The ability of SAR to form radar images independent of any weather conditions and with large swath width made this monitoring technique very well suited for maritime surveillance. The dataset used for the recognition of ships using SAR images consists of three classes for classification. We have used a Deep Convolution Neural Network(CNN) for the recognition of ships from SAR images. The network is trained rigorously and after testing the sample data with a well-trained network we achieved an accuracy of 90 percent.","SAR images,ship,Synthetic Aperture Radar(SAR),efficiency 90.0 percent,radar computing,maritime surveillance,Image recognition,synthetic aperture radar,radar images,radar imaging,Radar polarimetry,synthetic aperture radar images,convolutional neural nets,Optical interferometry,maritime environment,Image resolution,Radar imaging,Surveillance,Signal processing algorithms,weather conditions,Deep Convolution Neural Network(CNN),deep convolution neural network,deep CNN supported recognition,"
"maritime atr using classifier combination and high resolution range profiles","2011","A maritime automatic target recognition system is developed that performs ship classification using one-dimensional high resolution range profiles. Five physically based features are defined and are extracted from both VV and HH polarizations resulting in a 10-dimensional feature vector. A nonlinear classifier combination approach involving a neural network combiner along with three individual classifiers (Bayes, nearest neighbor, and neural network) is proposed. A decision confidence measure based on the classifier discriminants is developed using a nonparametric estimation approach. The confidence measure enables the system to reject samples that have a low decision confidence. The performance of the proposed neural network based combination is compared with individual classifiers and a number of other combination rules. The results show that this combination can provide high recognition accuracy along with a high probability of declaration. The performance in the presence of samples from not-before-seen classes is also investigated. A new nearest neighbor confidence thresholding approach is developed to aid the neural network combiner in rejecting these samples.","Automatic test equipment,classifier discriminant,polarization,Bayes classifier,marine radar,Bayes methods,Marine vehicles,Feature extraction,nonlinear classifier combination approach,decision confidence measure,ships,nearest neighbor classifier,marine engineering,neural network classifier,Target tracking,radar target recognition,synthetic aperture radar,pattern classification,search radar,feature vector,Classification algorithms,nonparametric estimation approach,maritime automatic target recognition system,decision theory,nearest neighbor confidence thresholding approach,vectors,maritime surveillance radar,neural network combiner,high resolution range profiles,radar resolution,ship classification,polarisation,inverse synthetic aperture radar,Radar detection,"
