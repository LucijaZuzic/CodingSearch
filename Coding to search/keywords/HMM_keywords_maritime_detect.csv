"vessel track information mining using ais data","2014","In recent years, vessel traffic and maritime situation awareness become more and more important for countries across the world. AIS data contains much information about vessel motion and reflects traffic characteristics. In this paper, data mining is introduced to discover motion patterns of vessel movements. Firstly, we do statistical analysis for large scale of AIS data. Secondly, we use association rules to analyze the frequent moving status of vessels. We extend the dimensions of data features, improve the algorithm in efficiency and import the concept of time scale in the algorithm based on the previous relative work. Thirdly, we introduce Markov model to make supplement for the association rules. The prediction results in the Markov process are further used to do the anomaly detection. The method in this paper provides novel idea for the research in AIS data and the management of maritime traffic.","Markov processes,data mining,Clustering algorithms,Association rules,vessel movements,Hidden Markov models,anomaly detection,Marine vehicles,Markov model,vessel traffic,maritime traffic management,statistical analysis,motion patterns,association rules,Data models,Markov,traffic information systems,vessel track information mining,traffic characteristics,maritime situation awareness,frequent moving status,vessel motion,marine vehicles,AIS data,"
"maritime situation analysis framework: vessel interaction classification and anomaly detection","2015","Maritime domain awareness is critical for protecting sea lanes, ports, harbors, offshore structures like oil and gas rigs and other types of critical infrastructure against common threats and illegal activities. Typical examples range from smuggling of drugs and weapons, human trafficking and piracy all the way to terror attacks. Limited surveillance resources constrain maritime domain awareness and compromise full security coverage at all times. This situation calls for innovative intelligent systems for interactive situation analysis to assist marine authorities and security personal in their routine surveillance operations. In this article, we propose a novel situation analysis approach to analyze marine traffic data and differentiate various scenarios of vessel engagement for the purpose of detecting anomalies of interest for marine vessels that operate over some period of time in relative proximity to each other. We consider such scenarios as probabilistic processes and analyze complex vessel trajectories using machine learning to model common patterns. Specifically, we represent patterns as left-to-right Hidden Markov Models and classify them using Support Vector Machines. To differentiate suspicious activities from unobjectionable behavior, we explore fusion of data and information, including kinematic features, geospatial features, contextual information and maritime domain knowledge. Our experimental evaluation shows the effectiveness of the proposed approach using comprehensive real-world vessel tracking data from coastal waters of North America.","Kinematics,surveillance,hidden Markov models,interactive situation analysis,Hidden Markov models,Geospatial analysis,anomaly detection,Anomaly Detection,maritime domain awareness,marine traffic data analysis,data fusion,information fusion,data analysis,Maritime Domain Awareness,vessel engagement,routine surveillance operations,marine engineering,support vector machines,kinematic features,probabilistic processes,geospatial features,machine learning,left-to-right hidden Markov models,vessel interaction classification,innovative intelligent systems,pattern classification,contextual information,Time series analysis,maritime situation analysis framework,Critical Infrastructure Protection,Big Data,vessel tracking data,Trajectory,Machine Learning,probability,complex vessel trajectory analysis,pattern representation,traffic engineering computing,Surveillance,maritime domain knowledge,marine vehicles,Intelligent Systems,learning (artificial intelligence),Security,security,"
"enabling maritime risk assessment using natural language processing-based deep learning techniques","2020","Maritime vessels around the world risk encountering dangerous situations during their voyages such as piracy, kidnappings, hijackings, and smugglings. Such dangers may put crews at risk and potentially cause extensive damage to both the vessel and its cargo. Maritime risk assessment is a process of analyzing such factors to positively impact the safety and timeliness of operations. Analyzing the high-risk areas in seas and oceans can help vessels route around areas with previously recorded high levels of dangerous activities. This information is scraped and extracted from various maritime documents, including newspaper articles, social media, incident blogs, and operational reports. After textual data sources are parsed, it is possible to use this extracted information as training datasets into a Machine Learning (ML) model using Natural Language Processing (NLP) Deep Learning (DL) techniques. With these methods, we can perform document classification, risk extraction, text summarization, topic modeling, and information extraction in an automated manner. Methods that are used include the bag-of words (BOW) approach and, in particular, the use of Named Entity Recognition (NER) to identify specific areas around the world that are considered a risk to a particular voyage. Once this information is processed, the model can determine and aggregate specific areas of high-risk activity. We propose a Maritime Event Log (MEL) pipeline using DL methods. This pipeline includes binary document classification (DC) to extract positive instances of incidents, an incident type classification (IC,) and an information extraction module (IE) including date and location and ship type extraction. With such information available, it is possible to avoid dangerous situations, which may have a significant level of impact on the safety and success rate of maritime operations.","Bit error rate,Pipelines,newspaper articles,Text categorization,Hidden Markov models,deep learning (artificial intelligence),Information retrieval,machine learning model,maritime vessels,information retrieval,natural language processing,maritime risk assessment,safety,bag-of words approach,high-risk activity,information extraction module,ships,marine safety,marine engineering,maritime event log pipeline,vessels route,operational reports,ship type extraction,named entity recognition,risk management,pattern classification,incident type classification,Classification algorithms,maritime documents,text summarization,incident blogs,Training,risk extraction,textual data sources,text analysis,deep learning techniques,social media,maritime operations,binary document classification,topic modeling,"
"maritime anomaly detection in ferry tracks","2017","This paper proposes a methodology for the automatic detection of anomalous shipping tracks traced by ferries. The approach comprises a set of models as a basis for outlier detection: A Gaussian process (GP) model regresses displacement information collected over time, and a Markov chain based detector makes use of the direction (heading) information. GP regression is performed together with Median Absolute Deviation to account for contaminated training data. The methodology utilizes the coordinates of a given ferry recorded on a second by second basis via Automatic Identification System. Its effectiveness is demonstrated on a dataset collected in the Solent area.","Markov processes,automatic anomalous shipping track detection,Hidden Markov models,unsupervised learning,Marine vehicles,Anomaly Detection,ferry tracks,Markov chain based detector,marine navigation,Gaussian Processes,heading information,displacement information regression,regression analysis,outlier detection,data analysis,Median Absolute Deviation,object tracking,ships,ferry coordinates,automatic identification system,direction information,Training data,Gaussian processes,traffic information systems,Artificial intelligence,median absolute deviation,maritime anomaly detection,Solent area,Maritime Traffic,Gaussian process model,Detectors,"
"risk-driven intent assessment and response generation in maritime surveillance operations","2015","Decision support systems (DSSs) are playing an increasingly important role in the characterization of suspicious activities in an area of interest given their proved ability to turn vast amounts of raw data into actionable intelligence that is easy to understand by human operators. Although risk management is an integral component of the decision making process that directly contributes towards improved situational awareness and response assessment, an active end-to-end consideration of the underlying risk sources in the environment is still an important feature that most DSSs currently lack. Additionally, deciding on an appropriate course of action (COA) to mitigate emerging threats in the system is a challenging task even for domain experts given that (1) the number of potential responses to analyze could be overwhelmingly large; (2) seldom are those responses judged in terms of the risks associated with their enactment and (3) assessing the effectiveness of the potential responses in the real world is usually time-consuming and simulation-driven. In this paper, we formalize the adaptation of a recently proposed Risk Management Framework to account for behavioral intents associated with the objects of interest (OOIs) in the monitoring environment and their link to automatic response generation. The intent of the objects is inferred from high-level cognitive and behavioral knowledge in the form of anomalies. When an OOI has crossed a permissible risk threshold, we demonstrate how responses to that situation can be automatically elicited by the COA recommendation module of a risk-aware DSS. Multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) is used to judge a diverse set of plausible responses according to different operational objectives. We illustrate the application of the proposed framework in the context of maritime surveillance operations by triggering a corporate search for a missing vessel. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that risk features are synthesized from anomalies and integrated into a more comprehensive RMF engine for knowledge (response) elicitation.","decision support systems,surveillance,automatic response generation,Risk management,Hidden Markov models,risk-aware DSS,Conferences,Feature extraction,behavioral knowledge,intent and threat assessment,Meteorology,marine systems,marine safety,COA recommendation module,cognitive knowledge,behavioral intents,risk management,operations research,MCDA,situational awareness,risk-driven response generation,course of action recommendation,high-level information fusion,course of action,RMF engine,Decision support systems,objects of interest,multicriteria decision making,maritime surveillance operations,multicriteria decision analysis,corporate search,OOI,risk management framework,Surveillance,risk-driven intent assessment,"
"maritime threat detection using plan recognition","2012","Existing algorithms for maritime threat detection employ a variety of normalcy models that are probabilistic and/or rule-based. Unfortunately, they can be limited in their ability to model the subtlety and complexity of multiple vessel types and their spatio-temporal events, yet their representation is needed to accurately detect anomalies in maritime scenarios. To address these limitations, we apply plan recognition algorithms for maritime anomaly detection. In particular, we examine hierarchical task network (HTN) and case-based algorithms for plan recognition, which detect anomalies by generating expected behaviors for use as a basis for threat detection. We compare their performance with a behavior recognition algorithm on simulated riverine maritime traffic. On a set of simulated maritime scenarios, these plan recognition algorithms outperformed the behavior recognition algorithm, except for one reactive behavior task in which the inverse occurred. Furthermore, our case-based plan recognizer outperformed our HTN algorithm. On the short-term reactive planning scenarios, the plan recognition algorithms outperformed the behavior recognition algorithm on routine plan following. However, they are significantly outperformed on the anomalous scenarios.","planning,plan recognition algorithms,maritime threat detection,Hidden Markov models,multiple vessel types,naval engineering,Prediction algorithms,routine plan,Planning,simulated maritime scenarios,hierarchical task network,Accuracy,normalcy models,marine systems,short-term reactive planning scenarios,HTN algorithm,case-based plan recognizer,Collision avoidance,Probabilistic logic,spatio-temporal events,case-based algorithms,maritime anomaly detection,reactive behavior task,behavior recognition algorithm,national security,Labeling,case-based reasoning,simulated riverine maritime traffic,"
"dltif: deep learning-driven cyber threat intelligence modeling and identification framework in iot-enabled maritime transportation systems","2023","The recent burgeoning of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies in the maritime industry is successfully digitalizing Maritime Transportation Systems (MTS). In IoT-enabled MTS, the smart maritime objects, infrastructure associated with ship or port communicate wirelessly using an open channel Internet. The intercommunication and incorporation of heterogeneous technologies in IoT-enabled MTS brings opportunities not only for the industries that embrace it, but also for cyber-criminals. Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) is an effective security strategy that uses artificial intelligence models to understand cyber-attacks and can protect data of IoT-enabled MTS proficiently. Unsurprisingly, most of the existing CTI-based solutions uses manual analysis to extract relevant threat information, and has low detection and high false alarm rate. Therefore, to tackle aforementioned challenges, an automated framework called DLTIF is developed for modeling cyber threat intelligence and identifying threat types. The proposed DLTIF is based on three schemes: a deep feature extractor (DFE), CTI-driven detection (CTIDD) and CTI-attack type identification (CTIATI). The DFE scheme automatically extracts the hidden patterns of IoT-enabled MTS network and its output is used by CTIDD scheme for threat detection. The CTIATI scheme is designed to identify the exact threat types and to assist security analysts in giving early warning and adopt defensive strategies. The proposed framework has obtained upto 99% accuracy, and outperforms some traditional and recent state-of-the-art approaches.","cyber-attacks,deep feature extractor,Cyber-attack,cyber threat intelligence,computer network security,threat type identification,identification framework,Hidden Markov models,deep learning (artificial intelligence),maritime transportation systems (MTS),computer crime,Internet of Things,transportation,CTI-driven detection,ship,cyber-physical systems,Feature extraction,the Internet of Things (IoT),blockchains,CTI-attack type identification,DLTIF,deep learning,heterogeneous technologies,ships,deep learning-driven cyber threat intelligence modeling,Data models,cyber-criminals,feature extraction,IoT-enabled MTS network,artificial intelligence models,Logic gates,CTI-attack,defensive strategies,marine engineering computing,exact threat types,smart maritime objects,maritime industry,open channel Internet,Internet,artificial intelligence,Data mining,IoT-enabled maritime transportation systems,threat detection,Analytical models,"
"the usefulness of artificial intelligence for safety assessment of different transport modes","2023","Recent research in transport safety focuses on the processing of large amounts of available data by means of intelligent systems, in order to decrease the number of accidents for transportation users. Several Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications have been developed to address safety problems and improve efficiency of transportation systems. However exchange of knowledge between transport modes has been limited. This paper reviews the ML and AI methods used in different transport modes (road, rail, maritime and aviation) to address safety problems, in order to identify good practices and experiences that can be transferable between transport modes. The methods examined include statistical and econometric methods, algorithmic approaches, classification and clustering methods, artificial neural networks (ANN) as well as optimization and dimension reduction techniques. Our research reveals the increasing interest of transportation researchers and practitioners in AI applications for crash prediction, incident/failure detection, pattern identification, driver/operator or route assistance, as well as optimization problems. The most popular and efficient methods used in all transport modes are ANN, SVM, Hidden Markov Models and Bayesian models. The type of the analytical technique is mainly driven by the purpose of the safety analysis performed. Finally, a wider variety of AI and ML methodologies is observed in road transport mode, which also appears to concentrate a higher, and constantly increasing, number of studies compared to the other modes.","Machine Learning,Transportation Modes,Transportation Safety,Artificial Intelligence,"

"textual risk mining for maritime situational awareness","2014","In this paper, we propose an auxiliary Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) integrated system for maritime situational awareness (MSA) operations. We bring into account a new and influential asset - human intuition and perception - to the existing semi-automated decision support systems that mostly rely on numerical data collected by electronic sensors or cameras located either directly on the vessels or in the maritime command-and-control centers. For our project, we gathered weekly textual reports spanning twelve months from the United States Worldwide Threats to Shipping Reports repository that belongs to the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), We considered the maritime incident reports written by human operators as a valuable and accessible unstructured textual input source in which a span of text1 is called â€œriskâ€ if it expresses one of the following kinds of vessel incidents: fired, robbed, boarded, hijacked, attacked, chased, approached, kidnapped, boarding attempted, suspiciously approached or clashed with. Our approach benefits from probability distributions of some useful features annotated based on a list of lexicons that contain expressions denoting vessel types, risks types, risk associates, maritime geographical locations, dates and times. These distributions are captured and used to anchor the span of â€œrisksâ€ as they are described in the textual reports. After some preprocessing steps that include tokenization, named entity extraction and part-of-speech tagging, the textual risk mining system applies a variety of sequence classification algorithms, e.g., Conditional Random Fields, Conditional Markov Models and Hidden Markov Models in order to compare the risk classification performance. Empirical results show that our NLP/ML-based system can extract variable-length risk spans from the textual reports with about 90% correctness.","Markov processes,decision support systems,hidden Markov models,statistical distributions,tokenization,Risk management,attacked vessel incident,human intuition,Hidden Markov models,maritime geographical locations,conditional Markov models,maritime domain awareness,maritime command-and-control centers,Feature extraction,natural language processing,chased vessel incident,entity extraction,variable-length risk span extraction,maritime incident reports,maritime situational awareness,sequence classification algorithms,conditional random fields,robbed vessel incident,electronic sensors,United States worldwide threats to shipping reports repository,maritime situational awareness operation,fired vessel incident,marine safety,National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency,marine engineering,boarded vessel incident,feature annotation,machine learning,semiautomated decision support systems,cameras,part-of-speech tagging,risk management,NLP/ML-based system,Classification algorithms,probability distributions,risks types,risk classification performance,textual risk mining system,weekly textual reports,auxiliary ML,auxiliary machine learning,hijacked vessel incident,command and control systems,vessels,human perception,vessel types,MSA operation,kidnapped vessel incident,risk associates,risk detection,NGA,text analysis,boarding attempted vessel incident,approached vessel incident,Data mining,learning (artificial intelligence),sequence-based classifiers,"
"fuzzy/human risk analysis for maritime situational awareness and decision support","2017","Human computation (HC) is an active research field in which people play a notable role as computational elements in an automated system with the aim of arriving at a truly symbiotic human-computer interaction. Situational awareness (SA) and decision support systems (DSSs) are two domains where human computation is rapidly advancing, with the latter arising as an invaluable vehicle to achieve the former. Fuzzy systems and fuzzy logic are two commonly employed tools in these domains due to their inherent capabilities of representing and processing vague and imprecise information while conveying the analysis results in an interpretable fashion. In this paper, we elaborate on the human computation aspects of risk analysis within SA and DSS conducted with the aid of fuzzy sets.

"bidirectional data-driven trajectory prediction for intelligent maritime traffic","2023","Intelligent maritime transportation is one of the most promising enabling technologies for promoting trade efficiency and releasing the physical labor force. The trajectory prediction method is the foundation to guarantee collision avoidance and route optimization for ship transportation. This article proposes a bidirectional data-driven trajectory prediction method based on Automatic Identification System (AIS) spatio-temporal data to improve the accuracy of ship trajectory prediction and reduce the risk of accidents. Our study constructs an encoder-decoder network driven by a forward and reverse comprehensive historical trajectory and then fuses the characteristics of the sub-network to predict the ship trajectory. The AIS historical trajectory data of US West Coast ships are employed to investigate the feasibility of the proposed method. Compared with the current methods, the proposed approach lessens the prediction error by studying the comprehensive historical trajectory, and 60.28% has reduced the average prediction error. The ocean and port trajectory data are analyzed in maritime transportation before and after COVID-19. The prediction error in the port area is reduced by 95.17% than the data before the epidemic.

To gain the trust of the operator, it is important to develop a robust system, which gives the operator enough insight to take a rational choice about future steps. In this work, the maritime domain is investigated. Here, anomalies occur in trajectory data. Hence, a normal model for the trajectories has to be estimated. Despite the goal of anomaly detection in real life operations, until today, mostly simulated anomalies have been evaluated to measure the performance of different algorithms. Therefore, an annotation tool is developed to provide a ground truth on a non-simulative dataset. The annotated data is used to compare different algorithms with each other.

"deep learning-powered vessel trajectory prediction for improving smart traffic services in maritime internet of things","2022","The maritime Internet of Things (IoT) has recently emerged as a revolutionary communication paradigm where a large number of moving vessels are closely interconnected in intelligent maritime networks. However, the tremendous growth of vessel trajectories, collected from the combined satellite-terrestrial AIS (automatic identification system) base stations, could lead to unsatisfactory maritime safety and efficacy. To promote smart traffic services in maritime IoT, it is necessary to accurately and robustly predict the spatiotemporal vessel trajectories. It is beneficial for collision avoidance, maritime surveillance, and abnormal behavior detection, etc. Motivated by the strong learning capacity of deep neural networks, this work proposes an AIS data-driven trajectory prediction framework, whose main component is a long short term memory (LSTM) network. In particular, the vessel traffic conflict situation modeling, generated using the dynamic AIS data and social force concept, is embedded into the LSTM network to guarantee high-accuracy vessel trajectory prediction. In addition, a mixed loss function is reconstructed to make our prediction results more reliable and robust in different navigation environments.

"anomalous behavior detection of marine vessels based on hidden markov model","2018","In recent years, marine traffic has increased dramatically. Therefore, some vessels may show abnormal behaviors which may indicate different dangers or threats, and also decreases the marine security. These abnormal behaviors are called anomalies.

"maritime anomaly detection and threat assessment","2010","Ships involved in commercial activities tend to follow set patterns of behaviour depending on the business in which they are engaged. If a ship exhibits anomalous behaviour, this could indicate it is being used for illicit activities. With the wide availability of automatic identification system (AIS) data it is now possible to detect some of these patterns of behaviour. Monitoring the possible threat posed by the worldwide movement of ships, however, requires efficient and robust automatic data processing to create a priority list for further investigation. This paper outlines five anomalous ship behaviours: deviation from standard routes, unexpected AIS activity, unexpected port arrival, close approach, and zone entry. For each behaviour, a process is described for determining the probability that it is anomalous.

"lmd-tshipâ‹†: vision based large-scale maritime ship tracking benchmark for autonomous navigation applications","2021","Accurate ship tracking is very important for the security of maritime activities, especially the raising requirements of autonomous navigation applications, e.g., autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs). Unlike deep-learning-based object-tracking methods are prevailing in autonomous driving because of good environmental robustness and high tracking accuracy, few deep-tracking models can be found for maritime ships. The main reason for that is the lack of qualified ship datasets, especially datasets with ship-based perspectives. Therefore, a large-scale, high-definition dataset for ship tracking, LMD-TShip (Large Maritime Dataset), is provided in this paper. In this dataset, five types of ships are included, from cargo ships, fishing ships, passenger ships, and speed boats to unmanned ships. Specifically, LMD-TShip consists of 40,240 frames in 191 videos, each of which is carefully and manually annotated with bounding boxes in YOLO format. Moreover, 13 attributes are used to label videos, e.g., scale variation (SV), occlusion (OCC), basically covering tracking challenges of maritime ship tracking. Next, a detailed analysis is carried out to demonstrate the characteristics of LMD-TShip.
