"underwater archaeological investigation using ground penetrating radar: a case analysis of shanglinhu yue kiln sites (china)","2018","In this study we explored the possibility and effectiveness of applying ground penetrating radar (GPR) to investigate underwater cultural relics. Using this innovative technique, the remains of Yue kiln and anomalous objects buried beneath the lake or suspended in the water can now be fully studied. Although GPR has been widely used for imaging archaeological sites, skepticism remains over its use in underwater archaeology. Nevertheless, some scholars suggest that it is possible to use GPR to detect underwater remains, which has been further confirmed by the use of electrical parameter measurement (EPM) in Shanglinhu Lake. An experiment was performed by our team using antennas of different frequencies in a particular area of the lake. The results showed that the penetrability of the 100 MHz antenna was enough to examine the targets, while the 400 MHz antenna performed well in shallow water (depth <4 m) due to higher resolution. Hence, for our underwater investigation, we used both antennas for maximum coverage. We used a radargram as a topographic map which shows cross sections of the lake. Analysis of the Shanglinhu Lake data indicated that GPR is a superior tool for underwater archaeological investigation. Traditional methods including sonar, underwater cameras and salvage dives were used as supporting techniques in the study.","Underwater archaeological investigation,Ground penetrating radar,Yue kiln remains,"
"abnormal moving speed detection using combination of kernel density estimator and dbscan for coastal surveillance radars","2020","In this paper, we investigate the problem of detection of abnormal moving speeds for a coastal surveillance radar. A new definition of normal moving speeds which is based on the historical radar data of maritime targets on the monitoring area is introduced. The historical radar data is mined by the cell-based method, unsupervised machine learning to obtain the vessel normal moving speeds in the monitoring area. Then a logic rule is applied to detect the abnormal targets. The proposed method is tested with real data from a coastal surveillance radar. The test results show that the false alarm rate (FAR) is equal zero. It is also shown that this kind of anomaly detection can be integrated into a coastal surveillance radar for the detection of the maritime illegal activities.","data mining,coastal surveillance radar,vessel normal moving speeds,Kernel,marine radar,unsupervised machine learning,radar detection,Kernel Density Estimator,unsupervised learning,maritime illegal activities,anomaly detection,false alarm rate,Sea measurements,Abnormal Moving Speed,DBSCAN,radar computing,cell-based method,abnormal targets,Maritime Anomaly Detection,maritime targets,search radar,Radar,radar signal processing,abnormal moving speed detection,Surveillance,learning (artificial intelligence),Radar signal processing,monitoring area,historical radar data,Radar detection,"
"maritime anomaly detection in a real-world scenario: ever given grounding in the suez canal","2022","In this paper we present how automatic maritime anomaly detection tools can be successfully applied in real-world situations such as the major event of the container vessel Ever Given, which grounded in the Suez Canal on March 23rd 2021. The anomaly detector is designed to process the available sequence of Automatic Identification System (AIS) reports, information from ground-based or satellite radar systems if available, and contextual information defining the expected nominal behavior of navigation. A statistical hypothesis testing procedure is sequentially run to decide whether or not a deviation from the nominal behavior happened within a specific time period, for instance two consecutive data points. We show, based on the recorded AIS data from the Ever Given, that the proposed detector could have been triggered and alerted to anomalous behavior fully 19 minutes before the grounding.","anomaly detector,Anomaly detection,Marine vehicles,Grounding,statistical hypothesis testing,Ever Given grounding,automatic maritime anomaly detection tools,statistical analysis,Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process,Testing,ships,Containers,automatic identification system,radar,maritime surveillance,satellite radar systems,contextual information,container vessel,Suez Canal,Artificial intelligence,ground-based system,marine engineering computing,Maritime anomaly detection,Irrigation,statistical hypothesis testing procedure,expected nominal behavior,AIS data,"
"attacking (and defending) the maritime radar system","2023","The operation of radar equipment is one of the key facilities navigators use to gather situational awareness about their surroundings. With an ever-increasing need for always-running logistics and tighter shipping schedules, operators rely more on computerized instruments and their indications. As a result, modern ships have become complex cyber-physical systems in which sensors and computers constantly communicate and coordinate. In this work, we discuss novel threats related to the radar system, one of a shipâ€™s most security-sensitive components. In detail, we first discuss some new attacks capable of compromising the integrity of data displayed on a radar system, with potentially catastrophic impacts on the crewâ€™s situational awareness or safety. Then, we present a detection system to highlight anomalies in the radar video feed, requiring no modifications to the target ship configuration. Finally, we stimulate our detection system by performing the attacks inside a simulated environment. The experimental results indicate that the attacks are feasible, easy to carry out, and hard to detect. Moreover, they prove that the proposed detection technique is effective.","computer network security,detection system,tighter shipping schedules,Radar antennas,complex cyber-physical systems,radar equipment,security-sensitive components,Marine vehicles,Radar equipment,target ship configuration,cyber-physical systems,marine navigation,security of data,radar video feed,logistics,computerized instruments,key facilities navigators,Standards,ships,sensors,situational awareness,Radar,modern ships,crew,maritime radar system,Navigation,network security,Radar detection,"
"anomaly based sea-surface small target detection using k-nearest neighbor classification","2020","Sea-surface small target detection is always a difficult problem in high-resolution maritime ubiquitous radars for complex characteristics of sea clutter, weak target returns, and diversity of targets. Multiple features extracted from radar returns in different domains have ability but not enough to solely distinguish radar returns with target from sea clutter. Joint exploitation of multiple features becomes the key to improve detection performance. In this article, the K-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm and anomaly detection idea are cooperated to develop a novel sea-surface target detection method in the feature space spanned by the eight existing salient features. The detection is realized by the anomaly detection followed by a specially designed KNN-based classifier with a controllable false alarm rate. In the anomaly detection, a decision region is determined by the hyper-spherical coverage of the training set of sea clutter that is sufficient and ergodic in the feature space. The KNN-based classifier is designed based on the training sample set of sea clutter and the training sample set of simulated target returns plus sea clutter that is sufficient but nonergodic, by joint usage of feature weighting, neighbor weighting, and distance weighting. The novel method is validated by the two open and recognized IPIX and CSIR radar databases for sea-surface small target detection. The results show that it provides significant performance improvement in comparison with the existing multiple-feature-based detection methods, owing to the fact that the novel method avoids the dimension restriction and feature compression loss in the existing methods.","k-nearest neighbor algorithm,feature compression loss,IPIX radar databases,marine radar,high-resolution maritime ubiquitous radars,Anomaly detection,radar detection,radar clutter,KNN-based classifier design,anomaly based sea-surface,neighbor algorithm,Feature extraction,sea clutter,radar computing,anomaly detection idea,object detection,feature extraction,CSIR radar databases,weak target return simulation,K-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier with controllable false alarm rate,Radar clutter,feature weighting space,nearest neighbour methods,Training,sea-surface small target detection,Clutter,sea-surface target detection method,Object detection,Anomaly detection framework,multiple-feature-based detection methods,training sample set,Radar detection,"
"a novel approach exploiting properties of convolutional neural networks for vessel movement anomaly detection and classification","2022","The article concerns the automation of vessel movement anomaly detection for maritime and coastal traffic safety services. Deep Learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), were used to solve this problem. Three variants of the datasets, containing samples of vessel traffic routes in relation to the prohibited area in the form of a grayscale image, were generated. 1458 convolutional neural networks with different structures were trained to find the best structure to classify anomalies. The influence of various parameters of network structures on the overall accuracy of classification was examined. For the best networks, class prediction rates were examined. Activations of selected convolutional layers were studied and visualized to present how the network works in a friendly and understandable way. The best convolutional neural network for detecting vessel movement anomalies has been proposed. The proposed CNN is compared with multiple baseline algorithms trained on the same dataset.","Vessel movement anomalies,Convolutional neutral networks,Radar datasets,Deep learning,Anomaly detection,"

Adaptation is a basic capability under these circumstances. This paper presents a maritime surveillance platform designed to be flexible and robust. It features online configuration capabilities allowing to: (a) change the applied algorithms, (b) modify the operating parameters of the running algorithms, (c) tune the characterization of the available sensors. These configurations can be applied to limited spatial regions and time spans.

"belief modeling for maritime surveillance","2009","In maritime surveillance, the volume of information to be processed is very large and there is a great deal of uncertainty about the data. There are many vessels at sea at every point in time, and the vast majority of them pose no threat to security. Sifting through all of the benign activity to find unusual activities is a difficult problem. The problem is made even more difficult by the fact that the available data about vessel activities is both incomplete and inconsistent. In order to manage this uncertainty, automated anomaly detection software can be very useful in the early detection of threats to security. This paper introduces a high-level architecture for an anomaly detection system based on a formal model of beliefs with respect to each entity in some domain of interest. In this framework, the system has beliefs about the intentions of each vessel in the maritime domain. If the vessel behaves in an unexpected manner, these intentions are revised and a human operations centre worker is notified. This approach is flexible, scalable, and easily manages inconsistent information. Moreover, the approach has the pragmatic advantage that it uses expert information to inform decision making, but the required information is easily obtained through simple ranking exercises.","surveillance,Anomaly detection,automated anomaly detection software,Marine vehicles,Monitoring,security of data,Decision making,Information security,data uncertainty,belief modeling,Application software,marine engineering,maritime surveillance,Humans,Radar tracking,decision making,high-level architecture,belief revision,Uncertainty,Surveillance,Data security,"
"context-enhanced vessel prediction based on ornstein-uhlenbeck processes using historical ais traffic patterns: real-world experimental results","2014","Traffic route analysis and prediction are both essential for maritime security. Specifically, the prediction of a vessel position is useful to provide alerts about upcoming events (e.g., opportunities and threats). However, accurate prediction along a route in the maritime domain is a challenging task, due to the complex and dynamic nature of traffic patterns. This paper presents a vessel prediction method, based on the popular Ornstein-Uhlenbeck stochastic processes, whose parameters are estimated from historical patterns of life. The historical traffic routes are obtained by pre-processing Automatic Identification System (AIS) data via the CMRE tool called Traffic Route Extraction for Anomaly Detection (TREAD). These recurrent routes allow prediction of the position of a vessel that is following one of these routes, surprisingly, by several hours. The method is validated using a case study related to the second data campaign of the EC FP7 Project New Service Capabilities for Integrated and Advanced Maritime Surveillance (NEREIDS)1. We demonstrate that the prediction accuracy is well represented by the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model.","surveillance,New Service Capabilities for Integrated and Advanced Maritime Surveillance,anomaly detection,security of data,Stochastic processes,Predictive models,Transmitters,historical AIS traffic pattern,vessel position prediction uncertainty,context enhanced vessel prediction method,NEREIDS,automatic identification system,CMRE tool,stochastic processes,marine engineering,Target tracking,maritime domain,Radar tracking,Real-time systems,Ornstein-Uhlenbeck stochastic process,traffic route extraction,traffic engineering computing,parameter estimation,Data mining,traffic route analysis,EC FP7 Project,"

"texture anomaly detection in radar imagery","1994","A radar image of the land or sea will contain extended regions of apparently homogeneous textures arising from, for example, forested areas or uniformly driven expanses of water. However, such regions may contain subtle texture anomalies which indicate the presence of a feature of interest such as a change in tree density due to environmental effects, damping of the sea surface due to the presence of pollutants or the presence of land-based or maritime military targets. For this reason, it is of interest to develop methods of detecting anomalies in textured regions. A strategy for texture anomaly detection is to estimate the multi-variate probability density function (PDF) of a texture segment using the whole homogeneous region as training data and then to calculate the likelihood of occurrence of each individual segment within the region given the PDF estimate. Those texture segments with anomalous likelihood values can then be flagged as potential texture anomalies.<>","Image texture analysis,radar imagery,PDF estimate,image texture,texture segment,Statistics,statistical analysis,texture anomaly detection,multi-variate probability density,Radar,radar image,texture segments,radar,"
"statistical maneuver net generation for anomaly detection in navigational waterways","2019","Maritime Observation Systems (AIS, radar, ...) generating a lot of data, which have a great potential to gain new insights and a better understanding of the maritime traffic. Identifying anomalies (e.g. unplanned maneuvers) for test case generation is an important topic in the development process of highly automated systems. For anomaly detection it is necessary to identify common behavior, to separate normal from anomal maneuvering in navigational waterways. By observing vessel tracks, the behavior can be derived from the driven maneuvers of a vessel. Extracting maneuvers out of historical observation data (e.g. AIS) is an important task.

"spatio-temporal data mining for maritime situational awareness","2015","Maritime Situational Awareness (MSA) is the capability of understanding events, circumstances and activities within and impacting the maritime environment. Nowadays, the vessel positioning sensors provide a vast amount of data that could enhance the maritime knowledge if analysed and modelled. Vessel positioning data is dynamic and continuous on time and space, requiring spatio-temporal data mining techniques to derive knowledge. In this paper, several spatio-temporal data mining techniques are proposed to enhance the MSA, tackling existing challenges such as automatic maritime route extraction and synthetic representation, mapping vessels activities, anomaly detection or position and track prediction. The aim is to provide a more complete and interactive Maritime Situational Picture (MSP) and, hence, to provide more capabilities to operational authorities and policy-makers to support the decision-making process.

"ais-based maritime anomaly traffic detection: a review","2023","Maritime transportation plays an essential role in global trade. Due to the huge number of vessels worldwide, there is also a non-negligible volume of Maritime incidents such as collisions/sinking and illegal events (e.g., piracy, smuggling, and unauthorized fishing). Electronic equipment/systems, such as radars and Automatic Identification Systems (AIS), have contributed to improving maritime situational awareness. AIS provides one of the fundamental sources of vessel kinematics and static data. Today, many approaches are focused on automatically detecting the vessels’ traffic behavior and discovering useful patterns and deviations from those data. These studies contribute to detecting suspicious activities and anomalous trajectories, whose developed techniques could be applied in the surveillance systems, helping the authorities to anticipate proper actions. Several concerns and difficulties are involved in the analyses of vessel kinematics data: how to deal with big data generated, inconsistencies, irregular updates, dynamic data, unlabeled data, and evaluation.

"malicious ais spoofing and abnormal stealth deviations: a comprehensive statistical framework for maritime anomaly detection","2021","The automatic identification system (AIS) is an essential and economical equipment for collision avoidance and maritime surveillance. However, AIS can be subject to intentional reporting of false information, or â€œspoofingâ€. This article assumes the vessel trajectory nominally follows a piecewise mean-reverting process; thereby, it addresses the problem of establishing whether a vessel is reporting adulterated position information through AIS messages in order to hide its current planned route and a possible deviation from the nominal route. Multiple hypothesis testing suggests a framework to enlist reliable information from monitoring systems (coastal radars and space-born satellite sensors) in support of detection of anomalies, spoofing, and stealth deviations. The proposed solution involves the derivation of anomaly detection rules based on the generalized likelihood ratio test and the model-order selection methodologies.

"airborne maritime surveillance using magnetic anomaly detection signature","2020","For an airborne sensor, there is a pressing need to be able to detect/track submerged submarines, shipwrecks, sea mines, unexploded explosive ordnance, and buried drums during maritime surveillance. Traditional usage is the magnetic anomaly detection (MAD), where the small changes in the earth's magnetic field caused by the ferrous components of the targets are measured. The primary means of long-range detection and classification of targets are with passive and active acoustic sensors, and MAD is used for accurate final localization. MAD could also be used for land-based targets but this is not common. Knowing the relationship between the magnetic signature and the kinematic parameters, the tracking problem can be formulated under a Bayesian framework. In this article, multiple nonlinear filters are used for a real single surface-target tracking problem in maritime surveillance using an airborne total-field sensor. The posterior CramÃ©r-Rao lower bound for MAD is derived. Given the total-field measurements, these filters can estimate the kinematic states as well as the permanent moments and induced moments effectively.

"coastal sar and plrm altimetry in german bight and west baltic sea","2018","Unlike previous altimetric missions, the CryoSat-2 altimeter features a novel Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) mode that allows higher resolution and more accurate altimeter-derived parameters in the coastal zone, thanks to the reduced along-track footprint. The scope of this study is to quantify regionally the skills of CryoSat-2 SAR altimetry for distances to coast smaller than 10 km, during the mission lifetime and at different time scales. The validated geophysical altimeter parameters are the sea surface height above the ellipsoid, the significant sea wave height and wind speed, all computed at 20 Hz. These have been compared to in situ and regional model data along the coasts of German Bight and West Baltic Sea during a time interval of almost six years, from July 2010 to March 2016, to investigate both instantaneous and seasonal behaviour. From CryoSat-2 FBR (Full Bit Rate) data, a Delay-Doppler processing and waveform retracking tailored specifically to the coastal zone has been carried out, by applying a Hamming window and zero-padding, using an extended vertical swath window in order to mitigate tracker errors. Moreover, a dedicated SAMOSA-based coastal retracker (here referred to as SAMOSA+) has also been implemented. Since one of the highest remaining uncertainties in the altimeter parameters estimated in coastal shallow waters arises from residual errors in the applied range and geophysical corrections, innovative and high resolution solutions for ocean tide model, geoid, mean sea surface and wet tropospheric correction have been selected. As CryoSat-2 SAR and LRM (Low Rate Mode) modes are not collocated in time, in order to quantify the improvement in the coastal zone with respect to pulse-limited altimetry, 20 Hz PLRM (pseudo-LRM) data from CryoSat-2 FBR were built and retracked, adopting the ALES adaptive sub-waveform approach, with a numerical Brown-based retracker, here referred to as TALES. The cross-validation proves the good consistency between PLRM and SAR sea level anomaly in the coastal zone. The regional ocean model (BSH) shows the highest agreement with the SAR sea level anomaly, with a standard deviation of the differences (stdd) of 24 cm, whereas the corresponding value with respect to PLRM is 55 cm. Distance to coast plots show that land contamination begins to affect sea level and wave measurements at 2 km from the coast in SAR and at 3.5 km in PLRM TALES. The analysis of monthly mean time-series shows that SAR Altimetry is able to measure the sea level monthly mean in the coastal zone of the region of interest, during the entire mission, more precisely than PLRM. The cross-validation against in situ data also proves the higher accuracy of SAR SAMOSA+ compared to PLRM TALES in the coastal zone, with average SLA stdd of 4.4 cm and 8.4 cm respectively.","Sea level,SAR altimetry,CryoSat-2,Coastal altimetry,Retracking,In situ validation,"

This is done by the pre-extraction of contextual information as the baseline patterns of life (i.e., routes) in the area under investigation. In addition to a brief description of the approach to derive the routes, their characterization and representation is presented in support of exploitable knowledge to classify anomalies. A hierarchical reasoning is proposed where new tracks are first associated to existing routes based on their positional information only and â€œoff-routeâ€ vesselsâ€ are detected. Then, for on-route vessels further anomalies are detected such as â€œspeed anomalyâ€ or â€œheading anomalyâ€.

"grid size optimization for potential field based maritime anomaly detection","2014","This study focuses on improving the potential field based maritime data modeling method, developed to extract traffic patterns and detect anomalies, in a clear, understandable and informative way. The method's novelty lies in employing the concept of a potential field for AIS vessel tracking data abstraction and maritime traffic representation. Unlike the traditional maritime surveillance equipment, such as radar or GPS, the AIS system comprehensively represents the identity and properties of a vessel, as well as its behavior, thus preserving the effects of navigational decisions, based on the skills of experienced seamen. In the developed data modeling process, every vessel generates potential charges, which value represent the vessel's behavior, and drops the charges at locations it passes. Each AIS report is used to assign a potential charge at the reported vessel positions. The method derives three construction elements, which define, firstly, how charges are accumulated, secondly, how a charge decays over time, and thirdly, in what way the potential is distributed around the source charge. The collection of potential fields represents a model of normal behavior, and vessels not conforming to it are marked as anomalous. In the anomaly detection prototype system STRAND, the sensitivity of anomaly detection can be modified by setting a geographical coordinate grid precision to more dense or coarse. The objective of this study is to identify the optimal grid size for two different conditions – an open sea and a port area case. A noticeable shift can be observed between the results for the open sea and the port area. The plotted detection rates converge towards an optimal ratio for smaller grid sizes in the port area (60-200 meters), than in the open sea case (300-1000 meters). The effective outcome of the potential filed based anomaly detection is filtering out all vessels behaving normally and presenting a set of anomalies, for a subsequent incident analysis using STRAND as an information visualization tool.","maritime traffic,potential field,anomaly detection,AIS,"

"deep learning to enhance maritime situation awareness","2019","Maritime surveillance sensors like AIS (Automatic Identification System) and Radar provide useful information for decision-making support, which is of paramount importance for effective operations against maritime threats and illegal activities [1]. However, decision-making systems that trust solely on AIS information tend to fail in real situations because such information could be missing, inaccurate or even deceptive [2]. On the other hand, only Radar information is not enough to get a complete description of the maritime situational picture. This paper proposes a deep learning framework for vessel monitoring that examines a particular scenario where a deep learning solution can infer a navigation status based on the vessels trajectories, and thus to detect suspicious vessels activities. For this purpose, a dataset, named DeepMarine, has been specifically created by collecting data of AIS historical recordings.

"improving sar wind retrieval through automatic anomalous pixel detection","2023","Satellite observations are increasingly in demand and valuable for monitoring the ocean and coastal winds in near-real-time and analyzing the data historically. However, soared up human activities, man-made constructions, and marine traffics negatively interfere and affect the reliability of observations and raise concerns about the trustworthiness of using satellite winds for many applications, such as offshore wind energy, even though Sentinel synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data is freely and easily accessible. In this paper, we presented a novel methodological framework for localization and suppression of anomalous pixels (APs), which deteriorate the confidence and accuracy of the retrieved SAR wind speeds. The backbone of the implementation relied on the constant false alarm rate (CFAR) algorithm, one of the automatic target recognition algorithms. We used a large dataset of SAR subscenes to model different sea clutter conditions after removing the potential targets. We selected the suitable distribution model that maintains a constant probability of false alarm (pfa) for the entire SAR scene. The proper pfa was optimized in various SAR scenes ranging from scenes with a considerable number of APs, such as ships and wind park clusters, to scenes with no visible APs under different wind speed conditions. The pfa optimization process prevented real wind pixels from being misidentified as APs. Applying CFAR to the logarithmic scale of raw digital numbers (log-DNs) domain with a pfa of about 3.17 × 10-5, we extracted SAR wind speeds around each ocean buoy before and after CFAR process, comparing them with their corresponding in situ wind measurements. This led to significant improvement in the quality and accuracy of SAR wind data retrieval, especially in regions with numerous man-made constructions and high marine traffics. We tested and validated our approach in the North Sea and two regions along the eastern coast of the U.S. The enclosed region, serving as a marine route for harbors in Delaware Bay, showed a substantial improvement in RMSE and BIAS after applying our approach, reducing RMSE from 2.4 m/s to 1.6 m/s and the BIAS from −1.5 m/s to −0.3 m/s. The open ocean region demonstrated stable RMSE and BIAS, indicating preservation of real wind data, as only APs affecting SAR wind speed were considered during the process.","Offshore wind farm,SAR,Sentinel-1,CFAR,Anomalous pixel,Coastal environment,"

The requirement to detect anomalous behaviour at open sea can be fulfilled for ships with sizes >; 30 meter if appropriate context information is available. Displacement of not too small vessels and preparatory activities for illegal trafficking can often be detected in high resolution imagery. However, details and detection of replacements of these objects cannot be obtained.","Satellites,surveillance,Zeebrugge harbour,wide swath SAR imagery,Rotterdam harbour,spaceborne SAR,Marine vehicles,SAR,Synthetic aperture radar,Change Detection,geophysical image processing,high resolution imagery,high resolution SAR data,illegal trafficking,Military Requirements,English Channel area,change detection,object detection,synthetic aperture radar,search radar,Europe,oceanographic regions,Maritime Situation Awareness,Image resolution,military requirements,open sea,maritime situation awareness,spaceborne radar,Surveillance,Security,security requirements,context information,"

"detecting anomalous deviations from standard maritime routes using the ornsteinâ€“uhlenbeck process","2018","A novel anomaly detection procedure based on the Ornsteinâ€“Uhlenbeck (OU) mean-reverting stochastic process is presented. The considered anomaly is a vessel that deviates from a planned route, changing its nominal velocity $\boldsymbol{v}_0$. In order to hide this behavior, the vessel switches off its automatic identification system (AIS) device for a time  $T$ and then tries to revert to the previous nominal velocity $\boldsymbol{v}_0$. The decision that has to be made is declaring that a deviation either happened or not, relying only upon two consecutive AIS contacts. Furthermore, the extension to the scenario in which multiple contacts (e.g., radar) are available during the time period $T$ is also considered. A proper statistical hypothesis testing procedure that builds on the changes in the OU process long-term velocity parameter $\boldsymbol{v}_0$ of the vessel is the core of the proposed approach and enables the solution of the anomaly detection problem. Closed analytical forms are provided for the detection and false alarm probabilities of the hypothesis test.","real-world data,AIS contacts,Anomaly detection,anomaly detection problem,Marine vehicles,mean-reverting stochastic process,statistical hypothesis testing,target tracking,Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process,automatic identification system,marine engineering,stochastic processes,statistical testing,radar,long term prediction of vessel motion,standard maritime routes,Ornsteinâ€“Uhlenbeck process,Artificial intelligence,maritime anomaly detection,Maritime surveillance,statistical hypothesis test,Trajectory,probability,anomalous deviation detection,Transponders,marine communication,anomaly detection procedure,Spaceborne radar,"
"self-learning adaptive algorithm for maritime traffic abnormal movement detection based on virtual pheromone method","2015","The paper deals with a newly designed self-learning adaptive algorithm enabling detecting any non-standard movement in marine traffic based on the bio-inspired virtual pheromone method. The algorithm detects non-standard vessel movements purely based on the common marine traffic patterns from the Automated Identification System. The proposed approach provides rapid self-learning and fast adaptation characteristics. We verified the algorithm's accuracy in two modes, each of which incorporates different learning factors.

"comparison of target detectors to identify icebergs in quad- polarimetric sar alos-2 images","2021","Icebergs represent hazards to ships and maritime activities and therefore their detection is essential. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellites are very useful for this, due to their capability to acquire under cloud cover and during polar nights. Additionally, polarimetry has been proven to improve the detection capability. In this work, we compare six state-of-the-art quad polarimetric detectors to test their performance and ability to detect small sized icebergs in four locations in Greenland. These were the polarimetric notch filter (PNF), polarimetric match filter (PMF), polarimetric whitening filter (PWF), optimal polarimetric detector (OPD), reflection symmetry detector, and the dual polarisation anomaly detector (iDPolRAD). We use four single look complex ALOS-2 quad pol images. The data were calibrated and processed. We produce the covariance matrices of each image before applying a testing and training window for detection. We also add a guard window to reduce false alarms. Our results show that the multi-look polarimetric whitening filter and optimal polarimetric detector provide the most optimal performance in quad and dual pol mode detection.","Satellites,sized icebergs,covariance matrices,Synthetic Aperture Radar satellites,multilook polarimetric whitening filter,Marine vehicles,Polarimetry,SAR,geophysical image processing,detection capability,ships,Reflection,matched filters,Oceans,object detection,reflection symmetry detector,synthetic aperture radar,target detectors,Iceberg,radar imaging,identify icebergs,Training,Target Detection,Matched filters,polarimetry,optimal polarimetric detector,dual pol mode detection,radar polarimetry,single look complex ALOS-2 quad pol images,dual polarisation anomaly detector,quad- polarimetric sar alos-2,state-of-the-art quad polarimetric detectors,notch filters,remote sensing by radar,Detectors,Detection,"

"random finite set tracking for anomaly detection in the presence of clutter","2020","In this paper, a sequential Bayesian framework is proposed to address the task of joint anomaly detection and tracking for surveillance applications in the presence of clutter. This is achieved by modeling the anomaly as a switching unknown control input which goes into action by modifying the expected dynamics of a target and ceases its activity (becomes nonexistent) under nominal behavior. Random Finite Sets (RFS) make it possible to represent the switching nature of the object anomalous behavior and derive a hybrid Bernoulli filter (HBF) that sequentially updates the joint posterior density of a Bernoulli RFS for the unknown velocity input and the object kinematic state. In addition, the proposed HBF has been customized for maritime anomaly detection by using a piecewise Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) stochastic process as dynamic model of vessels. We illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed filter, implemented in Gaussian-mixture form, and compare its performance in a maritime surveillance example with the Interacting Multiple Model Probabilistic Data Association Filter (IMM - PDAF) for different levels of clutter.","surveillance,sensor fusion,Anomaly detection,Bayes methods,Mathematical model,Switches,switching nature,switching unknown control input,Interacting Multiple Model Probabilistic Data Association Filter,Radio frequency,target tracking,unknown velocity input,sequential Bayesian framework,object tracking,Random Finite Sets,nominal behavior,surveillance applications,filtering theory,hybrid Bernoulli filter,Gaussian processes,Bernoulli RFS,Radar tracking,maritime anomaly detection,random Finite set tracking,clutter,joint anomaly detection,HBF,probability,Clutter,joint posterior density,object anomalous behavior,object kinematic state,Gaussian-mixture form,piecewise Ornstein-Uhlenbeck stochastic process,maritime surveillance example,"

"from unsupervised to semi-supervised anomaly detection methods for hrrp targets","2020","Responding to the challenge of detecting unusual radar targets in a well identified environment, innovative anomaly and novelty detection methods keep emerging in the literature. This work aims at presenting a benchmark gathering common and recently introduced unsupervised anomaly detection (AD) methods, the results being generated using high-resolution range profiles. A semi-supervised AD (SAD) is considered to demonstrate the added value of having a few labeled anomalies to improve performances. Experiments were conducted with and without pollution of the training set with anomalous samples in order to be as close as possible to real operational contexts. The common AD methods composing our baseline will be One-Class Support Vector Machines (OC-SVM), Isolation Forest (IF), Local Outlier Factor (LOF) and a Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE). The more innovative AD methods put forward by this work are Deep Support Vector Data Description (Deep SVDD) and Random Projection Depth (RPD), belonging respectively to deep and shallow AD. The semi-supervised adaptation of Deep SVDD constitutes our SAD method. HRRP data was generated by a coastal surveillance radar, our results thus suggest that AD can contribute to enhance maritime and coastal situation awareness.","semisupervised anomaly detection methods,Pollution,unusual radar targets,benchmark gathering,Support vector machines,Anomaly detection,radar detection,HRRP targets,anomaly detection,unsupervised learning,high-resolution range profiles,Neural networks,semisupervised adaptation,novelty detection methods,radar target detection,radar computing,innovative anomaly,support vector machines,SAD method,machine learning,object detection,radar target recognition,innovative AD methods,search radar,identified environment,Deep SVDD,high-resolution range profile,Radar,common AD methods,convolutional neural nets,labeled anomalies,Training,One-Class Support Vector Machines,neural network,semisupervised AD,Radar detection,"

"bayesian filtering for dynamic anomaly detection and tracking","2022","This article presents a Bayesian approach for sequential detection of anomalies in the motion of a target and joint tracking. The anomaly is modeled as a binary (on/off) switching unknown control input that goes into action (begins to exist, or â€œswitches onâ€) thereby modifying the object dynamics; and by ceasing its activity (becoming nonexistent, or â€œswitching offâ€) returns the dynamics to nominal. The developed Bayesian framework brings together random finite set (RFS) theory to represent the switching nature of the anomaly, and optimal joint input and state estimation to sequentially update a hybrid state that incorporates a random vector for the kinematic state and a Bernoulli RFS for the unknown control input. In addition, a closed-form solution, the Gaussian-mixture hybrid Bernoulli filter (GM-HBF), has been developed to provide a customized solution for dynamic anomaly detection in the maritime domain characterized by linear Gaussian target dynamics. Based on the Ornsteinâ€“Uhlenbeck dynamic model for vessels, where the evolution of the object velocity is governed by a piecewise mean-reverting stochastic process, the anomaly can be represented by a change in the long-run mean velocity (i.e., the unknown control input) from the nominal condition that forces the vessel to deviate from its standard route. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed GM-HBF in both simulated and real-world maritime surveillance applications and test its performance in the face of false measurements, detection uncertainty, and sensor data gaps.","developed Bayesian framework,surveillance,kinematic state,Mathematical models,Anomaly detection,Automatic identification system (AIS),Bayesian approach,random finite sets (RFSs),Bayesian filtering,Bayes methods,object dynamics,linear Gaussian target dynamics,Switches,Bernoulli filter,switching unknown control input,Radio frequency,target tracking,Aerodynamics,stochastic processes,filtering theory,radar,state estimation,detection uncertainty,Gaussian processes,Bernoulli RFS,Radar tracking,maritime anomaly detection,dynamic anomaly detection,joint input and state estimation (JISE),probability,Ornstein-Uhlenbeck dynamic model,GM-HBF,Gaussian-mixture hybrid Bernoulli filter,"
