"online detection of anomaly behaviors based on multidimensional trajectories","2020","In the surveillance domain, timely detection of anomaly behaviors is very important and is a great challenge to human operators due to information overload, fatigue and inattention. Many anomaly detection algorithms based on trajectories have been proposed for this problem. However, these algorithms generally have problems such as complex parameter setting, unfaithful statistical model, not well-calibrated false alarm rate, poor ability of online learning and sequential anomaly detection, etc. The theory of conformal prediction was introduced to solve these problems by constructing the sequential Hausdorff nearest neighbor conformal anomaly detector. Yet, it only considers position information of the targets and is not sensitive to velocity and course anomaly behaviors. And the run times are increasing as the increase of the data size, which is not appropriate for early warning surveillance application. In order to solve these problems, sequential multi-factor Hausdorff nearest neighbor conformal anomaly detector (SMFHNNCAD) and sequential multi-factor Hausdorff nearest neighbor inductive conformal anomaly detector (SMFHNNICAD) based on multidimensional trajectories are proposed in this paper. Experiments in both simulated military scenario and realistic civilian scenario show the presented algorithm has a good performance to online detect anomaly behaviors and would have a wide prospect in early warning surveillance systems.","Multidimensional,Anomaly behavior,Trajectory,Online detection,"
"motion modeling and simulation of maritime autonomous surface ships in realistic environmental disturbances","2020","A novel modeling and simulation pipeline is proposed in this paper to predict the six-degrees-of-freedom (6-DOF) motion of MASS under realistic environmental disturbances. The MASS model consists of several physics-based differential equations that are built based on state-of-the-art studies. The onboard sensors are utilized to drive the MASS model to keep the consistent control input with the real ships. A build-in hydrodynamic database describes the motion characteristics of ships. Moreover, an actual sea database is developed based on the third-generation wave numerical model to reproduce the ocean characteristics in the simulation. The spatial-and time-varying environmental vector fields are obtained from the real sea database to ensure consistency with the real environment. Three real voyage cases are reproduced by the presented method. The simulation results are compared with the records from onboard sensors for validation. The RMSE of the simulated trajectories is 3.789', 3.110', and 1.318' under the single influence of disturbances due to the inappropriate description of the real sea. Under the coupling disturbances, the RMSE of trajectories reduces to 0.1829', 0.5249', and 0.4030'. Consequently, the results indicate that the ocean database accurately reflected the ocean characteristics realistically, and the presented method can effectively predict the motions of the real ship under the actual sea environmental disturbances.","onboard sensors,control system synthesis,state-of-the-art studies,third-generation wave numerical model,remotely operated vehicles,maritime autonomous surface ships,Marine vehicles,ship,Mathematical model,coupling disturbances,simulated trajectories,spatial- time-varying environmental vector fields,Predictive models,realistic environmental disturbances,ships,differential equations,hydrodynamic database,hydrodynamics,motion control,Databases,Oceans,position control,ocean database,motion modeling,motion characteristics,actual sea environmental disturbances,physics-based differential equations,Hydrodynamics,Numerical models,time series,six-degrees-of-freedom,actual sea database,mobile robots,MASS model,marine control,numerical analysis,consistent control input,ocean characteristics,"
"conflictfinder: mining maritime traffic conflict from massive ship trajectories","2017","Collision-free is one of the major safety concerns for maritime traffic management. To analyze the collision data and understand the cause of the collision can contribute the improvement of the maritime traffic safety and management. However, the real collisions is not always available to analyze. Based on a massive AIS trajectory data collected, we focus on mining the ships' movement behaviors those may bring a possible collision if they do not take any avoidance, called Maritime Traffic Conflict. Even though the maritime traffic conflict is a non-accident incident, the movement behaviors of maritime traffic conflict may have the similar behaviors of navigational collision for analysis. Thus, we propose ConflictFinder to provide a framework for maritime traffic conflict mining. Different from existing methods those focus on detecting the conflicts between two ships in a restricted water way, we discover the conflicts occurred by multi-ships in open sea. For analysis of maritime traffic conflicts, a prototype of ConflictFinder is implemented which helps with gaining a better understanding of traffic conflicts discovered and can be applied to the improvement of maritime traffic safety evaluation and management.","AIS Data,data mining,maritime traffic conflict,Safety,Marine vehicles,mining maritime traffic,massive AIS trajectory data,Trajectory Data Mining,massive ship trajectories,ships,collision data analysis,marine safety,maritime traffic safety evaluation,marine engineering,ship movement behaviors,maritime traffic safety management,Prototypes,Artificial intelligence,ConflictFinder,Conflict Detection,Maritime Traffic,Trajectory,navigational collision,restricted water way,open sea,maritime traffic safety,Navigation,Data mining,collision free,"
"research on ship abnormal behavior detection method based on graph neural network","2022","Because of the existing maritime intelligent supervision, ship abnormal behavior detection ignores the interdependence between different time series of ships and different abnormal behavior characteristics, which leads to poor real-time performance and limited detection accuracy of abnormal detection.

This mechanism uses a sliding window to generate fixed data input, uses graph attention network to capture the dependence between ship behavior characteristics, and determines the threshold of anomaly according to the sea environment set in this paper.

"vessel sailing route extraction and analysis from satellite-based ais data using density clustering and probability algorithms","2023","The vessel Automatic Identification System (AIS) data collected by satellites have the features of large coverage area and large data volume, and they are instantaneous discrete data rather than time-continuous data, so the data has large dispersion with many noise points. This poses a challenge for vessel sailing route extraction. This paper proposes a vessel sailing route extraction method which consists of the fast Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm and the Kernel Density Estimation-based Outlier Factor (KDE-based OF) noise reduction algorithm. The method in this paper firstly improves the clustering discrimination method in the DBSCAN algorithm to separate trajectories in different directions. Secondly, this paper extracts a fast clustering algorithm based on the density clustering algorithm to reduce its computing time overhead with satellite big data. Finally, this paper proposes the KDE-based OF processing algorithm, which calculates the outlier probability distribution value of the trajectory points through the algorithm to eliminate the edge trajectory points with low probability distribution. Based on the actual satellite vessel AIS data, this paper conducts multi-method comparisons and performance analysis experiments.

"a novel model for ship trajectory anomaly detection based on gaussian mixture variational autoencoder","2023","The use of traditional methods in anomaly detection of multi-class ship trajectories showed some limitations in terms of robustness and learning ability of trajectory features. In view of this, an anomaly detection model for ship trajectory data based on Gaussian Mixture Variational Autoencoder (GMVAE) is proposed in this study using an unsupervised classification method. The proposed model modifies Variational Autoencoder (VAE) by changing the inferential distribution of prior distribution and approximate posterior to the Gaussian mixture model. A high-dimensional hidden space is constructed to learn the features of multi-class trajectory data, and the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) method is applied to measure the error between the reconstructed trajectory and the original trajectory in order to judge whether the ship trajectory is abnormal. The Automatic Identification System (AIS) data from the US coastal areas are used to verify the proposed model, and the results are compared with other commonly used models in a manually labeled dataset. The research results indicate that the detection rate of the proposed model is 91.26%, and the false alarm rate is 0.68%, which performs the best. Using the Gaussian mixture model to describe the distribution of hidden space can improve the learning ability of multi-class trajectories of VAE, thus increasing the robustness of the model. This research can provide technical support for ship trajectory data analysis and risk management of maritime transportation.","Trajectory,anomaly detection of ship trajectory,Clustering algorithms,Classification algorithms,Mathematical models,gaussian mixture variational autoencoder (gmvae),unsupervised learning,Gaussian distribution,Marine vehicles,Artificial neural networks,intelligent transportation,AIS,"

"characterization of an episode with elevated ozone concentrations","1976","A detailed analysis has been made of a seven day period in 1973, during which elevated ozone levels were observed at Ottawa. In addition to the ozone data, results are also presented for oxides of nitrogen, carbon monoxide, methane, total hydrocarbons and particulate matter. The particulates were analyzed for seven constituents, including the cations ammonium, calcium, sodium, potassium and lead and the anions sulfate and nitrate. Also measured were several other properties of the particulates, including the size distribution. It was found that none of the other gaseous pollutants showed any increase in concentration when high ozone levels were present. In contrast, the particulate matter did increase and several constituents, notably ammonium and sulfate, showed a dramatic rise. A comparison with ozone data from Toronto and upper New York state showed that the high ozone concentrations were widespread. A meteorological analysis showed that elevated ozone levels were associated with a Tropical air mass with a moderate southwesterly flow of air. Trajectory calculations were carried out to show the origin of the air over Ottawa before, during and after the period of increased ozone.",""
"a multi-task analysis and modelling paradigm using lstm for multi-source monitoring data of inland vessels","2020","The vessel monitoring data provide important information for people to understand the vessel dynamic status in real time and make appropriate decisions in vessel management and operations. However, some of the essential data may be incomplete or unavailable. In order to recover or predict the missing information and best exploit the vessels monitoring data, this paper combines statistical analysis, data mining and neural network methods to propose a multi-task analysis and modelling framework for multi-source monitoring data of inland vessels. Specifically, an advanced neural network, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) was tailored and employed to tackle three important tasks, including vessel trajectory repair, engine speed modelling and fuel consumption prediction. The developed models have been validated using the real-life vessel monitoring data and shown to outperform some other widely used modelling methods.

"fast and parameter-light rare behavior detection in maritime trajectories","2020","Rare behaviors indicate important events and situations in maritime surveillance applications. State-of-the-art methods provide many effective solutions to detect anomalous behaviors. Meanwhile, most solutions are parameter-laden and too costly to identify useful rare behaviors with human knowledge in a visual analytics manner. This paper is concerned with a scheme cross trajectories, vessel attributes and the movement context for detecting rare behaviors through preprocessing, kNN-based clustering, and verification. Although the scheme involves several parameters, we demonstrate that they are able to be tackled in thresholds. As a result, a rare behavior factor is the single parameter that affect the detecting results. The proposed scheme is evaluated via a simulated data set for performance and a real life AIS data for effectiveness. Results show that high accuracy to labelled anomalies and useful rare behaviors can be achieved.","Rare behaviour detection,Trajectory,Visual analytics,"

"augmented ship tracking under occlusion conditions from maritime surveillance videos","2020","Ship tracking provides crucial on-site microscopic kinematic traffic information which benefits maritime traffic flow analysis, ship safety enhancement, traffic control, etc., and thus has attracted considerable research attentions in the maritime surveillance community. Conventional ship tracking methods yield satisfied results by exploring distinct visual ship features in maritime images, which may fail when the target ship is partially or fully sheltered by obstacles (e.g., ships, waves, etc.) in maritime videos. To overcome the difficulty, we propose an augmented ship tracking framework via the kernelized correlation filter (KCF) and curve fitting algorithm. First, the KCF model is introduced to track ships in the consecutive maritime images and obtain raw ship trajectory dataset. Second, the data anomaly detection and rectification procedure are implemented to rectify the contaminated ship positions. For the purpose of performance evaluation, we implement the proposed framework and another three popular ship tracking models on the four typical ship occlusion videos. The experimental results show that our proposed framework successfully tracks ships in maritime video clips with high accuracy (i.e., the average root mean square error (RMSE), root mean square percentage error (RMSPE), mean absolute deviation (MAD) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) are less than 10), which significantly outperforms the other popular ship trackers.","Smart ship,maritime surveillance videos,Marine vehicles,Feature extraction,maritime traffic flow analysis,augmented ship tracking,ship trajectory dataset,on-site microscopic kinematic traffic information,visual ship features,Videos,kernelized correlation filter,object tracking,ships,marine safety,marine engineering,Target tracking,object detection,feature extraction,maritime images,Correlation,curve fitting algorithm,image filtering,video signal processing,Training,curve fitting,ship occlusion videos,data anomaly detection,Visualization,traffic control,ship occlusion,traffic engineering computing,ship safety enhancement,video surveillance,visual ship tracking,"
"graph-based ship traffic partitioning for intelligent maritime surveillance in complex port waters","2023","Maritime Situational Awareness (MSA) is a critical component of intelligent maritime traffic surveillance. However, it becomes increasingly challenging to gain MSA accurately given the growing complexity of ship traffic patterns due to multi-ship interactions possibly involving classical manned ships and emerging autonomous ships. This study proposes a new traffic partitioning methodology to realise the optimal maritime traffic partition in complex waters. The methodology combines conflict criticality and spatial distance to generate conflict-connected and spatially compact traffic clusters, thereby improving the interpretability of traffic patterns and supporting ship anti-collision risk management. First, a composite similarity measure is designed using a probabilistic conflict detection approach and a newly formulated maritime traffic route network learned through maritime knowledge mining. Then, an extended graph-based clustering framework is used to produce balanced traffic clusters with high intra-connections but low inter-connections. The proposed methodology is thoroughly demonstrated and tested using Automatic Identification System (AIS) trajectory data in the Ningbo-Zhoushan Port. The experimental results show that the proposed methodology 1) has effective performance in decomposing the traffic complexity, 2) can assist in identifying high-risk/density traffic clusters, and 3) is sufficiently generic to handle various traffic scenarios in complex geographical waters. Therefore, this study makes significant contributions to intelligent maritime surveillance and provides a theoretical foundation for promoting maritime anti-collision risk management for the future mixed traffic of both manned and autonomous ships.","Graph partitioning,Intelligent maritime surveillance,Maritime safety,Maritime knowledge extraction,AIS data,"
"atmospheric river linked to extreme rainfall events over kerala in august 2018","2021","A multi-day atmospheric river (AR) in the second week of August 2018 was pivotal in causing extreme precipitation over south-west coast of India that eventually lead to record-breaking floods in the state of Kerala. Integrated water vapor transport (IVT) analysis depicted an intense and long-duration CAT 5 atmospheric river stretching from the Arabian Sea across South India into the Bay of Bengal. A high-pressure ridge over the eastern Arabian Sea and western India and a trough over the Bay of Bengal forming a subsection of monsoon wave-train was observed ahead of the flood event. The monsoon trough was exacerbated by the synchronous effect of a polar westerly jet trough that created an anomalous low-pressure region covering central and eastern India and a quasi-stationary depression over the Bay of Bengal. The system favored continuous supply of moisture from the Indian Ocean into Kerala. To locate major sources of moisture, the air parcels that rained out to generate extreme precipitation are tracked backwards using the Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory model (HYSPLIT). The backward trajectory analyses reveal that on 13th August more than 60% of the moisture was contributed from the Central-Eastern Indian Ocean, with some intermittent contributions from the Arabian Sea; while on 14th–16th August, about 25–30% was contributed from the Arabian Sea",""

"change in forest condition: characterizing non-stand replacing disturbances using time series satellite imagery","2020","Objective information is required to monitor and characterize disturbances and disturbance regimes as related to changing climate and anthropogenic pressures. Forest disturbances occur over a range of spatial and temporal scales, with varying extent, severity, and persistence. To date, most of our understanding of detecting forest disturbances using remotely sensed imagery has been based on detecting abrupt and rapid, stand replacing disturbances, such as those related to wildfire and forest harvesting. Conversely, more continuous, subtle, and gradual non-stand replacing (NSR) disturbances, such as those related to drought stress or insect infestation have been subject to less focus. This can be attributed to the variability of NSR in space and time, as well as detection difficulties due to their often-subtle alterations to forest canopies and structure. Time series remote sensing techniques offer new opportunities for the capture and characterization of NSR disturbances. In this research, we investigate NSR disturbances as detected using a Landsat time series-based disturbance detection algorithm, Composite2Change (C2C) applied to the 650 Mha forested ecosystems of Canada. We first examined three key characteristics of the spectral trajectory of NSR disturbances: pre-disturbance conditions, disturbance severity and disturbance persistence. From these characteristics, we defined seven typical NSR patterns (exemplars) for Canada’s forested ecosystems. Using annual information on predicted stand-level cover and biomass, we found that all NSR exemplars resulted in a loss of canopy cover, ranging from an average loss of between 5 and 31%. For instance, the most common exemplar was linked to a 15% reduction in canopy cover and a 13 Mg/ha reduction in biomass. While stands lost biomass, over the duration of the NSR, most stands increased slightly in stand height likely due to growth of the remaining trees or release from competition from the remaining stems. Comparing exemplars across Canada with independent data on NSR disturbance events confirmed that NSR exemplars that had larger severities, and shorter disturbance persistence times, were more commonly associated with insect infestations (e.g. mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) and spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana)), whereas exemplars with a lower severity, and longer persistence were more commonly associated with drought events. Developing a nomenclature around remote sensing based characteristics of NSR disturbances provides an approach to both map NSR disturbances and better understand their impact on forest attributes, as well as provide tools to assess if these disturbanes are changing over space and time.","Landsat,Time series,Land cover,Disturbance,Insects,drought,Land use,"
"unsupervised maritime traffic pattern extraction from spatio-temporal data","2015","Maritime traffic pattern extraction is a fundamental and crucial factor for maritime surveillance and anomaly detection.

AIS data is a kind of spatio-temporal data that contains information of location data, as well as time stamps. In this way, traffic pattern is described by AIS data. Furthermore, we conduct a simulation experiment that extracts traffic pattern from the AIS data through the unsupervised technique. The proposed framework takes advantage of AIS data, which is a type of the spatiotemporal data that consists of vessel motion information, to perform the experiment.

"framework for ship trajectory forecasting based on linear stationary models using automatic identification system","2022","Maritime surveillance is of utmost priority for a nation's security, and hence it's economy. For maritime awareness, coastal surveillance, and maritime activities in the Region of Interest (ROI) should be monitored. One of the ways to keep this in check is to restrain unwanted infiltration. Monitoring unwanted infiltration is feasible through vessel trajectory forecasting and anomaly detection in real time. Most solutions for trajectory predictions are available but require a huge amount of historical data, and high-power computing resources. Here, the requirement is developing a decision support framework consisting of both lite weight approaches for short-term predictions and deep learning-based techniques for long-term forecasting. This paper aims to find the suitability of Linear Stationary Models (LSM) like the Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average Model (ARIMA) for predicting and forecasting the Vessel Trajectory as means of lite weight short-term predictions. For this purpose, the Automatic Identification System (AIS) dataset of the U.S. West Coast is used. The significant effort was for data pre-processing to create a robust dataset for model training. An appropriate model after the model-selection process is used for trajectory forecasting. The model's accuracy is validated using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) performance indices for residual and forecast errors. A window generator model is integrated with the best-fitted ARIMA model for recursive real-time predictions, with varied sizes and visualization. The proposed time-series model provided a very high accuracy as the RMSE value for prediction and 48 hours forecast are 0.023 and 0.017, respectively.","Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average Model,Window Generator,Trajectory Forecast,Time Series Analysis,Automatic Identification System,Maritime Surveillance,"
"routeminer: mining ship routes from a massive maritime trajectories","2014","Mining trajectory data has been attracting significant interest in the last years. By analyzing trajectory data, we are able to discover the movement behavior and location-aware knowledge, and then develop many interesting applications such as movement behavior discovery, location prediction, traffic analysis, and so on. However, trajectory data mining is a challenge task because of the trajectory data is available with uncertainty. Furthermore, discovering the valuable knowledge from maritime trajectory is made even more difficult due to the maritime area is a free moving space. Unlike the vehicles' movements are constrained by road networks, there is no such a sea route for ships to follow in maritime area. A ship's movement may not exactly repeat the same trajectory even the ship has the similar movement behavior with others. In this work, Route Miner system provides a framework of ship route mining for maritime traffic analysis. Given a set of ship trajectories in a maritime area, Route Miner explore the movement behavior from those massive trajectories in a free moving space. Then, ship routes are detected based on those behavioral pattern. Finally, the system generates a set of ships routes to provide operators a better understanding from ship trajectory data.

However a series of misuses of the AIS does exist, and data may lack reliability as some users broadcast errors or intentionally falsify the information sent by the device. In this respect, a methodology to assess the integrity and veracity of AIS messages has been developed, leading to the determination of maritime risks in support to maritime monitoring activities. In this paper, an exemplification is proposed, based on AIS possible integrity issues on kinematic data.","identification technology,maritime traffic,collaborative platforms,Marine vehicles,Monitoring,maritime domain awareness,AIS messages,Reliability,Sea measurements,compulsory collision prevention device,fishing pressure,maritime monitoring activities,ships,automatic identification system,maritime risks,marine safety,Automatic Identification System,data falsification,Artificial intelligence,large worldwide AIS datasets,risk analysis,vessel-born noise,Trajectory,marine communication,air pollution,Navigation,collision avoidance,AIS possible integrity issues,"

"framestep: a framework for annotating semantic trajectories based on episodes","2018","We are witnessing an increasing usage of location data by a variety of applications. Consequently, information systems are required to deal with large datasets containing raw data to build high level abstractions. Semantic Web technologies offer powerful representation tools for pervasive applications. The convergence of location-based services and Semantic Web standards allows an easier interlinking and annotation of trajectories. However, due to the wide range of requirements on modeling mobile object trajectories, it is important to define a high-level data model for representing trajectory episodes and contextual elements with multiple levels of granularity and different options to represent spatial and temporal extents, as well as to express quantitative and qualitative semantic descriptions. In this article, we focus on modeling mobile object trajectories in the context of Semantic Web. First, we introduce a new version of the Semantic Trajectory Episodes (STEP) ontology to represent generic spatiotemporal episodes. Then, we present FrameSTEP as a new framework for annotating semantic trajectories based on episodes. As a result, we combine our ontology, which can represent spatiotemporal phenomena at different levels of granularity, with annotation algorithms, which allow to create instances of our model. The proposed spatial annotation algorithm explores the Linked Open Data cloud and OpenStreetMap tags to find relevant types of spatial features in order to describe the environment where the trajectory took place. Our framework can guide the development of future expert systems in trajectory analysis. It enables reasoning about knowledge gathered from large trajectory data and linked datasets in order to create several intelligent services.","Semantic web,Trajectory modeling,Trajectory annotation,"
"analysis of local observability for feature localization in a maritime environment using an omnidirectional camera","2007","Autonomous operation by a surface vehicle in a maritime setting requires that the surface vehicle detects non-water objects, including shoreline, hazards to navigation, and other moving vessels. In order to assess the utility of an omnidirectional camera for detecting and localizing non- water objects, we rigorously investigate observability of both stationary and moving features. For stationary features, we find that all but a small subset of the features are observable. For moving features, we show that an important class of feature and ASV trajectories are not observable.","Remotely operated vehicles,Kalman filters,remotely operated vehicles,robot vision,Cameras,nonlinear systems,observability,Simultaneous localization and mapping,nonwater object detection,Observability,Vehicle detection,stationary features,omnidirectional camera,nonlinear control systems,local observability analysis,Mobile robots,moving features,Instruments,Hazards,maritime environment,mobile robots,autonomous surface vehicle operation,Object detection,Navigation,ASV kinematics,marine vehicles,robot kinematics,feature localization,"
"contextual verification for false alarm reduction in maritime anomaly detection","2015","Automated vessel anomaly detection is immensely important for preventing and reducing illegal activities (e.g., drug dealing, human trafficking, etc.) and for effective emergency response and rescue in a country's territorial waters. A major limitation of previously proposed vessel anomaly detection techniques is the high rate of false alarms as these methods mainly consider vessel kinematic information which is generally obtained from AIS data. In many cases, an anomalous vessel in terms of kinematic data can be completely normal and legitimate if the 'context' at the location and time (e.g., weather and sea conditions) of the vessel is factored in. In this paper, we propose a novel anomalous vessel detection framework that utilizes such contextual information to reduce false alarms through 'contextual verification'. We evaluate our proposed framework for vessel anomaly detection using massive amount of real-life AIS data sets obtained from U.S. Coast Guard. Though our study and developed prototype is based on the maritime domain the basic idea of using contextual information through 'contextual verification' to filter false alarms can be applied to other domains as well.","Kinematics,AIS Data,emergency management,vessel kinematic information,Contextual Verification,Trajectory Clustering,Anomaly Detection,contextual verification,US coast guard,Meteorology,False Alarm Reduction,illegal activities,marine engineering,automated vessel anomaly detection,false alarms,Big data,contextual information,Context,false alarm reduction,maritime anomaly detection,Real-time systems,emergency response,Tracking,Trajectory,territorial waters,AIS data,"
"historical ais data-driven unsupervised automatic extraction of directional maritime traffic networks","2020","Vessel experience route analysis can provide empirical support for maritime traffic management. Recently, the application of the Automatic Identification System (AIS) provides multi-dimensional data about voyages and vessels. However, traditional route extraction methods do not take into account information such as the vessel traffic pattern and the density distribution in the channel. The experience routes obtained is not accurate enough. This paper proposes an unsupervised method for extracting vessel experience routes from historical AIS data. The method consists of three parts: vessel traffic pattern extraction, channel boundary extraction, channel triangle network construction and hottest route extraction. The method comprehensively considers the spatiotemporal information and density distribution of the vessel trajectories, and constructs a directional maritime traffic network which can effectively convert historical data into information supporting decision-making.","Traffic control,vessel experience route analysis,data mining,Clustering algorithms,Kernel,empirical support,historical data,unsupervised method,Feature extraction,historical AIS data-driven unsupervised automatic extraction,Directional Maritime Traffic Network,maritime traffic management,vessel traffic pattern extraction,information supporting decision-making,channel triangle network construction,multidimensional data,density distribution,automatic identification system,marine safety,marine engineering,Traffic Pattern,channel boundary extraction,pattern clustering,decision making,Artificial intelligence,vessel trajectories,Trajectory,Triangular Network,traffic engineering computing,directional maritime traffic network,Data mining,voyages,vessel experience routes,"

The considered anomaly is a vessel that deviates from a planned route, changing its nominal velocity. In order to hide this behavior, the vessel switches off its Automatic Identification System (AIS) device for a certain time, and then tries to revert to the previous nominal velocity. The decision that has to be taken is either declaring that a deviation happened or not, relying only upon two consecutive AIS contacts. A proper statistical hypothesis testing procedure that builds on the changes in the OU process long-term velocity parameter of the vessel is the core of the proposed approach and enables for the solution of the anomaly detection problem.","real-world data,Anomaly detection,Marine vehicles,mean-reverting stochastic process,security of data,maritime security,Stochastic processes,proper statistical hypothesis testing procedure,target tracking,statistical analysis,Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process,OU process long-term velocity parameter,automatic identification system,automatic identification system device,stochastic processes,marine engineering,AIS,nominal velocity,Artificial intelligence,maritime anomaly detection,vessel switches,Trajectory,statistical hypothesis test,Ornstein-Uhlenbeck,Transponders,planned route,Navigation,"
"self-adaption vessel traffic behaviour recognition algorithm based on multi-attribute trajectory characteristics","2020","Clustering analysis is commonly used for vessel traffic behaviour recognition. The clustering results reflect the characteristics of different vessel traffic behaviours, which can assist authorities in transportation management. However, there are two drawbacks to traditional clustering analysis. First, the similarity measures among different trajectories in a clustering analysis mainly focus on spatial differentiation and frequently do not consider motion features, such as speed and course. Second, the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm, a famous clustering analysis method, is characterized by poor self-adaption, which means that it cannot autonomously determine the best parameters based on different sample sets. These issues limit the efficiency of clustering analysis. To address these problems, a new similarity measure using statistical methods and based on multi-attribute trajectory characteristics is proposed to reflect the similarity among different trajectories. The proposed measure considers the spatial and motion features of trajectories. Furthermore, the Parzen window (a non-parametric estimation method) and the multivariate Gaussian distribution are employed to generate self-adaptive strategies to determine the optimal parameters of the DBSCAN algorithm for a given sample set. Finally, numerical experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed similarity measure and improved DBSCAN algorithm. The clustering analysis results obtained with the proposed method could provide insights towards better monitoring and navigation advice to help improve marine managerial effectiveness and avoid maritime accidents.","Vessel behaviour recognition,Self-adaption,Multi-attribute trajectory characteristics,DBSCAN,"
"energy-efficient trajectory design for uav-aided maritime data collection in wind","2022","Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), especially fixed-wing ones that withstand strong winds, have great potential for oceanic exploration and research. This paper studies a UAV-aided maritime data collection system with a fixed-wing UAV dispatched to collect data from marine buoys. We aim to minimize the UAVâ€™s energy consumption in completing the task by jointly optimizing the communication time scheduling among the buoys and the UAVâ€™s flight trajectory subject to wind effect. The conventional successive convex approximation (SCA) method can provide efficient sub-optimal solutions for collecting small/moderate data volume, whereas the solution heavily relies on trajectory initialization and has not explicitly considered wind effect, while the computational/trajectory complexity both become prohibitive for the task with large data volume. To this end, we propose a new cyclical trajectory design framework with tailored initialization algorithm that can handle arbitrary data volume efficiently, as well as a hybrid offline-online (HO2) design that leverages convex stochastic programming (CSP) offline based on wind statistics, and refines the solution by adapting online to real-time wind velocity. Numerical results show that our optimized trajectory can better adapt to various setups with different target data volume and buoysâ€™ topology as well as various wind speed/direction/variance compared with benchmark schemes. In particular, our proposed HO2 design can effectively adapt to random wind variations with feasible and robust online operation, and proactively exploit the wind for further energy savings in both single-buoy and multi-buoy scenarios.","unmanned aerial vehicles,wind statistics,wind effect,aircraft power systems,successive convex approximation,Energy consumption,SCA,convex programming,energy-efficient trajectory design,control engineering computing,hybrid offline-online design,trajectory complexity,Wireless communication,flight trajectory,data acquisition,single-buoy scenarios,real-time wind velocity,target data volume,communication time scheduling,oceanic exploration,UAV-aided maritime data collection system,Maritime data collection,HO2 design,random wind variations,hybrid offline-online (HO2),trajectory initialization,Wind speed,unmanned aerial vehicle,wind direction,energy savings,marine buoys,convex stochastic programming,Real-time systems,autonomous aerial vehicles,wind speed,wind,trajectory control,Trajectory,energy consumption,cyclical trajectory design,computational complexity,mobile robots,energy conservation,sub-optimal solutions,stochastic programming (SP),aerospace computing,Task analysis,multibuoy scenarios,Data collection,approximation theory,stochastic programming,fixed-wing UAV,CSP,"
"ship collision avoidance behaviour recognition and analysis based on ais data","2022","A novel approach is proposed to automatically identify the ship collision avoidance behaviour from ship trajectories based on an improved Sliding Window Algorithm. The approach has three main stages: (1) determining the ships’ obligations according to the Convention on the International Regulations for Preventing Collision at Sea (COLREGs); (2) assessing the rudder angle according to the true bearing of the target ship; (3) identifying the corresponding ship handling behaviour from the ship trajectory taking into account the Rate of Turn and its derivative based on the Sliding Window Algorithm. Four typical encounter scenarios are studied to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method. The approach is then applied to near collision scenarios identified in the maritime traffic off the continental coast of Portugal, which allowed the characterization of the relative and spatial distributions of the locations at which the ships take evasive manoeuvres. The results show that the approach can be applied to accurately detect the ship collision avoidance behaviour from Automatic Identification System trajectory data, and the characterization of the collision avoidance behaviour can potentially be used by situational awareness systems and as the basis for ship collision avoidance decision-making.","Ship evasive manoeuvring,Near collision scenario,Collision avoidance,Sliding window Algorithm,"
"synthetic trajectory extraction for maritime anomaly detection","2018","In the maritime domain, the main goal for large vessels is to drive as fast and efficiently as possible from one harbour to the next. This results in vessels following quite distinct routes. Deviations from these routes can be seen as indicators for illegal or at least suspicious behaviour. In order to extract these routes, clustering algorithms can be used, that will store the traffic patterns as synthetic trajectories. A vessel can be assigned to a specific route or a deviation from the routes can be detected by evaluating these route models. A challenge in designing the synthetic trajectories lies in the faithful representation, sparsity of data, treatment of outliers and split-up of routes. Here, a novel approach to model the uncertainty of the vessels movements while following a route is introduced: A cluster is now represented by a trajectory consisting of segments. Due to obstacles like shallow waters, a route might split up which will generate sub-segments. Instead of storing all cluster points, the position, speed, and course of the vessels are attached to each segment in form of normal distributions. Using these attributes, the probability of a deviation from the given trajectory can be estimated.","Clustering algorithms,Kernel,vessels movements,Anomaly detection,anomaly detection,traffic patterns,security of data,trajectory representation,ships,clustering algorithms,marine engineering,maritime domain,Heating systems,route models,pattern clustering,Artificial intelligence,maritime anomaly detection,synthetic trajectory extraction,Trajectory,data sparsity,probability,Gaussian distribution,data handling,"

"extraction of maritime road networks from large-scale ais data","2019","Extracting road network information including lane boundaries, lane centerlines, junctions and their relationship from AIS data plays an important role in location based services, urban computing and intelligent transportation systems, etc. However, AIS data are large scale, high noisy, the density and quality are very uneven in different areas, extracting a whole, continuous and smooth maritime road network with rich information from such data is a challenging problem. To address these issues, this paper proposes an adaptive maritime road network extraction approach that can extract both lane boundaries and centerlines for a large sea area from AIS data. Based on a road network definition including nodes, segments and segment curves, the approach designs parallel grid merging and filtering algorithms to determine if a grided area is inside lane or not.

"learning for prediction of maritime collision avoidance behavior from ais network","2021","With the rapid increase in global maritime shipping, there is a great demand for the technology of maritime traffic monitoring to detect inappropriate encountering interaction between ships and prevent ship collision accidents. The Automatic Identification System (AIS) network makes it possible to collect a large volume of maritime traffic data and investigate the collision avoidance behavior of real-world ships. Most collision avoidance systems are based on expert systems and simulations based on the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGs). Those regulations outline the general principles underlying collision avoidance; however, they do not provide specific guidance and fail to account for the complexity of many real-world situations. Furthermore, guidance systems coordinating the movement of a ship must have the capacity to predict the movement behavior of all ships involved in potential encounter situations, and do so as early as possible for anti-collision reaction. Our objective in this study was to model the collision avoidance behaviors of human operators in order to formulate a set of realistic trajectory predictions for encountering near collision scenarios. By machine learning approach, the proposed framework is able to learn a model of interaction movement behavior from collected AIS historical traffic data involving near collision situations and then generate a set of predicted trajectories while ships encountering. The proposed model eliminates the need for a priori information related to environmental conditions and the rules governing encounter situations.

"research on detection mechanism of vessel abnormal behavior based on immune genetic spectral clustering algorithm","2022","Maritime transport accounts for over 90% of global trade, and maritime safety has been confirmed as a vital issue of maritime transport. Accordingly, vessel traffic service system (VTS) is capable of assisting the maritime department to complete real-time supervision of a certain water area and increasing the efficiency of water supervision. However, the VTS system has low effectiveness in vessel anomaly detection and supervision, thus resulting in regulatory blind spot in the VTS system. In this study, a vessel trajectory anomaly detection mechanism is developed using the immune genetic spectral clustering method. Moreover, the contour coefficient of scatter clustering is accurately analyzed, and the clustering center is optimized using the adopted method. On that basis, different abnormal features can be detected, and abnormal detection accuracy can be increased. In this study, the vessel trajectory anomaly detection model is built in accordance with the set sliding window and abnormal threshold parameters of vessel trajectory characteristics. The AIS data of Lianyungang to Qingdao port from March 2021 are selected for experimental analysis. The results suggest that the proposed method outperforms the conventional method in the detection accuracy and the false alarm rate, it facilitates the intelligent and automatic management of vessels by the VTS system.","Immune genetic,Abnormal behavior detection,Automatic identification system (AIS),Spectral clustering,Duplicato-degree measurement,Intelligent vessel supervision,"

"on the effectiveness of ai-assisted anomaly detection methods in maritime navigation","2020","The automatic identification system (AIS) has become an essential tool for maritime security. Nevertheless, how to effectively use the static and dynamic voyage information of the AIS data in maritime traffic situation awareness is still a challenge. This paper presents a comparative study of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques on their effectiveness in dealing with various anomalies in maritime domain using the AIS data. The AIS on-off switching (OOS) anomaly is critical in maritime security, since AIS technology is susceptible to manipulation and it can be switched on and off to hide illegal activities. Thus, we try to detect and distinguish between intentional and non-intentional AIS OOS anomalies through our AI -assisted anomaly detection framework.

"“ship-port-country” multi-dimensional research on the fine analysis of china's lng trade","2023","Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) is a clean and low-carbon energy source that plays an important role in combating global warming. As the world's largest greenhouse gas (GHG) emitter, China has taken coal-to-gas as an important measure to reduce GHG emissions, and has become the world's largest LNG importer. Studying the patterns and characteristics of China's LNG trade is of great significance for ensuring energy supply security, formulating and adjusting energy strategies. However, the refined analysis of China's LNG trade is still inadequate, mainly due to the lack of research on the details of ship trajectories and port attributes. Therefore, a “ship-port-country” multidimensional LNG trade analysis method is proposed to improve the timeliness, multi-dimensionality and fineness of China's LNG trade analysis. The multidimensional characteristics of China's LNG trade are analyzed by studying the big data of nearly 3.5 billion automatic identification system (AIS) records in 2017. The study has found that (1) The arrival frequency of China's LNG trading ships varies greatly with time. For example, the most frequent daily arrivals are between 04:00 and 05:00 in the morning, while the least frequent arrivals are between 15:00 and 17:00 in the afternoon. (2) The Chinese LNG trade network consisting of 79 ports has been formed, of which NANTONG Port is the most important port. (3) The LNG trade volume calculated in this study has shown a strong correlation with the national LNG trade statistics and can be used to analyze LNG trade with higher spatial and temporal resolution. According to the characteristics of LNG trade at the three levels of ship, port and country, China can optimize its LNG trade policy from the following aspects: (1) Dynamically allocate port resources according to the arrival frequency of LNG tankers to reduce port congestion and waste of resources. (2) Expand core LNG trading ports such as NANTONG Port, ZHOUSHAN Port, TANGSHAN (JINGTANG) Port, XIUYU Port, DALIAN Port and LUSHUN Port. (3) Actively realize the diversification of LNG trading partners to reduce the dependence of LNG import sources on one country or region, and ensure energy security. The “ship-port-country” multi-level LNG trade analysis method proposed in this study provides a new research perspective for the analysis of the LNG trade pattern. This study reveals the multidimensional characteristics of China's LNG trade, which can provide decision-making support for China to formulate reasonable LNG trade policies and energy security policies, and is conducive to the stable and sustainable development of global LNG trade.","Multidimensional analysis,Ship trajectory data,China's LNG trade,LNG trade,Fine-grained trade characteristics,"

"object segmentation from a dynamic background using a pixelwise rigidity criterion and application to maritime target recognition","2014","This paper describes a novel approach for rigid object segmentation from a dynamic background using a pre-recorded video with a moving camera, and we apply it to the problem of vessel segmentation in a maritime video scene. The difficulty of modeling background appearance or/and dynamic, modeling object appearance, and compensating camera motion renders this task very challenging. Therefore, the proposed method only uses a geometric constraint regarding target motion rigidity in order to achieve object segmentation in a full video segment. Such an idea is not new in object segmentation literature, but the novelty in this paper resides in that the target rigidity assumption is implemented at the pixel level, but not at the object scale. This is firstly achieved by deriving a theoretical optic flow model in the neighborhood of each pixel under the 3D rigid motion assumption of object, which is later compared against the observed 2D optic flow model in the neighborhood of a pixel in order to derive a pixelwise rigidity criterion.

"maritime traffic monitoring based on vessel detection, tracking, state estimation, and trajectory prediction","2012","Maneuvering vessel detection and tracking (VDT), incorporated with state estimation and trajectory prediction, are important tasks for vessel navigational systems (VNSs), as well as vessel traffic monitoring and information systems (VTMISs) to improve maritime safety and security in ocean navigation. Although conventional VNSs and VTMISs are equipped with maritime surveillance systems for the same purpose, intelligent capabilities for vessel detection, tracking, state estimation, and navigational trajectory prediction are underdeveloped. Therefore, the integration of intelligent features into VTMISs is proposed in this paper. The first part of this paper is focused on detecting and tracking of a multiple-vessel situation. An artificial neural network (ANN) is proposed as the mechanism for detecting and tracking multiple vessels. In the second part of this paper, vessel state estimation and navigational trajectory prediction of a single-vessel situation are considered.

"influence of atmospheric circulation and local parameters on activity concentration of gross alpha and gross beta in granada, spain","2023","This work analyses the influence of local meteorology and air mass origin on radioactivity levels measured in Granada (Southern Spain). To the scope, gross α and gross β activities at ground-level air were weekly recorded from 2006 to 2021, by collecting aerosol filters and successively analysing them by low-level proportional counting. Time series decomposition shows a strong correlation between the seasonal components of gross α and gross β and the local meteorological parameters, in particular temperature and wind speed. Back trajectories reaching the study area during the sampling, calculated at three height levels (750 m, 1500 m, and 3000 m a.s.l.), were analysed by three methods with the aim to determine the main characteristics of air masses reaching Granada, and their impact on airborne radioactivity levels. The results of the residence time and clustering analyses showed that an increase in the radioactivity levels in the southeast of Spain is connected with air masses coming from the Mediterranean at 750 m and from the South (Sahara Desert) at 3000 m. In line with the outcomes obtained by the cluster analysis, the Concentration Weighted Trajectory (WCWT) results highlight that the air masses transported from Mediterranean and African regions are a potential source of gross α and gross β. Moreover, the findings of the WCWT bring a new aspect by revealing that the southern France region can also have a significant contribution to gross alpha and beta activities.","Gross alpha,Radioactivity,Back-trajectories,Gross beta,Air masses,"

"robust infrared maritime target detection via anti-jitter spatialâ€“temporal trajectory consistency","2022","When detecting diverse infrared (IR) small maritime targets on complicated scenes, the existing methods get into trouble and unsatisfactory performance. The main reasons are as follows: 1) affected by target characteristics and ambient temperature and so on, both bright and dark targets may exist on IR maritime images in practical application and 2) spatial information and temporal correlation of targets are not fully excavated. To these problems, we propose a robust anti-jitter spatialâ€“temporal trajectory consistency (ASTTC) method, the main idea of which is to improve detection accuracy using single-frame detection followed by multi-frame decision. First, we innovatively design adaptive local gradient variation (ALGV) descriptor, which combines local dissimilarity measure with gradient magnitude distribution to enhance the local contrast for both bright and dark targets so that the suspected targets can be robustly extracted. For multi-frame decision, interframe displacement correction is necessary to eliminate the interference of IR imager motion and vibration for target codeword. We use pyramid optical flow to track feature point extracted by Shi-Tomasi to capture interframe registration coefficients. Then, the target position is corrected in the spatialâ€“temporal domain. Finally, a robust spatialâ€“temporal trajectory descriptor (STTD), which achieves target encoding and target trajectory consistency measurement, is designed to further confirm real targets and eliminate false targets. Experiments conducted on various real IR maritime image sequences demonstrate the applicability and robustness of ASTTC, which performs more satisfactorily than the existing methods in detection accuracy.","target characteristics,Pipelines,Optical imaging,ALGV descriptor,temporal correlation,robust spatial-temporal trajectory descriptor,image motion analysis,Feature extraction,gradient magnitude distribution,small-target detection,STTD,anti-jitter spatialâ€“temporal trajectory consistency (ASTTC),Adaptive local gradient variation (ALGV),Shi-Tomasi,robust infrared maritime target detection,multiframe decision,single-frame detection,robust anti-jitter spatial-temporal trajectory consistency,Target tracking,object detection,feature extraction,target encoding,IR imager motion,local dissimilarity measure,IR maritime image sequences,interframe registration capture,image registration,correlation methods,gradient methods,ASTTC,infrared imaging,Trajectory,image sequences,target trajectory consistency measurement,spatial information,Object detection,Adaptive optics,image capture,adaptive local gradient variation descriptor,"
"energy-efficient cyclical trajectory design for uav-aided maritime data collection in wind","2020","Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), especially fixed-wing ones that withstand strong winds, have great potential for oceanic exploration and research. This paper studies a UAVaided maritime data collection system with a fixed-wing UAV dispatched to collect data from marine buoys. We aim to minimize the UAV's energy consumption in completing the task by jointly optimizing the communication time scheduling among the buoys and the UAV's flight trajectory subject to wind effect, which is a non-convex problem and difficult to solve optimally. Existing techniques such as the successive convex approximation (SCA) method provide efficient sub-optimal solutions for collecting small/moderate data volume, whereas the solution heavily relies on the trajectory initialization and has not explicitly considered the wind effect, while the computational complexity and resulted trajectory complexity both become prohibitive for the task with large data volume. To this end, we propose a new cyclical trajectory design framework that can handle arbitrary data volume efficiently subject to wind effect. Specifically, the proposed UAV trajectory comprises multiple cyclical laps, each responsible for collecting only a subset of data and thereby significantly reducing the computational/trajectory complexity, which allows searching for better trajectory initialization that fits the buoys' topology and the wind. Numerical results show that the proposed cyclical scheme outperforms the benchmark oneflight-only scheme in general. Moreover, the optimized cyclical 8-shape trajectory can proactively exploit the wind and achieve lower energy consumption compared with the case without wind.","unmanned aerial vehicles,wind effect,energy-efficient cyclical trajectory design,convex approximation,Energy consumption,convex programming,Acceleration,scheduling,nonconvex problem,communication time scheduling,UAV trajectory,oceanic exploration,8-shape trajectory,Maritime data collection,data volume,trajectory initialization,Wind speed,unmanned aerial vehicle,strong winds,UAV energy consumption,marine buoys,UAV-aided maritime data collection,autonomous aerial vehicles,nonlinear programming,Unmanned aerial vehicles,Trajectory,energy consumption,cyclical trajectory design,computational complexity,multiple cyclical laps,sub-optimal solutions,Task analysis,UAV flight trajectory subject,Data collection,approximation theory,fixed-wing UAV,energy efficiency,"

This is done by the pre-extraction of contextual information as the baseline patterns of life (i.e., routes) in the area under investigation. In addition to a brief description of the approach to derive the routes, their characterization and representation is presented in support of exploitable knowledge to classify anomalies.

"maritime traffic route detection framework based on statistical density analysis from ais data using a clustering algorithm","2022","Maritime traffic routes by ships navigation vary according to country and geographic characteristics, and they differ according to the characteristics of the ships. In ocean areas adjacent to coasts, regulated routes are present, e.g., traffic separation scheme for ships entering and leaving; however, most ocean areas do not have such routes. Maritime traffic route research has been conducted based on computer engineering to create routes; however, ship characteristics were not considered. Thus, this article proposes a framework to generate maritime traffic routes using statistical density analysis. Here, automatic identification system (AIS) data are used to derive quantitative traffic routes. Preprocessing is applied to the AIS data, and a similar ship trajectory pattern is decomposed into a matrix based on the Hausdorffâ€“distance algorithm and then stored in a database. A similar pattern makes the AIS trajectory simple using the Douglasâ€“Peucker algorithm. In addition, density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) is performed to identify the waypoints of vessels then create routes by connecting waypoints. The width of maritime routes created based on a similar ship trajectory is subjected to kernel density estimation analysis (KDE). Then, waypoints evaluation of the main route is performed from the results of KDE 75% and 90% considering the statistical in the total maritime traffic, and the results applied to the targeted ocean area are compared. Finally, the result of KDE 90% of maritime traffic with framework analyzed the safety route, which can be a basis for developing routes for maritime autonomous surface ships.","traffic separation scheme,ocean areas,marine accidents,Clustering algorithms,Safety,targeted ocean area,Douglas-Peucker algorithm,automatic identification system data,vehicle routing,total maritime traffic,Marine vehicles,maritime autonomous surface ships,quantitative traffic routes,geographic characteristics,DBSCAN,statistical analysis,ships,marine safety,kernel density estimation,AIS trajectory simple,maritime traffic route detection framework,kernel density estimation analysis,Oceans,Hausdorff-distance algorithm,ship trajectory pattern,framework,pattern clustering,Artificial intelligence,statistical density analysis,marine engineering computing,Trajectory,ship characteristics,maritime traffic route research,Navigation,safety route,density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise,clustering algorithm,AIS data,maritime traffic route,"
"rainwater chemical composition at two sites in central mexico","2006","Chemical analyses were performed on rainwater samples collected at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) in Mexico City and at a wooded site, Rancho Viejo (RV) in the State of Mexico, for the periods 1994–2000 and 1994–1999, respectively. At UNAM, rainwater was collected for the entire rainy season period each year, while at RV, technical considerations limited collection to weekends only. The results showed large variations in rainwater chemical composition in most years, mainly because of the variability of meteorological conditions and also because of changes in source emissions. Sulfates and NH4+ showed higher annual volume-weighted mean concentrations (VWMC) in both sites. At UNAM, the maximum annual VWMC for SO42− occurred in March and the minimum in July and August. Lower concentrations of almost all ions were found at RV; however, the H+ concentration was higher at this site. The pH in Mexico City, calculated from the annual VWMC of H+, was 4.95, which is a little higher than pH values reported in some other countries. Despite the fact that sulfate and NO3− concentrations were lower at RV, the pH was lower. Air-mass back trajectories were calculated for individual concentrations of SO42−, H+, NH4+, Ca2+, and Mg2+, observed at each sampling site for weekend data. At RV, sulfate concentrations were higher when air-mass back trajectories indicated a wind flow from Mexico City and Toluca at 1000 MAGL (meters above ground level) and 3000 MAGL. The hydrogen ion exhibited the same behavior. Calcium and Mg2+ concentrations were also higher when the wind blew from urban areas at 1000 and 3000 MAGL. At UNAM, H+ concentration was lower and Ca2+ and Mg2+ were higher when wind blew from the northern sector of the city at 1000 and 3000 MAGL. In UNAM, the NO3−/SO42− and NH4+/SO42− ratios were 0.5 and 1.09 in 1994 and 0.86 and 1.64 in 2000, respectively, indicating a decrease in SO2 emissions resulting from the change of fuel oil to gas fuel. The SO42−/Ca2+ ratio was significantly lower at the UNAM site (1.82) compared to RV (5.36), and the SO42−/H+ ratio was significantly higher at the UNAM site (6.77) compared to RV (2.01). The Spearman's rho correlation between ionic concentrations indicated a positive correlation in most cases (p<0.05) for data from UNAM and RV. The multiple regression correlation analysis to predict H+ concentration in Mexico City showed that NO3−, NH4+, SO42−, and Ca2+ contributed 23.2%, 20.9%, 8.0%, and 6.1%, respectively, to the H+ prediction, while Cl− plus Na+ plus K+ only contributed 2.2%, and Mg2+ did not contribute. Sea-salt contribution to rainwater chemical composition was negligible with any wind direction at both levels. Excess sulfate (non-sea-salt sulfate) represented 98.7% of the total sulfate in rainwater collected during weekends at RV and 98.6% for weekend and annual rain samples at UNAM.","Central Mexico,Acidity in forests,Annual variations,Rainwater chemistry,"

"anomaly detection in maritime data based on geometrical analysis of trajectories","2015","Anomaly detection is an important use of the Automatic Identification Systems (AIS), because it offers support to users to evaluate if a vessel is in trouble or causing trouble. For instance, it can be used to detect if a ship is doing something that may cause an accident or if it has changed its route to avoid bad weather condition. In this work, a new method for finding anomalies in the ships' movements is proposed. The method analyzes the trajectory of ships from a geometrical perspective. The trajectory of the ship is compared with a near-optimal path that is generated by a graph search algorithm. The proposed method extracts some scale-invariant features from the real trajectory and also from the optimal movement pattern, and it compares the two sets of features to generate an abnormality score. The method is unsupervised and it does not require training. Instead of labeling the trajectories as normal/abnormal it calculates a score value that denotes the extent of abnormality. The scoring scheme provides a ranking system in which the user can sort the trajectories based on their abnormality score. This is useful when dealing with large number of trajectories and the user wants to picks the most abnormal cases. For the evaluation, the method was run on three months data of North Pacific Ocean and score values were generated. Among the entire dataset, 100 randomly chosen trajectories were labeled by an expert.

"a data mining method to extract traffic network for maritime transport management","2023","Maritime traffic network is essential for navigation efficiency and safety of the maritime transport system. This study proposes a framework for extracting maritime traffic network based on Automatic Identification System (AIS) data. The framework consists of maritime traffic pattern recognition, semantic routes extraction, route decomposition, and network generation. Firstly, a data-driven method is introduced to recognize ship behavior patterns and extends the single ship behaviors to regional characteristics to determine the departure-arrival areas. Then, based on the different combination of departure-arrival areas, the ship trajectories are classified to traffic groups. Subsequently, the grid-system is used to rasterize each traffic group, which realizes the fusion of trajectory data and geographic location information. Finally, to obtain the main routes and navigation channels, the extraction method is introduced by establishing the cumulative grid importance function. The main routes, together with the navigation channels, compose the maritime traffic network. The method is applied to AIS data in the Beibu Gulf, and the results show that the traffic network contains 12 stop areas, 4 entry/exit locations, 13 main routes as well as their corresponding navigation channels. It is therefore concluded that the proposed method helps (1) provide a theoretical framework to obtain and analyze the maritime traffic network and (2) enrich navigation channel identification methods for maritime transport management.","Maritime traffic network,Maritime transport management,AIS,Machine learning,Big data analytics,"

"footprints of fishing vessels in chinese waters based on automatic identification system data","2022","The importance and difficulty of large-scale quantitative analysis of fishing vessel footprints and fishing intensities with high resolution have received more and more attention and recognition in fishery research. In this study, a framework for identifying and analyzing fishing footprints and activities based on AIS data is proposed. The first step is the AIS data pre-processing. Through the screening and cleaning of AIS data, noise data such as non-fishing vessel trajectories are removed to retain only fishing vessel trajectories. The second step is the behavior detection of fishing vessels. Based on the proposed speed identification method, the trajectory of a fishing vessel is divided into three states: Fishing, stationary, and sailing. The third step is the calculation of fishing vessel activities. An adjacent point mean method is proposed to calculate the fishing time of each fishing point. In addition, two simple and efficient quantitative indicators, namely unit cell activity frequency (UCAF) and unit cell fishing time (UCFT), are proposed to quantify the activities of fishing vessels. The last step is the spatial and temporal analysis of fishing activities. The global Moran's index and Getis-Ord Gi* index are used to quantitatively describe the global spatio-temporal distribution and local spatio-temporal hotspots of fishing activities. Based on >130 million AIS data from 2015 to 2016, the footprints of fishing vessels in the waters of China's exclusive economic zone (EEZ) were analyzed and the 0.01° × 0.01° high-resolution fishing vessel activity distribution maps and fishing time distribution maps were generated.

"context learning from a ship trajectory cluster for anomaly detection","2023","This paper presents a context information extraction process over Automatic Identification System (AIS) real-world ship data, building a system with the capability to extract representative points of a trajectory cluster. With the trajectory cluster, the study proposes the use of trajectory segmentation algorithms to extract representative points of each trajectory and then use the k-means algorithm to obtain a series of centroids over all the representative points. These centroids, combined, form a new representative trajectory of the cluster. This new representative trajectory of the input cluster represents new contextual information extracted from the original set of trajectories, being possible to apply anomaly detection approaches over the new obtained context. The results show a suitable approach with several compression algorithms that are compared with a metric based on the Perpendicular Euclidean Distance.","Trajectory compression,Data mining,AIS data,Trajectory clustering,Context learning,"

"graph signal variation detection: a novel approach for identifying and reconstructing ship ais tangled trajectories","2023","Tangles are a common anomaly in Automatic Identification System (AIS) data, resulting from disorder in time sequences. They increase the spatial complexity of trajectories, making existing methods unable to fully recognize and process them. This will seriously affect the analysis of ship behavior. Furthermore, existing methods often directly remove after recognition, resulting in a significant loss of local information. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an algorithm called Graph Signal Variation Detection (GSVD) to recognize and reconstruct tangles. Initially, data preprocessing is conducted to remove redundant and stationary points. Then, construct the vertices and edges of the graph using indicators integrating AIS data features and ship trajectories, respectively. The tangled region is identified by calculating the total variation theory of the graph. The tangled region is reconstructed using the greedy heuristic, and the optimal reconstruction path is determined by combining total variation quantization. Finally, the GSVD is compared with four prevailing methods, through qualitative and quantitative analyses. The results demonstrate that the GSVD surpasses the other methods in terms of recognition accuracy, recall rates, and false alarm rates. Additionally, the GSVD can effectively reconstruct the tangle.","Total variation,Trajectory preprocessing,Graph signal,AIS data,Greedy algorithm,"
"a context-aware approach for vessels’ trajectory prediction","2023","An accurate vessel trajectory prediction can improve safety management at sea. Although the vessels' trajectories can be affected by complex and high dimensional context factors such as wind, wave size, and current, the research in incorporating them in trajectory prediction is still burgeoning. This paper proposes a context-aware data-driven framework for vessel trajectory prediction. In this regard, trajectories are enriched with context information at the first stage. This includes evaluating methods of trajectory annotation. Next, feature selection techniques are applied to solve the problems caused by high dimensionality, i.e., incensement in the complexity and the computational load. Finally, selected factors are used in a Context-aware Long Short-Term Memory (CLSTM) network. The implementations on the Automatic Identification System (AIS), weather, and ocean condition dataset around the English Channel collected during February 2016, indicated that the spline interpolation is suitable for trajectory annotation. Water depth, wave direction, and height are the most influencing context in vessels’ data-driven movement prediction. The predictions made by the proposed framework are 15.31% more accurate than the prediction of a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. Therefore, the proposed context-aware trajectory prediction framework might suit maritime systems and applications like collision avoidance, vessel route planning, and anomaly detection.",""
"cae: contextual auto-encoder for multivariate time-series anomaly detection in air transportation","2022","The Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast protocol is one of the latest compulsory advances in air surveillance. While it supports the tracking of the ever-growing number of aircraft in the air, it also introduces cybersecurity issues that must be mitigated e.g., false data injection attacks where an attacker emits fake surveillance information. The recent data sources and tools available to obtain flight tracking records allow the researchers to create datasets and develop Machine Learning models capable of detecting such anomalies in En-Route trajectories. In this context, we propose a novel multivariate anomaly detection model called Contextual Auto-Encoder (CAE). It uses the baseline of a regular LSTM-based auto-encoder but with several decoders, each getting data of a specific flight phase (e.g. climbing, cruising or descending) during its training. To illustrate the CAE’s efficiency, an evaluation dataset was created using real-life anomalies as well as realistically crafted trajectory modifications, with which the CAE as well as three anomaly detection models from the literature were evaluated. Results show that the CAE achieves better results in both accuracy and speed of detection. The dataset, the models implementations and the evaluation results are available in an online repository, thereby enabling replicability and facilitating future experiments.","Air traffic security,Anomaly detection,Multivariate time series,CAE,ADS-B,"
"data mining approach to shipping route characterization and anomaly detection based on ais data","2020","A data mining approach is presented for probabilistic characterization of maritime traffic and anomaly detection. The approach automatically groups historical traffic data provided by the Automatic Identification System in terms of ship types, sizes, final destinations and other characteristics that influence the maritime traffic patterns off the continental coast of Portugal. The approach consists of identifying relevant waypoints along a route where significant changes in the ships’ navigational behaviour are observed, such as changes in heading, using trajectory compression and clustering algorithms. This provides a vector-based representation of the ship routes consisting of straight legs and connecting turning sections that facilitates route probabilistic characterization and anomaly detection. The maritime traffic is characterized probabilistically at the identified route legs and waypoints in terms of lateral distribution of the trajectories and speed profile, which allows the characterization of the typical behaviour of a group of similar ships along a particular route. In the proposed approach heading changes are automatically detected using the Douglas and Peucker algorithm and clustered by the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise algorithm. The proposed method is applied to the characterization of southbound maritime traffic from the traffic separation scheme off Cape Roca to the ports of Lisbon, Setúbal and Sines. Finally, an example of ship trajectory anomaly detection based on the developed maritime traffic probabilistic models is provided.","Traffic characterization,Maritime traffic,Anomaly detection,Data mining,AIS data,"

The first platform is a derivative of Surrey's UoSAT-12 minisatellite, launched in April 1999 and operating successfully in-orbit. The minisatellite has been modified to accommodate a propulsion system capable of delivering up to 1700 m/s delta-V, enabling it to support a wide range of very low cost missions to LaGrange points, Near-Earth Objects, and the Moon. A mission to the Moon - dubbed “MoonShine” - is proposed as the first demonstration of the modified minisatellite beyond LEO. The second platform - Surrey's Interplanetary Platform - has been designed to support missions with delta-V requirements up to 3200 m/s, making it ideal for low cost missions to Mars and Venus, as well as Near Earth Objects (NEOs) and other interplanetary trajectories. Analysis has proved mission feasibility, identifying key challenges in both missions for developing cost-effective techniques for: spacecraft propulsion; navigation; autonomous operations; and a reliable safe mode strategy. To reduce mission risk, inherently failure resistant lunar and interplanetary trajectories are under study. In order to significantly reduce cost and increase reliability, both platforms can communicate with low-cost ground stations and exploit Surrey's experience in autonomous operations. The lunar minisatellite can provide up to 70 kg payload margin in lunar orbit for a total mission cost US$16–25 M. The interplanetary platform can deliver 20 kg of scientific payload to Mars or Venus orbit for a mission cost US$25–50 M. Together, the platforms will enable regular flight of payloads to the Moon and interplanetary space at unprecedented low cost.

"hourly composition of gas and particle phase pollutants at a central urban background site in milan, italy","2017","A comprehensive range of gas and particle phase pollutants were sampled at 1-hour time resolution in urban background Milan during summer 2012. Measurements include several soluble inorganic aerosols (Cl−,NO2−,NO3−,SO42−,Ca2+,K+,Mg2+,Na+,NH4+) and gases (HCl, HNO2,HNO3, NH3, NO, NO2,O3, SO2), organic, elemental and black carbon and meteorological parameters. Analysis methods used include mean diurnal pattern on weekdays and Sundays, pollution roses, bivariate polar plots and statistical models using backtrajectories. Results show how nitrous acid (HONO) was mainly formed heterogeneously at nighttime, with a dependence of its formation rate on NO2 consistent with observations during the last HONO campaign in Milan in summer 1998, although since 1998 a drop in HONO levels occurred following to the decrease of its precursors. Nitrate showed two main formation mechanisms: one occurring through N2O5 at nighttime and leading to nitrate formation onto existing particles; another occurring both daytime and nighttime following the homogeneous reaction of ammonia gas with nitric acid gas. Air masses reaching Milan influenced nitrate formation depending on their content in ammonia and the timing of arrival. Notwithstanding the low level of SO2 in Milan, its peaks were associated to point source emissions in the Po valley or shipping and power plant emissions SW of Milan, beyond the Apennines. A distinctive pattern for HCl was observed, featured by an afternoon peak and a morning minimum, and best correlated to atmospheric temperature, although it was not possible to identify any specific source. The ratio of primary-dominated organic carbon and elemental carbon on hourly PM2.5 resulted 1.7. Black carbon was highly correlated to elemental carbon and the average mass absorption coefficient resulted MAC=13.8 ± 0.2 m2 g−1.

"verification and intercomparison of global ocean eulerian near-surface currents","2023","The OceanPredict task team for Intercomparison and Validation (IV-TT) has established the CLASS4 data standard for routine forecast verification against selected reference observing platforms. The set of CLASS4 reference data has been recently extended to include near-surface currents derived from the trajectories of drifting buoys drogued at 15 m. We have applied these data to the Ocean Model, Analysis and Prediction System (OceanMAPS) at the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (ABoM) for verification and inter-comparison with Mercator Océan International ocean forecast system (MOi), the operational models of the Met Office, UK: Forecast Ocean Assimilation Model (FOAM) and Coupled Atmosphere-Land-Ocean-Ice Data Assimilation (CPLDA) systems, and the Global Ice Ocean Prediction System (GDPS-GIOPS) at the Canadian Centre for Meteorological and Environmental Prediction (CCMEP). The aims for this verification analysis are to extend the routine monitoring of the operational system; to assess the OceanMAPS skill against other models; and to inform our stakeholders of the OceanMAPS performance. We have evaluated the impacts of adding Stokes drift and tidal currents from separate global wave and global tide models to the model currents on the verification of currents. Including Stokes drift leads to significant improvements in representation and the metrics for model skill while inclusion of tides has no significant impact on the global statistics. Zonal currents have a stronger signal than the meridional currents as indicated by their high correlation with observations, and lower errors. This indicates zonal currents on average are more predictable and persistent than the meridional currents, resulting in improved representation in the models. Overall, MOi, and the new version of OceanMAPS (4.0i), and FOAM show marginally better performance against the observations relative to other models. Although there are significant differences in the configurations of the eight models under evaluation, all the models are shown to be remarkably statistically equivalent with consistent spatial and temporal patterns indicating the main differences are attributable to unrepresented processes. We therefore conclude that there is significant scope to further improve the representation of the modelled currents with the observations.","Intercomparison of global ocean models,Global drifter program,Ocean modelling,Ocean currents verification,"

As numerous small satellites were launched in recent years, millions of AIS messages are captured by these satellite AIS providers every day. The massive amount of data allow shipping firms and port operators to better predict vessels’ movement. In this study, a computational framework is developed to predict future trajectories and destinations of vessels by applying deep learning to the satellite AIS messages containing self-reporting positioning data.

They cannot distinguish behaviors whose space position is similar but the moving speed and direction are quite different. Some sub-trajectory clustering methods which presented similarity measures considering segment direction, speed, and angle could solve this problem, but they are not suitable to some application scenarios which should clustering the whole trajectories.

This paper is motivated to apply a semantic analysis method to explore potential mobility patterns from ship trajectories in inland river by combining semantic transformation and topic model. A coarse-grained semantic transformation model is firstly defined to translate each ship trajectory into a document containing a series of sequential motion words. A motion word is generally a synthetic semantic representation of three trajectory features (location, course and speed). All ship trajectories can then be examined and analyzed as a document corpus. A classic topic model (i.e. Latent Dirichlet Allocation, LDA) is employed to explore hidden ship mobility patterns from trajectory document corpus. The effectiveness of this approach is illustrated through a case study at Wuhan waterway, located at middle stream of Yangtze River in China.","Ship mobility pattern,Trajectory analysis,Topic modeling,Automatic identification system,"

The software has two modes of operation, Planning Mode and Execution Mode. In Planning Mode an operator can readily simulate a desired flight plan to determine mission feasibility. Key features of this mode include integration of forecast weather data and interactive trajectory planning. Harsh North Atlantic weather can jeopardize a mission, so running a simulation with predicted wind conditions may greatly reduce the risk of a UAV loss. In Execution Mode the operator can deploy an autonomous vehicle, change the route “on the fly”, hold the aircraft over a point of interest, and return the UAV to home base whenever necessary. In both modes the predicted and actual weather conditions are the key to mission success. All weather data required for these functions is automatically downloaded via the internet. Operation of the software, including interactive trajectory planning, weather observation, mission planning and execution, is achieved through a user-friendly graphical user interface. Simulation results, flight trajectories, and weather data can be saved for further analysis. Comparing missions with and without weather information, it was determined that meteorological information can have a very significant impact on the mission success or failure.

Multiple hypothesis testing suggests a framework to enlist reliable information from monitoring systems (coastal radars and space-born satellite sensors) in support of detection of anomalies, spoofing, and stealth deviations.

"traffic knowledge discovery from ais data","2013","Maritime Situational Awareness (i.e., an effective understanding of activities in and impacting the maritime environment) can be significantly improved by knowledge discovery of maritime traffic patterns. The recent build-up of terrestrial networks and satellite constellations of Automatic Identification System (AIS) receivers provides a rich source of cooperative vessel movement information. This vast amount of information can not be fully utilized by human operators and poses new storage and computational challenges. A compact representation of this rapidly increasing amount of information gives operational utility to data which would otherwise be ignored. This paper proposes an unsupervised and incremental learning approach to extract the historical traffic patterns from AIS data. The presented methodology called Traffic Route Extraction for Anomaly Detection (TREAD) effectively processes raw AIS data to infer different levels of contextual information, spanning from the identification of ports and off-shore platforms to spatial and temporal distributions of traffic routes. Furthermore, the accurate understanding of the historical traffic enables the classification and prediction of vessel behaviours as well as the detection of low-likelihood behaviours, or anomalies. The ultimate goal is to provide operators with a configurable knowledge framework supporting day by day decision making and general awareness of vessel pattern of life activity. The methodology is demonstrated via a real-world case study, which can be used as a reference data set for further analysis.","data mining,raw AIS data,traffic route extraction for anomaly detection,Vectors,TREAD,unsupervised learning,operational utility,maritime traffic patterns,unsupervised learning approach,incremental learning approach,low-likelihood behaviours,maritime situational awareness,automatic identification system,Knowledge discovery,marine engineering,Entropy,traffic information systems,configurable knowledge framework,traffic knowledge discovery,Trajectory,Receivers,Surveillance,Data mining,historical traffic patterns,"

"trajectory optimization for high-altitude long-endurance uav maritime radar surveillance","2020","For an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) carrying out a maritime radar surveillance mission, there is a tradeoff between maximizing information obtained from the search area and minimizing fuel consumption. This article presents an approach for the optimization of a UAV's trajectory for maritime radar wide area persistent surveillance to simultaneously minimize fuel consumption, maximize mean probability of detection, and minimize mean revisit time. Quintic polynomials are used to generate UAV trajectories due to their ability to provide complete and complex solutions while requiring few inputs. Furthermore, the UAV dynamics and surveillance mission requirements are used to ensure that a trajectory is realistic and mission compatible. A wide area search radar model is used within this article in conjunction with a discretized grid in order to determine the search area's mean probability of detection and mean revisit time.

"improved kinematic interpolation for ais trajectory reconstruction","2021","Ship trajectory information has made a significant contribution to the data-based research in analyzing maritime transportation and has facilitated the improvement of maritime safety. However, the AIS data, which consists of ship trajectory, inevitably contains noises or missing data that can interfere with the conclusion. In this paper, an improved kinematic interpolation is presented for AIS trajectory reconstruction, which integrates data preprocessing and interpolation that considers the ships' kinematic information. The improved kinematic reconstruction method includes four steps: (1) data preprocessing, (2) analysis of time interval distribution, (3) abnormal data detection and removal, (4) kinematic interpolation that takes the kinematic feature of ships (i.e., velocity and acceleration) into account, adding forward and backward track points to help correct the acceleration function of reconstruction points. The proposed method is tested on the AIS dataset of Zhoushan Port and was compared with traditional ship trajectory reconstruction methods. The comparison indicates that the proposed method can effectively reconstruct the ship trajectory with higher performance on a single ship trajectory and a large AIS data set of certain water areas.","Trajectory reconstruction,Ship trajectory,Kinematic interpolation,AIS,"
"discovering maritime traffic route from ais network","2016","The recent build-up network of Automatic Identification System (AIS) equipped on vessels provides a rich source of vessel movement information. AIS is originally designed for automatically exchanging navigation information, such as their unique identification, position, course, and speed, with nearby vessels and terrestrial receivers to affect collision avoidance and safety control. The collected sequences of AIS logs can be considered as maritime trajectory data, i.e., the sequences of location points with timestamps. This vast amount of AIS trajectory data can be collected and employed to achieve an awareness of maritime traffic knowledge. This paper is devoted to discovery of maritime traffic route from trajectory data generated by AIS networks. However, AIS trajectory data discovery is a challenging task because of the trajectory data is available with uncertainty. Furthermore, unlike the vehicles' movements are constrained by road networks, there is no such a sea route for vessels to follow in marine areas. To overcome the challenges, we propose a framework of Maritime Traffic Route Discovery (abbreviated as MTRD) to generate pattern-aware routes to achieve an effective understanding of maritime traffic awareness. The proposed framework is evaluated on real AIS data and the experimental results shows that the proposed MTRD is able to extract the marine traffic route effectively and provides a cornerstone of maritime traffic knowledge for traffic management, anomaly detection, and conflict analysis in the future.","data mining,MTRD,AIS trajectory data discovery,terrestrial receivers,anomaly detection,AIS logs,traffic management,marine navigation,Global Positioning System,vessel movement information,Trajectory pattern mining,Trajectory data,Electronic mail,AIS network,maritime traffic knowledge,automatic identification system,marine safety,location point sequences,maritime trajectory data,Artificial intelligence,safety control,vehicle movements,maritime traffic route discovery,Roads,Trajectory,Uncertainty,traffic engineering computing,AIS trajectory data,AIS System,Maritime Traffic knowledge,automatic navigation information exchange,collision avoidance,conflict analysis,Data mining,maritime traffic awareness,Traffic Route Discovery,"
"a deep encoder-decoder network for anomaly detection in driving trajectory behavior under spatio-temporal context","2022","Traditional trajectory anomaly detection aims to find abnormal trajectory points or sequences using data mining techniques. As a comparison, we focus on the evaluation of the anomalies of driving habits for different drivers based on their trajectory data. This is particularly important for the application of adjusting the amount of insurance in accordance with the driving behaviors. Instead of customizing rules for modeling various driving behaviors, we propose an end-to-end deep learning framework for driving trajectory anomaly detection, called STDTB-AD. Specifically, taking into account the fact that movement is spatial–temporal dependent, the study first partitions the whole road network into a series of spatial–temporal units, which have homogeneous properties of traffic flows. Then, the motion parameters (i.e., acceleration, speed, and direction) of driving trajectories falling within each spatio-temporal unit are calculated for representing context-aware features of drivers. This method is able to detect the deviation of movement from the normal traffic state on the spatial–temporal units. Finally, a variational autoencoder is utilized to quantify the abnormity degree of each driver according to the reconstruction probability of driving feature vector. Evaluations based on taxi trajectory data show that our model can consider both the spatial and temporal contexts for detecting driving behavior anomalies and achieve higher detection accuracy than traditional models based on either spatial or temporal context.","Anomaly detection,Driving behavior,Deep learning,Trajectory data,"

"a framework for maritime anti-collision pattern discovery from ais network","2019","The avoidance of collisions between ships in encounter situations is crucial to maritime traffic safety. Most research on maritime collision avoidance has focused on planning a safe path by which to avoid approaching ships in accordance with the requirements laid out in the International Regulations for Preventing Collision at Sea (COLREGs). The resulting solution provides reference for the navigator in planning movements to avoid collisions. Nonetheless, specific anti-collision actions are generally based on the experience of the navigator. This study differed from existing works in that we sought to derive collision avoidance behavior from the trajectory data of actual ships. The Automatic Identification System (AIS) network makes it possible to collect an enormous volume of trajectory data and investigate real-world ship behavior. Unfortunately trajectory data that introduces uncertainty can hinder behavior mining for collision avoidance. Irregular and/or asynchronous location sampling can lead to situations in which the movement of a ship does not necessarily follow a given trajectory, even if its movement behavior is similar to that of other ships. In this study, we developed a framework to decipher the anti-collision behavior of ships in encounter situations from a large database of trajectory data collected by AIS network, and to present this behavior in the form of anti-collision patterns. A prototype of the proposed framework was built to enable pattern analysis and visualization functions, thereby providing a deeper understanding of collision avoidance behavior in maritime traffic.

In order to respond to these changes in marine space, conducted this study on the change of maritime traffic patterns before and after the installation of floating LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) in marine facilities and apply it to future changes in maritime traffic patterns. The maritime traffic data was based on Automatic Identification System (AIS) data, and it was targeted at cargo ships and tankers with regular traffic patterns. A trajectory and spatial analysis were performed based on the AIS in the marine space. As a result of analyzing the globally maritime traffic patterns targeting the location of the installation complex of LiDARs, it can be confirmed that the existing maritime traffic patterns change into three maritime traffic patterns. Furthermore, the study employed the Hausdorff-distance algorithm for clustering analysis, categorizing vessels with similar trajectories. This approach facilitated a locally analysis of the buffer zone associated with individual LiDAR, considering the length of the vessels.

"an adaptive threshold fast dbscan algorithm with preserved trajectory feature points for vessel trajectory clustering","2023","Vessel navigation pattern recognition plays an important role in the research of intelligent transportation on water. Clustering using the data stored in The Automatic Identification System (AIS) is a current research hotspot. However, there are three problems in the past clustering analysis. First, the traditional Douglas-Peucker (DP) Compression Algorithm exists feature point loss and trajectory distortion when compressing trajectories. Second, Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm require high time cost. Finally, most of the studies ignore the interaction between parameters when choosing the parameters of DBSCAN. These problems seriously affect the efficiency and accuracy of clustering. To solve these problems, this paper improves the existing methods by (1) Adaptive selection of compression thresholds and trajectory feature points for each trajectory when using the DP algorithm ensures the realism of the compressed trajectory; (2) using the Fast-DTW algorithm to improve the computation speed and ensure the accuracy of trajectory similarity; (3) Self-selection of parameter combinations based on Silhouette Coefficient (SC) scores was achieved using the similarity distribution of the trajectories in combination with an improved K-Adaptive Nearest Neighbors (KANN).

In the first part of the proposed method, the appropriate parameters for the DP algorithm were determined according to the shape changes in the trajectories, which were used to compress the trajectories prior to calculating the dynamic time warping (DTW) distance matrix. In the second part, the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm was improved in terms of determining the parameters. Based on the statistical characteristics of ship trajectory distribution, the appropriate DBSCAN parameters could be determined adaptively.

"dbscan algorithm for ais data reconstruction","2021","Automatic Identification System (AIS) is a telecommunication system created to allow ships to communicate with each other by exchanging messages containing information such as vessel’s ID, position, speed, heading, etc. AIS is useful in many cases, such as early ship collision detection. However, its terrestrial segment’s drawback is a relatively low range (about 74 km, roughly 40 nautical miles). Satellite Automatic Identification System (SAT-AIS) was introduced to overcome this limitation, but it suffers from its own problem known as packet collision. The satellite receives messages from multiple terrestrial cells and communication is synchronized within such cells, but not between them, thus messages got lost or damaged when they appear at the satellite at the same time. In this paper, we present a machine learning-based approach to reconstruct those missing messages and deeply investigate whether or not a density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) can be considered in the first stage of the reconstruction. The experiment focuses on findig the optimal parameters for the clustering, running it both on original and damaged data to finally ascertain that DSBCAN can distinguish individual trajectories in a dataset that can be further reconstructed.","clustering,DBSCAN,AIS data analysis,trajectory reconstruction,AIS,"

This paper proposes a probabilistic conflict detection approach to estimate potential collision risk of various multi-vessel encounters, in which the spatiotemporal-dependent patterns of ship motions are newly taken into account through quantifying the trajectory uncertainty distributions using AIS data. The estimation accuracy and efficiency are assured by employing a two-stage Monte Carlo simulation algorithm, which provides the quantitative bounds on the approximation accuracy and allows for a fast estimation of conflict criticality. Several real experiments are conducted using the AIS-based trajectory data in Ningbo-Zhoushan Port to demonstrate the feasibility and superiority of the proposed new approach.

"deep reinforcement learning based trajectory optimization for magnetometer-mounted uav to landmine detection","2022","Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as a viable choice for data collection and landmine (LM) detection. The LM buried under the dirt or sand is detected using a UAV-mounted magnetometer in this paper. A UAV is deployed to gather data along the intended route when the magnetometer receives a signal from the LMs. During a whole round of data collection, we want to reduce the total energy consumption of the UAV-Magnetometer-LM system. To do this, we turn the energy consumption reduction issue into a limited combinatorial optimization problem by concurrently picking time slots and arranging the UAV’s visitation sequence to identify the LM. The problem of minimizing energy usage is NP-hard, making it difficult to solve optimally. In order to tackle this challenge, we used the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) scheme. DDPG is used to enhance the convergence speed and eliminate redundant computations. Furthermore, to improve the detection in real-time, we proposed the proximal online policy technique (POPT). Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme consumes 37.14%, 31.25%, and 21.42% better results than synthetic aperture radar (SAR), convolution neural network (CNN), and double deep recurrent Q-network (DDRQN).","DRL,Magnetometer,Landmine,Energy,UAV,"
"vc-gan: classifying vessel types by maritime trajectories using generative adversarial networks","2020","As maritime transport is the backbone of global trade, it is important to ensure the safety and security for sea transportation effectively. However, the dependence on experienced human operators for maritime surveillance does not scale in terms of coverage. While the ship information and trajectory data from the Automatic Identification System (AIS) can be used to automate maritime surveillance, the AIS data may be modified deliberately or accidentally, resulting in difficulties in the detection of illegal maritime activities. We have developed VC-GAN for Vessel Classification using Generative Adversarial Networks to identify vessel types based solely on the vessel trajectories in areas of interest. Our VC-GAN framework adversarially trains a multi-class classifier by learning from the labelled AIS data to classify the types of the vessels of interest, as well as to detect the out-of-class vessels. We evaluated the proposed VC-GAN method on two maritime datasets in Europe and Southeast Asia. The experimental results showed that VC-GAN significantly outperformed other vessel classification methods, especially in detecting out-of-class vessels.","ship information,VC-GAN framework,Transportation,maritime datasets,trajectory data,Generative adversarial networks,vessel classification methods,global trade,experienced human operators,neural nets,labelled AIS data,maritime trajectories,ships,marine safety,marine engineering,maritime transport,generative adversarial networks,Automatic Identification System,maritime surveillance,illegal maritime activities,image classification,sea transportation,vessel trajectories,Artificial intelligence,Maritime Trajectories,VC-GAN method,vessel types,Trajectory,multiclass classifier,Vessel Type Classification,Surveillance,Tools,learning (artificial intelligence),Security,out-of-class vessels,Generative Adversarial Networks,"
"novel climates: trajectories of climate change beyond the boundaries of british columbia’s forest management knowledge system","2018","The non-stationary climates of the 21st century are compelling forest managers to seek non-local species, provenances, and silvicultural regimes that are better suited to the anticipated future climates of their operating areas. Ideally, forest managers can source this information from climate analogs within their jurisdictions, but the emergence of unfamiliar climates is a distinct possibility with particular challenges. Here, we present an assessment of the emergence of mid-21st-century climates with no analog in the 20th-century climates of British Columbia (BC), and the extent to which these novel climates are described by climate analogs elsewhere in North America. We use a recently developed linear method of novel climate detection in parallel with Random Forest classification to evaluate the robustness of novel climate inferences. Our results suggest that a majority of the province’s area will remain free of novel climates over this time period, and therefore that BC’s ecological knowledge system, the Biogeoclimatic Ecosystem Classification, can remain the dominant source of climate analogs for mid-21st-century forest management planning horizons. Nevertheless, we detected a robust pattern of climates that are novel to BC in mid-21st-century climate projections at low elevations in the coastal, southern interior, and northeastern regions of the province. There appears to be potential to inform forest management in some of these novel climates with analogs from adjacent states and provinces. We demonstrate that extrapolations into novel climates typically understate the magnitude of climate change and modeling uncertainty, creating a false impression of robust predictions in locations where model performance is poorest. By identifying portions of their landscapes that are prone to emergence of novel climates, forest managers can avoid management errors and prioritize the search for analogs beyond the boundaries of their knowledge systems.","Mahalanobis distance,Bioclimate,No-analog,Novel climates,Random Forest,Biogeoclimatic ecosystem classification,"

"asynchronous trajectory matching-based multimodal maritime data fusion for vessel traffic surveillance in inland waterways","2023","The automatic identification system (AIS) and video cameras have been widely exploited for vessel traffic surveillance in inland waterways. The AIS data could provide vessel identity and dynamic information on vessel position and movements. In contrast, the video data could describe the visual appearances of moving vessels without knowing the information on identity, position, movements, etc. To further improve vessel traffic surveillance, it becomes necessary to fuse the AIS and video data to simultaneously capture the visual features, identity, and dynamic information for the vessels of interest. However, the performance of AIS and video data fusion is susceptible to issues such as data spatial difference, message asynchronous transmission, visual object occlusion, etc. In this work, we propose a deep learning-based simple online and real-time vessel data fusion method (termed DeepSORVF). We first extract the AIS-and video-based vessel trajectories, and then propose an asynchronous trajectory matching method to fuse the AIS-based vessel information with the corresponding visual targets. In addition, by combining the AIS-and video-based movement features, we also present a prior knowledge-driven anti-occlusion method to yield accurate and robust vessel tracking results under occlusion conditions. To validate the efficacy of our DeepSORVF, we have also constructed a new benchmark dataset (termed FVessel) for vessel detection, tracking, and data fusion. It consists of many videos and the corresponding AIS data collected in various weather conditions and locations. The experimental results have demonstrated that our method is capable of guaranteeing high-reliable data fusion and anti-occlusion vessel tracking.

"ais data-driven ship trajectory prediction modelling and analysis based on machine learning and deep learning methods","2023","Maritime transport faces new safety challenges in an increasingly complex traffic environment caused by large-scale and high-speed ships, particularly with the introduction of intelligent and autonomous ships. It is evident that Automatic Identification System (AIS) data-driven ship trajectory prediction can effectively aid in identifying abnormal ship behaviours and reducing maritime risks such as collision, stranding, and contact. Furthermore, trajectory prediction is widely recognised as one of the critical technologies for realising safe autonomous navigation. The prediction methods and their performance are the key factors for future safe and automatic shipping. Currently, ship trajectory prediction lacks the real performance measurement and analysis of different algorithms, including classical machine learning and emerging deep learning methods. This paper aims to systematically analyse the performance of ship trajectory prediction methods and pioneer experimental tests to reveal their advantages and disadvantages as well as fitness in different scenarios involving complicated systems. To do so, five machine learning methods (i.e., Kalman Filter (KF), Support Vector Progression (SVR), Back Propagation network (BP), Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), and Random Forest (RF)) and seven deep learning methods (i.e., Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gate Recurrent Unit (GRU), Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM), Sequence to Sequence (Seq2seq), Bi-directional Gate Recurrent Unit (Bi-GRU), and Transformer) are first extracted from the state-of-the-art literature review and then employed to implement the trajectory prediction and compare their prediction performance in the real world. Three AIS datasets are collected from the waters of representative traffic features, including a normal channel (i.e., the Chengshan Jiao Promontory), complex traffic (i.e., the Zhoushan Archipelago), and a port area (i.e., Caofeidian port). They are selected to test and analyse the performance of all twelve methods based on six evaluation indexes and explore the characteristics and effectiveness of the twelve trajectory prediction methods in detail. The experimental results provide a novel perspective, comparison, and benchmark for ship trajectory prediction research, which not only demonstrates the fitness of each method in different maritime traffic scenarios, but also makes significant contributions to maritime safety and autonomous shipping development.","Deep learning,Maritime safety,Trajectory prediction,AIS data,Machine learning,"
"a framework for discovering maritime traffic conflict from ais network","2017","Thanks for the common use of Automatic Identification System (AIS) network has made a large number of the maritime traffic data to be available. Ships equipped with AIS automatically exchange navigational information with nearby ships and terrestrial AIS receivers to facilitate the tracking and monitoring of ships' location and movement for collision avoidance and control. Obviously, with increasing amount of maritime shipping traffic, the navigational collisions are one of the growing safety concerns in maritime traffic situation awareness. To understand the collision situations can help the maritime traffic managers to improve the safety control of maritime traffic. However, it is difficult to statistically analyze such collision due to the number of collected real cases of collisions are relatively low within a short period of time. To overcome the problem of low sample size, we discover traffic conflict from data collected by AIS network to substitute the real collision. Given a set of maritime traffic data collected from AIS network, we try to discover ships' movements that have conflict behaviors and these behaviors may bring a possible collision if they do not take any evasive action. We propose a framework of Clustering-and-Detection to automatically discover the clusters of conflict trajectory from AIS trajectory data in an unsupervised way. Based on real AIS data, the experimental results show that the proposed framework is able to effectively discover sets of trajectory with conflict situation from maritime AIS traffic data. The statistical analysis on the discovered sets of conflict trajectory is able to provide useful knowledge for maritime traffic monitoring.","maritime traffic situation awareness,maritime traffic monitoring,maritime shipping traffic,maritime traffic conflict,maritime AIS traffic data,collision situations,Safety,maritime traffic data,Automatic Identification System network,Marine vehicles,AIS network,ships,marine safety,marine engineering,real AIS data,terrestrial AIS receivers,pattern clustering,Trajectory data mining,Artificial intelligence,safety control,conflict behaviors,clustering-and-detection,AIS data,Roads,Trajectory,conflict trajectory,conflict situation,Conflict detection,Maritime traffic data,Navigation,navigation,nearby ships,collision avoidance,Data mining,navigational collisions,maritime traffic managers,Navigation collision,"

First, we apply Density Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) to generate patterns from original trajectories. Second, we extract gravity vectors and sample stop points from clusters to retain stop and move information and to reduce the further computation cost. To measure the similarity between trajectory points and clusters, cluster relative distance and cluster angular distance are proposed.

"data-driven trajectory quality improvement for promoting intelligent vessel traffic services in 6g-enabled maritime iot systems","2021","Future generation communication systems, such as 5G and 6G wireless systems, exploit the combined satellite-terrestrial communication infrastructures to extend network coverage and data throughput for data-driven applications. These ground-breaking techniques have promoted the rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT) in maritime industries. In maritime IoT applications, intelligent vessel traffic services can be guaranteed by collecting and analyzing high volume of spatial data flows from automatic identification system (AIS). This AIS system includes a highly integrated automatic equipment, including functionalities of core communication, tracking, and sensing. The increased utilization of shipboard AIS devices allows the collection of massive trajectory data. However, the received raw AIS data often suffers from undesirable outliers (i.e., poorly tracked timestamped points for vessel trajectories) during signal acquisition and analog-to-digital conversion. The degraded AIS data will bring negative effects on vessel traffic services (e.g., maritime traffic monitoring, intelligent maritime navigation, vessel collision avoidance, etc.) in maritime IoT scenarios. To improve the quality of vessel trajectory records from AIS networks, we propose to develop a two-phase data-driven machine learning framework for vessel trajectory reconstruction. In particular, a density-based clustering method is introduced in the first phase to automatically recognize the undesirable outliers. The second phase proposes a bidirectional long short-term memory (BLSTM)-based supervised learning technique to restore the timestamped points degraded by random outliers in vessel trajectories. Comprehensive experiments on simulated and realistic data sets have verified the dominance of our two-phase vessel reconstruction framework compared to other competing methods.

It includes the presentation and discussion of the Conformal Anomaly Detector (CAD) and the computationally more efficient Inductive Conformal Anomaly Detector (ICAD), which are general algorithms for unsupervised or semi-supervised and offline or online anomaly detection.

Similar to conformal prediction, the choice of Nonconformity Measure (NCM) is of central importance for the classification performance of CAD and ICAD. A novel NCM for examples that are represented as sets of points is presented. One of the key properties of this NCM, which is known as the directed Hausdorff k-nearest neighbors (DH-kNN) NCM, is that the p-value for an incomplete test example monotonically decreases as more data points are observed. An instance of CAD based on DH-kNN NCM, known as the sequential Hausdorff nearest neighbor conformal anomaly detector (SHNN-CAD), is presented and discussed for sequential anomaly detection applications.

Among them, the authors recently proposed to take advantage of the target extent measurements for single or multiple-target tracking. This work was based on a point source hypothesis regarding the position measurement of each target. However, this is no longer suitable for extended target tracking.

In this method, the ship trajectory with rich position information is transformed into a ship trip semantic object (STSO) with semantic information, and each ship trip is abstracted as a “stop-waypoint-stop” trip object. In addition, based on the graph theory, the STSO is further integrated into the nodes and edges of a directed maritime traffic graph to realize the extraction and expression of the shipping routes.

Traditional approaches for trajectory prediction face challenges in accurately quantifying uncertainties, thereby limiting effectiveness in decision-making. To address this challenge, we propose a hybrid interval prediction frame of vessel trajectory using the lower and upper bound estimation (LUBE) and attention-modified long short-term memory (LSTM) network with bayesian optimization (BO). Firstly, trajectory data is preprocessed to solve the scale irregularity. Then, a novel trajectory interval prediction model for perceiving the prediction uncertainties is designed based on an advanced attention-modified LSTM with interval prediction capability. Meanwhile, a supervised training strategy with differentiating the interval widths of latitude and longitude is put forward to devise sample labels for training the model. Additionally, a new prediction interval-based objective function is proposed considering the target of maximizing coverage and minimizing width of trajectory interval. The BO algorithm optimizes the weighted parameters in the LSTM network by minimizing the objective function value. Finally, cases from two water areas are implemented to test and verify the proposed method. The results illustrate the superiority of the proposed approach in (1) outperforming other methods used for comparison in both coverage probability and width criteria of prediction interval.

"maritime small target detection based on appearance stability and depth-normalized motion saliency in infrared video with dense sunglints","2023","Maritime infrared (IR) small target detection in dense sunglint environments has always been challenging. It is difficult for existing methods to distinguish the small target from dense and strong sea clutter because the sea clutter caused by the sunglints has similar spatialâ€“temporal characteristics to small targets. This article proposes a method based on appearance stability and depth-normalized motion saliency (AS-DNMS) for small target detection in IR videos or sequences. First, on each frame of the IR video, the isotropic salience measure (ISM) based on principal curvature filtering is proposed for target enhancement, and an adaptive threshold is used to extract a stable number of candidate targets. Then, we use improved pipeline filtering to form trajectory chains of the candidate targets extracted from the consecutive frames. To improve the matching accuracy of pipeline filtering, we propose an inverse optical flow method to predict the local images of the candidate targets. Third, the motion vectors of the candidate targets are extracted and depth-normalized. According to the principle of projection perspective, a depth normalization model based on the position of the sea-sky line is established, providing a simple and low-cost solution for acquiring depth information of maritime targets under sea-sky backgrounds. Finally, the appearance stability measure (ASM) and the depth-normalized motion saliency measure (DNMSM) are calculated to construct the AS-DNMS joint feature.

"a contextual hybrid model for vessel movement prediction","2021","Predicting the movement of the vessels can significantly improve the management of safety. While the movement can be a function of geographic contexts, the current systems and methods rarely incorporate contextual information into the analysis. This paper initially proposes a novel context-aware trajectoriesâ€™ simplification method to embed the effects of geographic context which guarantees the logical consistency of the compressed trajectories, and further suggests a hybrid method that is built upon a curvilinear model and deep neural networks. The proposed method employs contextual information to check the logical consistency of the curvilinear method and then, constructs a Context-aware Long Short-Term Memory (CLSTM) network that can take into account contextual variables, such as the vessel types. The proposed method can enhance the prediction accuracy while maintaining the logical consistency, through a recursive feedback loop.

The estimated compressed trajectories are 23% more similar to their original trajectories compared to currently used simplification methods.

"boom: bottleneck-aware opportunistic multicast strategy for cooperative maritime sensing","2023","With the advancements in sensing technologies, maritime sensing has become indispensable in various domains, including logistics, weather forecasting, and marine ranching. However, transmitting large volumes of sensing data faces many challenges in the maritime environment. Firstly, the transmissions purely depend on satellite links often costly and suffer from long propagation latency. On the other hand, traditional unicast transmission results in data duplication, wasting valuable marine communication resources. With the increasing density of sensing devices, the communication distance between maritime sensors has become closer, enabling the deployment of maritime opportunistic networks consisting of device-to-device links. Rather than using unicast transmission over satellite links, employing multicast with opportunistic routing enables simultaneous data transmission to multiple destinations and saves communication resources. Even though the multicast method can avoid redundancy, conducting multicast without considering the maritime characteristics (i.e., the dynamics and the distribution of sensors) may lead to inefficient data delivery. Through real-world experiments, we observe that devices located on the edges of the network have a relatively low receiving rate compared with internal ones and tend to be the bottleneck of the overall multicast progress. Based on this observation, we propose BOOM, a bottleneck-aware opportunistic multicast strategy aiming at reducing multicast latency, taking into account the influence of the bottleneck node and broadcasting rate. Prominently, within maritime scenarios challenged by extreme conditions such as storms, typhoons, and tsunamis, BOOMâ€™s emphasis encompasses the adaptability of multicast strategies, which necessitates dynamic adjustments in response to equipment failures and shifts in network topology. Through mathematical analysis, we prove the formation of opportunistic multicast is an NP-hard problem and further design a heuristic algorithm based on the convex-hull method to reduce the computational cost in strategy generation. We compare BOOM with four other algorithms using real-world maritime vessel trajectories in various scenarios. The simulation result illustrates that the BOOM achieves a significant reduction in transmission latency, which reduces 36% when sensors are sparsely located in water areas, and the reduction could reach up to 59% when sensors are more dense. Furthermore, in extreme environmental testing conditions, BOOM continues to outperform other algorithms in terms of completion time, with performance improvements of up to 39% and 49% in sparse and dense topology environments respectively.","Data communication,Sensors,Task analysis,Maritime Sensing,Multicast Strategy,Marine vehicles,Satellite broadcasting,Wireless sensor networks,Opportunistic Multicast,Unicast,"
"an intelligent decision algorithm for the generation of maritime search and rescue emergency response plans","2019","Maritime search and rescue (SAR) decisions are the most important part of maritime SAR operations. In the process of making maritime SAR decisions, a key factor affecting efficiency and success rate is how to quickly respond to accidents and develop an emergency response plan. At present, maritime SAR emergency response plans are still mostly obtained through a combination of drift prediction models and SAR experience. There is a lack of SAR resource scheduling and SAR task assignment. The primary purpose of this paper is to explore the possibility of using an intelligent decision-making algorithm to formulate maritime SAR emergency response plans so as to produce results more scientifically. First, the relevant research areas and research data are briefly introduced, and the main mathematical models involved in the optimal search theory are expounded. Next, key technologies involved in the process of maritime SAR emergency response plan generation, including the determination of search area, the scheduling of SAR resources, the allocation of search tasks, and the planning of search routes, are analyzed in detail. Two optimization model algorithms, namely the SAR resource scheduling model based on genetic simulated annealing algorithm (GSAA) and the regional task allocation algorithm based on space-time characteristics, are proposed as approaches to solving the problem of resource scheduling and task allocation. Finally, the effectiveness and optimization of the proposed algorithms are verified by analyzing the emergency response of a real case which occurred in the Bohai Sea and comparing the different schemes. Through the algorithm proposed in this paper, the efficiency of maritime SAR operations can be effectively improved and the loss of life and property can be reduced.","planning,marine accidents,emergency management,maritime SAR decision making,intelligent decision-making algorithm,Prediction algorithms,SAR experience,Marine vehicles,maritime SAR emergency response plan generation,Resource management,intelligent decision algorithm,scheduling,genetic simulated annealing algorithm,genetic algorithms,task allocation,resources scheduling,drift prediction models,marine safety,Bohai Sea,SAR resource scheduling model,GSAA,mathematical models,Maritime SAR,space-time characteristics,search tasks,simulated annealing,decision making,SAR task assignment,Optimization,search problems,Trajectory,optimization model algorithms,optimization,regional task allocation algorithm,Scheduling,Task analysis,maritime search and rescue emergency response plan generation,search routes,optimal search theory,"

"intelligent anomaly detection of trajectories for iot empowered maritime transportation systems","2023","The convergence of Maritime Transportation Systems (MTS) and Internet of Things (IoT) has led to the promising IoT-empowered MTS (IoT-MTS). However, abnormal trajectories of maritime transportation ships can have highly negative impacts on the management of IoT-MTS. Therefore, anomaly detection of trajectories is important for the successful deployment of IoT-MTS. In this paper, we propose a Transfer Learning based Trajectory Anomaly Detection strategy, named TLTAD, for IoT-MTS. Specifically, a variational autoencoder is used to discover the potential connections between each dimension of the normal trajectory, while a graph variational autoencoder is used to explore the spatial similarity between normal trajectories. Based on internal connection of trajectories, a deep reinforcement learning algorithm, Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic policy gradient (TD3), is employed to train the trajectory anomaly detection model. To reduce the model training time, transfer learning is used to migrate the trained anomaly detection model between different regions of an ocean area or between similar ocean areas. Moreover, an efficient data transformation module is designed to improve the efficiency of model transfer. The experiments were conducted on a real-world automatic identification system (AIS) dataset. The results indicate that the proposed TLTAD can provide accurate anomaly detection on shipsâ€™ trajectories in IoT-MTS with reduced model training times.","reduced model training times,Transportation,deep learning (artificial intelligence),Anomaly detection,maritime transportation systems,anomaly detection,Internet of Things,transportation,Marine vehicles,abnormal trajectories,Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic policy gradient,highly negative impacts,model training time,ships,IoT-MTS,trajectory anomaly detection model,deep reinforcement learning algorithm,Data models,normal trajectory,reinforcement learning,maritime transportation ships,Artificial intelligence,real-world automatic identification system dataset,Maritime Transportation Systems,graph variational autoencoder,trained anomaly detection model,Trajectory Anomaly Detection strategy,gradient methods,Deep reinforcement learning,model transfer,Trajectory,promising IoT-empowered MTS,intelligent Anomaly Detection,transfer learning,learning (artificial intelligence),data handling,Analytical models,"
"analysis of the activities of high sea fishing vessels from china, japan, and korea via ais data mining","2023","In addition to offshore fishing, high sea fishing has become another important supply channel for seafood. The pelagic catches of China, Japan, and Korea (CJK) account for 60% of the global total, and an analysis of their activities adds essential clarity regarding global fishery resources. This paper develops a framework for analyzing the activities of HSF vessels based on satellite AIS data from 2019, which is used to study the spatial-temporal characteristics of the lengths, speeds, trajectories, and trajectory densities of HSF vessels, the numbers of active vessels, and their average fishing times. The analysis results show that: 1) Chinese HSF vessels are mostly small, relative to Japanese and Korean ships; 2) The speed of Japanese HSF vessels is consistently the highest; 3) All HSF vessels mainly fish in the Northwest Pacific, Western Central Pacific, Eastern Central Pacific, Southeast Pacific, Eastern Central Atlantic, Southeast Atlantic, and Western Indian Oceans; 4) The trajectory distribution of Chinese and Japanese vessels are similar, and both are more widely distributed than Korean vessels; 5) Chinese and Korean HSF vessels mostly enter the Atlantic through the Drake Passage, while Japanese ships mostly enter through the Panama Canal; 6) Chinese HSF vessels fish in Antarctic fisheries all year, while Korean ships aim to fish in Antarctic fisheries in the Spring, Summer, and Winter; 7) China has the largest number of HSF vessels in all fisheries, but their average fishing time is the shortest; 8) The average fishing time of all HSF vessels in Spring and Summer is short, increases during the Autumn, and continues to rise in some fisheries during Winter. This study is not only of great significance for the management and conservation of marine resources, but is also a valuable reference for the promotion of international cooperation in safeguarding marine fisheries.","High sea fishing,Pelagic fishery,Fishing vessel,Japan and Korea,China,AIS,"

Group motion analysis includes these challenges: (1) represent complex motion patterns of multiple entities as they execute group maneuvers and behavior patterns; (2) learn these group motion patterns in a qualitative fashion, invariant to the number of entities participating; (3) recognize such learned maneuvers and behaviors as they unfold in future group tracking data; and (4) detect in real-time deviations of an entity from a recognized group maneuver or behavior, as such motion anomalies may indicate a vessel emerging from a group. The approach adopts a linear field theory to represent the relative motions of objects, in combination with learning & recognition methods that self-organize three evolving field parameters into 3D clusters that represent maneuver categories, and categories sequences that represent behaviors.","Pattern recognition,motion analysis,image motion analysis,complex motion pattern representation,behavior pattern,learning methods,maritime group motion analysis,group tracking data,object tracking,marine engineering,object detection,group maneuvers,Tensile stress,Real-time systems,Indexes,Tracking,deviation detection,Trajectory,linear field theory,Sensors,maneuver behavior patterns,real-time deviations,learning (artificial intelligence),Group tracks,motion anomalies,"
"deeptracks: geopositioning maritime vehicles in video acquired from a moving platform","2021","Geopositioning and tracking a moving boat at sea is a very challenging problem, requiring boat detection, matching and estimating its GPS location from imagery with no common features. The problem can be stated as follows: given imagery from a camera mounted on a moving platform with known GPS location as the only valid sensor, we predict the geoposition of a target boat visible in images. Our solution uses recent ML algorithms, the camera-scene geometry and Bayesian filtering. The proposed pipeline first detects and tracks the target boatâ€™s location in the image with the strategy of tracking by detection. This image location is then converted to geoposition to the local sea coordinates referenced to the camera GPS location using plane projective geometry. Finally, target boat local coordinates are transformed to global GPS coordinates to estimate the geoposition. To achieve a smooth geotrajectory, we apply unscented Kalman filter (UKF) which implicitly overcomes small detection errors in the early stages of the pipeline. We tested the performance of our approach using GPS ground truth and show the accuracy and speed of the estimated geopositions. The source code will be made public once the paper is accepted.","Pipelines,DeepTracks,Kalman filters,Object Tracking by Detection,geoposition,Prediction algorithms,global GPS,Bayes methods,Cameras,Bayesian filtering,camera GPS location,pipeline,maritime vehicle geopositioning,Global Positioning System,image location,Unscented Kalman Filter,UKF,Filtering,camera-scene geometry,boats,unscented Kalman filter,Target tracking,cameras,object detection,video signal processing,moving platform,boat detection,marine engineering computing,GPS ground truth,plane projective geometry,local sea coordinates,Plane Projective Geometry,Boats,Geopositioning,GPS location,moving boat,ML algorithms,Deep Learning,target boat local coordinates,"
"detecting anomalous deviations from standard maritime routes using the ornsteinâ€“uhlenbeck process","2018","A novel anomaly detection procedure based on the Ornsteinâ€“Uhlenbeck (OU) mean-reverting stochastic process is presented. The considered anomaly is a vessel that deviates from a planned route, changing its nominal velocity $\boldsymbol{v}_0$. In order to hide this behavior, the vessel switches off its automatic identification system (AIS) device for a time  $T$ and then tries to revert to the previous nominal velocity $\boldsymbol{v}_0$. The decision that has to be made is declaring that a deviation either happened or not, relying only upon two consecutive AIS contacts. Furthermore, the extension to the scenario in which multiple contacts (e.g., radar) are available during the time period $T$ is also considered. A proper statistical hypothesis testing procedure that builds on the changes in the OU process long-term velocity parameter $\boldsymbol{v}_0$ of the vessel is the core of the proposed approach and enables the solution of the anomaly detection problem. Closed analytical forms are provided for the detection and false alarm probabilities of the hypothesis test.","real-world data,AIS contacts,Anomaly detection,anomaly detection problem,Marine vehicles,mean-reverting stochastic process,statistical hypothesis testing,target tracking,Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process,automatic identification system,marine engineering,stochastic processes,statistical testing,radar,long term prediction of vessel motion,standard maritime routes,Ornsteinâ€“Uhlenbeck process,Artificial intelligence,maritime anomaly detection,Maritime surveillance,statistical hypothesis test,Trajectory,probability,anomalous deviation detection,Transponders,marine communication,anomaly detection procedure,Spaceborne radar,"
"a new road safety indicator based on vehicle trajectory analysis","2016","In 2014, in France, accidents on rural roads accounted for roughly 63% of road mortality (ONISR, 2014). Yet, the locations of accidents are increasingly spread, and it is becoming difficult for road managers to set priorities for interventions on their road network. They can no longer base their strategy on accident analysis. Road managers need to quickly measure the effectiveness of a modified facility, improvement of facilities or modification of the environment. On this type of site accident analysis requires a period of 3 to 5 years to determine the effectiveness of a change. This period of time does not meet the requirements of road managers or road users. To provide a high safety level, managers are implementing innovative developments: wall effect chicane at crossroads, dynamic warning signs, rural roundabouts, etc. Managers want to quickly assess these innovations. In addition, they have less and less money, so it is necessary to give them tools to help prioritize their intervention. It is also preferable for road managers to take preventive action rather than having to wait for accidents or serious injuries to occur, in order to carry out diagnosis and propose countermeasures. In this article, we propose a new safety indicator based on trajectory analysis. By trajectory, we mean a time-function that describes vehicle movement including not only its path on the road but also speeds and accelerations in both horizontal directions (longitudinal and transverse). These trajectories describe vehicle/infrastructure/driver interactions and reveal inadequacies that can lead to accidents. These trajectories are obtained using two roadside observation systems that analyse vehicle trajectories on two specific locations: curves and intersections on rural roads. The first tool is a local trajectory measurement system. It records trajectories of all vehicles passing through a specific zone. The goal is to observe abnormal paths that reveal dysfunctions in the vehicle/Infrastructure/driver system. The main applications-related contribution of this work focuses on developing a comprehensive solution for accurately estimating vehicle trajectories based on a combination of video images and range finder (telemeter) measurements. The purpose of the second tool is to improve understanding of dysfunctions at a crossroads and to evaluate the effectiveness of facilities. A precise study of patterns encountered on accident-prone intersections on rural roads showed that some situations are much more dangerous and frequent than others. In particular, most accidents at intersections are caused by vehicles crossing main roads. The second system presented in this paper detects and records conflicts between users on the secondary road who are crossing the main road, and users driving straight ahead on the main road. This kind of conflict represents the main type of accidents called crossing at grade accidents. The proposed risk indicator is equal to the number of conflicts (near-misses), weighted by the severity of the conflicts recorded in a given period. We chose to take the number of conflicts per hour. The purpose of these tools is to understand anomalies in the vehicle/infrastructure/driver system, and to evaluate the effectiveness of countermeasures on safety. Associated with risk indicators they make it possible to objectively assess driver behaviours with respect to the road infrastructure.","safety,trajectories,curves,intersections,evaluation,"
"supporting maritime search and rescue missions through uas-based wireless localization","2018","The use of unmanned aircraft systems to support maritime search and rescue missions holds great potential. Applications range from the fast and efficient search of vessels and persons in distress to the provision of rescue and communication resources. In this paper, we address a received signal strength based localization method of persons without dedicated search and rescue equipment. The specific challenge addressed in this work is to analyze the proposed localization method under realistic conditions. Thus, a maritime channel model is implemented and by means of field tests experimentally validated. Furthermore, the proposed approach is evaluated in a two step concept: In the first step the capability of different search patterns and localization algorithms is analyzed and evaluated in a hardware in the loop simulation environment. In the second step, a scaled experimental setup, which uses a technology comparable to cellular communications, is evaluated to prove the viability of the overall system. Besides the overall accuracy, the required localization time is a key performance indicator. The resulting outcome of the simulations using active trajectory generation underlines the potential of the discussed approach by achieving localization errors of lower than 200 m in under 10 mins. The experimental results obtained in the outdoor field test of under 30 m absolute euclidean error confirm the simulative results and verify that the proposed concept can significantly improve search and rescue operations.","Channel models,rescue missions,active trajectory generation,outdoor field test,Aircraft,hardware-in-the loop simulation,Wireless communication,Synthetic aperture radar,cellular communications,maritime channel model,cellular radio,rescue operations,Hardware,hardware in the loop simulation,communication resources,search patterns,unmanned aircraft systems,maritime search,required localization time,UAS-based wireless localization,Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS),autonomous aerial vehicles,Search and Rescue (SAR),Wireless Localization,Trajectory,RSSI,Received Signal Strength,localization errors,Physics,marine communication,received signal strength,euclidean error,"
"deep reinforcement learning based latency minimization for mobile edge computing with virtualization in maritime uav communication network","2022","The rapid development of maritime activities has led to the emergence of more and more computation-intensive applications. In order to meet the huge demand for wireless communications in maritime environment, mobile edge computing (MEC) is considered as an effective solution to provide powerful computing capabilities for maritime terminals of resource scarcity or latency sensitive. A basic technology to implement MEC is virtual machine (VM) multiplexing, through which multi-task parallel computing on a server is realized. In this paper, a two-layer unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) maritime communication network with a centralized top-UAV (T-UAV) and a group of distributed bottom-UAVs (B-UAVs) is established and MEC is used on T-UAV. We aim to solve the latency minimization problem for both communication and computation in this maritime UAV swarm mobile edge computing network. We reformulate this problem into a Markov decision process (MDP), since it is a non-convex and multiply constrained but has the characteristics of MDP. Based on this MDP model, we take deep reinforcement learning (DRL) as our tool to propose a deep Q-network (DQN) and a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithms to optimize the trajectory of T-UAV and configuration of virtual machines (VMs). Using these two proposed algorithms, we can minimize the system latency.

"olive groves around the lake. a ten-thousand-year history of a cretan landscape (greece) reveals the dominant role of humans in making this mediterranean ecosystem","2021","The reconstruction of millennial-scale interactions between ecosystems and societies can provide unique and valuable references for understanding the creation of cultural landscapes and help elucidate their value, weaknesses and legacies. Among the most emblematic forms of Mediterranean land use, olive groves and pastoralism have occupied a prominent place. Therefore, it is vital to know when, how, and with what ecological consequences these practices were established and developed. Located in the southern part of the Aegean Sea, Crete is the largest island of Greece. The island is characterised by a long human history of land use, but our understanding of past environmental changes for the entire Holocene is fragmentary. This paper presents a new investigation of Lake Kournas in Crete, where recent coring provided a 15-m sequence covering ten millennia of land cover and land-use history. The study of this new core involves the analysis of the sediment dynamics, flood deposits, pollen, diatoms, fungal and algal remains, and microcharcoals. Results show that ecosystem development near Lake Kournas was not a linear process. They reveal linkages and feedbacks between vegetation, biodiversity, fire, human impact, erosion, and climate change. A possible human occupation and agro-pastoral activities around the lake may have been detected as early as 9500 cal BP, perhaps in a transitional phase between the Mesolithic and the Neolithic. At 8500 cal BP, climatic conditions may have promoted the expansion of the evergreen oak woodland. However, human impact was probably the most important driver of ecosystem change with the establishment of an agro-system after 8000 years ago. Thereafter, the trajectory of Kournas’ lake and catchment ecosystems from the Mid to Late Holocene follow the rhythm of land-use change. Among the traditional Mediterranean land uses, olive cultivation locally played a major role in the socio-ecosystem interactions, providing economic benefits but also destabilising soils. During the last six millennia, three main phases of olive cultivation occurred during the Final Neolithic-Minoan period, the Hellenistic-Roman-Byzantine (HRB) period and Modern times. Along with the changing land use under the successive political and economic influences rules, the resilience capacities of vegetation permitted it to shift back to higher biodiversity again after decreasing phases. Forest vegetation was always able to recover until the onset of the Venetian period (13th century), when woodlands were dramatically reduced. Only during the past century has forest vegetation slightly recovered, while the flood regime had already been altered during previous centuries. During the past 100 years, biodiversity markedly declined, probably in response to the industrialization of agriculture.","Olive grove,Land-use,Crete,Mediterranean,Paleoecology,Anthropisation,Human impacts,Holocene,Socio-ecosystem,Biodiversity,"
"ship trajectory prediction based on machine learning and deep learning: a systematic review and methods analysis","2023","Ship trajectory prediction based on Automatic Identification System (AIS) data has attracted increasing interest as it helps prevent collision accidents and eliminate potential navigational conflicts. Therefore, it is necessary and urgent to conduct a systematic analysis of all the prediction methods to help reveal their advantages to ensure safety at sea in different scenarios. It is particularly important and significant within the context of unmanned ships forming a new hybrid maritime traffic together with manned ships in the future. This paper aims to conduct a comparative analysis of the up-to-date ship trajectory prediction algorithms based on machine learning and deep learning methods. To do so, five classical machine learning methods (i.e., Kalman Filter, Gaussian Process Regression, Support Vector Regression, Random Forest, and Back Propagation Network) and eight deep learning methods (i.e., Recurrent Neural Networks, Long Short-Term Memory, Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory, Gate Recurrent Unit, Bi-directional Gate Recurrent Unit, Sequence to Sequence, Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network, and Transformer) are thoroughly analysed and compared from the algorithm essence and applications to excavate their features and adaptability for manned and unmanned ships. The findings reveal the characteristics of various prediction methods and provide valuable implications for different stakeholders to guide the best-fit choice of a particular method as the solution under a specific circumstance. It also makes contributions to the extraction of the research difficulties of ship trajectory prediction and the corresponding solutions that are put forward to guide the development of future research.","Deep learning,Maritime safety,Hybrid maritime traffic,Trajectory prediction,AIS data,Machine learning,"

Sensors have been developed in this respect to track vessels and capture the maritime traffic at the global scale. The Automatic Identification System (AIS) is transmitting maritime positional and nominative information at highest frequency rate, making it a valuable source for maritime traffic modelling. From an original AIS dataset covering the area of Brest, France, we extracted a set of 17 maritime routes, connecting ports in this area. Two different representations for the routes are provided: (1) clusters of AIS contacts, and (2) route prototypes, representing the nominal trajectory of the vessels following the route. Additionally, a set of tracklets (built by five consecutive AIS contacts from the same vessel trajectory) has been extracted from the set of routes and the original dataset, and labelled either with the route name to which they belong or as off-route tracklets. This dataset provides thus some ground truth on the routes followed by vessels and is aimed at testing and validating vessel-to-route or track-to-route association algorithms.","Track-to-route association,Vessel-to-route association,Route prototypes,Maritime routes,Automatic identification system,"

"vertical profile of aerosol characteristics including activation over a rain shadow region in india","2021","Unique airborne observations of aerosol size spectral and chemical characteristics over the peninsular Indian region are illustrated in this case study. Multimodal lognormal distributions were required to fit the observed in situ aerosol size distribution. The aerosol composition and mixing state was deduced from the single-particle analyses of aerosols using the transmission electron microscope and soot photometer coupled with satellite retrieved aerosol classification, and back trajectory analyses. Organic carbon was the most prominent aerosol type found at all altitudes. Refractory black carbon aerosols which constituted about 10–12% of the aerosols in the boundary layer were primarily internally mixed with both inorganic and organic coating. Other major aerosol types were dust and sea salt, with the latter primarily found below 2 km. Further, the cloud forming ability of in-situ aerosols is tested through a cloud condensation nuclei closure analysis. The effective hygroscopicity decreased above cloud base due to the absence of sea salt aerosols. The change in large-scale winds with altitude affected the aerosol composition and hygroscopicity. The multimodal aerosol size distribution and hygroscopicity parameter (κ = 0.18) obtained for the cloud base aerosols over the rain shadow region are useful for studying aerosol-cloud interactions using regional cloud-resolving models.","CCN closure,CAIPEEX,Solapur,Lognormal distribution,Hygroscopicity parameter,"
"seaweed and climate change: a mapping review","2023","Seaweed has garnered increasing interest due to its capacity to mitigate climate change by curbing carbon emissions from agriculture, as well as its potential to serve as a supplement or alternative for dietary, livestock feed, or fuel source production. Moreover, seaweed is regarded as one of the earliest plant forms to have evolved on Earth. Owing to the extensive body of literature available and the uncertainty surrounding the future trajectory of seaweed research under evolving climate conditions, this review scrutinizes the structure, dynamics, and progression of the literature pertaining to seaweed and climate change. This analysis is grounded in the Web of Science Core Collection database, augmented by CiteSpace software. Furthermore, we discuss the productivity and influence of individual researchers, research organizations, countries, and scientific journals. To date, there have been 8047 articles published globally (after a series of filters and exclusions), with a notable upswing in publication frequency since 2018. The USA, China, and Australia are among the leading countries contributing to this research area. Our findings reveal that current research on seaweed and climate change encompasses 13 distinct research clusters, including “marine heatwave”, “temperate estuary”, “ocean acidification”, and “macroalgal bloom”. The most frequently cited keywords are “climate change”, “biomass”, “community”, and “photosynthesis”. The seaweed species most commonly referenced in relation to climate change include Gracilaria sp., Sargassum sp., Ecklonia maxima, and Macrocystis pyrifera. These results provide valuable guidance for shaping the direction of specialized topics concerning marine biodiversity under shifting climate conditions. We propose that seaweed production may be compromised during prolonged episodes of reduced water availability, emphasizing the need to formulate strategies to guarantee its continued viability. This article offers fresh perspectives on the analysis of seaweed research in the context of impending climate change.","Photosynthesis,Phytoplankton,Eutrophication,"
"safeway: improving the safety of autonomous waypoint detection in maritime using transformer and interpolation","2023","Detecting waypoints where vessels change their behavior (i.e., maneuvers, speed changes, etc.) is essential for optimizing vessel trajectories to increase the efficiency and safety of sailing. However, accurately detecting waypoints is challenging due to potential AIS data quality issues (i.e., missing or inaccurate messages). In this paper, we propose a five-step learning approach (SafeWay) to estimate waypoints on a given AIS trajectory. First, we interpolate trajectories to tackle AIS data quality issues. Then, we annotate historical trajectories by using an existing waypoint library that contains historical waypoints. As the historical waypoints are passage plans manually created by port operators considering sailing conditions at that time, they are not specific to other historical trajectories between the same ports. We, therefore, use a similarity metric to determine overlapping segments of historical trajectories with the historical waypoints from the waypoint library. Then, we build a transformer model to capture vessel movement patterns based on speed- and location-related features. We do not process location features directly to avoid learning location-specific context, but take into account tailored delta features. We test our approach on a real-world AIS dataset collected from the Norwegian Sea between Å lesund and Måløy and show its effectiveness in terms of a harmonic mean of purity and coverage, mean absolute error and detection rate on the task of detecting trajectory waypoints compared to a state-of-the-art approach. We also show the effectiveness of the trained model on the trajectories obtained from two other regions, the North Sea (London and Rotterdam) and the North Atlantic Ocean (Setubal and Gibraltar), on which the model has not been trained. The experiments indicate that our interpolation-enabled transformer design provides improvements in the safety of the estimated waypoints.","Transformers,Maritime,Interpolation,Safety,Trajectory prediction,Vessel,Maneuver,Waypoint detection,Automatic identification system,AIS,"

"cep-traj: an event-based solution to process trajectory data","2015","In this day and age, there exists an increasing need for systems and architectures able to process spatio-temporal data in a timely way. As a result, this paper presents CEP-traj, a novel middleware to ease the development of real-time trajectory-based services based on the Complex Event Processing (CEP) paradigm. By means of an event-based approach, the present middleware is able to detect a set of generic patterns along with meaningful changes of an entity׳s movement. In order to prove its suitability and feasibility, a vessel abnormal-behaviour detection system has been developed on the basis of the middleware׳s features. Finally, both synthetic and real datasets have been used to test the accuracy and performance of the middleware and the detection system implemented on top of the Esper engine.","Abnormal behaviour detection,Trajectory analysis,Trajectory pattern detection,Complex event processing,"
"a hierarchical graph-based model for mobility data representation and analysis","2022","Hierarchical representations of transportation networks should provide a better understanding of mobility patterns and the underlying structures at various abstraction levels. This paper introduces a hierarchical graph-based model for representing moving objects and trajectories according to multiple spatial, temporal and semantic scales. This formal model is implemented in a graph database and experimented with historical maritime data. Several experimental analyses explore and extract knowledge patterns from the hierarchical graph database. A series of queries applied to an European maritime network derive mobility patterns and highlight network structures.","Graph-based model,Maritime mobility,Network analysis,Hierarchical representation,Knowledge extraction,"
"multi-label classification for ais data anomaly detection using wavelet transform","2022","Thanks to the Automatic Identification System (AIS), ships and other maritime equipment are able to communicate with each other, for example, by sending information about their position. This solution allows for early collision detection when two or more ships are on a collision course. In the newer version of AIS, a satellite infrastructure is used to extend the communication range. Unfortunately, satellite AIS deals with so-called packet collision effect: since there is a problem with synchronizing AIS data coming from multiple terrestrial areas, a single satellite may receive several AIS messages at the same time and be unable to correctly process them, causing the data to get lost or garbled. In this article, a machine learning based framework for detecting the incorrect AIS data is presented. In this approach, after the first stage (clustering), a dedicated anomaly detection algorithm searches for damaged AIS messages and conducts multi-label classification (with Random Forest and wavelet transform) to decide which fields of such message requires further correction. The results of measuring the effectiveness of the proposed approach using real AIS data are presented.","telecommunication security,Clustering algorithms,incorrect AIS data,single satellite,Anomaly detection,Wavelet transforms,anomaly detection,random forests,collision course,Marine vehicles,Machine learning,damaged AIS messages,Data analysis,dedicated anomaly detection algorithm searches,satellite communication,ships,wavelet transform,pattern classification,random forest,Classification algorithms,multiple terrestrial areas,pattern clustering,machine learning based framework,Artificial intelligence,multi-label classification,multilabel classification,wavelet transforms,satellite infrastructure,AIS data anomaly detection,maritime equipment,communication range,Trajectory,marine communication,Labeling,early collision detection,AIS data analysis,packet collision effect,satellite AIS deals,"
"geotracknetâ€”a maritime anomaly detector using probabilistic neural network representation of ais tracks and a contrario detection","2022","Representing maritime traffic patterns and detecting anomalies from them are key to vessel monitoring and maritime situational awareness. We propose a novel approachâ€”referred to as GeoTrackNetâ€”for maritime anomaly detection from AIS data streams. Our model exploits state-of-the-art neural network schemes to learn a probabilistic representation of AIS tracks and a contrario detection to detect abnormal events. The neural network provides a new means to capture complex and heterogeneous patterns in vesselsâ€™ behaviours, while the a contrario detector takes into account the fact that the learnt distribution may be location-dependent. Experiments on a real AIS dataset comprising more than 4.2 million AIS messages demonstrate the relevance of the proposed method compared with state-of-the-art schemes.","heterogeneous patterns,motion estimation,GeoTrackNet,naval engineering computing,Anomaly detection,Geospatial analysis,anomaly detection,probabilistic representation,variational recurrent neural networks,AIS messages,maritime traffic patterns,maritime anomaly detector,AIS dataset,maritime situational awareness,neural nets,probabilistic neural network representation,deep learning,ships,marine engineering,AIS data streams,complex patterns,contrario detection,AIS,maritime surveillance,object detection,Probabilistic logic,a contrario detection,Artificial intelligence,maritime anomaly detection,Trajectory,Task analysis,vessel monitoring,contrario detector,learning (artificial intelligence),state-of-the-art neural network schemes,Detectors,AIS tracks,"

"advection pathways at the mt. cimone wmo-gaw station: seasonality, trends, and influence on atmospheric composition","2020","Relationships are analysed between advection pathways and atmospheric composition at the high-mountain station of Mt. Cimone (Italy), between 1998 and 2011. Back-trajectory cluster analysis identifies eight main advection pathways. A connection is demonstrated between the seasonality of airmass transport and atmospheric composition. Temporal trends and correlation of variables, flow types and teleconnection indices show, among other, decreasing trends of 210Pb (a radionuclide of crustal origin; −0.008 mBq m−3 year−1) as well as PM10 (−0.15 μg m−3 year−1), indicating that previously observed downward PM10 trends in Europe may actually be attributable to a combination of meteorological factors and decreasing anthropogenic emissions. The detection of a positive (negative) correlation of these tracers with Western (Arctic) air masses, showing significant downward (upward) trends at the study site, further confirms our findings. Lastly, relationships between teleconnection indices and atmospheric transport types/atmospheric variables are further analysed, focusing on large-scale atmospheric circulation indices and regional low-frequency atmospheric circulation pathways, the Mediterranean Oscillation and the Western Mediterranean Oscillation. The analysis reveals the important influence of such regional indices on the advection pathways.","Atmospheric radiotracers,Aerosol,Back-trajectories,Teleconnection,Trends,"

"a document-based data model for large scale computational maritime situational awareness","2015","Computational Maritime Situational Awareness (MSA) supports the maritime industry, governments, and international organizations with machine learning and big data techniques for analyzing vessel traffic data available through the Automatic Identification System (AIS). A critical challenge of scaling computational MSA to big data regimes is integrating the core learning algorithms with big data storage modes and data models. To address this challenge, we report results from our experimentation with MongoDB, a NoSQL document-based database which we test as a supporting platform for computational MSA. We experiment with a document model that avoids database joins when linking position and voyage AIS vessel information and allows tuning the database index and document sizes in response to the AIS data rate.

"leveraging graph and deep learning uncertainties to detect anomalous maritime trajectories","2022","Understanding and representing traffic patterns are key to detecting anomalous trajectories in the transportation domain. However, some trajectories can exhibit heterogeneous maneuvering characteristics despite confining to normal patterns. Thus, we propose a novel graph-based trajectory representation and association scheme for extraction and confederation of traffic movement patterns, such that data patterns and uncertainty can be learned by deep learning (DL) models. This paper proposes the usage of a recurrent neural network (RNN)-based evidential regression model, which can predict trajectory at future timesteps as well as estimate the data and model uncertainties associated, to detect anomalous maritime trajectories, such as unusual vessel maneuvering, using automatic identification system (AIS) data. Furthermore, we utilize evidential deep learning classifiers to detect unusual turns of vessels and the loss of transmitted signal using predicted class probabilities with associated uncertainties. Our experimental results suggest that the graphical representation of traffic patterns improves the ability of the DL models, such as evidential and Monte Carlo dropout, to learn the temporal-spatial correlation of data and associated uncertainties. Using different datasets and experiments, we demonstrate that the estimated prediction uncertainty yields fundamental information for the detection of traffic anomalies in the maritime and, possibly in other domains.","Monte Carlo methods,classification,recurrent neural nets,graph,deep learning (artificial intelligence),Anomaly detection,DL models,graph-based trajectory representation,automatic identification system data,Monte Carlo dropout,graphical representation,traffic movement patterns,detect anomalous maritime trajectories,Predictive models,regression analysis,evidential deep learning,marine engineering,Data models,data patterns,pattern classification,Artificial intelligence,graph theory,RNN,regression,clustering,uncertainty,Trajectory,Uncertainty,probability,Computational modeling,traffic engineering computing,recurrent neural network-based evidential regression model,deep learning uncertainties,AIS data,"
"a novel hybrid approach for detecting abnormal vessel behavior in maritime traffic","2023","The Abnormal Behavior Detection of Vessels (ABVD) is crucial for enhancing Vesselsâ€™ situational awareness as well as achieving effective management of maritime traffic. Clustering algorithms are extensively employed for ABVD tasks, however, they are not only time-consuming but also frequently inaccurate when dealing with complex and dynamic vessel trajectory detection tasks. To address the above problems, we propose a novel hybrid approach, CSDLSTM(Course/Speed-DBSCAN and LSTM), which combines Density-based Clustering(DBSCAN) and long short-term memory networks to improve the efficiency of ABVD. Specifically, a three-dimensional CS-DBSCAN (Course/Speed-DBSCAN) algorithm is proposed, which incorporates speed and course features along with geospatial information in the clustering process to accurately describe vessel behavior. In addition, the clustering results are used as traffic patterns to train the LSTM predictor for real-time maritime anomaly detection. Experiments conducted on real AIS datasets demonstrate that the CSD-LSTM method has greater precision and efficiency in ABVD.","Traffic control,Transportation,Clustering algorithms,LSTM,Prediction algorithms,CS-DBSCAN,Sensitivity,Real-time systems,Heuristic algorithms,abnormal vessel behavior,"
"technologies to aid decision making for maritime security","2012","The paper presents 3 key technologies used in an integrated maritime reasoning and monitoring system [1]. These technologies fuse maritime data for decision support in the martime security domain. They support monitoring of scenarios of interest such as terrorist attacks or piracy incidents, and alert operators when such scenarios are assessed likely to happen. These 3 technologies are: a. Dynamic Bayesian Reasoning & Advanced Intelligent Networks (D'Brain), a reasoning system based on Bayesian networks. Causal and probabilistic information about scenarios of interest are structured as Bayesian networks, in which variables are set according to the interpretation of incoming situation information. The system thus provides a systematic approach to modelling and monitoring for scenarios of interest in the maritime situation. b. Graylist Ranking, a ranking technique to order entities based on their structural relationship with black-listed entities. The ranked list of entities could then be used to prioritize further investigation efforts into higher ranking entities which are considered more suspicious. c. Trajectory Analysis using a nonparametric Bayesian model, Dual Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes (Dual-HDP) [2]. It models the activity patterns (norm) of entities in motion.

"loitering behavior detection and classification of vessel movements based on trajectory shape and convolutional neural networks","2022","To improve the ability of ship behavior detection in maritime safety surveillance, a new ship behavior of frequent turning within a certain spatial range, called ship loitering, was found under the ship behavior framework of 'anchored-off, straight-sailing, turning'. The concept of trajectory redundancy is defined as the quantitative representation of trajectory characteristics of ship loitering. A multi-scale sliding window-based ship loitering detection method is designed to process ship trajectories with different spatial ranges and time duration. Further, a shape recognition model based on a convolutional neural network is constructed and trained to identify four typical shapes of loitering trajectories. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, experiments were conducted using the AIS trajectory data collected from the sea off the Strait of Juan de Fuca in the eastern North Pacific Ocean in 2017 and validated against the manual labeling results. The results illustrate that six general categories of ships produce loitering behaviors with different intentions. The characteristics of the spatial-temporal distribution of ship loitering behaviors can be represented as different shapes. The average precision of ship loitering detection reaches 96.5% and the average accuracy of four typical loitering trajectory shapes reaches 86.2%.","Convolutional neural network (CNN),Loitering behavior,Ship trajectory,Automatic identification system (AIS),Sliding window,"

"development of denoising and compression algorithms for ais-based vessel trajectories","2022","Ship navigation information derived from the Automatic Identification System (AIS) is widely used in the shipping industry. As AIS reports are featured with huge volume and noises, preprocessing of AIS data is essential before its further application. This study aims to develop effective algorithms to denoise and compress raw trajectories derived from AIS reports. Specifically, an effective noise detection method based on statistical theory and sliding window is first proposed to identify glitches in a given trajectory. Linear interpolation is further used to rectify the glitches detected. Then, two modes of algorithms are proposed for trajectory compression: static mode with preset threshold for compression and dynamic mode considering the distance between trajectory points and the coastline in a real-time manner. Numerical experiments show that the noise detection and rectification algorithms and the trajectory compression algorithms are accurate and highly efficient considering compression rate, information loss, and computation time. The main innovation of this research includes developing an accurate and robust trajectory glitch detection and rectification algorithm, proposing two modes of trajectory compression algorithms, and combining the two tasks in a holistic robust framework. Especially, the dynamic compression mode can overcome a major problem encountered in static compression where the compressed trajectories may go across land. It can also deal with more flexible compression requirements and thus should be more applicable in practice.","Trajectory denoising,Trajectory compression,Automatic identification system (AIS),Trajectory point-coastline distance,Dynamic threshold,"
