"working to rule, or working safely? part 1: a state of the art review","2013","The paper reviews the literature from 1986 on the management of those safety rules and procedures which relate to the workplace level in organisations. It contrasts two different paradigms of how rules and their development and use are perceived and managed. The first is a top-down classical, rational approach in which rules are seen as static, comprehensive limits of freedom of choice, imposed on operators at the sharp end and violations are seen as negative behaviour to be suppressed. The second is a bottom-up constructivist view of rules as dynamic, local, situated constructions of operators as experts, where competence is seen to a great extent as the ability to adapt rules to the diversity of reality. The paper explores the research underlying and illustrating these two paradigms, drawn from psychology, sociology and ethnography, organisational studies and behavioural economics. In a separate paper following on from this review (Hale and Borys, this issue) the authors propose a framework of rule management which attempts to draw the lessons from both paradigms. It places the monitoring and adaptation of rules central to its management process.","Safety procedures,Management of rules,Safety rules,"
"evaluation of the effectiveness of co-processors gpu-based in solving of generating sea waves in the operation simulation model of unmanned maritime vehicles","2023","The article considers the matters of developing the models of the bottom sonar survey applying unmanned surface vehicles. The purpose of the work is the assessment of the efficiency of applying available firmware means to conduct computer-intense calculations when using simulation model. Within the work, the main attention was paid to considering the process of forming the sea surface at various parameters of the environment as one of the most resource-intense in the simulation model from the point of view of computation efforts. It is shown that the whole process of the sea surface forming can be kept to the determined stages. The result of the process of forming is a map of the surface peaks. The sea surface forming process can be performed both in sequential and parallel form, whereat some computing blocks can be performed with use of distributed systems. The work has carried out the estimation of the calculation time in implementing the sequential process on the general-purpose processing units of architecture x86 applying OpenCV library, and also of the parallel process applying Nvidia graphics processing units supported by the CUDA technology. The computational experiments conducted for various general-purpose processing units and graphic processors issued during the period from 2010 to 2021 has shown that the use of graphic computing units allows increasing the speed of performing the stage of the complex values of frequencies amplitudes by 20 times, while in performing the stage of an inverse Fourier transform the speed is increased 3 times at average.","CUDA,Fourier transform,Sea surface,sonar systems,Computational modeling,Atmospheric modeling,unmanned maritime vehicles,Surveys,sea surface,Industries,Surface waves,Graphics,"
"ship anti-grounding with a maritime autonomous surface ship and digital twin of port of hamburg","2023","We present the virtual demonstration of a novel ship Anti-Grounding Service in a digital twinned use case scenario in the Port of Hamburg. The scenario is generated from real bathymetry survey data collected in the Port. The virtual model of a Maritime Autonomous Surface Ship travels the route ahead of merchant ships on approach to the Port and is integrated with a real-time high-resolution Multibeam SONAR Simulator that synthesizes underkeel survey data. The automated data processing workflow detects potential grounding hazards in the synthetic survey data and provides a real-time update of the Port nautical chart, which is presented in the Electronic Chart Display and Information System of a Ship Handling Simulator. Our method is the first to consider Multibeam SONAR equipped Maritime Autonomous Surface Ship platforms for provision of ship Anti-Grounding Services. The results validate the full-scale simulation and automated hazard detection workflow and incorporate tests conducted with certified mariners (N=10) to address human factors of introducing new technologies into safety critical situations. The key contributions of this work are summarized as: 1) Validation of Maritime Autonomous Surface Ships as an Anti-Grounding Service delivery platform; 2) Demonstration of a Digital Twin for hydrography survey and bottom hazard detection; and 3) Experimental validation with certified mariners of the anti-grounding service Human-Computer Interface on the ship bridge.","digital twinned use case scenario,automated data processing workflow,ship antigrounding service,underkeel survey data,electronic chart display,Bridges,human factors,bathymetry survey data,safety,grounding hazards,antigrounding service delivery platform,hydrography,Surveys,digital twins,ships,marine safety,maritime autonomous surface ship platforms,autonomous,port nautical chart,synthetic survey data,Seaports,object detection,automated hazard detection workflow,simulation,digital twin,ship handling simulator,sonar,unmanned vehicle,Autonomous aerial vehicles,bathymetry,Real-time systems,antigrounding service human-computer interface,real-time high-resolution multibeam SONAR simulator,merchant ship,Hazards,hazards,Hamburg port,SONAR,ports,navigation,Digital twins,merchant ships,oceanographic techniques,ship bridge,"
"feature disentanglement learning model for ocean temperature field forecast","2023","With the development of sensor technology, data-driven modeling methods for physical oceanography have boomed. Existing deep learning studies lack interpretability from the physical mechanisms. This paper proposes a novel feature disentanglement learning model for the ocean temperature field forecast. In this method, feature disentanglement is adopted to decompose the high-dimensional measured temperature information based on Tucker decomposition. The extracted dynamic feature is filtered and predicted by incremental dynamic learning, and the incremental data information is balanced by maximizing the Gaussian likelihood. Then, the dynamic feature can be entangled with the stable features to predict the ocean temperature field. Last, incremental residual learning can compensate for the feature disentanglement learning error. Experiments on the temperature dataset of the Western Pacific have verified that the proposed method is superior to the existing baselines.","Residual learning,Partial differential equation,Physical oceanography,Feature disentanglement,Incremental learning,"
"cyber risk perception in the maritime domain: a systematic literature review","2021","This paper aims to present an approach to investigate cyber risk perception with use of recognized psychological models, and to give an overview of state-of-the-art research within the field of cyber risk perception in general and in the context of the maritime domain. The focus will be on determinative dimensions within the psychometric paradigm and cognitive biases, and to give recommendations on further research within these fields. Okoli and Schabramâ€™s eight-step guide to plan, select, extract, and execute a systematic literature review is used as guidance. The search process resulted in 25 relevant articles which describes 24 dimensions of cyber risk perception in different online environments. Research within the area of maritime cyber security is increasing, however, no studies relevant for our literature review were found within the maritime domain. The nine dimensions in the psychometric model, perceived benefit and the optimistic bias is presented and discussed in a maritime context. Cyber risk perception is a complex research-area where both determinative factors and other cognitive processes can be influenced by each other. This can indicate that the dimensions differ across populations and professions, creating grounds for why context-specific studies are important. Further research may benefit from more multidisciplinary, descriptive, and inductive approaches, and contextual studies within maritime cyber risk perception can contribute to develop targeted tools for risk mitigation to enhance safety at sea.","risk perception,Safety,online environments,systematic literature review,maritime cyber risk perception,human behavior,security of data,human factors,psychology,Cyberspace,cognition,search process,Bibliographies,marine safety,psychological models,marine engineering,cognitive biases,project management,Computer crime,cognitive processes,maritime cyber security,cyberpsychology,risk analysis,Psychology,psychometric paradigm,Maritime cyber security,Tools,risk communication,Systematics,"
"graph representation learning with encoding edges","2019","Network embedding aims at learning the low dimensional representation of nodes. These representations can be widely used for network mining tasks, such as link prediction, anomaly detection, and classification. Recently, a great deal of meaningful research work has been carried out on this emerging network analysis paradigm. The real-world network contains different size clusters because of the edges with different relationship types. These clusters also reflect some features of nodes, which can contribute to the optimization of the feature representation of nodes. However, existing network embedding methods do not distinguish these relationship types. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised network representation learning model that can encode edge relationship information. Firstly, an objective function is defined, which can learn the edge vectors by implicit clustering. Then, a biased random walk is designed to generate a series of node sequences, which are put into Skip-Gram to learn the low dimensional node representations. Extensive experiments are conducted on several network datasets. Compared with the state-of-art baselines, the proposed method is able to achieve favorable and stable results in multi-label classification and link prediction tasks.","Edge representation,Feature learning,Network mining,Network embedding,"
"diagnosis of a high-impact secondary cyclone during hymex-sop1 iop18","2020","Multiple high-impact weather events occurred during HyMeX-SOP1, which was intensively monitored by a large number of ordinary and extraordinary observations. The availability of special observations offers an unprecedented opportunity to explore these events in depth and assess the capabilities of current numerical weather prediction tools. In this case, a small-scale secondary cyclone formed within a prominent cyclone that intensified in the north-western part of the western Mediterranean during IOP18 on October 31, 2012. The small secondary system formed near Catalonia, where heavy rain was observed, and then moved to the northern part of the island of Minorca, producing very strong winds. Finally, the secondary cyclone moved northeast while merging with the main cyclone and evolving as a cyclonic perturbation towards the Gulf of Genoa, bringing heavy precipitation to some Italian regions. This work aims at providing a detailed diagnosis of the genesis and evolution of the secondary cyclone, using high-resolution numerical tools. Furthermore, with the main objective of identifying the main physical mechanisms involved in the genesis and evolution of the small-scale secondary cyclone, sensitivity experiments were performed taking into account three main factors: latent heat release, upper-level dynamical forcing and topographical effects. Results show that in terms of individual cyclogenetic contributions, the upper level PV anomaly contribution dominated the initial phase and the diabatic heating from condensation contributed to the further deepening during the later stages of the secondary cyclone. The initial dynamical effect from the upper-levels forcing was amplified by the local topographic features, becoming a key synergistic factor for the formation of the damaging secondary cyclonic system.","Secondary cyclone,Mediterranean,High-impact event,HyMeX,Factor separation,Potential vorticity inversion,"
"an ecosystem-based approach to evaluate the ecological quality of mediterranean undersea caves","2015","A theoretical model of structure and functioning was constructed for the Mediterranean undersea cave ecosystem. This model integrates almost all representative components of the cave ecosystem and gives an idea of their faunal compositions, characteristics and related interactions. This model constitutes the basis of the Ecosystem-Based Quality Index (EBQI) of the European Union's Marine Strategy Framework Directive, which aims at evaluating the ecological quality of an ecosystem. It is based on four crucial complementary elements: (i) each component was weighted in accordance with its importance in determining the structure and functioning of the cave ecosystem; (ii) a suite of relevant parameters were defined to assess the ecological state of each component of the cave ecosystem; (iii) these parameters were aggregated into one relevant index, the Cave EBQI (CavEBQI), to summarize the quality evaluation for each cave site; (iv) each value of ecological state is accompanied by a Confidence Index as a measure of its reliability. The CavEBQI was used on 22 Mediterranean undersea caves of France and Italy. Disparities of ecological quality were found among caves but most of them ranged from moderate to high ecological quality. For some caves, no conclusion can be drawn when our method predicts a poor reliability of the evaluation of their ecological quality. This ecosystem-based evaluation of the quality of undersea caves seems to be a powerful tool, with the advantage of being based on almost all its components, rather than just on a few species. It is accompanied by a measure of its reliability, hence it provides a reliable idea of the ecological state of the entire ecosystem at each cave site. Monitoring the ecological state of caves and the effects of disturbances over large geographic and temporal scales is made possible with CavEBQI. Applying the same method to other ecosystems, can provide an integrated view of a marine region, which is essential when addressing questions about protection, conservation and restoration.","Mediterranean Sea,Ecological quality,Marine Strategy Framework Directive,Underwater marine caves,Undersea caves,Ecosystem-based quality index,"
"tightly coupled, graph-based dvl/imu fusion and decoupled mapping for slam-centric maritime infrastructure inspection","2023","In this article, we address the problem of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM)-centric maritime infrastructure inspection [using unmanned surface vehicles (USVs)] via novel approaches in tightly-coupled, graph-based DVL/IMU fusion and decoupled mapping. As our first contribution, we formalize the preintegration of linear velocity measurements, obtained by a Doppler velocity log (DVL), in combination with angular velocity measurements, obtained by an inertial measurement unit (IMU), as binary factors encoding relative position. To evaluate state estimation improvements imparted by DVL/IMU fusion, we implement our proposed factor within a state-of-the-art, graph-based lidar-visual-inertial (LVI) SLAM system as our second contribution. Accuracy and robustness improvements are demonstrated in simulation by comparing maximum a posteriori pose estimates with and without DVL/IMU fusion against ground truth poses. As our third contribution, we propose a map generation framework for downstream inspection applications decoupled from SLAM. In our framework, volumetric data (captured by sonar, lidar, etc.) is transformed into a common world coordinate frame using extrinsic calibrations and SLAM pose estimates as input. Our framework operates over the complete set of raw volumetric data, whereas SLAM systems (both online and offline) typically operate over a subset of down-sampled volumetric data. To address the processing of additional volumetric data, we present innovations in refined pose correction and staged filtering for user-controlled denoising. We experimentally evaluate our map generation framework against the LVI SLAM system adopted for this study using real-world data and demonstrate improvements to map quality metrics important to inspection.","decoupled mapping,sensor fusion,Inspection,robot vision,unmanned surface vehicles (USVs),SLAM (robots),LVI SLAM system,Sea measurements,Laser radar,Doppler velocity log,SLAM systems,inspection,pose estimation,Simultaneous localization and mapping,angular velocity measurements,inertial measurement unit,graph-based lidar-visual-inertial SLAM system,state estimation,map generation framework,SLAM-centric maritime infrastructure inspection,mapping,Sonar,optical radar,Robustness,map quality metrics,state estimation improvements,unmanned surface vehicles,calibration,Velocity measurement,mobile robots,downstream inspection applications,linear velocity measurements,simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM),velocity measurement,"

"an intelligent maritime scene frame prediction based on digital twins technology","2021","This paper proposes a scene frame prediction system based on digital twin technology. The system is mainly composed of an unmanned perception module, a communication link module, a command center module that provides intelligent computing services, and an interaction and visualization module for human operators. These modules together constitute a system for predicting and recovery the time-series matrix composed of scene frames and object frames. At the same time, in view of the current problems of lack of real-time information and long response time in the maritime search and rescue (SAR) field, this paper instantiates the above system to improve the existing SAR system. Satellites and unmanned vehicles perceive part of the scene data of the real cyber-physical system in real-time and divide them into multiple frames according to the timestamps. In addition, this paper also proposes an environmental graph-attention network (Env-GAT) to achieve efficient and reliable frame predicting. Finally, this paper verifies that the performance of the spatiotemporal attention graph network model has reached the optimal level through computational experiments.","Satellites,Digital twins technology,emergency management,Unmanned vehicles,human computer interaction,Conferences,cyber-physical systems,data visualisation,Search problems,maritime SAR,maritime search and rescue,Graph attention,command center module,Spatial-temporal trajectory prediction,communication link module,time-series matrix,marine engineering,digital twins technology,Maritime SAR,visualization module,human operators,environmental graph-attention network,neural net architecture,unmanned vehicles,Real-time systems,time series,satellites,Digital twin,Scene frame prediction system,Trajectory,intelligent maritime scene frame prediction,intelligent computing services,cyber-physical system,"
"geochemical, mineralogical, and petrological characteristics of the cretaceous coal from the middle benue trough basin, nigeria: implication for coal depositional environments","2022","The Benue Trough Basin (BTB) of Nigeria is geologically and geo-morphologically subdivided into upper, middle, and lower segments. The BTB is the subject of geological research due to its rich coal deposits that have the potential for oil and gas. The purpose of the present study is to examine the origins, depositional environments, and thermal history of the selected coals and the processes that influence their quality. Coal samples from different open cast coal mines in the middle BTB were examined using proximate and ultimate, x-ray diffraction (XRD), x-ray fluorescence (XRF), laser ablation induced coupled plasma (LA-ICPMS), and petrographical analyses. The coal samples contained mainly quartz, kaolinite, and organic carbon. The XRD spectra peaks revealed the triclinic and monoclinic structure of kaolin. The SiO2/Al2O3 ratios confirmed the dominance of quartz and kaolinite. The Ni/Co versus V/Cr, Cu/Zn, and V/Mo values in the studied coals suggest oxic depositional environments, whereas the V/(Ni + V) and V/(V + Cr) values indicate oxic to suboxic conditions. The Ce/Ce∗ values are slightly below 1, which indicates a suboxic depositional environment. Maceral texture is indicative of transformations from sub-bituminous to high volatile C or B bituminous coal. The maceral components and mineral matter (≥10%) of the studied coals imply deposition in the planar margin mire, and a river system of planar margin mire environments, respectively. The high gelification index (GI) and tissue preservation index (TPI) values indicate peat accumulation developed within a wet forest swamp. The ternary diagram of the maceral component suggests deposition in a wet moor environment with intermittent moderate to high flooding episodes. The studied coals are sub-hydrous vitrinite inferring hydrogen-poor and thermally immature characteristics. The low V and Ni contents, low H/C and high O/C, indicate Type Ⅲ terrestrial organic matter with the potential to generate gaseous hydrocarbons. The investigated coals were deposited by the river within telmatic, limnic, and limno-telmatic zones in the planar margin mire depositional environments. Overall, the integrated petrologic and geochemical data used in this study provides a reliable approach for the assessment of coal depositional environments.","Mineralogy,Coal,Depositional environments,Maceral,Trace elements,"
"long-range dependence in north atlantic sea level","2006","Sea level is an important parameter in climate and oceanographic applications. In this work the scaling behavior of sea level is analyzed from time series of sea level observations. The wavelet domain is particularly attractive for the identification of scaling behavior in an observed time series. The wavelet spectrum from a scale-by-scale wavelet analysis of variance reproduces in the wavelet domain the power laws underlying a scaling process, allowing the estimation of the scaling exponent from the slope of the wavelet spectrum. Here the scaling exponent is estimated in the wavelet domain for time series of sea level observations in the North Atlantic: at coastal sites from tide gauges, covering 50 years of monthly measurements, and in the open ocean from satellite altimetry, covering 12 years of satellite measurements at 10 days intervals. Both tide gauge and altimetry time series exhibit scaling behavior. Furthermore, the degree of stochastic persistence is spatially coherent and distinct at the coast and in the open ocean. Near the coast, the stochastic structure of the sea level observations is characterized by long-range dependence with a moderate degree of persistence. Larger values of the scaling exponent, consistent with weaker persistence, are concentrated in the northern Atlantic. At mid-latitudes the stochastic dependence of sea level observations is characterized by strong persistence in the form of strong long-range and 1/f dependence.","Scaling,North Atlantic,Sea level,Wavelet methods,"
"early mesozoic lamproites and monzonitoids of southeastern gorny altai: geochemistry, sr-nd isotope composition, and sources of melts","2015","Small intrusions of lamprophyres and lamproites (Chuya complex) and K-monzonitoids (Tarkhata and Terandzhik complexes) are widespread in southeastern Gorny Altai. Geochronological (U-Pb and Ar-Ar) isotope studies show their formation in the Early-Middle Triassic (~234-250 Ma). Lamproites have been revealed within two magmatic areas and correspond in geochemical parameters to the classical Mediterranean and Tibet orogenic lamproites. According to isotope data ((87Sr/86Sr)T = 0.70850-0.70891, (143Nd/144Nd)T = 0.512157-0.512196, 206Pb/204Pb = 17.95-18.05) and Th/La and Sm/La values, the Chuya lamproites and lamprophyres melted out from the enriched lithospheric mantle with the participation of DM, EM1, EM2, and SALATHO. The monzonitoid series of the Tarkhata and Terandzhik complexes are similar in petrographic and geochemical compositions but differ significantly in Sr-Nd isotope composition: The Tarkhata monzonitoids are close to the Chuya lamproites, whereas the Terandzhik ones show a higher portion of DM ((87Sr/86Sr)T = 0.70434-0.70497, (143Nd/144Nd)T = 0.512463-0.512487) in their source, which suggests its shallower depth of occurrence and the higher degree of its partial melting as compared with the derivates of the Chuya and Tarkhata complexes.

"the utility of body size indices derived from optical plankton counter data for the characterization of marine zooplankton assemblages","2012","To evaluate the utility of size-based indices derived from an Optical Plankton Counter (OPC) through detection of spatial and temporal trends in zooplankton biomass, zooplankton size data were collected with an OPC across the Scotian Shelf region of the northwest Atlantic Ocean in April and October of 1997, 1998, and 1999. Eight size-based indices were computed – three simple size metrics (arithmetic mean, geometric mean, coefficient of variation) and metrics derived from the Normalized Biomass Size Spectrum (NBSS; X- and Y-coordinates and curvature of a fitted quadratic function) and the Pareto distribution (Y-intercept and slope). Results indicate that the simple size indices and those derived from the Pareto distribution consistently accounted for the greatest portion of annual variation in zooplankton biomass whereas indices derived from the NBSS accounted only for some secondary patterns. Simple indices also accounted for the greatest portion of spatial variance in zooplankton biomass whereas the NBSS and Pareto accounted for secondary patterns. Patterns in zooplankton communities based on these indices reflected broad taxonomic trends and were related to independent observations on atmospheric and hydrographic conditions in the study area. Size-based zooplankton data from continuous survey instruments can provide powerful adjuncts to both freshwater and marine aquatic monitoring.","Pareto distribution,Optical Plankton Counter,Zooplankton,Body-size index,Scotian Shelf,Size spectrum,"
"an experimental investigation on damage mechanisms of thick hybrid composite structures under flexural loading using multi-instrument measurements","2021","In this study, damage characterization of thick carbon/glass fiber reinforced hybrid composites is performed under flexural loading conditions via two non-destructive evaluation (NDE) techniques, i.e., digital image correlation (DIC) and acoustic emission (AE). Experimental results demonstrate that the flexural modulus of the hybrid composites is strongly correlated with the location of carbon fiber plies; the closer these plies are to the laminate faces, the higher is the modulus. On the other hand, the flexural strength depends on the type and extent of damage initiation in the laminates. Interply hybridization of carbon fiber reinforced composites (CFRPs) with glass fiber not only improves their flexural strength and failure strain but also facilitates failure predictability in CFRPs. The transverse and shear strains associated with various failure modes in thick hybrid laminates are efficiently captured by the DIC technique. In addition, AE results reveal that the strain levels associated with the onset of acoustic activity are linked to failure in the carbon fiber plies of the hybrid laminates. Furthermore, these observations made by DIC and AE on thick hybrid laminates are confirmed with optical fractography. Finally, it is revealed that ply lay-up sequence and laminate thickness notably alter both the mechanical performance and damage mechanisms of hybrid composites.","Damage accumulation,Flexural properties,Digital image correlation,Failure predictability,Thick hybrid composites,Acoustic emission,"
"the 2016 red tide crisis in southern chile: possible influence of the mass oceanic dumping of dead salmons","2020","In 2016, a massive harmful algal bloom (HAB) of Alexandrium catenella around Chiloé island caused one of the major socio-ecological crisis in Chilean history. This red tide occurred in two distinct pulses, the second, most anomalous, bursting with extreme toxicity on the Pacific coast, weeks after the highly controversial dumping off Chiloé of 4,700 t of rotting salmons, killed by a previous HAB of Pseudochattonella verruculosa. We study the transport of this pollution, analyzing the physical oceanographic conditions during and after the dumping. We find that a cyclonic gyre was present between the dumping site and the coast, visible in satellite altimetry and sea surface temperature data. Using Lagrangian simulations, we confirm that near-surface currents could have brought part of the pollution to the coast, and fueled the bloom. This scenario explains also the anomalous later finding of ammonium near Chiloé. Finally we discuss the mismanagement of risk throughout the events.","Aquaculture,Ocean transport,Ecological crisis,Risk management,Pollution control,Harmful algal blooms,"
"turia river delta and coastal barrier-lagoon of valencia (mediterranean coast of spain): geomorphological processes and global climate fluctuations since iberian-roman times","2019","Extensive drillings and 31 new C-14 datings were used to establish the geomorphological evolution of the Turia river delta and coastal barrier-lagoon system of Valencia (Spain) over the last three millennia. Integration of geomorphological, stratigraphic, malacological, sedimentological and geoarchaeological data enables us to relate river Turia avulsions and alluvial episodes to the development of coastal spits and barriers. Geomorphological changes in the study area may also be associated with global climate events, sea-level fluctuations or anthropogenic periods in the Turia catchment. Six phases may be differentiated: (1) a major early alluviation phase during the Iberian period, when the Turia river ran to the north of the coastal plain and sand spits closed the Valencia open lagoon environments, forming a permeable barrier (2800 BP to 2300 BP approximately); (2) an avulsion phase of the Turia river to the south at the end of the Roman period (4th century AD); (3) formation of a more advanced spit just behind the most recent barrier during the Late Antique Little Ice Age (LALIA, Visigothic period); (4) a flood period of high-magnitude with coarser sediments throughout the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA, 11th century AD), when La Punta meridional deltaic ridge developed, which can be related to beach ridge closing and marine isolation of the Valencia lagoon around the 12th century; (5) important river alluviation and growth of the recent coastal barrier favoured by Turia channel changes during the Middle Ages, in the early Little Ice Age (LIA); (6) rapid coastal progradation and decline in salinity in the Valencia lagoon between the Maunder sunspot minimum (MM) and the end of LIA.","River avulsions,Western Europe,Mediterranean,Coastal geomorphology,Holocene,Paleoclimatology,"
"heat, salt and volume transports by eddies in the vicinity of the luzon strait","2012","The heat, salt and volume transports by oceanic meso-scale eddies generated near the Luzon Strait and moving into the South China Sea (SCS) are estimated by combining satellite altimetry and sea surface temperature (SST) data with hydrographic data. By establishing a statistical relationship among steric height, SST and subsurface temperature, together with a multi-grid 3D-Var assimilation method, an eddy-resolving temperature/salinity dataset from 1993 to 2008 is reconstructed from the altimetry sea surface height (SSH) anomaly, remote sensing SST and historical temperature/salinity profiles in the SCS. Using two cases of eddies in the reconstructed temperature/salinity dataset, we show that a cyclonic eddy can carry negative heat anomaly with −6.7±2.5×1018J, which contributes to the heat balance of the region where it travels through, and freshwater of 0.0005±0.0002Sv into the SCS, and that an anti-cyclonic eddy can transport positive heat anomaly with 4.6±1.8×1018J, which might have affected the inteannual variation of heat in the upper layer of the SCS and bring freshwater of 0.0004±0.0001Sv into the SCS on top of the 26.5σθ isopycnal surface. The 16-year averaged heat, salt and volume transports by meso-scale eddies near the Luzon Strait are estimated as 0.00003±0.00001PW, 0.004±0.001×106kgs−1 and 0.3Sv into the SCS on top of the 25.0σθ isopycnal surface. During the 16-year period, these transports show significant interannual variations. Generally, the heat transport is positive during summers of El Niño, while it is negative or weakly positive during summers of La Niña.","Kuroshio intrusion,Luzon Strait,Meso-scale eddy,Data assimilation,Heat transport,"

"chemostratigraphy: a method to improve interwell correlation in barren sequences — a case study using onshore duckmantian/stephanian sequences (west midlands, u.k.)","1999","Chemostratigraphy has been applied to onshore Duckmantian/Stephanian successions encountered in outcrop and penetrated by two boreholes from the West Midlands (U.K.). These successions represent the onshore equivalents of the `Barren Red Measures' which are important hydrocarbon-bearing sequences in the Southern North Sea. Much is known about the onshore successions in terms of sedimentology, mineralogy and provenance and thus they provide the ideal test for the validity of chemostratigraphy as a stratigraphic tool. Reliable inorganic geochemical data have been acquired from geochemical analyses of core, sidewall core and cuttings samples, with 19 elements being determined. Stratigraphic variations in elemental concentrations are compared with known variations in the mineralogical data. The established lithostratigraphic units of the Duckmantian/Stephanian intervals can also be recognized from the geochemical data and by using these data can be subdivided further. This results in an independent chemostratigraphic correlation being established for the two boreholes, which has been assessed statistically by discriminant function analysis. From the geochemical and mineralogical data, distinct changes in provenance are identified within the Upper Carboniferous successions. The sediments of the Coal Measures were derived from a north westerly and westerly source (?Caledonian), whereas the Etruria Formation sediments came from the Wales Brabant Massif, the sediments having mixed Caledonian and Cadomian characteristics. Eventually these sediments were replaced by sediments from a southern Hercynian source (Halesowen and Salop Formations).","chemostratigraphy,Upper Carboniferous,correlation,provenance,"
"reconstructing holocene shore displacement and stone age palaeogeography from a foredune sequence on ruhnu island, gulf of riga, baltic sea","2018","Holocene shore displacement and the palaeogeography of Late Mesolithic and Late Neolithic settlements on Ruhnu Island, Gulf of Riga, were reconstructed using foredune sequence luminescence dating, sedimentological data supported by ground-penetrating radar analysis, and GIS-based landscape modelling. The foredune ridges consist of very well to well sorted fine- to medium-grained aeolian sand and are underlain by seaward dipping foreshore sediments. The studied sequence of 38 ridges was formed between 6.91±0.58ka and 2.54±0.19ka ago, and represents a period of falling relative sea level. Foredune plain progradation, with average rates of 0.3–0.6m per year, was controlled by isostatic land uplift, which caused a continuous withdrawal of shorelines to lower elevations. The dated foredune succession was used to reconstruct the coastal palaeogeography of the island. Palaeogeographical reconstructions show that during two phases of Late Mesolithic habitation, at ca. 7.2cal.ka BP and 6.2cal.ka BP, seal hunters settled the coastal zone of Ruhnu Island. Based on tool material and pottery type they could have originated from Saaremaa Island, which according to palaeoreconstruction of the Gulf of Riga, was located approximately 70km northwest of Ruhnu Island during the Late Mesolithic. Later signs of human occupation, radiocarbon dated to ca. 4.7cal.ka BP, were from the centre of the island, hundreds of metres away from the shore at about 8m above its contemporary sea level. This Late Neolithic habitation shows a clearly different pattern than earlier coastal settlement, and suggests a shift in subsistence strategy towards agriculture and animal husbandry.","Foredune,Stone Age settlement,Luminescence dating,Palaeogeography,Baltic Sea,Sea level changes,Beach ridges,"
"probability elicitation for bayesian networks to distinguish between intentional attacks and accidental technical failures","2023","Both intentional attacks and accidental technical failures can lead to abnormal behaviour in components of industrial control systems. In our previous work, we developed a framework for constructing Bayesian Network (BN) models to enable operators to distinguish between those two classes, including knowledge elicitation to construct the directed acyclic graph of BN models. In this paper, we add a systematic method for knowledge elicitation to construct the Conditional Probability Tables (CPTs) of BN models, thereby completing a holistic framework to distinguish between attacks and technical failures. In order to elicit reliable probabilities from experts, we need to reduce the workload of experts in probability elicitation by reducing the number of conditional probabilities to elicit and facilitating individual probability entry. We utilise DeMorgan models to reduce the number of conditional probabilities to elicit as they are suitable for modelling opposing influences i.e., combinations of influences that promote and inhibit the child event. To facilitate individual probability entry, we use probability scales with numerical and verbal anchors.

"a molecular dynamics approach for modeling the geographical distribution of ship collision risk","2020","Collision is one of the major accidents that put the safety of navigation at risk all the time. The effective monitoring on the geographical distribution of collision risk is conducive to reducing the chance of collision accidents. In this paper, a novel model intended for identifying the geographical distribution of collision risk in water area was proposed on the basis of radial distribution function in molecular dynamics. In this model, ship traffic and ships were converted into a molecular system. After being obtained using an analytical method, collision risk was generalized as distance to model the collision risk by radial distribution function. Finally, a space interpolation technique was applied to visualize the geographical distribution of collision risk. To validate the proposed model, the AIS data contained in Bohai Strait was used to conduct experiment. According to the experimental results, the map as obtained by the proposed model is capable to identify the geographical distribution of collision risk, and is advantageous over the traditional method in the instantaneity and accuracy of identification. Moreover, the proposed model can assist surveillance operators in the monitoring of collision risk and the improvement of work efficiency, thus enhancing the navigational safety in the water area.","Geographical distribution,AIS data,Radial distribution function,Collision risk,"

"jurassic-recent stratigraphy, structure, and hydrocarbon potential of the mesozoic-cenozoic rifted-passive margin of the tarfaya-dakhla basin of southern morocco","2022","We describe the structure, stratigraphy, and hydrocarbon potential of the 1000-km-long Tarfaya-Dakhla Basin (TDB) along the Atlantic rifted-passive margin of Morocco. Our dataset consists of a 4885-line km grid of depth-converted industry seismic data tied to three DSDP wells in the deepwater area and exploratory wells on the slope and shelf. Based on mapping of this seismic grid, the tectonostratigraphic events that have affected this margin include: 1) a Late Triassic-Early Jurassic rift phase that separated the Moroccan margin from its conjugate margin in eastern Canada began during the Late Triassic-Early Jurassic; 2) early passive margin sedimentation consists of Middle Jurassic-Early Cretaceous passive margin phase consisting of a massive, 14-km-thick, reefal-carbonate platform formed above the rifted margin during the Early Jurassic and was subsequently buried by the 6-km-thick, Early Cretaceous (Berriasian) Boujdour deltaic complex. During this period continued high rates of clastic sedimentation resulted in margin steepening and gravitational collapse during the Valanginian and formed a 480-km-long and 68-km-wide passive margin fold belt characterized by a zone of updip normal faults of 480 km in length and 30 km in width and a zone of downdip folds and thrusts of 117 km in length and 15 km in width. Geochemical data from DSDP 397 and 369 wells and two pseudo-wells were used to evaluate source rock potential and hydrocarbon prospectivity of the Jurassic to Recent section. Basin modeling reveals that the Jurassic source rocks known from DSDP drilling are presently overmature in the study area with hydrocarbon generation beginning in the Upper Jurassic-Lower Cretaceous. The Lower Cretaceous source rocks are immature except for localized areas, and the Upper Cretaceous is immature across the study area.","Basin modeling,Shale detachment,Passive margin fold belt,Area-depth strain analysis,Offshore southern Morocco,Stratigraphy,Seismic interpretation,"
"assessing the range of radio maritime links in different waterbodies: effect of antenna height and band diversities","2021","In this paper, we analyze the weather information for 14 waterbodies from geographical areas with different meteorological characteristics. We estimate the sub-hourly instances of the evaporation duct height (EDH) throughout a period of 10 years. Then, considering the frequency range 1 to 6 GHz, based on the parabolic equation method, we analyze the quality for a presumed shore-to-ship link throughout 100 km range. We evaluate the maximum range that can be supported for different reliability requirements and we focus specifically on analyzing the gain that can be obtained when antenna height and/or band diversity are used. It was found that for high reliability requirements, the antenna height at the shore is the main factor on deciding the maximum communication range that can be maintained. On the other hand, for applications that tolerate delay and work seasonally on an opportunistic basis, the evaporation duct statistics is the main factor deciding the likelihood of increasing the link range and establishing over-the-horizon communications.","telecommunication network reliability,Antennas,evaporation duct height distributions,reliability requirements,Ducts,Delays,Conferences,microwave antennas,EDH,Reliability,Vehicular and wireless technologies,time 10.0 year,size 100.0 km,antenna height diversity,shore-to-ship communications,band diversities,Meteorology,band diversity,statistical analysis,maximum communication range,parabolic equation method,link range,frequency 1.0 GHz to 6.0 GHz,meteorological characteristics,evaporation duct height,evaporation duct statistics,weather information,radio maritime links,over-the-horizon communications,shore-to-ship link,parabolic equations,marine communication,geographical areas,water bodies,antenna height,"
"chapter 4 - the baltic sea","2019","The Baltic Sea is one of the largest brackish seas in the world with a total surface area of 415,240km2 (including the Danish Straits and Kattegat) with water volume of 21,706km3. Its environmental conditions depend on the hydrological processes in the catchment area, meteorological forcing, oceanographic processes in the sea, and the interactions between these. The water body of the central Baltic is permanently stratified, with an upper layer of low-salinity (6–8psu) water and a more saline (10–14psu) deepwater layer, both separated by a strong halocline. Strong environmental gradients create a variety of habitats with different biota in different subbasins. Due to its young age and reduced salinity the biological structure of the Baltic Sea is relatively restricted. Low species richness is often associated with strong dominance of a few species and high productivity. Being a semienclosed sea surrounded by densely populated and highly industrialized countries, the Baltic Sea is highly vulnerable to anthropogenic pressure. Currently, the major threats to the Baltic Sea are chemical contamination, eutrophication, and hypoxia. Therefore, anthropogenic pressure along with related climate change should be taken into account for assessment of the environmental status of the Baltic Sea and its future changes.","Stratified system,Brackish water,Eutrophication,Density anomaly,Environmental gradients,"

"how maritime education and training (met) instructors address assessment protocol","2020","With the advent of more technologies being utilized on a modern Ships Navigational Bridge it is important to address all human elements that play a role in the safety of the vessel. Of these elements, the training of personal in the use of the ships modern equipment is imperative. To address this, the maritime industry both on the international and national levels implements a series of assessments to validate a potential officer's knowledge base. This study looks to identify the Maritime Bridge Simulators instructor's interpretation of the assessments done on a Navigation simulator. An Auto Ethnographic approach is utilized to highlight current and previous interactions with the former Mariners, who are now educators. These Maritime Education and Training (MET) instructors, who utilize a modern Full Mission Bridge Simulator, as they assess a navigational bridge team will be examined. The preliminary understanding and projected findings is that both the performance based assessment and the interactive assessments done on these simulators, inform teaching and enhance learning experiences. However, the assessments themselves which are mandated, are vague and unsuccessful in properly assessing a future Maritime Officer. As Mariners have all experienced some subject matter experts who may have all of the qualifications needed to teach, yet are incapable of doing so. On the other hand, some may not have mastery of the subject but are able to pass on the knowledge needed for one to succeed sufficiently. In a worst-case scenario, there are those who â€œcan neither do nor teach.â€ How can we prevent these instances from offering? Is there something within mandated regulations that can be used to avoid this from occurring? Could there be a cultural or societal aspect that we can use as a preventative means? These questions are difficult to answer. There is a need to be judged on many levels, as well as discussed and debated. Instructors in the Maritime industry are no different than the Instructors in other fields. They have all been exposed to the subject that they are required to teach, how they prepare and interpret the lessons needed is not always the same as one would think. Simulation as an educational tool has been used across a broad spectrum of subjects and industries. How these simulations are integrated within the classroom differs depending on the simulator. One of the main objectives of simulation is Project-Based learning. Simulations that encompass the Project-Based Learning design can be defined as complex tasks based on difficult questions. These situations provoke the student to design, implement problem-solving, and decision making processes. The fact-finding activities embedded in the simulation can provide students with situations where they need to work independently over significant periods. At the end of the simulation, there is a concluding event that emulates realistic products or situations [1]. In addition to the â€œProjectâ€ associated with this theory, there are other defining factors; these factors include authentic content, authentic assessment, teacher facilitation, and clear educational goals[2]. All of these play a significant role within the realm of Maritime Simulation. For a successful Simulation of a Ships Navigational bridge to occur, the preliminary understanding and projected findings is that the performance-based assessment and the interactive assessments done on these simulators, inform teaching and enhance learning experiences. In order to accomplish this, many challenges are facing the educators that operate these simulated exercises. The first challenge is the Professional Development of the educators. Unlike most professional educators, the requirements to teach within this field are limited. The students that these instructors teach also differ in that they are an older student. This method is called Andragogy. The way the instructor approaches this must be different from the Petrological approach of young students. The final challenge addressed here is the instructor's interpretation of both international and national regulations. By utilizing Authentic Assessment, educators need to cultivate a better understanding of the concept or subject taught and focus less on the improved learning outcomes associated with them [3].","international regulations,interactive assessments,Project-Based Learning,human elements,project-based learning design,Regulation,Andragogy,assessment protocol,MET Instructors,Industries,Marine vehicles,modern ships navigational bridge,potential officer,maritime simulation,Bridges,Instructor Training,educational courses,preliminary understanding,Mariners,Maritime Simulation,ships,Authentic Assessment,navigational bridge team,marine engineering,clear educational goals,international levels,educational tool,Auto Ethnographic approach,computer based training,decision making,Professional Development,modern Full Mission Bridge Simulator,ships modern equipment,simulated exercises,teaching,Maritime Education and Training,performance-based assessment,MET,subject matter experts,Performance-based Assessment,future maritime officer,professional educators,maritime industry,Navigation,Task analysis,performance based assessment,Tools,authentic assessment,learning experiences,maritime education and training instructors,navigation simulator,maritime bridge simulators instructor,"

"estimates of tidal mixing in the indonesian archipelago from multidisciplinary indomix in-situ data","2015","The Indonesian Mixing program (INDOMIX) was designed to quantify the very strong mixing that transforms Pacific waters into isohaline Indonesian Waters in the Indonesian archipelago. The turbulent dissipation rates and associated mixing were estimated and analyzed using a multidisciplinary approach that combines physical and geochemical in-situ observations: (1) direct measurements of the dissipation using a microstructure profiler, (2) use of density-based fine-scale methods applied to CTD and XCTD data, and (3) study of the vertical distribution of natural radionuclides (radium isotopes and actinium-227). Data were collected at five contrasting stations within the Indonesian archipelago, found above energetic straits or in relatively quiescent large basins. Strong instabilities, inversions of the density profiles and a very strong water mass transformation were observed. A wide range of dissipation values were obtained (between [10−10, 10−4]Wkg−1) with spots of higher dissipation in the ocean interior correlated with a strong internal tide signal. Both the fine-scale and micro-scale methods allow us to identify very strong energy dissipation levels above the straits, ranging between [10−7, 10−4]Wkg−1, in contrast to lower values at stations further away from the generation sites. The dissipation for the station located in the center of the Halmahera Sea ([10−9, 10−8]Wkg−1) is stronger than for the Banda station ([10−11, 10−10]Wkg−1), which is even further away from the generation sites. The three approaches agree relatively well and provide vertical eddy diffusivities values ranging between 5×10−4 and 5×10−1m2s−1, except in the Banda Sea where values are similar to the ones found in the open ocean (10−6m2s−1). CTD and XCTD profilers (deployed between stations) give estimates of dissipation all along the transit. It is found that enhanced mixing occurs preferentially above rough topography, such as in the Ombai Strait, the Halmahera Sea’s northern entrance, the Buru strait and Sumba strait. Finestructure parameters are very sensitive to depth and dissipation, which differs between stations. We recommend more systematic microstructure measurement in order to tune these parameters. Surface mixing, at the base of the mixed layer is found to be very strong with values between [10−4, 10−3m2s−1]. These results confirm the modeling studies that suggest the occurrence of intensified subsurface mixing which cools the sea surface temperatures and thus strongly affects the mean and variability of the tropical climate. We conclude, therefore, that climate models need to take into account this intensified ocean mixing to properly represent the mean state of the atmosphere and its climate variability.","Vertical mixing,Microstructure,Internal tides,Natural radionuclides,Finestructure,Indonesian seas,"
"ecological bridges and barriers in pelagic ecosystems","2017","Many highly mobile species are known to use persistent pathways or corridors to move between habitat patches in which conditions are favorable for particular activities, such as breeding or foraging. In the marine realm, environmental variability can lead to the development of temporary periods of anomalous oceanographic conditions that can connect individuals to areas of habitat outside a population's usual range, or alternatively, restrict individuals from areas usually within their range, thus acting as ecological bridges or ecological barriers. These temporary features can result in novel or irregular trophic interactions and changes in population spatial dynamics, and, therefore, may have significant implications for management of marine ecosystems. Here, we provide evidence of ecological bridges and barriers in different ocean regions, drawing upon five case studies in which particular oceanographic conditions have facilitated or restricted the movements of individuals from highly migratory species. We discuss the potential population-level significance of ecological bridges and barriers, with respect to the life history characteristics of different species, and inter- and intra-population variability in habitat use. Finally, we summarize the persistence of bridge dynamics with time, our ability to monitor bridges and barriers in a changing climate, and implications for forecasting future climate-mediated ecosystem change.","Population connectivity,Tuna,Oceanographic features,Species distribution,Migration corridors,Billfish,Brazilian episode,Marine mammal,"
"the saral/altika mission: a step forward to the future of altimetry","2021","The CNES/ISRO altimetric satellite SARAL/AltiKa was launched in February 2013 and since then has provided useful data for various scientific and operational applications in oceanography, hydrology, cryospheric sciences and geodesy. However, a Reaction Wheel problem forced relaxation of the repeatability constraint on the satellite’s orbit, which has been drifting slowly since July 2016. Beyond the expected contributions of this mission and its very good integration into the objectives of the constellation of altimetric satellites, it has become more and more apparent that specific contributions and innovations related to the main specification of SARAL/AltiKa, that is to say the use of the Ka-band, have clearly emerged. The advantages of the Ka-band are in short the reduction of ionosphere effects, the smaller footprint, the better horizontal resolution and the higher vertical resolution. A drawback of the Ka-band is the attenuation due to water/water vapor in case of rain and the resulting loss of data. The main objective of this paper is to highlight the specific advances of the Ka-band in different scientific and technical fields and to show why they are promising for the future and open the way to several missions or mission projects. Although unplanned initially, the fine coverage of the Drifting Phase brings some interesting openings especially for geodesy and hydrology applications.","Satellite,Altimetry,Ka-band,"
"the structure and dynamics of multilayer networks","2014","In the past years, network theory has successfully characterized the interaction among the constituents of a variety of complex systems, ranging from biological to technological, and social systems. However, up until recently, attention was almost exclusively given to networks in which all components were treated on equivalent footing, while neglecting all the extra information about the temporal- or context-related properties of the interactions under study. Only in the last years, taking advantage of the enhanced resolution in real data sets, network scientists have directed their interest to the multiplex character of real-world systems, and explicitly considered the time-varying and multilayer nature of networks. We offer here a comprehensive review on both structural and dynamical organization of graphs made of diverse relationships (layers) between its constituents, and cover several relevant issues, from a full redefinition of the basic structural measures, to understanding how the multilayer nature of the network affects processes and dynamics.",""
"obligations and challenges for national maritime administrations concerning the latest requirement for ships to carry ecdis equipment","2007","Since the earliest sailing exploits, the safety of navigation has been conditioned by the availability and reliability of adequate shipboard navigation aids. Surely, the success of such exploits also depended on officers' competence for using these aids in an adequate manner. Through the centuries, there were no significant changes in the technical performance of basic navigation aids or in their usage, and therefore there was no need for additional education of navigation officers. However, a rapid technological development in many areas of human activities has brought about significant changes in the last several decades. Maritime transport of goods is an important part of the total transport of goods in the world, the result of which is a rapid development and the use of state-of-the-art technologies in the design and building of ships of different sizes and for different purposes. Such dynamics of the use of new technologies in the maritime transport has not followed the dynamics of the development of modern navigation systems. For that reason, even today a great number of ships are fitted with navigation equipment whose safety level is lower than that of the modern navigation systems used in other kinds of transport. Having recognized such situation in the last few years, competent international organisations, first of all the International Maritime Organisation and the International Hydrographic Organisation, have made special efforts to introduce state-of-the-art navigation equipment in the maritime transport.","nautical charts,ship design,International Maritime Organisation,navigational aids,Displays,navigation equipment,Marine vehicles,Buildings,standards,oceanography,ECDIS equipment,navigation systems,maritime policy,ships,marine safety,high speed craft,maritime transport,Availability,Humans,e-navigation. hydrographic office,electronic charts,US Department of Transportation,maritime regulations,navigation safety,safety of navigation,nautical handbooks,Safety devices,iInformation system,electronic navigational chart,Information technology,national maritime administrations,ship building,charts,shipbuilding industry,legislation,Marine safety,shipboard navigation aids,Navigation,navigation,digital information,International Hydrographic Organisation,"
"an overview of monitoring methods for assessing the performance of nature-based solutions against natural hazards","2021","To bring to fruition the capability of nature-based solutions (NBS) in mitigating hydro-meteorological risks (HMRs) and facilitate their widespread uptake require a consolidated knowledge-base related to their monitoring methods, efficiency, functioning and the ecosystem services they provide. We attempt to fill this knowledge gap by reviewing and compiling the existing scientific literature on methods, including ground-based measurements (e.g. gauging stations, wireless sensor network) and remote sensing observations (e.g. from topographic LiDAR, multispectral and radar sensors) that have been used and/or can be relevant to monitor the performance of NBS against five HMRs: floods, droughts, heatwaves, landslides, and storm surges and coastal erosion. These can allow the mapping of the risks and impacts of the specific hydro-meteorological events. We found that the selection and application of monitoring methods mostly rely on the particular NBS being monitored, resource availability (e.g. time, budget, space) and type of HMRs. No standalone method currently exists that can allow monitoring the performance of NBS in its broadest view. However, equipments, tools and technologies developed for other purposes, such as for ground-based measurements and atmospheric observations, can be applied to accurately monitor the performance of NBS to mitigate HMRs. We also focused on the capabilities of passive and active remote sensing, pointing out their associated opportunities and difficulties for NBS monitoring application. We conclude that the advancement in airborne and satellite-based remote sensing technology has signified a leap in the systematic monitoring of NBS performance, as well as provided a robust way for the spatial and temporal comparison of NBS intervention versus its absence. This improved performance measurement can support the evaluation of existing uncertainty and scepticism in selecting NBS over the artificially built concrete structures or grey approaches by addressing the questions of performance precariousness. Remote sensing technical developments, however, take time to shift toward a state of operational readiness for monitoring the progress of NBS in place (e.g. green NBS growth rate, their changes and effectiveness through time). More research is required to develop a holistic approach, which could routinely and continually monitor the performance of NBS over a large scale of intervention. This performance evaluation could increase the ecological and socio-economic benefits of NBS, and also create high levels of their acceptance and confidence by overcoming potential scepticism of NBS implementations.","In-situ measurement,NBS monitoring,Synthetic aperture radar,Remote sensing,Key performance indicators,"

Adopting a geoarchaeological approach, the combination of sedimentological, palynological, and geophysical data enables the reconstruction of various stages in the landscape evolution of the Lower Sagone River over the last 4000years, together with the history of human occupation. The methods consist of a palaeoenvironmental study of 9 boreholes drilled in the modern deltaic plain, at a maximum distance of 500m from the present-day shoreline. The laboratory analyses included mollusk identification and measurements of the grain-size distribution (by wet sieving). A series of 21 radiocarbon dates on charcoal, plant remains, wood fragments, and marine mollusk samples formed the basis for a chronostratigraphy. In order to reconstruct the vegetation history of the catchment, with particular attention to anthropogenic activity, pollen analysis was conducted on clay samples from the deepest borehole, and they revealed a semi-open forest during the Bronze Age and Late Iron Age with extensive pastoral activity and limited cereal cultivation. Electric Resistivity Tomography (ERT) of 3 profiles across the alluvial plain was conducted in order to reveal the geometry of the sedimentary bodies. The salient features are the presence of a freshwater lake during the Mid- to Late Bronze Age (from 1500 to 1100cal. BCE), its transformation into an open marine bay from ca. 1100 until 500cal.

We use a combination of new and legacy analytical datasets (NAA and XRF), from excavated ceramics, to evaluate the potential compositional range of local resources (based on comparisons with sediments from within a 10 km site radius). Results show a clear distinction between sediment-defined local and non-local ceramic compositional groups. Two discrete local ceramic resources have been previously identified and we confirm a third local resource for a major class of EIA handmade wares and cooking pots. This third source appears to derive from a residual resource on the Troy peninsula (rather than adjacent alluvial valleys). The presence of a group of large and heavy pithoi among the non-local groups raises questions about their regional or maritime origin.","Local production,Bottom-up sampling,Macro-analysis,Multivariate analysis,Neutron Activation Analysis,Statistical power relationships,Legacy datasets,"
"maritime traffic route detection framework based on statistical density analysis from ais data using a clustering algorithm","2022","Maritime traffic routes by ships navigation vary according to country and geographic characteristics, and they differ according to the characteristics of the ships. In ocean areas adjacent to coasts, regulated routes are present, e.g., traffic separation scheme for ships entering and leaving; however, most ocean areas do not have such routes. Maritime traffic route research has been conducted based on computer engineering to create routes; however, ship characteristics were not considered. Thus, this article proposes a framework to generate maritime traffic routes using statistical density analysis. Here, automatic identification system (AIS) data are used to derive quantitative traffic routes. Preprocessing is applied to the AIS data, and a similar ship trajectory pattern is decomposed into a matrix based on the Hausdorffâ€“distance algorithm and then stored in a database. A similar pattern makes the AIS trajectory simple using the Douglasâ€“Peucker algorithm. In addition, density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) is performed to identify the waypoints of vessels then create routes by connecting waypoints. The width of maritime routes created based on a similar ship trajectory is subjected to kernel density estimation analysis (KDE). Then, waypoints evaluation of the main route is performed from the results of KDE 75% and 90% considering the statistical in the total maritime traffic, and the results applied to the targeted ocean area are compared. Finally, the result of KDE 90% of maritime traffic with framework analyzed the safety route, which can be a basis for developing routes for maritime autonomous surface ships.","traffic separation scheme,ocean areas,marine accidents,Clustering algorithms,Safety,targeted ocean area,Douglas-Peucker algorithm,automatic identification system data,vehicle routing,total maritime traffic,Marine vehicles,maritime autonomous surface ships,quantitative traffic routes,geographic characteristics,DBSCAN,statistical analysis,ships,marine safety,kernel density estimation,AIS trajectory simple,maritime traffic route detection framework,kernel density estimation analysis,Oceans,Hausdorff-distance algorithm,ship trajectory pattern,framework,pattern clustering,Artificial intelligence,statistical density analysis,marine engineering computing,Trajectory,ship characteristics,maritime traffic route research,Navigation,safety route,density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise,clustering algorithm,AIS data,maritime traffic route,"
"geochemistry and petrology of witwatersrand and dwyka diamictites from south africa: search for an extraterrestrial component","2001","Diamictites are poorly sorted sediments characteristically carrying coarse-grained clasts in a fine-grained matrix. They have generally been considered of glaciogenic or glaciomarine origin. Recently, however, it has been suggested that some massive tillite/diamictite layers could represent impact breccias. An earlier petrographic study of rock and mineral clasts from Dwyka Group diamictites revealed no evidence for shock metamorphism, such as planar deformation features. Detailed geochemical studies of diamictite samples from the Archean Witwatersrand Supergroup and the Dwyka Group of the Mesozoic Karoo Supergroup from South Africa are reported. We studied the contents of the siderophile elements in these breccias, as elevated abundances of such elements, especially iridium, could be indicative for an impact origin. By use of γ-γ coincidence spectrometry and other trace element analysis, geochemical tracers of extraterrestrial components were sought. However, no enrichments of indicator elements for extraterrestrial components, compared with ordinary continental crust, were found. Thus, neither geochemical nor petrographic evidence supports an impact origin of the diamictites from the Dwyka Group and the Witwatersrand Supergroup in South Africa.",""
"toward the automated construction of probabilistic knowledge graphs for the maritime domain","2021","International maritime crime is becoming increasingly sophisticated, often associated with wider criminal networks. Detecting maritime threats by means of fusing data purely related to physical movement (i.e., those generated by physical sensors, or hard data) is not sufficient. This has led to research and development efforts aimed at combining hard data with other types of data (especially human-generated or soft data). Existing work often assumes that input soft data is available in a structured format, or is focused on extracting certain relevant entities or concepts to accompany or annotate hard data. Much less attention has been given to extracting the rich knowledge about the situations of interest implicitly embedded in the large amount of soft data existing in unstructured formats (such as intelligence reports and news articles). In order to exploit the potentially useful and rich information from such sources, it is necessary to extract not only the relevant entities and concepts, but also their semantic relations, together with the uncertainty associated with the extracted knowledge (i.e., in the form of probabilistic knowledge graphs). This will increase the accuracy of, and confidence in, the extracted knowledge and facilitate subsequent reasoning and learning. To this end, we propose Maritime DeepDive, an initial prototype for the automated construction of probabilistic knowledge graphs from natural language data for the maritime domain.

"variability of lightning activity in south/southeast asia during 1997–98 and 2002–03 el nino/la nina events","2012","Impacts of the 1997–98 and 2002–03 ENSOs on total number of flashes and number of flash days from the LIS (Lightning Imaging Sensor) on board the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission satellite and on the average flash rate from the combined OTD (Optical Transient Detector) / LIS data are studied in South/Southeast Asia (8° –30°N, 60°–120°E) for the period 1998–2005. Also examined is the difference between the geographical distributions of these parameters in the El Nino period in 1998 and in the corresponding normal period in 1999. During the 1997–98 ENSO event, the number of flashes and average flash rate increase by 12% and 36%, respectively, during the El Nino period and during the La Nina period decrease by 22% and 5%, respectively, as compared to the corresponding normal periods. Similarly, during the 2002–2003 ENSO event, the number of flashes and average flash rate increase by 28% and 5% during the El Nino period in 2002 as compared to the corresponding normal period. The contrast in lightning activity between the El Nino and La Nina periods is more pronounced in Southeast Asia than in South Asia because of the southeastward shift in the convection activity during the ENSO events. In both regions, however, monthly variations of both total number of flashes and average flash rate are almost parallel to that of surface temperature. Although, the inverse relationship between the Indian Summer Monsoon Rainfall (ISMR) and El Nino broke down in 1997–98, the relationship between the El Nino and lightning maintains its normal increasing trend, indicating that the lightning activity is more sensitive to the convective activity than to rainfall on seasonal time scale. The total number of flashes and aerosol loading increase in the break‐period regime as compared to the monsoonal regime. The number of flash days in both ENSO events is higher in the EL Nino phase and lower in the La Nina phase as compared to their normal values in the subsequent years. Enhancement of lightning activity is mostly concentrated over land areas. Our results show that although diurnal variations in lightning activity can be related to the variations in surface temperature, convective adjustment induced by the corresponding ENSO phase needs to be considered for explaining the lightning activity variations on these longer time scales.","ENSO impact,South/Southeast Asia,El Nino impact,Lightning activity,"
"gipsyx/rtgx, a new tool set for space geodetic operations and research","2020","GipsyX/RTGx is the Jet Propulsion Laboratory’s (JPL) next generation software package for positioning, navigation, timing, and Earth science using measurements from three geodetic techniques: Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR), and Doppler Orbitography and Radiopositioning Integrated by Satellite (DORIS); with Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) under development.

"multiple oceanographic hf surface-wave radars applied to maritime surveillance","2014","In the context of maritime surveillance, low-power high-frequency surface-wave (HFSW) radars are attracting significant attention as cost-effective tools for long-range ship detection and tracking applications. In this paper, multi-target tracking and data fusion techniques are applied to live-recorded data from a network of three oceanographic HFSW radars installed on the coast of the German Bight, in the North Sea. This campaign follows a previous one conducted in 2009, in which two HFSW radars were deployed on the coast of the Ligurian Sea, in the Mediterranean. Ship reports from the automatic identification system, recorded from a number of coastal stations, are exploited as ground truth information. A methodology is then applied to classify the fused tracks and to estimate single-sensor and data fusion performances. Both in situ and model data are used to investigate the capabilities of the systems according to the variations of the meteorological and oceanographic conditions. Finally, preliminary results are presented and discussed, together with outlines for future works.","cost-effective tools,model data,sensor fusion,marine radar,data fusion techniques,long-range ship detection applications,ship reports,coastal stations,long-range ship tracking applications,Ligurian sea coast,data fusion,Sea measurements,low-power high-frequency surface-wave radars,single-sensor estimation,fused tracks,target detection and tracking,Covariance matrices,multitarget tracking,target tracking,High-frequency surface-wave radar,ships,automatic identification system,meteorological and oceanographic information,systems capability,maritime surveillance,Target tracking,object detection,multiple oceanographic HF surface-wave radars,German bight coast,search radar,Radar tracking,Logic gates,HFSW radars,real data,meteorological conditions,Sensors,Mediterranean,north sea,ground truth information,situ data,oceanographic techniques,"
"unsupervised reconstruction of sea surface currents from ais maritime traffic data using learnable variational models","2021","Space oceanography missions, especially altimeter missions, have considerably improved the observation of sea surface dynamics over the last decades. They can however hardly resolve spatial scales below ~ 100km. Meanwhile the AIS (Automatic Identification System) monitoring of the maritime traffic implicitly conveys information on the underlying sea surface currents as the trajectory of ships is affected by the current. Here, we show that an unsupervised variational learning scheme provides new means to elucidate how AIS data streams can be converted into sea surface currents. The proposed scheme relies on a learnable variational framework and relate to variational auto-encoder approach coupled with neural ODE (Ordinary Differential Equation) solving the targeted ill-posed inverse problem. Through numerical experiments on a real AIS dataset, we demonstrate how the proposed scheme could significantly improve the reconstruction of sea surface currents from AIS data compared with state-of-the-art methods, including altimetry-based ones.","AIS maritime traffic data,neural ODE,unsupervised learning,sea surface currents,size 100.0 km,space oceanography missions,AIS dataset,learnable variational models,variational learning,AIS data streams,ocean circulation,unsupervised variational learning scheme,Sea surface,unsupervised reconstruction,Artificial intelligence,Surface reconstruction,Numerical models,targeted ill-posed inverse problem,data assimilation,learnable variational framework,Training,Sea surface currents,Trajectory,sea surface dynamics,variational auto-encoder approach,AIS monitoring,Inverse problems,oceanographic techniques,"
"remote sensing satellite technology to determine the center of the maritime defense logistics route for securing the indonesian capital city (ikn)","2022","Displacement of the capital of Indonesia has been provided for in Law Number 3 of 2022, namely the IKN Nusantara which is one of the centers of gravity or the center of national strategic strength so that security for the area is very much needed. In order to secure the IKN from all possible enemy attacks, a military defense base is needed that functions as a Logistics support center to support all military operations. The purpose of this study is to determine a strategic location as a center for maritime defense logistics distribution lines in order to secure the IKN area using the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) method combined with satellite image analysis using a Geographic Information System (GIS) by considering the criteria and sub-criteria in determining the location center for maritime defense logistics distribution lines. The results of the research from the AHP weighting method show that the priority order of criteria based on experts is safety from natural conditions, population conditions, environmental locations, distribution line conditions, and required cost. The results of remote sensing satellite image data processing with analysis using Geographic Information Systems with ArcGIS software shows that the results of satellite image overlays are equipped with regional boundaries and routes around IKN. The determination of the location of the center of the distribution line for the defense logistics of the marine sector is concentrated in Samboja District, surely in the Kampung Lama Village which is also used as the location point for the pier plan.

"magnetic detection of archaeological hearths in alaska: a tool for investigating the full span of human presence at the gateway to north america","2019","Magnetic survey methods have recently shown tremendous potential for the detection of archaeological hearths in Eastern Beringia, ranging from intermittent open-air camp fires to larger heat intensive activity areas. Here we present an overview of the method along with eight supporting case studies from seven U.S. National Park Service units in the U.S. state of Alaska, covering diverse geographic settings and time-periods. Together, these case studies demonstrate the capabilities of magnetic detection instruments in various modes of operation for finding datable archaeological deposits that span the breadth of known human occupation of this region. The examples range from the simplest use of the magnetometer as a single sensor reconnaissance instrument in a “search mode”, to use as a gradiometer in conjunction with other geophysical methods such as ground-penetrating radar, to record precise measurements and inform nuanced interpretations. Examples presented here range from the terminal Pleistocene to historic periods, spanning 12,000 years of human activity in Eastern Beringia, and encompassing the arrival, emergence, and expansion of multiple human groups or cultural traditions in the New World.","Arctic,Pleistocene,Denbigh,Bering land bridge,Magnetometer,Hearth,Arctic small tool,Paleoarctic,Northern Archaic,Thule,Ocean Bay,Alaska,Inupiat,Beringia,Birnirk,Norton,"
"elemental geochemistry and organic facies of selected cretaceous coals from the benue trough basin in nigeria: implication for paleodepositional environments","2022","Benue Trough basin is geologically subdivided into three segments. It consists of marine and continental sediments that are affected by folding movements. In the upper section, the continental coal-bearing Campano-Maastrichtian-age is found within Gombe Sandstone and the Cenozoic Kerri-Kerri Formation of the Tertiary. In the middle segment, the late Turonian/early Santonian coal-bearing Awgu Formation lies conformably on the Ezeaku Formation. In the lower part, shales at Nkporo mark marine incursion and deposition of the Maastrichtian Mamu Formation coal measures. Cretaceous coal samples taken from the three segments of Benue Trough basin were examined using ultimate and proximate, organic petrographic, x-ray fluorescence (XRF) and laser ablation-induced coupled plasma spectroscopy (LA-ICPMS) analytical techniques. Results of trace element ratios, Ce/Ce* values (“where Ce* is the theoretical Ce value derived from a chondrite-normalized rare earth element (REE) pattern”), authigenic uranium values, and low hydrogen content indicate deposition under oxic to suboxic conditions. However, the V/Ni and V/Sc ratios indicate under oxic, suboxic to reducing conditions. The Y/Ho values for selected coals are lower than the range for seawater, indicating terrigenous influence. The Sr/Ba values indicate low influence of saline water during deposition and a strong continental rather than marine influence. High value of vitrinite and low proportion of liptinite/intertinite suggest that peat in the study areas were situated on the irregular basin floor where sediment thicknesses vary from place to place thus the depositional environments shifted causing mineral matter filling in coal. Based on the tissue preservation index (TPI) and gelification index (GI), LFB, CHK, OKB, LMZ, IMG; and ENG (high GI and high TPI) were deposited in telmatic facies; wet-forest swamps with rapid organic matter accumulation. This trend indicates mild humification and strong gelification of plant tissues which ascribed to high rate of subsidence with wood- and bark-derived telovitrinite. The MGA peats were deposited in terrestrial facies in a dry-forest swamp with wood-derived telo-inertinite. The coal samples code-named IMG and ENG were deposited in planar margin mires. However, coal samples code-named LFB, CHK and LMZ were deposited in planar central mires. Lastly, OKB and MGA were deposited in transitional-wet and transitional-dry mire. The low V and Ni concentrations, low H/C, high O/C, high C/N, and very low N/C ratios <0.05 implies Type III land-plant organic matter that is not oil-prone. The depositional environments interpretations of investigated coal seams indicate that the coals were deposited within a telmatic, limnic, limno-telmatic and open march zone. Generally, a combination of results from inorganic geochemistry and organic petrology is required for precise and all-inclusive determination of coal depositional environments.","Macerals,Coal,Petroleum source evaluation,Benue Trough,Depositional facies,"

"relations between climate change and mass movement: perspectives from the canadian cordillera and the european alps","2021","Earth's climate is warming and will continue to warm as the century progresses. High mountains and high latitudes are experiencing the greatest warming of all regions on Earth and also are some of the most sensitive areas to climate change, in part because ecosystems and natural processes in these areas are intimately linked to the cryosphere. Evidence is mounting that warming will further reduce permafrost and snow and ice cover in high mountains, which in turn will destabilize many slopes, alter sediment delivery to streams, and change subalpine and alpine ecosystems. This paper contributes to the continuing discussion of impacts of climate change on mountain environments by comparing and discussing processes and trends in the mountains of western Canada and the European Alps. We highlight the effects of physiography and climate on physical processes occurring in the two regions. Processes of interest include landslides and debris flows induced by glacier debuttressing, alpine permafrost thaw, changes in rainfall regime, formation and sudden drainage of glacier- and moraine-dammed lakes, ice avalanches, glacier surges, and large-scale sediment transfers due to rapid deglacierization. Our analysis points out the value of integrating observations and data from different areas of the world to better understand these processes and their impacts.","Cryosphere,Mass movement,European Alps,Canadian Cordillera,Climate change,"
"a strategy for detecting derelict fishing gear at sea","2012","Derelict fishing gear (DFG) is a highly persistent form of marine pollution known to cause environmental and economic damage. At-sea detection of DFG would support pelagic removal of this gear to prevent and minimize impacts on marine environments and species. In 2008, experts in marine debris, oceanography, remote sensing, and marine policy outlined a strategy to develop the capability to detect and ultimately remove DFG from the open ocean. The strategy includes three interrelated components: understanding the characteristics of the targeted DFG, indirectly detecting DFG by modeling likely locations, and directly detecting pelagic DFG using remote sensing. Together, these components aim to refine the search area, increase the likelihood of detection, and decrease mitigation response time, thereby providing guidance for removal operations. Here, we present this at-sea detection strategy, relate it to relevant extant research and technology, and identify gaps that currently prevent successful at-sea detection and removal of DFG.","Remote sensing,Marine debris,Derelict fishing gear,"

An integrated marine geophysical survey, a hydrographic survey, and a GNSS survey were conducted off Methoni, recording six historic wreck sites, artefacts, the ruins of a submerged prehistoric settlement, and the town's ancient harbour/breakwater, as well as the geophysical properties of the underwater environment. The preliminary project results present bathymetric surfaces, backscatter intensity and magnetic maps, drawings, and seismic reflection profiles of the underwater antiquities and of the seabed, all fused in a 3D geographical platform. The results also shed light on the archaeological potential of the site, the nearshore physical processes, and their effect on the underwater archaeological resources. The project outcomes have shown that the establishment of an underwater archaeological park and diving sites at the cultural heritage sites will support cultural tourism development in the area and will have a positive impact on local socioeconomic development. The underwater archaeological park should comply with the basic principles of a site management plan – one that is established in the context of an integrated coastal management plan that identifies the maritime synergies or conflicts among human activities, archaeological resources, and the local environment, and utilises the 3D synthesis of marine knowledge from the project outcomes as a decision-making tool.","Bathymetry,Marine geophysics,Hydrography,Underwater cultural heritage,Site evolution,Maritime archaeology,"
"chapter 2 fasciola, lymnaeids and human fascioliasis, with a global overview on disease transmission, epidemiology, evolutionary genetics, molecular epidemiology and control","2009","Fascioliasis, caused by liver fluke species of the genus Fasciola, has always been well recognized because of its high veterinary impact but it has been among the most neglected diseases for decades with regard to human infection. However, the increasing importance of human fascioliasis worldwide has re‐launched interest in fascioliasis. From the 1990s, many new concepts have been developed regarding human fascioliasis and these have furnished a new baseline for the human disease that is very different to a simple extrapolation from fascioliasis in livestock. Studies have shown that human fascioliasis presents marked heterogeneity, including different epidemiological situations and transmission patterns in different endemic areas. This heterogeneity, added to the present emergence/re‐emergence of the disease both in humans and animals in many regions, confirms a worrying global scenario. The huge negative impact of fascioliasis on human communities demands rapid action. When analyzing how better to define control measures for endemic areas differing at such a level, it would be useful to have genetic markers that could distinguish each type of transmission pattern and epidemiological situation. Accordingly, this chapter covers aspects of aetiology, geographical distribution, epidemiology, transmission and control in order to obtain a solid baseline for the interpretation of future results. The origins and geographical spread of F. hepatica and F. gigantica in both the ruminant pre‐domestication times and the livestock post‐domestication period are analyzed. Paleontological, archaeological and historical records, as well as genetic data on recent dispersal of livestock species, are taken into account to establish an evolutionary framework for the two fasciolids across all continents. Emphasis is given to the distributional overlap of both species and the roles of transportation, transhumance and trade in the different overlap situations. Areas with only one Fasciola spp. are distinguished from local and zonal overlaps in areas where both fasciolids co‐exist. Genetic techniques applied to liver flukes in recent years that are useful to elucidate the genetic characteristics of the two fasciolids are reviewed. The intra‐specific and inter‐specific variabilities of ‘pure’ F. hepatica and ‘pure’ F. gigantica were ascertained by means of complete sequences of ribosomal deoxyribonucleic acid (rDNA) internal transcribed spacer (ITS)‐2 and ITS‐1 and mitochondrial deoxyribonucleic acid (mtDNA) cox1 and nad1 from areas with only one fasciolid species. Fasciolid sequences of the same markers scattered in the literature are reviewed. The definitive haplotypes established appear to fit the proposed global evolutionary scenario. Problems posed by fasciolid cross‐breeding, introgression and hybridization in overlap areas are analyzed. Nuclear rDNA appears to correlate with adult fluke characteristics and fasciolid/lymnaeid specificity, whereas mtDNA does not. However, flukes sometimes appear so intermediate that they cannot be ascribed to either F. hepatica‐like or F. gigantica‐like forms and snail specificity may be opposite to the one deduced from the adult morphotype. The phenotypic characteristics of adults and eggs of ‘pure’ F. hepatica and F. gigantica, as well as of intermediate forms in overlap areas, are compared, with emphasis on the definitive host influence on egg size in humans. Knowledge is sufficient to support F. hepatica and F. gigantica as two valid species, which recently diverged by adaptation to different pecoran and lymnaeid hosts in areas with differing environmental characteristics. Their phenotypic differences and ancient pre‐domestication origins involve a broad geographical area that largely exceeds the typical, more local scenarios known for sub‐species units. Phenomena such as abnormal ploidy and aspermic parthenogenesis in hybrids suggest that their separate evolution in pre‐domestication times allowed them to achieve almost total genetic isolation. Recent sequencing results suggest that present assumptions on fasciolid‐lymnaeid specificity might be wrong. The crucial role of lymnaeids in fascioliasis transmission, epidemiology and control was the reason for launching a worldwide lymnaeid molecular characterization initiative. This initiative has already furnished useful results on several continents. A standardized methodology for fasciolids and lymnaeids is proposed herein in order that future work is undertaken on a comparable basis. A complete understanding of molecular epidemiology is expected to help greatly in designing global actions and local interventions for control of fascioliasis.",""
"a multi-task learning-based framework for global maritime trajectory and destination prediction with ais data","2022","Automatic Identification System (AIS) was initially developed for tracking ships and avoiding collisions. As numerous small satellites were launched in recent years, millions of AIS messages are captured by these satellite AIS providers every day. The massive amount of data allow shipping firms and port operators to better predict vessels’ movement. In this study, a computational framework is developed to predict future trajectories and destinations of vessels by applying deep learning to the satellite AIS messages containing self-reporting positioning data. We employed deep learning approaches for large-scale maritime prediction and identifies the most suitable deep neural networks for this specific application. Three prediction models, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Dense Neural Networks (DNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) have been tested in the framework. A multi-task learning architecture is implemented based on test results. Through sharing parameters while training, this architecture enables long-term destination predictions by balancing short-term trajectory predictions. The framework is validated globally with the experiments covering five large-scale sea areas. The experimental results demonstrate that the LSTM model with an average accuracy percentage of 85.1% outperforms the CNN and DNN with accuracy percentages of 68.3% and 78.2% respectively. The LSTM model with multi-task architecture can achieve an accuracy of 87.0%. With the proposed computational framework, AIS data can be utilized for maritime predictions, supporting more complex marine applications and covering more expansive geographic areas.","Vessel trajectory prediction,Automatic Identification System,Vessel origin–destination analysis,Vessel destination prediction,"
"anatomically preserved plants in siderite concretions in the shale split of the foord seam: mineralogy, geochemistry, genesis (upper carboniferous, canada)","1999","A shale split in the well-studied Foord Seam (Upper Carboniferous), Stellarton Basin, Nova Scotia, provides a rare opportunity to study little known siderite concretions with anatomically preserved plants from a limnic basin. Siderite concretions occur throughout the split, commonly as sheet-like, inter-connected lepidodendrid logs, or less frequently as spherical masses; they are typically vuggy. A sample of 14 stratigraphically oriented concretions in the split shows that primary siderite varies from 45% to 80% (wt.%) due to selective replacement by 5% to 40% ferroan dolomite or ankerite in plant tissues. These two minerals show large Mg/Fe and Mg/Ca variability and are Fezoned. Clay content ranges from trace to 20%, and quartz from 5% to 10%. Partial cell-wall destruction by erosion and changeable oxic/anoxic conditions, prior to siderite permineralization, resulted in preservation mainly of the more resistant plant tissues. On average, carbon from siderite is isotopically heavier (+4.8±1.9 0/00) than that from `dolomite' (−7.2±1.1 0/00). The distribution of and the positive correlation between δ13C and δ18O probably reflects the two fractionation processes associated with methanogenesis and `dolomitization', respectively, in the genetic history of the siderite concretions in the split. Siderite concretions formed diagenetically early from bicarbonate under reducing conditions in a slightly alkaline freshwater environment that precluded calcite deposition.","genesis,mineralogy,anatomically preserved plants,Carboniferous siderite concretions,"
"resilience assessment of maritime container shipping networks â€“ a case of the maritime silk road","2019","This paper presents a framework for the resilience assessment of maritime shipping networks by quantifying its recovery performance under natural hazards.

The service performance of the maritime shipping network is indicated by the global network efficiency, and the resilience of maritime shipping network is associated to the network performance loss triangle considering the whole process from a partial disruption to full recovery. The proposed resilience assessment method is applied to a container shipping network of the Maritime Silk Road (MSR) under the storm risks. Two recovery strategies, which are random recovery strategy and multi-centrality based recovery strategy, are adopted respectively, and the recovery performance of the container shipping network under different strategies are comparatively analyzed.

"an overview of cawses-india program with emphasis to equatorial atmospheric coupling processes","2012","This paper presents an overview of CAWSES—India program, highlighting some of the Indian coordinated efforts to understand the Sun−Earth system as a whole, with special emphasis to the equatorial and low latitude phenomena. Two multi-institutional, multi-instrument campaigns, one under ‘Space Weather: Science and Applications’ and the other emphasizing tides under ‘Atmospheric Coupling Processes’ were conducted during February–April 2006. The highlights of the campaigns include improved prediction of equatorial spread-F (ESF) based on a ‘new factor’ combining the strength and asymmetry of the equatorial ionization anomaly (EIA); simultaneous detection of quasi-2-day wave at both E and F region heights; tomographic image showing a Traveling Ionospheric Disturbance (TID) in association with a counter electrojet (CEJ) event—all highlighting the neutral and electrodynamical coupling of the equatorial ionosphere−thermosphere regions; an unusual lowering of mesospheric temperature during a moderate geomagnetic storm—highlighting a new space weather effect; diurnal tide showing a peak amplitude of 35m/s at 45km in zonal wind and a significantly lower amplitude (∼15m/s) in the meridional wind and also evidence of convective activity in the lower atmosphere influencing the tidal variability in the Mesosphere−Lower Thermosphere (MLT) region highlighting the vertical coupling of the atmospheric regions. The development of models for equatorial and low latitude ionosphere has been among the prime activities taken up under ‘Space Climate’. Two models have been developed towards this end: one based on Second Degree (SD) relationships of F region parameters to the mean sun spot number and the other a Multiple Regression Analysis (MRA) based model involving expressions relating F region parameters to that representing solar and geomagnetic activities. The two models, intended for long and short term predictions, have been found to represent the equatorial and low latitude ionosphere over Indian longitudes better than the commonly used International Reference Ionosphere (IRI). Under the theme of ‘Solar Influence on Atmospheric Climate’, a study has been made on the effects of solar variability on middle atmosphere using satellite data and model simulations, highlighting the significant differences between them.","Ionosphere,Magnetosphere,CAWSES,Stratosphere–troposphere,Solarwind,Mesosphere,Thermosphere,"
"perturbation analysis for maritime applications","2012","Target detection of marine features is a major topic for the security and monitoring of coastlines. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) has been shown to be particularly useful because of its all-weather and night capability. In this paper a methodology based on the perturbation analysis developed by the authors is presented. The latter can be applied for detection of ships (non-marine targets) or classification of sea ice. The algorithm can be considered to be a negative filter focused on sea. Consequently, all the features which have a polarimetric behaviour different from the sea are detected and considered as targets. A complete validation with RADARSAT-2 full polarimetric data was performed in Portsmouth, UK. An accurate ground truth carried out during the acquisition, was accompanied, considering AIS GPS location and photographic evidences. Moreover, a map of the buoys helped locating this typology of targets. The results showed impressive accuracy, with detection of all the vessels seen during the ground truth.","Clutter,Classification algorithms,Vectors,Scattering,Marine vehicles,Detectors,Feature extraction,"
"smart anomaly detection for slocum underwater gliders with a variational autoencoder with long short-term memory networks","2022","Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are used extensively for monitoring the world’s oceans, taking measurements of oceanographic characteristics along the water column. Presently, there is no holistic anomaly detection system in operation and AUVs require experienced pilots to monitor the progress of missions. This results in a large operational overhead and reduces the number of AUVs that can be deployed simultaneously. This article proposes an online anomaly detection system for underwater gliders based on a data-driven approach. A novel Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Variational Autoencoder (VAE) has been developed and trained using field data from four deployments with healthy glider behaviour and then tested against four deployments where faults are present. The system is able to detect wing loss with a high degree of accuracy on gliders unseen during the models training, highlighting the generality of the model to different platforms. Additionally, the VAE method outperforms model-based solution for the detection of biofouling, proving its generality to different types of anomalies. The proposed smart anomaly detection will contribute to increasing the capacity of AUVs and reducing the dependence on support vessels and experienced pilots.","Underwater glider,Variational autoencoder,Marine autonomous system,Anomaly detection,Long short-term memory network,"
"super-ensemble forecasts and resulting acoustic sensitivities in shallow waters","2009","Multi-model Super-Ensembles (SE) which optimally combine different models, have been shown to significantly improve atmospheric weather and climate predictions. In the highly dynamic coastal ocean, the presence of small-scales processes, the lack of real-time data, and the limited skill of operational models at the meso-scale have so far limited the application of SE methods for acoustic Rapid Environmental Assessment purposes. In the framework of the BP07 experiment conducted South East of Elba, sound speed prediction skills of various SE techniques combining operational model outputs and in-situ measurements are assessed. Results suggest that SE-based predictions provide more robust 24 h forecasts. A detailed acoustic propagation sensitivity study at different frequencies and ranges also reviews the potential of these predictions for acoustic inversion and tomography efforts.","Kalman filter,Ocean-acoustic predictions,Tomography,Data assimilation,Sound speed,Multi-model super-ensemble,"

"material discrimination using scattering and stopping of cosmic ray muons and electrons: differentiating heavier from lighter metals as well as low-atomic weight materials","2015","Reported is a new method to apply cosmic-ray tomography in a manner that can detect and characterize not only dense assemblages of heavy nuclei (like Special Nuclear Materials, SNM) but also assemblages of medium- and light-atomic-mass materials (such as metal parts, conventional explosives, and organic materials). Characterization may enable discrimination between permitted contents in commerce and contraband (explosives, illegal drugs, and the like). Our Multi-Mode Passive Detection System (MMPDS) relies primarily on the muon component of cosmic rays to interrogate Volumes of Interest (VOI). Muons, highly energetic and massive, pass essentially un-scattered through materials of light atomic mass and are only weakly scattered by conventional metals used in industry. Substantial scattering and absorption only occur when muons encounter sufficient thicknesses of heavy elements characteristic of lead and SNM. Electrons are appreciably scattered by light elements and stopped by sufficient thicknesses of materials containing medium-atomic-mass elements (mostly metals). Data include simulations based upon GEANT and measurements in the HMT (Half Muon Tracker) detector in Poway, CA and a package scanner in both Poway and Socorro NM. A key aspect of the present work is development of a useful parameter, designated the “stopping power” of a sample. The low-density regime, comprising organic materials up to aluminum, is characterized using very little scattering but a strong variation in stopping power. The medium-to-high density regime shows a larger variation in scattering than in stopping power. The detection of emitted gamma rays is another useful signature of some materials.","Material properties,Contraband,Radiation length,Homeland security,Cosmic rays,Highly enriched uranium,"
"reversals of the geomagnetic field, magnetostratigraphy, and relative magnitude of paleosecular variation in the phanerozoic","1976","The percentage of normal and reversed magnetization in land-based paleomagnetic studies of Phanerozoic rocks (0 to − 570 m.y.) have been compiled in order to determine the long-term variation in polarity bias of the geomagnetic field. Where possible the results are compared with the record from marine magnetic anomalies. Only rarely is there an even balance between normal and reversed polarity. During the past 350 m.y. two quiet intervals can be recognized when few reversals occurred, the Cretaceous (KN about − 81 to − 110 m.y.) and Permo-Carboniferous (PCR about − 227 to − 313 m.y.). Less firmly established are two other quiet intervals, one in the Jurassic (JN about − 145 to − 165 m.y.), and one in the Triassic (TRN about − 205 to − 220 m.y.). Between these quiet intervals there are disturbed intervals when reversals were comparatively frequent. From − 680 to − 350 m.y. the paleomagnetic record is inadequate to delineate a succession of quiet and disturbed intervals although one is probably present. Maximum entropy spectral analysis reveals three periodicities, a dominant one at about 300 m.y. and others, less well-defined, at 113 and 57 m.y. The variations in polarity bias are compared with the paleosecular variation, and it is shown that the magnitude of the paleosecular variation is greater in disturbed than in quiet intervals. This indicates that the magnitude of paleosecular variation and polarity bias are governed by variations in the balance between non-dipole and dipole components of the field, and that these variations probably had their origin in processes near the core—mantle interface. The correspondence between the dominant periods of 300 m.y. and plate tectonics is noted and a causal relationship suggested.",""
"climate reconstructions for the last glacial maximum from a simple cirque glacier in fiordland, new zealand","2022","Mountain glacier records offer important constraints on the timing and magnitude of climate variability during the last glacial cycle. Existing moraine chronologies from the central Southern Alps indicate maximum ice extent was achieved during marine isotope stages 3–4, followed by repeated advances of similar, but gradually declining extent during marine isotope stage 2, until onset of the glacial termination. Questions remain over the precise role of climate in driving these changes, as most existing moraine chronologies come from large, complex former valley glacier systems, where non-climatic influences such as changing bed topography and proglacial lake formation may have influenced glacier length changes. Here we address this problem via a new cosmogenic 10Be chronology and equilibrium line altitude reconstruction from a cirque glacier situated in Fiordland, New Zealand. Our chronology shows moraine deposition at 32 ± 11 ka, 18.7 ± 0.2 ka, 18.1 ± 0.1 ka, and c. 17.2 ± 0.3 ka. The simple geometry of the former glacier supports the role of climate in driving a net decline of regional ice volume during marine isotope stages 3–2. Close spacing and good preservation of the 19–17 ka moraines permits 2D glacier reconstruction which suggests the equilibrium line altitude remained depressed by c.1130 m (equivalent to 5.8 ± 0.6 °C colder than present) during this interval. Onset of warming after 17.2 ± 0.2 ka is consistent with climate proxy evidence for a sustained southward shift in the southern westerly winds, which may have promoted deglaciation via shifting ocean currents and promoting increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide.","Glaciation,Pleistocene,Quaternary,Geomorphology,Southern pacific,Degree day modelling,Cosmogenic isotopes,Equilibrium line altitude,Paleoclimatology,Glacial,"
"non-satellite broadband maritime communications for e-navigation services","2021","The development of broadband network access technologies available to users on land has triggered a rapid expansion of a diverse range of services provided by terrestrial networks. However, due to limitations of digital communication technologies in the off-shore area, the maritime ICT systems evolution so far has not followed that trend. Despite the e-navigation initiative defining the set of Maritime Services, the progress in the maritime ICT systems evolution has been slow. Only a few systems, including the VHF Data Exchange System (VDES), or the TRI-Media Telematic Oceanographic Network (TRITON) have been proposed to extend the basic set of services offered by classical radio-communication solutions. However, all those systems have significant limitations. The purpose of this paper is to introduce the netBaltic system designed as a fully heterogeneous system for modern maritime communications. Its unique feature is the capability to transparently use different communication technologies to efficiently support maritime ICT services, as well as openness for the incorporation of future communication technologies. The paper presents an overview of VDES, TRITON and netBaltic systems and analysis showing their expected strengths and weaknesses. The systems are then compared in simulated environments, illustrating real-world usage scenarios based on real maritime traffic information and performance measurements obtained during off-shore measurement campaigns. Results indicate that netBaltic seems to be the most versatile one and is capable of offering access to all services defined by International Maritime Organization, due to its ability to use different communication technologies simultaneously and functionality offered by its Delay Tolerant Networking component.","international maritime organization,Safety,wireless mesh networks,broadband network access technologies,wireless communication,Organizations,Communication systems,Wireless communication,VHF data exchange system,maritime ICT services,future communication technologies,maritime ICT systems evolution,different communication technologies,satellite communication,data communication,performance measurements,terrestrial networks,Broadband communication,digital communication technologies,TRI media telematic oceanographic network,modern maritime communications,netBaltic system,maritime services,maritime traffic information,telecommunication traffic,fully heterogeneous system,marine technology,classical radio communication solution,nonsatellite broadband maritime communications,broadband networks,computer networks,marine communication,e-navigation Services,network topology,mobile communication,Navigation,Task analysis,Information and communication technology,"
"application scenarios of nautical ad-hoc network for maritime communications","2009","In terrestrial wireless communications, high data-rate transmission can be readily achieved by installing base stations on the ground. However, the same system may not be adapted to maritime communication due to the geographically restricted nature of the sea, and therefore, MF/HF modems, capable of long-distance transmission, with low data-rate are frequently employed in maritime communication. Maritime satellite communication through Inmarsat is conventionally used to compensate for the low data-rate transmission of MF/HF modems, but its high cost still remains as a main drawback. In order to enhance the transmission speed with a fairly low price, in general, a network whose architecture is similar to Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (VANET), that allows peer-to-peer communications without base stations, i.e., ad-hoc network, is crucial. Herein, we propose an ad-hoc network for nautical environment, which is named as Nautical Ad-hoc Network (NANET). In this paper, scenarios toward NANET development are described and analysis of multiple access and duplexing schemes for corresponding NANET scenarios is discussed. A guideline for further research and developmental strategies on NANET is also suggested.","Wireless communication,NANET,Peer to peer computing,ad hoc networks,Underwater communication,Marine safety,IP networks,mobile communication,Ad hoc networks,Modems,Costs,Satellite communication,marine vehicles,Base stations,peer-to-peer communications,Marine vehicles,maritime communications,nautical ad-hoc network,"
"marine ecosystems’ responses to climatic and anthropogenic forcings in the mediterranean","2011","The semi-enclosed nature of the Mediterranean Sea, together with its smaller inertia due to the relative short residence time of its water masses, make it highly reactive to external forcings, in particular variations of water, energy and matter fluxes at the interfaces. This region, which has been identified as a “hotspot” for climate change, is therefore expected to experience environmental impacts that are considerably greater than those in many other places around the world. These natural pressures interact with the increasing demographic and economic developments occurring heterogeneously in the coastal zone, making the Mediterranean even more sensitive. This review paper aims to provide a review of the state of current functioning and responses of Mediterranean marine biogeochemical cycles and ecosystems with respect to key natural and anthropogenic drivers and to consider the ecosystems’ responses to likely changes in physical, chemical and socio-economical forcings induced by global change and by growing anthropogenic pressure at the regional scale. The current knowledge on and expected changes due to single forcing (hydrodynamics, solar radiation, temperature and acidification, chemical contaminants) and combined forcing (nutrient sources and stoichiometry, extreme events) affecting the biogeochemical fluxes and ecosystem functioning are explored. Expected changes in biodiversity resulting from the combined action of the different forcings are proposed. Finally, modeling capabilities and necessity for modeling are presented. A synthesis of our current knowledge of expected changes is proposed, highlighting relevant questions for the future of the Mediterranean ecosystems that are current research priorities for the scientific community. Finally, we discuss how these priorities can be approached by national and international multi-disciplinary research, which should be implemented on several levels, including observational studies and modeling at different temporal and spatial scales.",""
"national and international maritime situational awareness model examples and the effects of north stream pipelines sabotage","2023","While many countries and international organizations with maritime security interests and rights at sea have developed new security strategies or policies in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks in the United States of America, they have accordingly changed or created new maritime security strategies or doctrines with appropriate Maritime Situational Awareness (MSA) models as well. Maritime deterioration, climate change, cyberattacks, serious and organized crime, epidemics, and state-made threats are just some of the new and growing concerns affecting maritime security. The sabotage of the Nord Stream gas pipelines in the Baltic Sea has given maritime security doctrines and frameworks a new dimension. In this article, the current maritime security approaches and maritime domain or situational awareness (MDA/MSA) model examples of some countries and international organizations from different geographic regions and also the ones that are located in the maritime choke point regions where global maritime trade routes are located and also the effects of the Nord Stream Pipelines sabotages on these are examined in light of the new threats and risks. The principle result reached in this study is that countries and international structures should have a cross governmental maritime security strategy, or at least a doctrine, in order to guide their own maritime situational awareness models and identify information sharing architectures. The most important result of the sabotages on Nord Stream Pipelines for MSA models in this study is that the fastest and most cost-effective method for protecting critical infrastructure under the seas is the concept of systems such as Mothership controlled autonomous and unmanned underwater vehicles, extra large unmanned undersea vehicles and Synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) satellites.","Maritime situational awareness,Maritime security,Maritime domain awereness,Strategy,Sabotage,"

"maritime target detection based on radar graph data and graph convolutional network","2022","Due to the complex sea clutter environment and target features, the conventional statistical theory-based methods cannot achieve high performance in maritime target detection tasks. Conventional deep learning, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs)-based target detection methods process each signal sample independently, and the temporal-spatial domain correlation information is seldom used. To achieve full utilization of information contained in radar signals and improve the detection performance, a graph convolutional network (GCN) is considered, which has shown great advantages in graph data processing and has been applied in the field of signal processing. This letter proposed a maritime target detection method based on radar signal graph data and graph convolution. Graph structure data is applied to define the detection units and to represent the temporal and spatial information of detection units. The target detection of the signal corresponding to the nodes is conducted via GCN. Experimental results show that the proposed approach can effectively detect marine targets when the signal-to-noise ratio is above âˆ’5 dB and can effectively suppress false alarms in the pure clutter area, which is not adjacent to targets. Compared with the popular used CNN method, e.g., LeNet, the proposed method can achieve higher detection probability with the same given false alarm rate.","marine radar,deep learning (artificial intelligence),signal processing,radar detection,graph data processing,radar clutter,graph convolutional network,conventional statistical theory-based methods,radar signals,Feature extraction,sea clutter,signal sampling,Manganese,deep learning,radar target detection,temporal-spatial domain correlation information,object detection,radar signal graph data,convolutional neural networks-based target detection methods,Radar,graph theory,Convolution,radar signal processing,convolutional neural nets,graph structure data,Graph convolutional network (GCN),higher detection probability,graph data,temporal information,CNN method,marine targets,maritime target detection method,Clutter,Object detection,signal-to-noise ratio,radar graph data,maritime target,Radar detection,spatial information,"
"information flow along the maritime transport chain - a simulation based approach to determine impacts of estimated time of arrival messages on the capacity utilization","2014","Various actors are involved in hinterland transportation of incoming rail containers along the maritime transport chain. To coordinate each actor's logistics processes, and therefore to improve utilization of existing transport capacity, the early provision of information, e.g. in form of estimated time of arrival (ETA), is inevitable. The objective of this paper is to determine impacts of these information flows on capacity utilization via a simulation based approach. To simulate the effect of ETA container from vessel to hinterland transport mode rail, a system dynamic simulation model is developed based on a case study about input containers at the port of Hamburg. As result the container output on rail is compared with and without ETA for different container input volumes. It will be shown; managing provision of information in supply chains - such as maritime transport chains - is a valuable approach for increasing existing utilization.","time-of-arrival estimation,supply chain management,Transportation,capacity utilization,information flow,container input volume,hinterland transportation,transportation,Cranes,system dynamic simulation model,marine systems,logistics,Containers,Bibliographies,input container,estimated time of arrival message,transport capacity,simulation based approach,supply chain,Stacking,Adaptation models,containerisation,hinterland transport mode rail,Rails,ETA container,rail container,maritime transport chain,logistics process,"
"“contextual areas” of early homo sapiens and their significance for human dispersal from africa into eurasia between 200 ka and 70 ka","2012","The African origin of our species has essentially been accepted as a scientific fact, but evolutionary advantages connected with the reasons and circumstances of modern human dispersal remain widely unexplained or controversial. Consequently, this paper provides an overview of the natural and cultural context of earliest AMH (Anatomically Modern Humans). According to the locations and dating of AMH fossils, the focus is on E-Africa, NE-Africa and the Middle East within a time range from 200 ka to 70 ka. At least three different “contextual areas” appear to have existed at the time, two of them in E-Africa and NE-Africa, dominated by “Bifacial-plus-Levallois” technology, and the third one in the Middle East, mostly connected with an “only-Levallois” technology. A comparison with some non-AMH sites from Eurasia displays similarity of technological principles between artifact assemblages from African AMH sites and Eurasian non-AMH (early Neanderthal) sites on the one hand, and dissimilarity between African AMH sites and Middle Eastern AMH sites on the other hand. This is particularly surprising if environmental contexts are taken into account – tropical in Africa and glacial in Eurasia. Thus, compared to their archaic neighbors (particularly early Neanderthals), earliest modern humans currently seem to lack any specific “cultural fingerprint” and their demographic success may not be explained by behavioral superiority alone. The idea of a small group of early AMH people migrating out of Africa, enabled by cultural superiority over their neighbors appears highly questionable in the light of archaeological evidence. Moreover, the concept of virtual “migration routes” deserves a revision if ethnodemographic evidence about spatial behavior of hunter-gatherers is taken into account. The proposed concept of “contextual areas” serves as a methodological alternative, comprising linked cultural and environmental features.","Neanderthals,migration routes,Africa,Modern Human Behavioral Package (MHBP),Middle East,Anatomically Modern Humans (AMH),"
"security of federated learning with iot systems: issues, limitations, challenges, and solutions","2023","Federated Learning (FL, or Collaborative Learning (CL)) has surely gained a reputation for not only building Machine Learning (ML) models that rely on distributed datasets, but also for starting to play a key role in security and privacy solutions to protect sensitive data and information from a variety of ML-related attacks. This made it an ideal choice for emerging networks such as Internet of Things (IoT) systems, especially with its state-of-the-art algorithms that focus on their practical use over IoT networks, despite the presence of resource-constrained devices. However, the heterogeneous nature of the current devices and models in complex IoT networks has seriously hindered the FL training process's ability to perform well. Thus, rendering it almost unsuitable for direct deployment over IoT networks despite ongoing efforts to tackle this issue and overcome this challenging obstacle. As a result, the main characteristics of FL in the IoT from both security and privacy aspects are presented in this study. We broaden our research to investigate and analyze cutting-edge FL algorithms, models, and protocols, with a focus on their efficacy and practical application across IoT networks and systems alike. This is followed by a comparative analysis of the recently available protection solutions for FL that can be based on cryptographic and non-cryptographic solutions over heterogeneous, dynamic IoT networks. Moreover, the proposed work provides a list of suggestions and recommendations that can be applied to enhance the effectiveness of the adoption of FL and to achieve higher robustness against attacks, especially in heterogeneous dynamic IoT networks and in the presence of resource-constrained devices.",""
"late holocene palaeoclimatic records from lake sediments on james ross island, antarctica","1996","Sediment profiles from several lakes/ponds in the northern, ice-free area of James Ross Island, Antarctica, were the subject of a multi-disciplinary palaeoenvironmental investigation. The results, obtained from lithological, geomagnetic, geochemical and diatom analyses, and the frequency of Branchinecta eggs, were evaluated with multivariate statistics and provide a fairly detailed picture of climate change during the last 5000 years. New radiocarbon dates are combined with previously published 14C dates, so as to date the palaeoenvironmental and palaeohydrological changes identified by the stratigraphic studies. In combination with the findings of glacial geological studies our data suggest that the Brandy Bay glacier began to recede rapidly just before 5000 yr B.P., due to calving and moisture starvation caused by cold and arid conditions. In one of the ponds studied gypsum began to precipitate as a consequence of these conditions when the influence of glacial meltwater ceased. This hypothesis was tested by hydrochemical modeling. At approximately 4200 yr B.P. the climate became more humid (and warmer) and the pond supported a fairly diverse biota, which included a variety of diatom species and, for example, Branchinecta gaini, a crustacean that feeds on benthic cyanobacterial mats. The Brandy Bay glacier probably advanced during this humid period, but the advance was interrupted by subsequent arid conditions which started at 3000 yr B.P. During this arid phase, glaciers became completely absent from the study area. As a result formerly large lakes, fed by glacial meltwater, transformed into small, enclosed, brackish water bodies that contained B. gaini. The arid and fairly cold conditions lasted for 1500–2000 years, until approximately 1200 yr B.P. when the aquatic systems expanded and their salinity was lowered as a result of increased snow accumulation and glacial expansion. The increased deposition of minerogenic matter caused by glacial erosion and meltwater inflow probably caused the disappearance of Branchinecta on James Ross Island. We regard this most recent phase as a period of increased humidity and warmth compared to the previous period, although the conditions appear to be less warm and humid than those which prevailed during the climatic optimum between 4200 and 3000 yr B.P. In spite of certain correlation problems we tentatively correlate our results to other studies of Holocene environments in Antarctica, and from that it can be suggested that the climatic optimum was of circumpolar significance. Therefore the climatic oscillations recorded in sediments on James Ross Island may reflect oscillations in the anticyclonic stormtracks and the strength of the high pressure cell over the inland ice sheet.",""
"fatigue life prediction of corrosion-damaged high-strength steel using an equivalent stress riser (esr) model: part i: test development and results","2009","The fatigue life of metallic aircraft structural components can be significantly reduced by environmentally induced corrosion. As part of a NAVAIR High Strength Steel Corrosion–Fatigue Assessment Program, methods were studied to predict the impact that corrosion-induced surface roughness has on the fatigue life of high-strength steel aircraft components. In order to adequately capture the corrosion damage features that cause fatigue cracking, a representative set of well-characterized corrosion–fatigue test results were generated to be used for model development. The test specimens fabricated for this program consisted of bare, unnotched AF1410 steel flat plates with a 25.4mm diameter corrosion patch on one side. Two sets of test specimens were fabricated and tested, with one set abrasive blasted after heat treatment, and the other set hand polished after heat treatment. A method of growing corrosion in the laboratory was developed that consisted of filter paper soaked in a 3.5% NaCl solution and placed at the center of the test plate gage section, with a voltage applied across the filter paper to accelerate corrosion growth. High-resolution 3D surface topography data was collected from the corroded region on each test plate prior to fatigue testing using a commercial white-light interference microscope. Constant-amplitude fatigue tests were performed on corroded and uncorroded test plates at several different stress levels, for three different corrosion exposure levels. Post-test fractographic analysis of the corroded specimens indicate that all of the critical cracks originated from small corrosion notches on the order of 10–200μm in width, 10–120μm in height and 2–100μm in depth. These notches were not considered to be pits in that the depth dimension was less than the surface dimensions. The repeatability of the fatigue initiating mechanism for corrosion damaged surfaces in this material indicates that it should be possible to develop a single modeling approach that reasonably captures the effects of corrosion notches in reducing fatigue life.","Corrosion fatigue,Life prediction,Notches,Probabilistic analysis,Fatigue initiation,"

However, it is also apparent that significant differences do exist which are related to geography and diet. In order to consider these differences, further improvements in the determination of elements in human tissues and fluids are required.

"maritime communications and remote voyage monitoring","2020","For ships at sea, communicating with other ships or even to land-based sites has always been a very difficult task. Around 1900, the installation of wireless communication equipment on ships began. This form of communication initially used radio waves in the MF (Medium Frequency) band. Ever since it has been undergoing various technological innovations. At present, in addition to typical terrestrial communication in the VHF band, satellite communication using microwaves is also possible. Further, these forms of data communication have replaced the telegraph and telephone. Even now, however, the speed and capacity of data communication are significantly less than that of the land-based data communication network. After reviewing the situation of maritime communication, this paper studies the data communication for autonomous navigation of ships that is currently in demand focusing on remote monitoring. It appears that few instances of obtaining verification through detailed on-board data related to real-time communication have previously been possible. That being the case, the authors posit that it is worthwhile to demonstrate the feasibility of obtaining relevant verification based on actual data via a university training vessel equipped with the latest data collection system - a system that is relatively unavailable even on new, large-scale merchant ships. Particularly for digital data, maritime communication remains mainly via relatively slow and expensive narrowband satellite transmission. Though speedier and more efficient data transfer is possible through the use of simple data compression, the costs for this mode are currently prohibitively high. It is posited that economical, speedy, and efficient data transfer via data compression will increasingly become economically available for more ships in the future.","Digital Ship,marine navigation,terrestrial communication,VHF band,latest data collection system,satellite communication,medium frequency band,data communication,ships,Remote Monitoring,Maritime Communication,economical data transfer,data compression,wireless communication equipment,history,Data Communication,marine communication,remote voyage monitoring,autonomous navigation,maritime communications,"

Palaeomagnetic measurements on other, standard-sized samples were made with a CCL ‘discrete sample’ cryogenic magnetometer. Incremental thermal and AF demagnetisation treatment was used to remove magnetic overprints and to isolate the characteristic remanent magnetisation (ChRM). A reliability classification scheme has been developed and applied in this study, to provide an objective assessment of the quality of the palaeomagnetic results. IRM acquisition experiments suggest that the dominant magnetic mineral in these sediments is magnetite, but mixtures of hematite and magnetite occur also. SEM and TEM studies of magnetic mineral extracts indicate the presence of magnetite and hematite, preserved as inclusions within silicate grains, together with abundant bacterial magnetite preserved as individual grains and chains in some samples. Samples containing the greatest proportions of bacterial magnetite generally have the highest NRM intensity. The composite magnetic polarity sequence, derived by combining the data from all three sections, is characterised by three principal magnetic polarity zones which can be correlated with geomagnetic Chrons C34n, C33r and C33n, respectively. The positions of the chron boundaries have been tied to macrofossil and nannofossil biostratigraphic zones in these sections. A series of previously undocumented short magnetic polarity sub-chrons has been identified within the longer magnetochrons. These have potential value for high-resolution stratigraphic correlations and significance for theories of geodynamo behaviour.","paleomagnetism,England,chalk,Campanian,Coniacian,magnetostratigraphy,"
"exploiting the shipping lane information for energy-efficient maritime communications","2019","Energy efficiency is a crucial issue for maritime communications, due to the high path loss and limited number of geographically available base station sites. Different from previous studies, we promote the energy efficiency by exploiting the specific characteristics of maritime channels and user mobility. Particularly, we utilize the shipping lane information of marine users to estimate their large-scale channel state information. Based on that, the resource allocation is jointly optimized for all users over all time slots during the voyage, which is a mixed 0-1 non-convex programming problem. We transform this problem into a convex one by means of variable substitution and time-sharing relaxation, and propose an iterative algorithm to solve it based on the Lagrangian dual decomposition method. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can significantly reduce the power consumption compared with existing approaches, due to the global optimization over a much larger time span by utilizing the shipping lane information.","telecommunication power management,high path loss,Channel state information,Resource management,geographically available base station sites,user mobility,marine users,energy-efficient maritime communications,large-scale channel state information,Quality of service,ships,Power demand,Maritime communications,shipping lane,shipping lane information,optimisation,Two dimensional displays,maritime channels,nonconvex programming problem,Optimization,marine communication,Transforms,resource allocation,energy efficiency,"

"exploring ais data for intelligent maritime routes extraction","2020","Maritime traffic route is the basis for the analysis of ship traffic characteristics and navigation safety. However, the spatial freedom of ship navigation makes the extraction of maritime traffic route a challenging task. In order to realize the extraction of ship traffic routes at sea, a maritime route extraction method based on ship history automatic identification system (AIS) data is proposed. In this method, the ship trajectory with rich position information is transformed into a ship trip semantic object (STSO) with semantic information, and each ship trip is abstracted as a “stop-waypoint-stop” trip object. In addition, based on the graph theory, the STSO is further integrated into the nodes and edges of a directed maritime traffic graph to realize the extraction and expression of the shipping routes. In order to prove the effectiveness of this method, the real-world AIS historical data are used for testing, and the results show that this method can effectively extract maritime traffic routes.","Automatic Identification System (AIS),Semantic trajectory,Shipping route,Maritime traffic,Graph theory,"
"time series analyses of tree ring chronologies from pacific north america: evidence for sub-century climate oscillations","1999","Tree ring-width chronologies from the west coast of North America were obtained from on-line data archives, maintained by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Data covered the period 1650–1983, for trees sampled at 43 sites between Dawson Creek, British Columbia (55°N) and Yosemite Park, CA (37°N). These time series were analyzed using Fourier transformation methods. Spyglass Transform software allowed the resulting power spectra to be stacked and compared, based on characteristics such as topography and continentality, latitude and species ecological niche. Results suggested that several regular or quasi-regular cycles are occurring over various time periods. There are some similarities, though not an exact match, with El Niño periodicities noted by earlier authors. These patterns appear to be widespread, affecting trees at various elevations and distances from the coast, and from different species. A separate analysis of the oldest trees revealed sub-century cycles. In particular, the longer fluctuations at 50–65 years are consistent with recent findings on north Pacific climate by other authors. A Euclidean cluster analysis of individual years identified unusual year groupings between 1924–1946, a period associated with positive temperature anomalies and generally higher precipitation. These findings appear to be consistent with other basin-scale climate cycles, like the Southern Oscillation, and the recently-proposed Pacific Interdecadal Oscillation (PDO).","Power spectra,El Niño,Pacific basin,Dendrochronology,Tree rings,Pacific Interdecadal Oscillation,Climate oscillations,"
"survey of the seikan tunnel","1986","Surveys on the Seikan Tunnel began in 1946. Survey items included a detailed geological survey of the land on both the Honshu and Hokkaido sides; the creation of an undersea topographical map based on echo sounding techniques; and a general study of the geological structure of the undersea portion, carried out by seismic prospecting. A detailed undersea geological map has been edited chiefly by dredging and sonic prospecting. Carrying out offshore survey proved rather difficult, however, due to the water depth in the Tsugaru Straits, the fast tidal currents and the adverse weather conditions. Nonetheless, the results of the survey generally agreed with the actual geological conditions in terms of geographical formation sequence, major structure distribution, etc. In addition, the survey results were particularly effective in presenting the major geological features of primary importance, while greatly assisting in choosing the most appropriate design and construction work that followed.

"a new efficient wave model for maritime training simulator","2001","The market for maritime training simulators is as important as the market for aeronautical training simulators. Many maritime accidents are caused by piloting errors in critical situations. Such situations are usually due to the environment (waves and streams). Hence, the main challenge of a maritime simulator is to simulate this environment as accurately as possible and, more precisely, to simulate ocean waves. Nowadays, two kinds of wave simulation theories are being presented. Firstly, accurate models are being created by physicists, while in computer graphics, researchers are putting forward some simpler physically-based models in order to produce static photorealistic images. This paper describes a new, efficient, real-time model of wave propagation and shows its integration in a real maritime simulator.","Aerospace simulation,piloting errors,streams,digital simulation,naval engineering computing,computer graphics,Marine vehicles,critical situations,efficient wave model,Ocean waves,maritime training simulator,Sonar navigation,marine systems,ocean waves,Computer graphics,realistic images,Accidents,real-time systems,computer based training,physically-based models,engineering graphics,static photorealistic images,environment,Instruments,wave propagation,real-time model,Computational modeling,maritime accidents,wave simulation theories,Layout,accidents,Marine animals,"
"mediterranean tropical-like cyclones: impacts and composite daily means and anomalies of synoptic patterns","2018","In the Mediterranean region, a rapidly rotating storm system characterized by gale winds, severe precipitation, and low pressure center, accompanied with a spiral pattern of thunderstorms, is occasionally observed. These tropical-like cyclones (TLC), known as Medicanes or Mediterranean ‘hurricanes’, have similar characteristics with hurricanes and a significant amount of research has been done in recent years to investigate their atmospheric characteristics and impacts. The Laboratory of Climatology and Atmospheric Environment (LACAE), National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, has established a systematic effort since 2009, to document the impact of severe atmospheric phenomena (e.g. medicanes, cyclones, tornadoes, waterspouts), especially over the eastern Mediterranean region. The objective of this study is to discuss on one hand, the intra annual and inter annual distribution of medicanes along with the composite daily means and anomalies of synoptic conditions and instability indices at the middle and lower troposphere, sea level pressure (SLP) and sea surface temperature (SST) as well, during medicane days, based on the National Centers for Environmental Prediction-National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP-NCAR) reanalysis data sets. On the other hand, the geographical distribution of medicane impacts over Mediterranean region with respect to period from 1969 to 2014, is illustrated by utilizing the Geographic Information Systems (GIS). The findings shed light on the high activity of medicanes during autumn and winter with maxima in September, decreasing thereafter with a long tail extending in spring and minimizing in summer. The average number of the selected medicanes is 1.4±1.3 events per year while their inter-annual variability is remarkable, although there is not any statistically significant trend (95% confidence level) within the examined period. We found from the analysis of the composite daily anomalies of the synoptic conditions that medicanes initiate and further develop in Mediterranean regions where cold air intrusions appear in the upper atmosphere associated with warm sea waters. Last but not least, the impacts of medicanes over coastal areas, including infrastructure damage and casualties due to associated strong winds, heavy rainfall, and in rare cases, tornadoes, are well presented, indicating the high concern of such extreme atmospheric phenomena should be given by stake holders towards resilience of the society.","Tropical-like cyclones,Medicanes,Mediterranean,NCEP-NCAR reanalysis,Composite means and anomalies,Impacts,"
"a contextual hybrid model for vessel movement prediction","2021","Predicting the movement of the vessels can significantly improve the management of safety. While the movement can be a function of geographic contexts, the current systems and methods rarely incorporate contextual information into the analysis. This paper initially proposes a novel context-aware trajectoriesâ€™ simplification method to embed the effects of geographic context which guarantees the logical consistency of the compressed trajectories, and further suggests a hybrid method that is built upon a curvilinear model and deep neural networks. The proposed method employs contextual information to check the logical consistency of the curvilinear method and then, constructs a Context-aware Long Short-Term Memory (CLSTM) network that can take into account contextual variables, such as the vessel types. The proposed method can enhance the prediction accuracy while maintaining the logical consistency, through a recursive feedback loop. The implementations of the proposed approach on the Automatic Identification System (AIS) dataset, from the eastern coast of the United States of America which was collected, from November to December 2017, demonstrates the effectiveness and better compression, i.e. 80% compression ratio while maintaining the logical consistency. The estimated compressed trajectories are 23% more similar to their original trajectories compared to currently used simplification methods. Furthermore, the overall accuracy of the implemented hybrid method is 15.68% higher than the ordinary Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network which is currently used by various maritime systems and applications, including collision avoidance, vessel route planning, and anomaly detection systems.","recurrent neural nets,Safety,deep learning (artificial intelligence),Mathematical model,safety management,movement prediction,AIS dataset,Predictive models,curvilinear method,ubiquitous computing,deep neural networks,CLSTM network,ship behavior,deep learning,ships,automatic identification system dataset,marine safety,marine engineering,Data models,contextual hybrid model,contextual information,vessel movement prediction,United States of America,geographic context,data compression,Automatic identification system,vessel types,Trajectory,compressed trajectory estimation,context-aware LSTM network,vessel route planning,Deep learning,Context modeling,context-aware long short-term memory network,logical consistency,context-aware trajectories simplification,"

The lidar is embedded on an ultra-light aircraft. The choice of the Landes forest in southwestern France as study area was made regarding the flat topography of the area and the stand height consistency. We chose three plots from different stands (different height characteristics) and compared the lidar derived metries to field measurements. To derive metries from lidar data, we summed the lidar waveforms within a plot and calculated derived reflectance profiles to correct the lidar signal from the occlusion effect. We then retrieve plot mean total and mean crown base heights measurement from reflectance profiles. We obtain a good consistency of the lidar measurements compared to field measurements, even if we noticed the existence of a 5 to 10% bias probably linked to the lidar sampling strategy.","crown height,vegetation mapping,maritime pine forest,sampling methods,topography (Earth),signal analysis,Landes forest,ultralight aircraft,tree height,lidar,optical radar,lidar data,Decision support systems,height measurement,southwestern France,forestry,remote sensing by radar,topography,aerosols,fullwaveform ultraviolet lidar prototype,"
"potential hot spots contaminated with exogenous, rare earth elements originating from e-waste dismantling and recycling","2022","Dismantling and recycling e-waste has been recognized as a potential emission source of rare earth elements (REEs). However, the presence of REEs in typical regional soils has yet to be studied. Given the potential health implications of such soil contamination, it is vital to study the characteristics, spatial distribution, and pollution level of REEs caused by e-waste dismantling as well as determine the influencing mechanism. This study focused on Guiyu Town as an example site, which is a typical e-waste dismantling base. From the site, 39 topsoil samples of different types were collected according to grid distribution points. Soil profiles were also collected in the dismantling and non-dismantling areas. The REE characteristic parameters showed that the REE distribution was abnormal and was affected by multiple factors. The results of the integrated pollution index showed that approximately 61.5% of soil samples were considered to be lightly polluted. Spatial distribution and correlation analysis showed that hot spots of REE-polluted soil coincided with known, main pollution sources. Moreover, there was a significant negative correlation (p ≤0.05) between the REE concentration and the distance from the pollution source. E-waste disassembly and recycling greatly affect the physical and chemical properties of the surrounding soil as well as downward migration areas. In the disassembly area, REE accumulated more easily in the surface layer (0–20 cm). Geographical detector results showed that distance factor was the main contribution factor for both light rare earth elements (LREE) and heavy rare earth element (HREE) (q = 34.59% and 53.33%, respectively). REE distribution in soil was nonlinear enhanced by different factors. Taken together, these results showed that e-waste disassembling and recycling not only directly affected the spatial distribution of REEs, but that their distribution was also affected by land use type and soil properties.","Influencing mechanism,Hot spot,E-waste,Anthropogenic REE,Factor contribution,"
"intelligent anomaly detection of trajectories for iot empowered maritime transportation systems","2023","The convergence of Maritime Transportation Systems (MTS) and Internet of Things (IoT) has led to the promising IoT-empowered MTS (IoT-MTS). However, abnormal trajectories of maritime transportation ships can have highly negative impacts on the management of IoT-MTS. Therefore, anomaly detection of trajectories is important for the successful deployment of IoT-MTS. In this paper, we propose a Transfer Learning based Trajectory Anomaly Detection strategy, named TLTAD, for IoT-MTS. Specifically, a variational autoencoder is used to discover the potential connections between each dimension of the normal trajectory, while a graph variational autoencoder is used to explore the spatial similarity between normal trajectories. Based on internal connection of trajectories, a deep reinforcement learning algorithm, Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic policy gradient (TD3), is employed to train the trajectory anomaly detection model. To reduce the model training time, transfer learning is used to migrate the trained anomaly detection model between different regions of an ocean area or between similar ocean areas. Moreover, an efficient data transformation module is designed to improve the efficiency of model transfer. The experiments were conducted on a real-world automatic identification system (AIS) dataset. The results indicate that the proposed TLTAD can provide accurate anomaly detection on shipsâ€™ trajectories in IoT-MTS with reduced model training times.","reduced model training times,Transportation,deep learning (artificial intelligence),Anomaly detection,maritime transportation systems,anomaly detection,Internet of Things,transportation,Marine vehicles,abnormal trajectories,Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic policy gradient,highly negative impacts,model training time,ships,IoT-MTS,trajectory anomaly detection model,deep reinforcement learning algorithm,Data models,normal trajectory,reinforcement learning,maritime transportation ships,Artificial intelligence,real-world automatic identification system dataset,Maritime Transportation Systems,graph variational autoencoder,trained anomaly detection model,Trajectory Anomaly Detection strategy,gradient methods,Deep reinforcement learning,model transfer,Trajectory,promising IoT-empowered MTS,intelligent Anomaly Detection,transfer learning,learning (artificial intelligence),data handling,Analytical models,"
"lte-maritime: high-speed maritime wireless communication based on lte technology","2019","The recent advances in wireless communication technologies allow mobile users to access various data services anytime and anywhere on land, while it is one of challenging issues to provide reliable data communications for maritime users due to the geographic features on the sea.

"passive microwave remote and in situ measurements of artic and subarctic snow covers in alaska","1991","Between 11 and 19 March 1988, airborne and satellite passive microwave measurements were acquired simultaneously with ground measurements of depth, density and stratigraphy of the snow in central and northern Alaska. Five aircraft flights were flown along a north-south transect between about 147 ° W and 152 ° W, and extending from about 63° N (south of Fairbanks, Alaska) to the Arctic Ocean coastline, with an Aircraft Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (AMMR) on-board operating at 92 GHz, 37 GHz, 21 GHz, and 18 GHz. Passive microwave data from the satellite-borne Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSMI), operating at 85.5 GHz, 37 GHz, 21 GHz, 18 GHz, and 10 GHz, were obtained concurrently. A good correspondence in brightness temperature (TB) trends between the aircraft and satellite data was found. However, an expected inverse correlation between depth hoar thickness and TB was not found to be strong. A persistent TB minimum in both the aircraft and the satellite data was detected along the northern foothills of the Brooks Range. In an area located at about 68° 50'N, 149° 20'W, the TB as recorded from the aircraft microwave sensor dropped by 55 K. Satellite microwave measurements showed a TB decrease of up to 45 K at approximately the same location. Snow pit measurements did not reveal notable differences in snow characteristics or depth in this location. An examination of passive microwave satellite data from 1978 to 1987 revealed that similar low latewinter TB values were found in approximately the same locations as those observed in March 1988. According to the satellite data, the zone of low TB develops as the snow deepens, and reaches the lowest values in March or April each year. The cause of this TB minimum is unknown but thought to be related to snow stratigraphy. The observed difficulty in relating the ground measurements to data collected using aircraft and satellite passive microwave sensors is attributed to the fact that the snow depth and character are highly variable in central and northern Alaska. This variability is exemplified in the field measurements as well as in the passive microwave measurements.",""

"long-term observation of global nuclear power plants thermal plumes using landsat images and deep learning","2023","Thermal discharge from nuclear power plants poses a threat to the received natural water bodies, but the long-term extent and intensity of their surface thermal plumes remain unclear. In this study, we proposed a method to determine the background area for each drainage outlet and delineate the mixed surface thermal plumes based on 7,172 Landsat thermal infrared images. We further used a deep convolutional neural network integrated with prior location knowledge to extract core surface thermal plumes for 74 drainage outlets of 66 nuclear power plants worldwide. Our final model achieved a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 0.8998 and an F1 score of 0.8886. We found that the mean maximal water surface temperature (WST) increment of the studied plants globally was 4.80 K. The Tianwan plant in China experienced the highest WST increase (8.51 K), followed by the Gravelines plant in France and the Ohi plant in Japan (7.91 K and 7.71 K, respectively). The Bruce plant in Canada had the largest thermal-polluted surface area (7.22 km2). We also provided the dataset, Global Coastal Nuclear power plant Thermal Plume (GCNT-Plume), to describe the long-term occurrence of water surface thermal plumes. Three influencing factors of the water surface thermal plume were further analyzed in this study, including total capacity, drainage type, and location type, which were associated with operating power, drainage method, and geographical features, respectively. Total capacity was more statistically related to the maximum of WST increment under shallow drainage condition. The mean WST increment of shallow drainage was 1.22 K higher than that of deep drainage. Surface plumes larger than 4 km2 frequently occurred in the Great Lakes, while small surface thermal plumes (< 1 km2) were primarily found in estuaries. The proposed method provides an important framework for future operational water surface thermal plume detection using remotely sensed observations and deep learning.","Landsat,WST,Surface thermal plume,Deep learning,Thermal infrared remote sensing,Nuclear power plants,"

It features a wide range of temporal and spatial scales (basin, sub-basin and mesoscale, with the latter being the focus of this chapter) that interact to force a complex, highly variable general circulation. Over recent decades many oceanographic campaigns have been carried out across the Mediterranean, supported by progressively improving satellite observations (e.g., sea surface height derived from altimetry and chlorophyll concentration), with the goal of further understanding the processes and mechanisms at play. These missions typically sample sharp fronts and mesoscale eddies. More recently, these multiplatform experiments are being complemented with even wider ranges of instruments, such as gliders, drifters, underway CTDs and ADCPs. These advanced instruments enable a look beyond the mesoscale and into the submesoscale.

From various standpoints, it appears that maritime satellite systems are more desirable than conventional (nontelex) marine telegraph/telephone. In addition, the improved performance, capability, and potential of satellites could outweigh the slightly lower annual traffic and equipment cost for HF marine telex.","Telegraphy,Oceans,Telephony,Marine-vehicle navigation,Satellite navigation systems,Satellite broadcasting,Communication industry,multiaccess,Costs,Satellite communication,Radio navigation position measurement,Marine vehicles,Shipbuilding industry,Marine-vehicle communication,Government,"
"cetacean occurrence and spatial distribution: habitat modelling for offshore waters in the portuguese eez (ne atlantic)","2015","In the Portuguese Economic Exclusive Zone (EEZ) (NE Atlantic), little survey effort dedicated to cetacean species has been carried out in offshore waters. As a consequence, data on their occurrence, distribution and habitat preferences is scarce. In this area, 48 sea surveys along fixed transects within Continental Portugal and Madeira Island were performed in 2012 and 2013, from July to October, using platforms of opportunity. We used an environmental envelope approach and GAM habitat models to identify the role of oceanographic, topographic and geographical variables in shaping cetacean distribution. Results demonstrate the richness of offshore waters in this area as in 10,668nmi sampled, we recorded 218 sightings from at least nine cetacean species, resulting in an overall ER of 2.04 sightings/100nmi. The interaction of topographic and oceanographic features was shown to influence the distribution of the species/groups along the routes. Among the sighted species, only common dolphin showed a preference for coastal waters, while for all the other species high seas proved to be determinant. This result reinforces the need to address conservation issues in open ocean. This preliminary assessment showed the importance of the entire area for the distribution of different cetacean species and allowed the identification of several species/group specific potential suitable habitats. Considering the Habitats Directive resolutions, ACCOBAMS priorities, EEZ extension for the area and Maritime Spatial Planning Directive, and the urgent need for management plans, we suggest that the sampling strategy here presented is a cost-effective method to gather valuable data, to be used to improve cetacean habitat models in the area.","Management,Cetacean distribution,Portuguese EEZ,High seas,Habitat modelling,"
"measurements within the pacific-indian oceans throughflow region","1994","Two hydrographic (θ, S, O2) and trichlorofluoromethane (F-11) sections were carried out between the Australian continental shelf and Indonesia, in August 1989, on board the R.V. Marion Dufresne. The sections lie in the easternmost part of the Indian Ocean where the throughflow between the Pacific Ocean and the Indian Ocean emerges. They allow us to describe the features of the water-property and circulation fields of the throughflow at its entrance in the Indian Ocean. Between the Australian continental shelf and Bali, the Subtropical and Central waters are separated from the waters of the Indonesian seas by a sharp hydrological front, located around 13°30 S, below the thermocline down to 700 m. Near the coast of Bali, upwelling occurs in the near-surface layer under the effect of the southeast monsoon; at depth, between 300 m to more than 800 m, a water mass of northern Indian Ocean origin was present. From the characteristics of the bottom water found in the Lombok basin, the maximum depth of the Java ridge which separates the Lombok basin from the Northwest Australian basin lies around 3650 m. Off Sumba, Savu, Roti and Timor channels a core of low salinity and high oxygen content near-surface water was found in the axis of each channel, which suggests strong currents from the interior Indonesian seas towards the Indian Ocean. The entrance of the deep water flowing in the opposite direction, from the Indian Ocean to the Timor basin, was marked below 1400 m to the sill depth, through an increase of salinity and oxygen content. The flow reversal, observed briefly by a Pegasus direct current profiler in the Timor strait, was located at 1200 m depth. During the southeast monsoon, the net (geostrophic + Ekman) transport calculated on the section Australia-Bali give an estimate of the throughflow between 0 and 500 m of 22 ± 4 × 106 m3 s−1 towards the Indian Ocean, with a concentration of the transport in the upper layers (19 × 106 m3 s−1 in 0–200 m) and near the Indonesian coast, north of 13°30 S. In this region of intense mixing, attempts to make a salinity budget were inconclusive but did not imply any reduction in estimated throughflow transport. Below 500 m the net transport is of the order of the uncertainty. The total estimated transport (0–1900 dbar, deepest sill depth) is 18.6 × 106 m3 s−1 (±7) with a mean temperature of 23°C and a mean salinity of 34.0 psu (but may be as large as 23 × 106 m3 s−1, with mean temperature of 20°C and mean salinity of 34.1 psu).",""
"multi-objective path optimization method for maritime drones","2023","In this paper, based on graph theory and multi-objective optimization theory, the trajectory planning problem of maritime drones is studied. A mathematical model is established using directed graphs, with the objectives of minimizing the trajectory length and the number of corrections. Different from previous algorithms, this paper refers to the idea of the A-star algorithm and combines dynamic labeling and non-dominated sorting strategies to propose an efficient heuristic algorithm: the multi-objective path planning algorithm based on forward labels. The result of this algorithm is a set of Pareto optimal solutions, which require further selection using an ideal point-based best compromise solution method to obtain the best compromise plan. In addition, this paper conducts a comparative study with the NSGA-II algorithm, verifying the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed algorithm.

"leveraging graph and deep learning uncertainties to detect anomalous maritime trajectories","2022","Understanding and representing traffic patterns are key to detecting anomalous trajectories in the transportation domain. However, some trajectories can exhibit heterogeneous maneuvering characteristics despite confining to normal patterns. Thus, we propose a novel graph-based trajectory representation and association scheme for extraction and confederation of traffic movement patterns, such that data patterns and uncertainty can be learned by deep learning (DL) models. This paper proposes the usage of a recurrent neural network (RNN)-based evidential regression model, which can predict trajectory at future timesteps as well as estimate the data and model uncertainties associated, to detect anomalous maritime trajectories, such as unusual vessel maneuvering, using automatic identification system (AIS) data. Furthermore, we utilize evidential deep learning classifiers to detect unusual turns of vessels and the loss of transmitted signal using predicted class probabilities with associated uncertainties. Our experimental results suggest that the graphical representation of traffic patterns improves the ability of the DL models, such as evidential and Monte Carlo dropout, to learn the temporal-spatial correlation of data and associated uncertainties. Using different datasets and experiments, we demonstrate that the estimated prediction uncertainty yields fundamental information for the detection of traffic anomalies in the maritime and, possibly in other domains.","Monte Carlo methods,classification,recurrent neural nets,graph,deep learning (artificial intelligence),Anomaly detection,DL models,graph-based trajectory representation,automatic identification system data,Monte Carlo dropout,graphical representation,traffic movement patterns,detect anomalous maritime trajectories,Predictive models,regression analysis,evidential deep learning,marine engineering,Data models,data patterns,pattern classification,Artificial intelligence,graph theory,RNN,regression,clustering,uncertainty,Trajectory,Uncertainty,probability,Computational modeling,traffic engineering computing,recurrent neural network-based evidential regression model,deep learning uncertainties,AIS data,"

"climatic variability in humid africa along the gulf of guinea part ii: an integrated regional approach","1997","The analysis presented here deals with the annual precipitation levels and the number of rainy days a year as observed in several countries located along the Gulf of Guinea (Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana, Togo, Bénin, Nigeria) during the decades from the 1950s to the 1980s. The study is based on a set of methods used both for the interpolation and the cartographic representation of the results as well as on statistical methods for the detection of breaks in the time series. It is possible through them to underscore a climatic variability at the regional level at the end of the 1960s and at the beginning of the 1970s, with, however, an important variability in space of the intensity of the phenomenon. The conclusions drawn previously from the study conducted on Côte d'Ivoire do not constitute a unique case. Generally speaking, it can be asserted that the whole region of humid west Africa was affected by a climatic accident that is comparable and in line with what was observed further to the north, in the Sahelian region.",""
"upper mississippi pb as a mid-1800s chronostratigraphic marker in sediments from seasonally anoxic lakes in eastern canada","2013","Sediment cores from eight headwater lakes located in Southern Québec, Eastern Canada, were analyzed for Pb, stable Pb isotopes, and the radioelements 210Pb, 137Cs, 241Am and 226Ra. The depth profiles of stable Pb isotope ratios show, for the post-19th century period, the influence of several isotopically distinct anthropogenic lead sources, mainly including emissions from two Canadian smelters and from leaded gasoline combustion in Canada and in the United States. A most interesting feature of the profiles, however, is the presence of sharp stable Pb isotope ratio peaks near the depth horizon, where excess 210Pb becomes undetectable. Using a binary mixing model and assuming that natural Pb concentrations and isotopic compositions from the catchment are given by the pre-industrial sediments at the bottom of the cores, we find that a significant part of the anthropogenic Pb supplied to the sediments at this horizon originated from smelting activities in the Upper Mississippi Valley. We assess that the Pb isotope ratio peaks, also observed in the laminated sediments of the Pettaquamscutt Estuary, Rhode Island, USA, are an accurate chronostratigraphic marker for the validation of mid-19th century 210Pb-derived dates. Given that the study lakes are located up to 2000km from the Mississippi Valley, we conclude that this isotopic Pb signal provides a widely distributed time-marker that is key to validate 210Pb chronologies in environmental archives from Eastern North America.",""
"subterranea: notes on the notion of a geopolitical unconscious","2022","New technologies are increasingly making it possible to colonize and inhabit realms previously deemed beyond-the-human. While airspace and maritime spaces feature particularly prominently in these larger geopolitical formations, subterranean spaces have not elicited the same levels of dynamism, anxiety, or excitement. Unlike air or water, subterranean spaces are often imagined to be static and inhibitive of movement, and are therefore less amenable to geopolitical mobilizations. Focusing precisely on this absence, the paper will look at the subterranean as spatial metaphor for what remains unspoken, unexplored, or forcibly repressed in geopolitical narratives. In doing so, the argument will touch upon nonhuman geographies, insularity, and the “monstrous” through two examples of subterranean sites, namely the UK/France Channel Tunnel and the Korean DMZ.","Unconscious,Cutaneity,Monsters,Tunnels,Concorporate,Geopolitics,"

"a ten-year analysis of cloud-to-ground lightning activity over the eastern mediterranean region","2015","Lightning activity is analysed in a sector covering the Eastern Mediterranean (16–32°E, 34–46°N) for the years 2005–2014. The study is based on the use of cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning activity data retrieved from ZEUS system, operated by the National Observatory of Athens, and examines the seasonal, diurnal and spatial variability of the lightning activity. The effect of elevation, terrain slope, vegetation cover and convective available potential energy (CAPE) on the distribution of the CG lightning strokes is also investigated. Lightning is modulated by the diurnal cycle of insolation and the underlying topographic features of the region. The lightning strokes are more numerous over the mainland than over the sea. CG lightning activity is dominant over the land and the coastal areas during spring and summer while during the coldest period of the year it is dominant over the sea. The maximum value of lightning activity is observed in June and mostly in the afternoon. The orography and the terrain slope affect the distribution of lightning. During the warmest period of the year, the forested areas have an increased “lightning yield”. The number of CG lightning strokes increases with increasing CAPE and the high correlation between them indicates that CAPE values could be used as a proxy for the presence of lightning activity, at least over the eastern Mediterranean region.","Vegetation cover,Topographic features,Lightning climatology,Eastern Mediterranean,CAPE,"
"ship path optimization that accounts for geographical traffic characteristics to increase maritime port safety","2022","Maritime ports face challenges associated with navigation safety, operational efficiency, and management. With the development of the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence simulation technologies, geographical information systems, and cloud computing technologies as well as navigation aids and decision support systems in maritime transportation, ports have the potential to better manage traffic, loading, and unloading. Recently, there has been growing attention in unmanned shipping to support the maritime industry and the military. This paper aims to extend the application of geographical theory and methodology in unmanned ship path optimization. Automatic collision avoidance concerning maneuvering capabilities of ships as well as complying with maritime traffic rules remains a challenge. This study attempts to tackle development needs associated with path optimization in maritime travel. By integrating ship movement behavior, geographical features, and the International Regulations for Avoiding Collisions at Sea, the proposed methods seek to reduce the human error associated with maritime accidents.

"assessment of the resilience of a complex network for crude oil transportation on the maritime silk road","2020","As one of the most strategically important natural resources, crude oil can be dangerous to transport by sea. The resilience of a maritime transport network denotes the ability of the system to withstand damage and remain operational after disturbances, representing the invulnerability of the network and its ability to recover from harm. In this study, we built a crude oil transportation network titled the Maritime Silk Road using Automatic Identification System (AIS) sensor data, designed a resilience assessment framework based on complex network theory, and assessed the resilience of the maritime crude oil transportation network from both qualitative and quantitative perspectives with the help of complex network metrics and a resilience model. The results show that the topology of the crude oil transportation network has a significant impact on its resilience, in that network density and centrality are negatively related to network resilience, whereas network connectivity and size are positively related to resilience. Subsequently, the resilience of crude oil transportation networks declines at a steady rate under random attacks but declines sharply under intentional attacks. Finally, a comprehensive analysis of invulnerability and recovery in the context of resilience concludes that strengthening small and medium-sized ports in the network is important to enhance network resilience. These results can provide reference and decision support for port planning, route design, optimization, and form a foundation for a more secure and reliable maritime transportation network system.","resilience assessment framework,Safety,maritime transport network,crude oil transportation network,complex network metrics,goods distribution,network resilience,Resilience,Maritime Silk Road,complex network theory,reliable maritime transportation network system,complex network,Oils,network connectivity,secure maritime transportation network system,network theory (graphs),Complex networks,Artificial intelligence,sea ports,crude oil,network density,Roads,maritime crude oil transportation network,mathematical analysis,petroleum industry,complex networks,AIS data,maritime silk road,"
"maritime containers tracking trial results","2009","There are approximately 7 million maritime-style containers within Canada, and 70 million within the US. The interiors of such containers are rarely inspected. With market globalization, a large amount of these containers enter North America on a daily basis. Such containers may include contraband or dangerous items that present an economic or security risk. Despite significant security improvements, only 3 to 5 % of the maritime containers, that arrive in, or transition through, North America, go through physical inspection. Current container tracking technologies based on GPS consume high DC power, are costly, require line-of-sight with satellites, and are often too large to be covert. It is possible to overcome some of these limitations by basing the tracking system on the FM broadcast signal which is an alternative man-made signal that is reasonably ubiquitous, provides a geographically-unique frequency spectrum and is about 100,000 times as strong as a GPS satellite signal. This allows the development of a low-cost, low-power and miniature FM receiver that can record frequency spectrums and compare them to known data in order to trace the path that the container has taken for less than $10 per container. This presents the first results of highway trials (train and sea trials are currently being conducted) of such a low-cost, covert, non-GPS based technology (called 'FM Tag') that records the worldwide displacement of containers and displays the path undertaken by the container while in transit. As an added security benefit, the tag is also capable of detecting container door openings. In addition to presenting the first trial results, this covers the innovative engineering aspects of using the metal enclosure of a maritime container as a VBF antenna, thereby eliminating the need to add an external antenna and achieving the goal of being 100% covert.","maritime containers tracking,US,Inspection,Canada,VHF antennas,Global Positioning System,FM broadcast signal,metal enclosure,Containers,Globalization,frequency spectrum,containers,market globalization,GPS,Satellite broadcasting,North America,Frequency,Road transportation,container tracking technologies,VHP antenna,Power generation economics,Security,"
"cancerous diseases in aquatic animals and their association with environmental pollutants: a critical literature review","1986","This review of the literature on neoplastic or cancer-like disorders in fish and shellfish sets out to (1) summarize what is known of the occurrence of neoplastic diseases in indigenous populations of aquatic animals found in different geographic areas of the world; (2) critically evaluate existing reports so as to determine whether or not environmental pollutants are implicated as causal agents of the cellular disorders and (3) describe the current state of knowledge in the general areas of fish and shellfish metabolism and the use of aquatic animal models in studies of chemical carcinogenesis. Tumors and neoplasms have been described in fish and shellfish populations from many areas throughout the world. Although environmental pollutants have been suggested as the cause of neoplasms in at least some cases, the existing evidence does not permit a firm conclusion. For fish, the quality of the reports and data reviewed varied considerably. There are rather good experimental data to suggest that cancer-like conditions in fish from certain areas of Puget Sound (Washington), the Fox River (Illinois) and Japan are associated with chemical contaminants in the environment. The data purported to support a chemical etiology for highly publicized tumors in fish from the Buffalo River, Torch Lake and Black River are not of a high quality. Most of the studies from those areas are compromised by inadequate experimental designs, and further research will be necessary to achieve a more complete in relation to the existence of tumors in fish from those areas. There are also reports providing impressive evidence that chemical pollutants are not associated with neoplasms in fish, even in those inhibiting environments known to contain mutagenic substances. Large surveys conducted from highly polluted aquatic systems in Yugoslavia (Sava River), Germany (Rhine and Elbe Rivers) and Australia (Port Phillip Bay) all reported negative results. Many other studies and surveys have produced data that neither supported nor refuted a pollution-neoplasm association. In contrast to fish, there is little evidence that neoplasms of clams, oysters and mussels are associated in any significant way with environmental pollution. The most obvious conclusion, from reviewing the existing literature, is that much additional research is required before the relationship(s) between environmental pollution and neoplasms in indigenous aquatic species can be understood. There are severe constraints associated with conducting credible field studies in this area, given the incalculable number of variables in natural environments. In the future, it may be advisable to place more emphasis on laboratory studies employing state-of-the-art methods to provide fundamental information that can be used to understand the nature and causes of neoplasms in aquatic species.",""

"coastal engineering applications of high-resolution lidar bathymetry","1998","In 1994, the US Army Corps of Engineers completed development of the Scanning Hydrographic Operational Airborne Lidar Survey (SHOALS) system, a state-of-the-art hydrographic survey instrument. Using lidar (Light Detection And Ranging) technology and operating from a Bell 212 helicopter, SHOALS remotely collects accurate, high-resolution bathymetry at a rate of 8 km2/h. A nominal depth-and-position measurement spacing of 4 m yields high-density bottom coverage of coastal projects, producing soundings from the above-water beach, or coastal structure, to depths of 40 m. Since becoming fully operational, SHOALS surveyed over 2000 km2 along the Atlantic Ocean, Pacific Ocean, Gulf of Mexico, Great Lakes, and Caribbean Sea. Survey projects varied from tidal inlets and navigation channels to beach nourishment and monitoring. These projects quantify current coastal structure condition, navigation channel alignments, and morphologic changes over time. In addition to monitoring coastal projects, sediment transport can be estimated with accurate, high-resolution bathymetry. Bathymetry can be translated into sediment transport through a combination of the sediment continuity equation, a surf zone energetics-based longshore transport formula, and bathymetric data. This paper presents the SHOALS system describing both lidar technology and the survey system. Several SHOALS data sets are presented to show today's benefits of high-resolution lidar bathymetry to the coastal engineering community. Finally, ongoing research using these unique data sets is presented to show the future benefits of lidar bathymetry to the coastal field.","Bathymetry,Sediment transport,Scanning Hydrographic Operational Airborne Lidar Survey system,"
"high resolution-optical tomography for in-process layerwise monitoring of a laser-powder bed fusion technology","2022","With the implementation of Laser Powder Bed Fusion technologies for industrial production, the need for in-process monitoring has emerged to ensure stable conditions and the process to succeed. Indeed, despite significant technological advances, the rejected parts are still too high if compared to the more conventional manufacturing techniques. Several defects are known to affect the process, more likely when complex geometries are fabricated. Among these, the production of inclined thin walls without support structures is still critical and, in most cases, geometric distortions are observed on the overhanging surfaces. In order to overcome the above mentioned problems and improve the quality of these critical structures, an high resolution monitoring system based on Optical Tomography (OT) was proposed, called High Resolution-Optical Tomography (HR-OT). It uses a very high-resolution sensor, operating in the visible spectrum of light, on a large area of the surface layers comprising the entire printing platform. This very recent technique, typically applied for the detection of volumetric defects, such as porosity or lack of fusion, was successfully applied, in this paper, for the detection of geometric distortions, allowing to avoid onerous pre-processing phases in the image processing workflow. Specific geometric indexes were selected as monitoring outputs and were used for the construction of appropriate control charts in order to carry out statistical process monitoring. Finally, an off-line 3D reconstruction, by means of digital close range photogrammetry, was used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed monitoring solution when applied for in-process detection of geometric distortions.","In-process monitoring,Photogrammetry,AISI 316L,Laser-powder bed fusion,High resolution-optical tomography,"
"recent geomorphological evolution of channel bar in magdalena river (colombia) due to natural and anthropogenic interferences","2022","The growing establishment of port structures in estuarine regions has resulted in alternated sedimentation patterns and new geoforms. The primary purpose of this study is to understand the recent formation and geomorphological evolution of the fluvial bar in the final portion of the Magdalena River. The geomorphological evolution analysis was made possible using Geographic Information Systems tools, satellite images, and bathymetric data. The studied bar formed and stabilized through anthropic and natural factors such as port structures (obstacles to sediment transport), channel morphology, and natural- and anthropic-caused variation to the sediment supply. The lateral bar formation, adjacent to port structures, began in 2017 with surface runoff accumulating and anchored on the riverbank since 2018. At present, the bar covers 45% of the original river width, and an approximate sediment volume worth 4,000,000 m3 has accumulated. Changes in the navigable channel result in slope modification from 2.02° to 5.36°. The construction of port structures, i.e. new pile bridges, changes the natural sediment flow, because they are obstacles, trapping sediments downstream. This period coincides with the end of a weak El Niño cycle, subsequent to a La Nina period also of low intensity, with reduced precipitation rates resulting in a decrease in flow, and therefore contributing to an increase in sedimentation. The observations suggest that it is crucial to understand the channel bars' morphology and origin to avoid possible economic and social impacts due to the disruptions in navigation.","Bathymetry,Satellite images,Navigation,Fluvial,Sedimentation,"
"high resolution magnetic survey for soil monitoring: detection of drainage and soil tillage effects","2003","This paper presents the results of high resolution magnetic cartography realized with a caesium vapor magnetometer on marshland plots in Western France. This site is interesting because of the clayey substratum homogeneity and the historical knowledge of plot exploitation. A wooden truck running on PVC rails allowed acquisition of accurate signals with dynamics of about 2 nT. Natural grassland presents weak decametric variations correlated to a micro-toposequence. Conversely, plots recently tilled show linear magnetic anomalies. These anomalies are interpreted as the effect of tractor tyre soil compaction which modify soil properties. In addition, the study of a drained plot, by a wavelet transform, reveals the presence of a frequency band close to the drain intervals. Moreover, the magnitude of the linear magnetic anomalies is higher above drains.

We develop a seaport operations model that simulates the decision making process associated with scheduling and processing of ships with the objective of evaluating the value of Geographical Information System (GIS) information. We consider two scenarios: (1) A traditional model where there is no GIS information on future ship arrivals; and (2) An information-rich model in which the arrival time of the next ship is known. We propose look-ahead based heuristics for the resulting optimization problems, determine the value of information (VOI), and tabulate how VOI varies as a function of the various operational parameters. Adding such operational intelligence to shipping operations improves the performance by as much as 60% (and by 15% on average) and reduces the costs without expanding the physical footprint of the seaport.","Biological system modeling,maritime shipping operation,Servers,competitive intelligence,supply chain management,geographical information system,Mathematical model,sea ports,geographic information systems,maritime supply chains,seaport operations model,value-of-information estimation,transportation,Marine vehicles,Geographic Information Systems,business intelligence,Analytical models,Supply chains,"

In this section, the paper shows that the main theoretical concepts and ideas remain similar for a long time ago but they are nuanced by the last data and analysis. Next, these new data and revisions are analysed, in particular the existence of Neolithic settler pioneer communities and “Mesolithic context with Neolithic elements”, the role of colonization phenomena (DNA analysis, leapfrog colonization and landscape occupation), the pottery studies like main interpretative tool and, finally, the variable of rock art.

"summer bloom of vulcanodinium rugosum in cienfuegos bay (cuba) associated to dermatitis in swimmers","2021","The marine dinoflagellate Vulcanodinium rugosum produces powerful paralyzing and cytotoxic compounds named pinnatoxins (PnTX) and portimines. Even though, no related human intoxication episodes following direct exposure in seawater or the ingestion of contaminated seafood have been documented so far. This study aimed at investigating a dinoflagellate bloom linked to acute dermatitis cases in two recreational beaches in Cienfuegos Bay, Cuba. We used epidemiological and clinical data from 60 dermatitis cases consisting of individuals in close contact with the bloom. Seawater physical-chemical properties were described, and the microorganism causing the bloom was identified by means of light and scanning electron microscopy. Morphological identification was confirmed genetically by sequencing the internal transcribed spacers ITS1 and ITS2, and the 5.8S rDNA region. Toxic compounds were identified from a bloom extract using liquid chromatography (LC) coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS), and their concentrations were estimated based on low-resolution tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Sixty people who had prolonged contact with the dinoflagellate bloom suffered acute dermal irritation. Most patients (79.2%) were children and had to be treated with antibiotics; some required >5-day hospitalization. Combined morphological and genetic characters indicated V. rugosum as the causative agent of the bloom. rDNA sequences of the V. rugosum genotype found in the bloom aligned with others from Asia, including material found in the ballast tank of a ship in Florida. The predominant toxins in the bloom were portimine, PnTX-F and PnTX-E, similar to strains originating from the Pacific Ocean. This bloom was associated with unusual weather conditions such as frequent and prolonged droughts. Our findings indicate a close link between the V. rugosum bloom and a dermatitis outbreak among swimmers in Cienfuegos Bay. Phylogenetic evidence suggests a recent introduction of V. rugosum from the Pacific Ocean into Caribbean waters, possibly via ballast water.","Microbial biogeography,Harmful algal bloom,Human health,Emergent toxin,Toxic dinoflagellate,Skin irritation,"
"pan-european distribution modelling of stream riparian zones based on multi-source earth observation data","2013","Freshwater ecosystems are among the most degraded and threatened globally. A need for systematic assessment of riverine habitats is thus well-documented. Riparian zones are especially important due to the large array of ecosystem and social services they can provide, while also recently gaining a major role in the new European biodiversity policy. In this context, the necessity to gather spatial information on extent, distribution and characteristics of the riparian zones is clear. This paper presents the development of a novel model to derive geographical distribution and basic characteristics of stream riparian zones in Europe, including both river-floodplain systems and the riparian networks of minor and ephemeral streams. A series of relevant descriptive attributes (water boundary, vegetation presence, land-cover, upland boundary and local geomorphology) is initially selected from the existing literature to describe the presence of riparian zones. Spatially explicit estimates of these attributes are obtained using available Earth Observation data and pan-European thematic datasets. Finally, the information layers are combined through an aggregation system that assigns a degree of belonging to the riparian zone class using two fuzzy membership functions to evaluate water influence and presence of natural vegetation, respectively. Riparian zones with no hydrological connection are also incorporated in by the model based on functional considerations. The distribution of stream riparian zones was derived and mapped for the whole of Europe at fine resolution. Modelled riparian zones extend for approximately 91,000km2, considering the entire range of low to high membership to the riparian class. A characterization of land-cover types was derived based on Corine Land Cover 2000 data, showing that European riparian zones are strongly dominated by forest habitats. Accuracy assessment was performed using independent ecological datasets and visual validation, indicating that producer accuracy is equal to 84.5±1.3% and user accuracy to 72.6±5.8% at 95% confidence level. The proposed model and output can represent valuable information for large-scale research activities of riparian environments and to support national and supra-national conservation programmes.","Geographical distribution,Riverine habitats,Transitional environments,Riparian zones,Fuzzy index,"

"variability and change in the west antarctic peninsula marine system: research priorities and opportunities","2019","The west Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) region has undergone significant changes in temperature and seasonal ice dynamics since the mid-twentieth century, with strong impacts on the regional ecosystem, ocean chemistry and hydrographic properties. Changes to these long-term trends of warming and sea ice decline have been observed in the 21st century, but their consequences for ocean physics, chemistry and the ecology of the high-productivity shelf ecosystem are yet to be fully established. The WAP shelf is important for regional krill stocks and higher trophic levels, whilst the degree of variability and change in the physical environment and documented biological and biogeochemical responses make this a model system for how climate and sea ice changes might restructure high-latitude ecosystems. Although this region is arguably the best-measured and best-understood shelf region around Antarctica, significant gaps remain in spatial and temporal data capable of resolving the atmosphere-ice-ocean-ecosystem feedbacks that control the dynamics and evolution of this complex polar system. Here we summarise the current state of knowledge regarding the key mechanisms and interactions regulating the physical, biogeochemical and biological processes at work, the ways in which the shelf environment is changing, and the ecosystem response to the changes underway. We outline the overarching cross-disciplinary priorities for future research, as well as the most important discipline-specific objectives. Underpinning these priorities and objectives is the need to better define the causes, magnitude and timescales of variability and change at all levels of the system. A combination of traditional and innovative approaches will be critical to addressing these priorities and developing a co-ordinated observing system for the WAP shelf, which is required to detect and elucidate change into the future.","Primary production,Physical oceanography,Southern Ocean,Ecosystems,Sea ice,Nutrient and carbon cycling,Antarctica,Climate change,West Antarctic Peninsula,"

"experimental verification of ecological interface prototype issued by an automated generation tool","2015","Vicente and Rasmussen have developed a method called Ecological Interface Design (EID) in the field of cognitive engineering .[1] In this context, we proposed a software tool named Anaxagore, that can assist the EID process for a rapid implementation of user interface prototypes. In a first stage, models based on standardized structure-functional diagram are computed .[2] In a second stage, these diagrams as inputs are transformed through a model-driven engineering process, involving a library of ecological graphical representations and an interface background. Then, an ecological interface prototype can be generated. Previously, Anaxagore was used to generate conventional synoptic representation .[3] To validate its EID extended version, an experimental protocol has been established. The experiment was conducted at the National Maritime College, with 14 naval officers randomly divided into two groups according to the used interface. After a preliminary training of participants to the use of the interfaces, four scenarios were simulated during the experiment. For each scenario, the performance was evaluated by a success score and by measuring the time to detect and understand failure. With the EID interface generated by Anaxagore, faster detection time and better diagnosis accuracy were observed. Anaxagore seems to constitute a response for assisting the rapid prototyping of ecological interface.","automatic generation,ecological interface design,protyping,design,"
"maritime pattern extraction from ais data using a genetic algorithm","2016","The long term prediction of maritime vessels' destinations and arrival times is essential for making an effective logistics planning. As ships are influenced by various factors over a long period of time, the solution cannot be achieved by analyzing sailing patterns of each entity separately. Instead, an approach is required, that can extract maritime patterns for the area in question and represent it in a form suitable for querying all possible routes any vessel in that region can take. To tackle this problem we use a genetic algorithm (GA) to cluster vessel position data obtained from the publicly available Automatic Identification System (AIS). The resulting clusters are treated as route waypoints (WP), and by connecting them we get nodes and edges of a directed graph depicting maritime patterns. Since standard clustering algorithms have difficulties in handling data with varying density, and genetic algorithms are slow when handling large data volumes, in this paper we investigate how to enhance the genetic algorithm to allow fast and accurate waypoint identification. We also include a quad tree structure to preprocess data and reduce the input for the GA. When the route graph is created, we add post processing to remove inconsistencies caused by noise in the AIS data. Finally, we validate the results produced by the GA by comparing resulting patterns with known inland water routes for two Dutch provinces.","data mining,Clustering algorithms,Genetic algorithms,vessel position data cluster,marine navigation,directed graph,maritime pattern extraction,sailing pattern analysis,quadtrees,Biological cells,genetic algorithms,genetic algorithm,ships,Genetic Algorithms,automatic identification system,inland water routes,Dutch provinces,logistics planning,Automatic Identification System,quad tree structure,Data Mining,directed graphs,pattern clustering,Artificial intelligence,route querying,maritime vessel destination prediction,Pattern Recognition,Logistics,Synchromodal Logistics,long term prediction,route waypoints,Boats,logistics data processing,Data mining,AIS data,arrival time prediction,data handling,"

"permafrost and climate in europe: monitoring and modelling thermal, geomorphological and geotechnical responses","2009","We present a review of the changing state of European permafrost within a spatial zone that includes the continuous high latitude arctic permafrost of Svalbard and the discontinuous high altitude mountain permafrost of Iceland, Fennoscandia and the Alps. The paper focuses on methodological developments and data collection over the last decade or so, including research associated with the continent-scale network of instrumented permafrost boreholes established between 1998 and 2001 under the European Union PACE project. Data indicate recent warming trends, with greatest warming at higher latitudes. Equally important are the impacts of shorter-term extreme climatic events, most immediately reflected in changes in active layer thickness. A large number of complex variables, including altitude, topography, insolation and snow distribution, determine permafrost temperatures. The development of regionally calibrated empirical-statistical models, and physically based process-oriented models, is described, and it is shown that, though more complex and data dependent, process-oriented approaches are better suited to estimating transient effects of climate change in complex mountain topography. Mapping and characterisation of permafrost depth and distribution requires integrated multiple geophysical approaches and recent advances are discussed. We report on recent research into ground ice formation, including ice segregation within bedrock and vein ice formation within ice wedge systems. The potential impacts of climate change on rock weathering, permafrost creep, landslides, rock falls, debris flows and slow mass movements are also discussed. Recent engineering responses to the potentially damaging effects of climate warming are outlined, and risk assessment strategies to minimise geological hazards are described. We conclude that forecasting changes in hazard occurrence, magnitude and frequency is likely to depend on process-based modelling, demanding improved understanding of geomorphological process-response systems and their impacts on human activity.","permafrost engineering,geothermal monitoring,slope stability,climate change,permafost hazards,geothermal modelling,geophysics,European permafrost,"
"obstacle avoidance and target search of an autonomous surface vehicle for 2016 maritime robotx challenge","2017","This paper describes algorithms for Autonomous Surface Vehicle(ASV) obstacle avoidance and target search task. This work is primarily designed for task mission of 2016 Maritime RobotX competition. In this task, ASV must avoid obstacle buoys, while it is searching for totem-shaped buoy. To deal with such problem, algorithms for both perception and motion planning stage was designed. In perception stage, 2D scanning LIDAR and monocular vision sensor are used to detect any floating objects on the water. To recognize target (totem buoy), HSV color space information was used. Detected object (both obstacle and totem buoy) information is tracked by using Kalman filter. In action planning stage, both deliberative and reflexive action [2] planning are designed. In deliberative action planning stage, based on the Kalman filter tracked obstacle information, a grid map can be generated. Using the grid map and A* search algorithm, desired path for searching totem can be calculated. In reflexive action planning stage, once ASV accidently enters hazardous region, where it has high probability of getting collide, it is designed to reflexively escape the region by making pure sway motion.

"shelf-wide analyses of sand wave migration using gis: a case study on the netherlands continental shelf","2023","Shelf seas often display rhythmic bedforms, of which tidal sand waves are the most relevant to study from an engineering point of view due to their dimensions and dynamic nature. Environmental conditions such as water depth, flow velocities and grain size vary across entire shelf regions, consequently influencing the characteristics of tidal sand waves, including migration rates. However, as opposed to site-specific analyses, shelf sea-wide analyses on sand wave migration are scarce. Through the use of timeseries of bathymetric data, we investigate the spatial variability of sand wave migration on the scale of the Netherlands Continental Shelf (NCS). Two existing data-driven techniques, Pairs of Source and Target Points (PSTP) and Spatial Cross Correlation (SCC), were implemented in a Geographic Information System (GIS). Through testing at four sites on the NCS, PSTP was deemed the preferred technique for a shelf-wide analysis and was hence used to quantify the NCS-wide migration rates and directions. To illustrate the spatial variability, the quantified migration rates and directions were averaged per km2. For the NCS in general, migration to the south-west or north-east at typical rates between 0 and 3 m/year was found. The south-western region of the NCS demonstrated migration rates below 0.5 m/year with migration directions alternating over short distances. The north-eastern region exhibited uniform migration to the north-east at rates which gradually increased when in closer proximity to the Wadden Islands. Typical rates in this region were found to be between 2 and 8 m/year. The highest migration rates were observed near coastal regions and on top of sandbanks. The presence of these sandbanks strongly deflects the migration directions of superimposed sand waves at a number of locations. The analysis performed within this study demonstrates valuable insights into methods that can be used to evaluate shelf-wide regions of interest. A deeper understanding of the dynamic nature of the North Sea bed assists in optimising hydrographic re-survey policies, critical infrastructure planning and subsequent monitoring. Furthermore, this study may offer a wider set of tools that could be used for correlating sand wave migration to its governing physical mechanisms and environmental parameters.","North Sea,Data analysis,Spatial variation,Tidal sand wave migration,GIS,Netherlands Continental Shelf,"
"spatial networks","2011","Complex systems are very often organized under the form of networks where nodes and edges are embedded in space. Transportation and mobility networks, Internet, mobile phone networks, power grids, social and contact networks, and neural networks, are all examples where space is relevant and where topology alone does not contain all the information. Characterizing and understanding the structure and the evolution of spatial networks is thus crucial for many different fields, ranging from urbanism to epidemiology. An important consequence of space on networks is that there is a cost associated with the length of edges which in turn has dramatic effects on the topological structure of these networks. We will thoroughly explain the current state of our understanding of how the spatial constraints affect the structure and properties of these networks. We will review the most recent empirical observations and the most important models of spatial networks. We will also discuss various processes which take place on these spatial networks, such as phase transitions, random walks, synchronization, navigation, resilience, and disease spread.","Statistical physics,Urban systems,Networks,Graphs,Geography,Spatial properties,"
"chapter 18 - characteristics of tropical cyclones through remote sensing-based observational platforms","2023","The tropical cyclones (or TCs) being one of the most extreme weather events have the potential to cause catastrophic destruction to both human lives and properties. Its life span generally expands from a few days to weeks and the destruction caused by its combined effect of duration and size is incomparable to any other forms of atmospheric disturbances. In this sense, in order to assess its impact on infrastructure and properties, and to save innocent lives, remote sensing (RS) techniques, and platforms can be employed. In an operational basis, RS and geographical information system are mostly used for monitoring of TCs and early warning. In this chapter, an insight on the use of RS platforms is provided for TC research and forecasting along with the application to the study of their detection, radial, structural, meteorological, and ocean characteristic features. Furthermore, the impact of satellite RS on TC forecast with respect to reduction in track and forecast errors is discussed.

"lanepost: lane-based optimal routing protocol for delay-tolerant maritime networks","2017","Ship-to-ship, ship-to-shore radio links empowered by WiFi, WiMAX etc have been recently exploited to build maritime multi-hop mesh networks to provide internet services to on-ship users. However, because of the mobility of the vessels/ships and the large inter-ship distances, nodes in the maritime network are frequently disconnected, forcing data communication in the maritime mesh networks to be opportunistic and delay-tolerant. In this paper, we present LanePost, an optimization approach for maritime delay-tolerant routing protocol. We exploit the shipping lane information to predict the rendezvous opportunities of the ships to optimize the route selection in delay-tolerant routing. In particular, we show that when the shipping lane information is available, an opportunistic routing graph (ORG) for each ship can be constructed to predict its multi-hop data routing opportunities to the other ships or to the shore. Based on the ORG, we develop an optimal route protocol (i.e., LanePost) for each ship to minimize its delay of multi-hop packet delivery via dynamic programming. We discussed the ways of collecting shipping lane information by centralized method or distributed method. The proposed LanePost protocol was evaluated by ONE, an open-source delay-tolerant network simulator, which shows its dramatic performance improvement in terms of delay reduction compared to the state-of-the-art opportunistic routing protocols.","radio links,maritime,wireless mesh networks,Marine vehicles,delay-tolerant,Delays,Mesh networks,routing protocols,ORG,delay minimization,waterway networks,trafficlane,Routing protocols,opportunistic routing graph,Internet service,data communication,ships,intership distance,route selection,centralized method,maritime multihop mesh network,LanePost protocol,shipping lane information,multihop packet delivery delay,delay-tolerant maritime network,dynamic programming,Spread spectrum communication,graph theory,ship-to-shore radio link,opportunistic routing,distributed method,on-ship user,open-source delay-tolerant network simulator,delay reduction,optimization approach,lane-based optimal routing protocol,Routing,delay tolerant networks,ship-to-ship radio link,marine communication,vessel-ship mobility,multihopnetworks,"
"ferrybox and meris – assessment of coastal and shelf sea ecosystems by combining in situ and remotely sensed data","2008","An automatic measuring system called “FerryBox” was installed in the North Sea on a ferry travelling between Germany (Cuxhaven) and Great Britain (Harwich), enabling online oceanographic and biological measurements such as salinity, temperature, fluorescence, turbidity, oxygen, pH, and nutrient concentrations. Observations made along the ferry transect reveal characteristic phenomena such as high salinity inflow through the Channel into the Southern Bight, algal bloom dynamics and related oxygen and pH changes. Combination of these online observations with remote sensing enhances the spatial resolution of the transect related measurements. Several examples of the synergy between these two measuring strategies are shown, both for large-scale algal blooms in the North Sea as well as for local intense but short-term blooms in the German Bight. Coherence of the data sets can be gained and improved by using water transport models in order to obtain synoptic overviews of the remotely sensed and FerryBox related parameters. Limitations of the currently used algorithms for deriving chlorophyll-a from remote sensing images for coastal and shelf seas (Case-2 water) are discussed, as well as depth related processes which cannot be properly resolved on the basis of water intake at a fixed point. However, in unstratified coastal waters under normal conditions FerryBox data represent average conditions. The importance of future applications of this combination of methods for monitoring of coastal waters is emphasized.","monitoring,ships-of-opportunity,colour remote sensing,primary production,chlorophyll-,"
"coral skeletal geochemistry as a monitor of inshore water quality","2016","Coral reefs maintain extraordinary biodiversity and provide protection from tsunamis and storm surge, but inshore coral reef health is degrading in many regions due to deteriorating water quality. Deconvolving natural and anthropogenic changes to water quality is hampered by the lack of long term, dated water quality data but such records are required for forward modelling of reef health to aid their management. Reef corals provide an excellent archive of high resolution geochemical (trace element) proxies that can span hundreds of years and potentially provide records used through the Holocene. Hence, geochemical proxies in corals hold great promise for understanding changes in ancient water quality that can inform broader oceanographic and climatic changes in a given region. This article reviews and highlights the use of coral-based trace metal archives, including metal transported from rivers to the ocean, incorporation of trace metals into coral skeletons and the current ‘state of the art’ in utilizing coral trace metal proxies as tools for monitoring various types of local and regional source-specific pollution (river discharge, land use changes, dredging and dumping, mining, oil spills, antifouling paints, atmospheric sources, sewage). The three most commonly used coral trace element proxies (i.e., Ba/Ca, Mn/Ca, and Y/Ca) are closely associated with river runoff in the Great Barrier Reef, but considerable uncertainty remains regarding their complex biogeochemical cycling and controlling mechanisms. However, coral-based water quality reconstructions have suffered from a lack of understanding of so-called vital effects and early marine diagenesis. The main challenge is to identify and eliminate the influence of extraneous local factors in order to allow accurate water quality reconstructions and to develop alternate proxies to monitor water pollution. Rare earth elements have great potential as they are self-referencing and reflect basic terrestrial input.","Scleractinian corals,Trace element uptake,Coral calcification,Coral geochemical proxies,Water quality,"

"assessment of arctic snow stratigraphy and water equivalent using a portable frequency modulated continuous wave radar","2023","There is significant spatial variability in snow cover characteristics across the Arctic. Current physical or empirical approaches to simulate or measure snow state variables suffer from poor spatial and/or temporal resolutions. Our current understanding of the spatio-temporal variability in Arctic snow cover leads to uncertainties in existing snow property retrievals from space or in models, thus leading to a poor representation of the snow cover in various climate models and reanalysis products. In this paper, we developed a method to derive total snow depth from a ground-based radar as well as distinguishing the two main layers generally observed in Arctic snowpacks: Depth Hoar and Wind Slab. This algorithm was developed for a 24 GHz Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave radar. The novelty of our approach resides in the fact that no validation snow pits are required if previous data on snow conditions (snow depth and density) are known. The impact of the underlying ecotypes on the radar-derived snow stratigraphy was also investigated. The RMSE of the snow depth ranges from 3.5 to 25 cm, but mostly varies between 10 and 15 cm (< 25%). The RMSE is based on snow pit data that has a corresponding radar measurement.","Snow depth retrieval,Radar,Snow pit,Ecotype,Arctic snow,FMCW,"

Thermal demagnetization of the Maringouin Fm. isolated a characteristic remanence direction of D= 178.7Â°, I= 24.9Â°, Î±95= 14.5Â°, N= 9.High field anisotropy of isothermal remanence followed by alternating field and thermal cleaning on leached samples was used to isolate the fabric of hematite. Individual particle anisotropy was measured directly from magnetic separates using a new technique. Hematite's magnetic fabric and particle anisotropy were used to apply an inclination correction. Our inclination corrections indicate up to 10Â° of inclination shallowing, corresponding to corrected palaeopole positions of 27.2Â°N, 118.3Â°E, A95= 6.2Â° and 27.4Â°N, 117.2Â°E, A95= 13.1Â° for the Shepody and Maringouin formations, respectively. This correction corresponds to a âˆ¼ 6Â° increase in colatitude for Carboniferous North America, which translates into approximately a 650 km change in North America's palaeogeographic position. The proposed position of North America supports a Pangea B-type reconstruction.","Palaeomagnetism applied to Tectonics,Magnetic mineralogy and petrology,Palaeomagnetism applied to geologic processes,Magnetic fabrics and anisotropy,Rock and mineral magnetism,"
"simultaneous determination of four organotins in food packaging by high-performance liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry","2015","A simple method based on high-performance liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) was developed for the simultaneous determination of organotins—tri-n-butyltin chloride (TBT), triphenyltin chloride (TPT), dibutyltin dichloride (DBT), and diphenyltin dichloride (DPT)—in plastic food packaging. Samples were prepared by ultrasonic extraction with dichloromethane, followed by dissolution in acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid, and purification by an MCX column. The extracts were analyzed by LC–MS/MS in multiple reaction monitoring and positive modes with a C18 column; elution was carried out with a gradient of 0.1% formic acid and methanol containing 0.1% formic acid. The limits of detection for TBT, TPT, DBT, and DPT were 0.1, 0.6, 0.8, and 0.3μgkg−1, respectively. The recovery of organotins in spiked samples ranged from 68% to 113% (relative standard deviation: 0.4–4.2%). The proposed method was successfully employed to identify the target analytes in plastic packaging used for milk and cake.","Simultaneous determination,LC–MS/MS,Food packaging,Organotin compounds,"
"maritime linked data for situational awareness heterogeneous sensor networks","2021","Maritime heterogeneous sensor networks (HSN), which are widely used in support of marine monitoring, maritime security and safety applications, combine diversified sensing systems and platforms observing the state of environmental features of interest or the status of anthropogenic objects to achieve awareness on the situation. To model the information characteristics of HSN observations for maritime situational awareness (MSA), we developed the MSA-HSN ontology, an integrated semantic model for maritime linked data, specifically observations suiting the requirements of maritime information fusion systems. MSA-HSN integrates established ontologies and models for sensors, observations, measurements, quantities, and occurrents, tailored to MSA applications and requirements. To support the interoperability with existing maritime data models, MSA-HSN is aligned with the relevant aspects of the EUCISE/e-CISE (Common Information Sharing Environment) data models. As a validation use case, in this paper the MSA-HSN ontology is applied to model the information elements of the maritime surveillance system developed within the Interactive Extreme-Scale Analytics and Forecasting (INFORE) project, where different situational views offered by a variegate suite of sensors and platforms are fused using big data analytics to achieve maritime situational awareness for maritime security. The paper describes the design of the MSA-HSN ontology, illustrating its application through examples taken from the INFORE use case and from relevant datasets developed by recent European projects involving MSA use cases.","Heterogeneous Sensor Network (HSN),Semantics,information characteristics,Linked data,Occurrents,Maritime Security,safety applications,maritime surveillance system,maritime data models,HSN observations,maritime security,Sea measurements,integrated semantic model,situational awareness heterogeneous sensor networks,MSA applications,common information sharing environment,Information Quality,maritime situational awareness,MSA-HSN ontology,maritime information fusion systems,data analysis,Maritime Surveillance,wireless sensor networks,Ontology,Oceans,Data models,different situational views,European projects,Maritime Situational Awareness (MSA),MSA use cases,maritime heterogeneous sensor networks,Knowledge Graph,ontologies (artificial intelligence),marine monitoring,big data analytics,Maritime Linked Data,Big Data,MSA Ontology,Java,Ontologies,maritime linked data,marine communication,video surveillance,Maritime Events,INFORE project,interactive extreme-scale analytics and forecasting,"
"a high resolution satellite view of the aerosol weekly cycle variability over central europe","2012","In this study, the aerosol weekly cycle patterns over Central Europe are defined, using high resolution aerosol data from TERRA MODIS satellite instrument. A decadal (2/2000-2/2010) high resolution gridded dataset was compiled using MODIS TERRA level-2 data. The general aerosol optical depth (AOD550nm) weekly patterns were defined at a 0.1°×0.1° resolution using the weekly cycle index (WCI). To remove episodic dust transport events, two different aerosol flags, employing fine mode ratio (FMR550nm) and AOD550nm data, were applied diagnostically. The region of interest is Central Europe, which is an area with a recorded aerosol weekly cycle. The main body of the positive (midweek peak) weekly cycle plume extends over the central part of Central Europe with the WCI levels gradually lowering until the weekly cycle becomes negative (weekend peak) when moving away from the main body of the plume. There is not a clear connection between the WCI patterns and topography while there is a correlation between a positive weekly cycle in summer and population density. The use of the two aerosol flags does not change the WCI patterns giving an indication of the continental character of the plume. A clear Monday minimum appears over the regions which are characterized by a high positive WCI. Monday shifts to Tuesday when moving to the East which is indicative of an aerosol transport from the dominating westerly wind flow. The investigation of the WCI and the average percent departure (APD) for the day of weekly maximum/minimum, for 22 stations examined in previous weekly cycle studies, reveals that the weekly cycle is positive and statistically significant for only a few stations situated in France, Germany, Czech Republic and Belgium. The 1°×1° MODIS TERRA data in most cases can give an indication of the local aerosol weekly cycle strength and phase. It is shown here that the satellite derived day of the weekly maximum and minimum is in general in line with results from ground-based studies; however, the weekly variability does not agree with the variability shown in these studies. The investigation of the seasonal WCI and maximum/minimum day patterns reveals that the signal of the positive weekly cycle plume appearing over Central Europe is very strong during summer. The day of maximum AOD550nm ranges between Wednesday, Thursday and Friday becoming Saturday for the Eastern regions. The day of minimum is Monday for the central parts becoming Tuesday for the Eastern regions. This summer shift of the day of maximum and minimum for regions situated in the Central and Eastern Central Europe is an indication of the transport of the aerosols from the dominating westerly wind flow. Parts of the summer positive weekly cycle plume can be observed in spring and autumn.","Aerosols,Weekly cycle,Satellite observations,Central Europe,TERRA MODIS,"
"locating submerged prehistoric settlements: a new underwater survey method using water-jet coring and micro-geoarchaeological techniques","2021","In the past few decades the field of submerged prehistory has produced important data highlighting ancient coastal habitation across the globe. Most prehistoric underwater sites are discovered by chance (e.g., by industry, fishermen or recreational divers). New methods for detecting submerged prehistoric settlements have been developed using sophisticated remote sensing devices, yet with limited success. Simple, practical, and inexpensive methods for locating submerged settlements remain rare. Over 60 years of underwater archaeology and submerged prehistory in Israel, specifically along the Carmel coast, has led to a model for locating and studying submerged settlements, based on sand removal by storms. This study aimed to take this model a step further by developing a new, inexpensive method to identify, locate and characterize submerged sites. We collected undisturbed paleosol cores from exposed areas as well as under a few meters of sand, using a newly developed water-jet core sampling system. The cores were analyzed using micro-geoarchaeological techniques initially developed on terrestrial sites. The rationale behind this methodology is based on established knowledge that where human settlements occur, sediments are enriched by specific mineralogical signatures (e.g., heated clay minerals) and anthropogenic micro-remain assemblages (e.g., phytoliths, ash pseudomorphs and dung spherulites). Additionally, micromorphology can assist in identifying micro-stratigraphic patterns typical of human settlements. We tested sediment cores in three underwater contexts: a) exposed prehistoric surfaces within two known Neolithic sites (Atlit-Yam and Neve Yam), b) exposed paleosols without visible archaeological remains (serving as a control), and c) as a blind test, a buried paleosol currently covered by 1–3 m of sand, where the existence of a site is unknown. In the cores taken from the exposed Neolithic settlements, the micro-geoarchaeological characterization showed clear anthropogenic signals (typical mineralogy, elevated micro-remain concentrations, micro-stratigraphy). In the paleosol control cores, there was an absence (or negligible presence) of anthropogenic signals. The ‘blind test’ at the sand-covered locality revealed sediments without anthropogenic enrichments (similar to the control paleosols), thus suggesting the absence of a submerged settlement in this specific location. The new method is time- and cost-effective and can easily be applied worldwide along the shallow continental shelf as well as in deep water. The new method will facilitate discovery of new underwater sites and provide selection criteria (e.g., where the highest anthropogenic signal exists) for investment in underwater excavations. Additionally, it can be used to check for anthropogenic signals in buried locations detected by remote sensing, and to understand the spatial organization of submerged sites.","Manual coring,Neolithic Carmel coast,Micro-geoarchaeology,Submerged prehistory,Underwater archaeology,Water-jet coring,"
"review on the current state of scenario- and simulation-based v&v in application for maritime traffic systems","2021","Due to their importance for the global market, interest in (highly) automated and autonomous maritime transport systems has increased significantly in recent years. One of the main challenges in the development of such transport systems is to ensure functionality and safety. Due to the introduction of non-deterministic approaches, such as the use of self-learning artificial intelligence, classical methods for safety verification are no longer suitable. Systematic scenario-based validation and verification approaches have already been proposed to address this problem. Often these are based on the use of simulations. Currently, a lot of effort is put into the implementation of such simulation systems and many (partial) solutions have already been proposed. Nevertheless, a common line of thought seems to be missing. This study, therefore, identifies requirements for such systems, systematically searches for published scientific literature to identify existing systems, reviews the systems found regarding the posed requirements, and in that way identifies open research gaps. Finally, as a result of this detailed literature search and review, precise recommendations for future studies are given.","Safety,systematic literature review,self-learning artificial intelligence,transportation,systematic scenario-based validation,program testing,autonomous maritime transport systems,nondeterministic approaches,Bibliographies,marine safety,formal specification,safety verification,Globalization,Databases,Oceans,simulation,scenario-based testing,verification and validation,maritime traffic systems,Complexity theory,simulation-based testing,unmanned surface vehicles,artificial intelligence,simulation-based V and V,program verification,Systematics,"

The characteristics of ocean data and the related data processing techniques are also described. Secondly, the main tasks of ocean data analysis are introduced. Based on the main analysis tasks in the field of oceanography, the survey emphasizes related interactive visualization techniques and tools from four aspects: visualization of multiple ocean environmental elements and multivariate analysis, ocean phenomena identification and tracking, patterns or correlation discovery, ensembles and uncertainties exploration.

"a data mining method to extract traffic network for maritime transport management","2023","Maritime traffic network is essential for navigation efficiency and safety of the maritime transport system. This study proposes a framework for extracting maritime traffic network based on Automatic Identification System (AIS) data. The framework consists of maritime traffic pattern recognition, semantic routes extraction, route decomposition, and network generation. Firstly, a data-driven method is introduced to recognize ship behavior patterns and extends the single ship behaviors to regional characteristics to determine the departure-arrival areas. Then, based on the different combination of departure-arrival areas, the ship trajectories are classified to traffic groups. Subsequently, the grid-system is used to rasterize each traffic group, which realizes the fusion of trajectory data and geographic location information. Finally, to obtain the main routes and navigation channels, the extraction method is introduced by establishing the cumulative grid importance function. The main routes, together with the navigation channels, compose the maritime traffic network. The method is applied to AIS data in the Beibu Gulf, and the results show that the traffic network contains 12 stop areas, 4 entry/exit locations, 13 main routes as well as their corresponding navigation channels. It is therefore concluded that the proposed method helps (1) provide a theoretical framework to obtain and analyze the maritime traffic network and (2) enrich navigation channel identification methods for maritime transport management.","Maritime traffic network,Maritime transport management,AIS,Machine learning,Big data analytics,"
"permeability and voids influence on the thermal signal, as inferred by multitemporal uav-based infrared and visible images","2020","This work presents for the first time associated thermal anomalies and deformations over subsurface cavities/voids located within two harbour quays in Le Havre Harbourg, Normandy, France. An U.A.V. (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) was used to acquire visible and thermal images over a diurnal cycle (from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m.). The visible images were processed to realize an altimetric model of the platforms by mean of the photogrammetric method, while the thermal infrared (TIR) images were used to study the evolution of their surface temperatures. The obtained 3D model shows the location of five topographic depressions on both quays. The analysis of the evolution of the surface thermal field leads to the detection of cold thermal anomalies that are (1) not correlated to surface properties, and (2) spatially associated to the flanks of the five topographic depressions. Using a 2D conductive-radiative model, we show that these anomalies are not directly due to the thermally insulating effect of an air-filled area. Finally, we conclude that preferential infiltration and subsequent evaporation in the micro-fracturation present within the flanks of the depressions may be responsible for the strong cooling of these zones.","Thermal infrared,Photogrammetry,Remote Sensing,infiltration,Subsurface cavity,Natural hazards,UAV,"
"what is going on within google earth engine? a systematic review and meta-analysis","2023","Google Earth Engine (GEE) is a geospatial processing platform based on geo-information applications in the ‘cloud’. This platform provides free access to huge volumes of satellite data for computing, and offers support tools to monitor and analyse environmental features on a large scale. Such facilities have been widely used in numerous studies about land management and planning. Considering the current lack of relevant overviews, it may be useful to evaluate the utilization paths of GEE and its impact on the scientific community. For this purpose, a systematic review has been conducted using the PRISMA methodology based on 343 articles published from 2020 to 2022 in high-impact scientific journals, selected from the Scopus and Google Scholar databases. After an overview of the publishing context, an analysis of the frequency of satellite features, processing methods, applications are carried out, and a special attention is given to the COVID-19 studies. Finally, the geographical distribution of the reviewed articles is evaluated, and the citation impact metrics is analysed. On a bibliometric approach, 90 journals published articles on GEE in the reference period (January 2020 to April 2022), and this large number of journals reveals the multidisciplinary application of GEE platform as well as the interest of publishers towards this topic of relevance for the international scientific community. The results of the meta-analysis following the systematic review showed that: (i) the Landsat 8 was the most widely-used satellite (25%); (i) the non-parametric classification methods, mainly Random Forest, were the most recurrent algorithms (31%); and (iii) the water resources assessment and prediction were the most common methodological applications (22%). A low number of articles about COVID-19, in spite of the planetary importance of the pandemic effects. The reviewed articles were geographically distributed among 86 countries, China, United States, and India accounting for the large number. ‘Remote Sensing’ and ‘Remote Sensing of Environment’ were the leading journals in the citation impact metrics, while the Random Forest method and the agriculture-related applications being the mostly cited. It is expected that these results might change over the mid to long term, due to fast progress in environmental and spatial information technologies, although currently our findings may be worthwhile and useful for assessing the current global deployment of GEE platform.","Geo-big data,Cloud computing,Remote sensing,Global monitoring,Environmental spatial analysis,"
"rapid prototyping of high performance fuzzy computing applications using high level gpu programming for maritime operations support","2011","The advent of relatively cheap general purpose graphics processing units (GPUs) is having a huge impact on scientific computing. This is opening the door to high performance fuzzy computing (HPFC) to the masses, due to the low cost and the possibility to have GPUs on desktop computers at home. Furthermore, even mobile HPFC seems imminent, provided that your laptop is equipped with a general purpose GPU. Very recently another innovation has occurred: the availability of libraries for high level GPU programming. By using them, the programmer avoids the necessity of having detailed knowledge of the GPU's hardware architecture. The availability of such facility on Matlab (today among the most used rapid prototyping software) is also opening the door to the rapid prototyping of high performance applications, in general, and to the rapid prototyping of HPFC, in particular. In this work we show how to speed up an existing Matlab software prototype (which computes spatial maps for supporting decision making during maritime operations) with little effort. By delegating the GPU Matlab library to take care of low level optimizations, we not only save time, but also build rapidly prototyped software that is portable over different GPU hardware types.","desktop computers,software libraries,mobile HPFC,decision making support,Matlab software prototype,GPU Matlab library,Libraries,high level GPU programming,maritime operations support,GPU hardware architecture,marine engineering,Hardware,visual programming,low level optimization,Prototypes,Programming,decision making,software prototyping,high performance fuzzy computing application,fuzzy set theory,Computers,general purpose graphics processing unit,Decision support systems,rapid prototyping,Graphics processing unit,mathematics computing,coprocessors,computer graphic equipment,"
"environment-aware coverage optimization for space-ground integrated maritime communications","2020","To satisfy the growing demand for broadband maritime communications, space-ground integrated maritime communication networks (MCNs) arise, which are envisioned to take full advantage of both satellites and terrestrial shore-based networks. In practice, due to the frequent beam hopping of satellites and the limited number of geographically available onshore base-station sites, the space-ground integrated MCN usually presents a highly non-cellular network structure, leading to both challenging blind zones and coverage areas with severe interference. In this paper, we optimize the coverage performance by exploiting the marine environment information. Particularly, the transmit antenna correlation is estimated using the location and mobility information of scatterers on the sea, such as lighthouses, reefs, islands, and vessels. The position and attitude information of satellites are also utilized for interference estimation. Based on that, we optimize the input covariance and precoding matrix to maximize the ergodic sum capacity for all mobile terminals within the coverage. It is a complicated non-convex problem, especially because the ergodic sum capacity is difficult to be expressed straightly without the expectation operator. We introduce an upper bound of the ergodic sum capacity using the path loss and the transmit antenna correlation estimated from the environment information, and then propose an iterative algorithm to solve the problem by solving a set of convex subproblems. The proposed environment-aware scheme is evaluated using the real-world geographic information of a coastal area of China. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can greatly improve the ergodic sum capacity and the energy efficiency compared with existing approaches, and achieve dynamic coverage to match the non-cellular network structure.","Satellites,complicated nonconvex problem,ergodic sum capacity maximization,space-ground integrated MCN,Antenna arrays,matrix algebra,input covariance optimization,convex programming,path loss,non-cellular,environment-aware coverage optimization,Transmitting antennas,concave programming,coverage performance optimization,beam hopping,space-ground integrated maritime communications,dynamic coverage,environment-aware scheme,precoding matrix,scatterer mobility information,precoding,Maritime communications,broadband maritime communications,Propagation losses,satellite-based networks,real-world geographic information,Correlation,radiofrequency interference,terrestrial shore-based networks,coverage optimization,transmitting antennas,satellite antennas,iterative methods,noncellular network structure,Optimization,onshore base-station sites,broadband networks,marine environment information,marine communication,attitude information,interference estimation,upper bound,transmit antenna correlation,Interference,iterative algorithm,mobile terminals,energy efficiency,"
"the vöhrum section (northwest germany) and the aptian/albian boundary","2003","Prior to 1947, the Aptian/Albian boundary was placed at the base of the Nolaniceras nolani ammonite Zone. From (Trav. Lab. Géol. Fac. Sci. 26 (1947) 17), until (Cret. Res. 20 (1999) 609), the base of the Albian stage has been taken at the first appearance of the ammonite Leymeriella (Proleymeriella) schrammeni, a species known only from a limited area of northwest Germany. The early succession of Leymeriella and its relationship with ammonite taxa from the underlying Hypacanthoplites jacobi ammonite Zone can only be determined in the northwest German sections, all of which are ephemeral clay pits. Thus, the definition of the base of the Albian on these criteria cannot be used in a global context. The positioning of the boundary has been the subject of intense discussion in the last years. After the second International Symposium on Cretaceous Stage Boundaries in 1995 (Bull. Inst. R. Sci. Nat. Belgique, Sci. Terre 66 (1996) 45). (Cret. Res. 20 (1999) 609) lowered the boundary to the base of his Hypacanthoplites rubricosus ammonite Subzone without describing a global boundary stratotype section. (Cret. Res. 21 (2000) 591) raised the boundary to the alleged first occurrence (FO) of Leymeriella tardefurcata in a permanent section, but neither proposals can be accepted globally (Cret. Res. 23 (2002) 1). (Cret. Res. 22 (2001) 677) supported by (Cret. Res. 23 (2002) 1), suggested a radical solution by raising the boundary to the base of the geographically widespread Lyelliceras lyelli ammonite Subzone, currently the base of the Middle Albian. In order to document accurately the classical northwest German succession of the Aptian/Albian boundary, a detailed multidisciplinary study has been made of a new section at Vöhrum (clay pit no. 4) with respect to its content of calcareous nannofossils, benthic foraminifera, planktonic foraminifera, ostracods, ammonites, as well as its clay mineralogy, gamma ray signature and tuff geochemistry. The ammonite succession, in particular the Callizoniceras–Leymeriella lineage, is discussed in detail. The FO of Leymeriella (Proleymeriella) schrammeni anterior, 0.65m below a tuff horizon near the base of the section is taken as the Aptian/Albian boundary in the classical German sense.

Although the results from older excavations suggested the city’s engagement in interregional trade, these preliminary conclusions were based on chronologically and geographically restricted material and only a few scientific analyses, which have since been complemented and partly revised. It is now clear that long-distance exchange, based on the large-scale intra-urban production and distribution of copper, involved regional and more distant suppliers of coveted goods, and resulted in the transition of the settlement from a late 17th century B.C. village to a trade hub with a minimum extent of 25 ha.","Sardinia,Mycenae,Crete,Mesopotamia,Levant,Cyprus,Fauna,Georadar,Fish remains,Late Bronze Age,Copper production,FTIR,Magnetometers,Egypt,NAA,Interregional trade,Petrography,"

It is concluded that the hot spots of accidents in the South China Sea are mainly distributed in several important ports and coastal areas of the South China Sea, showing an obvious spatial clustering phenomenon. Meanwhile, combined with the time evolution of the past 40 years, this paper analyzes the spatio-temporal evolution of maritime accidents in the South China Sea, evaluates the risk of different maritime accidents and proposes corresponding prevention strategies, including strengthening supervision, conducting operation and technical training for sailors, using digital system to manage cargo and improving information sharing mechanism to promote cooperation among neighboring countries.

"adaptive detection tracking system for autonomous uav maritime patrolling","2020","Nowadays, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are considered reliable systems, suitable for several autonomous applications, especially for target detection and tracking. Although significant developments were achieved in object detection systems over the last decades using the deep learning technique known as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), there are still research gaps in this area. In this paper, we present a new object detection-tracking algorithm that can be used on low power consuming processing boards. In particular, we analysed a specific application scenario in which a UAV patrols coastlines and autonomously classifies different kind of marine objects. Current state of the art solutions propose centralised architectures or flying systems with human in the loop, making the whole system poorly efficient and not scalable. On the contrary, applying a Deep Learning detection system that runs on commercial Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) makes UAVs potentially more efficient than humans (especially for dull tasks like coastline patrolling) and the whole system becomes easily scalable because each UAV can fly independently and the Ground Control Station does not represent a bottleneck. To deal with this task, a database consisting of more than 115000 images was created to train and test several CNN architectures. Furthermore, an adaptive detection-tracking algorithm was introduced to make the whole system faster by optimizing the balancing between detecting new objects and tracking existing targets. The proposed solution is based on the measure of the tracking confidence and the frame similarity, by means of the Structural SIMilarity (SSIM) index, computed both globally and locally. Finally, the developed algorithms were tested on a realistic scenario by means of a UAV test-bed.","unmanned aerial vehicles,coastline patrolling,target detection,robot vision,adaptive detection tracking,Machine learning,Feature extraction,target tracking,service robots,object detection tracking,CNN,deep learning detection system,graphics processing units,Target tracking,object detection,pinhole camera model,image classification,autonomous UAV maritime patrolling,neural net architecture,convolutional neural nets,autonomous aerial vehicles,convolutional neural networks,Training,Convolutional neural networks,Unmanned aerial vehicles,CNN architectures,Detection-Tracking System,structural similarity index,autonomous classification,learning (artificial intelligence),Detectors,UAV,"
"underwater archaeological investigation using ground penetrating radar: a case analysis of shanglinhu yue kiln sites (china)","2018","In this study we explored the possibility and effectiveness of applying ground penetrating radar (GPR) to investigate underwater cultural relics. Using this innovative technique, the remains of Yue kiln and anomalous objects buried beneath the lake or suspended in the water can now be fully studied. Although GPR has been widely used for imaging archaeological sites, skepticism remains over its use in underwater archaeology. Nevertheless, some scholars suggest that it is possible to use GPR to detect underwater remains, which has been further confirmed by the use of electrical parameter measurement (EPM) in Shanglinhu Lake. An experiment was performed by our team using antennas of different frequencies in a particular area of the lake. The results showed that the penetrability of the 100 MHz antenna was enough to examine the targets, while the 400 MHz antenna performed well in shallow water (depth <4 m) due to higher resolution. Hence, for our underwater investigation, we used both antennas for maximum coverage. We used a radargram as a topographic map which shows cross sections of the lake. Analysis of the Shanglinhu Lake data indicated that GPR is a superior tool for underwater archaeological investigation. Traditional methods including sonar, underwater cameras and salvage dives were used as supporting techniques in the study.","Underwater archaeological investigation,Ground penetrating radar,Yue kiln remains,"
"variability and propagation of labrador sea water in the southern subpolar north atlantic","2009","The variability of two modes of Labrador Sea Water (LSW) (upper and deep Labrador Sea Water) and their respective spreading in the interior North Atlantic Ocean are investigated by means of repeated ship surveys carried out along the zonal WOCE line A2/AR19 located at 43–48°N (1993–2007) and along the GOOS line at about 48–51°N (1997–2002). Hydrographic section data are complemented by temperature, salinity, and velocity time series recorded by two moorings. They have been deployed at the western flank of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR) in the Newfoundland Basin during 1996–2004. The analysis of hydrographic anomalies at various longitudes points to a gradual eastward propagation of LSW-related signals, which happens on time scales of 3–6 years from the formation region towards the MAR. Interactions of the North Atlantic Current (NAC) with the Deep Western Boundary Current (DWBC) close to Flemish Cap point to the NAC being the main distributor of the different types of LSW into the interior of the Newfoundland Basin. Comparisons between the ship data and the mooring records revealed that the mooring sites are located in a region affected by highly variable flow. The mooring time series demonstrate an elevated level of variability with eddy activity and variability associated with the NAC considerably influencing the LSW signals in this region. Hydrographic data taken from Argo profiles from the vicinity of the mooring sites turned out to mimic quite well the temporal evolution captured by the moorings. There is some indication of occasional southward flow in the LSW layer near the MAR. If this can be considered as a hint to an interior LSW-route, it is at least of minor importance in comparison to the DWBC. It acts as an important supplier for the interior North Atlantic, distributing older and recently formed LSW modes southward along the MAR.","Water mass spreading,Subpolar North Atlantic,Mid-Atlantic Ridge,Ocean circulation,Labrador Sea Water,"
"response strategies of the main forest types to climatic anomalies across croatian biogeographic regions inferred from fapar remote sensing data","2014","Croatia is positioned in the transitional zone of South-eastern Europe and the Mediterranean, a region with frequent occurrence of severe droughts and dry spells, which makes it particularly vulnerable to the impact of climate change. It distends across three main European biogeographical regions – Continental, Alpine and Mediterranean – and therefore has a very high level of forest diversity comprised of 11 out of 14 European forest types. This makes it very convenient to study the exposure of main European forest types to extreme climatic events in the southern limits of their species distribution range. This study provides an assessment of responses of forest vegetation under episodes of climatic anomalies consisting of the most severe historical dry and warm spells in 2000 and 2003, together with the extremely rainy season in 2005 across Croatian territory. The question of interest in this study was to reveal how the existing forest types across the territorial gradient respond to highly expressed extreme climatic variations and to infer some clues about related adaptive strategies. The regional scale approach was applied which previously performed structural delineation of forest cover into eleven main forest groups or bioclimates and were examined considering functional differences. Responses of eleven bioclimatic types were analyzed by time series (1998–2005) of monthly FAPAR (The Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetic Active Radiation) coverage with a spatial resolution of 1.2km, freely available from JRC FAPAR project. To quantify and differentiate the vegetation response in the considered years we adopted indices of resilience (resistance, recovery, resilience and relative resilience). We also provided a modified approach by applying these indices on a seasonal scale to examine the relationship between variations of phenology and ecosystem responses. The results confirmed the modification of seasonality of photosynthetic activity in relation to the altitudinal and spatial gradient. At the intra-seasonal scale, we distinguished specific opportunistic behavior of the common beech and oak forest types to alternating climatic conditions. Beech forest types show a very high ability to shift their phenology to earlier spring warming as a consequence of global warming. However, continental and Mediterranean oak forest types and in particular Aleppo pine and holm oak forests showed a higher increase of FAPAR during rainy events. The revealed capability of some tree species to better exploit rainfall in very wet periodic episodes has to be further evaluated in drawing conclusions about the overall resilience of forests under future climate change scenarios.","Extreme climatic events,Forest resilience,Climate change impacts,Land surface phenology,Forest responses,Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR),"
"rare earth and trace elements of microbialites in upper jurassic coral- and sponge-microbialite reefs","2006","Major, trace (Y, Zr, Pb, Th and U), rare earth element (REE) and Sm–Nd isotope analyses were carried out on microbialites and detrital carbonate sediments collected in Upper Jurassic coral- and sponge-microbialite reef settings. Selected bioconstructions developed in various palaeogeographic settings and depositional environments on northwestern Tethys and eastern Atlantic margins: pure carbonate lagoon, carbonate-dominated deep shelf to epicontinental basin and mixed carbonate-siliciclastic shallow ramp and lagoon. The proximity to terrigenous sources directly controlled REE patterns of carbonate samples. Lateral and intra-reef sediments, and to a lesser degree stromatolitic microbial crusts, are more susceptible to contamination by terrigenous material than are microbialites of thrombolitic fabric. In mixed carbonate-siliciclastic settings, microbialites display a flat shale-normalized REE pattern. In pure carbonate lagoonal settings, microbialites have shale-normalized REE patterns similar to those of modern seawaters with a negative Ce anomaly [(Ce/Ce⁎) up to 0.14], positive La and Gd anomalies, and light REE depletion relative to heavy REE. These data imply that similar REE chemistry than modern seawater already occurred on the northwestern Tethys margin at the Upper Jurassic. Strong negative Ce anomalies (<0.4) imply microbialite formation in well-oxygenated seawaters both in coral reefs of pure carbonate lagoonal environments (Pagny-sur-Meuse) and sponge bioherms of deep-shelf settings (Plettenberg). Absence of positive Ce anomalies rules out an influence of alkaline and high-pH seawaters. Thus, REE patterns and Nd isotopic signatures, which are in perfect agreement with existing results for Tethysian seawater, confirm that microbialites can be used as proxies of palaeoenvironmental seawater chemical characteristics.","Rare earth elements,Coral and sponge reefs,Microbialites,Nd isotopes,Upper Jurassic seawater,Palaeoenvironment,"
"former el niño events: records from western south america","1993","The quasi-periodic alterations of the climate in South America and of the oceanographical conditions in the eastern Pacific Ocean, referred to as the “El Niño” phenomenon, are part of a global anomaly in the ocean-atmosphere interactive system (the El Niño-Southern Oscillation, ENSO). As this phenomenon is responsible for the major interannual climatic variability and has a great potential to document links between the atmospheric and oceanic circulations, it is important to understand its mechanism, its boundary conditions and the causes of the variations of its intensity. Many answers to such questions can be sought in the historical and geological record of El Niño occurrences. Former impacts of the El Niño phenomenon along the western coast of South America are documented by remnants of catastrophic rainfalls and associated river floods, records of lake salinity variations, beach ridge sequences and numerous evidences of alterations in the biotic and physical coastal environment. For the last millennium or so, relatively precise (although discontinuous) archaeological and historical data are available. Continuous, high-resolution, proxy records are provided by glaciological data (last 1500 yr) from the Quelccaya ice cap of southern Peru and are potentially available from coral cores from the Galapagos Islands. No marine varves that would permit a detailed and sequential study of El Niño-related oceanographic anomalies during the late Quaternary have yet been obtained off western South America. The reconstruction of the sequence of the main ENSO events during the last millennia is thus hampered by the fact that there are too few continuous records and that these have not necessarily registered every El Niño occurrence and/or the relative intensity of each event. The discontinuous records of major El Niño events are more numerous, but often lack the required chronological accuracy. Obviously, both series of data need to be cross-checked and compared with information (e.g. dendroclimatology and marine varves) from other regions of the globe where climate teleconnections with the ENSO phenomenon can be assessed.",""

Oil drift was forced by the high-resolution sea circulation provided by CMEMS and the ECMWF wind. Successive model runs were restarted 5 times with the distinct overflight- and satellite-derived observations provided by REMPEC and the Copernicus Sentinel-1 mission. The results were verified based on the ability to predict the first oil-beaching event that happened near Saint-Tropez (France) in the early afternoon of 16th October. Despite the general consistency among the runs, only the last initialization was able to forecast the oil beaching. Stochastic MEDSLIK-II simulations forced by the historical meteo-oceanographic datasets 2014–2018 revealed that the coastlines between Cap Lardier and the Gulf of Saint-Tropez were among the most impacted areas.","Oil spill emergency,MEDSLIK-II,REMPEC-MONGOOS collaboration,Deterministic and stochastic forecasts,Liguro-Provençal basin,CMEMS,"
"an insight into the “fifty-fathom-flat” off india's west coast","2010","The architecture of the western continental margin of India (WCMI) is likely to have been influenced in the geological past by several episodes of volcanic eruptions, rifting, and continental break-up. The WCMI is characterized by a wide shelf in the north (few hundreds of kilometers wide), which tapers down to just few kilometers towards the south. A detailed multibeam swath bathymetry study was made of a part of the wide flat shelf off Mumbai encountered at an approximate depth of 50fathom (about 100m) that holds one of the world's richest offshore petroleum resources. The multibeam bathymetry images suggest that the western boundary of the Fifty-Fathom-Flat (FFF) coincides with the shelf break, with a fall much sharper than other places along the west coast. This break also coincides with the western extremity of the carbonate platform. The stratigraphic succession and petrology of the FFF bear strong resemblance to that of the Seychelles and Mascarene Plateau. We discuss the tectonic implications of such resemblance, and the possible reasons for the remarkably low bathymetric relief of the FFF.","Shelf break,WCMI,Fifty-Fathom-Flat (FFF),Swath bathymetry,Tectonic origin,"
"simulated seasonal oceanographic changes and their implication for the small pelagic fisheries in the java sea, indonesia","2023","Small pelagic fisheries in the Java Sea (JS) contributes to about 26.6% of the total marine fisheries resources, where their spatial-temporal variation is controlled by seasonal oceanographic changes. This study aims to investigate a relationship between seasonal reversal circulation and number of light-fishing vessels (VBD) dispersion that capture small pelagic fishes, using multi-datasets from a regional ocean circulation model, satellite-derived datasets, and pelagic fish landing datasets between 2010 and 2020. The model demonstrates that main axis of eastward (westward) monsoon current that brings warmer and fresher (cooler and saltier) water, confines much closer along the northern Java (southern Kalimantan) during the northwest (southeast) monsoon period. These changes are followed unprecedentedly by southward (northward) shift of VBD and high abundance of euryhaline (stenohaline) fish species. This new evidence implies that reversal monsoon current and surface component of Makassar Throughflow play a significant role on delineating potential small pelagic fishing ground and fish productions.","Small pelagic fishery,CROCO model,Satellite-derived dataset,Monsoon current,Java sea,"
"mesoscale modeling of smoke transport over the southeast asian maritime continent: interplay of sea breeze, trade wind, typhoon, and topography","2013","The online-coupled Weather Research and Forecasting model with Chemistry (WRFchem) is used to simulate the transport of smoke particles over the Southeast Asian Maritime Continent during September–October 2006. In this period, dry conditions associated with the moderate El Niño event caused the largest regional biomass burning outbreak since 1997. Smoke emission in WRFchem is specified according to the Fire Locating and Modeling of Burning Emissions (FLAMBE) database derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) fire products. The modeled smoke transport pathway is found to be consistent with the MODIS true color images and measured mass concentration of surface PM10 (particulate matter with diameter less than 10μm). The interplay of sea/land breezes, typhoons and storms over the subtropical western Pacific Ocean, trade winds, and topographic effects, can be clearly seen in the model simulation. The most severe smoke events in 1–5 October 2006 are found to be associated with the meteorological responses to the typhoon Xangsane (#18) over the western subtropical Pacific Ocean, which moved smoke from Sumatra eastward in the lower troposphere (below 700hPa), forming smoke layers mixed with and above the boundary layer clouds over Borneo. In contrast, the second largest week-long smoke transport event of 15–18 October 2006 was associated with the seasonal monsoonal transition period, during which smoke plumes were wide spread over the 5°S–5°N zone as a result of (a) the near surface divergence coupled with the 700hPa bifurcation of wind (flowing both to the west and to the east), and (b) the near-surface southeasterly and easterly winds along the equator transporting smoke from Borneo to Sumatra and Peninsular Malaysia. Analysis of data from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarisation (CALIOP) shows that smoke particles in October 2006 were primarily located within 3.5km above the surface. Smoke particles contributed roughly half of the total aerosol extinction retrieved by CALIOP. Results suggest that the smoke injection height in the model should be set lower than the 2–5km commonly used in transport simulations; smoke release at ~0.8km instead of 2km above surface gives a consistently better match to CALIOP observations. Numerical experiments further show that the Titiwangsa Mountains in Malaysia Peninsula and Tama Abu Mountains in Borneo have significant impacts on smoke transport and the surface air quality in the vicinity.","Sea breeze,Trade wind,Typhoon,Southeast Asian Maritime Continent,Smoke particles,"

Differently from traditional approaches that only use LSTM for trajectory modeling, we exploit the 1D Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN) to embed position features at multiple temporal scales. Moreover, we propose a two-stage graph attention mechanism, which can better describe mutual interactions among pedestrians in the crowd. Additionally, group influences at every time step are taken into account as well. The overall framework is designed using a hierarchical manner, and trained using the Wasserstein distance.

"fault diagnosis of regenerative thermal oxidizer system via dynamic uncertain causality graph integrated with early anomaly detection","2023","Regenerative thermal oxidizers (RTO) serve as pivotal equipment for the treatment of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). However, a diversity of faults of the RTO system may threaten personnel safety and lead to unscheduled downtime. In this work, we develop a traceability inference method based on dynamic uncertain causality graph (DUCG) to identify root fault cause of RTO at early anomaly alarm. A general expert knowledge base for the fault diagnosis of RTO system is constructed. And the anomaly alarm thresholds are modified according to historical data with n-sigma rules to improve the diagnostic accuracy. Results on different cases show advantages in both triggering early anomaly alarms and avoiding invalid alarms, which is crucial to improve the fault inference accuracy. By applying our method to 35 fault cases of a real RTO for pharmaceutical VOCs treatment, the fault detection rate reaches 94.29%, and the fault inference accuracy is 82.86%. The two scores are 3% and 21% higher than those with the conventional DUCG (with fixed alarms), respectively. This remarkable improvement underlines the significance of our proposed method for RTO maintenance, and it is expected to assure the system’s operational stability and reliability.","Anomaly detection,Regenerative thermal oxidizer,Dynamic uncertain causality graph,Fault diagnosis,"
"observation needs for climate information, prediction and application: capabilities of existing and future observing systems","2010","The demand for long-term, sustained, reliable data and derived information on climate and its changes has never been greater than today. Long-term, well-calibrated, global observations of Essential Climate Variables (ECV) such as air temperature, precipitation, and sea-surface temperature are critical for defining the evolving state of the Earth's climate. Observing systems routinely collect much of the required data covering 49 ECVs, and significant progress has been made in coverage and technological capability over the two decades since the Second World Climate Conference. However, many key regions and climatic zones remain poorly observed, and gaps are widening in some cases. Supporting infrastructures for data stewardship and analysis are largely in place but require strengthening, while those for linking with socio-economic data and for providing user-oriented information services require more substantial development. The current capabilities are summarized, and further actions are identified to ensure that climate observation activities more fully meet the needs of science and society. The Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) was established in 1992 with the goal of providing comprehensive information on the total climate system, involving a multidisciplinary range of physical, chemical and biological observations of the atmosphere, oceans and land. GCOS is a “system of systems” that builds on the climate-relevant components of existing observing systems, and relies almost entirely upon national efforts to maintain and enhance those systems. Contributing systems include the World Meteorological Organization Global Observing System (GOS) for meteorology, its Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW) for atmospheric composition, the Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS), led by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC), and the Global Terrestrial Observing System (GTOS), led by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). GCOS itself is the climate observing system within the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) developed under the auspices of the Group on Earth Observations (GEO). The established in situ networks and space-based components must be sustained and operated with ongoing attention to data quality in accordance with the GCOS Climate Monitoring Principles; enhancements must be made for some types of observations; the exchange of observations and delivery of data and information to users must be ensured; reprocessing and reanalysis must be strengthened; and national and international coordination must be improved. The consequence of not meeting these requirements would be to seriously compromise the information on, and predictions of, climate variability and change. Detailed information on GCOS and the datasets that are produced as a result of GCOS observing activities can be found at the Global Observing Systems Information Center (GOSIC) at http://gosic.org.","GEOSS,climate observations,GEO,ECV,GAW,GTOS,GOOS,essential climate variables,GCOS,"
"improved visualization of large temporal series for the evaluation of good environmental status","2019","Passive acoustic monitoring of underwater sounds is an emerging discipline that can be used to guarantee that anthropogenic noise meets acceptable limits, to detect the presence of cetacean species, and to ensure sustainable exploitation of our oceans and seas. In this scenario, graphical representation techniques play a key role in helping to reveal seasonal structures of human made noises. Nevertheless, for very long temporal series, it might be challenging to find a graphic visualization technique that allows representing a time range that is long enough to capture these seasonal events, while at the same time preserving short isolated events. We propose a framework for the creation of such visualization techniques and analyze the different stages involved: data reduction, color encoding, and signal processing on graphs. All of this is applied to data from deployments in two marine protected areas in order to provide an acoustic panorama and identify seasonal events.","Submarine environment,Hough transform,Ambient noise characterization,Data reduction,Surveillance,Big data visualization,Acoustic images,"

"spatiotemporal variability in bio-optical characteristics of the southwestern tropical indian ocean during boreal summer: biophysical influences","2022","The bio-optical characteristics of the surface ocean play a pivotal role in radiative transfer and photosynthetic carbon fixation. To examine spatiotemporal variability of bio-optical properties in the tropical Indian Ocean, a 10-day time-series comparative study was made at one fixed and 3 variable stations in the southwestern tropical Indian Ocean (SWTIO), and 4-stations in the Equatorial Indian Ocean (EIO) during June 2014. A total of 24 hyperspectral radiometer profiles were collected along with physicochemical parameters and phytoplankton pigments analysis. A negative sea level anomaly (SLA), higher precipitation, a more stable mixed layer, and higher buoyancy frequency (N2) were observed in SWTIO compared to EIO. The deep chlorophyll maxima (DCM) in SWTIO were characterised by deep biomass maxima (DBM) whereas in the EIO it was due to deep photoacclimation maxima (DAM). The photosynthetically available radiation (PAR) profiles were obtained by integrating downwelling irradiance from 400 to 700 nm suggesting that the SWTIO had a greater abundance of optically active substances (OAS) than the EIO. Surface chlorophyll a (Chl-a) was found to have significant relationships with phytoplankton absorption coefficient (aph(443)). Chl-a-specific phytoplankton absorption coefficients (a*ph(443)), total absorption coefficient (at(443)), and particulate backscattering (bbp(555)) were also related to Chl-a implying that the phytoplankton was in growth/active phase. The time-series variability of the phytoplankton and changes in the photosynthetic pigments (PSP) to photoprotective pigments (PPP) ratio at SWTIO suggested phytoplankton community shift during 5th to 7th days. Microplankton percent-abundances showed distinct linear relationships with Chl-a and bbp(555) implying that carbon fixation per unit Chl-a was higher in microplankton than in nano and picoplankton at SWTIO. The in situ Chl-a, aph(443), adg(443), Kd(490) and C¯ pd were used to validate the various empirical algorithms available as well as the satellite-retrieved data. The MODIS and VIIRS data correlated moderately. This study would help towards improving regional optimized algorithms for OAS and provide a baseline understanding of the scale of variability of primary production and carbon flux from space. In addition, this would contribute valuable bio-optical data from an under-sampled geographical area.","Subsurface stratification,Light absorption,Tropical Indian Ocean,Particulate backscattering,Deep chlorophyll maxima,Phytoplankton pigments,"
"textual risk mining for maritime situational awareness","2014","In this paper, we propose an auxiliary Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) integrated system for maritime situational awareness (MSA) operations. We bring into account a new and influential asset - human intuition and perception - to the existing semi-automated decision support systems that mostly rely on numerical data collected by electronic sensors or cameras located either directly on the vessels or in the maritime command-and-control centers. For our project, we gathered weekly textual reports spanning twelve months from the United States Worldwide Threats to Shipping Reports repository that belongs to the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), We considered the maritime incident reports written by human operators as a valuable and accessible unstructured textual input source in which a span of text1 is called â€œriskâ€ if it expresses one of the following kinds of vessel incidents: fired, robbed, boarded, hijacked, attacked, chased, approached, kidnapped, boarding attempted, suspiciously approached or clashed with. Our approach benefits from probability distributions of some useful features annotated based on a list of lexicons that contain expressions denoting vessel types, risks types, risk associates, maritime geographical locations, dates and times. These distributions are captured and used to anchor the span of â€œrisksâ€ as they are described in the textual reports. After some preprocessing steps that include tokenization, named entity extraction and part-of-speech tagging, the textual risk mining system applies a variety of sequence classification algorithms, e.g., Conditional Random Fields, Conditional Markov Models and Hidden Markov Models in order to compare the risk classification performance.

Resilience and vulnerability are representative indicators in the performance analysis of transportation systems. A large number of related studies have emerged in recent years. Therefore, this paper reviews the recent progress in the study of vulnerability and resilience. Specific definitions of resilience and vulnerability are first given from the perspective of transportation system’s supply and demand. Other related concepts of transportation system performance (TSP) are also discussed including reliability, robustness, survivability and risk. The existing studies can be divided into two aspects, i.e., the traditional topological structure and system structure analysis. The study of topology structure mainly revolves around graph theory, which is also the cornerstone of TSP research. In recent years, advances in data analysis and model simulation technology have led to an increasing number of studies considering the overall transportation system structure. The related metrics and research methods are carefully analyzed and summarized from qualitative and quantitative perspectives.

"understanding altimetry signals in the northeastern ligurian sea using a multi-platform approach","2019","During the Long-Term Glider Mission for Environmental Characterization 2016 sea trial, carried out in the eastern Ligurian Sea (Northwestern Mediterranean Sea), two gliders rated to a maximum depth of 1000 m operated continuously from 3 May 2016–27 June 2016. When possible, glider tracks were synchronized with the contemporaneous footprints of the Jason-2, SARAL/AltiKa and CryoSat-2 altimeters. Temperature and salinity measured by the gliders that were co-localised with the altimeter passages were used to calculate along-track dynamic heights (DH). The latter were then compared with the altimeters’ near real-time absolute dynamic topography (ADT) measurements. ADT and DH values showed very similar, but shifted patterns, suggesting that gliders had sampled the same structures but at different times. Average surface absolute geostrophic velocities at the time of glider transit were used in a novel relocation technique to reposition glider measurements where they would have been at the time of the altimeter passage. The relocation increases the correlation between datasets to a value close to 1 and reduces the RMSE of an order of magnitude, also when the time-difference between measurements was greater than 3 days. The sea level spatial and temporal variability is attributed to the presence of meanders generated by the baroclinic instability of the Liguro- Provençal Current (LPC). These meanders are characterized by a 38 km amplitude and 0.12 m s−1 average propagation speed that are confirmed by the larger scale ocean colour measurements and are in agreement with those previously described in the literature. We found that the presence of LPC meanders in along-track ADT and DH measurements is evidenced by a decrease in sea level when profiles sampled the Modified Atlantic Water, and an increase in sea level when measurements sampled the adjacent waters of Tyrrhenian Sea origin. The relocation technique introduced here is expected to improve future altimetry-glider comparisons, as similar validation experiments were considered possible only when glider and altimetry measurements were near synoptic, and collected up to one day from each other.","Near real-time altimetry,Gliders,Liguro-Provençal Current meanders,Ligurian sea,Glider relocation,"

"a history of vegetation, sediment and nutrient dynamics at tivoli north bay, hudson estuary, new york","2012","We conduct a stratigraphic paleoecological investigation at a Hudson River National Estuarine Research Reserve (HRNERR) site, Tivoli Bays, spanning the past 1100 years. Marsh sediment cores were analyzed for ecosystem changes using multiple proxies, including pollen, spores, macrofossils, charcoal, sediment bulk chemistry, and stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes. The results reveal climatic shifts such as the warm and dry Medieval Warm Period (MWP) followed by the cooler Little Ice Age (LIA), along with significant anthropogenic influence on the watershed ecosystem. A five-fold expansion of invasive species, including Typha angustifolia and Phragmites australis, is documented along with marked changes in sediment composition and nutrient input. During the last century, a ten-fold sedimentation rate increase due to land-use changes is observed. The large magnitude of shifts in vegetation, sedimentation, and nutrients during the last few centuries suggest that human activities have made the greatest impact to the marshes of the Hudson Estuary during the last millennium. Climate variability and ecosystem changes similar to those observed at other marshes in northeastern and mid-Atlantic estuaries, attest to the widespread regional signature recorded at Tivoli Bays.","nitrogen cycle,tidal marshes,invasive species,New York,Little Ice Age,Medieval Warm period,paleoecology,stable isotopes,climate change,European settlement,palynology,"

"classification of daily heavy precipitation patterns and associated synoptic types in the campania region (southern italy)","2023","Using a 20-year (2002−2021) dataset of daily precipitation collected by 107 rain gauges in the period from October to May, this study introduces a classification of the main heavy precipitation spatial patterns for the Campania Region (southern Italy). To pursue this aim, we apply a cluster analysis on the most relevant principal modes extracted from a principal component analysis of the between-day correlation matrix. The characteristics of the identified patterns, as well as their interannual and monthly distribution, are presented and discussed. Moreover, using global and regional reanalysis products, we have determined the large-scale and mesoscale atmospheric circulation types associated with heavy precipitation patterns. The heavy precipitation episodes are generally triggered by an upper level trough approaching the southern Italy from west and promoting a very moist southwesterly flow. They have been clustered into six different patterns. The first four exhibit a rainfall amount distribution strongly connected with the orography of the investigated region. In such scenarios, the orographic lifting, the low-level wind convergence induced by the orography and the transport of moisture from local sources (the western and the southern Mediterranean) and from distant regions (the Atlantic and the Africa tropical areas) can be regarded as the primary forcing of heavy rainfall. In the other two patterns, the highest precipitation is generally observed in the coastal areas (Gulfs of Naples and Salerno) and in the northwestern side of the region (Caserta district), respectively. In such circumstances, the abundant precipitation is closely linked to convective activity over the Tyrrhenian Sea, which is sustained by a low-level convergence and, in the sixth pattern, by a moisture plume coming from the tropics. The results of this study provide new insights about the links between torrential precipitation spatial distribution and atmospheric circulation schemes in the southern Italy and promise to add a useful contribution for civil protection activities related to the management of environmental risks.","Rainfall spatial patterns,Atmospheric circulation types,Heavy precipitation events,Cluster analysis,"

As a result, we experiment with pre-trained CNNs based on the Inception and ResNet architectures to perform ship classification.

"many-objective maritime path planning for dynamic and uncertain environments","2021","Weather-impacted asset routing is a complex problem, involving nonlinear, non-convex costs due to spatiotemporally varying uncertainty of weather parameters over a finite time horizon. To this end, we have augmented a previously published tool for multiobjective planning and asset routing, termed TMPLAR, with a new approximate dynamic programming-based Pareto optimization (NAPO) algorithm. TMPLAR is a mixed-initiative tool to solve the asset routing problem in dynamic and uncertain environments. It is built upon multi-objective dynamic programming algorithms to route assets in a timely fashion, while considering objectives, such as fuel efficiency, voyage time, distance, and adherence to real world constraints (asset vehicle limits, navigator-specified deadlines, etc.). The asset routing problem is exacerbated by the need to address multiple conflicting objectives, spatial and temporal uncertainty associated with the weather and multiple constraints on asset operation. The NAPO algorithm optimizes weather-based objectives in a reasonable amount of time, optimizing arrival and departure times at waypoints, asset speed and bearing. The key algorithmic contribution is a fast approximate method for substantially containing the computational complexity by generating the Pareto-front of the multi-objective shortest path problem for networks with stochastic non-convex edge costs, utilizing approximate dynamic programming and clustering techniques. The proposed algorithm is validated and we compare its performance with the new approach to multi-objective A* (NAMOA*).","key algorithmic contribution,published tool,Clustering algorithms,termed TMPLAR,vehicle routing,voyage time,Approximation algorithms,weather-based objectives,multiobjective shortest path problem,route assets,multiobjective planning,weather parameters,asset vehicle limits,asset operation,multiple conflicting objectives,asset routing problem,mixed-initiative tool,Aerodynamics,ships,complex problem,nonconvex costs,dynamic programming,asset speed,uncertain environments,graph theory,temporal uncertainty,NAPO algorithm,finite time horizon,path planning,considering objectives,search problems,Pareto optimisation,Routing,departure times,Uncertainty,computational complexity,spatial uncertainty,approximate dynamic programming-based Pareto optimization algorithm,weather-impacted asset routing,clustering techniques,nonconvex edge costs,Tools,approximation theory,Heuristic algorithms,dynamic environments,multiobjective dynamic programming algorithms,objective maritime path planning,"

"gas - escape features along the trzebiatów fault offshore poland: evidence for a leaking petroleum system","2023","New 2D high-resolution seismic and hydro-acoustic data demonstrate the presence of methane in the shallow sediments and its origin in the Pomeranian Bight, south of the Baltic Sea area. Various shallow gas features including chimneys, bright spots, acoustic blanking, pockmarks, and polarity reversal were identified in the Gryfice block, along the inverted Trzebiatów fault zone. Structural and stratigraphic interpretation with support of seismic attributes shows the potential of fluid migration pathways from the Upper Triassic formation reservoirs to shallow sediments below the seafloor. It also helps in the explanation of how this natural gas escapes to the sea bottom. Amplitude-vs-offset (AVO) analysis proved free gas existence in the potential Upper Triassic reservoir, and helped locate free gas deposits within sediments. Hydro-acoustic data illustrated the gas chimneys’ anomalies and the corresponding free gas accumulation in Pleistocene to Quaternary successions. Leaking of gas to the seafloor was also proved by the exposure of pockmarks on multibeam (bathymetry) data at the seafloor. We combine seismic, hydro-acoustic data, and information on petroleum system from previous studies to explain the signatures of free gas and its migration from lower reservoirs to shallow sediments.","Hydro-acoustics,Petroleum system,Shallow gas,Reflection seismic,Fluid escape,"

"remote imaging of internal solitons in the coastal ocean","2001","During a combined in situ and airborne remote sensing exercise off Oceanside, CA, a Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI) observed alongshore lineations, which were associated with an internal soliton packet accompanying a tidally generated internal solitary wave (solibore). The soliton packets were most evident in the images at green wavelengths, which penetrate the deepest into the water column, and only weakly evident at optical wavelengths with shallower penetration. We believe that this is the first observation of internal soliton packets determined from remotely sensed upwelled radiance. We hypothesize that the lineations were produced by changes in the upwelling radiance from the interior of the water column, not by changes in surface reflectance. Using a simulation, it is demonstrated that such lineations can be produced by vertical modulation of the inherent optical properties (IOPs) during the passage of the internal soliton packet. Since surface manifestations are not always present, this opens the potential for broadly based inventories of internal solitons in coastal waters.","Soliton,Optical properties,Internal waves,Reflectance,"
"gis-based identification of spatial variables enhancing heat and poor air quality in urban areas","2012","Due to anthropogenic climate change heat waves are expected to occur more frequently in the future, which might cause adverse health effects for urban population. Especially the combination of high temperatures and poor air quality impinges on the well-being of man. This accentuates the need for assessing the health risks of residents regarding air pollutants and anomalously high summer air temperatures. However, comprehensive information on the spatial and temporal distribution of temperature and particulate matter (PM) concentration in cities are presently difficult to obtain since only few measurement sites exist. In order to identify hot spots with high health risks for distinct groups of urban population, measurement campaigns were carried out, capturing the spatial distribution of temperature and PM concentrations in the City of Aachen, Germany (pop. 245,000). Several locations were selected to examine spatial influences such as topography, building density, vegetation and traffic on temperature and PM. The findings permit the detection of urban environmental variables that contribute to both temperature enhancement and poor air quality. Those variables were used as spatial predictors for the identification of possible hot spots inside and outside the area of field measurements. The zones of enhanced risks of high air temperature and PM levels were detected by means of GIS based geo-statistic modeling. These areas were mainly identified in the inner city, which is characterized by a dense building structure and heavy traffic. A chemical characterization of different PM fractions complements the GIS based investigations. The analysis of toxicologically relevant components provides information on air quality at urban, suburban and rural sites. The results of the chemical analyses support the results obtained from geo-statistical modeling. It reveals high concentrations of health relevant airborne species like metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons within the zone of enhanced risk for the coincidence of temperature stress and PM pollution.","Heat,Air pollution,Health,Particulate matter,Climate change,GIS,"
"multi-scale analysis reveals changing distribution patterns and the influence of social structure on the habitat use of an endangered marine predator, the sperm whale physeter macrocephalus in the western mediterranean sea","2020","The habitat use of marine megafauna emerges from the complex interplay between access to patchy and variable food resources and several intrinsic biological factors, such as the interaction with conspecifics and offspring care, resulting in dynamic distribution patterns. Quantifying species' relationships with the underlying environment is further complicated by the scale-dependent nature of these processes. Multi-scale analyses that incorporate aspects of a species' biology and build on large datasets are therefore required to understand long-term distribution and inform appropriate management measures. In this study, we use monitoring data collected over two study periods (2003–2008 and 2012–2018) to assess the habitat use, trend in local occurrence, and change in distribution of sperm whales, Physeter macrocephalus, around the Balearic Islands (Spain), one of the few recognised breeding and feeding grounds for the ‘Endangered’ population in the Mediterranean Sea. Moreover, we investigate the differences in the habitat use of single animals and groups, to explore intra-specific niche partitioning in this highly social but behaviourally dimorphic species. Results suggest that overall the occurrence of sperm whales in the area has been increasing over time. Animals were found to associate with distinct bathymetric features, but the mechanisms generating these relationships, and the underlying oceanographic processes within this habitat, remained uncertain. Sperm whale distribution also underwent a significant shift between the two study periods, with an increased occurrence in the Mallorca channel and north of Menorca, which further points towards a dynamic use of the broader bathymetric range preferred around the archipelago. Finally, our analyses highlighted that single animals and groups used areas with different characteristics, with groups preferring deeper, warmer waters characterised by lower sea level anomaly, which resulted in some fine-scale spatial segregation. The results of this study shed light on the mechanisms underpinning the biogeography and complex social system of the species, and support the design of targeted conservation measures in this important breeding and feeding ground.","Mediterranean sea,Distribution shift,Balearic archipelago,Sperm whale,Long-term monitoring,Habitat modeling,"
"sigmar: ensuring integrity and authenticity of maritime systems using digital signatures","2021","Distributed maritime bridge systems are customary standard equipment on todayâ€™s commercial shipping and cruising vessels.

Extending the existing IEC 61162-450 protocol makes it is possible to build a backward-compatible authentication mechanism that prevents common cyber attacks.

"reconstructing high-resolution climate using ct scanning of unsectioned stalagmites: a case study identifying the mid-holocene onset of the mediterranean climate in southern iberia","2015","The forcing mechanisms responsible for the mid-Holocene onset of the Mediterranean-type climate in south-western Europe are currently unclear, but understanding these is critical for accurate climate projections under future greenhouse gas warming. Additionally, regional studies that present conflicting patterns for the onset and advancement of Mediterranean climatic conditions complicate definitively ascribing causality. Here, we use a new high resolution stalagmite density record obtained non-destructively using Computed Tomography (CT scanning) to reconstruct southern Iberian climate between 9.3 and 2.9 ka BP. We suggest that stalagmite density can be used as a water-excess proxy, with lower densities associated with more variable drip rates, possibly reflecting increased seasonality consistent with expectations from previous studies of speleothem textures and crystal fabrics. Our results reveal an early Holocene humid interval and mid-Holocene year-round aridity that preceded the onset of Mediterranean climate at 5.3 ka BP in southern Iberia. Using this new dataset combined with previously published results, we link the gradual advancement of the Mediterranean climate to the southward migration of the North Atlantic Subtropical High induced by an orbitally driven decrease in Northern Hemisphere insolation. Future anthropogenic warming could result in a reversal of this trend, a northward migration of the North Atlantic Subtropical High, and a return to year-round aridity in south-western Europe.","CT scanning,Speleothem,NASH,Palaeoclimatology,Mediterranean,Holocene,"

"joint stochastic prediction of vessel kinematics and destination based on a maritime traffic graph","2022","Maritime traffic increases every year, and therefore also the amount of traffic data from the Automatic Identification System (AIS). Utilizing these data on traffic patterns and possible destinations for long-term vessel prediction is here an important way of gaining maritime situational awareness (MSA) for use in the decision making in autonomous ships, such as collision avoidance algorithms, which can reduce collision risk during voyage. In this article, we present a destination inference method based on piece-wise Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) processes for predicting vessel motions along common traffic lanes toward a set of destinations. The mean velocities of the processes are inferred through the creation of a maritime graph that represents the major traffic patterns in the area of consideration. After using an OU process for prediction along major sea lanes, the Equilibrium Reverting Velocity (ERV) bridging model is used to enable convergence of the prediction towards considered destinations. Then, based on the OU process and ERV bridging model for prediction, Bayesian inference is used to estimate the posterior destination distribution. Tested on a real-time AIS dataset, the method is shown to perform better than current state-of-the art methods in destination inference as it indirectly takes land and passed destinations into account.","Traffic control,mean velocities,Prediction algorithms,vessel kinematics,Bayes methods,equilibrium reverting velocity bridging model,Destination inference,traffic patterns,posterior destination distribution,Stochastic processes,Predictive models,traffic lanes,sea lanes,maritime situational awareness,long-term vessel prediction,piece-wise Ornstein-Uhlenbeck,Mechatronics,ships,marine safety,automatic identification system,marine engineering,stochastic processes,joint stochastic prediction,collision risk,maritime graph,real-time AIS dataset,maritime graphs,traffic data,Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes,vessel motions,maritime traffic graph,decision making,collision avoidance algorithms,Bayesian inference,Real-time systems,graph theory,ERV bridging model,telecommunication traffic,inference mechanisms,traffic engineering computing,Navigation,collision avoidance,OU process,AIS data,destination inference method,autonomous ships,"
"estimation of the contributions of the sources driving pm2.5 levels in a central mediterranean coastal town","2018","Receptor modelling techniques are widely used in order to identify the main natural and anthropogenic processes driving aerosol levels at a receptor. In this work, Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) was used to apportion PM2.5 levels at a traffic site (Msida) located in a coastal town. 180 filters collected throughout a yearly sampling campaign conducted in 2016, were chemically characterized by light absorbance analysis, x-ray fluorescence and ion chromatography in order to determine the concentrations of black carbon, 17 elements and 5 ions, respectively. The resulting chemical data base was used in conjunction with PMF in order to identify the 7 components affecting the PM2.5 levels at the receptor site. Six of these sources are considered to be typical of the atmospheric composition of coastal traffic sites: traffic (27.3%), ammonium sulfate (23.6%), Saharan dust (15%), aged sea salt (12.7%), shipping (5%) and fresh sea salt (4.6%). This is the first time that such a study was carried out in Malta and helps in understanding the aerosol pollution climate of the Central Mediterranean, which is still relatively understudied when compared to the Eastern and Western Mediterranean. Furthermore, we have isolated a factor exclusive to Malta: the fireworks component, which is responsible for 2.9% of the PM2.5 and which has health implications due to its chemical composition. The results of this work should also serve to guide the policy makers in achieving the necessary emission reductions in order to achieve the WHO guideline for PM2.5 by 2020.","PM,Positive matrix factorization,Natural aerosol sources,Anthropogenic aerosol sources,Source apportionment,Central mediterranean,"
"influence of climate variability on anchovy reproductive timing off northern chile","2016","We investigated the relationship between environmental variables and the Gonadosomatic Monthly Mean (GMM) index of anchovy (Engraulis ringens) to understand how the environment affects the dynamics of anchovy reproductive timing. The data examined corresponds to biological information collected from samples of the landings off northern Chile (18°21′S, 24°00′S) during the period 1990–2010. We used the Humboldt Current Index (HCI) and the Multivariate ENSO Index (MEI), which combine several physical-oceanographic factors in the Tropical and South Pacific regions. Using the GMM index, we studied the dynamics of anchovy reproductive timing at different intervals of length, specifically females with a length between 11.5 and 14cm (medium class) and longer than 14cm (large class). Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Mobile Average (SARIMA) was used to predict missing observations. The trends of the environment and reproductive indexes were explored via the Breaks For Additive Season and Trend (BFAST) statistical technique and the relationship between these indexes via cross-correlation functions (CCF) analysis. Our results showed that the habitat of anchovy switched from cool to warm condition, which also influenced gonad development. This was revealed by two and three significant changes (breaks) in the trend of the HCI and MEI indexes, and two significant breaks in the GMM of each time series of anchovy females (medium and large). Negative cross-correlation between the MEI index and GMM of medium and large class females was found, indicating that as the environment gets warmer (positive value of MEI) a decrease in the reproductive activity of anchovy can be expected. Correlation between the MEI index and larger females was stronger than with medium females. Additionally, our results indicate that the GMM index of anchovy for both length classes reaches two maximums per year; the first from August to September and the second from December to January. The intensity (maximum GMM values at rise point) of reproductive activity was not equal though, with the August–September peak being the highest. We also discuss how the synchronicity between environment and reproductive timing, the negative correlation found between MEI and GMM indexes, and the two increases per year of anchovy GMM relate to previous studies. Based on these findings we propose ways to advance in the understanding of how anchovy synchronize gonad development with the environment.","Length,Reproduction,Anchovy,Environment,Northern Chile,Humboldt Current System,"

"a multi-proxy approach to late holocene fluctuations of tungnahryggsjökull glaciers in the tröllaskagi peninsula (northern iceland)","2019","The Tröllaskagi Peninsula in northern Iceland hosts more than a hundred small glaciers that have left a rich terrestrial record of Holocene climatic fluctuations in their forelands. Traditionally, it has been assumed that most of the Tröllaskagi glaciers reached their Late Holocene maximum extent during the Little Ice Age (LIA). However, there is evidence of slightly more advanced pre-LIA positions. LIA moraines from Iceland have been primary dated mostly through lichenometric dating, but the limitations of this technique do not allow dating of glacial advances prior to the 18th or 19th centuries. The application of 36Cl Cosmic-Ray Exposure (CRE) dating to Tungnahryggsjökull moraine sequences in Vesturdalur and Austurdalur (central Tröllaskagi) has revealed a number of pre-LIA glacial advances at ~400 and ~700 CE, and a number of LIA advances in the 15th and 17th centuries, the earliest LIA advances dated so far in Tröllaskagi. This technique hence shows that the LIA chronology in Tröllaskagi agrees with that of other European areas such as the Alps or the Mediterranean mountains. The combined use of lichenometric dating, aerial photographs, satellite images and fieldwork shows that the regional colonization lag of the commonly used lichen species Rhizocarpon geographicum is longer than previously assumed. For exploratory purposes, an alternative lichen species (Porpidia soredizodes) has been tested for lichenometric dating, estimating a tentative growth rate of 0.737 mm yr−1.","Lichenometric dating,Late Holocene glacier evolution,Little Ice Age,Tröllaskagi,Iceland,Cl Cosmic-Ray Exposure dating,"

"potential impact of long-life environmental sonobuoys on littoral asw","2009","The focus of military activity has recently shifted from large area engagements to regional conflicts. Consequently, supportive Naval maritime operations have continued to evolve toward littoral warfare in complicated shallow-water, near-shore environments. This evolution requires new sensors, advanced Concept of Operations, and improved data-analysis capabilities, among others. Planning operations in these harsh-environment areas is difficult because accurate predictions of tactical sensor performance depend on detailed knowledge of the local environmental conditions. Tactical mission planning is thus seldom optimal or efficient, often resulting in coverage gaps, increased risk, and reduced mission success. According to a Navy Mission Need Statement, 'Air ASW tactical execution, especially in littoral seas, requires in-situ environmental updates for preflight mission planning. In the conduct of ASW operations, an urgent need for explicit knowledge of environmental variables is required to optimize the effectiveness of operational acoustic sensors, as well as acoustic sensors in development ' The Naval Air Systems Command has considered extended-life environmental sonobuoy concepts to better characterize the littoral environment. Most designs contain a thermistor string to measure ocean temperatures and also hydrophones to measure ambient noise. This type of complex sonobuoy would be more expensive than a traditional single-measurement AXBT but it could provide a more thorough littoral environment assessment. This paper examines the trade-off between increased sensor complexity and improved ASW performance, in terms of cumulative detection probability. Some advantages of an extended-life combined thermistor string/hydrophone approach, compared to AXBTs and tactical hydrophones, are: 1) higher accuracy of the raw data; 2) temporal averaging to smooth out fluctuations; 3) extended area coverage during drift; 4) less chance for surface temperature anomalies (e.g., mixed-layer-depth errors) caused by various electronic and mechanical variability upon impact; 5) opportunities to discover thermal and acoustic feature boundaries during drift; and 6) less need to re-seed thus allowing longer tactical mission times. These advantages are evaluated relative to the following disadvantages: 1) increased cost; 2) potential drift outside the mission area; and 3) need for increased battery life for longer durations. The analysis is tempered by considering how a potential new system might be used. One assumption is that an environmental sampling decision aid is available to determine the minimum number and best initial locations of drifting sensors to meet performance objectives. The November 2007 Requirements Document from the Naval Oceanographic Office states ?Sampling guidance: Development of guidance on the best way to deploy, spatially and temporally, observation systems in order to meet various forecasting, model assimilation, and model evaluation objectives is needed.? Work in this area is reported in this Oceans '09 Conference in a paper entitled ?Uncertainty-based Adaptive AXBT Sampling with SPOTS?, which addresses optimal sampling requirements. For this trade-off analysis, temperature data from watersampling flights in the Sea of Japan off the east coast of Korea were used to simulate expected capability of a long-term drifting thermistor string. Then optimal initial positions for three notional buoys were determined followed by a simulation of drifting positions and data collected over 12 days. Ocean nowcasts were constructed and used to determine acoustic performance of a notional tactical sonobuoy field. The analysis shows that a drifting extended-life thermistor string can provide significant improvement in environmental characterization, tactical planning, and ASW detection performance.","Acoustic measurements,Sea measurements,military systems,Predictive models,Sonar equipment,Sampling methods,Ocean temperature,Noise measurement,littoral ASW,operational acoustic sensors,Thermistors,Temperature measurement,Acoustic sensors,long-life environmental sonobuoys,"

"on small satellites for oceanography: a survey","2016","The recent explosive growth of small satellite operations driven primarily from an academic or pedagogical need, has demonstrated the viability of commercial-off-the-shelf technologies in space. They have also leveraged and shown the need for development of compatible sensors primarily aimed for Earth observation tasks including monitoring terrestrial domains, communications and engineering tests. However, one domain that these platforms have not yet made substantial inroads into, is in the ocean sciences. Remote sensing has long been within the repertoire of tools for oceanographers to study dynamic large scale physical phenomena, such as gyres and fronts, bio-geochemical process transport, primary productivity and process studies in the coastal ocean. We argue that the time has come for micro and nano-satellites (with mass smaller than 100kg and 2–3 year development times) designed, built, tested and flown by academic departments, for coordinated observations with robotic assets in situ. We do so primarily by surveying SmallSat missions oriented towards ocean observations in the recent past, and in doing so, we update the current knowledge about what is feasible in the rapidly evolving field of platforms and sensors for this domain. We conclude by proposing a set of candidate ocean observing missions with an emphasis on radar-based observations, with a focus on Synthetic Aperture Radar.","Ocean observation,Sensors,Small satellites,"

"distribution and coalification patterns in canadian bituminous and anthracite coals","1989","Canadian resources of bituminous and anthracite coal occur in six of ten provinces and in the Yukon and Northwest Territories. These higher-rank coals are found in 12 of the 16 coal-bearing basins within Canada. For some of these basins, knowledge of rank and coalification patterns is limited; in others, it is extensive. Coalification patterns were examined in detail for two areas: the southern end of the Canadian Rocky Mountain coal belt which is underlain by the coal-bearing Kootenay Group and the Maritimes Basin which is underlain by several coal-bearing formations of Pennsylvanian (Late Carboniferous) age. In the southern Rockies, reflectances on coal range from 0.61 to 2.65% R0 max, which represent high-volatile B bituminous coal to semianthracite. In general, there is an increase in rank from SE to NW and from NE to SW. Superimposed on this pattern are several anomalies. At several locations, ranks change rapidly over short distances. An example is in the Mount Allan syncline, where the reflectances in the Kootenay section on the SW vertical limb range from 0.68 to 0.94% R0 max in contrast to a range of 1.30–2.49% R0 max for a comparable section on the NE upright limb. This variation occurs over a distance of about 3 km. Multiple intersections of Kootenay strata in oil wells at the south end of the area show low reflectances (0.76% Ro max) at depths of about 3800 m with no change in the shallower Kootenay repeats, whereas wells farther north show higher reflectances and increase with depth. Different burial depths, the influence of thick thrust plates, different paleogeothermal gradients and ground-water movements, all likely have played a part in generating these coalification patterns. A significant part of the coalification in the Kootenay Group appears to have been postdeformational. The rank of the coals in the various subbasins of the Maritimes Basin is nearly all bituminous. Evidence indicates that most of the coalification is postdeformational. Rank within a given coal bed generally increases with increase in depth of present-day burial and the pattern seems to be generally true for most of the coal fields studied. The average postdeformational component of total coalification has been calculated to be 72%. The most important coal field in the Maritimes Basin is the Sydney coal field. Here ranks have been shown to increase from NW to SE and from SW to NE, the latter direction following the downdip structure of the field. Coalification gradients for the Sydney field range from 0.052 to 0.088 R0 max/100 m, reflecting different paleogeothermal gradients.

"soil anomaly mapping using a caesium magnetometer: limits in the low magnetic amplitude case","2006","Caesium magnetometers are new tools for soil property mapping with a decimetric resolution [Mathé, V., Lévêque, F., 2003. High resolution magnetic survey for soil monitoring: detection of drainage and soil tillage effects. Earth and Planetary Science Letters 212 (1–2), 241–251]. However, when the magnetic anomalies are only a few nanoteslas (nT), the geologic and pedogenic signal must first be isolated from magnetic disturbances for this method to be useful. This paper investigates the instrumental artifacts and environmental disturbances to adapt the survey protocol to slightly magnetic soils. Among the possible instrumental sources of disturbances listed and quantified, the most significant are: 1) The battery effect upon sensors 2 m away (classic protocol, about ±0.15 nT) while increasing this distance up to 10 m cancelled it; 2) The noise level of magnetometers and sensors, which, according to tests on two magnetometers and three sensors, rarely and randomly exceeds 0.1 nT, but seems to increase with the electronic component age. Among the environmental disturbances, temporal variations such as diurnal variation or fluctuations linked to the moving of metallic masses play a major role, although the pseudogradient or base-station methods have commonly cancelled them. The efficiency of the latter is strongly dependent on the source nature. However, the ground currents and electromagnetic fields propagating in soils cause more problems. As a first step to better understand such disturbance sources, uncommon magnetic signal variations supposedly due to electromagnetic wave conversions and likely linked to the railway traffic are presented. Based on previous results, an adapted protocol using one magnetometer and two caesium sensors (0.3 and 1.6 m above the surface) is proposed to increase the signal/noise ratio. At first, to maintain an accurate horizontal and vertical location of the sensors, the latter are affixed to a wooden handcart running on plastic rails. Rails adapt to micro-topography, thereby decreasing strongly the soil–sensors distance variations. Anomalies due to topography rarely exceed 0.1 nT. Finally, a method to remove diurnal variations from high-resolution magnetic maps is proposed. Parallel profiles performed successively are adjusted by a cross-profile. Assuming that the temporal variations during each profile are negligible (less than 0.05 nT), this technique, contrary to the pseudogradient, preserves both the decimetric and the metric anomalies (gain of more than 1 nT).","Marshland soils,Survey protocol,Caesium magnetometer,High-resolution magnetic survey,Seismomagnetic wave conversions,"
"insights into deglaciation of the largest ice-free area in the south shetland islands (antarctica) from quantitative analysis of the drainage system","2014","A quantitative geomorphic analysis of the drainage system on Byers Peninsula, Livingston Island, has been carried out in order to study the relief evolution, glacial history and possible neotectonic influence on the largest ice-free area of the South Shetlands archipelago. Aerial photographs, SAR data from RADARSAT-2 satellite, field work, a digital elevation model and GIS spatial analysis have been used to identify, map and study the existing drainage basins. A series of morphometric parameters have been studied in 30 selected basins in order to characterize their shape as well as the drainage network. Results in morphometric parameters reveal elongation trends in the shape of basins and a limited hierarchical network, common of a youthful stage of landscape evolution models. Several morphometric indexes (hypsometric integral, hypsometric curves, SL index, transverse topographical drainage basin asymmetry-T-Factor) have been used to study possible controls on drainage development. Results have been discussed in relation to relief and drainage evolution linked to the spatial distribution of lithological units and structural framework. T-Factor shows an apparently disorganized pattern and absence of tectonic influence. However, there are local values of second order basin asymmetry directions and magnitudes, which could reflect a succession of master rills through time, related to the changes in water supply during the deglaciation history of Byers Peninsula. Hypsometric values and curves of basins are also mainly related to a young stage of landscape evolution. Analysis of hypsometric integrals together with T-Factor index has allowed us to establish a possible deglaciation model on Byers Peninsula, which successfully explains the results. Areas of different landscape evolution stage are linked in space and support the hypothesis of local glacial centers during the ice cover retreat process. SL index results do not show the same pattern in results, which could be due to differences between incision and lateral shifting ratios. Quantitative geomorphic analysis indicates that during the deglaciation of Byers Peninsula, at least three areas acted as local glacial centers (NW, central and Rotch Dome area). Changes in index results clearly show a different behavior between two areas; distal areas and proximal areas close to the glacial centers. Morphometric indexes have demonstrated their being useful tools to provide information on the glacial history in recently deglaciated Antarctic areas.","Byers Peninsula,Quaternary,Glacial geomorphology,Fluvial,Permafrost,Relief evolution,"
"geology of the d'entrecasteaux-new hebrides arc collision zone: results from a deep submersible survey","1992","During the SUBPSO1 cruise, seven submersible dives were conducted between water depths of 5350 and 900 m over the collision zone between the New Hebrides island arc and the d'Entrecasteaux Zone (DEZ). The DEZ, a topographic high on the Australian plate, encompasses the North d'Entrecasteaux Ridge (NDR) and the Bougainville guyot, both of which collide with the island-are slope. In this report we use diving observations and samples, as well as dredging results, to analyse the geology of the Bougainville guyot and the outer arc slope in the DEZ-arc collision zone, and to decipher the mechanisms of scamount subduction. These data indicate that the Bougainville guyot is a middle Eocene island arc volcano capped with reef limestones that appear to have been deposited during the Late Oligocene to Early Miocene and in Miocene-Pliocene times. This guyot possibly emerged during the Middle and Late Miocene, and started to sink in the New Hebrides trench after the Pliocene. The rocks of the New Hebrides arc slope, in the collision zone, consist primarily of Pliocene-Recent volcaniclastic rocks derived from the arc, and underlying fractured island-arc volcanic basement, possibly of Late Miocene age. However, highly sheared, Upper Oligocene to Lower Miocene nannofossil ooze and chalk are exposed at the toe of the arc slope against the northern flank of the NDR. Based on a comparison with cores collected at DSDP Site 286, the ooze and chalk can be interpreted as sediments accreted from the downgoing plate. East of the Bougainville guyot an antiform that developed in the arc slope as a consequence of the collision reveals a 500-m-thick wedge of strongly tectonized rocks, possibly accreted from the guyot or an already subducted seamount. The wedge that is overlain by less deformed volcaniclastic island-arc rocks and sediments includes imbricated layers of Late Oligocene to Early Miocene reef and micritic limestones. This wedge, which develops against the leading flank of the guyot, tends to smooth its high-drag shape. A comparison between the 500-m-thick wedge of limestones that outcrops southeast of the guyot and the absence of such a wedge over the flat top of the guyot, although the top is overthrust by island-arc rocks and sediments, can be interpreted to suggest that the wedge moves in the subduction zone with the guyot and facilitates its subduction by streamlining.",""
"minimum winter temperature reconstruction from average earlywood vessel area of european oak (quercus robur) in n-poland","2016","Tree-ring-based temperature reconstructions form a substantial part of the international proxy data base used to examine and model global climate variations of the last Millennium. However, most tree-ring-based reconstructions are derived from study sites in the high latitudes or high altitudes, paying very little attention to low elevation sites. Thus, a large gap in the geographical coverage of climate reconstructions from temperate low elevation sites in central Europe still exists. This motivated us to concentrate our efforts on the European oak (Quercus robur) in N-Poland. We developed a new robust tree-ring width chronology (TRW), as well as four wood anatomical chronologies (e.g. average vessel area and number of vessels) from Q. robur for the period 1810 to 2010. The chronologies were examined for their climatological responses. While TRW was found to have weak correlations with climate, the earlywood vessel parameters (EVP), especially average vessel area (AVA), revealed significant positive correlations to minimum winter temperatures. Based on stable climate–growth correlations, a reconstruction of minimum winter temperatures (29th November to 20th January) back to 1810 was performed for north Poland. The reconstruction indicates a promising potential to reveal low-frequency climate information. An additional extreme year analysis suggested that in cold winters, a cold–warm–cold pattern in the minimum temperatures was responsible for the relatively small earlywood vessels. Spatial field correlations imply that our reconstruction is more related to temperature variations towards the east of Europe. The reconstructed temperature compared well with two existing temperature reconstructions, especially during most of the 20th century, even though the temperature reconstructions differ spatially and temporally. Based on these findings, the relatively extensive resource of archeological oak material from this region may be useful to perform multicentennial climate reconstructions in the temperate climate zone.","Temperature reconstruction,Poland,Temperate lowlands,Wood anatomy,Dendroclimatology,Earlywood vessel parameter,"
"chapter 15 - dynamics, assessment, and management of exploited natural scallop populations","2016","This chapter reviews advances made in the study of the structure and dynamics of scallop populations and in the development of new approaches for the assessment and management of exploited scallop stocks. Significant progress in the understanding of larval transport and connectivity of scallop populations has been achieved in recent years through the use of coupled biophysical modelling in combination with novel population genetics techniques. The assessment of abundance and distribution of scallops stocks has benefitted from recent technological developments, particularly in the fields of acoustics and underwater photography. These developments have led to mapping scallop distributions in relation to bottom type characterisations obtained from multi-beam sonar data, groundtruthed using conventional in situ sampling, including underwater imagery. Underwater cameras have also become more common, replacing conventional fishing gears used for periodic monitoring surveys. Management has increasingly focused on spatial harvesting strategies that recognise the existence of spatial gradients in scallop productivity, the non-random allocation of fishing effort and the large inter-annual variability that is typical of scallop recruitment. The use of management strategy evaluation methods to design harvest control rules that are suited to the fishery specific characteristics, and monitoring capabilities is a promising area of new development. Concerns about habitat impacts of dredges and trawls used for harvesting scallops have received much scientific attention as the scope of fisheries assessment has expanded beyond the target species to include broader ecological effects of fishing.","Scallops,scallop stock assessment,scallop fishery management,population dynamics,sessile invertebrates,"
"trial results of a new low-cost and covert technology to trace the path of maritime containers worldwide","2008","There are approximately 7 million maritime style containers within Canada, and 70 million within the USA. The interiors of such containers are rarely inspected. With market globalization, a large amount of these containers enter North America on a daily basis. Such containers may include contraband or dangerous items that present an economic or security risk. Despite significant security improvements, only 3 to 5% of the maritime containers, that arrive in or transition through North America, go through physical inspection. Current container tracking technologies based on GPS consume high DC power, are costly, require line-of-sight with satellites and they are often too large to be covert. It is possible to overcome some of these limitations by basing the tracking system on the FM broadcast signal which is an alternative man-made signal that is reasonably ubiquitous, provides a geographically unique frequency spectrum and is about 100,000 as strong as a GPS satellite signal. This allows the development of a low cost, low power and miniature FM receiver that can record frequency spectrums and compare them to known data in order to trace the path that the container has taken for less than 10$ per container. This paper presents the first results of highway trials (train and sea trials are to be conducted in 2009) of such a low cost, covert, non-GPS based technology (called 'FM Tag') that records the worldwide displacement of containers and displays the path undertaken by the container while in transit. As an added security benefit, the tag is also capable of detecting container door openings. In addition to presenting the first trial results, this paper covers the innovative engineering aspects of using the metal enclosure of a maritime container as a VHF antenna, thereby eliminating the need to add an external antenna and achieving the goal of being 100% covert.","Maritime container traceability,Costs,Inspection,low-cost covert technology,Global Positioning System,FM broadcast signal,ships,Containers,alternative man-made signal,high DC power,Maritime container intrusion sensor and Article traceability,Globalization,market globalization,maritime containers path,GPS,Satellite broadcasting,North America,Frequency,Power generation economics,Security,"

It starts with an overview of the complexity of the acoustic signals resulting from installation and operation of renewable energy systems and the efforts required to measure and interpret those signals. This is followed by a discussion of the United Nations' Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organization's Hydro-acoustic sites in strategic locations in the world's oceans and their expertise in understanding low-frequency acoustic noise and the opportunity for researchers to take advantage of continuous recording that in many cases are more than a decade of time. The Characterization of Noise from Ships is both a classic and a modern view of the features of radiated energy from naval vessels. Underwater Soundscapes is a new look at understanding and interpreting noise fields. It is an especially valuable methodology for separating the myriad of oceanic noise sources. Underwater Acoustic Communications provides an introduction to the issues in that field. Underwater Archaeology is an introduction to a fascinating science that benefits greatly from the ability of high-frequency acoustic energy to image in a competitive way with visual means, but over useful ranges, the artifacts of our forebears. Applications of Underwater Acoustics in Polar Environments is very timely, given the renewed interest in these regions due to accessibility caused by global warming.

"modeling and simulation in support of understanding maritime security and defense capabilities and requirements (the maritime timeline and analysis requirements toolset (m-tart))","2011","Those responsible for the Maritime Security of North America face a daunting task. The breadth of activities in the maritime domain makes it very difficult to achieve an acceptable level of understanding and control. This leaves decision makers to deal with a multi-national challenge that is very much connected to the aerospace, land and cyberspace domains. In order for the decision makers responsible for the Maritime Security and Defense of North America to effectively execute their missions, they require both an understanding of their current capabilities and gaps, and a means to determine the capability requirements to close any identified gaps. This paper presents the Maritime Timeline Analysis and Requirements Toolset (M-TART) as a modeling and simulation solution to address this problem.

"a method for maritime target tracking based on kernelized spectral filter","2022","Maritime target tracking can be applied in the fields of intelligent marine transportation and resource protection. The spectral filter tracking method focuses on the adaptability of the local appearance changes of targets, with the graph representation. Considering the complexity and diversity of the marine environment, we propose a maritime target tracking algorithm based on kernelized spectral filter. The spectral filtering is modeled as a tracking framework based on kernel regression. According to graph signal processing and spectral graph theory, based on the description of kernel regression on graph signals, we deduce and discuss the construction of the filter, the calculation of kernel matrix, the solution of kernel regression model, and the prediction of tracking position. With the help of a nonlinear model, it can effectively improve the precision under complex tracking conditions. The experimental results on the benchmark dataset verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, especially when the target tracking is affected by waves or wakes.","graph representation,graph signal processing,matrix algebra,Feature extraction,intelligent transportation systems,kernel regression,Predictive models,regression analysis,kernel matrix,Filtering algorithms,Filtering,target tracking,position tracking,Target tracking,spectral filter tracking method,particle filtering (numerical methods),kernelized spectral filter,Signal processing,graph theory,kernel regression model,spectral graph theory,resource protection,spectral filtering,Signal processing algorithms,maritime target tracking,intelligent marine transportation,"

"satellite-derived bathymetry for maritime archaeology: testing its effectiveness at two ancient harbours in the eastern mediterranean","2021","High-resolution bathymetry is an essential tool in maritime archaeology, often used for underwater prospection, imaging, palaeo-landscape reconstruction and change detection. The commonest acquisition method relies on shipborne acoustic systems (e.g. multibeam echosounder). However, most of the world’s seabed has not been surveyed using these methods. Derivation of bathymetry from high-resolution multispectral satellite imagery (Satellite-Derived Bathymetry: SDB) can redress this in shallow (<20–30 m depth) clear water. It can be derived empirically using depth control points, or independent of control data through physics-based approaches. Given global satellite coverage, it is applicable almost anywhere with suitable water conditions and is becoming increasingly widespread in the hydrographic survey community. However, archaeological application of SDB is almost totally un-investigated. This paper examines the utility of SDB for maritime archaeology through 2 case studies: the ancient harbours of Tyre (Lebanon) and Ras Ibn Hani (Syria). Tested data comprise 2 m-resolution physics-based commercial SDB and medium-resolution (10–30 m) SDB empirically derived from open access multispectral imagery (Landsat 8, Sentinel-2). SDB was assessed for its ability to detect submerged cultural features and landforms and as input into palaeo-geographic reconstructions. Tested SDB performed poorly for feature detection, but was better-suited to landform identification and palaeo-geographic reconstruction. SDB also has clear advantages: low cost, wide area coverage, speed and data availability. Disadvantages include variable accuracy, technical limitations (e.g. need for clear water) and approach-specific requirements (e.g. depth control points for empirical and complex modelling for physics-based approaches). For maritime archaeology, its current limitations means that it will not replace acoustics for prospection and imaging but it does have utility for submerged landscape investigation and reconstruction, particularly in areas which now only have no/poor bathymetric data.","Bathymetry,SDB,Submerged landscapes,Geoarchaeology,Shipwrecks,Satellite imagery,"
"the 79 ce eruption of vesuvius: a lesson from the past and the need of a multidisciplinary approach for developments in volcanology","2022","A full review of the 79 CE Plinian eruption of Vesuvius is presented through a multidisciplinary approach, exploiting the integration of historical, stratigraphic, sedimentological, petrological, geophysical, paleoclimatic, and modelling studies dedicated to this famous and devastating natural event. All studies have critically been reviewed and integrated with original data, spanning from proximal to ultradistal findings of the 79 CE eruption products throughout the Mediterranean. The work not only combines different investigation approaches (stratigraphic, petrological, geophysical, modelling), but also follows temporally the 79 CE eruptive and depositional events, from the magma chamber to the most distal tephras. This has allowed us first to compile a full database of all findings of those deposits, then to relate the products (the deposits) to the genetic thermomechanical processes (the eruption), and lastly to better assess both the local and regional impacts of the 79 CE eruption in the environment. This information leads to a number of open issues (e.g., regional environmental impact vs. local pyroclastic current impact) that are worthy of further investigations, although the 79 CE eruption of Vesuvius is one of the best studied eruptions in volcanology. The structure of the work follows three macro-categories, the historical aspects, the products, and the processes of the 79 CE eruption. For each investigation approach (from stratigraphy to modelling), all dedicated studies and original data are discussed. The open issues are then synthesized in the discussion under a global view of Plinian eruptions, from the magma setting to its dispersion as pyroclasts flowing on the surface vs. falling from the volcanic plume. In this way, a lesson from the past, in particular from the well-studied 79 CE eruption of Vesuvius, will be of help for a better synchronization of processes and products in future developments. Lastly, various aspects for volcanic hazard assessment of Plinian eruptions are highlighted from the tephra distribution and modelling points of view, as these large natural phenomena can have a larger impact than previously thought, also at other active volcanoes.","Vesuvius,Pyroclastic currents,Pompeii,Plinian eruption,79 CE eruption,Multidisciplinary approach,Pyroclastic succession,79 CE tephra dispersal,"

Sentinel-3 is an Earth observation satellite mission specifically designed for GMES to ensure the long-term collection and operational delivery of high-quality measurements to GMES ocean, land, and atmospheric services, while contributing to the GMES, emergency and security services. Key Sentinel-3 measurement requirements, corresponding to identified GMES user needs, have been derived as follows:•Sea surface topography (SSH), significant wave height (Hs) and surface wind speed derived over the global ocean to an equivalent accuracy and precision as that presently achieved by ENVISAT Radar Altimeter-2 (RA-2) but with enhanced surface topography measurements in the coastal zone, sea ice regions and over inland rivers, their tributaries and lakes.•Sea surface temperature (SST) determined for oceanic and coastal waters globally to an equivalent accuracy and precision as that presently achieved by the ENVISAT Advanced Along Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR) over the ocean (i.e. <0.3K), at a spatial resolution of 1km.•Visible, and Short-Wave Infrared radiances for oceanic, inland and coastal waters at a spatial resolution of 0.3km (simultaneously and co-registered with SST measurements), determined to an equivalent level of accuracy and precision as ENVISAT Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer with complete ocean coverage in 2–3days.•Visible and infrared radiances over global land-surfaces in 1–2days, sea-ice and ice-sheets equivalent to those currently provided from ENVISAT MERIS, AATSR and Système Probatoire d'Observation de la Terre (SPOT) Vegetation. The Sentinel-3 mission addresses these requirements by implementing and operating:•A dual frequency, Synthetic Aperture Radar Altimeter (SRAL) instrument supported by a dual frequency passive microwave radiometer (MWR) for wet-tropospheric correction, a Precise Orbit Determination package including a GPS receiver, a DORIS instrument and a laser retro-reflector.•A highly sensitive Ocean and Land Colour Imager (OLCI) delivering multi-channel wide-swath optical measurements for ocean and land surfaces.•A dual-view Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR) delivering accurate surface ocean, land, and ice temperature.•A collaborative ground segment providing management of the mission, management, development, production and access to core data products in an operational near real time delivery context.

In this region of heavy interdependent use, the Gulf of Mexico cradles many of the environmental and economic interactions for the continental United States. It provides sanctuary to countless biological species, contains energy resources and allows efficient transportation of economic goods and cargo. Any disruption to this area would be catastrophic, with complicated and far-reaching effects. Currently, the resources that provide monitoring and allow intervention are provided by multi agency organizations and are finite and limited. It is proposed that addition of a fiber optic network system will augment and complement these resources allowing real time data capture and expanded risk management decision making capability. Well placed within the geographic region of the Gulf is an already installed fiber optic system called FiberWeb. It encircles the heart of the oil and gas production in the Gulf of Mexico, running from the tip of Louisiana to the Texas coast, along the continental shelf, with an intended purpose of providing secure, reliable and expendable communications link between offshore production facilities and onshore bases.

"a safety barrier-based accident model for offshore drilling blowouts","2013","Blowout is one of the most serious accidents in the offshore oil and gas industry. Accident records show that most of the offshore blowouts have occurred in the drilling phase. Efficient measures to prevent, mitigate, and control offshore drilling blowouts are important for the entire offshore oil and gas industry. This article proposes a new barrier-based accident model for drilling blowouts. The model is based on the three-level well control theory, and primary and secondary well control barriers and an extra well monitoring barrier are established between the reservoir and the blowout event. The three barriers are illustrated in a graphical model that is similar to the well-known Swiss cheese model. Five additional barriers are established to mitigate and control the blowout accident, and event tree analysis is used to analyze the possible consequence chains. Based on statistical data and literature reviews, failures of each barrier are presented. These failures can be used as guidance for offshore drilling operators to become aware of the vulnerabilities of the safety barrier system, and to assess the risk related to these barriers. The Macondo accident is used as a case study to show how the new model can be used to understand the development of the events leading to the accident. The model can also be used as an aid to prevent future blowouts or to stop the escalation of events.","Accident model,Offshore drilling,Active failures,Safety barrier,Blowout,"

So far, little is known about past shifts of these climate boundaries and the local to regional environmental response prior to the instrumental era. High resolution multi-proxy data (stable oxygen and carbon isotope ratios, S/Ca and Sr/Ca) from two Holocene stalagmites from Bleßberg Cave (Thuringia) are used here to differentiate local and pan-regional environmental and climatic conditions Central Germany through the Holocene. Carbon isotope and S/Ca and Sr/Ca ratios inform us on local Holocene environmental changes in and around the cave, while δ18O (when combined with independent records) serves as proxy for (pan-)regional atmospheric conditions. The stable carbon isotope record suggests repeated changes in vegetation density (open vs. dense forest), and increasing forest cover in the late Holocene. Concurrently, decreasing S/Ca values indicate more effective sulfur retention in better developed soils, with a stabilization in the mid-Holocene. This goes in hand with changes in effective summer infiltration, reflected in the Sr/Ca profile. Highest Sr/Ca values between 4 ka and 1 ka BP indicate intensified prior calcite precipitation resulting from reduced effective moisture supply. The region of Bleßberg Cave is sensitive to shifts of the boundary between maritime (Cfb) and continental (Dfb) climate and ideally suited to reconstruct past meridional shifts of this divide. We combined the Bleßberg Cave δ18O time series with δ18O data from Bunker Cave (western Germany) and a North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) record from lake SS1220 (SW Greenland) to reconstruct the mean position of the Cfb-Dfb climate boundary. We further estimate the dynamic interplay of the North Atlantic Oscillation and the Siberian High and their influence on Central European climate. Repeated shifts of the Cfb-Dfb boundary over the last 4000 years might explain previously observed discrepancies between proxy records from Europe. Detailed correlation analyses reveal multi-centennial scale alternations of maritime and continental climate and, concurrently, waning and waxing influences of Siberian High and NAO on Central Europe.","S/Ca,Speleothem,Climate boundary,Sr/Ca,Oxygen isotopes,Palaeoclimate,Germany,Continental climate,Carbon isotopes,Holocene,Maritime climate,"
"diapycnal diffusivity in the core and oxycline of the tropical north atlantic oxygen minimum zone","2016","Diapycnal diffusivity estimates from two Tracer Release Experiments (TREs) and microstructure measurements in the oxycline and core of the oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) in the Eastern Tropical North Atlantic (ETNA) are compared. For the first time, two TREs within the same area at different depths were realized: the Guinea Upwelling Tracer Release Experiment (GUTRE) initiated in 2008 in the oxycline at approximately 320m depth, and the Oxygen Supply Tracer Release Experiment (OSTRE) initiated in 2012 in the core of the OMZ at approximately 410m depth. The mean diapycnal diffusivity Dz was found to be insignificantly smaller in the OMZ core with (1.06±0.24)×10−5m2s−1 compared to (1.11±0.22)×10−5m2s−1 90m shallower in the oxycline. Unexpectedly, GUTRE tracer was detected during two of the OSTRE surveys which showed that the estimated diapycnal diffusivity from GUTRE over a time period of seven years was within the uncertainty of the previous estimates over a time period of three years. The results are consistent with the Dz estimates from microstructure measurements and demonstrate that Dz does not vary significantly vertically in the OMZ within the depth range of 200–600m and does not change with time. The presence of a seamount chain in the vicinity of the GUTRE injection region did not cause enhanced Dz compared to the smoother bottom topography of the OSTRE injection region, although the analysis of vertical shear spectra from ship ADCP data showed elevated internal wave energy level in the seamount vicinity. However, the two tracer patches covered increasingly overlapping areas with time and thus spatially integrated increasingly similar fields of local diffusivity, as well as the difference in local stratification counteracted the influence of roughness on Dz. For both experiments no significant vertical displacements of the tracer were observed, thus diapycnal upwelling within the ETNA OMZ is below the uncertainty level of 5myr−1.","Tropical Atlantic,Guinea Dome,Tracers,Diffusion coefficients,Upwelling,Oxygen minimum zone,Ventilation,"
"graph-based ship traffic partitioning for intelligent maritime surveillance in complex port waters","2023","Maritime Situational Awareness (MSA) is a critical component of intelligent maritime traffic surveillance. However, it becomes increasingly challenging to gain MSA accurately given the growing complexity of ship traffic patterns due to multi-ship interactions possibly involving classical manned ships and emerging autonomous ships. This study proposes a new traffic partitioning methodology to realise the optimal maritime traffic partition in complex waters. The methodology combines conflict criticality and spatial distance to generate conflict-connected and spatially compact traffic clusters, thereby improving the interpretability of traffic patterns and supporting ship anti-collision risk management. First, a composite similarity measure is designed using a probabilistic conflict detection approach and a newly formulated maritime traffic route network learned through maritime knowledge mining. Then, an extended graph-based clustering framework is used to produce balanced traffic clusters with high intra-connections but low inter-connections. The proposed methodology is thoroughly demonstrated and tested using Automatic Identification System (AIS) trajectory data in the Ningbo-Zhoushan Port. The experimental results show that the proposed methodology 1) has effective performance in decomposing the traffic complexity, 2) can assist in identifying high-risk/density traffic clusters, and 3) is sufficiently generic to handle various traffic scenarios in complex geographical waters. Therefore, this study makes significant contributions to intelligent maritime surveillance and provides a theoretical foundation for promoting maritime anti-collision risk management for the future mixed traffic of both manned and autonomous ships.","Graph partitioning,Intelligent maritime surveillance,Maritime safety,Maritime knowledge extraction,AIS data,"
"climatic variability in humid africa along the gulf of guinea part i: detailed analysis of the phenomenon in côte d'ivoire","1997","The analysis presented here deals with annual precipitation as well as the number of rainy days observed in Côte d'Ivoire during the decades from 1950 to 1980. The study is based on a set of methods both for interpolation and for cartographic representation as well as on statistical methods for the detection of breaks in the time series. The methods reveal a climatic variability in the country as a whole at the end of the 60s and at the beginning of the 70s. Indeed, the results show that there was a sharp decrease both in rainfall amounts and in the number of rainy days during the 60s and the 70s. Côte d'Ivoire, which belongs to humid Africa, was therefore affected by a climatic accident comparable to and in line with what was observed further north in the Sahelian region.",""
"harmful algal bloom forecast system for sw ireland. part ii: are operational oceanographic models useful in a hab warning system","2016","This study investigated the application of a three-dimensional physical hydrodynamic model in a harmful algal bloom forecast system for Bantry Bay, southwest Ireland. Modelled oceanographic conditions were studied and used to help understand observed changes in the chemical and biological patterns from the national biotoxins and phytoplankton monitoring program. The study focused on two toxic events in 2013. An upwelling event was predicted by the model prior to the appearance and population increase of potentially toxic diatoms, Pseudo-nitzschia, and associated domoic acid in shellfish. A downwelling episode was provided as a forecast in the model prior to the arrival of a Dinophysis bloom and detection of its associated biotoxins in Bay shellfish. The modelled forecast products developed included expected surface, mid-depth and bottom current pathways at the mouth of the Bay and on the adjacent shelf. The rate and direction of water volume flow at the mouth and mid-bay sections were produced by the model to examine predicted upwelling and downwelling pulses. The model also calculated the evolution of water properties (temperature, salinity and density) with depth along the Bay axis and on the adjacent continental shelf. Direct measurements of water properties at a fixed point, mid-bay, were comparable to model calculations. The operational model for southwest Ireland produces a reliable 3-day physical hydrodynamic forecast of the dominant regional physical processes that result in water exchange events between Bantry Bay and its adjacent shelf. While simulated physical hydrodynamics were provided as a 3-day forecast, the upwelling and downwelling signals from the model, closely linked to toxic HAB episodes, were evident up to 10 days prior to the contamination of shellfish in the Bay.","Modelled products,Ireland,Nowcast/forecast,HAB,"
"a methodology to improve the assessment of vulnerability on the maritime supply chain of energy","2015","The globalization of trade is due to the transportation possibilities and the standardization (containerization of freight). The dependency of the economy to the sea and to the merchant navy has increase this last decade. This process forms a worldwide maritime network between the different locations of production and consumption. This network, representing between 80 % and 90% of world traffic is a major economic concern, including freight distribution, raw materials or energy. Rodrigue demonstrates[1] the economic dependency of energy is increasing in the industrialized countries (North America, Europe, East Asia). The inter-regional trade of oil was 31 million bbl/day in 2002 and is expected to grow up to 57 bbl/day in 2030 [2]. Most of the international traffic use a maritime way, where may occur disruptions. For example, the Suez crisis (1956-1957) caused a closure of the canal, reducing the throughput capacity of transportation. This disruption cost a 2 millions of barrels lost per day.

"a geospatial hub to support wind energy and maritime activity spaces near hampton roads, virginia, u.s.a.","2022","The urgent need for clean, sustainable energy development prompts the Commonwealth of Virginia (U.S.A.) to support the development of wind energy in state and federal waters. The port of Hampton Roads is a vital region for maritime commerce, recreation, and national defense, and the state also aims to avert wind development impacts on national security. This project assessed the state of marine geodata portals and decisionsupport methods for wind energy siting and developed a solution to inform energy developers, military stakeholders, and state and local government. An interdisciplinary team developed a user experience (UX) design approach to the problem, gathering persona-driven requirements and designing, prototyping, and testing a solution. Extensive geospatial wind resource data, energy infrastructure, shore and maritime air and vessel activity, protected lands, energy grid connections, and administrative processes are integrated in a web-based solution to screen and assess compatibility. This paper highlights Geographic Information Systems (GIS) used to provide decision support for site suitability analysis of offshore wind energy potential. With a focus on military use spaces, the project sought to gather publicly available activity spaces and areas of critical concern to military siting. We also integrated the newest available maritime vessel traffic activity from AIS data. A user-driven design is applied with GIS data that incorporates the diverse variability of energy, jurisdictional, and potential activity use space conflicts of an increasingly busy maritime environment. The approach taken in this project demonstrates that UX can support the range of developers, regulators, and maritime space users. The WindsiteVA hub spans onshore as well as offshore and nearshore (state waters and the Chesapeake Bay). Spatial analyses include several webmap capabilities, a library of basemaps, site exploration and coordinate conversion tools, reporting tools, and metadata and external data resources. Users are guided through pathways unique to personas: Developers, government agency personnel, or military personnel. As a â€œone-stop toolâ€ the webbased site is accessible publicly and utilizes Esri ArcGIS Hub technology. The site steps users through critical processes and data elements, such as informal queries, Notice of Proposed Construction for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), VA Department of Environmental Quality Permit by Rule (PBR), the US Department of Defense siting clearinghouse, and other procedures. Results suggest improved spatial decision-making and marine spatial planning can be achieved at minimal cost by combining UX design and geospatial hub technology. Wind resource development around seaports can be optimized and spatial conflicts reduced, costs lowered, and cumulative impacts identified. WindSiteVA captures complex processes and major concerns for wind energy availability and military concerns, yet it is not redundant with other policies or rules nor does it reflect sitescale reviews such as environmental impact assessments. Early results of WindSiteVA show that a screening-level approach can assist wind energy developers in coastal inshore and offshore waters, where relatively abundant wind energy resources exist, and reduce impacts to military and national defense and other maritime activities.","decision support systems,maritime vessel traffic activity,maritime commerce,wind energy availability,user experience design,vessel activity,web-based solution,government agency personnel,WindSiteVA captures complex process,Costs,maritime space users,Geospatial analysis,administrative process,wind energy siting,maritime activity spaces,UX design,extensive geospatial wind resource data,wind energy developers,webbased site,maritime air,military concerns,offshore waters,Hampton Roads,Esri ArcGIS Hub technology,local government,wind development impacts,persona-driven requirements,Virginia,clean energy development,wind energy resources,maritime activity space,military stakeholders,environmental impact assessments,Seaports,offshore wind energy potential,sustainable energy development,military personnel,Wind energy,Wind,busy maritime environment,external data resources,military siting,site suitability analysis,user-driven design,offshore installations,geographic information systems,wind power,publicly available activity spaces,military use spaces,national defense,US Department of Defense,Roads,Federal Aviation Administration,offshore wind,GIS data,geospatial hub,geographic information system,national security,energy grid connections,federal waters,wind resource development,WindsiteVA hub,energy infrastructure,maritime activities,site suitability,marine geodata portals,informal queries,AIS data,screening-level approach,FAA,"
"anomaly detection in maritime domain based on spatio-temporal analysis of ais data using graph neural networks","2021","One of the critical applications of trajectory mining is Event Detection, where an automatized task identifies the deviation of a vesselâ€™s movement from its standard route. Conventionally, Origin-Destination matrix data is utilized for event detection which has limitations such as removal of temporal aspect of data and inability to access to trajectory features such as speed of vessel from origin to destination. To utilize aforementioned features available in Automatic information system (AIS), we formulate the problem in a novel way, by detecting anomalies in a set of directed graphs representing the movement pattern at each time interval. We further propose Graph Network Deviation Detector (GNDD), which leverages graph embedding and context embedding techniques to capture anomalies in the spatio-temporal patterns of movement. Extensive experiments applied on five real-world AIS datasets show that our method achieved promising results in identifying abnormal movements.","Graph neural networks,critical applications,data mining,graph embedding,event detection,Automatic information system,Anomaly detection,matrix algebra,Graph Network Deviation Detector,abnormal movements,Origin-Destination matrix data,Feature extraction,movement pattern,neural nets,Directed graphs,temporal aspect,marine systems,automatized task,Signal processing,maritime domain,directed graphs,Artificial intelligence,trajectory mining,standard route,graph theory,anomaly Detection,Spatiotemporal graph embeddings,real-world AIS datasets,spatio-temporal analysis,Trajectory,trajectory features,aforementioned features,Event detection,AIS data,"
"monitoring the algerian basin through glider observations, satellite altimetry and numerical simulations along a saral/altika track","2018","The Algerian Basin is a key component of the general circulation in the Western Mediterranean Sea. The presence of both fresh Atlantic water and more saline Mediterranean water gives the basin an intense inflow/outflow regime and complex circulation patterns. Energetic mesoscale structures that evolve from meanders of the Algerian Current into isolated cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies dominate the area, with marked repercussions on biological activity. Despite its remarkable importance, this region and its variability are still poorly known and basin-wide knowledge of its meso- and submesoscale features is still incomplete. Studying such complex processes requires a synergistic approach that involves integrated observing systems. In recent years, several studies have demonstrated the advantages of combined use of autonomous underwater vehicles, such as gliders, with a new generation of satellite altimetry. In this context, we present results of an observational program conducted in the Algerian Basin during fall 2014 and 2015 that aimed to advance our knowledge of its main features. The study was carried out through analysis of high resolution glider observations, collected along the Algerian BAsin Circulation Unmanned Survey (ABACUS) chokepoint, in synergy with co-located SARAL/AltiKa altimetric products and CMEMS numerical simulations. Results show that glider-derived dynamic height and SARAL/AltiKa absolute dynamic topography have similar patterns, with RMS of the differences ranging between 1.11 and 2.90 cm. Even though larger discrepancies are observed near the Balearic and Algerian coasts, correlation coefficients between glider and satellite observations seem mostly to be affected by reduced synopticity between the measurements. Glider observations acquired during the four surveys reveal the presence of several water masses of Atlantic and Mediterranean origin (i.e., AW and LIW at different modification levels) with marked seasonal variability.","Algerian Basin,CMEMS models,Satellite altimetry,Glider observations,SARAL-AltiKa along track data,"
"halophyte die-off in response to anthropogenic impacts on tidal flats","2014","This study analyzed an abrupt change in halophyte populations, especially the annual plant Suaeda japonica. The boundaries and distributions of S. japonica and Phragmites australis were determined based on the decision tree classifier of TerraSAR-X, SAVI of Landsat ETM+, and density slicing of aerial photography. A large patch of S. japonica in the eastern parts of Donggum-do, South Korea, disappeared in 2007, while populations have been stable in the western parts of the island. To understand the reason behind the sudden die-off, mean sea level was analyzed based on gaged tidal data. Sedimentation rate was measured using Vernier caliper and RTK leveling data. Sedimentation rate between 2006 and 2007 was above the threshold at which S. japonica can germinate. After the loss of an 11-ha S. japonica patch from the eastern part of Donggum-do, sedimentation was accelerated because of a decrease in tidal current caused by a series of land reclamation projects. The increased monthly exposure duration due to continuous sediment accretion altered the type of salt marsh. Our results imply that accumulated effects from a series of coastal construction projects around Ganghwa-do can change not only tide and current hydrodynamics, but also sedimentation and erosion rates, which can cause large halophyte patches to disappear.","halophyte,sedimentation,tidal flat,salt marsh,"

"the southeast asian tin belt","1995","The Southeast Asian Tin Belt is a north-south elongate zone 2800 km long and 400 km wide, extending from Burma (Myanmar) and Thailand to Peninsular Malaysia and the Indonesian Tin Islands. Altogether 9.6 million tonnes of tin, equivalent to 54% of the world's tin production is derived from this region. Most of the granitoids in the region can be grouped geographically into elongate provinces or belts, based on petrographic and geochronological features. - The Main Range Granitoid Province in western Peninsular Malaysia, southern Peninsular Thailand and central Thailand is almost entirely made up of biotite granite (184–230 Ma). Tin deposits associated with these granites contributed 55% of the historic tin production of Southeast Asia. - The Northern Granitoid Province in northern Thailand (0.1% of tin production) also has dominant biotite granite (200–269 Ma) but it is distinguished by abundant post-intrusion deformation. - The Eastern Granitoid Province extends from eastern Peninsular Malaysia to eastern Thailand. The Malaysian part is subdivided into the East Coast Belt (220–263 Ma), Boundary Range Belt (197–257 Ma) and Central Belt (79–219 Ma). The granitoids cover a wide compositional range from biotite granite to hornblende-biotite granite/granodiorite and diorite-gabbro. Tin deposits are associated with biotite granite in the East Coast Belt (3% of tin production). The granitoids in the other areas of the Eastern Granitoid Province are barren. - The Western Granitoid Province (22–149 Ma) in northern Peninsular Thailand, western Thailand and Burma has biotite granite and hornblende-biotite granite/granodiorite. Tin deposits are associated with biotite granite, which probably is the dominant phase (14% of tin production). The granitoids of the Indonesian Tin Islands (193–251 Ma) do not permit grouping into geographically distinct units. Main Range-type and Eastern Province-type plutons occur next to each other. Most of the tin deposits are associated with Main Range-type plutons (28% of tin production). Tin-mineralized plutons are characterized by high concentrations of SiO2, K2O, Rb, Sn, Th and U, whereas the concentrations of Fe2O3, MgO, CaO, Na2O, Ba and Sr as well as the Fe2O3FeO ratios are low.

Outlier detection strategy is used to efficiently explore the road network and remove irrelevant patterns and noise. The resulting graph is then implemented to train an extended graph convolutional neural network to estimate the traffic flow in the city. To accurately tune the hyperparameter values of the proposed framework, a new optimization technique is developed based on branch and bound.

"global change and the measurement of absolute sea-level","1987","To quantify properly the long-term response of sea-level to climate change, land motions must be separated from the apparent or relative sea-level change recorded by conventional tide/sea-level gauges. Here we present a concept for global measurement of the true or “absolute” sea-level change, which combines recent advances in space-based geodetic techniques with plans for a global sea-level network under the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP). Data from initial feasibility tests show that land motion, due to global (plate tectonic), regional (glacial rebound), or local (fluid withdrawal) effects, can probably be measured to ±1cm (on a single measurement basis) by an innovative combination of Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) and Global Positioning System (GPS) tevhniques. By making repeated observations of position at a number of tide gauges using portable, economical GPS receivers in a differential mode relative to the fewer, more stable, but more expensive VLBI observatories, it will be possible to subtract land motion from the relative sea-level signal. Decadal to century scale trends at the 1–2mm y−1 level will be resolvable in the sea-level and vertical land motion time series within about a decade. Detection of subsidence or uplift at specific gauges will allow correction for land motion or deletion of bad data when computing regional or global, i.e. eustatic, sea-level changes. In addition to their applications in oceanography and climate studies, such data will test models by Peltier and other that relate mantle viscosity and deglaciation history to present rates of crustal subsidence or uplift. If the predicted crustal motions are confirmed, we can also have more confidence in the use of historical tide/sea-level gauge records in retrospective studies of sea-level change related to climate variability on decadal or longer time scales. It is concluded that as few as one-third (about 100) of the total number of tide/sea-level gauges (250–300) required for global climate research programmes (WYRTKI and PUGH, 1984) need to be upgraded to “sea-level observatory” status, in terms of sensors and geodetic control, to build a two tier sea-level network that will provide the data needed to solve many problems of both relative and absolute sea-level change. Such a network will provide basic information supporting research on a wide range of questions related to “global change”.",""

"fires and rates of change in the temperate rainforests of northwestern patagonia since ∼18 ka","2023","We examine the temporal and spatial structure of wildfires and rates of vegetation change in the Pacific sector of northwestern Patagonia (40°-44°S) over the last ∼18,000 years. Macroscopic Charcoal Accumulation Rates (CHAR), a proxy of past local fires, shows a geographic variation that mirrors the modern north-to-south and low-to-high elevation increase in annual precipitation and decrease in precipitation seasonality, and the frequency of explosive volcanic events. Variability in past fires is evident at multiple timescales, with a significant multi-millennial low between ∼18–13.1 ka, an abrupt rise between ∼13.1–12.5 ka, and heightened fire activity between ∼11.4–8.2 ka with significant high values between ∼10–9.4 ka. A subsequent decline led to the lowest Holocene values between ∼6–5.4 ka, which rose and led to significant high values between ∼3.1 ka and the present. Andean and Western Upwind Environments share a multi-millennial structure of fire activity since ∼18 ka, overprinted by millennial and centennial-scale divergences. These differences underscore the role of explosive volcanism as a trigger or modulator of fire activity in the vicinity of Andean eruptive centers. We posit that fire activity in Western Upwind Environments was driven primarily by hydroclimate variations, namely changes in the intensity of the Southern Westerly Winds. Compilations of CHAR and the Rates of Change (ROC) parameter, a measure of the magnitude and rapidity of changes in the pollen records, covary during the onset of the interglacial fire regime at ∼13.1 ka and the last ∼4000 years, suggesting that fires catalyzed vegetation changes during specific intervals since the last glaciation. Highly mobile human occupations deployed along the coasts started at ∼6.2 ka, increased in pulses, and spread widely during the last two millennia. Covariation with CHAR and ROC since ∼4 ka suggests that hunter-gatherer-fishers contributed to enhanced fire activity and abrupt vegetation changes at regional scale. The ubiquitous fire maximum over the last four centuries relates to widespread settlement and associated large-scale land clearance conducted by European/Chilean settlers.","Human occupations,Explosive volcanism,Southern westerly winds,Rates of vegetation change,Northwestern Patagonia,Temperate rainforests,Chilean/European settlers,Macroscopic Charcoal Accumulation Rates,"

Associated limb and orofacial anomalies were observed in six cases. Computed tomographic scans were available in six children, and five of them manifested brainstem calcification which was most prominent in the floor of the fourth ventricle. The calcification was detected as early as 7 days of age and did not change with time, suggesting a static condition of prenatal onset. These observations support the hypothesis that the pathology in Möbius syndrome is secondary to prenatal brain ischemia.",""
"regional scale assessment of submarine groundwater discharge in ireland combining medium resolution satellite imagery and geochemical tracing techniques","2012","This paper sets the foundation for the use of freely available Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) thermal infrared (TIR) imagery in a regional scale assessment of submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) to coastal waters. A comprehensive, tiered, three-step approach is proposed as the most effective and affordable means to determine the spatial extent and scale of SGD from coastal aquifers to the coastal margin. As the preliminary step, Sea Surface Temperature (SST) values derived from Landsat ETM+ TIR are used to successfully detect plumes of colder water eventually associated with SGD in close proximity to the shoreline. Subsequently, potential sites of SGD are linked to geological features on land acting as possible sources, by combining within a Geographical Information System (GIS), mapped temperature anomalies with ancillary on-shore spatial datasets describing bedrock geology including aquifer fault lines. Finally, nearshore surveys mapping the activity of 222Rn (radon) and salinity are carried out to verify the presence of SGD and provide a qualitative assessment of fresh groundwater inputs to the coastal zone. Practical application of the complete approach in the context of coastal zone management is illustrated through a case-study of the Republic of Ireland. As part of this study, over 30 previously unidentified links between aquifers on land and the sea are shown along the Irish coast, hence illustrating the tight coupling between coastal waters and groundwater inputs at an unprecedented spatial scale. The study demonstrates the potential of the combined applications of remote sensing methods and geochemical tracing techniques for a cost-effective regional-scale assessment of groundwater discharge to coastal waters.","Radon,Landsat ETM+,Submarine groundwater discharge,Salinity,Thermal remote sensing,Geochemical tracing,"
"40 years of changes in sea surface temperature along the western iberian coast","2023","Climate change is causing mean sea surface temperatures (SST) to increase worldwide. However, this increase has not been temporally or spatially uniform, with variations observed depending both on the period considered and the geographic region. In this context, this paper aims to quantify relevant changes in SST along the Western Iberian Coast over the last four decades, through the calculation of trends and anomalies of long-term time series of in situ observations and satellite-derived data. Potential drivers of SST changes were considered using atmospheric and teleconnections time series. Changes in the seasonal cycle of SST were also evaluated. We show that SST has increased since 1982, with regional variations between 0.10 and 0.25 °C per decade, with an increase in air temperature appearing to drive the SST trends along the Iberian coast. In the near-shore area, no significant trends or changes in the seasonal cycle of SST were observed, which is likely due to a buffer effect caused by the seasonal upwelling that characterizes the region. Recent decades show a slowdown in the increase rate of SST along the Western Iberian Coast. An upwelling intensification could justify this observation, along with the effect of teleconnections on the regional climate, such as the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the Western Mediterranean Oscillation Index (WeMOI). Our results suggest that the WeMOI plays a more important role in coastal SST variability than the other teleconnections.

"carbon and nitrogen elemental and isotopic ratios of filter-feeding bivalves along the french coasts: an assessment of specific, geographic, seasonal and multi-decadal variations","2018","Primary consumers play a key role in coastal ecosystems by transferring organic matter from primary producers to predators. Among them, suspension-feeders, like bivalve molluscs are widely used in trophic web studies. The main goal of this study was to investigate variations of C and N elemental and isotopic ratios in common bivalves (M. edulis, M. galloprovincialis, and C. gigas) at large spatial (i.e. among three coastal regions) and different temporal (i.e. from seasonal to multi-decadal) scales in France, in order to identify potential general or specific patterns and speculate on their drivers. The observed spatial variability was related to the trophic status of the coastal regions (oligotrophic Mediterranean Sea versus meso- to eutrophic English Channel and Atlantic ocean), but not to ecosystem typology (estuaries, versus lagoons versus bays versus littoral systems). Furthermore, it highlighted local specificities in terms of the origin of the POM assimilated by bivalves (e.g., mainly continental POM vs. marine phytoplankton vs. microphytobenthic algae). Likewise, seasonal variability was related both to the reproduction cycle for C/N ratios of Mytilus spp. and to changes in trophic resources for δ13C of species located close to river mouth. Multi-decadal evolution exhibited shifts and trends for part of the 30-year series with decreases in δ13C and δ15N. Specifically, shifts appeared in the early 2000's, likely linking bivalve isotopic ratios to a cascade of processes affected by local drivers.","Carbon,Coastal ecosystems,Elemental and isotope ratios,France,Nitrogen,Bivalves,"

"knowledge discovery using genetic algorithm for maritime situational awareness","2014","Due to the large volume of data related to vessels, to manually pore through and to analyze the information in a bid to identify potential maritime threat is tedious, if at all possible. This study aims to enhance maritime situational awareness through the use of computational intelligence techniques in detecting anomalies. A knowledge discovery system based on genetic algorithm termed as GeMASS was proposed and investigated in this research. In the development of GeMASS, a machine learning approach was applied to discover knowledge that is applicable in characterizing maritime security threats. Such knowledge is often implicit in datasets and difficult to discover by human analysts. As the knowledge relevant to maritime security may vary from time to time, GeMASS was specified to learn from streaming data and to generate up-to-date knowledge in a dynamic fashion. Based on the knowledge discovered, the system functions to screen vessels for anomalies in real-time. Traditionally in maritime security studies, datasets that are applied as knowledge sources are related to vessels’ geographical and movement information. This study investigated a novel leverage of multiple data sources, including Automatic Identification System, classification societies, and port management and security systems for the enhancement of maritime security. A prototype of GeMASS was developed and employed as a vehicle to study and demonstrate the functions of the proposed methodology.","Defense,Maritime security,Genetic algorithm,Knowledge discovery,Decision support,Machine learning,"

"intelligent decision making solutions for maritime search and rescue missions","2022","Safety accidents are always the key issue for enterprises to prevent and avoid, and offshore accidents are particularly hard to resolve due to their special geographical characteristics. Marine accidents not only bring a large number of casualties, but also generate large property losses. In addition, the marine environment will also be affected to a certain extent. In the event of a maritime accident, the efficiency of maritime search and rescue work is seriously affected by the relatively complex rescue environment due to the large number of factors affecting maritime disasters, which makes it difficult to develop maritime search and rescue measures in a short period of time. The result is infected with the intuitive impact brought by human factors on maritime search and rescue work. In order to avoid the impact of human factors, the maritime intelligent auxiliary decision-making system should be actively built to assist the commander to judge the maritime accident information, and do a good job of scientific and reasonable search and rescue guidance work. Especially in the situation of rapid development of information technology, the construction of artificial intelligence-based auxiliary system for maritime search and rescue to provide strong technical support, are to ensure the safe development of the maritime industry, should increase the research on intelligent auxiliary decision-making system, so that it becomes a cornerstone to help commanders quickly improve the maritime search and rescue program, leading them to work smoothly.",""
"thirty years of assessing the impacts of climate change on outdoor recreation and tourism in canada","2018","This paper reviews 30 peer-reviewed academic journals articles (1986–2016) that assess the impacts of climate change on outdoor recreation and tourism in Canada. The review follows a sector-based approach, covering the various activities that have been assessed within a Canadian context. In general, climate change is expected to present increased risks for cold-weather activities in Canada, while there may be increased opportunities for warm-weather activities. A series of knowledge gaps are identified and recommendations for future research in the field are made. Emphasis is placed on overcoming limitations associated with reliance on out-dated climate science, climate models and climate change scenarios; addressing the uneven geographic distribution of existing assessments and filling the gap regarding regions that are currently underrepresented; as well as exploring the weather sensitivity and potential climate change impacts for outdoor recreation and tourism activities that have not yet been assessed.","Climate change impacts,Outdoor recreation and tourism,Canada,"
"twelve years of geophysical research in the charlevoix seismic zone","1988","Various and extensive geophysical monitoring began in 1974 in the Charlevoix Seismic Zone (CSZ). The historical record and a major earthquake in 1925 characterize this zone as the likely site of a future damaging earthquake (i.e. M = 5.5 or larger) and the aim of the monitoring was to develop the capability of predicting such earthquakes. The parameters studied included: microseismicity, seismic travel times, electrical impedance, vertical movement, horizontal movement, tilt, gravity change, and strain through water well level changes. Although no clear precursor was detected in the months before the largest seismic event that occurred during the observation period (M = 5.0), the multiparameter experiment provided new insights into the structure and the mechanics of this active region. Observations of several hundred well-located microearthquakes have permitted the delineation of ancient rift faults that are now being activated by high horizontal compression. The geographical extent of the zone is sharply defined by the microseismicity which occurs in an area of 35 km × 80 km straddling the St. Lawrence River. Observation of P-waves from accurately-timed explosions and S-waves from earthquakes support the hypothesis of Extensive Dilatancy Anisotropy (EDA) involving saturated parallel cracks in the crust. The data have permitted an estimate of both crack density and the direction for the principal compressive stress in the region (N 30° E). Changes in electrical parameters with periods of months to years were detected at five of the six magnetotelluric stations installed in the region. Changes in the polarization angle of the earth's electrical (telluric) field correlated well (for seven years) with calculated groundwater accumulation levels at one site. Electric impedance changes showed no clear correlation from station to station, but changes at one station appear to correlate with a seismic P-wave travel time change anomaly and with the disappearance of a negative gravity anomaly at the time of an unusual number of earthquakes in the range M = 2 to 3 from mid 1976 to mid 1977. It is suggested that these correlated changes could be related to aseismic stress redistribution and fluid flow along one of the NE striking rift faults about two years before theM = 5.0 earthquake in 1979. Continuous monitoring of tilt (surface and borehole) and well-water levels was carried out at a single site (Charlevoix Geophysical Observatory). Although there were unexplained near-surface tilts of the order of the earth tide amplitude within two or three days before some earthquakes, they were either not spatially coherent or were related to small unexplained temperature changes in the tiltmeter vault. No intermediate-term (one week to one year) precursors were seen against a noise level of 1–3 μrad (RMS) for near-surface tilt observations and a noise level of 0.2–0.3 μrad (RMS) for borehole tilt measurements at a depth of 50–100 m. The threshold of detectable tidal tilt admittance changes for the borehole tiltmeters was lowered to 2% but no significant changes were seen. Four coseismic changes in the levels of water in boreholes were observed (all were drops in water level) which were much larger than expected on the basis of elastic dislocation theory. It is suggested that these could be explained either by the collapse of a dilatant zone around the respective hypocentres or by triggered aseisnuc movement on a nearby active fault. Borehole water level tides observed from 1980 to 1986 exhibit significant variations in amplitude and phase which are thought to be the result of time-varying elastic properties in a nearby structure. Some constraints can now be placed on the long-term deformation of the CSZ as a whole from tiltmeter, levelling and horizontal surveys. Data from a levelling array observed from 1976 to 1986 puts a limit of 0.54 μ rad/yr on the secular tilt rate at the observatory: a further limit of 0.1 μ rad/yr is provided by borehole tilt measurements over the period 1983–1986. A limit of 2 cm is placed on vertical movements northwest of the St. Lawrence River by levelling surveys in 1965, 1978, 1980 and 1982. No significant (90% confidence) deviatoric strain has been detected across the CSZ from horizontal control surveys carried out in 1912–1919, 1965, 1978 and 1983: the maximum allowable long-term strain rate across the CSZ from 1919 to 1983 is 0.16 μ strain/yr.",""

"mid-cretaceous sequence stratigraphy and sedimentary cyclicity in the western paris basin","1992","Cenomanian and Turonian depositional patterns of the western Paris Basin are interpreted in terms of sequence stratigraphy. A system tract analysis of the epicontinental “Normandie Basin”, with pelagic chalks, and of the “Maine Platform” covered by clastics, provides evidence for relative changes in coastal onlap; various minor uncomformities are related to these changes of sea level. The four global cycles (UZA or ZC-2.2/2.5) of Haq et al. (1987, 1988) are recognised while an additional one is proposed for the Geslinianum Zone. In addition, periodic rhythmic cycles are commonly registered within the chalk, expressed by the repitition of various facies enhanced both by biosedimentary processes and diagenetic alteration. These elementary climatic cycles allow accurate lithostratigraphic correlations. During this period when the sea level peaked on the tectonically passive border of the Armorican block, the Paris Basin appears to record a detailed set of events which can be correlated with those in the Atlantic, Boreal and Tethyan provinces.

"measurement campaign and mathematical model construction for the ship zodiak magnetic signature reproduction","2021","The paper presents the partial work done within the framework of the EDA Siramis II project focused on magnetic signature reproduction of ships. Reproduction is understood here as the ability to determine the magnetic anomaly of the local Earth magnetic field in any direction and at any measurement depth due to the presence of the analysed object. The B-91 type hydrographic ship Zodiak was selected as the real case study. The work was divided into two main stages: the development of a measurement campaign taking into account physical measurements, and the development of a mathematical model on the basis of the measured values. The measurement campaign included: preparation of the measuring range, selection of equipment for the measurement of magnetic quantities and geographical location, and data recording while the ship passes the measuring point according to the designated course. As a result of the measurement campaign, magnetic flux density components were collected in different positions in relation to the measuring instruments and the ship's heading. A multi-dipole model was used to build the mathematical model in accordance with the idea of inverse modelling. The effectiveness of this model was previously checked on synthetic data of virtual ships generated using the finite element method. Experiments performed with simulation models were helpful in determining the structure of the model, the nature of the data, and the number of samples needed to properly determine the multi-dipole model parameters. The parameters were determined using the nonlinear least squares method according to the idea of data fitting. The classical Ridge and Lasso regularization methods were applied to prevent the developed multi-dipole model from overfitting. Other regularization methods based on GPS accuracy marks and modification of fitness functions were also considered. The verification was done using real data: the data generated by the model was compared with patterns recorded during the Zodiak measurement campaign. High degree of conformity of the shape of characteristics was obtained. Moreover, the correctness of model execution was confirmed by low values of quantitative indices such as RMSE and MAE representing modelling errors. The methodology presented in the paper is quite universal and can be used to determine the signatures of other ferromagnetic objects.","Sea measurements,Magnetic anomaly detection,Magnetic variables measurement,Magnetic signatures,Model checking,Electromagnetic modelling,Marine vehicles,Magnetic fields,"
"a maritime data analytics platform for policy recommendation","2015","The Aegean Sea is characterized by an extremely high marine safety risk, mainly due to the significant increase of the traffic of tankers from and to the Black Sea that pass through narrow straits formed by the 1600 Greek islands.

"annual ice volume changes 1976–2008 for the new zealand southern alps","2012","New Zealand has a long, continuous record of annual end-of-summer-snowline measurements for a set of Southern Alps ‘index glaciers’ from 1977 to present. These index glaciers are used to estimate annual mass balance and volume water equivalent changes for the over 3000 glaciers on the Southern Alps. Two methods are employed to monitor ice volume changes. Method I deals with the rapid to normal response time glaciers, which tend to be small to medium in size. It uses mass balance gradients and glacier areas to convert changes in snowlines to changes in ice volume water equivalent. Ice volume changes for the period 1976–2008 are calculated for each index glacier, and then extrapolated to most other glaciers of the Southern Alps, using the New Zealand glacier inventory. Method II deals with 12 protracted response glaciers, which tend to be large in size. These have been slow in reacting to a long-term regional warming trend. Instead they still largely retain the ablation areas of a century ago and are in a state of disequilibrium with the present climate. These valley glaciers have recently sustained substantial ice losses that are not able to be detected using Method I. Mass balance deficits and ablation from the 12 large protracted response glaciers are estimated using a geodetic approach based on topographic and lake changes determined from repeated surveys. Results show that estimated ice volume (in water equivalents) for the Southern Alps has decreased from 54.5km3 in 1976 to 46.1km3 by 2008. This equates to a rate of −0.3km3a−1 over the last three decades, but this is considerably less than the rate of ice volume loss estimated for the previous 100years. More than 3000 small and medium-size glaciers account for just 29% of the overall ice volume loss from the Southern Alps, while 71% of the loss occurs from the 12 large protracted response glaciers. Terminus calving contributes 0.8km3 and down-wasting of ice tongues in the ablation zone contributes 5.2km3. Some preliminary results show that ice volume changes are related to changes in circulation over the New Zealand region.","End-of-summer snowline,Ice volume,Glacier mass balance,Proglacial lake,Climate connections,ELA,"
"heterogeneous graph neural networks with denoising for graph embeddings","2022","With the increasing popularity of graph structures, Graph embedding, Which aims to project nodes into low dimensional space while preserving the topological structure information of graphs and the information of nodes themselves, Has attracted an increased amount of attention in recent years. most of the embedding methods based on heterogeneous graphs use a meta-path guided random walk to capture the semantic and structural correlation between different types of nodes in the graph. despite the success of the meta-path-guided heterogeneous graph embedding method, The choice of meta-path is still an open and challenging problem. the design of the meta-path scheme largely depends on domain knowledge. in this paper, We propose a heterogeneous graph neural network with denoising (HGNND) to handle the issue. considering that there are different types of nodes in heterogeneous graphs, And their features are usually distributed in different spaces, The HGNND projects features of different types of nodes into a common vector space. then, The whole heterogeneous graph is input into the graph neural network to aggregate the neighbor node information and capture the structure information of the heterogeneous graph. finally, The noise nodes that may affect the performance of the whole model are filtered out by the denoising operation. extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance, It further proves that the model can still effectively aggregate semantic information without using meta-paths.","Graph neural networks,Graph embedding,Heterogeneous graph,Denoising,"
"insights from archaeological analysis and interpretation of marine data sets to inform marine cultural heritage management and planning of wave and tidal energy development for orkney waters and the pentland firth, ne scotland","2014","The Orkney archipelago has a rich heritage that includes the Heart of Neolithic Orkney World Heritage Site, Viking settlements, harbours supplying Hudson's Bay Company ships, and the wartime naval base of Scapa Flow. This rich history has left its mark on the seabed but accurate maps showing the location and character of surviving seabed archaeology do not exist to the same extent as for archaeology on land. ORCA Marine was commissioned by Historic Scotland to work with the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland in interrogating marine data sets to enhance historic environment records of Orkney Waters and the Pentland Firth. These waters were prioritised for their history of maritime activity and to help guide planning and developments in an area highlighted by the Scottish Government for marine renewable energy. A variety of recent and legacy datasets, including wreck databases; sonar data gathered by public sector bodies; aerial photography; seabed cores; Admiralty charts; and local knowledge, were examined for their effectiveness in discovering and interpreting marine cultural heritage cost-effectively. A methodology was developed that enabled marine cultural heritage information to be quickly assimilated within the national and regional inventories for dissemination online. Polygonisation of records resulted in GIS-based shapefiles identifying site extents, and areas of archaeological potential in relation to wrecks, submerged prehistoric landscapes, anchorages and fishing areas. Substantial gaps in data coverage were identified and areas of the seabed have been surveyed at resolutions that are sufficient to detect large upstanding remains such as iron shipwrecks but insufficient to identify smaller archaeological features. Other geophysical datasets have been created at a resolution detailed enough to allow the recognition of smaller anomalies but in some cases processing of the data has removed small anomalies of interest to archaeologists. Intensively used marine areas often contain the most artefactual remains such as historic ports being developed to service the marine renewable industry. Zones of high wave and tidal energy favoured for renewable energy devices include navigation channels and hazards where a large number of wrecks are documented. Transmission cable routes cross deep water where 20th-century wartime losses occurred. Planning and development of infrastructure relating to renewables may also interact with significant built heritage and archaeology on the foreshore and coast edge.",""
"dem analyses and morphotectonic interpretation: the plio-quaternary evolution of the eastern ligurian alps, italy","2012","The Ligurian Alps (Italy) straddle a complex and ill-defined tectonic transition that accommodates Eurasia–Adria shortening driving concurrent growth of the western Alps and northern Apennines. We focus on the Plio-Quaternary landscape evolution of the eastern part of the Ligurian Alps with the goal of defining the active tectonics through an analysis of topography, drainage networks, and river long profiles. The Ligurian Alps have a steep, seaward-facing escarpment with topographic features reminiscent of the geomorphic markers preserved on both actively-uplifting coastlines and passive margins. For example, there are seaward-facing benches that are thought to be uplifted marine terraces common to active margins; but the drainage divide of the seaward escarpment shows clear evidence of recent northward migration into the Po foreland, a process consistent with escarpment retreat characteristic of passive or subsiding margins. This study explores the active tectonics consistent with these diverse landscape evolution pathways. Our analysis reveals that rock-type strongly throttles the development of topographic relief, drainage networks, and northward migration of the drainage divide. However, we also identify segments of the escarpment that indicate recent base level falls through an analysis of modeled channel steepness and comparison with mean hillslope gradient. The base level falls are consistent with numerous barbed tributaries that are best explained as recent stream captures. No significant correlation among the stream captures at the drainage divide, suspected marine terraces at the coast, Ligurian Sea bathymetry, and active seismicity indicates that the escarpment is the footwall of a segmented normal fault. This normal fault is embedded in a regionally subsiding margin where actively uplifting segments lead to a straightened, pinned drainage divide, whereas, relatively inactive segments permit divide migration into the footwall block. These results are broadly consistent with rock uplift increasing eastward toward Genova across the long-suspected Alps–Apennine Sestri–Voltaggio fault zone. They highlight the respective roles of legacy structures, rock-type, and localized rock uplift in constructing a landscape in an otherwise extending and subsiding crustal retrowedge of an active subduction plate boundary.","Tectonic geomorphology,DEM analysis,Ligurian Alps,River longitudinal profile,"
"multi-scale collision risk estimation for maritime traffic in complex port waters","2023","Ship collision risk estimation is an essential component of intelligent maritime surveillance systems. Traditional risk estimation approaches, which can only analyze traffic risk in one specific scale, reveal a significant challenge in quantifying the collision risk of a traffic scenario from different spatial scales. This is detrimental to understanding the traffic situations and supporting effective anti-collision decision-making, particularly as maritime traffic complexity grows and autonomous ships emerge. In this study, a systematic multi-scale collision risk estimation approach is newly developed to capture traffic conflict patterns under different spatial scales. It extends the application of the complex network theory and a node deletion method to quantify the interactions and dependencies among multiple ships within encounter scenarios, enabling collision risk to be evaluated at any spatial scale. Meanwhile, an advanced graph-based clustering framework is introduced to search for the optimal spatial scales for risk evaluation. Extensive numerical experiments based on AIS data in Ningbo_Zhoushan Port are implemented to evaluate the model performance. Experimental results reveal that the proposed approach can strengthen maritime situational awareness, identify high-risk areas and support strategic maritime safety management. This work therefore sheds light on improving the intelligent levels of maritime surveillance and promoting maritime traffic automation.","Intelligent maritime surveillance,Maritime safety,Multi-scale collision risk,Graph clustering,Network theory,"

"graph signal variation detection: a novel approach for identifying and reconstructing ship ais tangled trajectories","2023","Tangles are a common anomaly in Automatic Identification System (AIS) data, resulting from disorder in time sequences. They increase the spatial complexity of trajectories, making existing methods unable to fully recognize and process them. This will seriously affect the analysis of ship behavior. Furthermore, existing methods often directly remove after recognition, resulting in a significant loss of local information. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an algorithm called Graph Signal Variation Detection (GSVD) to recognize and reconstruct tangles. Initially, data preprocessing is conducted to remove redundant and stationary points. Then, construct the vertices and edges of the graph using indicators integrating AIS data features and ship trajectories, respectively. The tangled region is identified by calculating the total variation theory of the graph. The tangled region is reconstructed using the greedy heuristic, and the optimal reconstruction path is determined by combining total variation quantization. Finally, the GSVD is compared with four prevailing methods, through qualitative and quantitative analyses. The results demonstrate that the GSVD surpasses the other methods in terms of recognition accuracy, recall rates, and false alarm rates. Additionally, the GSVD can effectively reconstruct the tangle.","Total variation,Trajectory preprocessing,Graph signal,AIS data,Greedy algorithm,"

The study was conducted on the Atlantic coast of Morocco at two selected points along Safi shores, a supposed clean station and a recognized metal-contaminated one. The main objectives were to assess the pollution status of these two stations and to highlight the environmental and human risks associated with metal contamination. The bioavailability and the bioaccumulation of the selected metals, several physiological and biometric parameters of mussels were assessed at both sampling stations. As expected, the station located near industry plants showed the highest metal concentrations in the two compartments and was associated with lower values in the physiological and biometric indices. At the mussel scale, inter-station and inter-tissue variations in metal concentrations were observed showing a preferential accumulation within the digestive gland. Besides, strong reliable negative relations of Cd and Cu concentrations were obtained with physiological indices. Surprisingly, a significant occurrence of both selected metals was recorded at the location assumed as a reference station. Therefore, the hypothesis that this station presumed to be clean and currently used as a control station must be reconsidered. As for the risk for the consumer, the estimated daily intake (EDI) of Cd and Cu indicated a potential health risk through mussel consumption since the EDI values were markedly above the international guidelines and threshold levels for human consumption. Finally, our data were compared to those previously obtained along the Safi coastline (NW Morocco) and other geographical regions, including the Mediterranean and western Atlantic areas within the temperate zone.","Bioaccumulation,Mediterranean blue mussel,Pollution indices,Risk assessment,Metal contamination,Marine sediments,"

These instruments are to be used in synergy to: &#x02022;Improve the analysis of measured wind and ocean wave fields, and thereby improve weather forecasting at weather centers;&#x02022;Determine the extent and variables of sea ice and develop a five-day sea ice prediction model, to support maritime shipping and offshore activities;&#x02022;Monitor and map sediment and suspended matter transport in coastal regions, especially in areas with large river estuaries, which greatly affects shipping lanes, harbors, and dredging activities;&#x02022;Monitor hydrobiological and bio-geochemical variables related to water quality in coastal regions and large inland waters, which affects ecology, coastal development, aquaculture, drinking water supplies, and tourism. To prepare the oceanographic community to make best use of the ENVISAT sensors in the pre-launch phase, existing algorithms to derive marine parameters are used and validated using data from the ERS SAR, the ERS RA, SeaWiFS and IRS MOS sensors now in operation. Derived products are used to address problems that can best be tackled using the synergy of radar and optical data, such as the effect of surface slicks on radar wind measurements, of sea state on ocean color, of wind and waves on the resuspension of suspended matter, and of wind and waves on sea ice variables.",""
"10 - wine laws, authentication and geography","2014","Wine production, like any modern product, is regulated by a variety of statutes, designed largely to protect the consumer but also the producer. This is especially so relative to wine. Because these dictates vary considerably from country to country, only the basic concepts associated with Appellation Control laws are described, with their relevance to terroir protection. Details are provided for several major wine regions. As laws are effective only to the degree to which they are enforced and compliance can be verified, the methods by which wine provenance can be validated, and compliance with other statutes detected, are examined. This leads into a discussion of the climatic, soil, varietal, viticultural, and enologic features that distinguish European, African, Asian, Oceanian, and South and North American wine-producing regions.","Appellation Control laws,wine fraud detection,wine regions,"
"palaeolimnological evidence for widespread late 18th century drought across equatorial east africa","2008","The sediment records of three shallow climate-sensitive lakes in equatorial East Africa (Chibwera and Kanyamukali in western Uganda, and Baringo in central Kenya) contain clear lithological evidence of an episode of complete desiccation in the relatively recent past. Quantitative stratigraphic analyses of bulk sediment composition, texture (% sand and coarse organic detritus), the C/N ratio of bulk organic matter, and magnetic susceptibility allowed us to define a common succession of sedimentary units in all three lakes. This common stratigraphy includes a basal unit of dry and stiff low-organic clays capped by a horizon of peaty mud or peat, overlain by organic lake sediment. We interpret this stratigraphy to represent an episode of (nearly) complete desiccation of these lake basins. This was followed first by an early phase of modest lake refilling, during which time extensive littoral and submerged vegetation developed, producing peaty lake deposits. Mostly higher lake levels later on resulted in deposition of fine-grained lake muds. Using 210Pb and 137Cs activity profiles combined with four AMS 14C dates on single terrestrial plant macrofossils or multiple charred grass particles indicate that in all three lakes the episode of most recent complete desiccation occurred in the late 18th and early 19th century. These results add to an accumulating body of palaeoenvironmental data revealing a prolonged period of extreme drought in equatorial East Africa about 200 years ago, also documented in the cultural history of the African Great Lakes region. Given the geographical spread of the study lakes across the East African plateau, these results indicate that the climatic anomaly of reduced rainfall responsible for this drought was at least sub-continental in scale.","Tropical East Africa,Palaeoclimate,Late Holocene,Sediment stratigraphy,Lake Baringo,Lake-sediment records,"

"integrated late quaternary chronostratigraphy for san salvador island, bahamas: patterns and trends of morphological change in the land snail cerion","2008","Reconstructing the phylogeny and biogeography of the Caribbean land snail Cerion requires a robust stratigraphic and chronological framework. To this end, we have determined the stratigraphic succession on San Salvador, a Bahamian island with a rich fossil and modern Cerion fauna. A primary purpose of this paper is to independently verify this succession through whole-rock and Cerion aminostratigraphies and AMS 14C-based age models. Over 150 individual Cerion shells were age-ranked from 140 ka to modern using stratigraphic position and reverse-phase HPLC (RPC) amino acid racemization, which was sufficiently sensitive to resolve stratigraphic subunits within the Holocene and late Pleistocene. A secondary purpose of this paper is to assess broad changes in the gross morphology (height, width) of supersets of Cerion from age-ranked lots spanning this ~140 kyr chronostratigraphy. Through each of the three interglacial sequences (i.e., marine isotope stages 5e, 5a, and 1), between-sample trends in mean gross morphology often greatly exceed within-sample variances (±1σ). Live-collected Cerion exhibit a range in gross morphology that nearly encompasses that of the entire fossil sequence. A trend of increasing gross shell size characterizes each of the interglacial phases, with a major step-decrease between marine isotope stages 5a and 1. While between-unit variation is often great in Cerion from SSI, within-unit variation appears unimodal through the record.","land snails,Reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography,The Bahamas,San Salvador Islands,Accelerator mass spectrometry C chronology,Biostratigraphy,Amino acid racemization,"
"integrated characterization of ancient burial mounds using ert and limited drillings at the hepu han tombs, in coastal area of southern china","2019","The Hepu Han Tombs, located on the south coast of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, in southern China, bordering the Beibu Gulf, can date back to the Han dynasty (206 BCE–220 CE), when Hepu was an important international trade port of the maritime Silk Road, spreading strong and persistent cultural influence to neighboring countries from ancient China, and also connecting China with African, European and other Asian countries in national migration, religious communication, political, trade, technical and cultural exchanges, and so on. The research of the Hepu Han Tombs can offer opportunities to understand the burial customs and the Han culture in the Chinese Han Dynasty. With the aim of detecting the location, depth and geometry of two burial mounds at Jinjiling Site of Hepu Han Tombs, an electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) survey was performed in cooperation with archaeological team to calibrate the results with detailed information from the limited drillings in the area. Besides, series of 2-D ERT sections, acquired above the larger mound, were combined into a “Pseudo 3-D” volume, and iso-resistivity surfaces were further calculated to emphasize the location and lateral variations within the data volume, expected towards a more detailed and quantitative interpretation. Both the 2-D and 3-D resistivity imaging gave a clear evidence of structural details of the burial mounds. The results have shown a general consistency between the geophysical work and traditional archaeological drilling explorations, improving our knowledge on the un-excavated mounds, and allowing detailed pre-excavation plan at the Hepu Han Tombs.","Burial mounds,Hepu Han Tombs,Electrical resistivity tomography (ERT),Drillings,"
"stratigraphic pattern of soil remnants, cultural and colluvial deposits in a small dry valley in the viking settlement hedeby, northern germany","2023","This study aimed to identify spatial distribution of soil remnants, colluvial and cultural deposits in a small dry valley of the early medieval Viking settlement Hedeby; reconstruct factors of soil destruction and main phases of deposits formation. Hedeby (54° 29′ 27.77″ N, 9° 33′ 54.42″ E) is located approximately 40 km northwest of Kiel, Northern Germany, at the western shore of the lake Haddebyer Noor. The protected status of the settlement as a UNESCO heritage site predetermined the choice of a minimum-destructive technique of coring. The stratigraphy demonstrated that the main factors of soil destruction were surface erosion, incorporation of the soil horizon A into a cultural layer and extraction of soil material for earthwork formation such as construction of the semi-circular fortification rampart. Buried soil horizons were additionally mixed by active local bioturbation. Three periods of deposit formation were identified. The occurrence of soil erosion due to intensive deforestation in the earliest period of settlement erection was indicated by the deepest colluvial layer M1. During the Viking settlement period formation of the exposed colluvial layer M2 and cultural deposits must have been simultaneous but at different locations. After the Viking Age settlement period, the erosion was activated by agricultural land use in late medieval time. This was clearly seen in the central part of the valley, where cultural deposits were covered by colluvium. This study closes a gap in the long-term archaeological and geoarchaeological study of Hedeby, i.e. it contributes to the discussion of the relationship between human activity and landscape development in this significant settlement. Moreover, it brings new knowledge on the large-scale vision of the landscape transformation performed by Viking Age settlers.","Viking Age,Hedeby,Colluvial deposits,Deposit modeling,Past soil erosion,Palaeoenvironmental reconstruction,"

"satellite-based communications security: a survey of threats, solutions, and research challenges","2022","Satellite-based Communication (SATCOM) systems are gaining renewed momentum in Industry and Academia, thanks to innovative services introduced by leading tech companies and the promising impact they can deliver towards the global connectivity objective tackled by early 6G initiatives. On the one hand, the emergence of new manufacturing processes and radio technologies promises to reduce service costs while guaranteeing outstanding communication latency, available bandwidth, flexibility, and coverage range. On the other hand, cybersecurity techniques and solutions applied in SATCOM links should be updated to reflect the substantial advancements in attacker capabilities characterizing the last two decades. However, business urgency and opportunities are leading operators towards challenging system trade-offs, resulting in an increased attack surface and a general relaxation of the available security services. In this paper, we tackle the cited problems and present a comprehensive survey on the link-layer security threats, solutions, and challenges faced when deploying and operating SATCOM systems. Specifically, we classify the literature on security for SATCOM systems into two main branches, i.e., physical-layer security and cryptography schemes. Then, we further identify specific research domains for each of the identified branches, focusing on dedicated security issues, including, e.g., physical-layer confidentiality, anti-jamming schemes, anti-spoofing strategies, and quantum-based key distribution schemes. For each of the above domains, we highlight the most essential techniques, peculiarities, advantages, disadvantages, lessons learned, and future directions. Finally, we also identify emerging research topics whose additional investigation by Academia and Industry could further attract researchers and investors, ultimately unleashing the full potential behind ubiquitous satellite communications.","GNSS spoofing,Quantum key distribution for satellites,Satellite-drones communications,Cryptography for satellites,6G,Satellites cybersecurity,Satellites jamming,3GPP,"
"a visibility graph approach for path planning and real-time collision avoidance on maritime unmanned systems","2021","In high navigation traffic areas, path planning and collision avoidance is a crucial element of safe navigation, mostly in view of possible future applications in hybrid scenarios where both manned and Autonomous Surface Vehicles (ASV) share the environment.This paper deals with a novel procedure to generate optimal paths in presence of static and moving obstacles. The proposed path planning approach deals with an optimization problem based on the so-called Essential Visibility Graph (EVG) [1], an extension of the standard Visibility Graph (VG) [2], in order to find the minimum cost piecewise linear path between two points in a scenario with several obstacles. Such approach can be used also in presence of multiple ASV or movable obstacles, by using a re-planning procedure to update the EVG over a selected prediction time interval. To make the solution compliant with the current regulation and make ASV behaviour predictable by human pilots on manned vehicles, EVG was extended by implementing a cut procedure based on Collision Regulations (COLREGS) [3]. Finally, the use of Dubins curves provides smooth paths, compliant with physics constraints such as the minimum turn radius.A campaign of numerical simulations was carried out to test the effectiveness of the proposed technique in different operational scenarios. Results show that the algorithm is always able to identify COLREGS-compliant trajectories, in order to avoid collisions and assure minimum safety distance as well. Furthermore, the low computational burden suggests that the proposed procedure can be considered a promising approach for real-time applications.","minimum turn radius,real-time collision avoidance,Autonomous Surface Vehicles,Regulation,Safety,operational scenarios,Costs,COLREGS-compliant trajectories,standard visibility graph,real-time applications,Dubins curves,maritime unmanned systems,movable obstacles,optimization problem,essential visibility graph,cut procedure,manned autonomous surface vehicles,prediction time interval,optimal paths,optimisation,EVG,smooth paths,Essential Visibility Graph,Real-time systems,graph theory,minimum cost piecewise linear path,path planning approach,Numerical simulation,COLREGs,unmanned surface vehicles,mobile robots,high navigation traffic areas,Collision Avoidance,multiple ASV,Navigation,collision avoidance,re-planning procedure,Heuristic algorithms,"

This generic model defines adequate and necessary node types, well suited for modeling of identification and assessment tasks. In addition, the model provides a dependency structure by subgraphs, which simplifies provision of more complex cause-effect relations in Bayesian Identification Networks.

"the amphi-atlantic distribution of the younger dryas paleoclimatic oscillation","1989","Interest in significant climatic fluctuations affecting large geographic areas but having a time range that is too brief to adduce the Milankovitch radiation cycles has focused on the Alleröd/Younger Dryas event, which is a well-established phenomenon of western Europe manifested by glacial and vegetational reconstructions. It is also shown by the foraminiferal evidence for shifts in the polar front in the North Atlantic. Recent pollen and lithostratigraphic investigations in the Maritime Provinces of eastern Canada and in the till plains of west-central Ohio on opposite sides of the late-glacial spruce forest indicate that the event also left a record in eastern North America. Experiments with an atmospheric general circulation model, with the temperature of North Atlantic surface waters depressed to full-glacial levels, lowered summer temperatures in ‘upwind’ periglacial eastern North America by 2°C — just as far inland as they did downwind in western Europe, where the paleoecological record of cooling is clear. A leading hypothesis for the cause for the Younger Dryas cooling appeals to the influx of tabular icebergs released from arctic ice shelves around the wasting Scandinavian and Siberian ice sheets during the Alleröd warming. The resulting cooling of the North Atlantic waters during the Younger Dryas could be facilitated or precipitated by the abrupt influx of glacial meltwater derived from almost the entire southern margin of the Laurentide ice sheet and emerging from the Gulf of St Lawrence, as brought about by a major shift in drainage direction from the Mississippi River to the St Lawrence River about 10.8 ka BP. A supplemental influx of fresh water may have come from the contemporaneous drainage of the Baltic Ice Lake. The diversion of Laurentide meltwater to the Atlantic was caused by retreat of an ice lobe in northwestern Ontario north of Minnesota, allowing the huge Glacial Lake Agassiz in Saskatchewan and Manitoba to drain into the Great Lakes and more than double the inflow of meltwaters in the North Atlantic, thereby diverting the Gulf Stream and permitting the influx of icebergs from the north to cool the ocean surface. Minor readvance of the ice lobe about 10 ka BP temporarily diverted the Lake Agassiz drainage to the south. With the final retreat of the ice, the drainage again went to the east, but by this time the ice sheets were much diminished and the regional climate had warmed enough so that the effects of the meltwater flux on the Gulf Stream were muted, and the ice sheets bordering the North Atlantic had retreated onto the land and no longer delivered enough icebergs to cool the surface waters. The Younger Dryas interval thus was terminated, and the warming manifested in the Alleröd was renewed.",""
"multi-source remote-sensing monitoring of the monsoonal maritime glaciers at mt. dagu, east qinghai-tibetan plateau, china","2019","This research presents a precise evaluation of the recession of monsoonal maritime glaciers at Mt. Dagu, based on multi-source remote-sensing data of an aerial topographic map from 1966 and Landsat MSS, TM, ETM+, and OLI data from 1975 to 2017 for six sub-regions of the glacier covering 1.747Â±0.068 km2 at present. The results show that: first, the area of glacier exhibits an exponentially decreasing trend and retreated as much as 5.094 Â± 0.301 km2 during 1975-2017, with a shrinkage rate of 0.120 Â± 0.004 km2a-1. Second, the highest area shrinkage rates of glaciers are in the north, northwest, southwest, and south aspects.

The paper proposes and applies a method to define AIS data-based empirical polygonal ship domains, based on traffic density matrices that are derived around each reference ship from an AIS dataset. A modified Quaternion Ship Domain allowing for different shapes for each quadrant is proposed, which results in a better fitting to the empirical domain. The parameters of Quaternion Ship Domains that best fit the empirical polygonal domains are determined for cargo ships and tankers of different lengths. Violations of the Quaternion Ship Domain are then used as an indicator of collision risk that is graphically represented in the study area, providing important information to support maritime traffic monitoring and control tasks.","Collision risk,Automatic identification system (AIS),Maritime traffic,Ship domain,"
"bio-inspired topology control mechanism for autonomous underwater vehicles used in maritime surveillance","2013","Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are increasingly used in maritime applications to acquire underwater information. With the guidance of intelligent topology control algorithms, AUVs adjust their positions efficiently such that they achieve desired underwater wireless sensor network (UWSN) configurations. A suitable application can be using AUVs in surveillance tasks, where they uniformly spread throughout a harbor entry or around a large civilian or military maritime vessel (e.g., an aircraft carrier) to detect any hostile or unexpected underwater intrusions. Since geographical characteristics are different for each port (shape, depth, etc.) and underwater currents constantly change, manually controlling underwater vehicles for these tasks is not feasible. In this paper, we present a particle swarm optimization (PSO) based topology control mechanism, called 3D-PSO, for AUVs operating in unknown 3D underwater spaces. 3D-PSO uses limited information collected from an AUV's neighborhood to make movement decisions over an unknown 3D space. Each AUV, using our 3D-PSO, is able to adjust its movement speed and direction to achieve a better location towards obtaining a uniform distribution. Simulation experiments demonstrate that, despite the significant variance of topographies of harbor entrances and the undersides of ships, 3D-PSO is an efficient tool to guide AUVs in creating a protection area for a harbor or a maritime vessel.","surveillance,topology control,bio-inspired topology control mechanism,harbor entrances,underwater information,civilian vessel,bio-inspired algorithms,particle swarm optimisation,3D-PSO,underwater wireless sensor networks,protection area,Network topology,wireless sensor networks,Topology,maritime surveillance,self-organizing networks,particle swarm optimization,autonomous underwater vehicles,Underwater vehicles,unknown 3D underwater spaces,harbor entry,surveillance tasks,military maritime vessel,Nickel,UWSN configurations,marine vehicles,intelligent topology control algorithms,underwater wireless sensor network configuration,AUVs,security,unexpected underwater intrusion detection,Mobile nodes,geographical characteristics,"
"seasonal oceanography from physics to micronekton in the south-west pacific","2015","Tuna catches represent a major economic and food source in the Pacific Ocean, yet are highly variable. This variability in tuna catches remains poorly explained. The relationships between the distributions of tuna and their forage (micronekton) have been mostly derived from model estimates. Observations of micronekton and other mid-trophic level organisms, and their link to regional oceanography, however are scarce and constitute an important gap in our knowledge and understanding of the dynamics of pelagic ecosystems. To fill this gap, we conducted two multidisciplinary cruises (Nectalis1 and Nectalis2) in the New Caledonian Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) at the southeastern edge the Coral Sea, in 2011 to characterize the oceanography of the region during the cool (August) and the hot (December) seasons. The physical and biological environments were described by hydrology, nutrients and phytoplankton size structure and biomass. Zooplankton biomass was estimated from net sampling and acoustics and micronecton was estimated from net sampling, the SEAPODYM ecosystem model, a dedicated echosounder and non-dedicated acoustics. Results demonstrated that New Caledonia is located in an oligotrophic area characterized by low nutrient and low primary production which is dominated by a high percentage of picoplankton cyanobacteria Prochlorococcus (>90%). The area exhibits a large-scale north–south temperature and salinity gradient. The northern area is influenced by the equatorial Warm Pool and the South Pacific Convergence Zone and is characterized by higher temperature, lower salinity, lower primary production and micronekton biomass. The southern area is influenced by the Tasman Sea and is characterized by cooler temperature, higher salinity, higher primary production and micronekton biomass. The dynamic oceanography and the complex topography create a myriad of mesoscale features including eddies, inducing patchy structures in the ecosystem. During the cool season, a tight coupling existed between the ocean dynamics and primary production, while there was a stronger decoupling during the hot season. There was little difference in the composition of mid-trophic level organisms (zooplankton and micronekton) between the two seasons. This may be due to different turn-over times and delays in the transmission of primary production to upper trophic levels. Examination of various sampling gears for zooplankton and micronekton showed that net biomass estimates and acoustic-derived estimates compared reasonably well. Estimates of micronekton from net observations and the SEAPODYM model were in the same range. The non-dedicated acoustics adequately reproduced trends observed in zooplankton from nets, but the acoustics could not differentiate between zooplankton and micronekton and absolute biomasses could not be calculated. Understanding the impact of mesoscale features on higher trophic levels will require further investigation and patchiness induced by eddies raises the question of how to best sample highly dynamic areas via sea experiments.","Primary production,Oceanographic surveys,Oligotrophic,Zooplankton,Acoustic data,Mesoscale eddies,Nekton,"
"changes in water properties around north pacific intermediate water between the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s","2010","We detected temperature (salinity) decreases on the neutral density surfaces above the salinity minimum and increases below throughout the western North Pacific subtropical gyre (25∘N–40∘N, west of 170∘W) by comparing World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) hydrographic sections from the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s. The temperature (salinity) changes around the salinity minimum were associated with an apparent oxygen utilization (AOU) increase, and could not be explained by an increase of the subpolar input. These property changes were due to a density decrease of the salinity minimum. Furthermore, similar changes in temperature (salinity) were detected along 165∘E as a 12-year trend from 1996 to 2007. This suggests that the changes evident in the comparison of the WOCE sections are the representative of changes at the intermediate depths in the last decade. This pattern was not detected in the eastern subtropical gyre (25∘N–40∘N, east of 170∘W) and along 47∘N, where the AOU increase due to ventilation reduction has been reported.

"combining fm broadcast, accelerometers, ieee 892.15.4 wireless and gps to secure maritime containers worldwide","2010","There are approximately 50 million maritime style containers entering and leaving ports in North America every year and 500 millions worldwide [8]. The interiors of such containers are rarely inspected. With market globalization, a large amount of these containers enter North America on a daily basis. Such containers may include contraband or dangerous items that present an economic or security risk. Despite significant security improvements, only 3 to 5% of the maritime containers, that arrive in or transition through North America, go through physical inspection. Current container tracking technologies solely based on GPS consume high DC power, are costly, require line-of-sight with satellites and they are often too large to be covert. It is possible to overcome some of these limitations by combining GPS with a tracking system based on the FM broadcast signal. Digital FM broadcast is an alternative man-made signal that is ubiquitous, provides a geographically unique frequency spectrum and is about 100,000 as strong as a GPS satellite signal. The combination of GPS and FM, called 'Broadcast Assisted GPSâ„¢' allows the development of a low-cost, low-power and miniature FM-GPS receiver that can trace the path that a container has taken for less than 25$ per container. This paper presents the first results of highway trials (train and sea trials are to be conducted in 2010-2011) of such a low cost, covert, 'Broadcast Assisted GPS'based technology, called 'FM-RFID Tagâ„¢' that records the worldwide displacement of containers and displays the path undertaken by the container while in transit.

"north american vegetation dynamics observed with multi-resolution satellite data","2008","We investigated normalized difference vegetation index data from the NOAA series of Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometers and found regions in North America that experienced marked increases in annual photosynthetic capacity at various times from 1982 to 2005. Inspection of these anomalous areas with multi-resolution data from Landsat, Ikonos, aerial photography, and ancillary data revealed a range of causes for the NDVI increases: climatic influences; severe drought and subsequent recovery; irrigated agriculture expansion; insect outbreaks followed by logging and subsequent regeneration; and forest fires with subsequent regeneration. Vegetation in areas in the high Northern Latitudes appear to be solely impacted by climatic influences. In other areas examined, the impact of anthropogenic effects is more direct. The pattern of NDVI anomalies over longer time periods appear to be driven by long-term climate change but most appear to be associated with climate variability on decadal and shorter time scales along with direct anthropogenic land cover conversions. The local variability of drivers of change demonstrates the difficulty in interpreting changes in NDVI and indicates the complex nature of changes in the carbon cycle within North America. Coarse scale analysis of changes could well fail to identify the important local scale drivers controlling the carbon cycle and to identify the relative roles of disturbance and climate change.

In this paper we discuss the relationship between uncertain conceptual graphs and belief functions. We put forward a fusion process which allows for taking advantage of evidential reasoning capabilities in a multi-entity context. We show how information from conceptual graphs can be fed into or represented as an evidential networks and how the inference results obtained from valuation networks can be used to generate a probability distribution on conceptual graphs.

"cyber-physical framework for early integration of autonomous maritime capabilities","2013","The increasing demand for more self-governed assistance in maritime activities is leading ocean engineering research projects to combine diverse autonomous capabilities developed at geographically-dispersed locations. Availability of such capabilities as well as experiments in water is a critical issue that can seriously impact on the project milestones. The ability to perform verification and validation at an initial integration stage of maritime capabilities while they are still physically located at the partner's site can reduce significantly costs and risks. This paper proposes an early integration framework for autonomous capabilities of maritime vehicles by means of system and context simulation (including emulation of maritime vehicles and operational environment). This makes interaction between the computational and physical process become crucial as in cyber-physical systems. The framework proposed allows project patterns to pre-verify and pre-validate requirements before the system is physically integrated. This paper presents a review of the research context, and the autonomous maritime capabilities to be integrated. An illustrative case study of simulation and trials carried out on cooperative maritime navigation is also presented.","maritime vehicles,ocean engineering research projects,physical process,ocean engineering,cyber-physical systems,remote capability development,cooperative maritime navigation,autonomous capabilities,autonomous maritime capabilities,water,Vehicles,geographically-dispersed locations,marine engineering,cyber-physical integration framework,project milestones,computational process,Computer architecture,Robots,Software,maritime autonomy,cyber-physical framework,self-governed assistance,Visualization,Sensors,Navigation,navigation,marine vehicles,maritime activities,"

In such a context, oceanographic high-frequency surface-wave (HFSW) radars could be cost-effective sensors for long-range early-warning ship detection and tracking. In this paper, multi-target tracking and data fusion techniques are applied to real data recorded by three low-power HFSW radars installed in the German Bight of the North Sea. Ship reports from the automatic identification system (AIS) are exploited as ground truth information for assessing system performances. Both in situ and model data are used to investigate the capabilities of the systems according to the variations of the meteorological and oceanographic conditions.

"eprd: exploiting prior knowledge for evidence-providing automatic rumor detection","2023","With the prevalence of social media platforms, rumors have been a serious social problem. Notably, existing rumor detection methods simply provide detection labels while ignoring their explanation. However, illustrating the reasons why a suspicious statement is a rumor is essential. To address this realistic scenario, we propose a novel Evidence-Providing Rumor Detection model called EPRD. EPRD incorporates a wide variety of information from both prior knowledge sources and current comments. It also learns bilaterally friendly representations for interpretable rumor detection. EPRD first retrieves evidence from prior knowledge sources and checks the relationship between the given statement and its evidence. Our model then constructs two heterogeneous graph objects to simulate the propagation layout of the current comments and evidence relationships. Finally, EPRD integrates the GraphSAGE component and attention mechanism to detect rumors. To the best of our knowledge, we propose the first model that incorporates prior knowledge to verify rumors and boost credibility. Experiments on two real-world Twitter datasets demonstrate that EPRD consistently exhibits the best rumor detection performance. Moreover, EPRD outperforms other baselines in the early rumor detection task.","Deep learning,Graph neural network,Rumor detection,Evidence,Natural language inference,"
"adaptive detection of spatial point event outliers using multilevel constrained delaunay triangulation","2016","Spatial outlier detection is a research hot spot in the field of spatial data mining. Because of the lack of specific research on spatial point events, this study presents an adaptive approach for spatial point events outlier detection (SPEOD) using multilevel constrained Delaunay triangulation. First, the spatial proximity relationships between spatial point events are roughly captured by Delaunay triangulation. Then, three-level constraints are described and used to refine spatial proximity relationships with the consideration of statistical characteristics. Finally, those spatial point events connected by remaining edges are gathered to form a series of subgraphs. Those subgraphs containing very few point events are regarded as spatial outliers. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world spatial data sets are used to show that the proposed SPEOD algorithm can detect various types of spatial point event outliers with high efficiency. Moreover, there is no need to input any parameter in SPEOD.","Spatial point events,Multilevel constrained Delaunay triangulation,Spatial outliers,"
"a machine learning-based accuracy enhancement on eumetsat h-saf h35 effective snow-covered area product","2022","Snow is a major element of the cryosphere with significant impact on the Earth's water cycle and global energy budget. Acquiring consistent and long time series data on the spatial extent of snow cover doubtlessly plays a key role in our understanding and modeling of the current and future environmental dynamics. Remote sensing offers a powerful tool for continuous retrieval of snow cover information by utilizing snow's contrasting reflectance characteristics at optical wavelengths. The pre-operational H35 covers the Northern Hemisphere, and it is the successor of the operational Pan-European H12 daily fractional snow-covered area (fSCA) product at ~1 km. Both products are developed through the Satellite Application Facility on Support to Operational Hydrology and Water Management (H-SAF) project of EUMETSAT by exploiting AVHRR channels. This study is focused on developing an alternative fully data-driven H35 product with improved accuracy using a machine learning (ML)-based approach. Multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) algorithm is trained by using AVHRR reflectance data as well as the well-known snow and vegetation indices (i.e., NDSI and NDVI) to generate the new version of H35 fSCA product. The reference fSCA maps required for the training of MARS models are obtained from the higher resolution Sentinel 2 multispectral imagery. The MARS-based fSCA models are validated against an initial test dataset composed of 15 Sentinel 2 scenes over European Alps, Tatra Mountain Range, and Turkey. The final MARS-H35 product is then rigorously assessed over the whole Northern Hemisphere within a temporal domain spanning from Nov 2018 to Nov 2019. The quantitative testing process involves the use of reference data in both continuous and dichotomous scales: i) Sentinel 2 derived reference fSCA maps, ii) ERA5-Land snow depth data, iii) MODIS MOD10A1 NDSI snow cover data, and finally iv) in-situ snow depth data. Additionally, qualitative assessment is also performed by visually comparing MARS-H35/MODIS false-color and MARS-H35/Sentinel 2-derived reference fSCA image pairs over various geographic regions. The overall results indicate that: i) the proposed MARS-H35 fSCA product overperforms the original H35, and ii) it has higher capability in detecting the fine variations in the extent of snow cover, especially across the fringes of the slopes in complex mountainous terrains.","Multivariate adaptive regression splines,Sentinel 2,ERA5-Land,Remote sensing of the cryosphere,Fractional snow cover mapping,AVHRR,MODIS,"

"changes in the supply of eastern mediterranean glasses to visigothic spain","2019","This study presents the first comprehensive analysis of glass compositions from Visigothic Spain using high resolution laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS). Major, minor and trace element patterns of 169 well-dated samples from three rural Iberian sites (Congosto, Gózquez and El Pelícano) have brought to light major chronological developments in the production, circulation and use of glass between the fifth and the eighth century CE. The data identify four distinct compositional groups of Egyptian and Levantine origin. Egyptian Foy 2.1, Foy 2.1 high Fe and so-called Magby alongside Apollonia-type Levantine I were the main glass types of the Visigothic period. Due to the tight dating of the majority of the samples, we were able to reveal fundamental changes in the geographical scope of glass supplies to the Iberian Peninsula, and to refine the chronological range of the known primary production groups. The glass group commonly known as série 2.1 or Foy 2.1 started being produced already during the second half of the fifth century. The appearance of Foy 2.1 high Fe can likewise be moved forward to the first half of the sixth century. A plant-ash group referred to as Magby was introduced around the middle of the sixth century. Egypt was undeniably the main supplier of raw glasses to the Iberian Peninsula up to the mid-sixth century CE, after which the Levantine I group became the prime glass type among the analysed assemblages. In the final stages of the Visigothic Kingdom and the early years of Islamic dominion, there is a noticeable drop in the absolute quantity of glass available, together with an increase in recycling. The implications of these transformations in the supply of glass for the organisation of Mediterranean trade are discussed.","Levantine I,Foy 2.1,Recycling,Foy 2.1 high Fe,Magby,Foy 2.2,LA-ICP-MS,"
"producing marine geophysical archive files from raw underway data","2019","Preserving costly marine geophysical trackline data is of paramount importance but variability in priorities, funding, personnel, and technology impact our data archival capacity. We have addressed one crucial facet of this dilemma by devising an open source approach to merge and reduce underway geophysical data and to generate marine geophysical archive files using common command line programs along with the Generic Mapping Tools and its mgd77 supplement. Archive files generated using this approach retain full precision and may be converted automatically to MGD77T, MGD77+, as well as MGD77 formats. We successfully applied the approach to 340 geophysical data sets acquired by R/V Kilo Moana from 2002 to 2018 and in the near term we plan to submit the non-proprietary archive files to the National Centers for Environmental Information’s trackline geophysics archive. We encourage international oceanographic communities to explore our methodology as a larger user-base will strengthen the software and the procedures.","Data structures,Algorithms,Data processing,Marine geophysical trackline data,Data assimilation,MGD77,"
"mid-holocene cluster of large-scale landslides revealed in the southwestern alps by 36cl dating. insight on an alpine-scale landslide activity","2014","Although it is generally assumed that the internal structure of a slope (e.g. lithology and rock mass properties, inherited faults and heterogeneities, etc.) is preponderant for the progressive development of large-scale landslides, the ability to identify triggering factors responsible for final slope failures such as glacial debuttressing, seismic activities or climatic changes, especially when considering landslide cluster at an orogen-scale, is still debated. Highlighting in this study the spatial and temporal concordant clustering of deep-seated slope failures in the external Southwestern Alps, we discuss and review the possible causes for such wide-spread slope instabilities at both local and larger (Alpine) scale. High resolution field mapping coupled with electrical resistivity tomography first allows establishing an inventory of large landslides in the Southwestern Alps, determining their structural model, precising their depth limit (100–200 m) as well as the involved rock volumes (>107 m3). We show that they developed in the same geostructural context of thick mudstone layers overlain by faulted limestone and followed a block-spread model of deformation that could evolve in rock-collapse events. Cosmic ray exposure dating (CRE), using both 36Cl and 10Be in coexisting limestone and chert, respectively, has been carried out from the main scarps of six Deep Seated Landslides (DSL) and leads to landslide-failure CRE ages ranging from 3.7 to 4.7 ka. They highlighted: (i) mainly single and fast ruptures and (ii) a possible concomitant initiation with a main peak of activity between 3.3 and 5.1 ka, centered at ca 4.2 ka. Because this region was not affected by historical glaciations events, landslide triggering by glacial unloading can be excluded. The presented data combined with field observations preferentially suggest that these failures were climatically driven and were most likely controlled by high pressure changes in the karstic medium. In effect, the chronicle of failure-ages is concomitant to a well-known climatic pulse, the “4.2 ka” climate event characterized by intense hydrological perturbations associated to the heaviest rainfall period of the entire Holocene. Despite requiring further investigations and discussions, the dating of numerous events across the entire Alps during the middle Holocene period suggests a potential synchronous triggering of several large-scale gravitational-failures induced by the mid-Holocene climatic transition.","Cosmic ray exposure dating,Climate,Triggering factor,4.2 ka event,Cl,Cluster,Alps,Large landslides,"
"spectral anomaly methods for aerial detection using kut nuisance rejection","2015","This work discusses the application and optimization of a spectral anomaly method for the real-time detection of gamma radiation sources from an aerial helicopter platform. Aerial detection presents several key challenges over ground-based detection. For one, larger and more rapid background fluctuations are typical due to higher speeds, larger field of view, and geographically induced background changes. As well, the possible large altitude or stand-off distance variations cause significant steps in background count rate as well as spectral changes due to increased gamma-ray scatter with detection at higher altitudes. The work here details the adaptation and optimization of the PNNL-developed algorithm Nuisance-Rejecting Spectral Comparison Ratios for Anomaly Detection (NSCRAD), a spectral anomaly method previously developed for ground-based applications, for an aerial platform. The algorithm has been optimized for two multi-detector systems; a NaI(Tl)-detector-based system and a CsI detector array. The optimization here details the adaptation of the spectral windows for a particular set of target sources to aerial detection and the tailoring for the specific detectors. As well, the methodology and results for background rejection methods optimized for the aerial gamma-ray detection using Potassium, Uranium and Thorium (KUT) nuisance rejection are shown. Results indicate that use of a realistic KUT nuisance rejection may eliminate metric rises due to background magnitude and spectral steps encountered in aerial detection due to altitude changes and geographically induced steps such as at land–water interfaces.","Aerial detection,Radiation detection,KUT nuisance rejection,Spectral anomaly detection,Aerial search,"

"observing and understanding the southeast asian aerosol system by remote sensing: an initial review and analysis for the seven southeast asian studies (7seas) program","2013","Southeast Asia (SEA) hosts one of the most complex aerosol systems in the world, with convoluted meteorological scales, sharp geographic and socioeconomic features, high biological productivity, mixtures of a wide range of atmospheric pollutants, and likely a significant susceptibility to global climate change. This physical complexity of SEA is coupled with one of the world's most challenging environments for both in situ and remote sensing observation. The 7-Southeast Asian Studies (7SEAS) program was formed to facilitate interdisciplinary research into the integrated SEA aerosol environment via grass roots style collaboration. In support of the early 7SEAS program and the affiliated Southeast Asia Composition, Cloud, Climate Coupling Regional Study (SEAC4RS), this review was created to outline the network of connections linking aerosol particles in SEA with meteorology, climate and the total earth system. In this review, we focus on and repeatedly link back to our primary data source: satellite aerosol remote sensing and associated observability issues. We begin with a brief rationale for the program, outlining key aerosol impacts and, comparing their magnitudes to the relative uncertainty of observations. We then discuss aspects of SEA's physical, socio-economic and biological geography relevant to meteorology and observability issues associated with clouds and precipitation. We show that not only does SEA pose significant observability challenges for aerosol particles, but for clouds and precipitation as well. With the fundamentals of the environment outlined, we explore SEA's most studied aerosol issue: biomass burning. We summarize research on bulk aerosol properties for SEA, including a short synopsis of recent AERONET observations. We describe long range transport patterns. Finally, considerable attention is paid to satellite aerosol observability issues, with a face value comparison of common aerosol products in the region including passive and active aerosol products as well as fluxes. We show that satellite data products diverge greatly due to a host of known artifacts. These artifacts have important implications for how research is conducted, and care must be taken when using satellite products to study aerosol problems. The paper ends with a discussion of how the community can approach this complex and important environment.","Southeast Asia,Air Pollution,Biomass Burning,Aerosol,Meteorology,Remote Sensing,Maritime Continent,"

"keeping the baddies out and the bridge calm: embedded authentication for maritime networks","2022","Integrated bridges of todayâ€™s vessels are complex and distributed maritime systems that interconnect versatile electronic equipment. However, digitized vessels have long ceased to be isolated systems and are thus increasingly vulnerable to cyber attacks. In this context, integrity and authentication of the communication onboard is crucial. Therefore, we introduce MARMAC, a low-cost solution to retrofit authentication of nautical communication. MARMAC is based on symmetric cryptography and extends the prevalent IEC61162-450 protocol enabling a backward-compatible solution which mitigates common attacks. Using a specific gatekeeper approach, MARMAC can prevent unauthenticated messages from being processed that could otherwise affect the nautical situational awareness on the bridge.

"massive diatom bloom initiated by high winter sea ice in admiralty bay (king george island, south shetlands) in relation to nutrient concentrations in the water column during the 2009/2010 summer","2022","The South Shetland Islands, including King George Island (KGI), are located in the northern hydrographic zone on the West side of the Antarctic Peninsula (Northern WAP), which is washed mainly by the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC). Continuous vertical mixing of the water column by strong currents, violent tidal water exchanges in deep fjords and frequent strong winds do not favour the seasonal appearance of large phytoplankton blooms. In contrast, the southern WAP is bound by the continental shelf, and is under the influence of the weaker Antarctic Peninsula Coastal Current (APCC), maintaining seasonal winter sea ice, which provides a shallow mixed layer, which in turn supports high levels of biological production in summer. During the 2009 / 2010 summer, however, a distinctive bloom event (chl-a > 20 μgL−1) was documented for in Admiralty Bay (AB), the largest and deepest fjord in KGI. It commenced in early summer (29 December 2009) at the edge of melting sea ice which had persisted since the preceding cold winter of 2009. The phytoplankton group dynamics, determined using photosynthetic pigment data, and associated changes in nutrient concentration during the bloom, have been described in this paper. The area where the phytoplankton bloom developed coincided with the surface of the brash sea ice cover. The sequence and size of biological and chemical changes recorded within the fjord during the bloom resembled the recurring ice edge blooms which occur in the southern WAP, although they had a much shorter lifespan (< two weeks), which may have been due to the slow SE winds and related surface water movement direction, which hindered vertical mixing and kept the surface water within the fjord.","Nutrient dynamics,Maritime Antarctica,Antarctic fjord,HPLC pigment taxonomic group,West Antarctic peninsula,Phytoplankton bloom,"
"gatc and deepcut: deep spatiotemporal feature extraction and clustering for large-scale transportation network partition","2022","The network partition is an important method for many key transport problems, e.g., transport network zoning, parallel computing of traffic assignment problem, and analysis of the macroscopic fundamental diagram, to name a few. This paper designs two partition frameworks called GATC (Graph attention auto-encoder for clustering) and DeepCut, which can partition the transportation network into several components. These two frameworks combine unsupervised deep learning and clustering, taking into account both temporal factors and spatial factors. Firstly, the traffic flow time series data is encoded by graph attention auto-encoder, with graph structure and content considered. Secondly, the normalized cut method is used to partition the transportation network into several homogeneous sub-networks. DeepCut encodes the input data by a simple encoder, and the normalized cut method is used to partition the transportation network. The proposed methods are verified by a numerical example, which demonstrates the rationality and effectiveness of GATC and DeepCut for transportation network partition.","Auto-encoder,Transportation network partition,Graph attention,Clustering,"
"federated deep learning for smart city edge-based applications","2023","The growing quantities of data allow for advanced analysis. A prime example of it are smart city applications with forecasting urban traffic flow as a key application. However, data privacy becomes a real issue. This problem can be addressed by using federated learning trusted authority principle. In this paper, we investigate a novel federated deep learning approach to urban traffic flow forecasting that graph learning, and trusted authority mechanism. The road network is first pre-processed to eliminate the noise from the traffic data. Next, detecting anomalous features is performed to prune irrelevant edges and patterns. The generated graph is then utilized to learn a graph convolutional neural network for calculating the future city’s traffic flow. We extensive evaluate our federated learning-based framework, where a case study on predicting the future traffic flows has been carried out using multiple datasets. We examine it with different baseline techniques as well. The findings show that the suggested framework greatly outperforms the baseline methods, particularly when the graph has a lot of nodes. Importantly, our approach is the first one that integrates trusted authority principle in federated learning and, by doing so, it is able to efficiently secure model data. Moreover, the average precision of the developed model reached 84%, while the baseline solutions did not exceed 77%.","Smart city environment,Federated deep learning,Prediction traffic flows,"
"the influence of an atmospheric river on a heavy precipitation event over the western alps","2023","On 2–3 October 2020, a heavy precipitation event severely affected northern Italy and in particular the western Alps, with rainfall amount exceeding 600 mm over 24 h. This event was associated with an upper-level trough over the western Mediterranean basin, a large-scale configuration typical of heavy precipitation phenomena on the southern side of the Alps, since it induces a northward transport of large amounts of moisture impinging on the orography. The present study shows that a relevant amount of moisture moved towards the Mediterranean basin in the form of an atmospheric river (AR), a long and narrow filament-shaped structure crossing the whole Atlantic Ocean, characterized in the present case by a maximum Integrated Vapour Transport exceeding 1000 kg m−1 s−1. Therefore, in addition to the local contribution from the Mediterranean Sea, a relevant amount of moisture moved from the Tropics towards the Mediterranean, feeding the precipitation systems. The presence of an AR represented a distinguishing aspect of the event, superimposed on the well-known dynamic-thermodynamic mechanisms of heavy precipitation over the Alps. High-resolution numerical simulations and diagnostic tools have been exploited to investigate in detail how the transport of water vapour associated with the AR has influenced the dynamics and favoured the severity of the heavy precipitation processes. The results disclose the role of the AR and add further details to the theoretical framework of heavy precipitation mechanisms in the Alpine area, improving our understanding of the complex interaction between large-scale flows and mesoscale dynamics during extreme precipitation episodes. Due to the relatively fast evolution of the synoptic disturbance, the typical mesoscale mechanisms would have led only to an ordinary intense rainfall event. The contribution of the AR turned the event into a devastating flood.","Atmospheric river,Moisture transport,Mediterranean,Heavy precipitation,Orographic precipitation,"
"context-based models to overcome operational challenges in maritime security","2015","Piracy and smuggling are major international problems which not only threaten maritime security but also affect the global economy. Even though NATO and international forces have been relentlessly fighting maritime crime in East Africa (Gulf of Aden), the problems still persist and maritime crime has moved to West Africa (Gulf of Guinea). In the same vein, the Joint Interagency Task Force-South (JIATF-S) has had substantial operational success, controlling the vast geographical spread of smugglers in the East Pacific and Caribbean Sea. Due to limited number of maritime assets available, every resource needs to be efficiently allocated, both in time and space. This poses a great operational challenge requiring the integration and fusion of disparate information relevant to the mission and dynamic allocation of resources under uncertainty. Operational planning and execution for counter-smuggling and counter-piracy operations involve surveillance (to search, detect, track and identify potential threats) and interdiction operations (to intercept, investigate and potentially apprehend the suspects) in a dynamic and uncertain mission environment. In this paper, we present context-based models for counter-smuggling and counter-piracy missions, where the smuggling and piracy activities are represented in the form of color coded heat maps built using Intelligence information (INTEL), meteorological and oceanographic (METOC) information and other mission-specific attributes (sensor observations, target types and their behavior, etc.); these maps are interpreted as probability of activity (PoA) surfaces.

The algorithms used have been: Pulsed Phase Thermography (PPT), Slope, Correlation Coefficient (R2), Thermal Signal Reconstruction (TSR), Principal Component Analysis (PCT).

"societal need for improved understanding of climate change, anthropogenic impacts, and geo-hazard warning drive development of ocean observatories in european seas","2011","Society’s needs for a network of in situ ocean observing systems cross many areas of earth and marine science. Here we review the science themes that benefit from data supplied from ocean observatories. Understanding from existing studies is fragmented to the extent that it lacks the coherent long-term monitoring needed to address questions at the scales essential to understand climate change and improve geo-hazard early warning. Data sets from the deep sea are particularly rare with long-term data available from only a few locations worldwide. These science areas have impacts on societal health and well-being and our awareness of ocean function in a shifting climate. Substantial efforts are underway to realise a network of open-ocean observatories around European Seas that will operate over multiple decades. Some systems are already collecting high-resolution data from surface, water column, seafloor, and sub-seafloor sensors linked to shore by satellite or cable connection in real or near-real time, along with samples and other data collected in a delayed mode. We expect that such observatories will contribute to answering major ocean science questions including: How can monitoring of factors such as seismic activity, pore fluid chemistry and pressure, and gas hydrate stability improve seismic, slope failure, and tsunami warning? What aspects of physical oceanography, biogeochemical cycling, and ecosystems will be most sensitive to climatic and anthropogenic change? What are natural versus anthropogenic changes? Most fundamentally, how are marine processes that occur at differing scales related? The development of ocean observatories provides a substantial opportunity for ocean science to evolve in Europe. Here we also describe some basic attributes of network design. Observatory networks provide the means to coordinate and integrate the collection of standardised data capable of bridging measurement scales across a dispersed area in European Seas adding needed certainty to estimates of future oceanic conditions. Observatory data can be analysed along with other data such as those from satellites, drifting floats, autonomous underwater vehicles, model analysis, and the known distribution and abundances of marine fauna in order to address some of the questions posed above. Standardised methods for information management are also becoming established to ensure better accessibility and traceability of these data sets and ultimately to increase their use for societal benefit. The connection of ocean observatory effort into larger frameworks including the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) and the Global Monitoring of Environment and Security (GMES) is integral to its success. It is in a greater integrated framework that the full potential of the component systems will be realised.",""

It is argued that these two task analyses can form the basis for many future task analyses so that we can avoid ‘reinventing the wheel,’ allowing us to focus more on potential interesting differences between operations and geographical locations.","Task analysis,Train driving,Technology,"
"ship trajectory prediction based on machine learning and deep learning: a systematic review and methods analysis","2023","Ship trajectory prediction based on Automatic Identification System (AIS) data has attracted increasing interest as it helps prevent collision accidents and eliminate potential navigational conflicts. Therefore, it is necessary and urgent to conduct a systematic analysis of all the prediction methods to help reveal their advantages to ensure safety at sea in different scenarios. It is particularly important and significant within the context of unmanned ships forming a new hybrid maritime traffic together with manned ships in the future. This paper aims to conduct a comparative analysis of the up-to-date ship trajectory prediction algorithms based on machine learning and deep learning methods. To do so, five classical machine learning methods (i.e., Kalman Filter, Gaussian Process Regression, Support Vector Regression, Random Forest, and Back Propagation Network) and eight deep learning methods (i.e., Recurrent Neural Networks, Long Short-Term Memory, Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory, Gate Recurrent Unit, Bi-directional Gate Recurrent Unit, Sequence to Sequence, Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network, and Transformer) are thoroughly analysed and compared from the algorithm essence and applications to excavate their features and adaptability for manned and unmanned ships. The findings reveal the characteristics of various prediction methods and provide valuable implications for different stakeholders to guide the best-fit choice of a particular method as the solution under a specific circumstance. It also makes contributions to the extraction of the research difficulties of ship trajectory prediction and the corresponding solutions that are put forward to guide the development of future research.","Deep learning,Maritime safety,Hybrid maritime traffic,Trajectory prediction,AIS data,Machine learning,"
"gis-based simulation methodology for evaluating ship encounters probability to improve maritime traffic safety","2019","Evaluating ship encounters probability efficiently is significant for maritime transportation risk analysis as well as improving maritime traffic safety. In practice, ship encounters probability estimate by using traditional observation or field experiments is nearly impossible due to the expensive cost. In this paper, we propose a methodology framework for evaluating ship encounters probability based on an agent-based simulation paradigm. Individual shipâ€™s navigation behavior is modeled as an agent, and their encounters are detected by an innovative geographic information system (GIS)-based intelligent algorithm. We then design and implement a prototype simulator based on the methodology framework and apply it in the mid-western waters of Bohai Sea of China to demonstrate its functionalities and utility. The findings show that the framework proposed in this paper has potential to provide decision support for guiding future marine transportation planning. This paper offers new insights and valuable demonstration on promoting maritime traffic safety management with the integration of GIS and emerging complex system simulation technology.","decision support systems,road safety,digital simulation,Transportation,Safety,transportation,Marine vehicles,Agent-based simulation,GIS-based simulation methodology,geographic information system-based intelligent algorithm,complex system simulation technology,Bohai Sea of China,ships,marine safety,marine engineering,Accidents,maritime transportation risk analysis,geographic information systems,ship encounters probability,risk analysis,Object oriented modeling,prototype simulator,probability,decision support,maritime traffic safety,ship encounters probability evaluation,geographic information system (GIS),maritime traffic safety management,Geographic information systems,multi-agent systems,shipsâ€™ routeing planning,Analytical models,agent-based simulation paradigm,"
"geographical aodv protocol for multi-hop maritime communications","2013","Route request (RREQ) message is flooded to find a route in ad-hoc on-demand distance vector (AODV) routing protocol. This flooding of RREQ generates severe overheads in a maritime multi-hop ad-hoc network (MMANet) due to limited small bandwidth. In this paper, to improve the throughput of bandwidth-limited MMANet, we propose a geographical AODV (GAODV) protocol. The key feature of the GAODV is the selective broadcast of RREQ using position information. The routing overhead-traffic of the GAODV is smaller than that of AODV. This routing overhead-traffic reduction of the GAODV is more increased as the density of ship increases.","Satellites,routing protocols,RREQ message,marine communication,ad hoc networks,ad-hoc on-demand distance vector routing protocol,MMANet,geographical AODV protocol,route request message,maritime multihop ad-hoc network,GAODV protocol,multihop maritime communication,selective broadcast,telecommunication traffic,routing overhead-traffic reduction,AODV routing protocol,"
"green, grey and black: a comparative study of sierra de las navajas (mexico) and lipari (italy) obsidians","2018","Sierra de Las Navajas (State of Hidalgo, Mexico) and Lipari (Aeolian Islands, Italy) were among the most important sources for obsidian trade in Mesoamerica and in the Mediterranean during the Stone Age. In this paper obsidians from these two localities were compared in terms of their aspect, chemical composition, microcrystallinity and microvesiculation. In Sierra de las Navajas, the typical deep green obsidian with a golden hue has been analyzed together with a less common dark grey, porphyritic variety. Lipari obsidian is commonly black, but a light grey variety also occurs. Obsidian of both varieties was analyzed for this paper. Microvesicularity was investigated through Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) observation, microporosimetry and, for Sierra de las Navajas green obsidian, through a preliminary X-ray computed microtomographic study. Crystallinity and micro- or nano-crystallinity were investigated through X-Ray Powder Diffraction and EDS (Energy Dispersion System) microanalyses. Finally, the chemical composition in terms of major and trace elements, including rare earth elements, was determined using X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) and Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS). The comparison of samples of different colors suggests that the characteristic green color of Sierra de las Navajas obsidians could be related to their relatively high iron content, and to the occurrence of many elongated and iso-oriented vesicles which may also be responsible for the obsidian's golden hue. Low iron and an absence of vesicles give Lipari obsidian its “normal” black color. The light grey obsidian from Lipari probably owes its color and imperfect conchoidal fracture to numerous bubbles of less than 1 μm in size and to nano-crystallinity. Sierra de las Navajas obsidians show a significant chemical variability in terms of trace elements, that can be explained by common evolutionary processes in the magma chamber. However, this variability is also internal to a single volcanic complex and this makes the trace element contents unsuitable to differentiating between the different sub-sources of the same area. On Lipari, our data do not allow us to distinguish between the two sub-sources of Vallone del Gabellotto and Canneto Dentro on the basis of major and trace elements. On the whole, our study suggests that caution should be used for both Lipari and Sierra de las Navajas when identifying obsidian sub-sources on the basis of trace element contents.","Sierra de las Navajas (Mexico),XRF and ICP-MS analyses,Obsidian source analyses,Lipari (Aeolian Islands),Obsidian color,Microvesiculation,Microtexture,"

"detection and mapping of shipwrecks embedded in sea-floor sediments","2015","The paper discusses the detection of shipwrecks embedded in sea-floor sediments using a Chirp sub-bottom profiler. From a methodological-historical perspective it presents four examples of recent chirp recordings of verified shipwrecks embedded in different types of sediment environments, from different geographical and geological areas and from different periods. The effects of shallow water depths, different sediment types, recording speed and different (2D and 3D) sub-bottom profiler systems are briefly discussed. It is concluded that Chirps are well suited for survey purposes, producing high quality 2D profiles of good resolution and satisfactory penetration depth. Furthermore, the equipment is easy to handle from a small boat and allows flexible sailing. This type of 2D data is cheaper and faster to acquire and is easier to interpret and apparently also provides better resolution and detail than present 3D systems. Chirp data are therefore of great value in identifying and outlining shipwrecks hidden in the sea floor in survey situations where larger areas must be covered. The overall conclusion is that there are grounds for optimism with regard to this method of detection of maritime archaeological targets.","Subbottom seismics,Shallow water,Hard sediments,Akko,Mapping,Shipwreck,Detection,Maritime archaeology,"
"glacial conditioning of stream position and flooding in the braid plain of the exit glacier foreland, alaska","2017","Flow spilling out of an active braid plain often signals the onset of channel migration or avulsion to previously occupied areas. In a recently deglaciated environment, distinguishing between shifts in active braid plain location, considered reversible by fluvial processes at short timescales, and more permanent glacier-conditioned changes in stream position can be critical to understanding flood hazards. Between 2009 and 2014, increased spilling from the Exit Creek braid plain in Kenai Fjords National Park, Alaska, repeatedly overtopped the only access road to the popular Exit Glacier visitor facilities and trails. To understand the likely cause of road flooding, we consider recent processes and the interplay between glacier and fluvial system dynamics since the maximum advance of the Little Ice Age, around 1815. Patterns of temperature and precipitation, the variables that drive high streamflow via snowmelt, glacier meltwater runoff, and rainfall, could not fully explain the timing of road floods. Comparison of high-resolution topographic data between 2008 and 2012 showed a strong pattern of braid plain aggradation along 3km of glacier foreland, not unexpected at the base of mountainous glaciers and likely an impetus for channel migration. Historically, a dynamic zone follows the retreating glacier in which channel positions shift rapidly in response to changes in the glacier margin and fresh morainal deposits. This period of paraglacial adjustment lasts one to several decades at Exit Glacier. Subsequently, as moraine breaches consolidate and lock the channel into position, and as the stream regains the lower-elevation valley center, upper-elevation surfaces are abandoned as terraces inaccessible by fluvial processes for timescales of decades to centuries. Where not constrained by these terraces and moraines, the channel is free to migrate, which in this aggradational setting generates an alluvial fan at the breach of the final prominent moraine. The position of this fan is glacially conditioned but the process of migration of the braided channels across it is not. This broad perspective on channel controls identifies incipient avulsion into the roadside forest as part of a long-term fan-building process independent from changes in streamflow or sediment load.","Braid plains,Flooding,Channel migration,Deglaciation,Alluvial fans,Exit Glacier,"
"surge-tectonic evolution of southeastern asia: a geohydrodynamics approach","1995","The repeated need for ad hoc modifications in plate-tectonic models to explain the evolution of southeastern Asia reveals their inability to fully explain the complex features and dynamics of this region. As one example, the hypothesis does not provide a mechanism to explain the 180° turns and twists along the strike of several foldbelts and island arcs in the region (e.g. Banda arc). Convection-cell configuration renders such 180° contortions and Rayleigh-Bénard-type convection impossible. However, during the last 10 years, new data bearing on the convection-cell problem have become available in the form of seismotomographic images of the earth's interior. These images show that (i) mantle diapirs as proposed by traditional plate-tectonic models do not exist; (ii) there is no discernible pattern of upper or lower mantle convection, and thus no longer an adequate mechanism to move plates; and (iii) the lithosphere above a depth of about 80 km is permeated by an interconnected network of low-velocity channels. Seismic-reflection studies of the low-velocity channels discovered on the seismotomographic images reveal that these channels have walls with a 7.1–7.8 km s−1 P-wave velocity. Commonly, the interiors of the channels are acoustically transparent, with much slower P-wave velocities, in places as low as 5.4 km s−1. The author and co-workers have interpreted the low velocities as evidence for the presence of partial melt in the channels, and they postulated that this melt moves preferentially eastward as a result of the earth's rotation. They named these channels “surge channels” and their new hypothesis for earth dynamics “surge tectonics”. Surge channels underlie every type of tectonic belt, which includes mid-ocean ridges, aseismic ridges, continental rifts, strike-slip fracture zones, and foldbelts. In southeastern Asia, surge channels—mainly foldbelts—lie between all platform and cratonic massifs. These massifs, platforms, and tectonics belts—the surge channels—form an anastomosing E-W pattern southern Asiatic Russia, Mongolia, western China, the Qinghai-Tibetan region, and northern India and Pakistan. Such an anastomosing pattern indicates that flow is an active process in the surge channels. Surface studies of phenomena that might be associated with the surge channels soon revealed that all active channels are characterized by higher-than-normal heat flow (> 55 mW m−2, thermal springs and elevated ground-water temperatures, volvanic phenomena, bands of microearthquakes, and linear belts of faults, fractures, and fissures. The latter are especially visible on satellite images. The bands of high heat flow, thermal springs, microearthquakes, and faults-fractures-fissures almost exactly coincide. The fault-fracture-fissure systems are interpreted to be streamlines caused by flow in the surge channels—a consequence of Stokes's Law (an expression of Newton's Second Law of Motion)-and show that Poiseuille flow must dominate in the channels. Hence, the mechanism producing the belts of linear faults-fractures-fissures is viscous drag, produced by fluid motions. The eastward flow of the magma in the channels is demonstrated clearly in the tectonic patterns of southeastern Asia. In the northern part of the region studied, the E-W striking anastomosing surge channels (tectonic belts) splay northeastward into the coastal regions of Russia. In the south, they splay southward and southeastward through the Malay Peninsula and Indonesia. The open horsetail structures thus created prove that flow is W-E. The presence of the two splay directions, NE and S-SE, indicates in addition that a barrier to eastward flow must lie directly east of Asia. In this author's opinion, this barrier is the existing Benioff zone, because the same NE and S-SE splay patterns are present on each of the paleotectonic maps that have been prepared for nine time intervals from the beginning of Sinian (latest Proterozoic) time to the present. The presence of the W-E flow patterns through 850 Ma of geological time, patterns that remain essentially unchanged, means simply that tectonic explanations of Asian geology need revision. The patterns that have been mapped indicate that W-E flow across Asia has persisted essentially unchanged for 850 Ma. Surge tectonics is the only hypothesis yet proposed that explains these patterns and their persistence.",""
"providing engineering support to advance maritime research through successful at-sea experimentations: 60 yearsâ€™ experience in cmre facing evolving complex challenges and providing efficient solutions. a practical example","2019","Providing state-of-the-art, at-sea engineering capability to advance maritime research has been for 60 years a day-to-day mission for the NATO Centre for Maritime Research and Experimentation (CMRE). Along those years, CMRE has been demonstrating its excellence in such endeavor, gaining worldwide recognition and awards. Numerous scientific and technology breakthrough were achieved, that were carefully transitioned and are now in use within the NATO Navies. While at-sea experimentation remains a fundamental stage to validate and advance research in the maritime domain, well performing during maritime operations is not a chance, requiring extensive experience, and expertise in multiple complementary domains.

"contaminants in two west greenland caribou populations","2016","Two caribou populations in West Greenland were sampled and the kidneys, liver and muscle analyzed for contaminants, including aluminum, arsenic, cadmium, copper, lead, mercury, selenium and zinc. Although close in proximity, the two populations are topographically separated by an ice cap, which creates different climates and vegetation types in each region. Contaminant levels reflected the differing diets of the two caribou populations. To the south in the wetter lichen-rich region, caribou had significantly more aluminum, arsenic, cadmium, lead, mercury, selenium and zinc, likely due to atmospheric deposition on lichens. To the north in the dry desert steppe where grasses predominate, caribou had higher levels of copper. Cows collected in late winter had significantly less hepatic copper, lead and mercury if pregnant, indicating placental transfer of these elements. Our results suggest that hepatic copper levels <200μgg−1 dry weight may result in copper depletion in pregnant cows and hepatic mercury concentrations above 0.5μgg−1 dry weight may negatively affect fertility in caribou cows. Hepatic mercury levels were negatively correlated with cow body weight, suggesting an adverse effect on body condition. Element concentrations found in tissues from these caribou are not considered to be of a health concern for those consuming this traditional food.","Copper,Lead,Selenium,Mercury,Cadmium,Caribou,"

"a novel approach to automate surrounding ships in a virtual maritime environment","2014","Full mission marine training scenarios are essential in training marine trainees with ship handling simulators. In a good training simulation not only the static environment but also the dynamic surrounding ships plays a major role in terms of behaviour realism. The surrounding ships also need to navigate according to COLREG (Convention on International Regulation for Preventing Collisions at Sea) navigational rules. This research presents a novel approach to automate the surrounding vessels in a marine simulation environment with a central controller to control the behaviours of each surrounding vessel in the marine environment. The controller uses positioning data of real ships which are derived from a set of historical Automatic Identification System (AIS) data and map the positioning data with the surrounding ships in virtual environment to obtain the navigation. An Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm is used to avoid the collisions by generating a new path when both trainee's ship and surrounding ships are in the vicinity of each other. The collision handling mechanism uses COLREG rules. The ACO algorithm generates successful collision avoided paths in all head-on, crossing and over-taking encountering situations. The number of turning points is used to measure the smoothness of the path and number of obstacles in the environment and number of nodes in the graph affects the smoothness of the path. With these results it is revealed that AIS data can be used as an assistant to automate surrounding vessels in a virtual maritime environment together with a proper collision avoidance mechanism.","head-on situations,collision handling mechanism,virtual maritime environment,ACO algorithm,crossing situations,virtual reality,ant colony optimization,target ships,ant colony optimisation,over-taking encountering situations,surrounding ships automation,marine navigation,Radio frequency,surrounding ships,ship handling simulators,ships,Automatic Identification System,AIS,surrounding vessels,Convention on International Regulation for Preventing Collisions at Sea,central controller,marine simulation environment,collision avoidance,Ant Colony Optimization (ACO),autonomous navigation,historical AIS data,COLREG navigational rules,"

Most studies applied satellite information to address marine litter using multi- and hyper- spectral optical sensors. The correspondence analysis on analyzed variables exhibited that aircrafts with high spatial resolution (<3 m) with optical sensors (λ = 400 to 2500 nm) seem to be the most optimum combination to target marine litter, while satellites carrying Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensors (λ = 3.1 to 5.6 cm) may detect sea-slicks associated to surfactants that might contain high concentration of microplastics.

"role of rainfall intensity and urban sprawl in the 2014 flash flood in genoa city, bisagno catchment (liguria, italy)","2018","Flash floods are typical for the Mediterranean region, however they have been recurring at increasing frequency over the past few decades especially over the Italian Peninsula. The region of Genoa has recently moved into the international spotlight due to frequent and disastrous flash floods of the Bisagno River and its tributaries as a result of intense autumn rainfall and dense floodplain urbanization. The last flood events even caused loss in human lives, with 6 casualties in 2011 and 1 in 2014. However, it has not yet been investigated whether the increase in these flash flood events is due to a change in rainfall regime or due to urban expansion in areas prone to flash floods. This study investigates the meteorological conditions and the ground effects of the Bisagno River flash flood of October 9th, 2014 in the city of Genoa. Application of a Standard Anomaly Index and a Cluster Analysis reveals a positive trend in intense and short-duration rainfall recorded in the Bisagno Valley for the period of 1945–2016. Urban sprawl in the catchment, assessed through a multi-temporal cartographic and photographic comparison, highlights the progressive and total consumption of land in the floodplain. In the river basin surrounding Genoa the risk of flash floods has increased, both due to a change in rainfall regime and associated increase in discharge but also due to increased vulnerability caused by progressive urban expansion and land use change, including in particular transformations of the Bisagno riverbed. The results obtained demonstrate the need for urgent action to mitigate flood risk by introducing, amongst other measures, a citizen observatory for early warning of flash floods.","Urban sprawl,Italy,Flash flood risk,Rainfall regime variations,Mediterranean area,Genoa,"

"geochemical characteristics of gold-related granitoids in southwestern new brunswick, canada","2008","Two groups of granitoids associated with gold mineralization in the Appalachian orogen of southwestern New Brunswick are recognized: a Late Silurian to Early Devonian (423–396 Ma) granodioritic to monzogranitic series (GMS), and a Late Devonian (370–360 Ma) granitic series (GS). The GMS granitoids are relatively low in silica, calc-alkaline, metaluminous to weakly peraluminous, and show characteristics of normal (oxidized) to reduced I-type granites depending on the properties of country rocks. They may have been derived from partial melting of lower crustal rocks triggered by underplated basaltic magmas; and country rocks bearing reduced organic carbon and/or graphite may have played an important role in the reduction of normal I-type intrusions to reduced I-type, which is essential in the formation of intrusion-related gold systems. In contrast, the GS granites, although calc-alkaline and metaluminous to peraluminous, are relatively rich in silica, incompatible elements, and high field strength elements. They are fractionated I-type granites, and are probably related to the coeval Mount Douglas granite in the Saint George batholith through fractional crystallization. Their parental magmas may have been derived from partial melting of quartzofeldspathic sources at relatively low temperatures. Both GMS and GS intrusions are orogenic, although some of them display the affinity of those emplaced into a within-plate environment. The origin of intrusion-related gold systems in this region appears to be controlled by several factors, including magma sources, magmatic processes, redox conditions (country-rock nature), and local structural regimes.","Appalachians,New Brunswick,Granitoid,Intrusion-related gold system,I-type granites,Geochemistry,"
"global wood anatomical perspective on the onset of the late antique little ice age (lalia) in the mid-6th century ce","2022","Linked to major volcanic eruptions around 536 and 540 CE, the onset of the Late Antique Little Ice Age has been described as the coldest period of the past two millennia. The exact timing and spatial extent of this exceptional cold phase are, however, still under debate because of the limited resolution and geographical distribution of the available proxy archives. Here, we use 106 wood anatomical thin sections from 23 forest sites and 20 tree species in both hemispheres to search for cell-level fingerprints of ephemeral summer cooling between 530 and 550 CE. After cross-dating and double-staining, we identified 89 Blue Rings (lack of cell wall lignification), nine Frost Rings (cell deformation and collapse), and 93 Light Rings (reduced cell wall thickening) in the Northern Hemisphere. Our network reveals evidence for the strongest temperature depression between mid-July and early-August 536 CE across North America and Eurasia, whereas more localised cold spells occurred in the summers of 532, 540–43, and 548 CE. The lack of anatomical signatures in the austral trees suggests limited incursion of stratospheric volcanic aerosol into the Southern Hemisphere extra-tropics, that any forcing was mitigated by atmosphere-ocean dynamical responses and/or concentrated outside the growing season, or a combination of factors. Our findings demonstrate the advantage of wood anatomical investigations over traditional dendrochronological measurements, provide a benchmark for Earth system models, support cross-disciplinary studies into the entanglements of climate and history, and question the relevance of global climate averages.","Climate extremes,Volcanic eruptions,Late Antiquity,Dendrochronology,Tree rings,Blue Rings,"

Although this topic has been extensively researched, the navigational situation of vessels has received little attention. However, such a navigational situation is essential for understanding water bodies and ensuring maritime safety. To provide effective navigation information, this study first analyzes the actual situation of vessel traffic using Automatic Identification System (AIS) data. Operators can be based on the analysis to understand the trend of navigation ships in water bodies as an important reference. From the results of the analysis, we constructed a representable navigational information system. Different information was unified on a Geographical Information System (GIS) in two-and three-dimensional formats. The system was demonstrated in a navigation simulation of a real voyage ship in Osaka Bay, Japan. The integrated information can be comprehensively and realistically interpreted by operators. Therefore, the system is expected to effectively avoid maritime disaster.","marine accidents,voyage ship,3D GIS,Maritime traffic,Safety,navigation information presentation,Marine vehicles,marine navigation,data visualisation,effective navigation information,Automatic Identification System data,vessel traffic,Japan,Voyage simulation,maritime disaster prevention,marine safety,Oceans,Educational institutions,Maritime disaster,geographic information systems,3D-GIS data,Osaka Bay,Navigation,Information systems,navigation information communication,marine control,Geographic information systems,AIS data,Geographical Information System,maritime safety,"
"principal component thermography for flaw contrast enhancement and flaw depth characterisation in composite structures","2002","This study reports on the application of principal component thermography to the nondestructive inspection of composite structures. The technique is based on a singular value decomposition of the measured response to pulsed thermal excitation as applied in the course of a normal flash thermographic inspection. Trials on synthetically generated data show evidence of excellent noise-rejection qualities which manifest high levels of flaw contrast relative to that present in the unprocessed data. A simple analytical expression is then derived that relates a characteristic time furnished by the decomposition to the flaw depth, providing a basis for flaw depth estimation. This framework is shown to provide flaw-depth estimates with good levels of precision and robustness. Finally, application to experimental data is considered. An AS4/3501 composite laminate sample containing an assortment of teflon inserts is subject to active thermographic inspection and the response data analysed using the proposed approach. The results conclusively demonstrate the practical efficacy of the approach, and confirm the attractive properties outlined in relation to the numerical tests.",""
"primary and secondary tip coronae from splashing water drops in electric fields","2012","An enquiry has been carried out into millimetre size water drops falling through vertical electric fields, at terminal and near terminal velocities, and impacting a water surface. A laboratory method was devised to electronically observe the splashing event, together with the onset, duration and magnitude of all ensuing coronae. The production of a secondary jet tip and the discovery of a previously unknown corona were originally recorded by Kinsey (1986) and are here described in detail. Emanating from the secondary jet tip, the corona is synonymous with the release and electrification of an airborne water drop and its nC range of charge transfer (being field/momentum dependant) offer low level luminosity to the dark adapted eye (mentioned by ur Rahman and Saunders, 1988). For terminal and near terminal velocity drops, the resulting water jets follow under-damped sinusoidal oscillation and, in fields above a critical value (Ec), their primary tips often support more than one corona, thus yielding charge to the aerosol and space charge below oceanic thunderstorms. Secondary tip, or jet drop, corona data show the phenomenon to occur in fields of 100Vcm−1 and maybe even lower. The role of such drops, in oceanic thunderstorm electrification, being subject to drop size, ambient field, updraft and wind shear speeds. Oscilloscopic and photographic evidence is presented in support of the discovered corona and oscillographs, photographs and data are taken from P. B.

"mining vessel tracking data for maritime domain applications","2016","The growing number of remote sensing systems and ship reporting technologies (e.g. Automatic Identification System, Long Range Identification and Tracking, radar tracking, Earth Observation) are generating an overwhelming amount of spatio-temporal and geographically distributed data related to vessels and their movements. Research on reliable data mining techniques has proven essential to the discovery of knowledge from such increasingly available information on ship traffic at sea. Data driven knowledge discovery has very recently demonstrated its value in fields that go beyond the original maritime safety and security remits of such data. They include, but are not limited to, fisheries management, maritime spatial planning, gridding ship emissions, mapping activities at sea, risk assessment of offshore platforms, and trade indicators. The extraction of useful information from maritime Big Data is thus a key element in providing operational authorities, policy-makers and scientists with supporting tools to understand what is happening at sea and improve maritime knowledge. This work will provide a survey of the recent JRC research activities relevant to automatic anomaly detection and knowledge discovery in the maritime domain. Data mining, data analytics and predictive analysis examples are introduced using real data. In addition, this paper presents approaches to detect anomalies in reporting messages and unexpected behaviours at sea.","maritime spatial planning,gridding ship emissions,data mining,mining,remote sensing,fishery management,Ports (Computers),trade indicators,anomaly detection,vessel tracking data mining,geographically distributed data,Marine vehicles,security of data,maritime security,data analysis,offshore platforms,ships,Maritime Domain Awareness,spatio-temporal data,Knowledge discovery,marine engineering,ship reporting technologies,Maritime Surveillance,AIS,data analytics,Data Mining,maritime domain applications,predictive analysis,Radar tracking,maritime knowledge,JRC research activities,Big Data,sea ship traffic,risk assessment,maritime Big Data,data driven knowledge discovery,Data mining,Security,knowledge discovery,remote sensing systems,tracking,maritime safety,"
"geographical differences in seasonality of czcs-derived phytoplankton pigment in the arabian sea for 1978–1986","2000","In situ measurements of phytoplankton chlorophyll in the Arabian Sea were taken largely along temporally and spatially unevenly distributed sections, scarce especially prior to the operation of NASA's Coastal Zone Color Scanner (CZCS). Herein, the CZCS pigment observations between late 1978 and mid-1986 north of 10°N, including the outer Gulf of Oman, are depicted for 14 subregions beyond the continental shelves as daily means, often only five days apart. To eliminate bias from electronic overshoot, the data were reprocessed with a more conservative cloud screen than used for NASA's Global Data Set. The pattern, derived from the older in situ observations, of one period with elevated chlorophyll almost everywhere during the Southwest Monsoon (SWM) and one additional late-winter bloom in the north, is confirmed. The differing nitrate silicate ratios in freshly entrained water in the central and northern Arabian Sea seem to lead to different succession and perhaps to differing vertical fluxes, and during winter favor blooms only in the north. The spatial pigment pattern in the outer Gulf of Oman is not an extension of that of the northwestern Arabian Sea. The seasonal physical forcing explains much of the timing of pigment concentration changes, but not the levels maintained over long periods. From the CZCS observations it is unclear whether the period of high phytoplankton productivity expected during the SWM in the open Arabian Sea lasts for about two or four months. During this entire season, chlorophyll values in the upper layers rarely exceed 1–2mgm−3 outside the zone influenced by the Arabian upwelling. Near 15°N, however, fluxes into sediment traps at 3km depth indicate an onset of high primary production very soon after the arrival of the SWM and suggest a long period of high production in the open sea. The partial temporal disconnect during the SWM between pigment changes in the upper part of the euphotic zone and of fluxes into the traps is disconcerting. For future modeling of plankton production in the open Arabian Sea, the use of two size classes of phytoplankton is recommended. The utility of satellite-derived pigment concentrations (as opposed to temporal changes of pigment) for testing such models is questioned.",""

"an integrated dynamic ship risk model based on bayesian networks and evidential reasoning","2021","The paper proposes a probabilistic framework for assessing the risk of ships based on a hybrid approach and multiple data sources. A Bayes-based network learning approach uses data from the New Inspection Regime of the Paris MoU on Port State Control to characterise the relationships among risk parameters and uses these parameters to evaluate the ship static risk. Other data sources are used to develop a Bayesian Network model to assess the dynamic risk of the ship. The data is aggregated by Bayesian Network and Evidential Reasoning approaches to evaluate the overall risk of ships in coastal waters. The objective of the study is to develop a model to assess the risk of an individual ship by considering its static risk profile and the geographical-dependant risk factors related to the characteristics of the maritime traffic flow and other local characteristics that influence the navigational risk of the ship. The results show that the integrated approach is able to assess the overall risk of a ship based on multiple data sources, providing empirical evidence of using multiple data sources in risk analysis applications. Moreover, the developed model identifies the most critical circumstances and the key impact factors in the study waters, which can support decisions on risk prevention and mitigation measures and local maritime traffic management.","Evidential Reasoning,Rule-based approach,Static and dynamic ship risk,Bayesian Networks,Automatic identification system data,Port State Control inspection data,Maritime risk analysis,"
"combining ground-based and remotely sensed snow data in a linear regression model for real-time estimation of snow water equivalent","2022","Effective water resources management in California relies substantially on real-time information of snow water equivalent (SWE) at basin scale and mountain ranges given that mountain snowpacks provide the primary water supply for the State. However, SWE estimation based solely on remote sensing, modeling, or ground observations does not meet contemporary operational requirements. In this context, this study develops a data-fusion framework that combines multi-source datasets including satellite-observed daily mean fractional snow-covered area (DMFSCA), snow pillow SWE measurements, physiographic data, and historical SWE patterns into a linear regression model (LRM) to improve SWE estimates in real-time. We test two LRMs: a baseline regression model (LRM-baseline) that uses physiographic data and historical SWE patterns as independent variables, and an FSCA-informed regression model (LRM-FSCA) that includes the DMFSCA from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite imagery as an additional independent variable. By incorporating the satellite-observed DMFSCA, LRM-FSCA outperforms LRM-baseline with increased median R2 from 0.54 to 0.60, and reduced median PBIAS of basin average SWE from 2.6% to 2.2% in the snow pillow SWE cross-validation. LRM-FSCA explains 87% of the variance in the snow course SWE measurements with 0.1% PBIAS, while LRM-baseline explains a lower 81% variance with 1.4% PBIAS, both of which show higher accuracy than SWE estimates from the two operational SWE datasets: the Snow Data Assimilation System (SNODAS, 73% and -2.4%, respectively) and Nationtional Water Model (NWM, 75% and -15.9%, respectively). Additionally, LRM-FSCA explains 85% of the median variance in the Airborne Snow Observatory SWE with -9.2% PBIAS, which is comparable to the LRM-baseline (86% and -11.3%, respectively) and considerably better than SNODAS (64% and 28.2%, respectively) and NWM (33% and -30.1%, respectively). This study shows a substantial model improvement by constraining the geographical and seasonal variation on snow-cover via satellite observation and highlights the values of using multi-source observations in real-time SWE estimation. The developed SWE estimation framework has crucial implications for effective water supply forecasting and management in California, where climate extremes (e.g., droughts and floods) require particularly skillful monitoring practices.","Statistical-learning,Remote Sensing,Snow water equivalent,Snow-covered area,Sierra Nevada snowpack,Real-time SWE modeling,"

"smoke aerosol transport patterns over the maritime continent","2013","Smoke transport patterns over the Maritime Continent (MC) are studied through a combination of approaches, including a) analyzing AODs obtained from satellite products; b) aerosol transport modeling with AOD assimilation along with the atmospheric flow patterns; c) analyzing smoke wet deposition distributions; and d) examining forward trajectories for smoke events defined in this study. It is shown that smoke transport pathways are closely related to the low-level atmospheric flow, i.e., during June–Sept, smoke originating from the MC islands with a dominant source over central and southern Sumatra, and southern and western Borneo, is generally transported northwestward south of the equator and northeastward north of the equator with the cross-equatorial flow, to the South China Sea (SCS), the Philippines and even further to the western Pacific. During the October–November transitional period, smoke transport paths are more zonally oriented compared to June–September. Smoke originating from Java, Bali, Timor etc, and southern New Guinea, which are in the domain of easterlies and southeasterlies during the boreal summer (June–November), is generally transported westward. It is also found that smoke transport over the MC exhibits multi-scale variability. Smoke typically lives longer and can be transported farther in El Niño years and later MJO phases compared with non El Niño years and earlier MJO phases. During El Niño periods there is much stronger westward transport to the east tropical Indian Ocean. Finally, orographic effect on smoke transport over the MC is also clearly discernable.","Aerosol transport,Smoke,El Niño,MJO,Smoke transport,Maritime Continent,"
"spatio-temporal analysis of lightning activity over greece — preliminary results derived from the recent state precision lightning network","2014","Lightning is a natural phenomenon in the atmosphere, being a major cause of storm related deaths, main trigger of forest fires and affects many electrochemical systems of the body. Significant scientific interest has come up in the last decades, as numerous lightning detection networks have been established in operational basis, providing lightning data to assess and mitigate lightning impact to the local society by spatio-temporal analysis. In this study, a preliminary analysis of spatial and temporal variabilities of recorded lightnings over Greece during the period from January 2008 to December 2009 is presented. The data for retrieving the location and time-of-occurrence (TOA) of lightning were acquired from the Hellenic National Meteorological Service (HNMS). An operational precision lightning network (PLN) has been established since 2007 by HNMS, consisting of eight time-of-arrival (TOA) sensors, spatially distributed across Greek territory. The spatial variability of lightnings revealed their incidence within specific geographical sub-regions while the temporal variability concerns the seasonal and monthly distributions. All the analyses were carried out with respect to cloud to cloud (CC), cloud to ground (CG) and ground to cloud (GC) lightnings, within the examined time period. During the autumn season, lightning activity was the highest, followed by summer and spring. Higher frequencies of stokes appear over Ionian Sea and Aegean Sea than over land during winter period against continental mountainous regions during summer period.","Cloud-to-cloud lightning,Hellenic National Meteorological Service,Operational precision lightning network,Ground-to-cloud lightning,Cloud-to-ground lightning,"
"4-dimensional virtual aids to navigation for arctic maritime transits","2017","Vast expanses of the Arctic are opening to exploration, natural resource acquisition and even tourism as the sea ice recedes.

Few, if any hydrographic surveys to modern standards have been performed in these areas other than along this specific route that was recently surveyed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Due to the large geographic areas involved and a lack of national assets, aids to navigation in the form of buoys, lights and other physical aids do not exist.

Then, surveillance tasks should be scheduled onto successive periods. The problem is designed to consider two conflicting objective functions: minimizing the makespan and minimizing the total cost.

"low-head pumped hydro storage: a review of applicable technologies for design, grid integration, control and modelling","2022","To counteract a potential reduction in grid stability caused by a rapidly growing share of intermittent renewable energy sources within our electrical grids, large scale deployment of energy storage will become indispensable. Pumped hydro storage is widely regarded as the most cost-effective option for this. However, its application is traditionally limited to certain topographic features. Expanding its operating range to low-head scenarios could unlock the potential of widespread deployment in regions where so far it has not yet been feasible. This review aims at giving a multi-disciplinary insight on technologies that are applicable for low-head (2-30 m) pumped hydro storage, in terms of design, grid integration, control, and modelling. A general overview and the historical development of pumped hydro storage are presented and trends for further innovation and a shift towards application in low-head scenarios are identified. Key drivers for future deployment and the technological and economic challenges to do so are discussed. Based on these challenges, technologies in the field of pumped hydro storage are reviewed and specifically analysed regarding their fitness for low-head application. This is done for pump and turbine design and configuration, electric machines and control, as well as modelling. Further aspects regarding grid integration are discussed. Among conventional machines, it is found that, for high-flow low-head application, axial flow pump-turbines with variable speed drives are the most suitable. Machines such as Archimedes screws, counter-rotating and rotary positive displacement reversible pump-turbines have potential to emerge as innovative solutions. Coupled axial flux permanent magnet synchronous motor-generators are the most promising electric machines. To ensure grid stability, grid-forming control alongside bulk energy storage with capabilities of providing synthetic inertia next to other ancillary services are required.","Reversible pump-turbine,Energy storage,Grid stability,Low-head pumped hydro storage,Renewables integration,Energy transition,"
"detection of diffusion and contact zones of early farming in europe from the space-time distribution of 14c dates","2009","The spread of early farming in Europe is revisited using a sample of 3072 audited 14C calBC dates from 940 georeferenced early Neolithic sites. The surface expansion of early Neolithic has been reconstituted using the kriging technique of spatial interpolation. Centres of renewed expansion, of contact zones, and the main routes of expansion have been highlighted by means of a vector map, representing the gradient. The expansion of the agricultural system on the map, was not uniform and regular across Europe as a whole, but proceeded in leaps. With the scale of detection of the 500-year isochrones, several leaps are identifiable: at 8000 calBC crossing the Taurus barrier, 6700–6100 calBC crossing the southern Adriatic barrier, 6100–5600 calBC crossing the Central European agro-ecological barrier and 5000–4000 calBC expanding on the other, marginal zones. Using a vector map, 10 points of renewed expansion and nine contact zones, were detected. The whole does not correspond to a process of homogeneous diffusion, approximately steady, but a process marked by phases of geographical expansion and stasis.","Early Neolithic Europe,14C dates,Arrhythmic model,Expansion of early farming,Renewed expansion,Contact zones,Vector map,"
"enterprise resilience and sustainability for operations of maritime container ports","2019","Recent trends in markets, technologies, demographics, regulations, organizations, energy, and environments require adaptations for operations of container ports. This paper describes resilience of ports to emergent conditions in three areas: Energy and fuels, controls and automation, and logistics transformation. First, the sustainability of energy and fuels have become a priority for ports due to growing concerns of carbon emissions. Liquified natural gas (LNG) is both a cost-effective and safe alternative fuel for reducing emissions of container ships. The feasibility and several strategies for adopting LNG bunkering at ports are described. Second, ports must leverage technological development to drive greater efficiency and operative resiliency. Recent developments in industrial automation and electrification are described. Lastly, the impact of corporate development to the region of the port is discussed. An analysis of enterprise capacity expansion includes both risks and benefits to increase competitiveness. This paper uses methodology of systems and data analysis, mathematical simulation, and risk cost-benefit optimization.

"seasonal oceanographic changes and their implications for the abundance of small pelagic fishes in the southern south china sea","2022","The seasonal variations in shelf circulation and their implications for the distribution of light fishing vessels positions (VBD) that capture small pelagic fishes in the southern South China Sea (SSCS) are investigated by using multi-datasets between 2008–2014. It is found that the SSCS shelf circulation is indicated by the strong seasonal reversal western boundary current (WBC) and prominent cyclonic circulation (eddy). The southeastward WBC brings homogeneous salty, colder, and high primary production of nanophytoplankton (PPN) water during winter-time from the northern and the cyclonic eddy region into the southern SSCS. In contrast, less salty, warmer, and less PPN are advected northwestward from Karimata into the northern region. These factors significantly influence the distribution of VBD and in turn the production of captured small pelagic fishes (CPUE), revealing two maxima (peaks) of both VBD and CPUE during the monsoon breaks (MB) with a time-lag of 2–3 month from the monsoon peaks. Relationship between oceanographic parameters and CPUE is examined statistically revealing that ocean current and PPN are significantly affect the CPUE. A relatively high PPN and strong current during the peaks of monsoon are correlated with lower CPUE. In contrast, during the MBs period CPUE maxima are associated with a relatively weak ocean current and consumed PPN that favor the abundance of small pelagic fishes.","Small pelagic fishes,Southern South China Sea,Light fishing vessels,Oceanographic parameters,"

"the impact of circulation and dust deposition in controlling the distributions of dissolved fe and al in the south indian subtropical gyre","2015","The South Indian Subtropical Gyre (SISG) is one of the least studied gyre systems of the world ocean with respect to trace elements. Here we report dissolved (<0.45μm) Fe and Al measurements collected during two high-resolution US-CLIVAR CO2 Repeat Hydrography sections, which transected the upper 1000m of the gyre zonally along ~32°S (I05) and meridionally along ~30°E (I06S). Particulate Fe and Al concentrations in waters influenced by the Agulhas Current are also presented. The distributions of dissolved Fe and Al in the gyre are primarily impacted by mineral dust deposition at the surface and the large-scale circulation patterns of the gyre at depth. Using mean mixed layer dissolved Al concentrations, we estimate that the deposition and partial dissolution of mineral dust emanating from South Africa and Australia vary from 60 to 685mg (dust) m−2yr−1 across the 32°S transect. This translates into a dust source of dissolved Fe ranging from 1.7 to 20μmolFem−2y−1. The zonal patterns of aeolian deposition and those of N*, an indirect geochemical tracer for nitrogen fixation, show remarkable similarities along the I05 transect, suggesting that aeolian delivery of Fe may regulate nitrogen fixation rates in the SISG. In the western SISG (west of 60°E), which receives some of the highest aeolian Fe fluxes of the 32°S section, the Fe:AOU ratio in Indian Central Water was elevated relative to that observed in the Indian Central Water occupying the eastern Indian Ocean. These elevated Fe:AOU ratios may reflect the remineralization of Fe-rich organic material from nitrogen fixing organisms at the western end of the basin. Below the mixed layer, the distribution of dissolved Al appears to trace the principal features of the large-scale circulation of the SISG. Elevated subsurface concentrations of dissolved Al (>4nM) in the southwest Indian Ocean west of 45–50°E are most likely sustained by leakage of Al-rich waters from the Agulhas Return Current. Along the southeast African margin, the elevated particulate Fe (up to 230nM) and Al (up to 690nM) concentrations reflect the resuspension and transport of shelf sediments by the highly energetic Agulhas Current. However, while the particulate inputs at the margin are massive and appear to supply modest amounts of dissolved Fe, the distribution of dissolved Al is decoupled from the particulate phase. This observation suggests that the elevated subsurface dissolved Al concentrations observed near the African shelf are not the result of sediment resuspension processes occurring in situ along I05 but are more likely an advected signal originating from the upper reaches of the Agulhas Current.","CLIVAR,Al aluminium,Fe iron,Indian Ocean,"
"butyltin compounds in a sediment core from the old tilbury basin, london, uk","2005","Sections from a sediment core taken from the River Thames were analysed for butyltin species using gas chromatography with species-specific isotope dilution mass spectrometry. Results demonstrated that in most samples tributyltin concentrations of 20–60ng/g accounted for <10% of the total butyltin species present, which is in agreement with data from other sediment samples which were historically contaminated with tributyltin. Vertical distribution of the organotin residues with depth throughout the core, with data on organochlorine compounds and heavy metals allowed for the construction of a consistent hypothesis on historical deposition of contaminated sediments. From this it was possible to infer that the concentrations of tributyltin in sediments deposited during the early 1960s were in the order of 400–600μg/g by using degradation rate constants derived by other workers. Such values fall well within the range quoted for harbour sediments in the literature.","Antifoulant,Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry,Tributyltin,Gas chromatography,Isotope dilution,"
"gpu-accelerated compression and visualization of large-scale vessel trajectories in maritime iot industries","2020","The automatic identification system (AIS), an automatic vessel-tracking system, has been widely adopted to perform intelligent traffic management and collision avoidance services in maritime Internet-of-Things (IoT) industries. With the rapid development of maritime transportation, tremendous numbers of AIS-based vessel trajectory data have been collected, which make trajectory data compression imperative and challenging. This article mainly focuses on the compression and visualization of large-scale vessel trajectories and their graphics processing unit (GPU)-accelerated implementations. The visualization was implemented to investigate the influence of compression on vessel trajectory data quality. In particular, the Douglas-Peucker (DP) and kernel density estimation (KDE) algorithms, respectively, utilized for trajectory compression and visualization, were significantly accelerated through the massively parallel computation capabilities of the GPU architecture. Comprehensive experiments on trajectory compression and visualization have been conducted on large-scale AIS data of recording ship movements collected from three different water areas, i.e., the South Channel of Yangtze River Estuary, the Chengshan Jiao Promontory, and the Zhoushan Islands. Experimental results illustrated that: 1) the proposed GPU-based parallel implementation frameworks could significantly reduce the computational time for both trajectory compression and visualization; 2) the influence of compressed vessel trajectories on trajectory visualization could be negligible if the compression threshold was selected suitably; and 3) the Gaussian kernel was capable of generating more appropriate KDE-based visualization performance by comparing with other seven kernel functions.","trajectory compression,Douglas-Peucker algorithm,vessel trajectory data quality,trajectory visualization,Internet of Things,Industries,GPU-accelerated compression,large-scale vessel trajectories,data visualisation,Acceleration,compression threshold,vessel trajectory,parallel computing,ships,KDE-based visualization,marine safety,kernel density estimation,marine engineering,GPU-based parallel implementation frameworks,maritime transportation,graphics processing units,automatic identification system,collision avoidance services,maritime IoT industries,intelligent traffic management,compressed vessel trajectories,KDE algorithm,Artificial intelligence,AIS-based vessel trajectory data,data compression,Data visualization,graphics processing unit (GPU),graphics processing unit,Graphics processing units,Trajectory,maritime Internet-of-Things industries,large-scale AIS data,marine vehicles,automatic vessel-tracking system,"
"multi-proxy evidence of late holocene human-induced environmental changes at lake pupuke, auckland (new zealand)","2009","New Zealand was the last major landmass in the world to be colonised by people. Despite the short time-depth of human presence in the country there is ongoing debate about the date of earliest arrival of people that resulted in the emergence of two contrasting colonisation hypotheses: the Early hypothesis and the Short prehistory. To decide between both hypotheses we employed a range of multi-proxy investigations (geochemistry, stable isotopes and mineral magnetism) on a lacustrine sequence from Lake Pupuke, a maar lake in the city of Auckland and an area potentially among the first places in New Zealand to have been colonised by early people. The environmental history reconstructed from the multi-proxy evidence identified a clear lack of catchment disturbance from c. 2000B.P. until several decades before the eruption of the Rangitoto volcano. The nature and abruptness of disturbance unambiguously point to anthropogenic forcings and are likely to mark the onset of prehistoric human colonisation at the site.

"efficient scheduling for video transmissions in maritime wireless communication networks","2015","This paper develops a framework for vessel surveillance video uploading via maritime wideband communication networks. A broadband wireless network utilizing a time-division-multiple-access (TDMA)-based media access control protocol is employed to establish a shore-side network infrastructure, and a packet store-carry-forward routing mechanism is adopted to achieve intermittent network connectivity in maritime communications. To provide high-quality videos to the administrative authority, a resource allocation problem is formulated to maximize the throughput priority-based video transmission problem, subject to the intermittent network connections and the time indexes such as the release time and deadline of each video packet. To reduce computational complexity, time-capacity mapping is applied to transform the original resource allocation problem into a two-machine nonpreemptive scheduling problem. Three offline scheduling algorithms are proposed, namely, a time-capacity-mapping-based two-phase (TMTP) algorithm for a single machine, a TMTP algorithm for two machines, and an interval graph-theory-based job relay selection (IGTJRS) algorithm. It is mathematically proved that the IGTJRS algorithm has an approximation ratio (i.e., the ratio of the throughput of an optimal schedule to that of the IGTJRS algorithm) of 2 and time complexity of O(n2). Simulations results validate the performance of the proposed algorithms, based on real ship route traces obtained from navigation software BLM-Shipping.","TDMA,time division multiple access,telecommunication network routing,Optimal scheduling,Ports (Computers),shore-side network infrastructure,Throughput,Marine vehicles,Approximation algorithms,job relay selection,Wireless communication,two-phase algorithm,Job-machine scheduling,navigation software BLM-Shipping,time-capacity mapping,telecommunication scheduling,video transmissions,vessel surveillance video,two-machine nonpreemptive scheduling problem,intermittent network connectivity,maritime wideband communication,time complexity,Wideband,maritime wideband communication networks,video transmission,maritime wireless communication networks,time-capacity-mapping,wireless channels,resource allocation problem,graph theory,interval graph theory,broadband wireless network,media access control protocol,broadband networks,computational complexity,marine communication,efficient scheduling,administrative authority,video surveillance,resource allocation,packet store-carry-forward routing mechanism,"
"integrating observational targets and instrumental data on rock coasts through snorkel surveys: a methodological approach","2020","This work deals with recent advances in scientific snorkel surveying, starting from the results of several case studies in the Mediterranean between 2012 and 2018, for a total survey length of 531.4 km, with the aim of illustrating the pros and cons. The snorkel survey method, described here, also called ‘Geoswim’, allows rough-and-ready surveys of long sectors of rocky coasts. In particular, it is able to collect time-lapse images perpendicularly to the coastline and observe long sectors of rocky coastline, with particular reference to the tidal zone. In addition to the photographic survey along the coast, rough measures, lateral variations in geomorphological, geological, biological, and ecological parameters and the collection of hydrological data are usually performed during the work. The expeditions also provide the opportunity to produce large databases of coastal landforms such as coastal sea caves and tidal notches. The data collected can be improved by additional on-the-spot observations. The evaluation of the methodology here proposed was based on the results of SWOT analysis starting from the results and the experience of previous expeditions. Geoswim is the first snorkel approach that allows the collection of large amount of multidisciplinary data along wide sectors of rocky coastline. At the moment, this approach is the best and probably the only technique for characterizing the tidal and nearshore zone, but also to collect observational data of prominent objects along rocky coasts. However, snorkel observations are affected by limitations similar to those of terrestrial field surveys. The ability to observe specific forms or phenomena increases through the practice of field observation and are strongly observer-influenced. Sheltered sea basins are better suited than ocean basins, where tides and wave energy are generally higher. Data collection is also affected by weather and sea conditions. The quality of time-lapse images and videos may be reduced as a result of breakers at the cliffs, producing images that cannot be used for subsequent analysis. As for external factors, some sectors of the coast may be closed due to local restrictions on field activities.","Mediterranean Sea,Sea caves,Geoswim,Coastal geomorphology,Tidal notches,Swim and snorkel surveys,"
"towards video packets store-carry-and-forward scheduling in maritime wideband communication","2013","In this paper, we investigate uploading monitoring videos for vessels via a maritime wideband communication network. The Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX) technology is utilized to establish a shore-side network infrastructure, and a packet store-carry-and-forward routing mechanism is implemented to address the intermittent network connectivity in maritime communications. A resource allocation problem is formulated to maximize the weights of uploaded video packets, subject to the intermittent network connections and the release time and deadline of each video packet. Time-capacity mapping is applied to transform the original resource allocation problem to a two-machine non-preemptive scheduling problem. As ship routes are relatively stable, the global information in terms of release time, deadline and other time indices of video packets, as well as the schedules of vessels is known a priori. We propose two offline scheduling algorithms, namely Time-capacity mapping based two phase (TMTP) algorithm, and Interval graph theory based job relay selection (IGTJRS) algorithm. Both algorithms achieve a time complexity of O(n2). The performance of proposed algorithms is evaluated through simulation based on actual ship route traces obtained from dedicated Navigation software BLM-Ship.","worldwide interoperability for microwave access,telecommunication network routing,Schedules,offline scheduling algorithms,scheduling,Software algorithms,video packets store carry and forward scheduling,telecommunication network topology,Relays,intermittent network connectivity,maritime wideband communication,WiMAX technology,shore side network infrastructure,Wideband,time capacity mapping,resource allocation problem,graph theory,broadband networks,interval graph theory based job relay selection algorithm,marine communication,Scheduling,WiMAX,monitoring videos,resource allocation,WiMax,"
"real time observations of oceanographic and meteorological parameters for maritime transportation: origins and novel applications","2018","The first NOAA Physical Oceanographic Real-Time System (PORTSÂ®) was established in Tampa Bay, Florida, becoming operational in 1991 (https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/ports/index.shtml?port=tb). In April 2018, the Miami Physical Oceanographic Real-Time System was dedicated as the 30th such system in the US, followed closely by Port Everglades PORTSÂ® in June 2018 as the 31st. PORTSÂ® collects and disseminates real time meteorological and oceanographic data within major harbors around the US. PORTSÂ® data are an essential component for maintaining the safety and efficiency of maritime operations. Before the advent of PORTSÂ®, knowledge of environmental conditions relevant to ship operations in US harbors was generally limited to wind and precipitation sensors at the local airports and similar shipboard instrumentation. Water levels were inferred from standard tide tables even though surface winds were known to produce significant deviations from predicted values. This incomplete knowledge often led to navigational errors and to accidents. This paper will review the history of PORTSÂ® development, highlighting recent advances in sensor technologies and novel uses of PORTSÂ® data. On May 9, 1980, the 580 foot, 20,000 ton bulk carrier Summit Venture was approaching a critical turn toward the Sunshine Skyway Bridge in Tampa Bay, Florida and was overtaken by a violent, blinding thunderstorm. The ship veered off course and crashed into a main support pier of the bridge, collapsing the southbound span. Thirty-six people in vehicles fell into the water; 35 did not survive. The main ship channel into Tampa Bay port facilities was closed for 6 weeks, causing severe disruption to supplies of fuel and other commodities to the entire central Florida region. In the wake of the disaster, the local maritime community, led by the Tampa Bay Pilots Association and the Tampa Port Authority, petitioned the US Congress for funding to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to improve environmental monitoring capabilities in the bay. Nearly a decade later, the Tampa Bay Oceanography Project (TOP) began in 1990 as part of NOAA's Coastal Ocean Circulation Program (COCP). This included a 15 month study of currents, water levels, water temperatures, salinity, winds, and other meteorological/oceanographic parameters. By the end of the project, TOP had collected the largest number of circulation measurements in one estuary in the 100-year history of COCP. Successful completion of TOP was followed by permanent deployment of real-time telemetered sensors measuring winds, currents, and water levels at critical locations in the bay - the first official NOAA PORTSÂ® installation. Since 1991, local operations and maintenance of the system have been directed by the Greater Tampa Bay Marine Advisory Council-PORTS, Inc., a non-profit consortium of maritime interests, through cooperative agreements with the NOAA National Ocean Service Center for Operational Products and Services and the University of South Florida Center for Maritime and Port Studies. The success of TB-PORTS made it a prototype for a national program. Within three years of TB-PORTS becoming operational, San Francisco Bay and Houston/Galveston Bay implemented their own PORTSÂ® networks. Today PORTSÂ® operates 24 hours a day/7 days a week in 31 locations around the coasts and Great Lakes of the United States and is a component of the Integrated Ocean Observing System national backbone. The local operation and maintenance of PORTSÂ® facilities in each port remains funded by local maritime interests under the direction of NOAA/NOS/CO-OPS, who sets operational standards and manages the data quality control and dissemination through the Continuous Operational Real-Time Monitoring System (CORMS). PORTSÂ® data are provided to the public through the NOAA websitehttp://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/ports.html. A prototype project in Tampa Bay provides PORTSÂ® data to pilots aboard ships over the Automatic Identification System (AIS), now required on all commercial vessels over 20 m in length, in collaboration with the US Coast Guard R&D Center. The long time series observations of winds, currents, water levels, and other parameters in Tampa Bay from PORTSÂ® has fueled numerous scientific studies on the dynamics of the estuary. New sensor technologies have been incorporated into the PORTSÂ® data stream in recent years, including wave height, period, and direction, atmospheric visibility, and most recently, current measurements from sensors mounted on standard US Coast Guard aids to navigation buoys.","water levels,tides,Marine vehicles,transportation,https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/ports/index.shtml,Bridges,Sea measurements,environmental monitoring (geophysics),Maritime transportation,oceanographic equipment,ships,marine safety,real-time systems,Oceans,US Government agencies,NOAA websitehttp://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/ports.html,quality control,sea ports,Real-time systems,oceanographic regions,Tampa Bay port facilities,wind,precision navigation,bridges (structures),ocean observing,Greater Tampa Bay Marine Advisory Council-PORTS,Sensors,Port Everglades PORTS,TB-PORTS,oceanographic techniques,"

Spatial classification of positive and negative growth anomalies and their occurrence within altitudinal zones, results in nine differing sub-groups of pointer years. In total, 39 years between 1901 and 1971AD are subdivided into these groups. The other 32 years show only growth anomalies in less than 40% of the research area, and therefore were excluded from further investigations. Climatological interpretation of the growth patterns of the nine groups documents mutual temperature and precipitation forcings. Extreme positive pointer years represent optimal growth conditions, i.e., moderate cool and wet conditions during the growing season. For the other years we summarize (i) warm and wet (warm and dry) springs result in positive (negative) anomalies in the Central European lowlands and (ii) warm (cold) summers result in positive (negative) anomalies in the Central European highlands. In some years, however, similar climatological conditions yield to divergent growth response patterns.","Extreme growth,Network analyses,Site ecology,GIS,Growth/climate response,"
"optimising maritime processes via artificial intelligence: the vesselai concept and use cases","2022","The beginning of this decade finds artificial intelligence, high performance computing (HPC), and big data analytics in the forefront of digital transformation that is projected to heavily impact various industries and domains.

"post-rift volcanic structures of the pernambuco plateau, northeastern brazil","2016","The Pernambuco marginal basin is located on the eastern continental margin of northeastern Brazil, covers an area of 20,800 km2, and represents one of the most prominent frontiers for deep water oil and gas exploration off the Brazilian coast. The onshore region of this basin was highly affected by extrusive and intrusive magmatism during the Upper Albian, and the relation of that event with the volcanic structures observed in the offshore sector has not been thoroughly characterized to date. This study aims to characterize the major extrusive and intrusive volcanic structures of the offshore portion of this basin, which is dominated by the Pernambuco Plateau, and its stratigraphic relations. A set of 143 2D multichannel seismic sections that cover the Pernambuco Plateau region are used to interpret the major tectono-stratigraphic sequences and describe the distribution of volcanoes, sills, vent complexes and related volcaniclastic sequences. The interpretations are supported by aeromagnetic and gravimetric geophysical surveys. Volcanoes are classified into two groups that differ in terms of their morphology: shield-like structures and cone-shaped volcanic structures. Sill intrusions are mainly identified beneath the volcanic structures and are characterized by high-amplitude reflectors with short extensions and abrupt terminations. Volcaniclastic sequences are found adjacent to the volcanoes and are characterized by high-amplitude, disrupted reflections with local chaotic configurations. Vent complexes are classified on the basis of their morphologies as either eye-shaped or crater-shaped. The volcanic features identified within the available seismic dataset are concentrated in two main areas: in the centre of the plateau and near its northeastern border. These two regions are host basement outer highs and are surrounded by hyper-extended continental crust, which forms the plateau itself. The extrusive and intrusive features described in the offshore region were formed during the post rift Cretaceous and Cenozoic intervals and point to the continuation of magmatic events after the rifting process. The findings presented in this report provide a better understanding of the magmatism on the northeastern passive margin of Brazil and can also be useful for future modelling of the Pernambuco Basin petroleum system.","Seismic stratigraphy,South Atlantic rift,Volcanic structures,Pernambuco Basin,"

"recent evolution of marmolada glacier (dolomites, italy) by means of ground and airborne gpr surveys","2019","A 10-year-long evolution of ice thickness and volume of the Marmolada glacier is presented. Quantitative measurements have been performed by using two different Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) datasets. A ground-based survey using two different ground-coupled systems equipped with 100 MHz and 35 MHz antennas was performed in 2004. In 2015 the dataset was collected by using a helicopter-borne step frequency GPR equipped with a 100 MHz antenna. Through a critical discussion of the two different methodologies, we show how both approaches are useful to estimate the ice volume within a glacier, as well as its morphological characteristics and changes with time, even if datasets are acquired in different periods of the year. The observed 2004–2014 ice volume reduction of the Marmolada glacier is equal to about 30%, while the area covered by ice decreased by about 22%. The glacier is now splitted in several separated units. It is very likely that the fragmentation of the Marmolada glacier observed in the period 2004–2014 was accelerated due to irregular karst topography. By applying the observed 2004–2014 ice-melting trend for the future although the Marmolada glacier might behave slightly differently compared to glaciers on non-karstic terrains owing to dominant vertical subglacial drainage, it will likely disappear by the year 2050. Only few isolated very small and thin ice patches will eventually survive due to avalanche feeding and shading at the foot of the north-facing cliffs.",""
"timing of the neoglacial onset on the north-eastern antarctic peninsula based on lacustrine archive from lake anónima, vega island","2020","To understand the complexity of the climate patterns in the Holocene, it is necessary to build detailed chronologies that provide a holistic picture of the individual climate periods occurring in the polar regions. In this regard, here we present a completely new, 14C-dated and synchronised multi-proxy chronology from the Lake Anónima (Vega Island, north-eastern Antarctic Peninsula) that provides a unique insight into the Late Holocene environment. In particular, we aim to interpret the substantial environmental and climatic change between the mid-late Holocene Hypsithermal and Neoglacial periods using various geochemical (total organic carbon, X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy), petrophysical (magnetic susceptibility, laser granulometry) and biological (diatom biostratigraphy) proxies. The termination of the mid-late Holocene Hypsithermal, characterised by overall warmer climate with favourable conditions for biogenic productivity, is followed by the regional-scale Neoglacial period, distinctive by the onset of climate deterioration, decreased siliciclastic input, suppressed biogenic (diatom) productivity and low organic content. Based on a principal component analysis, a multi-proxy record provides the precise timing of the Neoglacial onset in the Lake Anónima record at 2050 (2σ: 1990–2130) cal. yrs BP. Applying an adjacent and correlative ice-core (James Ross Island ice cap, r = 0.42), as well as a composite lake sediment (Beak Island, r = 0.49) chronologies, our research provides a refined timing of the Neoglacial onset for the north-eastern Antarctic Peninsula, which is determined to be 2070 ± 50 yrs.

"lake sediments from southern norway capture holocene variations in flood seasonality","2022","Owing to the combined impact of human encroachment and global climate change, river flood hazards have increased around the world. Over the past decades, rapid warming has augmented atmospheric moisture fluxes. The resulting intensification of the hydrological cycle, as evident from instrumental records, is linked to more frequent and severe flooding. However, this observational baseline is too short to adequately assess long-term flood variability under different climate conditions. Geological archives can fill this critical knowledge gap by providing long-term (millennia) empirical constraints on the magnitude and frequency of floods. To reconstruct the frequency of flood events over the last >8000 years, this study investigated the Holocene lacustrine sediments from Lake Lygne in southwestern Norway. The precipitation in this area is sourced from the North Atlantic Ocean and transported by the prevalent westerly winds. As such, reconstructions of flood frequency variability may shed light on past moisture flux and flood generating weather systems in this part of northwestern Europe. We applied a multiproxy approach to robustly fingerprint the flood sediment signatures using multiple independent lines of evidence. This approach included analysing the sediments using X-ray fluorescence (XRF), computed tomography (CT scanning), and magnetic susceptibility (MS). We identified two types of event beds that differed significantly from background sedimentation throughout the sedimentary archive, which we interpreted as river flood deposits: one type is minerogenic and coarse silt-dominated; the other is a composite of minerogenic sediments and macrofossils. By comparing the sediment record with instrumental water discharge data from the last 100 years, we argue that these differing flood signals represent two flood regimes: rainfall-triggered floods during autumn and snowmelt-triggered floods during spring. Conducting a rate of change (RoC) analysis, we found significant millennial- and centennial-scale variability in the frequency of flood events. Moreover, comparing our findings with palaeoclimate reconstructions in the North Atlantic region, we found that the warmer than present early-mid-Holocene was dominated by extreme precipitation-triggered floods, shifting towards more snowmelt-triggered floods in the late Holocene.","Floods,Lake sediments,North Atlantic,Palaeoclimatology,Holocene,"

"anomaly detection in maritime data based on geometrical analysis of trajectories","2015","Anomaly detection is an important use of the Automatic Identification Systems (AIS), because it offers support to users to evaluate if a vessel is in trouble or causing trouble. For instance, it can be used to detect if a ship is doing something that may cause an accident or if it has changed its route to avoid bad weather condition. In this work, a new method for finding anomalies in the ships' movements is proposed. The method analyzes the trajectory of ships from a geometrical perspective. The trajectory of the ship is compared with a near-optimal path that is generated by a graph search algorithm. The proposed method extracts some scale-invariant features from the real trajectory and also from the optimal movement pattern, and it compares the two sets of features to generate an abnormality score. The method is unsupervised and it does not require training. Instead of labeling the trajectories as normal/abnormal it calculates a score value that denotes the extent of abnormality. The scoring scheme provides a ranking system in which the user can sort the trajectories based on their abnormality score. This is useful when dealing with large number of trajectories and the user wants to picks the most abnormal cases. For the evaluation, the method was run on three months data of North Pacific Ocean and score values were generated. Among the entire dataset, 100 randomly chosen trajectories were labeled by an expert. After applying a threshold on the score value, the proposed method had 94% accuracy.","maritime data,Clustering algorithms,randomly chosen trajectories,optimal movement pattern,anomaly detection,North Pacific Ocean,Marine vehicles,abnormality score,Mathematical model,Feature extraction,geometrical trajectories analysis,scale-invariant features,ships,marine engineering,bad weather condition,AIS,Oceans,near-optimal path,ship trajectory,ship movements,graph theory,graph search algorithm,Joining processes,score values,search problems,Trajectory,automatic identification systems,"

Compared to nearby in situ gages, ENVISAT and Jason-2 observations over the lower Garonne River mainstream (110 km upstream of the estuary) have the smallest errors, with water elevation anomalies root mean square errors (RMSE) around 50cm and 20cm, respectively. The few ENVISAT upstream measurements have RMSE ranging from 80cm to 160cm. Over the estuary, ENVISAT and SARAL water elevation anomalies RMSE are around 30cm and 10cm, respectively. The most recent altimetry mission, SARAL, does not provide river elevation measurements for most satellite overflights of the river mainstream. The altimeter remains “locked” on the top of surrounding hilly areas and does not observe the steep-sided river valley, which could be 50–100m lower. This phenomenon is also observed, for fewer dates, on Jason-2 and ENVISAT measurements. In these cases, the measurement is not “erroneous”, it just does not correspond to water elevation of the river that is covered by the satellite. ENVISAT is less prone to get ‘locked’ on the top of the topography due to some differences in the instrument measurement parameters, trading lower accuracy for more useful measurements. Such problems are specific to continental surfaces (or near the coasts), but are not observed over the open oceans, which are flatter. To overcome this issue, an experimental instrument operating mode, called the DIODE/DEM tracking mode, has been developed by CNES (Centre National d’Etudes Spatiales) and has been tested during few Jason-2 cycles and during the first SARAL/AltiKA cycle. This tracking mode “forces” the instrument to observe a target of interest, i.e. water bodies. The example of the Garonne River shows, for one SARAL ground track, the benefit of the DIODE/DEM tracking mode for a steep-sided river reach, which is not detected using the nominal instrument operating mode. Yet, this mode relies on ancillary datasets (a priori global DEM and global land/water mask), which are critical to obtain river valley observation. The ultimately computed elevations along the satellite tracks, loaded on board, should have an absolute vertical accuracy around 10m (or better). This case also shows, when the instrument is correctly observing the river valley, that the altimeter can detect water bodies narrower than 100m (like an artificial canal). In agreement with recent studies, this work shows that altimeter missions can provide useful water elevation measurements over a 200m wide river with RMSE as low as 50cm and 20cm, for ENVISAT and Jason-2 respectively. The seasonal cycle can be observed with the temporal sampling of these missions (35 days and 10 days, respectively), but short term events, like flood events, are most of the time not observed. It also illustrates that altimeter capability to observe a river is highly dependent of the surrounding topography, the observation configuration, previous measurements and the instrument design. Therefore, it is not possible to generalize at global scale the minimum river width that could be seen by altimeters. This study analyzes, for the first time, the potential of the experimental DIODE/DEM tracking mode to observe steep-sided narrow river valleys, which are frequently missed with nominal tracking mode. For such case, using the DIODE/DEM mode could provide water elevation measurements, as long as the on board DEM is accurate enough. This mode should provide many more valid measurements over steep-sided rivers than currently observed.","SARAL,Garonne River,DIODE/DEM mode,Satellite altimetry,ENVISAT,Jason-2,"

"an integrated gis approach for sustainable aquaculture management area site selection","2008","Within New Zealand, growth in the aquaculture industry has led to the diversification of aquaculture sites from more sheltered bays and harbours toward open coast locations. Coastal zone managers, along with the aquaculture industry, aim to ensure the long-term sustainability of any ‘new’ sites selected. Through targeted data collection programmes and the subsequent implementation of Geographic Information System (GIS) based models, the most suitable and sustainable locations for Aquaculture Management Areas (AMAs) can be identified. This approach is applied within the Bay of Plenty, New Zealand, with specific reference to suspended mussel (Perna canaliculus) aquaculture. Within the region, areas where maximum sustainability may be achieved make up 18% of the total area considered, with conflicting uses and other constraints accounting for 46%. Whilst further site and development specific studies are required to determine explicit carrying capacities, the effort required has been considerably reduced by eliminating unsuitable locations and identifying those where sustainability can be maximised.",""
"geology of the río de la plata and the surrounding areas of argentina and uruguay related to the evolution of the atlantic margin","2018","An integrated study of geological and geophysical data of the Río de la Plata region and its relation to the evolution of the Atlantic passive margin is herein described. This characterization is based on the available geological and geophysical information and on the correlation of the southern end of the best-known Santa Lucía Basin in Uruguay to the Salado Basin in Argentina, and their connection through the Quilmes Trough. Furthermore, a new Meso-Cenozoic depocenter is characterized and identified as Recalada Trough, subparallely aligned to the Quilmes Trough and separated from it by the Magdalena-Montevideo High. Both sedimentary fillings present ENE-WSW trending main axes and reach an average thickness of almost 2000 m. This suggests an evolution from a triple junction where interconnected extensional arms developed, which have had common Mesozoic tectosedimentary histories related to the early opening of the Atlantic Ocean. Based on the geophysical and geological evidence, the previously accepted existence in the Río de la Plata of a first-order structural feature along the international border between Argentina and Uruguay, associated to an ENE-WSW trending tectonic high, identified as Martín García, is unjustified. The tectonic evolution of the Atlantic margin in front of the Río de la Plata estuary is the consequence of a long deformation history starting in the Precambrian up to recent times. Each Precambrian, Paleozoic, Mesozoic and Cenozoic tectonic scenario adds different weak trends on the continental crust, which control the evolution of the sedimentary depocenters. The presence of these tectosedimentary records influence the bathymetric control of the Río de la Plata and the dynamics of the recent estuarine deposits. The Meso-Cenozoic sedimentary infill is estimated to comprise considerable ranges of sandstones and conglomerates associated with faulted blocks of the crystalline basement, with expected petrophysical conditions oscillating in the order of 12%–15% of effective porosity and with expected traps of the stratigraphic and combined (closing against faulting) type, and overlapped by fine sediments with excellent quality as seals. The economic significance of these sedimentary volumes lies in their yet unexplored potential as natural fluid reservoirs (hydrocarbons and groundwater), of great importance due to their strategic position near the large urban areas of Buenos Aires and Montevideo.","Meso-Cenozoic depocenters,Río de la Plata,Rifting South Atlantic,Basement,"

"tectonic applications of magnetic susceptibility and its anisotropy","1997","Anisotropy of low field magnetic susceptibility (AMS) is a versatile petrofabric tool. For magnetite, AMS primarily defines grain-shape anisotropy; for other minerals, AMS expresses crystallographic control on magnetic properties. Thus, we may infer the orientation-distribution of a dominant mineral from the AMS of a rock. AMS principal directions can record current directions from sediment, flow-directions from magma, finite-strain directions from tectonized rocks and stress-directions from low-strain, low-temperature, neotectonic environments. AMS measurements may reveal some aspects of the strain-path, where carefully selected. For example, we may compare different parts of a heterogeneously strained domain, different minerals in a homogeneously strained site, AMS with schistosity/mineral lineation, and AMS with remanence-anisotropy. Such measurements isolate the orientation-distributions of different minerals, adding a temporal scale to the kinematic sequence. Normally, we can interpret the principal directions of AMS distributions as a physically significant direction, such as a current direction, magmatic flow or finite-strain axis. However, calibrating the AMS ellipsoid shape against the magnitude of the controlling physical process is very difficult. Primarily, this is because the shape of the AMS ellipsoid combines contributions from several minerals whose individual AMS ellipsoids are of different shape. Thus, small variations in the proportions of minerals change the shape of the rock's AMS ellipsoid, even if the alignment process were of constant intensity. In deformed rocks, AMS is more strain-sensitive than calcite twinning or the alignment of calcite or quartz c-axes. Not all AMS fabrics relate to crystallographic or grain alignment. First, displacement fabrics generate AMS where an isotropic matrix of high susceptibility displaces unevenly spaced objects of low susceptibility and suitable scales. Second, AMS location fabrics occur where sub-isometric magnetite grains are close enough, in certain directions, for their demagnetizing fields to interact. This accounts for the AMS of many magnetite-dominated signals where there is no aligned magnetite. Third, the AMS of single-domain magnetite is inverse to shape so that such grains may oppose the AMS contribution of parallel minerals. Finally, transitional sedimentary-tectonic or magmatic-tectonic fabrics yield smeared, temporal sequences of AMS principal directions that cannot be immediately attributed to a single alignment process. These transitional AMS ellipsoids mix primary and secondary AMS components, making it difficult to characterize either component. However, such fabric combinations may permit us to recognize the sense of shearing in flow processes.","tectonic stress,AMS,tectonic deformation,magnetic susceptibility,anisotropy,crystal or grain alignment,petrofabrics,"
"reasons behind seasonal and monthly precipitation variability in the qinghai-tibet plateau and its surrounding areas during 1979∼2017","2023","The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) is a hotspot in the study of global climate change due to its profound impact on the atmospheric water cycle in Asia and even the world. Previous studies on the QTP mainly focused on the spatial distribution of precipitation and its changing trend. To investigate the temporal and spatial variations of precipitation variability on the QTP, this study applied the standardized variability index (SVI) based on entropy on its daily precipitation without any preset distribution. The results showed that for most monsoon months in the past 40 years, SVI has a significant downward trend in the southwest foot of the Himalayas and the border zone between barren and grassland areas, indicating that precipitation has become more uniform, which is beneficial for growth of grassland. However, the Hurst exponent shows that such trend will reverse in the future, which may cause natural disasters such as landslides and debris flows in the monsoon period considering the large amount of precipitation and the local topographic conditions in the southwest of the Himalayan foothills. The inducements of such precipitation variability were also studied, including Asian monsoon, westerly jets, sea-land thermal difference, and Sea Surface Temperature (SST). Compared with the monsoon index, the sea-land thermal difference has a stronger correlation with the precipitation variability. The SST anomaly closer to the east coast of the equatorial Pacific also has a great impact on the variability of precipitation over the plateau. This study contributes to understanding precipitation variability in the QTP at a sub-seasonal period.","Entropy,Standardized variability index (SVI),Seasonal/Monthly precipitation variability,Influencing factors on precipitation variability,Qinghai-Tibet Plateau,"
"system controls of coastal and open ocean oxygen depletion","2021","The epoch of the Anthropocene, a period during which human activity has been the dominant influence on climate and the environment, has witnessed a decline in oxygen concentrations and an expansion of oxygen-depleted environments in both coastal and open ocean systems since the middle of the 20th century. This paper provides a review of system-specific drivers of low oxygen in a range of case studies representing marine systems in the open ocean, on continental shelves, in enclosed seas and in the coastal environment. Identification of similar and contrasting responses within and across system types and corresponding oxygen regimes is shown to be informative both in understanding and isolating key controlling processes and provides a sound basis for predicting change under anticipated future conditions. Case studies were selected to achieve a balance in system diversity and global coverage. Each case study describes system attributes, including the present-day oxygen environment and known trends in oxygen concentrations over time. Central to each case study is the identification of the physical and biogeochemical processes that determine oxygen concentrations through the tradeoff between ventilation and respiration. Spatial distributions of oxygen and time series of oxygen data provide the opportunity to identify trends in oxygen availability and have allowed various drivers of low oxygen to be distinguished through correlative and causative relationships. Deoxygenation results from a complex interplay of hydrographic and biogeochemical processes and the superposition of these processes, some additive and others subtractive, makes attribution to any particular driver challenging. System-specific models are therefore required to achieve a quantitative understanding of these processes and of the feedbacks between processes at varying scales.","Deoxygenation,Eutrophication,Respiration,Global warming,Stratification,Ventilation,"

"triton: high-speed maritime wireless mesh network","2013","This article presents the TRI-media Telematic Oceanographic Network (TRITON) project, which aims to develop a high-speed and low-cost maritime communication system. The article includes information pertaining to background studies, high-level architecture, network feasibility, maritime communication environment, technology developments, prototype implementations and link performance measurements. The motivation for this project stems from the fact that there is an increasing need for low-cost and high-speed maritime communication, with demands mainly coming from regulatory and crew welfare needs. The system described in this article is a wireless mesh network based on the IEEE 802.16. An analysis of the node connectivity based on real ship traffic data shows that the network is feasible in shipping lanes with a high density of ships. The system also considers the use of an intelligent middleware to allow communications to switch back to a satellite link in cases where neighboring ships are sparse or at locations far away from mesh base stations.

"life history of an anticyclonic eddy in the algerian basin from altimetry data, tracking algorithm and in situ observations.","2020","Frequently-forming long-life mesoscale eddies are observed in the Algerian Basin that influence the circulation of the wider Western Mediterranean Sea. Most of these structures store and transport water masses including associated physical and biological properties throughout the entire basin. In order to study the evolution of a long-life anticyclonic eddy, we use a multiplatform approach based on remote sensing data analysis and in situ measurements. We present a case study of an anticyclonic eddy that persisted for 17 months within the basin. The feature was identified through a hybrid method of eddy detection and tracking applied to altimetry data, and sampled twice during two different oceanographic cruises in autumn 2004 and late spring 2005. Transect observations of potential temperature, salinity, density and the dissolved oxygen concentration were utilised to infer water mass properties and eddy characteristics. In situ data show that water of Atlantic origin, initially trapped by the eddy during its formation, was modified during the eddy lifetime. The time evolution of radius, kinetic energy and vorticity suggests dividing the eddy lifetime into three phases: the eddy formation, an intermediate period of high variability and a final, lower energy phase. The track followed by the eddy confirms the hypothesis of an interaction with the North Balearic Front and a consequent change of the eddy's physical properties. Decomposing the eddy's kinetic energy into mean and fluctuating terms allows us to describe its interaction with the mean circulation of the basin. In particular during formation, the southern part of the eddy absorbs energy from the mean circulation, while it provides energy to the mean flow in its northern part. In the second phase, when the eddy is far from the coast, it receives energy from the mean flow. Combining in situ data analysis with the results of the satellite-imagery-based detection and tracking method has proven to be a very useful method in assessing the evolution of a mesoscale structure in the Algerian Basin and its interaction with the large scale ocean dynamics of the Western Mediterranean Sea.",""
"the geochemistry of gem opals as evidence of their origin","2008","Seventy-seven gem opals from ten countries were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) through a dilution process, in order to establish the nature of the impurities. The results are correlated to the mode of formation and physical properties and are instrumental in establishing the geographical origin of a gem opal. The geochemistry of an opal is shown to be dependant mostly on the host rock, at least for examples from Mexico and Brazil, even if modified by weathering processes. In order of decreasing concentration, the main impurities present are Al, Ca, Fe, K, Na, and Mg (more than 500 ppm). Other noticeable elements in lesser amounts are Ba, followed by Zr, Sr, Rb, U, and Pb. For the first time, geochemistry helps to discriminate some varieties of opals. The Ba content, as well as the chondrite-normalized REE pattern, are the keys to separating sedimentary opals (Ba>110 ppm, Eu and Ce anomalies) from volcanic opals (Ba<110 ppm, no Eu or Ce anomaly). The Ca content, and to a lesser extent that of Mg, Al, K and Nb, helps to distinguish gem opals from different volcanic environments. The limited range of concentrations for all elements in precious (play-of-color) compared to common opals, indicates that this variety must have very specific, or more restricted, conditions of formation. We tentatively interpreted the presence of impurities in terms of crystallochemistry, even if opal is a poorly crystallized or amorphous material. The main replacement is the substitution of Si4+ by Al3+ and Fe3+. The induced charge imbalance is compensated chiefly by Ca2+, Mg2+, Mn2+, Ba2+, K+, and Na+. In terms of origin of color, greater concentrations of iron induce darker colors (from yellow to “chocolate brown”). This element inhibits luminescence for concentrations above 1000 ppm, whereas already a low content in U (≤1 ppm) induces a green luminescence.","Opal,Trace element analysis,Chemical composition,Genesis,ICP-MS,"
"detection of signals linked to climate change, land-cover change and climate oscillators in tropical montane cloud forests","2021","Tropical Montane Cloud Forests (TMCFs) form biodiverse communities that are characterized by frequent occurrence of low-level clouds from which they capture a substantial proportion of their precipitation — here referred to as occult precipitation. TMCFs provide important ecosystem services, in particular the supply of water to their wider surroundings. Throughout the tropics (here 23.5∘ S to 23.5∘ N), they are under pressure from deforestation and poor land management which leads to loss of both forest area and species diversity, and reduces their capture of occult precipitation. Climate change may also reduce occult precipitation in TMCFs since the cloud base may lift in response to higher temperatures — the ‘lifting cloud-base hypothesis’. These threats to TMCFs are well understood, but their quantitative assessment is hampered by 1) uncertainty in the location and spatial extent of TMCFs and 2) limited availability of representative meteorological data. We use a Random Forest Classifier — informed by topographic data, MODIS vegetation data, TRMM precipitation data and ERA5-Land and MERRA-2 reanalysis products — to estimate the spatial distribution and extent of TMCFs (2.1 × 106 km2 ± 0.5 × 106 km2). We analyze temporal changes in climate, tree-cover and greenness of TMCFs over the past two to four decades to detect 1) multi-decadal trends, and 2) associations with the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD). Evidence for the ‘lifting cloud-base hypothesis’ in reanalysis products was inconsistent across the tropics; a lifting of the cloud base during the past four decades occurred for about 20% of TMCFs, predominantly in the Americas and a few locations in Africa, while in Asia a downward movement of the cloud base was found. However, these results in part depend on the bias correction applied to the reanalyses. Changes in TMCF tree cover and greenness varied by continent; in Africa in 50% of TMCFs tree cover declined, whereas TMCFs in the Americas and in Asia exhibited a net increase in tree cover, despite a reduction in tree cover in ~20% of these TMCFs. An important limitation of the tree-cover data is that they do not distinguish between natural tree cover and agro-forestry. ENSO signals were more strongly present in precipitation in American and Asian TMCFs, whereas IOD signals were stronger in TMCF temperature and dewpoint temperature across the tropics. ENSO and IOD signals were approximately equally important for precipitation in African TMCFs and in cloud-base height across the tropics. An arbitrary warming of 1 ∘C and a 100 m lifting of the cloud base, in accordance with the ‘lifting cloud hypothesis’, imposed on the Random Forest classifier showed a decline in the extent of TMCFs in the Americas and Africa, but an increase in Asia — mostly at the expense of evergreen broadleaf forests. The greater vulnerability of TMCFs in Africa may be linked to their more isolated and scattered distribution across the continent and drier conditions compared to a more continuous distribution and wetter conditions in the Americas and Asia.","IOD,ENSO,TRMM,Tropical Montane Cloud Forests,Reanalysis,MODIS,Climate change,Cloud-base height,"
"building defect detection: external versus internal thermography","2016","Many buildings suffer from defects in the building envelope, such as missing insulation, thermal bridging, cracks and moisture problems. Thermography is one technology that can help to identify such defects. However, there are different approaches towards assessing the building envelope. Pass-by thermography is an emerging method, which is used to capture single thermal images of external building elevations. Compared with traditional walk-through thermography, it is much quicker and cheaper to perform. Yet it is currently unclear how successful this methodology is at detecting building defects. This paper qualitatively compares pass-by thermography and walk-through thermography. A set of 122 residential dwellings in South West England was inspected using the both methodologies. Results show that substantially more defects were detected using walk-through thermography, with internal inspections yielding the greatest number of detected defects. Significant constraints with walk-past thermography were identified, such as unknown occupancy behaviour, transient climatic conditions, fixed viewing angles and spatial resolution limitations, which were all found to have a greater impact on image results than during walk-through thermography. Although trends in conductivity defects were found from target comparison analysis between similar dwellings, viewing single external elevations under walk-past thermography was found to miss many different defect types, which would have normally been discovered during traditional walk-through thermography.","Defect detection,Walk-past,Thermography,Walk-through,"
"accelerated loss of alpine glaciers in the kodar mountains, south-eastern siberia","2013","The recession of mountain glaciers around the world has been linked to anthropogenic climate change and small glaciers (e.g. <2km2) are thought to be particularly vulnerable, with reports of their disappearance from several regions. However, the response of small glaciers to climate change can be modulated by non-climatic factors such as topography and debris cover and there remain a number of regions where their recent change has evaded scrutiny. This paper presents results of the first multi-year remote sensing survey of glaciers in the Kodar Mountains, the only glaciers in SE Siberia, which we compare to previous glacier inventories from this continental setting that reported total glacier areas of 18.8km2 in ca. 1963 (12.6km2 of exposed ice) and 15.5km2 in 1974 (12km2 of exposed ice). Mapping their debris-covered termini is difficult but delineation of debris-free ice on Landsat imagery reveals 34 glaciers with a total area of 11.72±0.72km2 in 1995, followed by a reduction to 9.53±0.29km2 in 2001 and 7.01±0.23km2 in 2010. This represents a ~44% decrease in exposed glacier ice between ca. 1963 and 2010, but with 40% lost since 1995 and with individual glaciers losing as much as 93% of their exposed ice. Thus, although continental glaciers are generally thought to be less sensitive than their maritime counterparts, a recent acceleration in shrinkage of exposed ice has taken place and we note its coincidence with a strong summer warming trend in the region initiated at the start of the 1980s. Whilst smaller and shorter glaciers have, proportionally, tended to shrink more rapidly, we find no statistically significant relationship between shrinkage and elevation characteristics, aspect or solar radiation. This is probably due to the small sample size, limited elevation range, and topographic setting of the glaciers in deep valleys-heads. Furthermore, many of the glaciers possess debris-covered termini and it is likely that the ablation of buried ice is lagging the shrinkage of exposed ice, such that a growth in the proportion of debris cover is occurring, as observed elsewhere. If recent trends continue, we hypothesise that glaciers could evolve into a type of rock glacier within the next few decades, introducing additional complexity in their response and delaying their potential demise.","Mountain glaciers,Remote sensing,Kodar Mountains,Russia,Climate change,"

"demand and supply-side determinants of electric power consumption and representative roadmaps to 100% renewable systems","2021","The need to transform electric power systems to a cleaner electricity mix to help save the climate is undisputable but existing transition pathways have become unreliable due to inadequate representation of both demand and supply-side determinants of electric power supply, as well as failure to inculcate volatility in electric power systems in the core transition modelling. This study inculcates demand and supply-side determinants to investigate the long- and short-run causal relationships between the electric power system, macroeconomic performance, demography, environmental quality, and capital formation, for Sweden. We also propose and implement econometric and two-stage attention-based machine learning models for volatility-consistent electric power forecasting. Using annual data spanning 1990–2018, the results suggest a long-run relationship exists between electricity generation and the independent variables. Empirical results for the volatility-consistent attention-based machine learning model predict that Sweden’s electric power demand in 2050 could reach ∼112 TWh if conservation practices are implemented, and ∼146 TWh if otherwise. If conservation practices are implemented, evidence from selected volatility-consistent simulations show that Sweden can provide 100% of all her electricity demand from cleaner sources by 2030. The findings depict that Sweden must implement stringent and radical policies to achieve its mid-century green electricity targets.","Demand and supply-side determinants,100% renewable Electricity consumption,Two-stage attention-based recurrent neural network,Volatility-consistent cleaner electricity transition pathways,Causality,Climate change,"
"building resilience through foresight: the case of maritime container shipping firms","2022","Maritime container shipping (MCS) firms represent the backbone of worldwide supply chains. Due to the emergence of global trends and disruptions, MCS firms increasingly face an uncertain environment. Consequently, MCS firms must develop dynamic capabilities to enable the reconfiguration of organizational resources for building resilience in a constantly changing business ecosystem. To create adequate dynamic capabilities, MCS firms need to anticipate the future of their macro environment through advanced foresight techniques. Using a Delphi-based scenario analysis, this study systematically examines scenarios for MCS firmsâ€™ macro environment. Twelve projections for the MCS industry were systematically created and were then assessed by 51 maritime experts. The resulting three distinct scenarios deliver valuable insights for MCS firmsâ€™ executives, whereas the blockchains and drones technology will have already increased efficiency in the short-term scenario â€œpicking the low-hanging fruit,â€ other technological disruptions will only affect the industry in the medium-term scenario â€œexperiencing an era of dichotomy.â€ In the long-term scenario â€œovercoming the obstacles of the generational shift,â€ MCS firms will experience a transfer toward alternative fuel powered and autonomously driven vessels. Offering detailed scenarios for the future MCS macro environment, this study represents a guide for decision-makers on how to create dynamic capabilities in MCS firms to build resilience. Moreover, the results revealed differences in the expertsâ€™ assessments due to their characteristics. Therefore, the study contributes to the academic focus on in-depth diversity analysis in the Delphi methodology and emphasizes the relevance of incorporating multiple stakeholders and panelists in future planning.","Pandemics,freight transportation,maritime,Uncertainty,scenarios,technology foresight,Delphi,Containers,COVID-19,judgmental forecasting,Bibliographies,Industries,Planning,Supply chains,"
"eloran: resilient positioning, navigation, and timing infrastructure in maritime areas","2020","Global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and localization technology have become highly compact and effective. Although GNSS has been proven to be vulnerable to jamming when the signal strength is weak, most vehicles rely on it for navigation. Compared to GNSS, enhanced Loran (eLoran) is more resistant to jamming and is recommended as a realistic alternative to GNSS. Therefore, South Korea embarked on an eLoran testbed development project to provide resilient navigation information for maritime users. The primary goal of this project was to demonstrate that the system can provide a 20-m position accuracy to the maritime user within a 30-km coverage of a differential Loran station. In this paper, we describe the development of the eLoran testbed implementation and the performance of its preliminary experimental results.

"recent computer vision applications for pavement distress and condition assessment","2023","Amidst the unprecedented demographic boom, coupled with climate change, more pressure is being exerted on road networks. Asset managers are thus in search for time and cost-effective state-of-the-art technologies for road inspection and condition monitoring. This paper provides an up-to-date comprehensive review of Computer Vision (CV) models and applications in pavement distress detection, classification, segmentation, quantification and condition assessment. To this end, the objectives of this review are: (1) review and bibliometric analysis of 190 related recent publications; (2) identification of trending tools, research gaps, emerging technologies, challenges and limitations of using CV for pavement distress and condition assessment; and (3) guiding of future research related to CV pavement asset management. While CV related models saw a sharp increase recently, increased collaboration between the academia and the industry is still needed to improve applicability levels of such models by pavement management agencies.","Condition assessment,Distress detection,Computer vision,Pavement management,"

"ship behavior prediction via trajectory extraction-based clustering for maritime situation awareness","2022","This study presents a method in which historical AIS data are used to predict the future trajectory of a selected vessel. This is facilitated via a system intelligence-based approach that can be subsequently utilized to provide enhanced situation awareness to navigators and future autonomous ships, aiding proactive collision avoidance. By evaluating the historical ship behavior in a given geographical region, the method applies machine learning techniques to extrapolate commonalities in relevant trajectory segments. These commonalities represent historical behavior modes that correspond to the possible future behavior of the selected vessel. Subsequently, the selected vessel is classified to a behavior mode, and a trajectory with respect to this mode is predicted. This is achieved via an initial clustering technique and subsequent trajectory extraction. The extracted trajectories are then compressed using the Karhunen–Loéve transform, and clustered using a Gaussian Mixture Model. The approach in this study differs from others in that trajectories are not clustered for an entire region, but rather for relevant trajectory segments. As such, the extracted trajectories provide a much better basis for clustering relevant historical ship behavior modes. A selected vessel is then classified to one of these modes using its observed behavior. Trajectory predictions are facilitated using an enhanced subset of data that likely correspond to the future behavior of the selected vessel. The method yields promising results, with high classification accuracy and low prediction error. However, vessels with abnormal behavior degrade the results in some situations, and have also been discussed in this study.","Collision avoidance,Unsupervised learning,Trajectory prediction,AIS,Machine learning,Ship navigation,Maritime situation awareness,"
"meteorological regimes modulating dust outbreaks in southwest asia: the role of pressure anomaly and inter-tropical convergence zone on the 1–3 july 2014 case","2015","The present work examines the characteristics (source regions, pathways, vertical profiles) as well as the meteorological conditions and the role of the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) during a dust event on 1–3 July 2014 over southwest (SW) Asia. NCEP/NCAR reanalysis, meteorological and satellite remote sensing (MODIS, Meteosat, CALIPSO) observations are utilized. The major dust storm (AOD550 up to 1.5–2.0) was generated in the southern Karakum desert in Turkmenistan as a result of intense north winds (Levar), due to enhanced pressure gradient between the Caspian Sea and Hindu Kush Mountains. The dust storm was vertically extended up to 5km over the arid terrain of SW Asia, as a consequence of the deep mixing layer and increased convection, while over northern Arabian Sea it was mixed with another dust plume coming from Arabia and marine aerosols due to strong monsoon winds within the boundary layer. The regional topography, variations in pressure, monsoon circulation and the position of the ITCZ play a decisive role on modulation of the wind field, dust-storm pathways and vertical distribution of dust. Enhanced knowledge of atmospheric circulation and processes responsible for dust export over SW Asia and Arabian Sea in linkage to the Levar wind and Indian summer monsoon is essential for improving dust forecasts and simulations over the region.","MSLP anomalies,SW Asia,ITCZ position,Dust storm,Karakum desert,Vertical dust distribution,"

Today the major research programmes study the oceans in four dimensions, since changes with time—daily, seasonal, and year-to-year—are no less important than those in space. Oceanography and meteorology have much in common: the temperature and movement of air and water cannot be directly seen from the ground or sea level, but must be investigated by means of specialised instruments whose readings can be brought back to the observer.",""
"deployment strategies of mobile networks for internet-of-things in smart maritime ports","2022","It is estimated that 80% of world trade is transported via maritime logistic. The maritime trade networks can be seen as a graph with links and nodes. For an optimal network, the links representing the maritime routes must be short (with minimal cost) and secure. The nodes of the network represents the maritime ports, which are hub sending, receiving or switching the goods (in form of containers). The ports has passed from analog to digital ports to make use of IT tools to speed up the process, especially the administrative part. Nowadays, we talk about smart ports that uses data to further speed up the process administratively but also use a full automation to accelerate/optimize the processing of the goods/containers in terminals/quay. Terminal Operation System (TOS) is the main components in these operations. Therefore, the use of Internet-of-Thing (IoT) in TOS a decisive step towards smart ports. In this work, we propose to extend the notion of IoT in other smart domains to be considered in the smart port paradigm, such smart building, smart grid, smart environment monitoring, etc. Furthermore, we study the optimal strategies for the deployment of a performing networking infrastructure, which is the core element in the IoT layered model. Private network based on Long Term Evolution (LTE/4G) has been estimated to be an optimal solution for private enterprise networking in Industry 4.0.

"a prototype gui for unmanned air vehicle mission planning and execution","2014","This paper describes the development of a graphical user interface which provides unique mission control services to unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) operators. The software has two modes of operation, Planning Mode and Execution Mode. In Planning Mode an operator can readily simulate a desired flight plan to determine mission feasibility. Key features of this mode include integration of forecast weather data and interactive trajectory planning. Harsh North Atlantic weather can jeopardize a mission, so running a simulation with predicted wind conditions may greatly reduce the risk of a UAV loss. In Execution Mode the operator can deploy an autonomous vehicle, change the route “on the fly”, hold the aircraft over a point of interest, and return the UAV to home base whenever necessary. In both modes the predicted and actual weather conditions are the key to mission success. All weather data required for these functions is automatically downloaded via the internet. Operation of the software, including interactive trajectory planning, weather observation, mission planning and execution, is achieved through a user-friendly graphical user interface. Simulation results, flight trajectories, and weather data can be saved for further analysis. Comparing missions with and without weather information, it was determined that meteorological information can have a very significant impact on the mission success or failure. In a typical example mission discussed here, including forecast weather conditions increased the UAV's fuel consumption by 18% and mission time by 26%.","airborne surveillance,autonomous vehicles,maritime security,UAV mission planning,graphical user interface,UAV mission control,Unmanned aerial vehicle control,"
"natural and anthropogenic submarine morphologies revealed by high resolution acoustic data in the gulf of izmir, western turkey","2016","This study includes the interpretation of submarine morphological structures using the multibeam echo sounder bathymetry and CHIRP high resolution seismic in the Gulf of Izmir. The faults as the indicator of active tectonics, submarine channels, gas seeps, active and inactive pockmarks are the main natural morphological features in the gulf. Additionally, man-made (anthropogenic) structures like navigation channels, excavation debrises and ships wrecks are also observed. Geomorphological development of the gulf is controlled by the active faults in the Neotectonic period. Therefore, detection of active faults is very critical for the morphology of the gulf where many faults with different orientations have been interpreted on the seismic data. In the central-outer part of the gulf to the W NW, there are some normal faults trending in the N NW and S SE direction, and in the eastern and southern part of the gulf, E–W trending normal faults are evident in the seabed topography. The water depth increases from the eastern (inner) to the outer section of the gulf in the W NW direction. The N NE margin and the coastal area are very shallow (<25 m) because of the Quaternary deltaic sediment influx from the Gediz River. There are several biogenic, shallow gas accumulations in and around the delta of this river. In addition, many active and inactive pockmarks and gas seeps are also observed in the delta sediments and near the active faults as evidence of hydrocarbon generation and seepage.","Gulf of Izmir,Gediz Delta,Uzunada Fault Zone,Chirp,Multibeam echo sounder,"
"climate variability and dengue fever in makassar, indonesia: bayesian spatio-temporal modelling","2020","A range of Bayesian models have been used to describe spatial and temporal patterns of disease in areal unit data. In this study, we applied two Bayesian spatio-temporal conditional autoregressive (ST CAR) models, one of which allows discontinuities in risk between neighbouring areas (creating ‘groups’), to examine dengue fever patterns. Data on annual (2002–2017) and monthly (January 2013 - December 2017) dengue cases and climatic factors over 14 geographic areas were obtained for Makassar, Indonesia. Combinations of covariates and model formulations were compared considering credible intervals, overall goodness of fit, and the grouping structure. For annual data, an ST CAR localised model incorporating average humidity provided the best fit, while for monthly data, a single-group ST CAR autoregressive model incorporating rainfall and average humidity was preferred. Using appropriate Bayesian spatio-temporal models enables identification of different groups of areas and the impact of climatic covariates which may help inform policy decisions.","Bayesian,Spatio-temporal conditional autoregressive,Climatic factors,"
"deep sea archaeological survey in the black sea – robotic documentation of 2,500 years of human seafaring","2019","Between 2015 and 2017 the Black Sea Maritime Archaeology Project (Black Sea MAP) discovered and recorded 65 shipwreck sites dating from the 4th Century BC to the 19th Century AD in the Bulgarian Exclusive Economical Zone (EEZ). Using state-of-the-art remotely operated vehicles to survey the seabed, the team captured more than 250,000 high-definition (HD) photographs; hundreds of hours of ultra high-definition (UHD) video together with acoustic bathymetric, laser, side-scan sonar and seismic data. The wrecks were located in depths from 40 to 2200 m – those shipwrecks in the deeper range presented extraordinary archaeological preservation due to the Black Sea's anoxic conditions. This paper will introduce the range of deep-sea optic and acoustic survey techniques to accurately record and create 3D and pseudo 4D models of the shipwrecks. It will focus on a Early 4th Century BC shipwreck demonstrating the project's survey strategy as well as adaptations developed in response to operational conditions; the implementation of deep sea robotics to generate georeferenced high-resolution photogrammetric models and the benefits this has as an on-site, as well as a post-cruise, interpretative tool. It demonstrates that in-theatre acquisition and processing of high-quality datasets is a working reality and has fundamental implications for management as well as the advantages that this brings to the archaeological research process: Firstly, in the creation of spatio-temporal models, i.e., 4D representations of a site pre and post archaeological excavation and secondly, in monitoring such wreck sites, and provides a viable non-intervention tool for the assessment of sites as part of a long-term management strategy. It also shows the value of well-funded collaboration between academia and industry and that deep water archaeology can and must be totally in accordance to the 2011 United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) convention.","Anoxic preservation,Photogrammetry,Shipwrecks,Black sea,Deep sea archaeology,Underwater robotics,"
"long-term trends in daily extreme air temperature indices in ireland from 1885 to 2018","2022","Long-term instrumental series are crucial to analyse extreme air temperature indices and to examine modern climate warming within a historical context. This research provides the first assessment in Ireland of the frequency, duration, intensity and geographical distribution of the daily extreme air temperature indices recommended by the ETCCDI (Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices) and based on long-term rescued, quality-controlled and homogenised data. Prior analysis of air temperature indices in Ireland had focused on the period since the second half of the 20th century, where digital data were readily available. Earlier estimations of long-term air temperature trends in Ireland focused on non-homogenised data from a small network of stations. For this research, 11 long-term (1885–2018) maximum and minimum air temperature series were analysed to assess seasonal and annual trends and construct extreme air temperature indices in Ireland. The non-parametric Mann-Kendall test was employed to test the statistical significance of the maximum and minimum air temperatures and indices trends (p < 0.05). Significant increasing trends were assessed in the seasonal and annual maximum and minimum air temperature series in Ireland, with greater increases in the spring and autumn seasons. Significant increasing trends were determined in the warm days (+6.8 days), warm nights (+7.5 nights), warm spell duration index (+3.9 days), growing season length (+22 days), coldest night (+2.7 °C) and coldest day (+1.5 °C) in the period 1885–2018 in Ireland. In the same period, significant decreasing trends were identified in the cold days (−9.3 days), cold nights (−7 nights), frost days (−13.7 days), cold spell duration index (−6.9 days) and diurnal air temperature range (−0.1 °C) in Ireland. The results follow global patterns presented in the Six Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The findings of this research will be crucial to assist stakeholders and policymakers in defining climate action, adaptation and mitigation plans in response to shifting trends in air temperature extremes.","Air temperature trends,Historical weather extremes,Ireland,Extreme air temperature indices,Climate change,"

In the proposed representation, the main elements of maritime traffic patterns, such as maneuvering regions and sea-lanes, are represented, respectively, with graph vertices and edges. Vessel motion dynamics are defined by multiple Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes with different long-run mean parameters, which in our approach can be estimated with a change detection procedure based on Page's test, aimed to reveal the spatial points representative of velocity changes. A density-based clustering algorithm is then applied to aggregate the detected changes into groups of similar elements and reject outliers. To validate the proposed graph-based representation of the maritime traffic, two performance criteria are tested against a real-world trajectory dataset collected off the Iberian Coast and the English Channel.

"colregs-compliant unmanned surface vehicles collision avoidance based on improved differential evolution algorithm","2024","Unmanned surface vessel (USV) has a wide range of applications in oceanographic research, resource development, environment detection, and security rescue due to its advantages of maneuverability, flexibility, fast response, and intelligence. The ability of USVs to autonomously and effectively avoid obstacles in highly dynamic and uncertain marine environments is a prerequisite for the successful completion of their tasks. Therefore, in this article, a USV collision avoidance based on International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea and the Collision Risk Model with the Improved Differential Evolution Algorithm (CRI-DE) has been considered. Based on the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGs) and common practices of seafarers, an improved ship collision risk model is proposed. Specifically, the model is innovatively combined with the differential evolution algorithm (DE) as a constraint condition to further realize path planning in complex situations. Moreover, chaotic multi-population parallel optimization, parameter adaptive adjustment strategy, and the construction of fitness function based on individual path points are added to the DE. In this way, the ability to escape from local optima and enrich population diversity can be guaranteed. Finally, experiments based on the proposed CRI-DE are conducted and the results indicate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method.","Collision risk model,Path planning,Multi-ship collision avoidance,Improved differential evolution algorithm,"
"analyzing congestion interdependencies of ports and container ship routes in the maritime network infrastructure","2018","Events, such as prolonged congestion in ports or unavailable ship routes in the maritime network, often initiate cascading congestions that block transportation and/or disrupt services over wide areas. Existing traffic flow analysis methods lack the ability to understand the cascading effects of delays in ship routes or how to reduce overall delays in greater maritime areas. Dependency risk graphs have been proposed as a tool for analyzing such cascading events using dependency chains. This paper proposes a risk-based interdependency analysis method capable to detect large-scale traffic congestions between interconnected ports and ship routes in the maritime network and provide solutions to improve flow. Presented dependency risk chains of ports along with graph theory help us analyze ship routes and detect ports that are affected most when other major ports are congested in the maritime network, detect the causes of bottlenecks, and provide valuable info in relieving delays across container ship routes. We apply the proposed method on historical container ship routing data provided by the MarineTraffic company that maintains a comprehensive maritime database worldwide for more than six million users monthly. This application-oriented, interdisciplinary effort culminated in a prototype tool is able to analyze the historical data for container ships in the entire global maritime network and detect congestion dependencies. The tool can be used to identify key shipping routes or ports that: 1) are prone to delays; 2) greatly affect the overall maritime network due to position, connections and risk of congestion; and/or 3) get affected the most by delays in previous route legs.","maritime database worldwide,cascading effects,Transportation,telecommunication network routing,graph,congestion interdependency analysis,centrality,vehicle routing,interconnected ports,transportation,Marine vehicles,sector,Delays,Mathematical model,Maritime,infrastructure,cascading,delay,Containers,ships,dependency risk chains,container,risk-based interdependency analysis method,dependency,flow,congestion,MarineTraffic company,impact,global maritime network infrastructure,sea ports,historical container ship routing data,containers,traffic flow analysis methods,graph theory,large-scale traffic congestion detection,risk,marine communication,Tools,route,Analytical models,port,"
"a merchant ship thermo-salinograph network in the pacific ocean","1996","The need for better knowledge of sea surface salinity (SSS) and sea surface temperature (SST) distribution in the tropical oceans was brought to light during the 10 years of the TOGA programme (1985–1994). In order to improve on the original “meteorological bucket” method of sampling, we developed a network of merchant ships among those operating regular routes through the tropical Pacific, and equipped them with thermo-salinographs. Accurate positioning of the ships was obtained using a satellite positioning system. High frequency sampling (every 15 s) and recording of the median values for every 5 min resulted in quite precise monitoring of the SST and SSS, and in a description of the salinity fronts along the routes followed by the ships. Using this equipment, we were able to detect the influence of local rainfall on salinity and temperature and the diurnal cycle of sea surface temperature. The accuracy of salinity measurements (0.02) was better than that of the old sampling technique by one order of magnitude. Temperature measurement by the thermo-salinograph was very stable but yielded results that are 0.2–0.3°C higher than sea surface temperature. To ensure reliability of data, the equipment was carefully checked every time the ships called at Noumea (i.e. every 2–3 months), and re-calibration every year or two is essential.",""
"the xiom: 20 years of a regional coastal observatory in the spanish catalan coast","2009","The importance of coasts and the need for improving knowledge of their environment through the observation and modelling of processes is evident from human activities and ecosystems that they support. This paper presents the coastal observatory in the Spanish Catalan coast and its contribution to a better understanding of processes that take place in this area. The XIOM network for oceanographic and coastal meteorological measurements (Xarxa d'Instrumentació Oceanogràfica I Meteorològica) is owned by the Catalan regional government. XIOM buoys collect wave height data at local receiving stations, which is then validated statistically, and the subsequent results are displayed on the website. Water level recordings are based on pressure measurements and atmospheric variables recorded with typical meteorological stations. At present, there is not a continuous measurement of currents or temperatures in the Catalan shelf-slope region, but several moorings have been deployed in the area. The coastal wind field is highly heterogeneous with main components from E, NW and S. This will have some implication for the coastal wind waves. Even with the relatively short fetch in the NW Mediterranean, the Catalan coast can be impacted by damaging waves during storms. At the Ebro delta the complex winds develop bimodal spectral wave features. In the central and north coast typical unimodal spectra are found. The most important variations in sea level in the Catalan coast are due to meteorological conditions and in some areas the resonant effect of bays and harbours. Storm surges may be of the order of 1 m, a magnitude much larger than tidal range. This sea level variation has a very important effect on storm risk and coastal flooding and it is a very important factor when modelling coastal dynamics in extreme events. The continental shelf slope dynamics are dominated by a quasi-permanent slope current. The mean current intensity is not very strong (~10 cm/s at 100 m depth) but it presents a seasonal intensification in winter where velocities can reach higher values. Over the shelf, little work has been previously done over long time series. The measurements obtained allowed the identification of the relative influence of winds, Ebro river outflow and open sea dynamics on the shelf dynamics. An oil spill drift forecasting system has also been developed in which measurements will be used for the short forecast of oil transport. The XIOM is still growing and in a short term period meteorological buoys with current meters will be deployed and scalar buoys will be replaced by directional ones.","Catalan coast,Coastal network,Coastal processes,Coastal observatories,XIOM,"

"cyber-maritime cycle: autonomy of marine robots for ocean sensing","2016","Marine robots are being increasingly deployed in environmental sensing and ocean observation applications. The key challenges in mobile ocean sensing are to design and control the motion of the robots to collect Lagrangian data over a large spatial domain, and then convert these Lagrangian data streams into Eulerian spatial-temporal maps for scientific and operational benefits. This monograph introduces cyber maritime cycle as a collection of feedback loops where the flow of data is regulated by functional blocks of autonomy. As a new development, the split between the data-driven cycle and the geo-scientific modeling cycle allows the separation of data streams with different time and spatial scales. This separation allows the conversion between Lagrangian and Eulerian data representations to happen more frequently for navigation of marine robots. This monograph introduces the overall systems architecture and patterns for data streams that enables autonomy for marine robots towards environmental sensing applications. It is an ideal reference for researchers, students or practitioners already doing research in this field, or planning to do so.",""

"spatial relationship between phytophthora ramorum and roads or streams in oregon tanoak forests","2014","The pathogen, Phytophthora ramorum, causal agent of sudden oak death (SOD) of oaks and tanoaks, continues to expand its range within Oregon despite an effort to eradicate it from native forests. With its early detection and prompt removal of infected hosts, the Oregon SOD eradication program has produced a landscape distribution of disease resulting predominantly from the long distance (100m to 4km) dispersal of inoculum between sites. Using a regionally restricted randomization test reflecting the south to north intensification of the SOD epidemic in Oregon, we assessed if the movement of P. ramorum between sites was spatially dependant upon roads and streams, topographic features associated with the landscape-scale movement of soil and water borne inoculum of related Phytophthora spp. Dissimilar to other forest Phytophthora spp. we found no association between SOD sites and the road network. We did, however, determine that SOD sites are occurring closer to streams than would be expected by chance, especially in regions with microclimates less conducive to establishment. Environmental conditions and/or dispersal mechanisms associated with streams may contribute to the distribution of SOD in Oregon tanoak forests. Monitoring and management should therefore concentrate on susceptible forests in close proximity to streams, especially in stands further inland from a coastal climate.","Sudden oak death,Spatial spread,Invasive pathogen,Forest pathology,Restricted randomization,"
"eeg-based maritime object detection for iot-driven surveillance systems in smart ocean","2020","Automated maritime object detection is a significant research challenge in intelligent marine surveillance systems for the Internet of Things (IoT) and smart ocean applications. In particular, ship detection is recognized as one of the core research issues of these IoT-driven intelligent marine surveillance systems. Traditional methods based on machine learning have made some achievements in detection tasks for specific objects. However, the ship objects are relatively small, and they are usually not accurately detected. In this article, we propose an electroencephalography (EEG)-based maritime object detection algorithm for IoT-driven surveillance systems in the smart ocean. For this purpose, we conduct experiments to record the EEG signals of subjects when they are watching the maritime image scenes. With the feature analysis of EEG signals, the event-related potential (ERP) components associated with detecting objects are induced, such as the  $P3$  and  $N2$  components. Employing classification based on linear discriminant analysis (LDA), the area under curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) is used to evaluate the detection accuracy. We use this novel method to determine and identify essential objects and areas from IoT devices, such as digital camera imaging sensors. Our proposed method can not only help to detect small objects accurately using fewer samples but can also be used to reduce the data volume needed to be stored and transmitted in IoT-driven marine surveillance systems.","medical signal processing,surveillance,Electroencephalography,Electroencephalography (EEG),Internet of Things (IoT),ship detection,Internet of Things,Marine vehicles,maritime image scenes,Feature extraction,smart ocean applications,IoT-driven intelligent marine surveillance systems,maritime object detection,automated maritime object detection,ships,electroencephalography-based maritime object detection algorithm,Oceans,object detection,feature extraction,intelligent surveillance systems,IoT-driven marine surveillance systems,IoT devices,image sensors,smart ocean,Object detection,Surveillance,learning (artificial intelligence),electroencephalography,"
"late quaternary hydroclimatology of a hyper-arid andean watershed: climate change, floods, and hydrologic responses to the el niño-southern oscillation in the atacama desert","2008","Although certain characteristics of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) are well known on contemporary timescales, less is known about the magnitude–frequency relationships of this atmospheric phenomenon on longer timescales or its relationship to widespread flooding, especially in its core zone along the sub-tropical Andes where La Niña or El Niño episodes control regional hydroclimatology. Using a combination of stratigraphic evidence, geochronologic dating (14C and OSL), stable isotope analyses, and water geochemistry along the Rio Moquegua in the northern fringes of the Atacama Desert, we assemble a paleoflood chronology for mainstem and tributary sections for the past ca. 20 ka and ascertain the variation in ENSO frequency and magnitude. Because of the inherent watershed structure and regional hydroclimatology, mid-valley tributaries of the Rio Moquegua only flood during El Niño episodes and thus provide an important proxy of extreme El Niños while mainstem stratigraphy records both La Niña and El Niño episodes. El Niño floods appear to have been pronounced during the Late Pleistocene and up to at least the Younger Dryas (~12,000 cal yr BP) while stratigraphic evidence of large El Niño floods is lacking in tributary systems during the Mid-Holocene. Flood stratigraphy in a ~2 ka 7 m high terrace along the mainstem indicates an increased frequency and magnitude of large floods between ca. 700 and 1610 AD as compared to the period from ca. 160 BCE to 700 AD with “mega-Niños” occurring ca. 1330 AD and ca. 1650 AD. Water geochemistry and radiocarbon dating indicate that at least two major aquifers exist, with wells and springs in the mid-valley dating to 710 and 3100 14C yr BP, respectively, while water from a spring in the headwaters dates to 10,320 14C yr BP. This range in dates suggests that groundwater flow in the mid-valley is neither fossil water nor exclusively recharged from local precipitation while the older date for headwater sections suggests a more fossil groundwater source and lack of contemporary recharge. The 18O similarity between groundwater in the mid-valley and the regional meteoric water line (MWL) suggests a Pacific moisture source and the role of El Niño precipitation in recharging local aquifers. Thus, El Niños and Pacific-sourced moisture are an important component of the regional hydroclimatology and the variation in ENSO frequency and intensity has significant social and hydrologic repercussions in these hyper-arid settings.","Andes,Floods,El Niño,Tiwanaku,Isotopes,Climate change,"
"efficient distributed maximum matching for solving the container exchange problem in the maritime industry","2015","To reduce container management costs, ocean carrier companies rent containers from container leasing companies. Two carrier companies can exchange their empty containers between each other at various ports to eliminate the transportation cost of empty containers. To minimize costs, a container leasing company has to find the maximum number of pairs of carrier companies that can exchange containers. We formulate this problem as maximum matching in a large general graph, and propose a distributed matching algorithm to solve this problem. We also propose several optimization techniques to improve the efficiency of our algorithm.","Transportation,cargo transportation,optimization techniques,ocean carrier companies,Ports (Computers),transportation,Companies,container leasing company,transportation cost,Distributed maximum matching,container management costs,container exchange problem,distributed maximum matching algorithm,Containers,Servers,Oceans,optimisation,large general graph,containers,graph theory,Bipartite graph,reachability,freight handling,maritime industry,cost minimization,iterative multiple BSP,cost reduction,"
"initiation of a severe thunderstorm over the mediterranean sea","2011","The Mediterranean basin is regularly affected by severe weather associated with deep convection. Although convective systems are usually linked to coastal orography, some severe thunderstorms develop and mature over the sea. A recent example is the severe thunderstorm that affected the island of Mallorca in the afternoon of 4 October 2007. The storm formed early in the morning offshore of Murcia, and steadily became organized into a squall line. Arriving in Palma city, this squall line produced severe gusts, heavy rain and several tornadoes. The initiation and evolution of convection in these kinds of maritime events depend on both synoptic and mesoscale features. Representing such interactions is a challenge for numerical weather prediction. The aim of this study is to determine the prominent factors involved in the initiation and evolution of the damaging squall line, by means of high resolution numerical experiments. We also focus on squall line mesovortices to explain the potential for tornado development and the role of Mallorcan orography on their evolution. Simulations performed with the mesoscale model Méso-NH allowed relevant mechanisms for initiation and development of the strong squall line to be identified. The squall line initiates in an area with conditional instability, characterized by a cut-off and a southerly jet aloft and by moist, warm air at low-levels along a front. In addition, the area of low-level convergence offshore of Murcia, associated with the front and enhanced by a low downstream of the Atlas range, was shown to be crucial during the early stage of the convective system. The dry layer in the mid-troposphere and the strong sheared environment provide elements for understanding the development of such a damaging squall line. Moreover, a very high resolution experiment (600m mesh) gave a very realistic representation of the squall line, including mesovortices ahead of the gust front, which confirmed the potential of this strong convective system for the genesis of small-scale vortices that may precede tornado development. A sensitivity experiment pointed out the prominent role of Mallorcan orography in straightening mesovortices approaching Palma city, and provided interesting elements for the understanding of the localization of tornadoes that occurred on 4 October 2007.","Bow echo,Mesovortices,Mediterranean convection,"

"a fast sar image position algorithm for maritime target location","2016","In order to find the maritime targets location in SAR image accurately, a fast R-D algorithm is introduced in this paper and it can solve targets location problems which are in the sea area. The real latitude and longitude coordinates measure system and geographical coordinates are built up for SAR image, then the targets located in the sea can be point out. First, based on information in SAR satellite data headers the Doppler center frequency coefficients can be calculated. Then the parameters are carried in the R-D pattern for calculate four vertex coordinates of SAR image. Generally the solution of R-D pattern is an iterative process, here a fast algorithm is proposed which combined with slope distance, Doppler parameters and earth model to reduce variables, then and the position of SAR is calculated and the latitude and longitude coordinates of target is also obtained. Second, the SAR image geocoding can be made up and the target in SAR image over sea can be found out. Finally, compare these results with AIS data, the accuracy of location is analyzed. The result shows that the deviation of distance location is less than 200 meters, and the deviation of azimuth is less than 6'. The error is reasonable for real application.

"altimetry for the future: building on 25 years of progress","2021","In 2018 we celebrated 25 years of development of radar altimetry, and the progress achieved by this methodology in the fields of global and coastal oceanography, hydrology, geodesy and cryospheric sciences. Many symbolic major events have celebrated these developments, e.g., in Venice, Italy, the 15th (2006) and 20th (2012) years of progress and more recently, in 2018, in Ponta Delgada, Portugal, 25 Years of Progress in Radar Altimetry. On this latter occasion it was decided to collect contributions of scientists, engineers and managers involved in the worldwide altimetry community to depict the state of altimetry and propose recommendations for the altimetry of the future. This paper summarizes contributions and recommendations that were collected and provides guidance for future mission design, research activities, and sustainable operational radar altimetry data exploitation. Recommendations provided are fundamental for optimizing further scientific and operational advances of oceanographic observations by altimetry, including requirements for spatial and temporal resolution of altimetric measurements, their accuracy and continuity. There are also new challenges and new openings mentioned in the paper that are particularly crucial for observations at higher latitudes, for coastal oceanography, for cryospheric studies and for hydrology. The paper starts with a general introduction followed by a section on Earth System Science including Ocean Dynamics, Sea Level, the Coastal Ocean, Hydrology, the Cryosphere and Polar Oceans and the “Green” Ocean, extending the frontier from biogeochemistry to marine ecology. Applications are described in a subsequent section, which covers Operational Oceanography, Weather, Hurricane Wave and Wind Forecasting, Climate projection. Instruments’ development and satellite missions’ evolutions are described in a fourth section. A fifth section covers the key observations that altimeters provide and their potential complements, from other Earth observation measurements to in situ data. Section 6 identifies the data and methods and provides some accuracy and resolution requirements for the wet tropospheric correction, the orbit and other geodetic requirements, the Mean Sea Surface, Geoid and Mean Dynamic Topography, Calibration and Validation, data accuracy, data access and handling (including the DUACS system).

"a comprehensive survey on security, privacy issues and emerging defence technologies for uavs","2023","In the past two decades, there has been a rapid development in the drone industry known as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Currently, the use of commercial UAVs has increased a lot due to their affordability, but lack of security implementations has introduced many threats and vulnerabilities in UAVs. In addition, software, and hardware complexity in UAVs also triggers privacy and security issues as well as causes critical challenges for government, industry and academia. Firstly, in this research review, we broadly survey privacy and security issues of UAVs by dividing them into three classes: Software, Hardware and Communication. Particularly, for each class, we systematically survey the common vulnerabilities causing potential attacks to UAVs. Secondly, a review of prevailing threats that are threatening civilian UAVs’ applications is also a part of this survey. Thirdly, a comprehensive discussion of passive and active attacks from adversaries, for compromising privacy and security of UAVs is given as well. Fourthly, we provide detail description of existing mitigation techniques and countermeasures, to protect UAVs. Fifthly, the solution architecture part includes discussion about emerging technologies such as, blockchain usage, machine learning, intrusion detection systems and secure communication protocols. To store all data in transit, blockchain can be used cryptographically and protect it from eavesdropping and tampering. In this research review, key points that highlighted the lessons learned about security and privacy of UAVs are also summarized. Lastly, the survey is concluded by discussing important pitfalls as well as suggestions for future research directions, concerning privacy and security of UAVs.","Vulnerabilities,Intrusion detection system,Blockchain,Digital forensic,Cyber security and privacy,Adversarial machine learning,"

"incorporating discrete unmanned maritime system data collections into ncei synthesized data products","2020","In recent years, Unmanned Maritime Systems (UMS) have become widely used in hydrographic surveys and oceanographic studies, especially in coastal regions. NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) has received an increased amount of data collected by UMS in the past 10 years. A variety of different types of data are typically collected simultaneously by UMS, which raises questions about the best practices for UMS data management. In this manuscript, we discuss enhancing the value of UMS data through integration into NCEI synthesized products. These products range from data-type specific databases like the Surface Underway Marine Database, and the World Ocean Database to analyses (value-added) products such as climatological mean fields and ocean time series of variables such as ocean heat and oxygen content. Data from Saildrones and Wave Glider missions demonstrate how data collected by Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USV) are integrated into the Surface Underway Marine Database. The integration of data from Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUV) systems - such as gliders - into the World Ocean Database is also described. Data management procedures and quality controls are discussed. The application of standardized methods adds long-term value to the original UMS, and improves the quality and reliability of the synthesized products.

"potential of stochastic methods for improving convection-permitting ensemble forecasts of extreme events over the western mediterranean","2021","The design of convection-permitting ensemble prediction systems capable of producing accurate forecasts of disruptive events is an extraordinarily challenging effort. The difficulties associated with the detection of extreme events found at these scales motivates the research of methodologies that efficiently sample relevant uncertainties. This study investigates the potential of multiple techniques to account for model uncertainty. The performance of various stochastic schemes is assessed for an exceptional heavy precipitation episode which occurred in eastern Spain. In particular, the stochastic strategies are compared to a multiphysics approach in terms of both spread and skill. The analyzed techniques include stochastic parameterization perturbation tendency and perturbations to influential parameters within the microphysics scheme. The introduction of stochastic perturbations to the microphysics processes results in a larger ensemble spread throughout the entire simulation. Conversely, modifications to microphysics parameters generate small-scale perturbations that rapidly grow over areas with high convective instability, in contrast to the other methods, which produce more widespread perturbations. A conclusion of specific interest for the western Mediterranean, where deep moist convection and local orography play an important role, is that stochastic methods are shown to outperform a multiphysics-based ensemble for this case, indicating the potential positive impact of stochastic parameterizations for the forecast of extreme events in the region.","Microphysics,Ensemble prediction systems,Stochastic parameterization,Western Mediterranean,Heavy precipitation episodes,"

"lagrangian analysis of multi-satellite data in support of open ocean marine protected area design","2017","Compared to ecosystem conservation in territorial seas, protecting the open ocean has peculiar geopolitical, economic and scientific challenges. One of the major obstacle is defining the boundary of an open ocean Marine Protected Area (MPA). In contrast to coastal ecosystems, which are mostly constrained by topographic structures fixed in time, the life of marine organisms in the open ocean is entrained by fluid dynamical structures like eddies and fronts, whose lifetime occurs on ecologically-relevant timescales. The position of these highly dynamical structures can vary interannually by hundreds of km, and so too will regions identified as ecologically relevant such as the foraging areas of marine predators. Thus, the expected foraging locations suggested from tracking data cannot be directly extrapolated beyond the year in which the data were collected. Here we explore the potential of Lagrangian methods applied to multisatellite data as a support tool for a MPA proposal by focusing on the Crozet archipelago oceanic area (Indian Sector of the Southern Ocean). By combining remote sensing with biologging information from a key marine top predator (Eudyptes chrysolophus, or Macaroni penguin) of the Southern Ocean foodweb, we identify a highly dynamic branch of the Subantarctic front as a foraging hotspot. By tracking this feature in historical satellite data (1993–2012) we are able to extrapolate the position of this foraging ground beyond the years in which tracking data are available and study its spatial variability.",""

"modelling fire perimeter formation in the canadian rocky mountains","2022","Wildfires produce a mosaic of burned and unburned patches across varying temporal and spatial scales and provide a range of essential ecosystem services. Fire perimeters mark the separation between the burned and unburned matrix of a fire. Analysis of fire perimeters in the United States, Australia, and Alberta, have identified several key factors that influence the formation of a fire boundary, including fire environment variables, such as fuel, weather, and topographic conditions, as well as anthropogenic factors. We used matched case-control conditional logistic regression to assess the fire environment's influence on the formation of fire boundaries on the 2017 Verdant Creek Fire in the western Canadian Rocky Mountain region. Results indicated that fire boundary formation was strongly influenced by non-fuels, alpine and subalpine vegetation, wetland areas, and low and sparse shrub assemblages generally associated with avalanche paths. Fire cessation was more likely near waterways; however, the fire weather conditions that characterized most burning periods likely overrode other topographic influences. Fire cessation was most likely to occur one day following precipitation events when Vapour Pressure Deficit and Fire Weather Index values decreased. To explore the potential influence of spatial data resolution and fire mapping limitations on our results, we varied the distance between matched sample points selected on each side of the mapped fire perimeter during statistical modelling. Results demonstrated matched pairs of burned and unburned sample points were effective at representing discrete states when separated by at least 100 m and that insufficient or excessive separation between matched pairs confounds results, highlighting the importance of sensitivity analysis for determining the appropriate separation distance to represent burned and unburned states. We demonstrate a practical application of the model to predict spread potential, enabling rapid visual assessment of landscape locations most likely to limit fire spread.","Spatial analysis,Rocky Mountain forests,Wildland fire,Risk analysis,Fire extinguishment,Matched case-control conditional logistic regression,"

"holocene surface hydroclimate changes in the indo-pacific warm pool","2018","The Indo-Pacific warm pool (IPWP) is an area hosting key tropical climate processes such as the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD). The tropical climate processes, via various feedback mechanisms, control the surface ocean climate in the Indian Ocean and its surrounding continents on annual to inter-annual timescales. However, little has been known about how the tropical processes are effective forcing climate mechanism over longer timescales. Here we presented a reconstruction of the spatiotemporal pattern of sea surface temperature (SST) with inferred hydroclimate changes since the early Holocene (∼11ka), using proxies of planktonic foraminifer shell Mg/Ca, organic biomarker (TEX86), foraminifer oxygen isotopes, and a terrigenous BIT index measured from a 220 cm long Core BS24 (2.724041°N, 97.010943°E, 1015 m water depth) which was taken offshore of northwest Sumatra in the eastern Indian Ocean. With an age model of 13 AMS 14C dating by the uses of planktonic foraminiferal shells from the core, the TEX86H temperatures of BS24 show as summer-weighted, and reflect integrated thermal effects from the surface to thermocline water, while the Mg/Ca temperature of BS24 better reflects mean annual SST. Our results, along with a regional synthesis of published SST records from the IPWP, suggest that the IPWP has migrated eastwardly since the mid-Holocene (∼5ka). In phase with this eastward migration, the IPWP SSTs have decreased, but the upwelling in the eastern Indian Ocean appears to have been a persistent feature since the mid-Holocene. Our Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis on the compiled IPWP SST records indicates two dominant modes of spatio-temporal variability of surface hydrographes in the IPWP that are attributed to a combined effect of orbital and solar forcing, with expressions analogous to the Indian ocean basin-wide mode (IOBM) and the Indian Ocean dipole model (IOD).","SST,Quaternary,Indo-Pacific warm pool,Mg/Ca,Organic biomarker,TEX,Surface circulation,Monsoon,"
"shallow electrical resistivity imaging of the limón fault, chagres river watershed, panama canal","2017","The aim of this study was the use of electrical resistivity imaging to investigate the geometry of the southwest portion of one of the most important geologic fault zones of the Panama Canal Watershed: the Limón fault. This fault is characterized by its juxtaposition of pre-Tertiary andesitic basalt (Playa Venado Formation) against late Oligocene Tertiary sediments (Caimito Formation). In this zone, four 2D electrical resistivity tomography profiles were conducted perpendicular to the fault trace: T-1, T-2, T-3 and T-4. The T-1, T-3, and T-4 profiles were long profiles (235m for the first two and 215m for the last one), with a goal of determining the depth of the geologic boundary between the sedimentary and andesitic deposits. The T-2 profile was a short profile (23.5m), with the objective of calibrating the results with data provided by the paleoseismic trenching previously developed in the area of interest. For these tests, two electrode arrays of types Wenner-Schlumberger and Dipole-Dipole, were used. For the inversion routine, two regularized least-squares methods were used: the smoothness-constrained method and robust inversion. The long electrical resistivity tomography profiles were able to identify a set of electrical anomalies associated with the andesitic basalt and the Tertiary sediments and with that, the contact geometry between these formations. In these profiles, fault angle measurements ranged from 60° to 80° with respect to the ground surface. In the T-2 profile, the electrical anomalies showed a good association with the results of the paleoseismic study. This allowed identification of the colluvium and alluvium covering the gravel and sand debris that mark the gradual transition to the soils of the Caimito Formation. Finally, a set of 2D synthetic models was developed for each of the T-1, T-3, and T-4 profiles with the objective of optimizing interpretation of the field results.","Panama,Paleoseismology,Limón fault,Playa Venado Formation,Caimito Formation,Electrical resistivity tomography (ERT),"

"an ais-based deep learning framework for regional ship behavior prediction","2021","This study presents a deep learning framework to support regional ship behavior prediction using historical AIS data. The framework is meant to aid in proactive collision avoidance, in order to enhance the safety of maritime transportation systems. In this study, it is suggested to decompose the historical ship behavior in a given geographical region into clusters. Each cluster will contain trajectories with similar behavior characteristics. For each unique cluster, the method generates a local model to describe the local behavior in the cluster. In this manner, higher fidelity predictions can be facilitated compared to training a model on all available historical behavior. The study suggests to cluster historical trajectories using a variational recurrent autoencoder and the Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise algorithm. The past behavior of a selected vessel is then classified to the most likely clusters of behavior based on the softmax distribution. Each local model consists of a sequence-to-sequence model with attention. When utilizing the deep learning framework, a user inputs the past trajectory of a selected vessel, and the framework outputs the most likely future trajectories. The model was evaluated using a geographical region as a test case, with successful results.","Collision avoidance,Deep learning,Maritime safety,Trajectory prediction,AIS,Ship navigation,Maritime situation awareness,"
"mkcl: medical knowledge with contrastive learning model for radiology report generation","2023","Automatic radiology report generation has the potential to alert inexperienced radiologists to misdiagnoses or missed diagnoses and improve healthcare delivery efficiency by reducing the documentation workload of radiologists. Motivated by the continuous development of automatic image captioning, more and more deep learning methods have been proposed for automatic radiology report generation. However, the visual and textual data bias problem still face many challenges in the medical domain. Additionally, do not integrate medical knowledge, ignoring the mutual influences between medical findings, and abundant unlabeled medical images influence the accuracy of generating report. In this paper, we propose a Medical Knowledge with Contrastive Learning model (MKCL) to enhance radiology report generation. The proposed model MKCL uses IU Medical Knowledge Graph (IU-MKG) to mine the relationship among medical findings and improve the accuracy of identifying positive diseases findings from radiologic medical images. In particular, we design Knowledge Enhanced Attention (KEA), which integrates the IU-MKG and the extracted chest radiological visual features to alleviate textual data bias. Meanwhile, this paper leverages supervised contrastive learning to relieve radiographic medical images which have not been labeled, and identify abnormalities from images. Experimental results on the public dataset IU X-ray show that our proposed model MKCL outperforms other state-of-the-art report generation methods. Ablation studies also demonstrate that IU medical knowledge graph module and supervised contrastive learning module enhance the ability of the model to detect the abnormal parts and accurately describe the abnormal findings.

The multivariate statistical method Factor Analysis (S-mode and T-mode) is applied on the mean intra-annual variation of lightning in order to reveal: i) the main modes of intra-annual variation of lighting activity that correspond to specific sub-regions of the Greek area and ii) the main characteristic patterns of strokes prevailing during specific periods of the year (“seasons”). According to the results there are three main modes of intra-annual variation: a) the continental one with maximum lightning activity in early summer, b) the Ionian Sea one with maximum in early autumn and c) the Aegean Sea one with maxima in middle autumn and late May. Also, according to the patterns of strokes, three main “seasons” are found: a) the summer one (early May–middle August) with highest lightning activity over the continental regions of the country due to the atmospheric instability associated with the intense land heating and the persistence of cool upper air masses, b) the winter one (middle December–middle February) with the maximum of lightning activity over the sea where instability is high due to the frequent prevalence of cold air masses over the warm sea-surface and the associated passages of Mediterranean depressions and c) the autumn one (early September–middle October) with maximum over northwestern Greece associated with the early cold season low pressure systems, the warm sea body of Ionian Sea and the essential role of topography.",""
"grid size optimization for potential field based maritime anomaly detection","2014","This study focuses on improving the potential field based maritime data modeling method, developed to extract traffic patterns and detect anomalies, in a clear, understandable and informative way. The method's novelty lies in employing the concept of a potential field for AIS vessel tracking data abstraction and maritime traffic representation. Unlike the traditional maritime surveillance equipment, such as radar or GPS, the AIS system comprehensively represents the identity and properties of a vessel, as well as its behavior, thus preserving the effects of navigational decisions, based on the skills of experienced seamen. In the developed data modeling process, every vessel generates potential charges, which value represent the vessel's behavior, and drops the charges at locations it passes. Each AIS report is used to assign a potential charge at the reported vessel positions. The method derives three construction elements, which define, firstly, how charges are accumulated, secondly, how a charge decays over time, and thirdly, in what way the potential is distributed around the source charge. The collection of potential fields represents a model of normal behavior, and vessels not conforming to it are marked as anomalous. In the anomaly detection prototype system STRAND, the sensitivity of anomaly detection can be modified by setting a geographical coordinate grid precision to more dense or coarse. The objective of this study is to identify the optimal grid size for two different conditions – an open sea and a port area case. A noticeable shift can be observed between the results for the open sea and the port area. The plotted detection rates converge towards an optimal ratio for smaller grid sizes in the port area (60-200 meters), than in the open sea case (300-1000 meters). The effective outcome of the potential filed based anomaly detection is filtering out all vessels behaving normally and presenting a set of anomalies, for a subsequent incident analysis using STRAND as an information visualization tool.","maritime traffic,potential field,anomaly detection,AIS,"

"research on oil transportation network of maritime silk road based on big data","2020","With the increasing demand for oil in various countries, the study of the spatial pattern of maritime oil transportation become the new focus. Based on the AIS trajectory data of 2014, this paper constructs the oil transportation network of the MSR and analyzes the topological structure and spatial pattern of the oil transportation network of the MSR by applying the complex network theory. The study finds: The oil transportation network of the MSR exhibits the characteristics of the small-world and scale-free as a whole; The space difference of degree and degree distribution is large, and the network centrality shows a trend of decreasing scale and stratification; In the oil transport network, the ports who have the three largest centralities are all the Jurong Port, which has the highest overall centrality and is in the absolute core position; The top 10 ports of the three centralities are basically similar, with only a slight difference in the position order. Most of them are distributed in ASEAN, West Asia and Western Europe, which have strong maritime transportation strength, larger maritime transportation radiation range and superior geographical location.","maritime oil transportation,oil transportation network,transportation,superior geographical location,West Asia,Maritime Silk Road,complex network theory,complex network,Oils,Asia,ASEAN,oil transport network,socio-economic effects,Artificial intelligence,Complex networks,geographic information systems,Roads,Trajectory,tanker trajectory,Western Europe,AIS trajectory data,"
"comparison of new technologies for data exchange in the maritime hf frequency band","2013","Recently, the use of HF radiotelex on ships, as the only terrestrial communication system for data exchange has been kept to a minimum, and the need for alternative systems, which would use the existing HF communication channels to exchange data between ships and end users on land, arose. Satellite communication systems represent the main aid for the exchange of large amounts of data with high transmission rates, but at high costs of equipment and services. Hence, there is the need to explore new, simpler and cheaper technologies for data exchange, which could be an alternative or a substitute for the existing radiotelex system. In this paper, a detailed analysis of the two systems, which could easily replace the existing maritime NBDP (Narrow-Band Direct Printing) telegraphy, has been done. One of the systems is based on the OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplex) protocol, while the other, on the PACTOR-III protocol. The systems were compared on the basis of the various relevant parameters, such as the modulation method, data rate, etc. The analysis results can be used in the selection of the optimal data exchange system with respect to the specific features of maritime communications.","narrow-band direct printing telegraphy,HF radiotelex system,Marine vehicles,data exchange,OFDM modulation,satellite communication,data communication,PACTOR-III protocol,ships,HF communication channels,orthogonal frequency division multiplex protocol,OFDM,protocols,maritime HF frequency band,NBDP,Bandwidth,terrestrial communication system,marine communication,telegraphy,maritime communications,Protocols,satellite communication systems,Frequency shift keying,"
"chapter 10 - wine laws, authentication, and geography","2020","Wine production, like that of any modern product, is regulated by a variety of statutes designed largely to protect the consumer but also the producer. This is especially so relative to wine. Because these dictates vary considerably from country to country, only the basic concepts associated with appellation control laws are described, in terms of their relevance to terroir protection. Details are provided for several major wine regions. As laws are effective only to the degree to which they are enforced and compliance can be verified, the methods by which wine provenance can be validated, and compliance with other statutes detected, are examined. This leads into a discussion of the climatic, soil, varietal, viticultural, and enologic features that distinguish European, African, Asian, Oceanian, and South and North American wine-producing regions.","Wine fraud detection and wine regions,Appellation control laws,"
"mitigating threats of small vessels to maritime security","2012","This paper discusses technology solutions that may be used to mitigate potential threats and security risks arising from small vessels operating in a busy urban maritime domain such as the New York / New Jersey maritime domain. The solutions focus on persistent surveillance by detecting, tracking, and classifying small vessels, and address the risk posed by these vessels. In a series of experiments conducted in the Hudson River, we collected and analyzed data from various sensors and evaluated several potential technology solutions for detecting these security threats. The threats are addressed across multiple scenarios, ranging from man-made threats to coastal hazards, using assets including radars; acoustic and infrared sensors; vessels and vehicles; and oceanographic and meteorologic prediction tools focused on the water surface, underwater, and urban environments. The results of our experiments show that the combination of sensors provides a valuable means to identify small vessels that may pose a threat in a busy harbor.","Satellites,security threats,New York/New Jersey maritime domain,urban security,radar detection,acoustic sensors,maritime security,infrared sensors,underwater,radars,small vessel detection,security risks,Hudson river,Rivers,marine safety,small vessel tracking,man-made threats,small vessel threats,persistent surveillance,busy urban maritime domain,small vessel classification,Radar tracking,port security,coastal hazards,Acoustics,oceanographic prediction tools,water surface,urban environments,radar tracking,multiple scenarios,infrared detectors,Sensors,threat mitigation,acoustic transducers,Security,meteorologic prediction tools,"
"a digital and non-destructive integrated methodology for heritage modelling and deterioration mapping. the case study of the moorish castle in sintra","2023","The development of non-destructive, non-contact and autonomous unmanned techniques is extremely important for the preservation of heritage integrity. This paper presents a digital integrated methodology combining Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS), Aerial Digital Photogrammetry (ADP) and Infrared Thermography (IRT), which accelerate data collection and facilitate the creation of point clouds, the deterioration mapping and the state of conservation monitoring of historic structures. Both Digital Photogrammetry and Infrared Thermography were coupled with unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The proposed methodology was applied to the Moorish Castle in Sintra, Portugal. Manual Infrared Thermography, complemented with other traditional non-destructive techniques, were also applied in a pilot area for comparison purposes.

"graphstgan: situation understanding network of slow-fast high maneuvering targets for maritime monitor services of iot data","2023","With the rapid growth of the maritime internet of things (IoT) devices for maritime monitor services (MMS), maritime traffic controllers could not handle a massive amount of data in time. For unmanned MMS, one of the key technologies is situation understanding. However, the complex motion of sea surface targets, the presence of slow-fast high maneuvering targets and track breakages due to radar blind zones make modeling the dynamics of marine multi-agents difficult, and pose significant challenges to maritime situation understanding. In order to comprehend the situation accurately and thus offer unmanned MMS, it is crucial to model the complex dynamics of multi-agents using IoT big data. Nevertheless, previous methods typically rely on complex assumptions, are plagued by unstructured data, and disregard the interactions between multiple agents and the spatial-temporal correlations. A deep learning model-Graph neural Spatial-Temporal GAN (GraphSTGAN) Network is proposed in this paper, which uses graph neural network to model unstructured data and uses STGAN to learn the spatial-temporal dependencies and the interaction. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method.","Maritime monitoring services,Multi-agents,Graph neural network,Internet of things,"
"chapter 5 - time series analysis methods","2014","This chapter covers all aspects of time series analysis. In this latest edition, the material has been reorganized so that it now starts with basic concepts regarding stochastic processes and introduces correlation functions as the first step toward defining spectral analysis. We examine the application of spectral analysis to stochastic series and discrete series, and provide a thorough treatment of traditional spectral methods. The chi-squared property of spectral estimates is introduced and discussed as a means of evaluating the statistical significance of spectral estimates. Spectral methods for vector series are briefly discussed, as are rotary spectral estimation methods. The effects of temporal or spatial sampling on the resultant spectral estimates are explored and the resultant aliasing is introduced and discussed, as are the implications for frequency resolution. The smoothing of spectral estimates, or windowing, is described and the implications of window selection on the significance of spectral estimates are examined. Simple band averaging is discussed as a smoothing method and the resultant confidence intervals for the spectrum are introduced. The concepts of spectral fidelity and stability are discussed as outcomes of smoothing decisions. The needs for zero padding and prewhitening are then introduced. Next the spectral analysis of unevenly spaced series is a unique topic of this chapter. It also provides a summary of the standard spectral analysis approach. The discussion then shifts to parametric methods of spectral analysis starting with autoregressive power spectral estimation. The maximum entropy spectral method is then introduced along with maximum likelihood spectral estimation. Next is cross-spectral analysis, where we no longer have strict power spectra but must deal with coherence and phase. The Fourier transform method is introduced and the practical applications of this method are detailed. Phase and cross-amplitude functions are discussed along with co- and quadrature spectra. The unique aspects of confidence levels to cross-spectra are then introduced. The frequency response of a linear system is described, along with rotary cross-spectra. Wavelet analysis is subsequently introduced as an alternative to standard spectral methods. Various wavelet algorithms are examined relative to their advantages and disadvantages. Oceanographic examples are presented to show how wavelet analysis can be used. In addition to wavelets the S-transform is discussed along with the multiple filter technique developed by geophysicists. Basic Fourier spectral analysis is then introduced to take advantage of the popular Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) now possible with digital computing facilities. FFT applications to both discrete and continuous time/space series are discussed and detailed. A least-squares FFT method is introduced again as a way of handling gappy time/space series. Computational examples are included with all of these procedures. A discussion of the harmonic analysis as applied to tidal time series is then presented. In earlier editions of this text harmonic analysis was presented before the discussion of spectral methods but the authors now consider harmonic analysis as a subset of the larger spectral analysis and hence it comes later. Computational tidal examples are included here. Special time series methods such as “regime shift detection” (including “sequential t-test analysis of regime shifts,” “adaptive Kolmogorov–Zurbenko filters,” and “cumulative upwelling index”) are introduced and discussed. Vector regression is also suggested as a time series analysis method. Fractals are suggested as another technique to decompose a time series.","Regime shift detection,Spectral windows,Wavelet analysis,Cross-spectral analysis,Fourier analysis,Tidal analysis,Spectral filters,Aliasing,Spectral smoothing,Vector regression,FFT,Fractals,Co- and quadrature spectra,Band averaging,Least-squares spectral analysis,Spectral analysis,Harmonic analysis,"
"effect of biomass burning on premature mortality associated with long-term exposure to pm2.5 in equatorial asia","2023","The health burden from exposure to ambient fine particulates (PM2.5) in Equatorial Asia is substantially affected by the peatland fires in Indonesia, but the long-term health effect of the fires on local inhabitants is unclear. In this study, PM2.5-associated excess mortality in Equatorial Asia over the past 30 years (1990–2019) was estimated and then the health effect of biomass burning was identified. The PM2.5-related death in Equatorial Asia almost tripled from 113 (95% confidence interval, 100–125) thousand in 1990 to 337 (300–373) thousand in 2019, with a rate of increase of 6.4 (6.2–6.9) thousand/yr. The intense biomass burning between 1990 and 2019 was estimated to have induced 317 (282–348) thousand excess deaths in the study regions, with excess deaths mainly occurring in the El Niño years, such as in 1997, 2006, 2015 and 2019. Although the remote sensing data and emission inventories both reveal that the effective control measures have reduced biomass burning intensity in Equatorial Asia (especially in Sumatra and Borneo), the corresponding health benefit has been offset by variations in demographic factors, i.e., population and age structure. Over the same period, fossil fuel emissions continued to increase rapidly. Thus, more stringent and ambitious policies are required to reduce the health burden from biomass burning and anthropogenic emissions simultaneously to maximize the health benefits from government measures and policies.","Population ageing,Emission inventory,El Niño,Remote sensing,Global exposure mortality model (GEMM),"

Next, the chapter deals with the features of oceanography including sound speed profiles, thermoclines, arctic regions, deep isothermal layers, expressions for the speed of sound, surface waves, internal waves, bubbles from wave breaking, ocean acidification, deep-ocean hydrothermal flows, eddies, fronts and large-scale turbulence, and diurnal and seasonal changes.

"a story about estimation of a random field of boulders from incomplete seismic measurements","2005","This paper reports on the statistical interpretation of seismic diffraction measurements of boulder locations. The measurements are made in a corridor along the planned tunnel line for the later realized bored tunnel through the till deposits under the East Channel of the Great Belt in Denmark. The investigation was made in 1987–1988 on the initiative of A/S Storebæltsforbindelsen in order to prepare its tendering for the bored tunnel. The purpose was to make a prediction of the density of boulders of maximal dimension above any specified length. The properties of the seismic measuring device and its graphical registrations on seismograms do not make a proper interpretation possible without detailed knowledge about the joint distribution of the primary dimensions of the boulders. Therefore, separate measurements were made of the dimensions of boulders deposited visibly on the cliff beaches of the Great Belt. The surprisingly simple results from the analysis of the data from this separate measuring program are reported in a companion paper. Based on the revealed geographical universality of the joint dimension distribution it is anticipated that the same distribution is applicable for the till deposits along the tunnel line. By use of this important distribution information and of the observed homogeneity of the seismic point source field together with the physical properties of diffraction it became possible to make the wanted prediction. During the excavation, the found boulders were counted and measured. These direct observations on site confirmed that the prediction was quite good.","Probabilistic models,Field investigations,Predictions,Statistical inference,Diffraction,Glacier till,Boulders,Tunnel boring,Seismic surveys,"
"data-driven assessment of the survivability and maintainability of offshore renewable energy devices in irelandâ€™s harsh maritime climate","2023","Unobstructed across the vast expanse of the North Atlantic Ocean, the Irish maritime area encompasses some of the worldâ€™s most energy-intensive waves. However, high winds and associated large waves present a substantial engineering challenge to ensure the survivability of offshore renewable energy devices during extreme weather events. Finding adequate weather windows for installation, operation, and maintenance activities is another obstacle when deploying these devices. This paper presents the results of a large-scale analysis of wave and wind data around the coasts of Ireland and Wales. Extreme Value Analysis calculates the expected wave heights and wind speeds for extreme events (1-year, 10-year, 50-year and 100-year return periods). Weather windows are also calculated based on a matrix of wave heights, wind speeds and minimum durations required.

"gross and microscopic pathology of lesions in pocillopora spp. from the subtropical eastern pacific","2014","Coral reefs are threatened by a variety of factors including diseases that have caused significant damage in some regions such as in the Caribbean. At present, no data are available on coral diseases in the Mexican Pacific where Pocillopora spp. is a dominant component of coral communities. Here, we describe gross and microscopic morphology of lesions found in pocilloporids at four sites in the Mexican Pacific. Corals were identified and their lesions photographed and quantified in the field. Tissue samples were collected from healthy and affected colonies for histopathology. We recorded seven species of pocilloporids at the study sites with Isla Isabel being the location with the highest coral diversity (H′=1.27). Lesions were present in 42% of the colonies and included discoloration (32%), predation-induced tissue loss (30%), unexplained tissue loss (3%) and overgrowth by sponges or algae (35%). The most affected species, P. damicornis (50%), was also one of the most common in the region. No species was more prone to a particular lesion, but there was a significant association between location and the presence of lesions. Northern Islas Marietas (61%) and Isla Isabel (41%) had the highest prevalence of lesions, followed by Manzanillo (37%) and Bahías de Huatulco (23%). Histological changes included atrophy of the surface body wall with depletion of zooxanthellae (91%) in corals with discoloration (bleaching). Ablation of tissue from mesoglea (18%) was also observed. Colonies with unexplained tissue loss showed atrophy and thinning of the epidermis (89%), characterized by cuboidal instead of pseudocolumnar cells normally found in healthy pseudocolumnar ciliated epithelium. Bacterial aggregates between the mesoglea and gastrodermis (11%) were very conspicuous in healthy and diseased corals. Lesions produced by fish bites and gastropods were associated with tissue atrophy (40%) and, in some cases, algal overgrowth near the lesion (20%). No infectious agents associated with cell pathology were detected microscopically. Bleaching and overgrowth by algae and sponges, as well as unexplained tissue loss, are common in Pocillopora. These lesions and anatomical changes warrant further study since their incidence is potentially indicative of reef degradation.","Histopathology,Eastern Pacific,Lesions,Coral diseases,"
"26 - applications of ai and possibilities for process control","2022","Multiphase flows occur in the oil and gas industries, e.g., gas/oil/water/sand (g/o/w/s) in all possible combinations, drilling mud with cuttings and g/o/w/s, in the storage and transport of wet or dry particulates, e.g., fluidized beds, slurries and sedimentation, e.g., as in dredging, in the nuclear power industries, e.g., entrained air, and steam at supercritical temperatures in cooling water in pressurized water reactors. Most of these processes have different flow regimes with varying distributions of the different materials/phases, flowing at different speeds and spread over the cross-section of the conduit supporting the flow, an important topic in CFD studies and software development. These processes are monitored with a plethora of sensors, continuously gathering vast amount of valuable data from various locations with many control loops distributed in the processes with a dedicated overall process control using different strategies, which recently have AI and machine learning techniques in their portfolio. The data from the sensors are valuable in data fusion not only for deterministic mechanistic modeling but also for exploratory data analysis (EDA), a growing branch of AI-based industrial machine learning. Data from process tomography/tomometry using nonintrusive and noninvasive sensing provide big data in real time, useful in identifying various flow phenomena, such as flow regimes, tunneling flow in silos, infiltration of sand in pipes, unusually high presence of gas bubbles in cooling water, etc. In this chapter, some applications of ECT and EIT in the above three process industries are presented. This chapter focuses on the sensor arrays and protocols used along with excitation and sensing methods used in the ECT/EIT modules and then presents some results from EDA as applied in the growing field of industrial machine learning. In all the three branches of process industries mentioned above, interesting results are presented showing possibilities of flow regime identification based on the distribution of the phases involved with the possibilities of integrating ECT/EIT in model free adaptive control of these processes.","Fluidized bed column (FBC),Neural networks,Multiphase flow,Process safety,Sensor data fusion,Process industries,Electrical capacitance/impedance tomography (ECT/EIT),Process tomography,Flow regime,Model free adaptive control (MFAC),Pressurized water reactors,Machine learning,"
"interannual variability of the physical characteristics of north thermaikos gulf (nw aegean sea)","2012","Thermaikos Gulf is a marine ecosystem of major importance, not only environmental, but also due to the various socioeconomic activities associated with the area. The physical characteristics of the gulf's waters were studied, analyzing in situ measurements of oceanographic parameters, collected during 5 oceanographic surveys from 1994 to 2007, on the same grid of 26 sampling stations. Aim of this paper is the detection and description of the main changes (seasonal and interannual) in the water masses' characteristics that are related to the seawater quality of the North Thermaikos. The connection between the main forcing factors and the major circulation patterns is also under investigation. The interannual analysis of the collected data revealed the existence of strong seasonal fluctuations that present significant deviations from a mean seasonal pattern in specific periods. A general decreasing trend of the salinities of the domain is observed during the study period. At the same time, a strong relation between open Aegean Sea waters and riverine freshwater fluxes is identified, factors that significantly influence stratification, circulation and renewal of the gulf. Based on the thermohaline properties, two dense water formation events (February 2000 and 2005), not previously reported, are detected and analyzed for the first time.","Hydrodynamic circulation,Dense water formation,Physical oceanography,Thermaikos Gulf,Stratification,Freshwater fluxes,"
"heterogeneous swarms for maritime dynamic target search and tracking","2020","Current strategies employed for maritime target search and tracking are primarily based on the use of agents following a predetermined path to perform a systematic sweep of a search area. Recently, dynamic Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithms have been used together with swarming multi-robot systems (MRS), giving search and tracking solutions the added properties of robustness, scalability, and flexibility. Swarming MRS also give the end-user the opportunity to incrementally upgrade the robotic system, inevitably leading to the use of heterogeneous swarming MRS. However, such systems have not been well studied and incorporating upgraded agents into a swarm may result in degraded mission performances. In this paper, we propose a PSO-based strategy using a topological k-nearest neighbor graph with tunable exploration and exploitation dynamics with an adaptive repulsion parameter. This strategy is implemented within a simulated swarm of 50 agents with varying proportions of fast agents tracking a target represented by a fictitious binary function. Through these simulations, we are able to demonstrate an increase in the swarm's collective response level and target tracking performance by substituting in a proportion of fast buoys.","fast agents,predetermined path,topological k-nearest neighbor graph,heterogeneous swarms,maritime dynamic target search,tracking solutions,Multi-Robot Search,multi-robot systems,multirobot systems,particle swarm optimisation,target tracking,tunable exploration,upgraded agents,maritime target search,Target tracking,Dynamic Target Search,heterogeneous swarming MRS,Particle swarm optimization,Scalability,Robots,exploitation dynamics,degraded mission performances,systematic sweep,Heterogeneous Swarm,graph theory,Robustness,dynamic particle swarm optimization algorithms,end-user,robotic system,mobile robots,simulated swarm,adaptive repulsion parameter,PSO-based strategy,marine vehicles,Swarm Intelligence,Heuristic algorithms,Systematics,"
"a wavelet-based deep learning pipeline for efficient covid-19 diagnosis via ct slices","2022","The quick diagnosis of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) disease is vital to prevent its propagation and improve therapeutic outcomes. Computed tomography (CT) is believed to be an effective tool for diagnosing COVID-19, however, the CT scan contains hundreds of slices that are complex to be analyzed and could cause delays in diagnosis. Artificial intelligence (AI) especially deep learning (DL), could facilitate and speed up COVID-19 diagnosis from such scans. Several studies employed DL approaches based on 2D CT images from a single view, nevertheless, 3D multiview CT slices demonstrated an excellent ability to enhance the efficiency of COVID-19 diagnosis. The majority of DL-based studies utilized the spatial information of the original CT images to train their models, though, using spectral–temporal information could improve the detection of COVID-19. This article proposes a DL-based pipeline called CoviWavNet for the automatic diagnosis of COVID-19. CoviWavNet uses a 3D multiview dataset called OMNIAHCOV. Initially, it analyzes the CT slices using multilevel discrete wavelet decomposition (DWT) and then uses the heatmaps of the approximation levels to train three ResNet CNN models. These ResNets use the spectral–temporal information of such images to perform classification. Subsequently, it investigates whether the combination of spatial information with spectral–temporal information could improve the diagnostic accuracy of COVID-19. For this purpose, it extracts deep spectral–temporal features from such ResNets using transfer learning and integrates them with deep spatial features extracted from the same ResNets trained with the original CT slices. Then, it utilizes a feature selection step to reduce the dimension of such integrated features and use them as inputs to three support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. To further validate the performance of CoviWavNet, a publicly available benchmark dataset called SARS-COV-2-CT-Scan is employed. The results of CoviWavNet have demonstrated that using the spectral–temporal information of the DWT heatmap images to train the ResNets is superior to utilizing the spatial information of the original CT images. Furthermore, integrating deep spectral–temporal features with deep spatial features has enhanced the classification accuracy of the three SVM classifiers reaching a final accuracy of 99.33% and 99.7% for the OMNIAHCOV and SARS-COV-2-CT-Scan datasets respectively. These accuracies verify the outstanding performance of CoviWavNet compared to other related studies. Thus, CoviWavNet can help radiologists in the rapid and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 diagnosis.","Convolutional neural networks,Discrete wavelet transform (DWT),Deep learning,Computed tomography (CT),COVID-19,ResNet,"
"ensemble estimates reveal a complex hydroclimatic sensitivity of pine growth at carpathian cliff sites","2012","Carpathian pine growth at its natural range limit, where small hydroclimatic fluctuations are indicated by tree-ring width anomalies, may provide insight into past ecological responses to climatic changes. Tree-ring chronologies from extreme cliff sites may also contain annually resolved and accurately dated information to facilitate the development of palaeoclimatic reconstructions. Complex and spatiotemporally inconsistent relationships between biotic and abiotic factors, however, often complicate our understanding of forest growth dynamics. In this study, we utilized a novel ensemble approach of 3240 growth–climate interactions to evaluate the likelihood of temporal fluctuations in the hydroclimatic sensitivity of three newly developed tree-ring width chronologies from 515 Scots pines (Pinus sylvestris). The data represent undisturbed cliff habitats across the northwestern Carpathian arc between 700 and 1050m asl. These sites are located in the northern (N) and southern (S) Tatra Mountains and in-between (M). Two sites (N, S) share common interannual to multi-decadal ring width variability (r=0.73), and they significantly capture variations in 20th-century summer drought conditions (r=0.52–0.65). Temporal instability in the growth–climate response, however, occurred in all three tree-ring chronologies, thus challenging any possible palaeoclimatic value. Orographic-induced climatology was found to dominate the observed growth–climate inconsistency, whereas age-related physiological mechanisms and differences in the absolute growth levels of the trees, as well as methodological standardization constraints and seasonal climate differences appeared to be less important. Our results suggest that environmental and ecological site criteria should be routinely supplemented by statistical data assessments prior to employing tree-ring chronologies for climate reconstructions.","Tatra Mountains,Dendroclimatology,Drought,Tree rings,Dendroecology,Climate variability,"
"spatio-temporal variability of oceanographic conditions in the exclusive economic zone of cuba","2020","In this work we assessed the spatio-temporal variability of the oceanographic conditions in the period 1998–2017 in four sectors of the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of Cuba, referred to as the northwest, northeast, southwest and southeast sectors (i.e., NWS, NES, SWS and SES, respectively). We relied upon remote-sensing observations of wind speed, sea surface temperature (SST), sea surface height anomaly (SSHA) and chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentration along with model predictions of mixed layer depth (MLD), nitrate concentration and net primary production (NPP). We found evidence of the spatially heterogeneous oceanographic conditions of the EEZ of Cuba, since the analysed variables fluctuated spatially with meridional and zonal gradients. Overall, the southern sectors were warmer and less productive than the northern ones, thereby showing the influence of the Caribbean Sea. The NWS showed the highest variability of the physical and biological variables analysed, given the convergence of the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico waters and the Loop Current variability. The NES was strongly influenced by coastal conditions given its limited area and long coast line. Besides, a significant decadal increase in SSHA was linked to that in SST. Still, this warming trend was not reflected in the chl-a concentration and NPP trends, which is consistent with the fact that there has been no change over the studied 20 years in mean wind regime and MLD. Furthermore, the strong El Niño Southern Oscillation events of 1997–1998 and 2015–2016 appear to have considerably impacted the surface chl-a concentration, which was partially governed by the variability of the MLD.","Remote sensing,Exclusive Economic Zone of Cuba,Trends,Oceanographic conditions,"
