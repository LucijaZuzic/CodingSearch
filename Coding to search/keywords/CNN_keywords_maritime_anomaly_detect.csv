"development of a time series imaging approach for fault classification of marine systems","2022","As part of any Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) system for the shipping industry, the determination of the current health of marine systems is fundamental. As such, diagnostic analytics is performed; a process that is typically constituted by fault detection, fault isolation, and fault identification. Although some efforts have been made to distinguish the faults and malfunctions (fault detection) that can occur in marine systems, the implementation of fault identification to provide a description of any considered fault type and its nature is still an unexplored area due to the lack of fault data. To overcome this, a methodology for the identification of anomalies in marine systems is presented in this paper. The proposed approach aims to analyse the implementation of time series imaging through the application of the first-order Markov chain in tandem with an analysis of both ResNet50V2 and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) as part of the image classification task. To highlight the performance of this methodology, anomalies have been simulated considering the power parameter of a diesel generator. Results demonstrated the potential of time series imaging and image classification approaches, as the Markov-CNN achieved an accuracy of 95% when performing the fault classification task.","Anomaly identification,Time series imaging,Marine systems,Fault diagnosis,Prognostics and health management (PHM),Fault classification,Shipping industry,"
"neighborhood rough residual networkâ€“based outlier detection method in iot-enabled maritime transportation systems","2023","Outlier detection can identify anomalies in large-scale data. To provide reliability and security for Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled maritime transportation systems (MTSs), in this paper we propose an outlier detection method based on the neighborhood rough residual network (NRRN). We calculate the neighborhood approximation accuracy and neighborhood conditional entropy to obtain the neighborhood combined entropy describing the discrimination ability of the condition attribute subset to the information system. We then delete the redundant attributes according to the attribute combination importance derived from the neighborhood combined entropy. The data after attribute reduction are used to train the convolutional neural network, and the residual network (ResNet50) is used to avoid the degradation of model performance caused by the increase in the number of network layers. The proposed method is compared with mainstream outlier detection algorithms on a fishing vessel operation dataset. Experiments show that the proposed method can greatly improve the accuracy of outlier detection while taking into account interpretability and computational efficiency, thereby ensuring the data integrity of IoT-enabled MTSs.","Outlier detection,Data models,residual network,neighborhood combined entropy,Transportation,Entropy,data integrity,Anomaly detection,Behavioral sciences,Marine vehicles,Residual neural networks,IoT-enabled maritime transportation systems,"
"a novel approach exploiting properties of convolutional neural networks for vessel movement anomaly detection and classification","2022","The article concerns the automation of vessel movement anomaly detection for maritime and coastal traffic safety services. Deep Learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), were used to solve this problem. Three variants of the datasets, containing samples of vessel traffic routes in relation to the prohibited area in the form of a grayscale image, were generated. 1458 convolutional neural networks with different structures were trained to find the best structure to classify anomalies. The influence of various parameters of network structures on the overall accuracy of classification was examined. For the best networks, class prediction rates were examined. Activations of selected convolutional layers were studied and visualized to present how the network works in a friendly and understandable way. The best convolutional neural network for detecting vessel movement anomalies has been proposed. The proposed CNN is compared with multiple baseline algorithms trained on the same dataset.","Vessel movement anomalies,Convolutional neutral networks,Radar datasets,Deep learning,Anomaly detection,"

"intelligent deep fusion network for anomaly identification in maritime transportation systems","2023","This paper introduces a novel deep learning architecture for identifying outliers in the context of intelligent transportation systems. The use of a convolutional neural network with decomposition is explored to find abnormal behavior in maritime data. The set of maritime data is first decomposed into similar clusters containing homogeneous data, and then a convolutional neural network is used for each data cluster. Different models are trained (one per cluster), and each model is learned from highly correlated data. Finally, the results of the models are merged using a simple but efficient fusion strategy. To verify the performance of the proposed framework, intensive experiments were conducted on marine data. The results show the superiority of the proposed framework compared to the baseline solutions in terms of several accuracy metrics.","maritime data,Transportation,Urban areas,homogeneous data,deep learning (artificial intelligence),highly correlated data,Anomaly detection,maritime transportation systems,transportation,smart and secure transportation systems,intelligent transportation systems,similar clusters,anomaly identification,simple but efficient fusion strategy,Data models,marine data,pattern clustering,convolutional neural network,convolutional neural nets,intelligent deep fusion network,Training,Convolutional neural networks,decomposition,Deep learning,data cluster,learning (artificial intelligence),deep learning architecture,Convolution neural network,"
