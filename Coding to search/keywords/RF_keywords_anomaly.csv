"multi-label classification for ais data anomaly detection using wavelet transform","2022","Thanks to the Automatic Identification System (AIS), ships and other maritime equipment are able to communicate with each other, for example, by sending information about their position. This solution allows for early collision detection when two or more ships are on a collision course. In the newer version of AIS, a satellite infrastructure is used to extend the communication range. Unfortunately, satellite AIS deals with so-called packet collision effect: since there is a problem with synchronizing AIS data coming from multiple terrestrial areas, a single satellite may receive several AIS messages at the same time and be unable to correctly process them, causing the data to get lost or garbled. In this article, a machine learning based framework for detecting the incorrect AIS data is presented. In this approach, after the first stage (clustering), a dedicated anomaly detection algorithm searches for damaged AIS messages and conducts multi-label classification (with Random Forest and wavelet transform) to decide which fields of such message requires further correction. The results of measuring the effectiveness of the proposed approach using real AIS data are presented.","telecommunication security,Clustering algorithms,incorrect AIS data,single satellite,Anomaly detection,Wavelet transforms,anomaly detection,random forests,collision course,Marine vehicles,Machine learning,damaged AIS messages,Data analysis,dedicated anomaly detection algorithm searches,satellite communication,ships,wavelet transform,pattern classification,random forest,Classification algorithms,multiple terrestrial areas,pattern clustering,machine learning based framework,Artificial intelligence,multi-label classification,multilabel classification,wavelet transforms,satellite infrastructure,AIS data anomaly detection,maritime equipment,communication range,Trajectory,marine communication,Labeling,early collision detection,AIS data analysis,packet collision effect,satellite AIS deals,"
"on the effectiveness of ai-assisted anomaly detection methods in maritime navigation","2020","The automatic identification system (AIS) has become an essential tool for maritime security. Nevertheless, how to effectively use the static and dynamic voyage information of the AIS data in maritime traffic situation awareness is still a challenge. This paper presents a comparative study of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques on their effectiveness in dealing with various anomalies in maritime domain using the AIS data. The AIS on-off switching (OOS) anomaly is critical in maritime security, since AIS technology is susceptible to manipulation and it can be switched on and off to hide illegal activities. Thus, we try to detect and distinguish between intentional and non-intentional AIS OOS anomalies through our AI -assisted anomaly detection framework. We use AIS data, in particular positional and navigational status of vessels, to study the effectiveness of seven AI techniques, such as artificial neural network, support vector machine, logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, decision tree, random forest and naive Bayes, in detecting the AIS OOS anomalies. Our experimental results show that ANN and SVM are the most suitable techniques in detecting the AIS OOS anomalies with 99.9% accuracy. Interestingly, the ANN model outperforms others when trained with a balanced (i.e., same order of samples per class) dataset, and SVM, on the other hand, is suitable when training dataset is unbalanced.","maritime traffic situation awareness,AI-assisted anomaly detection,decision trees,Support vector machines,logistic regression,Anomaly detection,static voyage information,random forests,ANN,marine navigation,Feature extraction,security of data,maritime security,k-nearest neighbors,regression analysis,AIS technology,naive Bayes,neural nets,naive Bayes methods,automatic identification system,marine safety,marine engineering,support vector machines,maritime navigation,dynamic voyage information,maritime domain,random forest,SVM,Artificial intelligence,AIS on-off switching anomaly,nearest neighbour methods,artificial neural network,Training,Trajectory,support vector machine,nonintentional AIS OOS anomalies,Navigation,artificial intelligence,decision tree,AIS data,"
"neural network-based automatic reconstruction of missing vessel trajectory data","2019","Automatic identification system (AIS) is an independent tracking system which has been widely utilized on ships to frequently broadcast the time-stamped vessel position reports. The generated massive AIS data can contribute to protecting maritime security and enhancing maritime transportation efficiency, such as maritime surveillance, anomaly detection and traffic route extraction, etc. However, the received AIS-based vessel trajectories commonly suffer from missing data due to network overload and bad weathers. To improve the quality of vessel trajectories for further researches, a two-step calculation method for vessel trajectory reconstruction is proposed in this work. In particular, the Random Forest method is introduced in the first step to automatically identify the missing position records within vessel trajectories. The missing data points could be accurately estimated from both theoretical and practical perspectives. The second step proposes a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based supervised learning method to reconstruct the vessel trajectories with missing AIS data. The LSTM-based reconstruction method is able to take full advantage of the similar geometrical features behind massive vessel trajectories. Experimental results have confirmed the superior performance of the proposed two-step method in terms of both effectiveness and robustness.","two-step calculation method,surveillance,missing position records,massive AIS data,LSTM-based reconstruction method,random forests,anomaly detection,transportation,Marine vehicles,trajectory reconstruction,maritime security,Random Forest method,long short-term memory-based supervised learning method,network overload,Radio frequency,Decision trees,neural nets,neural network-based automatic reconstruction,vessel trajectory data,ships,automatic identification system,marine safety,marine engineering,maritime surveillance,AIS-based vessel trajectories,trajectory data mining,time-stamped vessel position reports,Logic gates,massive vessel trajectories,Automatic identification system,missing AIS data,Trajectory,traffic route extraction,missing data points,vessel trajectory reconstruction,two-step method,independent tracking system,long short-term memory,maritime transportation efficiency,learning (artificial intelligence),tracking,bad weathers,"
"random finite set tracking for anomaly detection in the presence of clutter","2020","In this paper, a sequential Bayesian framework is proposed to address the task of joint anomaly detection and tracking for surveillance applications in the presence of clutter. This is achieved by modeling the anomaly as a switching unknown control input which goes into action by modifying the expected dynamics of a target and ceases its activity (becomes nonexistent) under nominal behavior. Random Finite Sets (RFS) make it possible to represent the switching nature of the object anomalous behavior and derive a hybrid Bernoulli filter (HBF) that sequentially updates the joint posterior density of a Bernoulli RFS for the unknown velocity input and the object kinematic state. In addition, the proposed HBF has been customized for maritime anomaly detection by using a piecewise Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) stochastic process as dynamic model of vessels. We illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed filter, implemented in Gaussian-mixture form, and compare its performance in a maritime surveillance example with the Interacting Multiple Model Probabilistic Data Association Filter (IMM - PDAF) for different levels of clutter.","surveillance,sensor fusion,Anomaly detection,Bayes methods,Mathematical model,Switches,switching nature,switching unknown control input,Interacting Multiple Model Probabilistic Data Association Filter,Radio frequency,target tracking,unknown velocity input,sequential Bayesian framework,object tracking,Random Finite Sets,nominal behavior,surveillance applications,filtering theory,hybrid Bernoulli filter,Gaussian processes,Bernoulli RFS,Radar tracking,maritime anomaly detection,random Finite set tracking,clutter,joint anomaly detection,HBF,probability,Clutter,joint posterior density,object anomalous behavior,object kinematic state,Gaussian-mixture form,piecewise Ornstein-Uhlenbeck stochastic process,maritime surveillance example,"
"bayesian filtering for dynamic anomaly detection and tracking","2022","This article presents a Bayesian approach for sequential detection of anomalies in the motion of a target and joint tracking. The anomaly is modeled as a binary (on/off) switching unknown control input that goes into action (begins to exist, or â€œswitches onâ€) thereby modifying the object dynamics; and by ceasing its activity (becoming nonexistent, or â€œswitching offâ€) returns the dynamics to nominal. The developed Bayesian framework brings together random finite set (RFS) theory to represent the switching nature of the anomaly, and optimal joint input and state estimation to sequentially update a hybrid state that incorporates a random vector for the kinematic state and a Bernoulli RFS for the unknown control input. In addition, a closed-form solution, the Gaussian-mixture hybrid Bernoulli filter (GM-HBF), has been developed to provide a customized solution for dynamic anomaly detection in the maritime domain characterized by linear Gaussian target dynamics. Based on the Ornsteinâ€“Uhlenbeck dynamic model for vessels, where the evolution of the object velocity is governed by a piecewise mean-reverting stochastic process, the anomaly can be represented by a change in the long-run mean velocity (i.e., the unknown control input) from the nominal condition that forces the vessel to deviate from its standard route. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed GM-HBF in both simulated and real-world maritime surveillance applications and test its performance in the face of false measurements, detection uncertainty, and sensor data gaps.","developed Bayesian framework,surveillance,kinematic state,Mathematical models,Anomaly detection,Automatic identification system (AIS),Bayesian approach,random finite sets (RFSs),Bayesian filtering,Bayes methods,object dynamics,linear Gaussian target dynamics,Switches,Bernoulli filter,switching unknown control input,Radio frequency,target tracking,Aerodynamics,stochastic processes,filtering theory,radar,state estimation,detection uncertainty,Gaussian processes,Bernoulli RFS,Radar tracking,maritime anomaly detection,dynamic anomaly detection,joint input and state estimation (JISE),probability,Ornstein-Uhlenbeck dynamic model,GM-HBF,Gaussian-mixture hybrid Bernoulli filter,"
"hybrid bernoulli filtering for detection and tracking of anomalous path deviations","2018","This paper presents a solution to the problem of sequential joint anomaly detection and tracking of a target subject to switching unknown path deviations. Based on a dynamic model described by Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) stochastic processes, the anomaly is represented by a target (e.g., a marine vessel) that deviates from a preset route by changing its nominal mean velocity. The Random Finite Set (RFS) framework is used to represent the switching nature of target's anomalous behavior in the presence of spurious measurements and detection uncertainty. Combining these two ingredients, the problem of jointly detecting target's path deviations and estimating its kinematic state can be formulated within the Bayesian framework, and analytically solved by means of a hybrid Bernoulli filter that sequentially updates the joint posterior density of the unknown OU velocity input (a Bernoulli RFS) and of the target's state random vector. We illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed filter, implemented in Gaussian-mixture form, in a simulated scenario of vessel tracking for maritime traffic monitoring.","Anomaly detection,switching nature,state random vector,Sea measurements,Stochastic processes,Radio frequency,vessel tracking,hybrid Bernoulli filtering,target tracking,Random Finite Set framework,stochastic processes,filtering theory,hybrid Bernoulli filter,Target tracking,object detection,Gaussian processes,Bayesian framework,Artificial intelligence,anomalous path deviations,unknown OU velocity input,nominal mean velocity,Surveillance,marine vessel,joint posterior density,sequential joint anomaly detection,"
