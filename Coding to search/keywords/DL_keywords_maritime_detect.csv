"a novel quality control method of time-series ocean wave observation data combining deep-learning prediction and statistical analysis","2023","Quality control (QC) of marine data is a critical aspect in ensuring the usability of oceanic data. In this paper, we propose a novel QC method for time-series ocean wave data, which combines deep learning prediction and statistical analysis. Our method first realizes multi-element LSTM prediction of the time-series ocean wave observation data, capturing both temporal consistency and physical relationships between the multi-element inputs. Then, it applies peak detection on the regional mean difference ratio derived from the predicted and true values of the ocean wave data, and finally labels the anomalous data points based on peak detection results. We conducted experiments on the time-series wave data of four sites from the National Marine Science Center, China, and compared our proposed method with traditional QC method that is currently used for operational marine data quality control, as well as classic anomaly detection models including Isolation Forest and VAE-LSTM. The results show a significant improvement in the Precision, Recall, and F1 Score for erroneous samples using our proposed method. Our proposed method takes advantages of both deep learning and statistical analysis and considers physical correlation of multiple elements of marine data, effectively addressing the problem of erroneous discrimination of abnormal sea conditions in the traditional method, and providing valuable insights for the study of marine time-series observational data.","Deep-learning prediction,Time-series data,Statistical analysis,Quality control,"
"seadronessee: a maritime benchmark for detecting humans in open water","2022","Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are of crucial importance in search and rescue missions in maritime environments due to their flexible and fast operation capabilities. Modern computer vision algorithms are of great interest in aiding such missions. However, they are dependent on large amounts of real-case training data from UAVs, which is only available for traffic scenarios on land. Moreover, current object detection and tracking data sets only provide limited environmental information or none at all, neglecting a valuable source of information. Therefore, this paper introduces a large-scaled visual object detection and tracking benchmark (SeaDronesSee) aiming to bridge the gap from land-based vision systems to sea-based ones. We collect and annotate over 54,000 frames with 400,000 instances captured from various altitudes and viewing angles ranging from 5 to 260 meters and 0 to 90Â° degrees while providing the respective meta information for altitude, viewing angle and other meta data. We evaluate multiple state-of-the-art computer vision algorithms on this newly established benchmark serving as baselines. We provide an evaluation server where researchers can upload their prediction and compare their results on a central leaderboard1.","unmanned aerial vehicles,search and rescue missions,Benchmark testing,emergency management,environmental information,multiple state-of-the-art computer vision algorithms,Machine vision,SeaDronesSee,meta information,meta data,open water,Object Detection/Recognition/Categorization,Training data,computer vision,object detection,maritime environments,Security/Surveillance,traffic scenarios,Remote Sensing,visual object detection,autonomous aerial vehicles,tracking data,Visualization,Object detection,flexible operation capabilities,marine control,Evaluation and Comparison of Vision Algorithms Deep Learning,Meters,Computer vision,Datasets,land-based vision systems,UAVs,"

"maritime situational awareness forensics tools for a common information sharing environment (cise)","2019","CISE stands for Common Information Sharing Environment and refers to an architecture and set of protocols, procedures and services for the exchange of data and information across Maritime Authorities of EU (European Union) Member States (MS's). In the context of enabling the implementation and adoption of CISE by different MS's, EU has funded a number of projects that enable the development of subsystems and adaptors intended to allow MS's to connect and make use of CISE. In this context, the Integrated Systems Laboratory (ISL) has led the development of the corresponding Hellenic and Cypriot CISE by developing a Control, Command & Information (C2I) system that unifies all partial maritime surveillance systems into one National Situational Picture Management (NSPM) system, and adaptors that allow the interconnection of the corresponding national legacy systems to CISE and the exchange of data, information and requests between the two MS's. Furthermore, a set of forensics tools that allow geospatial & time filtering and detection of anomalies, risk incidents, fake MMSIs, suspicious speed changes, collision paths, and gaps in AIS (Automatic Identification System), have been developed by combining motion models, AI, deep learning and fusion algorithms using data from different databases through CISE. This paper briefly discusses these developments within the EU CISE-2020, Hellenic CISE and CY-CISE projects and the benefits from the sharing of maritime data across CISE for both maritime surveillance and security.

"pixel-wise ship identification from maritime images via a semantic segmentation model","2022","Accurately identifying ships from maritime surveillance videos attracts increasing attention in the smart ship community, considering that the videos provide informative yet easily understandable spatialâ€“temporal traffic information for varied maritime traffic participants. Previous studies (e.g., ship detection and ship tracking) are conducted by learning distinct features from training samples labeled in terms of bounding boxes, and thus, background pixels may be wrongly trained as ship features. To bridge the gap, we propose a novel approach for achieving a pixel-wise ship segmentation and identification task through a novel design of U-Net deep learning architecture (denoted as EU-Net). The encoder of the EU-Net extracts distinct ship features from input maritime images, and its decoder outputs ship segmentation results in the pixel-wise manner. The proposed EU-Net model consists of encoder and decoder parts via the help of a convolution layer, a depth separable convolution layer, a softmax layer, and so on. More specifically, the EU-Net model identifies each pixel into ship or non-ship as the final output. Experimental results suggest that our proposed model can accurately identify ship (in terms of pixels), considering that the ship segmentation accuracies were larger than 99%.

We analyze the utilization of deep learning techniques and therefore evaluate two state-of-the-art object detection approaches for their applicability in the maritime domain: Faster R-CNN and Mask R-CNN. To train the Mask R-CNN including the instance segmentation branch, a novel algorithm for automated generation of instance segmentation labels is introduced. The obtained results show that the SMD is sufficient to be used for domain adaptation. The highest f-score is achieved with a fine-tuned Mask R-CNN.

"maritime visible image classification based on double transfer method","2020","Image classification using deep transfer learning has received significant attention, benefiting from pre-trained with the large-scale annotation dataset and continuous improvement of neural network structure. In contrast to universal image classification, however, few publicly available datasets of maritime environments utilize deep transfer learning. Due to data-gathering effort and computational cost, the maritime datasets are deficient in the method of merging datasets and the benchmark of few-shot dataset classifiers. In this article, we proposed the double transfer method, consisting of the merging datasets network and the backbone network, to address the problem. The merging datasets network measuring image similarity separates classes of known and unknown samples to reorganize a dataset, and the backbone network is constructed from the model EfficientNet-b5 by network-based deep transfer learning. Using the merging datasets network, we introduce the visible maritime image dataset, which has 3,750 images and twenty-five classes, including multitudinous maritime objects. The backbone networks evaluated and analyzed the dataset based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F-measure metrics.

"maritime uav patrol tasks based on yolov4 object detection","2022","The search and rescue operations conducted by designated maritime patrol troops usually employ ships and helicopters in their search and rescue work at sea, making it a resource-intensive undertaking both in terms of patrolling equipment and trained personnel. Oftentimes, when the victims send an SOS or call for help, the rescue unit in question can easily obtain the ship's information but cannot access prevailing maritime images of the sea, thus hindering them from swiftly controlling the accident site as effectively. This work endeavors to address this deficiency and proposes an automated patrolling operation based on small UAVs and a diverse set of maritime search patterns corresponding to different sea areas. Maritime images are collected via a deep neural network-based UAV and promptly returned to the search and rescue system. The object detection model in this case is trained using extensive images of maritime accidents collected from the network. This object detection model based on the YOLOv4 framework is thus used in the timely detection of maritime accidents. Post detection, an alarm system is set up to classify the danger level of the targets and to trigger rescue operations corresponding to the level of danger, followed by an alarm message sent to the rescuers by Short Message Service (SMS).

"framework for ship trajectory forecasting based on linear stationary models using automatic identification system","2022","Maritime surveillance is of utmost priority for a nation's security, and hence it's economy. For maritime awareness, coastal surveillance, and maritime activities in the Region of Interest (ROI) should be monitored. One of the ways to keep this in check is to restrain unwanted infiltration. Monitoring unwanted infiltration is feasible through vessel trajectory forecasting and anomaly detection in real time. Most solutions for trajectory predictions are available but require a huge amount of historical data, and high-power computing resources. Here, the requirement is developing a decision support framework consisting of both lite weight approaches for short-term predictions and deep learning-based techniques for long-term forecasting. This paper aims to find the suitability of Linear Stationary Models (LSM) like the Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average Model (ARIMA) for predicting and forecasting the Vessel Trajectory as means of lite weight short-term predictions. For this purpose, the Automatic Identification System (AIS) dataset of the U.S. West Coast is used. The significant effort was for data pre-processing to create a robust dataset for model training. An appropriate model after the model-selection process is used for trajectory forecasting. The model's accuracy is validated using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) performance indices for residual and forecast errors. A window generator model is integrated with the best-fitted ARIMA model for recursive real-time predictions, with varied sizes and visualization. The proposed time-series model provided a very high accuracy as the RMSE value for prediction and 48 hours forecast are 0.023 and 0.017, respectively.","Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average Model,Window Generator,Trajectory Forecast,Time Series Analysis,Automatic Identification System,Maritime Surveillance,"

"intrusion detection for maritime transportation systems with batch federated aggregation","2023","As a fast-growing and promising technology, Internet of Things (IoT) significantly promotes the informationization and intelligentization of Maritime Transportation System (MTS). The massive data collected during the voyage is usually disposed of with the assistance of cloud or edge computing, which imposes serious cyber security threats.

However, most of the methods based on deep learning train their models in a centralized manner, which needs uploading all data to the central server for training, increasing the risk of privacy disclosure. In this paper, we consider the characteristics of IoT-based MTS and propose a CNN-MLP based model for intrusion detection which is trained through Federated Learning, named FedBatch. Federated Learning keeps the model training local and only updates the global model through the exchange of model parameters, preserving the privacy of local data on vessels. First, the characteristics of the communication between different vessels are discussed to model the federated learning process during the voyage.

"enabling maritime risk assessment using natural language processing-based deep learning techniques","2020","Maritime vessels around the world risk encountering dangerous situations during their voyages such as piracy, kidnappings, hijackings, and smugglings. Such dangers may put crews at risk and potentially cause extensive damage to both the vessel and its cargo. Maritime risk assessment is a process of analyzing such factors to positively impact the safety and timeliness of operations. Analyzing the high-risk areas in seas and oceans can help vessels route around areas with previously recorded high levels of dangerous activities. This information is scraped and extracted from various maritime documents, including newspaper articles, social media, incident blogs, and operational reports. After textual data sources are parsed, it is possible to use this extracted information as training datasets into a Machine Learning (ML) model using Natural Language Processing (NLP) Deep Learning (DL) techniques. With these methods, we can perform document classification, risk extraction, text summarization, topic modeling, and information extraction in an automated manner.

Once this information is processed, the model can determine and aggregate specific areas of high-risk activity. We propose a Maritime Event Log (MEL) pipeline using DL methods. This pipeline includes binary document classification (DC) to extract positive instances of incidents, an incident type classification (IC,) and an information extraction module (IE) including date and location and ship type extraction.

Such models have been extensively applied to perform anomaly detection tasks, with the express purpose of detecting data patterns that deviate significantly from normal operational behaviour. Due to its preeminent importance in the maritime industry to adequately identify the behaviour of marine systems, the Real-time Anomaly Detection Intelligent System (RADIS) framework, constituted by a Long Short-Term Memory-based Variational Autoencoder in tandem with multi-level Otsu’s thresholding, is proposed. RADIS aims to address the current gaps identified within the maritime industry in relation to data-driven model applications for enabling smart maintenance. To assess the performance of such a framework, a case study on a total of 14 parameters obtained from sensors installed on a diesel generator of a tanker ship is introduced to highlight the implementation of RADIS. Results demonstrated the capability of RADIS to be part of a diagnostic analytics tool that will promote the implementation of smart maintenance within the maritime industry, as RADIS detected an average of 92.5% of anomalous instances in the presented case study.","Marine machinery,Deep learning,Intelligent real-time systems,Anomaly detection,Smart maintenance,Ship systems,"

"an adaptive ionosphere clutter suppression and target detection method for hfswr maritime surveillance","2023","High-frequency surface wave radar (HFSWR) as a maritime surveillance facility faces the tough challenges. One of them is that various unwanted echo components constantly destroy the detection performance of HFSWR, especially the dynamically changing ionosphere clutter. This article proposes an adaptive ionosphere clutter suppression and target detection algorithm (AICSTD) based on improved higher order singular value decomposition (HOSVD) and deep learning network. First, we analyze the multiple-dimensional characteristics of different types of ionosphere clutter echo data. Then, refer to the multichannel HFSWR echo data structure, we apply simplified HOSVD and orthogonal subspace projection to eliminate the unwanted echo component and, meanwhile, preserve the target echo. The key parameter of simplified HOSVD is determined by the mean structural similarity (MSSIM) index, which contributes to reduce the computation complexity of the proposed method. Finally, we improved the deep learning network to detect the targets in various behaviors after the clutter suppression. In order to address the issue of limited clutter data, transfer learning based on historical radar echo data is applied. A thorough experimental analysis on various real clutter data shows that the proposed method performs competitively. Our method shows a superior performance over many state-of-the-art clutter suppression methods, with a covered target detection accuracy of 92.4% under strong spread clutter background.","Ionosphere,structural similarity (SSIM) index,higher order singular value decomposition (HOSVD),ionosphere clutter suppression,Tensors,Clutter,Deep learning,Object detection,Doppler effect,target detection,high-frequency surface wave radar (HFSWR),Reflection,"

"deep learning-powered vessel trajectory prediction for improving smart traffic services in maritime internet of things","2022","The maritime Internet of Things (IoT) has recently emerged as a revolutionary communication paradigm where a large number of moving vessels are closely interconnected in intelligent maritime networks. However, the tremendous growth of vessel trajectories, collected from the combined satellite-terrestrial AIS (automatic identification system) base stations, could lead to unsatisfactory maritime safety and efficacy. To promote smart traffic services in maritime IoT, it is necessary to accurately and robustly predict the spatiotemporal vessel trajectories. It is beneficial for collision avoidance, maritime surveillance, and abnormal behavior detection, etc. Motivated by the strong learning capacity of deep neural networks, this work proposes an AIS data-driven trajectory prediction framework, whose main component is a long short term memory (LSTM) network. In particular, the vessel traffic conflict situation modeling, generated using the dynamic AIS data and social force concept, is embedded into the LSTM network to guarantee high-accuracy vessel trajectory prediction.

"maritime environment perception based on deep learning","2022","Environment perception is an essential aspect of automated maritime vehicles, especially in high-traffic areas. In recent years, deep-learning-based object detection using LiDAR has been well developed in the automotive sector but has not yet seen a similar level of sophisticated development in maritime applications. In these applications, LiDAR detection should be fused with other maritime navigation systems such as the automatic identification system (AIS) to expand the detection range. To address this, we propose a novel deep-learning-based concept for maritime environment perception by using LiDAR as a primary sensor and AIS as an assisting information source. This approach consists of three functional modules: object detection, multi-object tracking, and static environment mapping. For object detection, we apply a convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect floating objects represented as oriented bounding boxes. To train the CNN, we propose a method that generates simulated labeled datasets. The detected objects from CNN are tracked with Kalman Filter banks. The remaining LiDAR data points are treated as static environments and represented by polygons. We evaluated the approach by using simulative and real-world datasets. In the simulation, the average precision of the CNN object detector reaches 60.8%, with a data processing rate of 40 Hz in GPU. Our real-world evaluations show that this approach can track 83% of the vessels in a crowded harbor, with the overall intersection over union reaching 64%.

"adaptive detection tracking system for autonomous uav maritime patrolling","2020","Nowadays, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are considered reliable systems, suitable for several autonomous applications, especially for target detection and tracking. Although significant developments were achieved in object detection systems over the last decades using the deep learning technique known as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), there are still research gaps in this area. In this paper, we present a new object detection-tracking algorithm that can be used on low power consuming processing boards. In particular, we analysed a specific application scenario in which a UAV patrols coastlines and autonomously classifies different kind of marine objects. Current state of the art solutions propose centralised architectures or flying systems with human in the loop, making the whole system poorly efficient and not scalable. On the contrary, applying a Deep Learning detection system that runs on commercial Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) makes UAVs potentially more efficient than humans (especially for dull tasks like coastline patrolling) and the whole system becomes easily scalable because each UAV can fly independently and the Ground Control Station does not represent a bottleneck. To deal with this task, a database consisting of more than 115000 images was created to train and test several CNN architectures. Furthermore, an adaptive detection-tracking algorithm was introduced to make the whole system faster by optimizing the balancing between detecting new objects and tracking existing targets.

"deep learning to enhance maritime situation awareness","2019","Maritime surveillance sensors like AIS (Automatic Identification System) and Radar provide useful information for decision-making support, which is of paramount importance for effective operations against maritime threats and illegal activities [1]. However, decision-making systems that trust solely on AIS information tend to fail in real situations because such information could be missing, inaccurate or even deceptive [2]. On the other hand, only Radar information is not enough to get a complete description of the maritime situational picture. This paper proposes a deep learning framework for vessel monitoring that examines a particular scenario where a deep learning solution can infer a navigation status based on the vessels trajectories, and thus to detect suspicious vessels activities. For this purpose, a dataset, named DeepMarine, has been specifically created by collecting data of AIS historical recordings.

"predictive maintenance leveraging machine learning for time-series forecasting in the maritime industry","2020","One of the key challenges in the maritime industry refers to minimizing the time a vessel cannot be utilized, which has multiple effects. The latter is addressed through maintenance approaches that however in many cases are not efficient in terms of cost and downtime. Predictive maintenance provides optimized maintenance scheduling offering extended vessel lifespan, coupled with reduced maintenance costs. As in several industries, including the maritime domain, an increasing amount of data is made available through the deployment and exploitation of data sources, such as on board sensors that provide real-time information. These data provide the required ground for analysis and thus support for various types of data-driven decision making. In the maritime domain, sensors are deployed on vessels to monitor their engines and data analysis tools are needed to assist engineers towards reduced operational risk through predictive maintenance solutions that are put in place. In this paper, we present an approach for anomaly detection on time-series data, utilizing machine learning on the vessels sensor data, in order to predict the condition of specific parts of the vessel's main engine and thus facilitate predictive maintenance.

"eprd: exploiting prior knowledge for evidence-providing automatic rumor detection","2023","With the prevalence of social media platforms, rumors have been a serious social problem. Notably, existing rumor detection methods simply provide detection labels while ignoring their explanation. However, illustrating the reasons why a suspicious statement is a rumor is essential. To address this realistic scenario, we propose a novel Evidence-Providing Rumor Detection model called EPRD. EPRD incorporates a wide variety of information from both prior knowledge sources and current comments. It also learns bilaterally friendly representations for interpretable rumor detection. EPRD first retrieves evidence from prior knowledge sources and checks the relationship between the given statement and its evidence. Our model then constructs two heterogeneous graph objects to simulate the propagation layout of the current comments and evidence relationships. Finally, EPRD integrates the GraphSAGE component and attention mechanism to detect rumors. To the best of our knowledge, we propose the first model that incorporates prior knowledge to verify rumors and boost credibility. Experiments on two real-world Twitter datasets demonstrate that EPRD consistently exhibits the best rumor detection performance. Moreover, EPRD outperforms other baselines in the early rumor detection task.","Deep learning,Graph neural network,Rumor detection,Evidence,Natural language inference,"
"maritime target detection based on radar graph data and graph convolutional network","2022","Due to the complex sea clutter environment and target features, the conventional statistical theory-based methods cannot achieve high performance in maritime target detection tasks. Conventional deep learning, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs)-based target detection methods process each signal sample independently, and the temporal-spatial domain correlation information is seldom used. To achieve full utilization of information contained in radar signals and improve the detection performance, a graph convolutional network (GCN) is considered, which has shown great advantages in graph data processing and has been applied in the field of signal processing. This letter proposed a maritime target detection method based on radar signal graph data and graph convolution. Graph structure data is applied to define the detection units and to represent the temporal and spatial information of detection units. The target detection of the signal corresponding to the nodes is conducted via GCN. Experimental results show that the proposed approach can effectively detect marine targets when the signal-to-noise ratio is above âˆ’5 dB and can effectively suppress false alarms in the pure clutter area, which is not adjacent to targets.

"hfpnet: super feature aggregation pyramid network for maritime remote sensing small-object detection","2023","In recent years, with the development of the maritime industry, computer vision tasks based on optical remote sensing images have gained increasing attention in the field of marine remote sensing. However, in complex marine meteorological environments, traditional detection methods often suffer from high rates of missed detections and false alarms for small targets. To address this issue, this article proposes a super feature pyramid network (HFPNet) for detecting marine remote sensing objects, which includes a feature enhancement module (FEM) and a multiscale feature aggregation module (MFM). The FEM can highlight features of small targets and weaken complex background features in detection, the MFM can share high-level and low-level features to better fuse multiscale feature information. Additionally, due to the lack of marine remote sensing object datasets, this article constructs a marine target detection dataset (MTDS) containing six types of marine objects. To address the issue of imbalanced positive and negative samples in the dataset, this article designs a network loss function to accelerate network convergence and improve the accuracy of small-target detection. Compared with other models, HFPNet achieved the highest $\text{mAP}_{0.5}$ of 97.48% and 95.46% on the self-built dataset MTDS and the public dataset NWPU-VHR-10, respectively, after environmental enhancement.

"maritime radar target detection in sea clutter based on cnn with dual-perspective attention","2023","Radar-based maritime target detection plays an important role in ocean monitoring. Considering the practical application, pulse-compression radar is widely used in terms of civilian offshore surface target detection. The existence of sea clutter will greatly interfere the detection performance of pulse-compression radar. This leads to the low detection performance of traditional algorithms like constant false alarm rate (CFAR). Deep learning methods have made strides in many fields recently, such as natural language processing and speech recognition. Inspired by this idea, we propose a maritime radar target detection method in sea clutter based on convolution neural network (CNN) and dual-perspective attention (DPA). The proposed method first encodes the radar echo in high-dimensional space and then extracts the correlation features from the global and local perspectives through the attention mechanism. We deployed the X-band pulse-compression radar on the coast of Hainan, China, and collected a lot of measured data. Experimental results demonstrate that the detection performance of our method outperforms the traditional CFAR methods and the latest deep learning-based methods.

"an automated sar-based method for ship detection in maritime surveillance system","2023","Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is an active Earth observation system that can obtain high-resolution ocean images all day and all weather. It can be used for monitoring the marine environment, maritime traffic, and oil spills at sea. SAR provides accurate and real-time ocean information, which can ensure water traffic safety and ecological environment. Therefore, it plays an irreplaceable role in maritime surveillance. At present, deep-learning based object detection methods have achieved certain results in the application of ship detection in SAR images. Ship targets in SAR images have strong angular reflection characteristics, causing some parts of them to have large grayscale values, appearing as scattering points. At the same time, the heading of ship usually has a certain angle with the horizontal direction. Traditional deep-learning models do not have sufficient generalization ability for these situations. Horizontal bounding boxes also contain a large amount of background features, which affects the accuracy of the model. In response to these characteristics, first use convolutional neural network to extract ship features; Secondly, generate oriented proposals to reduce the impact of background features; Thirdly, using Canny and Harris to obtain features of ship edges and scattering points as attention mechanisms to enhance bounding box regression and classification; Finally, optimize the loss function, which will consider the influence of angle.

"asynchronous trajectory matching-based multimodal maritime data fusion for vessel traffic surveillance in inland waterways","2023","The automatic identification system (AIS) and video cameras have been widely exploited for vessel traffic surveillance in inland waterways. The AIS data could provide vessel identity and dynamic information on vessel position and movements. In contrast, the video data could describe the visual appearances of moving vessels without knowing the information on identity, position, movements, etc. To further improve vessel traffic surveillance, it becomes necessary to fuse the AIS and video data to simultaneously capture the visual features, identity, and dynamic information for the vessels of interest. However, the performance of AIS and video data fusion is susceptible to issues such as data spatial difference, message asynchronous transmission, visual object occlusion, etc. In this work, we propose a deep learning-based simple online and real-time vessel data fusion method (termed DeepSORVF). We first extract the AIS-and video-based vessel trajectories, and then propose an asynchronous trajectory matching method to fuse the AIS-based vessel information with the corresponding visual targets. In addition, by combining the AIS-and video-based movement features, we also present a prior knowledge-driven anti-occlusion method to yield accurate and robust vessel tracking results under occlusion conditions. To validate the efficacy of our DeepSORVF, we have also constructed a new benchmark dataset (termed FVessel) for vessel detection, tracking, and data fusion. It consists of many videos and the corresponding AIS data collected in various weather conditions and locations. The experimental results have demonstrated that our method is capable of guaranteeing high-reliable data fusion and anti-occlusion vessel tracking.

"ais data-driven ship trajectory prediction modelling and analysis based on machine learning and deep learning methods","2023","Maritime transport faces new safety challenges in an increasingly complex traffic environment caused by large-scale and high-speed ships, particularly with the introduction of intelligent and autonomous ships. It is evident that Automatic Identification System (AIS) data-driven ship trajectory prediction can effectively aid in identifying abnormal ship behaviours and reducing maritime risks such as collision, stranding, and contact. Furthermore, trajectory prediction is widely recognised as one of the critical technologies for realising safe autonomous navigation. The prediction methods and their performance are the key factors for future safe and automatic shipping. Currently, ship trajectory prediction lacks the real performance measurement and analysis of different algorithms, including classical machine learning and emerging deep learning methods. This paper aims to systematically analyse the performance of ship trajectory prediction methods and pioneer experimental tests to reveal their advantages and disadvantages as well as fitness in different scenarios involving complicated systems. To do so, five machine learning methods (i.e., Kalman Filter (KF), Support Vector Progression (SVR), Back Propagation network (BP), Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), and Random Forest (RF)) and seven deep learning methods (i.e., Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gate Recurrent Unit (GRU), Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM), Sequence to Sequence (Seq2seq), Bi-directional Gate Recurrent Unit (Bi-GRU), and Transformer) are first extracted from the state-of-the-art literature review and then employed to implement the trajectory prediction and compare their prediction performance in the real world. Three AIS datasets are collected from the waters of representative traffic features, including a normal channel (i.e., the Chengshan Jiao Promontory), complex traffic (i.e., the Zhoushan Archipelago), and a port area (i.e., Caofeidian port). They are selected to test and analyse the performance of all twelve methods based on six evaluation indexes and explore the characteristics and effectiveness of the twelve trajectory prediction methods in detail. The experimental results provide a novel perspective, comparison, and benchmark for ship trajectory prediction research, which not only demonstrates the fitness of each method in different maritime traffic scenarios, but also makes significant contributions to maritime safety and autonomous shipping development.","Deep learning,Maritime safety,Trajectory prediction,AIS data,Machine learning,"

In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning based maritime anti-jamming communication scheme that applies the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) as the relay to forward the message between ships. This scheme enables both the transmitting ship and the UAV to select the power control policy without relying on the jamming model and the message generation model. Instead, the policies are chosen based on the current state consisting of the distances, the received signal strength indication, the received jamming power and the bit error rate (BER). We design two dueling neutral networks respectively to select the power control policy and update the network weights to reduce the overestimation. The dueling architecture consists of two streams that estimate the value of the current state and the state-dependent advantage function of the power control policy to accelerate the learning speed. A UAV-aided anti-jamming maritime communication game is formulated and the performance bound including the BER of marine messages and the energy consumption of the transmitting ship and the UAV is derived based on the Stackelberg equilibrium.

"an unsupervised reconstruction-based fault detection algorithm for maritime components","2019","In recent years, the reliability and safety requirements of ship systems have increased drastically. This has prompted a paradigm shift toward the development of prognostics and health management (PHM) approaches for these systems' critical maritime components. In light of harsh environmental conditions with varying operational loads, and a lack of fault labels in the maritime industry generally, any PHM solution for maritime components should include independent and intelligent fault detection algorithms that can report faults automatically. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised reconstruction-based fault detection algorithm for maritime components. The advantages of the proposed algorithm are verified on five different data sets of real operational run-to-failure data provided by a highly regarded industrial company. Each data set is subject to a fault at an unknown time step. In addition, different magnitudes of random white Gaussian noise are applied to each data set in order to create several real-life situations. The results suggest that the algorithm is highly suitable to be included as part of a pure data-driven diagnostics approach in future end-to-end PHM system solutions.","maritime components,ship systems,Prediction algorithms,unsupervised learning,reliability,Maintenance engineering,deep learning,ships,Prognostics and health management,random white Gaussian noise,Gaussian noise,Fault detection,Machine learning algorithms,Degradation,condition monitoring,maritime industry,Automatic fault detection,Signal processing algorithms,remaining life assessment,intelligent fault detection algorithm,unsupervised reconstruction-based fault detection algorithm,prognostics and health management,fault diagnosis,"
"wave height prediction suitable for maritime transportation based on green ocean of things","2023","Nowadays, the application fields of the Internet of Things (IoT) involve all aspects. This article combines ocean research with the IoT, in order to investigate the wave height prediction to assist ships to improve the economy and safety of maritime transportation and proposes an ocean IoT Green Ocean of Things (GOoT) with a green and low-carbon concept. In the wave height prediction, we apply a hybrid model (EMD-TCN) combining the temporal convolutional network (TCN) and the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) to the buoy observation data. We then compare it with TCN, long short-term memory (LSTM), and hybrid model EMD-LSTM. By testing the data of eight selected NDBC buoys distributed in different sea areas, the effectiveness of the EMD-TCN hybrid model in wave height prediction is verified. The hysteresis problem in previous wave height prediction research is eliminated, while improving the accuracy of the wave height prediction. In the 24 h, 36 h, and 48 h wave height prediction, the minimum mean absolute errors are 0.1265, 0.1689, and 0.1963, respectively; the maximum coefficient of determination are 0.9388, 0.9019, and 0.8712, respectively.

"dltif: deep learning-driven cyber threat intelligence modeling and identification framework in iot-enabled maritime transportation systems","2023","The recent burgeoning of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies in the maritime industry is successfully digitalizing Maritime Transportation Systems (MTS). In IoT-enabled MTS, the smart maritime objects, infrastructure associated with ship or port communicate wirelessly using an open channel Internet. The intercommunication and incorporation of heterogeneous technologies in IoT-enabled MTS brings opportunities not only for the industries that embrace it, but also for cyber-criminals. Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) is an effective security strategy that uses artificial intelligence models to understand cyber-attacks and can protect data of IoT-enabled MTS proficiently. Unsurprisingly, most of the existing CTI-based solutions uses manual analysis to extract relevant threat information, and has low detection and high false alarm rate. Therefore, to tackle aforementioned challenges, an automated framework called DLTIF is developed for modeling cyber threat intelligence and identifying threat types. The proposed DLTIF is based on three schemes: a deep feature extractor (DFE), CTI-driven detection (CTIDD) and CTI-attack type identification (CTIATI). The DFE scheme automatically extracts the hidden patterns of IoT-enabled MTS network and its output is used by CTIDD scheme for threat detection. The CTIATI scheme is designed to identify the exact threat types and to assist security analysts in giving early warning and adopt defensive strategies.

At the same time, our intuition is that ground truth is a powerful tool for optimizing the global network. In this paper, we give solutions through these two aspects using superior guidance and aligned fusion strategy. Aligned fusion provides symmetric and fine-grained fusion strategy when using encoder-decoder structured network, and superior guidance enforce the segmentation network grasp the discrimination criterion much earlier before output part of the network.

"anomaly detection with unknown anomalies: application to maritime machinery","2021","We present a framework for deriving anomaly detection algorithms on timeseries data when the time and expression of anomalous behaviour is unknown. The framework is suited for problems in which individual machine learning paradigms cannot be directly implemented: supervised learning is not applicable due to the lack of labelled data, unsupervised learning is not effective since the normal operations are insufficiently defined and take complex and diverse forms, and deep learning risks confusing problematic behaviours for expected ones due to the possible repetitiveness of similar anomalies. The proposed approach is comprised of two phases: unsupervised discovery of anomalies, and semi-supervised construction and tuning of the anomaly detection algorithm. By leveraging data exploration methods and expert knowledge, the resulting algorithms are interpretable and detect a wide range of anomalous behaviours. The approach is applied to the early detection of wear and tear of maritime propulsion and manoeuvring machinery. We show that the final algorithm is able to detect different types of anomalies, including an actual internal leakage in a thruster which is otherwise overlooked by the present rule-based alarm system.","diagnosis,predictive maintenance,condition-based monitoring,machine learning,anomaly detection,grey-box modelling,fault detection,"
"mkcl: medical knowledge with contrastive learning model for radiology report generation","2023","Automatic radiology report generation has the potential to alert inexperienced radiologists to misdiagnoses or missed diagnoses and improve healthcare delivery efficiency by reducing the documentation workload of radiologists. Motivated by the continuous development of automatic image captioning, more and more deep learning methods have been proposed for automatic radiology report generation. However, the visual and textual data bias problem still face many challenges in the medical domain. Additionally, do not integrate medical knowledge, ignoring the mutual influences between medical findings, and abundant unlabeled medical images influence the accuracy of generating report. In this paper, we propose a Medical Knowledge with Contrastive Learning model (MKCL) to enhance radiology report generation. The proposed model MKCL uses IU Medical Knowledge Graph (IU-MKG) to mine the relationship among medical findings and improve the accuracy of identifying positive diseases findings from radiologic medical images. In particular, we design Knowledge Enhanced Attention (KEA), which integrates the IU-MKG and the extracted chest radiological visual features to alleviate textual data bias. Meanwhile, this paper leverages supervised contrastive learning to relieve radiographic medical images which have not been labeled, and identify abnormalities from images. Experimental results on the public dataset IU X-ray show that our proposed model MKCL outperforms other state-of-the-art report generation methods. Ablation studies also demonstrate that IU medical knowledge graph module and supervised contrastive learning module enhance the ability of the model to detect the abnormal parts and accurately describe the abnormal findings.

"a contextual hybrid model for vessel movement prediction","2021","Predicting the movement of the vessels can significantly improve the management of safety. While the movement can be a function of geographic contexts, the current systems and methods rarely incorporate contextual information into the analysis. This paper initially proposes a novel context-aware trajectoriesâ€™ simplification method to embed the effects of geographic context which guarantees the logical consistency of the compressed trajectories, and further suggests a hybrid method that is built upon a curvilinear model and deep neural networks. The proposed method employs contextual information to check the logical consistency of the curvilinear method and then, constructs a Context-aware Long Short-Term Memory (CLSTM) network that can take into account contextual variables, such as the vessel types. The proposed method can enhance the prediction accuracy while maintaining the logical consistency, through a recursive feedback loop. The implementations of the proposed approach on the Automatic Identification System (AIS) dataset, from the eastern coast of the United States of America which was collected, from November to December 2017, demonstrates the effectiveness and better compression, i.e. 80% compression ratio while maintaining the logical consistency. The estimated compressed trajectories are 23% more similar to their original trajectories compared to currently used simplification methods.

"modulation recognition in maritime multipath channels: a blind equalization-aided deep learning approach","2020","Modulation recognition has been long investigated in the literature, however, the performance could be severely degraded in multipath fading channels especially for high-order Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) signals. This could be a critical problem in the broadband maritime wireless communications, where various propagation paths with large differences in the time of arrival are very likely to exist. Specifically, multiple paths may stem from the direct path, the reflection paths from the rough sea surface, and the refraction paths from the atmospheric duct, respectively. To address this issue, we propose a novel blind equalization-aided deep learning (DL) approach to recognize QAM signals in the presence of multipath propagation. The proposed approach consists of two modules: A blind equalization module and a subsequent DL network which employs the structure of ResNet. With predefined searching step-sizes for the blind equalization algorithm, which are designed according to the set of modulation formats of interest, the DL network is trained and tested over various multipath channel parameter settings. It is shown that as compared to the conventional DL approaches without equalization, the proposed method can achieve an improvement in the recognition accuracy up to 30% in severe multipath scenarios, especially in the high SNR regime.

"intelligent anomaly detection of trajectories for iot empowered maritime transportation systems","2023","The convergence of Maritime Transportation Systems (MTS) and Internet of Things (IoT) has led to the promising IoT-empowered MTS (IoT-MTS). However, abnormal trajectories of maritime transportation ships can have highly negative impacts on the management of IoT-MTS.

"deeptracks: geopositioning maritime vehicles in video acquired from a moving platform","2021","Geopositioning and tracking a moving boat at sea is a very challenging problem, requiring boat detection, matching and estimating its GPS location from imagery with no common features. The problem can be stated as follows: given imagery from a camera mounted on a moving platform with known GPS location as the only valid sensor, we predict the geoposition of a target boat visible in images. Our solution uses recent ML algorithms, the camera-scene geometry and Bayesian filtering. The proposed pipeline first detects and tracks the target boatâ€™s location in the image with the strategy of tracking by detection. This image location is then converted to geoposition to the local sea coordinates referenced to the camera GPS location using plane projective geometry. Finally, target boat local coordinates are transformed to global GPS coordinates to estimate the geoposition. To achieve a smooth geotrajectory, we apply unscented Kalman filter (UKF) which implicitly overcomes small detection errors in the early stages of the pipeline.

To do so, five classical machine learning methods (i.e., Kalman Filter, Gaussian Process Regression, Support Vector Regression, Random Forest, and Back Propagation Network) and eight deep learning methods (i.e., Recurrent Neural Networks, Long Short-Term Memory, Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory, Gate Recurrent Unit, Bi-directional Gate Recurrent Unit, Sequence to Sequence, Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network, and Transformer) are thoroughly analysed and compared from the algorithm essence and applications to excavate their features and adaptability for manned and unmanned ships. The findings reveal the characteristics of various prediction methods and provide valuable implications for different stakeholders to guide the best-fit choice of a particular method as the solution under a specific circumstance. It also makes contributions to the extraction of the research difficulties of ship trajectory prediction and the corresponding solutions that are put forward to guide the development of future research.","Deep learning,Maritime safety,Hybrid maritime traffic,Trajectory prediction,AIS data,Machine learning,"
"monitoring maritime traffic with ship detection via yolov4","2022","In India a large part of goods transportation is carried out by sea, leading to an emerging requirement for remote maritime patrolling system, which also serves as an asset during wartime and peacetime for defence. In this research paper, we propose an automated maritime patrolling solution by making a Deep Learning Model Pipeline for Ship Detection from satellite images using existing State of the art Object Detection Algorithms like Faster-RCNN, SSD, YOLOv3, and YOLOv4.

"transfer learning for maritime vessel detection using deep neural networks","2021","Reliable vessel detection can improve safety and security in maritime environment. Recently, application of Deep Learning (DL)-based detectors have become popular in autonomous vehicles. The aim of this paper is to study how much a pretrained DL model on a domain-specific marine data can improve the performance of the detectors for vessel detection? To this end, we trained state-of-the-art DL-based detectors (Faster R-CNN [1], R-FCN [2] and SSD [3]) using an open source generic object detection COCO dataset [4] and a marine SeaShips dataset [5]. The performance of these detectors are explored based on different feature extractors. Moreover, we investigate the effect of object size on the detection accuracy. To obtain results, we collected a real marine dataset by a sensor system onboard a vessel in the Finnish archipelago. This system is used for developing autonomous vessels, and records data in a range of operation and climatic conditions. The experimental results show that Faster R-CNN with ResNet101 achieves the highest object detection accuracy with mean average precision of 75.2%.","marine dataset,reliable vessel detection,Safety,deep learning (artificial intelligence),domain-specific marine data,Sensor systems,open source generic object detection COCO dataset,Feature extraction,maritime vessel detection,public domain software,Transfer learning,deep neural networks,object detection,autonomous vehicles,autonomous underwater vehicles,feature extraction,marine SeaShips dataset,feature extractors,Deep learning,Object detection,pretrained DL model,transfer learning,autonomous vessels,Detectors,"
"siamfpn: a deep learning method for accurate and real-time maritime ship tracking","2021","Visual object tracking plays an essential role in various maritime applications. However, most of the existing tracking methods belong to generative models, which only focus on the features of the object and require the target has significant visual saliency for accurate tracking. While the visual saliency is available in most of the common tracking conditions, these methods may fail when facing challenging situations. In this paper, a deep learning based tracking method is proposed to track maritime ships, namely, SiamFPN. In SiamFPN, a modified Siamese Network is combined with multi-RPNs to build a tracking pipeline. Concretely, A ResNet-50 with an FPN structure is used as the CNN of the detection subnetwork of Siamese, and a template subnetwork is parallel to the detection. In order to strengthen the discriminative ability, three RPNs are deployed to process the output of Siamese Network. Moreover, a historical impacts based proposal selection method is developed for selecting correct target areas. Finally, a dataset is collected for training and testing SiamFPN and validating our excellent performance over the other four recent SOTA trackers. Based on the experimental results, we achieved 74 % on average accuracy with real-time speed.","modified Siamese Network,region proposal network,Cameras,Marine vehicles,maritime ships,significant visual saliency,proposal selection method,image representation,target tracking,Visual tracking,object tracking,ships,Target tracking,Proposals,object detection,SiamFPN,Radar tracking,Correlation,maritime applications,deep learning based tracking method,maritime environment,common tracking conditions,Visualization,tracking pipeline,existing tracking methods,Siamese network,visual object tracking,correct target areas,learning (artificial intelligence),tracking,"
"wasrâ€”a water segmentation and refinement maritime obstacle detection network","2022","Obstacle detection using semantic segmentation has become an established approach in autonomous vehicles. However, existing segmentation methods, primarily developed for ground vehicles, are inadequate in an aquatic environment as they produce many false positive (FP) detections in the presence of water reflections and wakes. We propose a novel deep encoderâ€“decoder architecture, a water segmentation and refinement (WaSR) network, specifically designed for the marine environment to address these issues. A deep encoder based on ResNet101 with atrous convolutions enables the extraction of rich visual features, while a novel decoder gradually fuses them with inertial information from the inertial measurement unit (IMU). The inertial information greatly improves the segmentation accuracy of the water component in the presence of visual ambiguities, such as fog on the horizon. Furthermore, a novel loss function for semantic separation is proposed to enforce the separation of different semantic components to increase the robustness of the segmentation. We investigate different loss variants and observe a significant reduction in FPs and an increase in true positives (TPs). Experimental results show that WaSR outperforms the current state of the art by approximately 4% in F1 score on a challenging unmanned surface vehicle dataset. WaSR shows remarkable generalization capabilities and outperforms the state of the art by over 24% in F1 score on a strict domain generalization experiment.","separation loss,Semantic segmentation,Neural Networks,remotely operated vehicles,semantic segmentation,different loss variants,ResNet101,water component,unmanned surface vehicles (USVs),Feature extraction,marine environment,novel decoder,water reflections,Image Processing,WaSR-a water segmentation,novel loss function,atrous convolutions,false positive detections,ground vehicles,inertial measurement unit,computer vision,autonomous vehicles,feature extraction,Computer,challenging unmanned surface vehicle dataset,different semantic components,positives,wakes,obstacle detection,segmentation accuracy,inertial information,Water,Image segmentation,established approach,Autonomous vehicles,mobile robots,Deep learning,aquatic environment,deep encoder-decoder architecture,refinement maritime obstacle detection network,Computer-Assisted,image segmentation,collision avoidance,existing segmentation methods,learning (artificial intelligence),visual ambiguities,refinement network,rich visual features,semantic separation,"
"infrared small dim target detection under maritime near seaâ€“sky line based on regional-division local contrast measure","2023","Infrared (IR) small dim target detection near the seaâ€“sky line (SSL) is crucial for enhancing the early warning capability of maritime vehicles. However, the interferences caused by the strong contrast have not been properly addressed. Consequently, a specially designed algorithm regional-division local contrast measure (RDLCM) that focuses on the detection of IR small dim targets appearing near the SSL is proposed. First, an SSL detection module based on a lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) is devised to achieve fast pixel-level SSL detection. Then, a set of regional-division windows (RDWs) are designed according to the strong grayscale contrast distribution around the SSL, and through the division of the effective regions, the RDWs could realize the potential extraction and refinement of the IR small dim targets that appear near the SSL. Experiments on three IR image sequences demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves the best detection accuracy among the classical and state-of-the-art algorithms in comparison and runs at 44 frames per second (FPS), which could meet real-time requirements. The code and dataset are available at RDLCM.","Sea measurements,Convolutional neural network (CNN),infrared (IR) small dim target detection,Gray-scale,Velocity measurement,sea-sky line (SSL),Object detection,Geoscience and remote sensing,Real-time systems,Junctions,local contrast measure (LCM),"
"geotracknetâ€”a maritime anomaly detector using probabilistic neural network representation of ais tracks and a contrario detection","2022","Representing maritime traffic patterns and detecting anomalies from them are key to vessel monitoring and maritime situational awareness. We propose a novel approachâ€”referred to as GeoTrackNetâ€”for maritime anomaly detection from AIS data streams. Our model exploits state-of-the-art neural network schemes to learn a probabilistic representation of AIS tracks and a contrario detection to detect abnormal events. The neural network provides a new means to capture complex and heterogeneous patterns in vesselsâ€™ behaviours, while the a contrario detector takes into account the fact that the learnt distribution may be location-dependent.

"lmd-tshipâ‹†: vision based large-scale maritime ship tracking benchmark for autonomous navigation applications","2021","Accurate ship tracking is very important for the security of maritime activities, especially the raising requirements of autonomous navigation applications, e.g., autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs). Unlike deep-learning-based object-tracking methods are prevailing in autonomous driving because of good environmental robustness and high tracking accuracy, few deep-tracking models can be found for maritime ships. The main reason for that is the lack of qualified ship datasets, especially datasets with ship-based perspectives. Therefore, a large-scale, high-definition dataset for ship tracking, LMD-TShip (Large Maritime Dataset), is provided in this paper. In this dataset, five types of ships are included, from cargo ships, fishing ships, passenger ships, and speed boats to unmanned ships. Specifically, LMD-TShip consists of 40,240 frames in 191 videos, each of which is carefully and manually annotated with bounding boxes in YOLO format. Moreover, 13 attributes are used to label videos, e.g., scale variation (SV), occlusion (OCC), basically covering tracking challenges of maritime ship tracking. Next, a detailed analysis is carried out to demonstrate the characteristics of LMD-TShip. Finally, experiments with five baseline short-term tracking models on the dataset are performed, e.g., ECO, SiamRPN++, and the experimental results demonstrate its good evaluation ability, which will provide effective means for training and testing tracking models related to maritime ships.","LMD-TShip,speed boats,Hidden Markov models,YOLO format,Cameras,Marine vehicles,tracking accuracy,cargo ships,ship tracking dataset,Videos,Visual tracking,video annotation,object tracking,ships,maritime activities security,Biological system modeling,unmanned ships,boats,Target tracking,object detection,deep-learning-based object-tracking methods,image annotation,Radar tracking,autonomous surface vehicles,telerobotics,autonomous driving,video signal processing,maritime environment,unmanned surface vehicles,mobile robots,passenger ships,deep-tracking models,vision based large-scale maritime ship tracking benchmark,autonomous navigation,fishing ships,Large Maritime Dataset,autonomous navigation applications,"
"automated monitoring in maritime video surveillance system","2020","Maritime surveillance for intruders/illegal activities requires monitoring of a large area of the coastline. This task being manually exhaustive, would benefit immensely by application of object detection techniques to surveillance videos. However, object detection models trained on general objects datasets cannot be expected to give best performance for this scenario as marine vessels are only a small subset of these huge datasets and also do not classify the specific type of sea vehicle. Hence, their benchmarks are not appropriate for maritime surveillance. Some studies have been done with applications of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for ship/boat detection on private and publicly available sea vessels datasets. This paper presents a summary of the benchmarks so far and presents our experiments of the latest object detection techniques for combined marine vessels dataset. A survey of the currently available datasets is also given. Results of our experiments in terms of mean Average Precision (mAP) and Frames Per Second (FPS) are presented.","Benchmark testing,object detection models,surveillance videos,sea vehicle,computerised monitoring,Meteorology,Videos,ships,marine engineering,Marine vessel identification,boats,object detection,Intruder detection,Video surveillance,convolutional neural nets,convolutional neural networks,general objects datasets,private sea vessels datasets,automated monitoring,Ship detection,Deep learning,Object detection,Computational modeling,Task analysis,video surveillance,marine vessels dataset,maritime video surveillance,"
"a novel hybrid approach for detecting abnormal vessel behavior in maritime traffic","2023","The Abnormal Behavior Detection of Vessels (ABVD) is crucial for enhancing Vesselsâ€™ situational awareness as well as achieving effective management of maritime traffic. Clustering algorithms are extensively employed for ABVD tasks, however, they are not only time-consuming but also frequently inaccurate when dealing with complex and dynamic vessel trajectory detection tasks. To address the above problems, we propose a novel hybrid approach, CSDLSTM(Course/Speed-DBSCAN and LSTM), which combines Density-based Clustering(DBSCAN) and long short-term memory networks to improve the efficiency of ABVD. Specifically, a three-dimensional CS-DBSCAN (Course/Speed-DBSCAN) algorithm is proposed, which incorporates speed and course features along with geospatial information in the clustering process to accurately describe vessel behavior. In addition, the clustering results are used as traffic patterns to train the LSTM predictor for real-time maritime anomaly detection. Experiments conducted on real AIS datasets demonstrate that the CSD-LSTM method has greater precision and efficiency in ABVD.","Traffic control,Transportation,Clustering algorithms,LSTM,Prediction algorithms,CS-DBSCAN,Sensitivity,Real-time systems,Heuristic algorithms,abnormal vessel behavior,"
"leveraging graph and deep learning uncertainties to detect anomalous maritime trajectories","2022","Understanding and representing traffic patterns are key to detecting anomalous trajectories in the transportation domain. However, some trajectories can exhibit heterogeneous maneuvering characteristics despite confining to normal patterns. Thus, we propose a novel graph-based trajectory representation and association scheme for extraction and confederation of traffic movement patterns, such that data patterns and uncertainty can be learned by deep learning (DL) models. This paper proposes the usage of a recurrent neural network (RNN)-based evidential regression model, which can predict trajectory at future timesteps as well as estimate the data and model uncertainties associated, to detect anomalous maritime trajectories, such as unusual vessel maneuvering, using automatic identification system (AIS) data. Furthermore, we utilize evidential deep learning classifiers to detect unusual turns of vessels and the loss of transmitted signal using predicted class probabilities with associated uncertainties. Our experimental results suggest that the graphical representation of traffic patterns improves the ability of the DL models, such as evidential and Monte Carlo dropout, to learn the temporal-spatial correlation of data and associated uncertainties. Using different datasets and experiments, we demonstrate that the estimated prediction uncertainty yields fundamental information for the detection of traffic anomalies in the maritime and, possibly in other domains.","Monte Carlo methods,classification,recurrent neural nets,graph,deep learning (artificial intelligence),Anomaly detection,DL models,graph-based trajectory representation,automatic identification system data,Monte Carlo dropout,graphical representation,traffic movement patterns,detect anomalous maritime trajectories,Predictive models,regression analysis,evidential deep learning,marine engineering,Data models,data patterns,pattern classification,Artificial intelligence,graph theory,RNN,regression,clustering,uncertainty,Trajectory,Uncertainty,probability,Computational modeling,traffic engineering computing,recurrent neural network-based evidential regression model,deep learning uncertainties,AIS data,"
