"modeling and application of global maritime transport accessibility based on probability distribution","2023","The study of sea area accessibility is often overlooked despite the fact that vessel routesâ€™ density at sea can reflect human activity patterns. Using AIS point data for 2014 and 2018, this paper constructed global daily vessel routes and applied the kernel density estimation method to obtain the probability distribution function of route density for over 700,000 sea grids under a global 0.25Â° regular grid. An accessibility model for sea areas was then proposed and applied to the grid, resulting in the accessibility assessment of global sea areas in 2014 and 2018. The results indicated that the average global maritime accessibility value increased from 5.2% in 2014 to 14.4% in 2018. Accessibility to various international trade routes, such as those through the Cape of Good Hope and polar regions, significantly increased. However, accessibility to sea areas such as the Mediterranean and sea areas near the Pacific Islands decreased. This study explored the temporal and spatial variation of maritime traffic accessibility, which could enhance our understanding of global vessel activity characteristics and guide maritime rescue resource allocation, marine species protection, and marine spatial planning.","AD 2018,kernel density estimation method,Kernel,global sea areas,Marine vehicles,regular grid,accessibility assessment,Accessibility,sea grids,kernel density estimation,Maritime communications,AD 2014,Spatial databases,route density,maritime transport,AIS,Seaports,Density measurement,average global maritime accessibility value,maritime traffic accessibility,Probability distribution,probability distribution function,Artificial intelligence,Cape of Good Hope,global daily vessel routes,international trade routes,global vessel activity characteristics,Trajectory,human activity patterns,global maritime transport accessibility,accessibility model,sea area accessibility,Estimation,AIS point data,oceanographic techniques,"

"gpu-accelerated compression and visualization of large-scale vessel trajectories in maritime iot industries","2020","The automatic identification system (AIS), an automatic vessel-tracking system, has been widely adopted to perform intelligent traffic management and collision avoidance services in maritime Internet-of-Things (IoT) industries. With the rapid development of maritime transportation, tremendous numbers of AIS-based vessel trajectory data have been collected, which make trajectory data compression imperative and challenging. This article mainly focuses on the compression and visualization of large-scale vessel trajectories and their graphics processing unit (GPU)-accelerated implementations. The visualization was implemented to investigate the influence of compression on vessel trajectory data quality. In particular, the Douglas-Peucker (DP) and kernel density estimation (KDE) algorithms, respectively, utilized for trajectory compression and visualization, were significantly accelerated through the massively parallel computation capabilities of the GPU architecture. Comprehensive experiments on trajectory compression and visualization have been conducted on large-scale AIS data of recording ship movements collected from three different water areas, i.e., the South Channel of Yangtze River Estuary, the Chengshan Jiao Promontory, and the Zhoushan Islands. Experimental results illustrated that: 1) the proposed GPU-based parallel implementation frameworks could significantly reduce the computational time for both trajectory compression and visualization; 2) the influence of compressed vessel trajectories on trajectory visualization could be negligible if the compression threshold was selected suitably; and 3) the Gaussian kernel was capable of generating more appropriate KDE-based visualization performance by comparing with other seven kernel functions.","trajectory compression,Douglas-Peucker algorithm,vessel trajectory data quality,trajectory visualization,Internet of Things,Industries,GPU-accelerated compression,large-scale vessel trajectories,data visualisation,Acceleration,compression threshold,vessel trajectory,parallel computing,ships,KDE-based visualization,marine safety,kernel density estimation,marine engineering,GPU-based parallel implementation frameworks,maritime transportation,graphics processing units,automatic identification system,collision avoidance services,maritime IoT industries,intelligent traffic management,compressed vessel trajectories,KDE algorithm,Artificial intelligence,AIS-based vessel trajectory data,data compression,Data visualization,graphics processing unit (GPU),graphics processing unit,Graphics processing units,Trajectory,maritime Internet-of-Things industries,large-scale AIS data,marine vehicles,automatic vessel-tracking system,"
"maritime traffic probabilistic forecasting based on vesselsâ€™ waterway patterns and motion behaviors","2017","Maritime traffic prediction is critical for ocean transportation safety management. In this paper, we propose a novel knowledge assisted methodology for maritime traffic forecasting based on a vessel's waterway pattern and motion behavior. The vessel's waterway pattern is extracted through a proposed lattice-based DBSCAN algorithm that significantly reduces the problem scale, and its motion behavior is quantitatively modeled for the first time using kernel density estimation. The proposed methodology facilitates the knowledge extraction, storage, and retrieval, allowing for seamless knowledge transfer to support maritime traffic forecasting. By incorporating both the vessel's waterway pattern and motion behavior knowledge, our solution suggests a set of probable coordinates with the corresponding probability as the forecasting output. The proposed forecasting algorithm is capable of accurately predicting maritime traffic 5, 30, and 60 min ahead, while its computation can be efficiently completed in milliseconds for single vessel prediction. Owing to such a high computational efficiency, an extensive predictive analysis of hundreds of vessels has been reported for the first time in this paper. A web-based prototype platform is implemented for Singapore waters to demonstrate the solution's feasibility in a real-world maritime operation system. The proposed approaches can be generalized for other marine waters around the world.","vessel waterway patterns,data mining,Transportation,maritime traffic,maritime operation system,Prediction algorithms,marine transportation,single vessel prediction,transportation,knowledge transfer,Planning,forecasting theory,Stability analysis,ocean transportation safety management,lattice-based DBSCAN algorithm,vessel motion behaviors,knowledge engineering,forecasting algorithm,kernel density estimation,marine engineering,pattern clustering,Artificial intelligence,Forecasting,maritime traffic probabilistic forecasting,motion behavior knowledge,knowledge extraction,probability,knowledge acquisition,traffic engineering computing,maritime traffic prediction,Data mining,knowledge discovery,knowledge assisted methodology,"
"mapping dark shipping zones using multi-temporal sar and ais data for maritime domain awareness","2022","The monitoring of ships which do not report their Au-tomatic Identification System (AIS) information is important for Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA). In this paper, an improved maritime picture is generated by presenting a new methodology to map these so-called â€˜darkâ€™ ships over time. Firstly, a robust and accurate data association between Syn-thetic Aperture Radar (SAR) ship detections and AIS data is carried out on multi-temporal SAR imagery and AIS data. Subsequently, Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) is applied to unassigned SAR ship detections to reveal the spatial distri-bution of â€˜darkâ€™ zones (i.e. areas where repeated unassign-ments occur). This analysis helps identify areas where ships frequently do not report, which can help guide authorities in the best way to respond. The methodology is validated using Sentinel-l Interferometric Wide (IW) swath mode products and AIS data acquired from the English Channel, UK.","Automatic Identification System information,remote sensing by radar,ship detection,Marine vehicles,dark zones,dark ships,Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA),Sea measurements,Rocks,ships,Maritime Domain Awareness,AIS,dark shipping zones mapping,synthetic aperture radar,radar imaging,Artificial intelligence,Radar polarimetry,oceanographic regions,Syn-thetic Aperture Radar ship detections,GIS,multi-temporal SAR,data association,Radar imaging,unassigned SAR ship detections,multitemporal SAR imagery,AIS data,Radar detection,"
"vessel sailing route extraction and analysis from satellite-based ais data using density clustering and probability algorithms","2023","The vessel Automatic Identification System (AIS) data collected by satellites have the features of large coverage area and large data volume, and they are instantaneous discrete data rather than time-continuous data, so the data has large dispersion with many noise points. This poses a challenge for vessel sailing route extraction. This paper proposes a vessel sailing route extraction method which consists of the fast Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm and the Kernel Density Estimation-based Outlier Factor (KDE-based OF) noise reduction algorithm. The method in this paper firstly improves the clustering discrimination method in the DBSCAN algorithm to separate trajectories in different directions. Secondly, this paper extracts a fast clustering algorithm based on the density clustering algorithm to reduce its computing time overhead with satellite big data. Finally, this paper proposes the KDE-based OF processing algorithm, which calculates the outlier probability distribution value of the trajectory points through the algorithm to eliminate the edge trajectory points with low probability distribution. Based on the actual satellite vessel AIS data, this paper conducts multi-method comparisons and performance analysis experiments. Experiments show that the proposed method has the best stability and advancement.","Vessel sailing route extraction,Kernel Density Estimation-based Outlier Factor (KDE-based OF),Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN),Automatic Identification System (AIS),"
"fitting empirical distributions for vessels behavioural analysis and maritime anomaly detection","2023","Naval behaviour characterization and maritime anomaly detection represents two active area of research. Although multiple probabilistic approaches have been implemented for explaining different parametric maritime phenomena, most of them are focused only on the analysis of primary kinematic data, such as position, speed, course of vessels, or lateral displacement relative to an obstacle. This article presents an analysis on multiple complex maritime activities (e.g., fishing, drifting, hidden activities) that were derived by processing AIS messages collected in the Black Sea region. Quantitative histograms were made for each type of activity while probability and cumulative distribution functions were plotted using kernel density estimation applications. After that, multiple evaluation metrics analysed the possibilities of representing these distributions in the form of known parametric distributions (e.g., Gaussian, Gamma, Rayleigh, Log-normal). Finally, there were extracted the parameters that best fitted these distributions. Also, a universal parametric distribution was searched to best fit all observed maritime activities.","statistical distributions,universal parametric distribution,kernel density estimation applications,Safety,primary kinematic data,AIS messages,vessel behavioural analysis,Sea measurements,cumulative distribution functions,parametric maritime phenomena,probabilistic approaches,quantitative histograms,marine engineering,hidden activities,AIS,vessels behaviour,Probabilistic logic,Probability distribution,probability distribution fitting,Measurement,maritime anomaly detection,Statistical analysis,empirical distributions,naval behaviour characterization,Fitting,Black Sea region,empirical data,data handling,multiple complex maritime activities,"
"trajectory prediction for marine vessels using historical ais heatmaps and long short-term memory networks⁎⁎this research is sponsored by the danish innovation fund, the danish maritime fund, orients fund and the lauritzen foundation through the autonomy part of the shippinglab project, grant number 8090-00063b.","2021","Estimating the trajectory of other vessels is essential when navigating a marine vessel, both as a human navigator and as a machine. By estimating the trajectories of other vessels, sub-systems such as collision avoidance algorithms can plan ahead accordingly in order to avoid conflicts. To estimate the trajectories of other vessels, the use of Automatic Identification System (AIS) is a good candidate data-point, as this is becoming increasingly more common, and in some cases even mandated, on-board vessels. This paper presents a data-driven approach that uses the historical AIS data within a selected area in the Danish waters. The historical data is transformed into a probabilistic heat map using Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), and is further encoded using a Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE) before entered into the estimation scheme. The estimation scheme consists of a Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) model, in a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) configuration, which is sampled multiple times, yielding a single trajectory prediction with uncertainty. The performance of the estimation scheme is demonstrated and compared against two other commonly used methods, showing that the probabilistic heat map provides valuable information, compared to the baseline methods.","Autonomous Navigation,AIS Data,Machine Learning,Autonomous Marine Vessels,Trajectory Prediction,"
"evaluation and comparison of anomaly detection algorithms in annotated datasets from the maritime domain","2015","Anomaly detection supports human decision makers in their surveillance tasks to ensure security. To gain the trust of the operator, it is important to develop a robust system, which gives the operator enough insight to take a rational choice about future steps. In this work, the maritime domain is investigated. Here, anomalies occur in trajectory data. Hence, a normal model for the trajectories has to be estimated. Despite the goal of anomaly detection in real life operations, until today, mostly simulated anomalies have been evaluated to measure the performance of different algorithms. Therefore, an annotation tool is developed to provide a ground truth on a non-simulative dataset. The annotated data is used to compare different algorithms with each other. For the given dataset, first experiments are conducted with the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and the Kernel Density Estimator (KDE). For the evaluation of the algorithms, precision, recall, and f1-score are compared.","surveillance,GMM,Clustering algorithms,Hidden Markov models,Intelligent systems,Anomaly detection,Gaussian Mixture Model,trajectory data,annotation tool,human decision making,operator trust,Sea measurements,nonsimulative dataset,mixture models,kernel density estimator,marine engineering,Gaussian processes,recall value,ground truth,maritime domain,robust system,Maritime domain,f1-score value,Kernel Density Estimation,Gaussian mixture model,annotated datasets,Trajectory,surveillance tasks,anomaly detection algorithms,Surveillance,normal model,precision value,KDE,"

"maritime traffic route detection framework based on statistical density analysis from ais data using a clustering algorithm","2022","Maritime traffic routes by ships navigation vary according to country and geographic characteristics, and they differ according to the characteristics of the ships. In ocean areas adjacent to coasts, regulated routes are present, e.g., traffic separation scheme for ships entering and leaving; however, most ocean areas do not have such routes. Maritime traffic route research has been conducted based on computer engineering to create routes; however, ship characteristics were not considered. Thus, this article proposes a framework to generate maritime traffic routes using statistical density analysis. Here, automatic identification system (AIS) data are used to derive quantitative traffic routes. Preprocessing is applied to the AIS data, and a similar ship trajectory pattern is decomposed into a matrix based on the Hausdorffâ€“distance algorithm and then stored in a database. A similar pattern makes the AIS trajectory simple using the Douglasâ€“Peucker algorithm. In addition, density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) is performed to identify the waypoints of vessels then create routes by connecting waypoints. The width of maritime routes created based on a similar ship trajectory is subjected to kernel density estimation analysis (KDE). Then, waypoints evaluation of the main route is performed from the results of KDE 75% and 90% considering the statistical in the total maritime traffic, and the results applied to the targeted ocean area are compared. Finally, the result of KDE 90% of maritime traffic with framework analyzed the safety route, which can be a basis for developing routes for maritime autonomous surface ships.","traffic separation scheme,ocean areas,marine accidents,Clustering algorithms,Safety,targeted ocean area,Douglas-Peucker algorithm,automatic identification system data,vehicle routing,total maritime traffic,Marine vehicles,maritime autonomous surface ships,quantitative traffic routes,geographic characteristics,DBSCAN,statistical analysis,ships,marine safety,kernel density estimation,AIS trajectory simple,maritime traffic route detection framework,kernel density estimation analysis,Oceans,Hausdorff-distance algorithm,ship trajectory pattern,framework,pattern clustering,Artificial intelligence,statistical density analysis,marine engineering computing,Trajectory,ship characteristics,maritime traffic route research,Navigation,safety route,density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise,clustering algorithm,AIS data,maritime traffic route,"
