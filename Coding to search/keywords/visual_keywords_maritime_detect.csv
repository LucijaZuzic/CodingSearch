"dual-band slotted waveguide antenna array for communication, maritime navigation and surveillance radar","2015","This paper describes the development of a dualband slotted waveguide antenna for communication, navigation and surveillance radar applications. Two different slot sizes on opposite faces are designed for enabling antenna operation over two different frequency bands. In this way, it becomes possible to perform diverse sorts of tracking using a unique structure. Numerical results, obtained using ANSYS HFSS, demonstrate the proposed antenna provides two bandwidths of approximately 15% and 6.5% for S-band and C-band, respectively. The antenna gain varies from 12.7dBi at 2.2 GHz to 16.37dBi at 4.6GHz.","multifrequency antennas,C-band,Radar antennas,Antenna arrays,gain 16.37 dB,slot antenna arrays,ANSYS HFSS,dual-band slotted waveguide antenna array,maritime navigation,search radar,S-band,Radar,Slot antennas,Electromagnetic waveguides,radionavigation,bandwidth 4.6 GHz,bandwidth 2.2 GHz,numerical analysis,surveillance radar,gain 12.7 dB,Arrays,"
"adaptation to the clutter environment by airborne maritime surveillance radars","2001","Airborne maritime surveillance radars must detect small targets against a background of sea clutter whilst maintaining surveillance over a large area of sea. This task is very demanding and requires the radar to dynamically adapt to the local environment in order to obtain the best possible detection sensitivity. An aircraft flying at, say 3000 ft would be able to observe an area of sea of about 49,000 km, with a range to the horizon of about 124 km. Over this area, the clutter characteristics observed the radar will be continuously changing as a function of range and look direction. These characteristics will vary in a manner dependent on the prevailing conditions, the radar characteristics and the viewing geometry. In practice, the radar must cope with a very wide dynamic range of signal amplitude, with amplitude statistics varying from those of thermal noise to very spiky sea clutter and land. Continuous adaptation to this environment is required as a function of range and bearing. The dynamic behaviour of the radar as it adapts in this way is often a much more relevant measure of performance than more traditional static measures such as detection range. Methods used to adapt to the environment are surveyed in this paper, together with indications of how their dynamic behaviour can influence performance.","airborne radar,radar characteristics,sea clutter,military radar,viewing geometry,search radar,airborne maritime surveillance radars,marine radar,signal amplitude,radar detection,prevailing conditions,radar clutter,detection sensitivity,dynamic behaviour,small targets,amplitude statistics,"
"maritime anomaly detection in a real-world scenario: ever given grounding in the suez canal","2022","In this paper we present how automatic maritime anomaly detection tools can be successfully applied in real-world situations such as the major event of the container vessel Ever Given, which grounded in the Suez Canal on March 23rd 2021. The anomaly detector is designed to process the available sequence of Automatic Identification System (AIS) reports, information from ground-based or satellite radar systems if available, and contextual information defining the expected nominal behavior of navigation. A statistical hypothesis testing procedure is sequentially run to decide whether or not a deviation from the nominal behavior happened within a specific time period, for instance two consecutive data points. We show, based on the recorded AIS data from the Ever Given, that the proposed detector could have been triggered and alerted to anomalous behavior fully 19 minutes before the grounding.","anomaly detector,Anomaly detection,Marine vehicles,Grounding,statistical hypothesis testing,Ever Given grounding,automatic maritime anomaly detection tools,statistical analysis,Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process,Testing,ships,Containers,automatic identification system,radar,maritime surveillance,satellite radar systems,contextual information,container vessel,Suez Canal,Artificial intelligence,ground-based system,marine engineering computing,Maritime anomaly detection,Irrigation,statistical hypothesis testing procedure,expected nominal behavior,AIS data,"
"fusion detection algorithm of maritime radar and electro-optical pod for complex sea conditions","2023","In order to improve the perceptual capability of Unmanned Surface Vessels (USVs) in complex sea conditions, a fusion detection algorithm has been developed that combines maritime radar and electro-optical (EO) pod. This algorithm integrates the positional state of the USV, class information of the maritime target obtained through a vision-based target detection algorithm, and processed maritime radar information. By using Gaussian and morphological filtering, the fusion of position state information from the USV, EO pod data, and maritime radar data is achieved. This effectively mitigates the negative impact of environmental factors, such as waves and water mist, on target detection. A cooperative sensing process between the maritime radar and EO pod is proposed to fuse the data obtained from both sources, resulting in accurate comprehensive target information. Experimental results show that the fusion algorithm achieves an average accuracy of 80.24% and a detection rate of 74.7%, enabling precise detection of maritime targets, including their distance, speed, and category. This enhanced perceptual capability is essential for USVs operating in complex maritime environments, enabling better decision-making and navigation performance.","maritime radar data,class information,accurate comprehensive target information,sensor fusion,marine radar,electro-optical pod,vision-based target detection algorithm,fusion algorithm,enhanced perceptual capability,target detection,complex maritime environments,positional state,combines maritime radar,fusion detection algorithm,object detection,complex sea conditions,Collaboration,synergistic sensing,Surface morphology,Radar,position state information,Unmanned Surface Vessels,unmanned surface vehicles,detection rate,maritime radar information,Radar imaging,USVs operating,Object detection,Signal processing algorithms,EO pod,maritime target,multi-sensor fusion,Radar detection,"
"maritime situational awareness forensics tools for a common information sharing environment (cise)","2019","CISE stands for Common Information Sharing Environment and refers to an architecture and set of protocols, procedures and services for the exchange of data and information across Maritime Authorities of EU (European Union) Member States (MS's). In the context of enabling the implementation and adoption of CISE by different MS's, EU has funded a number of projects that enable the development of subsystems and adaptors intended to allow MS's to connect and make use of CISE. In this context, the Integrated Systems Laboratory (ISL) has led the development of the corresponding Hellenic and Cypriot CISE by developing a Control, Command & Information (C2I) system that unifies all partial maritime surveillance systems into one National Situational Picture Management (NSPM) system, and adaptors that allow the interconnection of the corresponding national legacy systems to CISE and the exchange of data, information and requests between the two MS's. Furthermore, a set of forensics tools that allow geospatial & time filtering and detection of anomalies, risk incidents, fake MMSIs, suspicious speed changes, collision paths, and gaps in AIS (Automatic Identification System), have been developed by combining motion models, AI, deep learning and fusion algorithms using data from different databases through CISE. This paper briefly discusses these developments within the EU CISE-2020, Hellenic CISE and CY-CISE projects and the benefits from the sharing of maritime data across CISE for both maritime surveillance and security.

"ship detection in maritime surveillance system based on yolox","2023","In this paper, we study the problem of ship target detection in maritime video surveillance systems, with special attention to the detection accuracy and adaptability under bad weather conditions. To this end, we propose an improved ship target detection method, including the addition of additive attention mechanism, and through testing on ship data sets, we verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. To further evaluate the performance of the method in severe weather conditions, we also used a flexible data enhancement strategy to generate a diverse synthetic test datasets, including different conditions such as rain, fog, and low illumination. Based on this datasets, we constructed a test datasets specifically for small vessel target detection, in which we evaluated the proposed approach. Experimental results show that compared with other mainstream competing algorithms such as Faster R-CNN, YOLOv3, YOLOv4, and YOLOX, our method has superior performance in terms of detection accuracy, robustness, and efficiency. In addition, the proposed method proves its good adaptability in ship detection under harsh imaging conditions.

"data augmentation method of object detection for deep learning in maritime image","2020","Maritime object detection is an essential element for the situational awareness in autonomous ships. Recently, as the deep learning technology evolves, the attempt that the ship recognize the surrounding environment by using deep learning technology is gradually increasing. Deep learning methods, however, require a lot of data, but lack a publicly available dataset for object detection in the maritime domain. In this paper, we proposed a data augmentation method that can automatically extend the object detection dataset in maritime image.

"target visibility estimation in a buoy mounted maritime forward scatter radar","2015","A buoy mounted maritime forward scatter radar system has been under recent experimental investigation for the detection of small, low speed, low radar cross section (low detectability) maritime targets. One of the main issues regarding target detectability in such a low grazing angle system is the actual visibility of the target due to blocking by waves, especially at higher sea states. Currently experimentation is limited mainly to the lower sea states, mostly using shore mounted antennas in littoral environments; in higher seas and indeed in deep seas with moving antennas, experimentation is more logistically challenging and so initial investigations are being performed through modelling. Thus this paper investigates target observability through consideration of line of sight for selected maritime scenarios and radar topologies for the buoy mounted maritime forward scatter radar system in deep sea conditions.","Antennas,maritime,marine radar,Surface waves,sea states,Power capacitors,littoral environments,observability,Wind speed,maritime forward scatter radar system,radar cross-sections,radar target recognition,maritime targets,Sea surface,Sea state,Radar,grazing angle system,deep sea conditions,radar cross section,visibility,target detectability,buoy mounted maritime forward scatter radar system,target visibility estimation,forward scatter radar,"
"texture anomaly detection in radar imagery","1994","A radar image of the land or sea will contain extended regions of apparently homogeneous textures arising from, for example, forested areas or uniformly driven expanses of water. However, such regions may contain subtle texture anomalies which indicate the presence of a feature of interest such as a change in tree density due to environmental effects, damping of the sea surface due to the presence of pollutants or the presence of land-based or maritime military targets. For this reason, it is of interest to develop methods of detecting anomalies in textured regions. A strategy for texture anomaly detection is to estimate the multi-variate probability density function (PDF) of a texture segment using the whole homogeneous region as training data and then to calculate the likelihood of occurrence of each individual segment within the region given the PDF estimate. Those texture segments with anomalous likelihood values can then be flagged as potential texture anomalies.<>","Image texture analysis,radar imagery,PDF estimate,image texture,texture segment,Statistics,statistical analysis,texture anomaly detection,multi-variate probability density,Radar,radar image,texture segments,radar,"
"fast and parameter-light rare behavior detection in maritime trajectories","2020","Rare behaviors indicate important events and situations in maritime surveillance applications. State-of-the-art methods provide many effective solutions to detect anomalous behaviors. Meanwhile, most solutions are parameter-laden and too costly to identify useful rare behaviors with human knowledge in a visual analytics manner. This paper is concerned with a scheme cross trajectories, vessel attributes and the movement context for detecting rare behaviors through preprocessing, kNN-based clustering, and verification. Although the scheme involves several parameters, we demonstrate that they are able to be tackled in thresholds. As a result, a rare behavior factor is the single parameter that affect the detecting results. The proposed scheme is evaluated via a simulated data set for performance and a real life AIS data for effectiveness. Results show that high accuracy to labelled anomalies and useful rare behaviors can be achieved.","Rare behaviour detection,Trajectory,Visual analytics,"

"an efficient multi-sensor fusion approach for object detection in maritime environments","2018","Robust real-time object detection and tracking are challenging problems in autonomous transportation systems due to operation of algorithms in inherently uncertain and dynamic environments and rapid movement of objects. Therefore, tracking and detection algorithms must cooperate with each other to achieve smooth tracking of detected objects that later can be used by the navigation system. In this paper, we first present an efficient multi-sensor fusion approach based on the probabilistic data association method in order to achieve accurate object detection and tracking results. The proposed approach fuses the detection results obtained independently from four main sensors: radar, LiDAR, RGB camera and infrared camera. It generates object region proposals based on the fused detection result. Then, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) approach is used to identify the object categories within these regions. The CNN is trained on a real dataset from different ferry driving scenarios. The experimental results of tracking and classification on real datasets show that the proposed approach provides reliable object detection and classification results in maritime environments.","detection algorithms,sensor fusion,object categories,reliable object detection,fused detection result,Convolutional Neural Network approach,Cameras,Feature extraction,robust real-time object detection,accurate object detection,multi-sensor fusion,neural nets,dynamic environments,object tracking,navigation system,object detection,Proposals,maritime environments,Radar,convolutional neural networks,object region proposals,Sensor fusion,maritime environment,probabilistic data association method,probability,autonomous transportation systems,Object detection,smooth tracking,region proposals,efficient multisensor fusion approach,autonomous vessel,"

Firstly, we employ a vessel detection network to get the relative positions of the vessels from the calibrated camera-based data. Meanwhile, we design a series of filters based on data completeness, detection range, and vessel course to exclude the invalid AIS data.

"retrieving the stand age from a retrospective detection of multinannual forest changes using landsat data. application on the heavily managed maritime pine forest in southwestern france from a 30-year landsat time-series (1984â€“2014)","2015","The availability of Landsat data (Landsat 4, 5, 7 and 8) from ~30 years makes it possible to analyze the forest long term dynamics at high resolution (30m). The performances of the Landsat time-series have been already demonstrated for mapping and monitoring the annual clear-cuts and the storm damage in the Landes Forest, that covers ~1 million ha in southwestern France and that is heavily managed with even-aged stands with rather short rotations after clear-cut harvesting. Our objectives aimed at improving, automating, and enriching these previous methods. This was to operationally produce over the whole Landes Forest not only (1) the annual maps of clear-cutting from 1984 up the current year but also (2) the map of the current age that was derived from the forest change detected every year since 1984.

"infrared small maritime target detection based on integrated target saliency measure","2021","Robust and effective detection of a small target in an infrared maritime image is a key technology of maritime target search and tracking applications. Infrared small target detection is a challenging task due to the factors such as dim small targets and various complex backgrounds caused by sun glitters and strong waves. In this article, the integrated target saliency measure (ITSM) based on local and nonlocal spatial information is proposed to improve target detection performance. We combine local heterogeneity property of targets and nonlocal self-correlation property of background with targets' sparsity to separate real targets from background clutters. First, local heterogeneity calculation based on cross-window standard deviation (CSD) is proposed to extract candidate targets preliminarily, which enhances the local intensity difference between small targets and neighboring background. Meanwhile, low-rank representation (LRR) is applied to background prediction and removal, which is followed by adaptive threshold segmentation to enhance target saliency. Finally, we integrate the results obtained from the two steps mentioned above to further enhance targets and suppress background clutters. Then, real targets are extracted by an iterative threshold on the integrated map so as to generate the seed map, in addition, the target expansion strategy is exploited to keep full target areas. Experimental results on six datasets show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of robustness and target detection accuracy.","CSD,target detection,cross-window standard deviation,LRR,Feature extraction,Infrared maritime image,infrared maritime image,background clutter suppression,low-rank representation (LRR),low-rank representation,Standards,marine engineering,maritime target search,integrated target saliency measure,object detection,local heterogeneity property,Sparse matrices,small target detection,infrared small maritime target detection,Large Hadron Collider,correlation methods,infrared imaging,local heterogeneity,integrated saliency,Clutter,Object detection,background prediction,Task analysis,image segmentation,nonlocal spatial information,"
"vessel detection in video with dynamic maritime background","2012","Automating the detection of non-cooperative vessels in surveillance video is challenging. First, the detection algorithm has to handle a large degree of appearance variation of vessels with respect to shape, size and viewing geometry. Second, a unique challenge in the maritime domain is the presence of sea clutter, which can cause a high number of false detections. While recent research in object detection has largely been focused on objects on the ground, we have developed a layered detection algorithm to address challenges in the maritime domain by fusing cues from (1) a discriminative detection algorithm that learns a vessel target model from hundreds of vessel images, and (2) a dynamic texture-based background model that adaptively learns the spatiotemporal dynamics of sea clutter. We present results on how each layer of the algorithms was individually optimized, and how their outputs were fused.

"exploiting doppler in bernoulli track-before-detect for a scanning maritime radar","2022","Detection and tracking of small targets in sea clutter using high-resolution radar is a challenging problem. Recently, a Bernoulli track-before-detect (TBD) filter has been developed for an airborne scanning radar in the maritime domain, with the purpose of detection and tracking of short-exposure targets by using a fast scanning mode (i.e., short dwell-time and noncoherent integration). This article investigates the potential benefits of coherent radar processing and exploitation of Doppler information in TBD, when the radar operates in a slower scanning mode (i.e., using longer dwell times). For this purpose, a new Bernoulli TBD filter is developed, which is capable of processing full three-dimensional (range-azimuth-Doppler) radar data.

"spaceborne multichannel sar imaging algorithm for maritime moving targets","2023","Spaceborne multichannel synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is an effective means to realize high-resolution and wide-swath imaging. However, for spaceborne multichannel SAR imaging of maritime moving targets, the target motion will cause undesired channel imbalance, i.e., phase error, and further introduce the spurious targets in the image. To solve this problem, this article proposes a novel spaceborne multichannel SAR imaging algorithm for maritime moving targets, which consists of sequential coarse imaging and accurate imaging. The key strategies are to separate different moving targets by coarse imaging and to estimate the phase error based on the relationship between phase errors and amplitudes of spurious targets. First, the quantitative relationship between phase errors and amplitudes of spurious targets is established. Second, based on coarse imaging results, different maritime targets are effectively separated. Then, based on the measured amplitudes of spurious targets, a cost function, which represents the difference between the real target velocity and estimated target velocity, is constructed and minimized to separately estimate the velocities and phase errors of targets. Moreover, to further improve the accuracy of estimation and to suppress the undesired effects caused by target defocusing, clutter, and noise, an iterative strategy is adopted. Finally, by autofocusing, a well-focused SAR image is obtained. The GF-3 dual-channel real data experiment is conducted. The results indicate that the spurious targets are well suppressed, which validates the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.","estimation accuracy improvement,well-focused SAR image,undesired channel imbalance,spectrum reconstruction,radar detection,autofocusing,accurate imaging,real target velocity,Synthetic aperture radar,high-resolution imaging,moving target imaging,iterative strategy,spaceborne multichannel synthetic aperture radar,cost function,estimated target velocity,object detection,nonuniform sampling,synthetic aperture radar,spurious targets,radar imaging,velocity measurement,Radar polarimetry,sequential coarse imaging,Channel imbalance estimation,iterative methods,target defocusing,phase error estimation,Azimuth,target motion,GF-3 dual-channel real data experiment,spaceborne multichannel SAR imaging algorithm,spaceborne radar,Imaging,Signal to noise ratio,wide-swath imaging,parameter estimation,Estimation,multichannel synthetic aperture radar (SAR),Channel estimation,maritime moving targets,"

"the nitrate radical: physics, chemistry, and the atmosphere","1991","This review surveys the present state of knowledge of the nitrate (NO3 radical. Laboratory data on the physics and chemistry of the radical and atmospheric determination of the concentrations of the radical are both considered. One aim of the review is to highlight the relationship between the laboratory and the atmospheric studies. Although the emphasis of the review is on gas-phase processes, relevant studies conducted in condensed phases are mentioned because of their potential importance in the interpretation of cloud and aerosol chemistry. The spectroscopy, structure, and photochemistry of the radical are examined. Here, the object is to establich the spectroscopic basis for detection of the radical and measurement of its concentration in the laboratory and in the atmosphere. Infrared, visible, and paramagnetic resonance spectra are considered. An important quantity discussed is the absorption cross section in the visible region, which is required for quantitative measurements. Interpretation of the spectroscopic features requires an understanding of the geometrical and electronic structure of the radical in its ground and excited states; there is still some controversy about the groundstate geometry, but the most recent experimental evidence 9eg from laser induced fluorescence) and theoretical calculations suggest that the radical has D3h symmetry. Photodissociation of the radical is important in the atmosphere, and the product channels, quantum yields, and dissociation dynamics are discussed. A short examination of the thermodynamics (heat and entropy of formation) of the radical is presented. The main exposition of laboratory studies of the chemistry of the nitrate radical is preceded by a consideration of the techniques used for kinetic and mechanistic studies. Methods for the generation and detection of the radical and the kinetic tools employed are all presented. The exact nature of the technique used in individual studies has some relevance to the way in which data must be analysed, and to the type of mechanistic information that can be extracted. Continuous and stopped flow, flash photolysis and pulse radiolysis, molecular modulation, and static reactor techniques can all provide absolute kinetic data, while relative rate measurements have been a further rich source of information. The treatment of the chemical reactions of the nitrate radical is formally divided into the interactions with non-radical inorganic (deemed to include NO and NO2) and organic species, and with atoms and free radicals. In general, the reactions with open-shell species are much more rapid than those with closed-shell reactants. With the closed-shell partners, addition reactions are faster than abstraction reactions. An attempt is made to consider critically the published data on most reactions of importance, and to tabulate rate constants and temperature dependences where possible. However, it is not the objective of this review to provide recommendations for rate parameters. Evidence for the products of the reactions is sought, and for the branching ratios into the various channels where more than one exists. One theme of this part of the review is the elucidation of correlations of reactivity with structure and with the reactions of other radical species such as OH. The review turns next to a consideration of the role of NO3 in the atmosphere, of its atmospheric sources and sinks, and of field measurements of concentrations of the radical. Long-path visible-absorption spectroscopy and matrix-isolation ESR have both been used successfully in field measurements in the troposphere as well as the stratosphere. Balloon-borne instruments and ground-based remote sensing have been used to obtain stratospheric concentrations. Two of the most important implications of the measurements are that the stratospheric profiles are consistent with accepted chemistry (and, in particular, do not require the postulation of an unidentified scavenging mechanism that had, at one stage, been proposed), and that the highly variable night-time tropospheric concentrations imply that NO3 is a reactive tropospheric constituent. The inter-relation between laboratory studies and atmospheric observations, and the problems in extrapolating laboratory data to atmospheric conditions, are both explored. Initiation of night-time chemical transformations by NO3 and the possible production of OH are considered. The available information is then brought together to see how far NO3 is a sensitive indicator of the state of the atmosphere, and some speculations are presented about the involvement of NO3 (or N2O5) in damage to trees and plants. The final section of the review suggests some issues that remain unresolved concerning the NO3 radical which is directly or indirectly relevant to a better knowledge of the part played by the radical in the atmosphere. Amongst the requirements noted are improved data for the heat of formation of the radical, its absorption cross section in the visible region (and, especially, the temperature dependence of the cross section), and the details of its photochemistry. There is also still a need for a definitive determination of the equilibrium constant and its temperature dependence for the association with NO2 and the reverse dissociation of N2O5. A series of chemical reactions deserves further investigation, especially with regard to elucidation of product channels, and overall oxidation mechanisms also need to be defined better. Future atmospheric studies that are desirable include study of basic NO3 chemistry in the field to understand the influence of humidity on the conversion (probably on surfaces) of N2O5 to HNO3, and thus on NO3 concentrations. In addition, a study of the chemistry of NO3 in the presence of volatile organic compounds and at elevated concentrations of the oxides of nitrogen should help in the understanding of, for example, polluted marine coasts, forests, and urban areas.",""

"dynamic selection scheme of lte-m and 5g for efficient maritime communication based on traffic volume","2023","This paper investigates the technology for selecting communication scheme based on the amount of traffic in LTE-M (Marine) and 5G communication environments. Recently, it has been possible to use LTE-M and 5G communications for preventing collisions between ships and obstacles in coastal areas, moving from a focus on terrestrial users. This paper proposes a scheme for efficiently handling both small-scale and large-volume traffic generated from terminals on ships. LTE-M can accommodate more terminals by utilizing the wide coverage of coastal areas, but it can be vulnerable to high-volume video processing for real-time obstacle detection. 5G provides a high data transmission rate and low latency, making it suitable for large data exchanges between ships or real-time services, but its short coverage makes it unsuitable for accommodating a wide area. Therefore, this paper proposes a scheme for dynamically selecting LTE-M or 5G communication schemes according to the amount of data generated by terminals on ships, to transmit data. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to decide which communication scheme, LTE-M or 5G, should be chosen based on the amount and type of traffic. The algorithm dynamically selects the optimal communication scheme considering real-time traffic information and network status. By implementing a simulation environment for coastal areas using the technique proposed in this paper, we compare the scheme where terminals installed on ships selectively use LTE-M and 5G communication schemes with the scheme where two communication schemes are chosen randomly for transmission. The simulation results confirm that the proposed technique can process more data compared to the existing schemes.","Streaming media,Sea measurements,5G Communication Technology,Multi-Sensor Based Systems,5G mobile communication,Base stations,Heuristic algorithms,Fire Detection and Evacuation,Telecommunication traffic,System performance,"

For instance, deriving mission planning tools with multiple stakeholders and achieving coverage with a wide choice of platforms (coastal, airborne and satellite) are just some of the problems. In addition, it could be required to correlate results with intelligence data and to integrate radar systems with the automatic identification system (AIS) and vessel traffic services (VTS). Other issues could be providing navigational risk detection to support operators, as well as improving resource allocation for greater efficiency and cost savings. Having access to other services, such as weather and environment information, could be precious for route planning.

In order to support the operator while monitoring such systems, the identification of anomalous vessels or situations that might need further investigation may reduce the operator's cognitive load. While it is worth acknowledging that many existing mining applications support identification of anomalous behavior, autonomous anomaly detection systems are rarely used in the real world, since the detection of anomalous behavior is normally not a well-defined problem and therefore, human expert knowledge is needed. This calls for the development of interaction components that can support the user in the detection process.

"multifrequency rf-measurements and characterisation of propagation conditions in the maritime boundary layer","2016","In the maritime boundary layer, air-sea interaction processes have an important impact on radar propagation. The radar range performance near the sea surface depends on meteorological and sea surface conditions. Strong gradients of humidity and temperature close to the air-water interface are most often the reason for propagation effects such as ducting. For ship borne radars the evaporation duct is the dominant propagation mechanism affecting the maximum detection range. Ducting can also increase sea clutter return within and beyond the geometric horizon. Duct characteristics (duct heights, duct structures, duct formation behavior, duct existence, duct vertical and horizontal variability) depend on climatic zones and regional peculiarities.

"extraction of maritime road networks from large-scale ais data","2019","Extracting road network information including lane boundaries, lane centerlines, junctions and their relationship from AIS data plays an important role in location based services, urban computing and intelligent transportation systems, etc. However, AIS data are large scale, high noisy, the density and quality are very uneven in different areas, extracting a whole, continuous and smooth maritime road network with rich information from such data is a challenging problem. To address these issues, this paper proposes an adaptive maritime road network extraction approach that can extract both lane boundaries and centerlines for a large sea area from AIS data. Based on a road network definition including nodes, segments and segment curves, the approach designs parallel grid merging and filtering algorithms to determine if a grided area is inside lane or not.

"detecting the red tide algal blooms from satellite ocean color observations in optically complex northeast-asia coastal waters","2006","Over the last few decades, the coastal regions throughout the world have experienced incidences of algal blooms, which are harmful or otherwise toxic because of their potential threat to humans as well as marine organisms, owing to accelerated eutrophication from human activities and certain oceanic processes. Previous studies have found that correct identification of these blooms remains a great challenge with the standard bio-optical algorithms applied to satellite ocean color data in optically complex coastal waters containing high concentrations of the interfered dissolved organic and particulate inorganic materials. Here a new method called the red tide index (RI) is presented which is capable of identifying potential areas of harmful algal blooms (HABs) from SeaWiFS ocean color measurements representing the typical Case-2 water environments off the Korean and Chinese coasts. The RI method employs the water-leaving radiances (Lw), collected from in-situ radiometric measurements of three SeaWiFS bands centered at 443 nm, 510 nm and 555 nm, to achieve derivation of indices that are then related to absorbing characteristics of harmful algae (i.e., Lw at 443 nm) from which a best fit with a cubic polynomial function with correlation coefficient of R2=0.91 is obtained providing indices of higher ranges for HABs and lower and slightly reduced ranges for turbid and non-bloom waters. Similar indices derived from the use of remote sensing reflectance (Rrs), normalized water-leaving radiance (nLw) and combination of both are found rather inadequate to characterize the variability of the encountered bloom. In order to quantify the HABs in terms of chlorophyll (Chl), an empirical relationship is established between the RI and in-situ Chl in surface waters from about 0.4–71 mg m−3, which yields a Red tide index Chlorophyll Algorithm (RCA) based on an exponential function with correlation coefficient R2=0.92. The established methods were extensively tested and compared with the performances of standard Ocean Chlorophyll 4 (OC4) algorithm and Local Chlorophyll Algorithm (LCA) using SeaWiFS images collected from typical red tide waters of Korean South Sea (KSS), East China Sea (ECS), Yellow Sea (YS) and Bohai Sea (BS) during 1999–2002. The standard spectral ratio algorithms, the OC4 and LCA, yielded large errors in Chl retrievals for coastal areas, besides providing false information about the encountered HABs in KSS, ECS, YS and BS waters. On the contrary, the RI coupled with the standard spectral ratios yielded comprehensive information about various ranges of algal blooms, while RCA Chl showing a good agreement with in-situ data led to enhanced understanding of the spatial and temporal variability of the recent HAB occurrences in high scattering and absorbing waters off the Korean and Chinese coasts.","Red tide Index,Satellite ocean color,OC4 bio-optical algorithm,Korea,HABs,Red tide index Chlorophyll Algorithm,SeaWiFS,"

"real-time multi-object tracking using adaptive filtering and filter banks for maritime applications","2021","This paper presents a novel approach to Multi-Object-Tracking (MOT), which solves the well-known problem of maritime surveillance. We use exteroceptive sensors, such as LiDAR, and Automatic Identification System (AIS), to measure the surroundingsâ€™ Vessels. These objects are associated using evidence theory. Afterward, the proposed algorithm tracks all the objects using a new concept: each object is tracked with a respective filter bank consisting of three Adaptive Extended Kalman Filters (AEKF) as subfilters. These have the same prediction model but different correction algorithms based on various measurement sources. The covariance noise matrices are adapted based on the current measurement quality. The filter banks can overcome drawbacks such as wrong and incomplete measurements, thus improving tracking performance.We have validated the algorithm in real-world scenarios in Rostock Harbor, Germany. The proposed algorithm can track all the objects within the view simultaneously in real-time. By comparing with a reference vessel, the mean 2D position error is ca. 2 m, which is much smaller than the AIS-only solution (5 to 10 m). During the test drive, the filter bank can detect and compensate for incorrect information, such as biased AIS positioning or incomplete LiDAR measurements, to guarantee robust positioning.","covariance matrices,Kalman filters,measurement sources,signal denoising,Prediction algorithms,channel bank filters,respective filter bank,Laser radar,time multiobject tracking,Adaptive Extended Kalman Filters,MultiObject-Tracking,Filter banks,object tracking,Evidence theory,Automatic Identification System,filtering theory,maritime surveillance,Weight measurement,nonlinear filters,maritime applications,Real-time systems,adaptive filtering,size 5.0 m to 10.0 m,wrong measurements,different correction algorithms,tracking performance,Current measurement,geophysical signal processing,current measurement quality,incomplete measurements,size 2.0 m,adaptive filters,oceanographic techniques,"

As ship targets can be characterized by complex motions, they usually appear defocused in level-1 SAR images. Previous works have shown the effectiveness of the applications of Inverse SAR (ISAR) techniques to refocus the images of such targets. Apart from achieving well-focused images, also the knowledge of ship velocity is strategic information for surveillance. Therefore, in this work, we analyze the capability of ISAR techniques to estimate the ship translational motion: to this purpose, two different autofocus approaches are considered and compared, one based on the image contrast and the other on the phase gradient algorithm.

Every change of this condition needs to be detected and classified automatically and in real-time. To ensure this, it is necessary to have more than just a camera capturing visible light, so a thermal infrared capturing camera and a hyperspectral sensor are also used.

Extensive field tests are often required to test an entire radar system. This is not only expensive, but also requires a great deal of time. To reduce test complexity and cost, simulation techniques are used to recreate real-world conditions in a laboratory environment. Many subsystems can be tested by radar target generators simulating radar echo signals. They usually consider Swerling models, but struggle to simulate clutter, or in particular sea clutter.

"detection and geovisualization of abnormal vessel behavior from video","2021","Intelligent maritime situational awareness pursues an effective understanding of the majority of the activities related to the maritime domain (impacting the safety, security, economy, or environment), with the aid of artificial intelligence systems.

Although much progress has been made in anomaly detection and visualization using vessel self-reporting positioning data, there have been no corresponding advances using video data, despite the increasing use of cameras for maritime surveillance. In this work, we introduce a framework which goes beyond vessel tracking for anomaly detection in video, and is therefore applicable to scenes with a high density of vessels. The proposed framework detects abnormal behavior using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and interprets this knowledge using metrics derived from clustering the positions and courses provided by an independent vessel/motion detector.

"fast detection of small targets in high-resolution maritime radars by feature normalization and fusion","2022","Joint exploitation of multiple features is a recognized way to implement the effective detection of small targets on the sea in high-resolution maritime radars at the dwelling mode. The tri-feature-based and feature-compression-based detectors use the time-consuming convex hull learning and decision. In this article, a fast feature-fusion-based detector using seven salient features is proposed, where the convex hull learning and decision are replaced by simple threshold determination and decision. It is found that the seven features of sea clutter can be modeled well by the Burr type XII and t-distributions. From the fitted distribution, each feature is normalized to approximate the standard Gaussian distribution by a nonlinear transformation. In the seven-dimensional normalized feature space, an analytical method is given to calculate the optimal weights of feature fusion by the maximization of the interclass distance of the two-class samples. Owing to the normalization of the seven features, the feature fusion loss is significantly reduced comparing with the direct fusion of seven features. The fast feature-fusion-based detector was evaluated on the open and recognized radar databases and offshore experimental data using an unmanned aerial vehicle with a corner reflector. The results show that the fast detector attains competitive performance with the existing best feature-based detector.","nonlinear transformation,t-distributions,small targets on the sea,statistical distributions,sensor fusion,marine radar,corner reflector,feature fusion loss,radar detection,radar clutter,seven features,small targets,Feature extraction,sea clutter,fast detector attains competitive performance,time-consuming convex hull learning,recognized radar databases,standard Gaussian distribution,unmanned aerial vehicle,offshore experimental data,Fast feature-fusion-based detector,Databases,object detection,feature extraction,high-resolution maritime radars,tri-feature-based detectors,Radar,autonomous aerial vehicles,Burr type XII,simple threshold determination,Training,fast detection,feature normalization,seven salient features,feature-compression-based detectors,Clutter,radar resolution,fast feature-fusion-based detector,Gaussian distribution,seven-dimensional normalized feature space,normalized feature space,Detectors,Radar detection,"

"mode-selective othr: a new cost-effective sensor for maritime domain awareness","2010","This paper presents a new sensor concept designed to provide maritime domain awareness over large ocean areas. The Mode-Selective OTHR introduced herein achieves significant detection and tracking capability against maritime vessels relative to traditional OTHR designs because it is designed specifically to reject disturbed ionospheric propagation modes and operate only using low distortion propagation modes.

"remote sensing satellite technology to determine the center of the maritime defense logistics route for securing the indonesian capital city (ikn)","2022","Displacement of the capital of Indonesia has been provided for in Law Number 3 of 2022, namely the IKN Nusantara which is one of the centers of gravity or the center of national strategic strength so that security for the area is very much needed. In order to secure the IKN from all possible enemy attacks, a military defense base is needed that functions as a Logistics support center to support all military operations. The purpose of this study is to determine a strategic location as a center for maritime defense logistics distribution lines in order to secure the IKN area using the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) method combined with satellite image analysis using a Geographic Information System (GIS) by considering the criteria and sub-criteria in determining the location center for maritime defense logistics distribution lines.

"maritime environment perception based on deep learning","2022","Environment perception is an essential aspect of automated maritime vehicles, especially in high-traffic areas. In recent years, deep-learning-based object detection using LiDAR has been well developed in the automotive sector but has not yet seen a similar level of sophisticated development in maritime applications. In these applications, LiDAR detection should be fused with other maritime navigation systems such as the automatic identification system (AIS) to expand the detection range. To address this, we propose a novel deep-learning-based concept for maritime environment perception by using LiDAR as a primary sensor and AIS as an assisting information source. This approach consists of three functional modules: object detection, multi-object tracking, and static environment mapping. For object detection, we apply a convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect floating objects represented as oriented bounding boxes. To train the CNN, we propose a method that generates simulated labeled datasets. The detected objects from CNN are tracked with Kalman Filter banks. The remaining LiDAR data points are treated as static environments and represented by polygons. We evaluated the approach by using simulative and real-world datasets. In the simulation, the average precision of the CNN object detector reaches 60.8%, with a data processing rate of 40 Hz in GPU. Our real-world evaluations show that this approach can track 83% of the vessels in a crowded harbor, with the overall intersection over union reaching 64%. Our proposed approach represents the first application of CNN for LiDAR-based maritime environment perception, demonstrating its high potential for future online and real-world applications.","high-traffic areas,real-world applications,static environment mapping,Kalman filters,CNN object detector,automated maritime vehicles,deep-learning-based concept,static environments,Laser radar,neural nets,frequency 40.0 Hz,deep learning,object tracking,automatic identification system,LiDAR detection,Intelligent vessels,supervised learning,maritime navigation,AIS,object detection,sophisticated development,image classification,Radar tracking,Artificial intelligence,convolutional neural network,optical radar,Point cloud compression,Radar,maritime applications,maritime navigation systems,detection range,LiDAR-based maritime environment perception,multi-object tracking,Object detection,deep-learning-based object detection,multiobject tracking,learning (artificial intelligence),remaining LiDAR data points,Detectors,"
"heterogeneous twin dehazing network for visibility enhancement in maritime video surveillance","2021","Visible images captured by maritime video surveillance system under hazy environment often suffer from low contrast and information loss, etc. These negative factors will significantly limit the development and progression of target recognition, detection, tracking, and other vision-based technologies in maritime applications. However, existing dehazing methods are mainly designed for massive inland images, resulting in inaccurate estimation of haze-free versions under the maritime scene. In this work, we propose a heterogeneous twin dehazing network (termed HTDNet) for enhancing visually-degraded maritime images. The HTDNet is mainly composed of two modules, i.e., twin feature extraction module (T-FEM) and feature fusion module (FFM). In particular, T-FEM is employed to collect coarse haze features from two views, and FFM is designed for feature integration and enhancement. To further improve the visual quality, the dataset containing massive maritime images is constructed to train our network. Both synthetic and real-world experiments have illustrated our superior performance compared with several state-of-the-art methods. There is thus a great potential to successfully extend our HTDNet to enable maritime intelligent transportation system.","T-FEM,massive inland images,HTDNet,massive maritime images,Conferences,data visualisation,Feature extraction,maritime intelligent transportation system,image enhancement,maritime video surveillance system,feature extraction module,visibility enhancement,target tracking,Target recognition,image fusion,fusion module,FFM,marine engineering,Target tracking,object detection,feature extraction,twin feature extraction module,Video surveillance,video signal processing,feature integration,coarse haze features,Visualization,feature fusion module,video surveillance,vision-based technologies,visual quality,target recognition,Estimation,heterogeneous twin dehazing network,visible images captured,hazy environment,"

"computationally effective range migration compensation in pcl systems for maritime surveillance","2018","In this paper, we consider the possibility of extending the coherent processing interval (CPI) as a way to improve target detection capability in passive radars for maritime surveillance applications. Despite the low velocity of the considered targets, range walk effects could limit the performance of the system when long CPIs are considered. To overcome these limitations while keeping the computational load controlled, we resort to a sub-optimal implementation of the Keystone Transform (KT), based on Lagrange polynomial interpolation, recently presented by the authors and successfully applied against aerial targets. Following those promising results, we extend the proposed approach to a coastal surveillance scenario. In the considered case, since longer CPI values are used, the proposed strategy appears to be even more attractive with respect to a conventional KT implementation based on the Chirp-Z Transform interpolation. In fact, comparable detection performance are obtained with a remarkable computational load saving.

Lightning strokes measured by a lightning detection network, human thunderstorm observations at weather stations and convective cells derived from radar reflectivity are used. The analysis reveals conditions favourable for thunderstorm development and highlights regions affected under different flow regimes. Additionally, the cell-based analysis shows that different synoptic conditions are typically associated with specific cell characteristics, such as the direction and speed of movement or cell sizes and severity. These relationships can be explained meaningfully via a description of the synoptic-meteorological characteristics of each of the standard weather patterns. As such these results may support a better understanding of thunderstorm formation as well as improve forecasters' situational awareness.","Climatology,Thunderstorm,Automatic classification,Synoptic conditions,"

The driving force behind this research is the need for surveillance and safety, particularly within harbours, where many maritime incidents and accidents occur. The research work developed here identifies and tracks maritime vessels moving within the narrow confines of a harbour entrance. Using a number of consecutive image frames, a hierarchical statistical motion pyramid is constructed, this is used to extract motion at different levels within each image. To identify and track the vessels as they move in the image a high-level reasoning process is used. This process associates the extracted motion dynamics at the different levels within the pyramid with the vessels concerned.

"concurrent use of satellite imaging and passive acoustics for maritime domain awareness","2010","The research being conducted in the Center for Secure and Resilient Maritime Commerce (CSR), a DHS National Center of Excellence for Port Security examines some basic science issues and emerging technologies to improve the security of ports and inland waterways, as well as coastal and offshore operations. This research follows a layered approach utilizing above water and underwater surveillance techniques. The investigated layers include satellite-based wide area surveillance; HF Radar systems providing over-the-horizon monitoring; and nearshore and harbor passive acoustic surveillance. Integration of these systems is aimed at achieving vessel detection, classification, identification, and tracking. In this paper, we present the results of sea tests where satellite imagery was combined with concurrent passive acoustic surveillance. The wide area sensing was provided by the University of Miami CSTARS facility's electro-optical (EO) and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite imaging capabilities. Satellites detected the ships using a panchromatic EO sensor FormoSat-2 and SAR from the COSMO-SkyMed constellation. The Stevens Passive Acoustic System was used for detecting sound produced by the same ships that were detected by satellites. Concurrent Satellite - Acoustic measurements provide the following advantages: 1. Increasing the probability of small vessel detection and decreasing false alarms. 2. The joint systems can provide redundant detection and classification in conditions where one of the systems fails. For example, EO satellite imaging does not work at night and in fog and cloudy conditions while acoustic detection has limits during stormy weather due to ambient noise. SAR imaging can detect vessels in all weather, but provides less detail about a specific vessel. 3. Acoustics can provide target classification and bearing and satellites can give target localization and heading. SAR data can be used to estimate vessel speed in some cases. 4. Satellite imaging is helpful for the acoustic detection of an underwater target in cases when satellite information allows separation of surface and underwater targets. 5. Joint measurements provide more data (information) for target classification. Several tests were conducted in New York Harbor, where the satellite images and acoustic signatures of the same boats were recorded. The satellite registered a number of small boats.

"energy-efficient task offloading of edge-aided maritime uav systems","2023","This paper considers the autonomous detecting and tracking task of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in the maritime environment. Due to the high computational complexity of the image-processing task, the strict latency requirement of the tracking task, and the shortage of batteries and computational capability of UAVs, the UAVs can offload the computing-intensive task to the edge computing server (ECS) to reduce the task latency and energy consumption. Even though, the large latency and energy consumption brought by some high-definition image-processing task still make some visual tracking difficult to perform. We first investigate the impact of video frame resolution on computing task size and detection accuracy, and further on task latency and energy consumption. In addition, we optimize the transmission power, the local CPU frequency, the offloading rate of UAVs, and the bandwidth allocation between UAVs. We model the UAVs tracking system as an energy consumption optimization problem with the constraint of task latency. Although the proposed optimization problem is complex, we transform the optimization problem into several subproblems with decoupling and rigorous mathematical proof. By combining the convex optimization with the genetic algorithm, an offloading algorithm with low complexity and good performance is obtained, which is verified by comparing with some benchmark offloading strategies in the numerical results.","unmanned aerial vehicles,Image edge detection,energy-efficient task offloading,remotely operated vehicles,image resolution,Energy consumption,convex programming,control engineering computing,bandwidth allocation,transmission power optimization,genetic algorithms,detection accuracy,edge computing server,genetic algorithm,Energy resolution,strict latency requirement,Target tracking,optimisation,edge computing,local CPU frequency,tracking task,UAV computational capability,visual tracking,high-definition image-processing task,mathematical proof,offload,visual target tracking,power aware computing,computing task size,edge-aided maritime UAV systems,autonomous aerial vehicles,Optimization,Edge computing,maritime environment,energy consumption,Image resolution,computational complexity,energy consumption optimization problem,Task analysis,computing-intensive task,ECS,UAV,"

However, maritime environment represents lots of challenges such as wave of water, boat movements, and weather condition. This paper presents a method for detecting moving boats from sequence of images. We reply on background subtraction (BS) techniques to detect main movements in the scene. However, as the BS algorithms detect only motion pixels, they cannot detect when boats stay immobile for a moment or move slightly. In addition, the BS results often suffer strongly from water waves as well as boat wake. To overcome these drawbacks we detect salient regions using saliency detection techniques (SD) on images. We then apply dynamic fusion technique on BS and SD results for a final boat detection.

"maritime ship target imaging with gnss-based passive multistatic radar","2023","In the field of maritime surveillance, the global navigation satellite system (GNSS)-based passive radar has proven its potential for moving target detection (MTD), localization, and velocity estimation. The next stage is to investigate the possibility of obtaining the radar image of the moving ship for target recognition. However, the limited signal power budget of GNSS prevents the conventional inverse synthetic aperture radar technique that is based on target rotational motion and short observation time for GNSS-based passive radar imaging moving target. In this article, a two-stage imaging processing method relying on the target translational motion over a long observation time is proposed. The first stage confirms the presence of the target by a long-time MTD processing technique. In the second stage, based on the analysis of the Doppler history of the target signal in the slow-time domain, short-time Fourier transform and modified random sample consensus are combined to robustly estimate target velocity with reduced computation complexity. To obtain the focused bistatic image, azimuth compression is conducted by using the estimated target velocity. Finally, an image fusion operation is implemented to combine the bistatic images achievable from multiple satellites so that a multistatic image with high quality can be created.

Two application scenarios in maritime environments are specifically considered: 1) collaborative search and tracking of targets and 2) circular formation flight for detection of external threats to ship convoys. Numerical simulations are presented, allowing to characterize the performance of the network. Preliminary flight test results using two ANTEX-X02 UAVs from the Portuguese Air Force (PoAF) are also included.","unmanned aerial vehicles,ANTEX-X02 UAV,Ad hoc networks,remotely operated vehicles,Marine vehicles,maritime scenarios,modular approach,video data rate,Target tracking,computational tool,maritime environments,maximum range,Collaboration,Telemetry,autonomous aerial vehicles,Unmanned aerial vehicles,communication range,simultaneous video transmissions,capacity limits,Tools,UAV network,"
"an overview of cawses-india program with emphasis to equatorial atmospheric coupling processes","2012","This paper presents an overview of CAWSES—India program, highlighting some of the Indian coordinated efforts to understand the Sun−Earth system as a whole, with special emphasis to the equatorial and low latitude phenomena. Two multi-institutional, multi-instrument campaigns, one under ‘Space Weather: Science and Applications’ and the other emphasizing tides under ‘Atmospheric Coupling Processes’ were conducted during February–April 2006. The highlights of the campaigns include improved prediction of equatorial spread-F (ESF) based on a ‘new factor’ combining the strength and asymmetry of the equatorial ionization anomaly (EIA); simultaneous detection of quasi-2-day wave at both E and F region heights; tomographic image showing a Traveling Ionospheric Disturbance (TID) in association with a counter electrojet (CEJ) event—all highlighting the neutral and electrodynamical coupling of the equatorial ionosphere−thermosphere regions; an unusual lowering of mesospheric temperature during a moderate geomagnetic storm—highlighting a new space weather effect; diurnal tide showing a peak amplitude of 35m/s at 45km in zonal wind and a significantly lower amplitude (∼15m/s) in the meridional wind and also evidence of convective activity in the lower atmosphere influencing the tidal variability in the Mesosphere−Lower Thermosphere (MLT) region highlighting the vertical coupling of the atmospheric regions. The development of models for equatorial and low latitude ionosphere has been among the prime activities taken up under ‘Space Climate’. Two models have been developed towards this end: one based on Second Degree (SD) relationships of F region parameters to the mean sun spot number and the other a Multiple Regression Analysis (MRA) based model involving expressions relating F region parameters to that representing solar and geomagnetic activities. The two models, intended for long and short term predictions, have been found to represent the equatorial and low latitude ionosphere over Indian longitudes better than the commonly used International Reference Ionosphere (IRI). Under the theme of ‘Solar Influence on Atmospheric Climate’, a study has been made on the effects of solar variability on middle atmosphere using satellite data and model simulations, highlighting the significant differences between them.","Ionosphere,Magnetosphere,CAWSES,Stratosphere–troposphere,Solarwind,Mesosphere,Thermosphere,"
"perturbation analysis for maritime applications","2012","Target detection of marine features is a major topic for the security and monitoring of coastlines. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) has been shown to be particularly useful because of its all-weather and night capability. In this paper a methodology based on the perturbation analysis developed by the authors is presented. The latter can be applied for detection of ships (non-marine targets) or classification of sea ice. The algorithm can be considered to be a negative filter focused on sea. Consequently, all the features which have a polarimetric behaviour different from the sea are detected and considered as targets. A complete validation with RADARSAT-2 full polarimetric data was performed in Portsmouth, UK. An accurate ground truth carried out during the acquisition, was accompanied, considering AIS GPS location and photographic evidences. Moreover, a map of the buoys helped locating this typology of targets. The results showed impressive accuracy, with detection of all the vessels seen during the ground truth.","Clutter,Classification algorithms,Vectors,Scattering,Marine vehicles,Detectors,Feature extraction,"

"deep learning aided beam vector assignment for massive mimo maritime communication considering location information and handover impact","2022","Location aided beamforming (LAB) has been proposed as a potential solution to fast beam vector (BV) selection for massive multi-input multi-output (M-MIMO) maritime communication systems. However, the existing LAB schemes hardly consider the impact from handover. In this paper, we propose to apply the Gaussian anomaly detection (GAD) to improve the system performance, particularly in the handover zone, by exploiting the information of sea lane and locations of the user equipment (UE). Furthermore, inspired by the rationale of deep learning (DL) aided image processing methods, we first transform the BV assignment problem to a location-based artificial gray value classification problem, and then utilize a convolutional deep belief networks (CDBN) to predict the BV indices from a predefined codebook constituted by location-related feature matrices. In addition, we exploit GAD to rectify the training data of CDBN, such that the prediction on BV assignments can be more accurate to achieve a higher capacity than known methods. Finally, an extensive comparison with selected existing schemes through simulations demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.","Convolutional deep belief network (CDBN),Maritime communication,Deep learning (DL),Massive multiple input multiple output (M-MIMO),Gaussian anomaly detection (GAD),"

"designing intelligent coastal surveillance based on big maritime data","2020","The ocean is classified into several territorial regimes that span from internal waters, archipelagic waters, territorial seas, contiguous zones, exclusive economic zones (EEZ), and high seas. The relevant state authorities must perform surveillance of all ships that navigate through their respective territories to ensure the ship safety and prevent them from carrying out illegal activities such as illegal unregulated and unreported (IUU) fishing, illegal firearms smuggling, and piracy. Currently, maritime domain surveillance is carried out using a combination of Automatic Identification System (AIS), Coastal Radar System (CRS), and Long Range Camera (LRC). The massive amount of incoming data from these surveillance systems produce big maritime data. However, big maritime data is useless without artificial intelligence intervention. This research proposed an intelligent system that provides and analyzes ship path planning, identifies suspicious ships, track ships, and approaches and attacks target ships using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm.

"unmanned aerial vehicle landing on maritime vessels using signal prediction of the ship motion","2018","Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are becoming more prevalent in maritime operations. For safe operation, one of the key challenges of using UAVs at sea is the relative motion that exists between the UAV and ship. For perpetual maritime operations, UAV systems need to be able to land safely on ocean vessels. Determining a `quiescent period', where the roll and pitch angles of the ship are below a danger threshold, is a challenging problem for UAV systems. In general, current strategies rely on reactive systems and often use sensors on board the maritime vessel. The scope of the current paper is a proof-of-concept methodology which uses a signal prediction algorithm to facilitate safer autonomous UAV-ship landings. This study uses laser ranging and detecting devices (LIDAR) in conjunction with a signal prediction algorithm (SPA) to forecast when the ship motion is within safe landing limits. ShipMo3D was used to generate twelve trial cases for UAV-ship landings on a 33 m ship. The results show that with the use of the SPA, the number of UAV landing attempts was decreased by an average of 2 attempts, per test case, when compared to a system that did not use an SPA. Moreover, the results indicate that with revised tuning of the SPA, the likelihood of a safe landing can be further improved.","maritime vessel,ShipMo3D,Prediction algorithms,Marine vehicles,Mathematical model,laser ranging,ship motion,Laser radar,laser ranging and detecting devices,unmanned aerial vehicle landing,ships,aircraft landing guidance,optical radar,autonomous UAV-ship landings,autonomous aerial vehicles,Tracking,ocean vessels,Unmanned aerial vehicles,LIDAR,perpetual maritime operations,signal prediction algorithm,SPA,Brushless motors,"
"ship speed power performance under relative wind profiles in relation to sensor fault detection","2018","Statistical data analysis and visualization approaches to identify ship speed power performance under relative wind (i.e. apparent wind) profiles are considered in this study. Ship performance and navigation data of a selected vessel are analyzed, where various data anomalies, i.e. sensor related erroneous data conditions, are identified. Those erroneous data conditions are investigated and several approaches to isolate such situations are also presented by considering appropriate data visualization methods. Then, the cleaned data are used to derive various relationships among ship performance and navigation parameters that have been visualized in this study, appropriately. The results show that the wind profiles along ship routes can be used to evaluate vessel performance and navigation conditions by assuming the respective sea states relate to their wind conditions. Hence, the results are useful to derive appropriate mathematical models that represent ship performance and navigation conditions. Such mathematical models can be used for weather routing type applications (i.e. voyage planning), where the respective weather forecast can be used to derive optimal ship routes to improve vessel performance and reduce fuel consumption. This study presents not only an overview of statistical data analysis of ship performance and navigation data but also the respective challenges in data anomalies (i.e. erroneous data intervals and sensor faults) due to onboard sensors and data handling systems. Furthermore, the respective solutions to such challenges in data quality have also been presented by considering data visualization approaches.","Speed power performance,Data anomaly detection,Sensor fault identification,Weather routing,Ship wind profile,Statistical data analysis,"
"deep learning to enhance maritime situation awareness","2019","Maritime surveillance sensors like AIS (Automatic Identification System) and Radar provide useful information for decision-making support, which is of paramount importance for effective operations against maritime threats and illegal activities [1]. However, decision-making systems that trust solely on AIS information tend to fail in real situations because such information could be missing, inaccurate or even deceptive [2]. On the other hand, only Radar information is not enough to get a complete description of the maritime situational picture. This paper proposes a deep learning framework for vessel monitoring that examines a particular scenario where a deep learning solution can infer a navigation status based on the vessels trajectories, and thus to detect suspicious vessels activities. For this purpose, a dataset, named DeepMarine, has been specifically created by collecting data of AIS historical recordings.

"beidou-based passive multistatic radar maritime moving target detection technique via spaceâ€“time hybrid integration processing","2022","This article puts forward a BeiDou-based passive multistatic radar (PMR) maritime moving target (MMT) detection technique via spaceâ€“time hybrid integration (STHI) processing. Compared with passive bistatic radar (PBR), the utilization of multiple satellites provides an improvement in MMT detection performance, together with the capabilities of localization and velocity estimation. However, the multiple satellite transmitters cause the differences principally in bistatic range and Doppler centroid (DC) of the MMT. To integrate the PMR echoes, the biggest challenge is the two differences that need to be handled. In the proposed technique, first, the centroid-compensated keystone transform (CCKT) is proposed and applied to each PBR echo. It not only corrects range cell migration (RCM) but also equalizes the DC to the same. Then, the long-time integration is performed on each PBR echo, after which it is integrated into the range-Doppler frequency rate (DFR) domain. Finally, in order to settle the difference in bistatic range, an MMT position and velocity domain (i.e., the  $X$ â€“ $Y$ â€“ $V$  domain) is constituted. The obtained multiple range-DFR maps are projected to the  $X$ â€“ $Y$ â€“ $V$  domain, and then, the effective integration of multistatic echoes can be implemented. The final STHI result allows detecting the MMT reliably. Meanwhile, according to the 3-D position where the MMT is located in the  $X$ â€“ $Y$ â€“ $V$  domain, the MMT can be localized, and its velocity can be estimated simultaneously. In May 2021, we have successfully carried out the worldâ€™s first BeiDou-based PMR MMT detection experiment, and the experimental results are given to prove the effectiveness of this technique.","Satellites,MMT position,range cell migration,marine radar,MMT detection performance,radar detection,passive radar,PBR echo,RCM,transforms,passive bistatic radar,Radio transmitters,STHI processing,BeiDou-based PMR MMT detection technique,space-time hybrid integration processing,satellite navigation,centroid-compensated keystone transform,maritime surveillance,maritime moving target (MMT) detection,object detection,BeiDou-based passive radar,spaceâ€“time hybrid integration (STHI),PMR echoes,bistatic range,Doppler effect,multistatic echoes,Doppler centroid,Satellite broadcasting,range-Doppler frequency rate domain,multiple satellite transmitters,Doppler radar,Passive radar,BeiDou-based passive multistatic radar maritime moving target detection technique,Receivers,spaceborne radar,CCKT,Multistatic radar,passive multistatic radar (PMR),radar cross-sections,range-DFR domain,multiple range-DFR maps,"
"information fusion and tracking using bernoulli filters for maritime surveillance","2022","This paper concerns the application of information fusion and Bernoulli filtering to a maritime surveillance scenario. Sensor data was recorded during live trials featuring a static Leonardo Osprey maritime surveillance active electronic scan array (AESA) radar observing a cooperative rigid inflatable boat (RIB) target deployed in the Firth of Forth estuary north of Edinburgh, UK. The RIB was equipped with a global positioning system (GPS) and an automatic identification system (AIS) recording geodetic position over time, where the collected data is fused to generate ground truth. A multi-target joint detection and tracking (MTJDT) algorithm is used to both detect and track the RIB target from post-processed radar and AIS data whilst ignoring other information regarding objects and sources of interference. Generalised optimal sub-pattern assignment (GOSPA) and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis are used to evaluate target detection, localisation, and cardinality performance quantification. Results suggest conventional data processing and the proposed tracking algorithm achieve reasonable detection and tracking performance under the assumption that the ground truth well-represents the RIB position without knowledge of error statistics, but track divergence and discontinuities occur due to radar obscuration by buildings, data inaccuracies and clutter.","maritime surveillance scenario,sensor fusion,marine radar,reasonable detection,geodetic position,multitarget joint detection,target detection,Global Positioning System,information fusion,information regarding objects,target tracking,global positioning system,image fusion,sensor data,automatic identification system,data inaccuracies,filtering theory,boats,RIB target,static Leonardo Osprey maritime surveillance active electronic scan array radar,object detection,radar interference,video recording,radar imaging,radar receivers,bernoulli filters,conventional data processing,radar tracking,clutter,radar obscuration,post processed radar,rigid inflatable boat target,video surveillance,track divergence,RIB position,AIS data,"
"moving ship optimal association for maritime surveillance: fusing ais and sentinel-2 data","2022","Nowadays, a variety of different sources can be combined together to measure and monitor maritime human activities. Reliable data fusion techniques are essential to associate the targets from different systems for maritime surveillance. In particular, the fusion of data from Sentinel-2 satellites and the automatic identification system (AIS) has attracted wide attention due to their public availability and complementarity. However, most traditional methods for target association are not suitable for this particular case, due to the time lag phenomenon of Sentinel-2 data. In this study, we first construct two new datasets for the detection of moving ships and their wakes based on Sentinel-2 images. Combined with the detection results obtained by the you only look once (YOLOv5) model, the position and course information of the detected ships are first extracted. After carefully analyzing the time lag phenomenon of Sentinel-2 data, we develop a new domain adaptation-based method for target association based on the fusion of Sentinel-2 and AIS data, called moving ship optimal association (MSOA). Different from standard domain adaptation methods only for representation alignment, the proposed MSOA is able to align representation, time, and position simultaneously. A case study is provided in which the newly proposed method is tested over the Port of Long Beach, USA. Experimental results demonstrate that both moving ships and wakes are well detected. Specifically, our newly proposed MSOA exhibits more accurate and robust performance when compared to traditional methods, and the detected ships without corresponding AIS tracks can also be detected by our MSOA. Moreover, the real sensing time and time lag of Sentinel-2 data are deduced with high accuracy. Overall, it can be concluded that our MSOA provides a new perspective for accurate target association based on heterogeneous data fusion.","surveillance,Remote sensing,sensor fusion,remote sensing,MSOA,time lag,ship detection,detected ships,heterogeneous data fusion,Marine vehicles,domain adaptation,ship optimal association,Data fusion,accurate target association,geophysical image processing,Sentinel-2 images,target tracking,Optical sensors,ships,time lag phenomenon,maritime surveillance,Target tracking,target association,you only look once (YOLO),Artificial intelligence,radar tracking,moving ships,Sentinel-2 satellites,Sensors,Surveillance,maritime surveillance (MS),domain adaptation-based method,reliable data fusion techniques,AIS data,Sentinel-2 data,"
"a framework for maritime anti-collision pattern discovery from ais network","2019","The avoidance of collisions between ships in encounter situations is crucial to maritime traffic safety. Most research on maritime collision avoidance has focused on planning a safe path by which to avoid approaching ships in accordance with the requirements laid out in the International Regulations for Preventing Collision at Sea (COLREGs). The resulting solution provides reference for the navigator in planning movements to avoid collisions. Nonetheless, specific anti-collision actions are generally based on the experience of the navigator. This study differed from existing works in that we sought to derive collision avoidance behavior from the trajectory data of actual ships. The Automatic Identification System (AIS) network makes it possible to collect an enormous volume of trajectory data and investigate real-world ship behavior. Unfortunately trajectory data that introduces uncertainty can hinder behavior mining for collision avoidance. Irregular and/or asynchronous location sampling can lead to situations in which the movement of a ship does not necessarily follow a given trajectory, even if its movement behavior is similar to that of other ships. In this study, we developed a framework to decipher the anti-collision behavior of ships in encounter situations from a large database of trajectory data collected by AIS network, and to present this behavior in the form of anti-collision patterns. A prototype of the proposed framework was built to enable pattern analysis and visualization functions, thereby providing a deeper understanding of collision avoidance behavior in maritime traffic.

"comparison of target detectors to identify icebergs in quad- polarimetric sar alos-2 images","2021","Icebergs represent hazards to ships and maritime activities and therefore their detection is essential. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellites are very useful for this, due to their capability to acquire under cloud cover and during polar nights. Additionally, polarimetry has been proven to improve the detection capability. In this work, we compare six state-of-the-art quad polarimetric detectors to test their performance and ability to detect small sized icebergs in four locations in Greenland. These were the polarimetric notch filter (PNF), polarimetric match filter (PMF), polarimetric whitening filter (PWF), optimal polarimetric detector (OPD), reflection symmetry detector, and the dual polarisation anomaly detector (iDPolRAD). We use four single look complex ALOS-2 quad pol images. The data were calibrated and processed. We produce the covariance matrices of each image before applying a testing and training window for detection. We also add a guard window to reduce false alarms.

"unsupervised maritime vessel re-identification with multi-level contrastive learning","2023","Re-identification (re-ID) of maritime vessels plays an important role in marine surveillance, but remains highly unexplored due to the lack of large-scale annotated datasets. In vessel re-ID, contrastive methods are supposed to learn discriminative representation from unlabeled vessel images in an unsupervised manner. However, directly introducing classical instance-level contrastive methods to maritime vessel re-ID suffers from the difficulty of finding vessel images with the same pseudo label as positive images, which potentially leads to inefficient training and unsatisfactory performance. This paper proposes a simple but effective method to solve such a hard positive problem. Our method takes all images in an intra-batch cluster as positives and excludes them from the set of negative samples when computing instance-level contrastive loss. Based on this strategy, we construct a multi-level contrastive learning (MCL) framework for vessel re-ID trained with the specifically designed intra-batch cluster-level contrastive loss along with the instance-level one. Experiments on a newly proposed dataset consisting of 1,248 vessel identities show that MCL achieves the state-of-the-art performance compared with other unsupervised methods.","object recognition,discriminative representation,unsupervised learning,Cameras,Unsupervised learning,Vessel re-identification,instance-level contrastive loss,contrastive learning,intra-batch cluster-level contrastive loss,image representation,MCL,Intelligent transportation systems,unsupervised maritime vessel re-identification,pattern clustering,multilevel contrastive learning,maritime vessel re-ID,vessel identities,Training,large-scale annotated datasets,Representation learning,positive images,unlabeled vessel images,Surveillance,Task analysis,marine surveillance,"
"temporally stable feature clusters for maritime object tracking in visible and thermal imagery","2015","This paper describes a new approach to detect and track maritime objects in real time. The approach particularly addresses the highly dynamic maritime environment, panning cameras, target scale changes, and operates on both visible and thermal imagery. Object detection is based on agglomerative clustering of temporally stable features. Object extents are first determined based on persistence of detected features and their relative separation and motion attributes. An explicit cluster merging and splitting process handles object creation and separation. Stable object clusters are tracked frame-to-frame. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated on four challenging real-world public datasets.","Target tracking,infrared imaging,object detection,thermal imagery,maritime object detection,dynamic maritime environment,panning cameras,Accuracy,maritime object tracking,Real-time systems,object tracking,Cameras,Detectors,target scale,Feature extraction,"
"maritime target detection based on radar graph data and graph convolutional network","2022","Due to the complex sea clutter environment and target features, the conventional statistical theory-based methods cannot achieve high performance in maritime target detection tasks. Conventional deep learning, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs)-based target detection methods process each signal sample independently, and the temporal-spatial domain correlation information is seldom used. To achieve full utilization of information contained in radar signals and improve the detection performance, a graph convolutional network (GCN) is considered, which has shown great advantages in graph data processing and has been applied in the field of signal processing. This letter proposed a maritime target detection method based on radar signal graph data and graph convolution. Graph structure data is applied to define the detection units and to represent the temporal and spatial information of detection units. The target detection of the signal corresponding to the nodes is conducted via GCN. Experimental results show that the proposed approach can effectively detect marine targets when the signal-to-noise ratio is above âˆ’5 dB and can effectively suppress false alarms in the pure clutter area, which is not adjacent to targets. Compared with the popular used CNN method, e.g., LeNet, the proposed method can achieve higher detection probability with the same given false alarm rate.","marine radar,deep learning (artificial intelligence),signal processing,radar detection,graph data processing,radar clutter,graph convolutional network,conventional statistical theory-based methods,radar signals,Feature extraction,sea clutter,signal sampling,Manganese,deep learning,radar target detection,temporal-spatial domain correlation information,object detection,radar signal graph data,convolutional neural networks-based target detection methods,Radar,graph theory,Convolution,radar signal processing,convolutional neural nets,graph structure data,Graph convolutional network (GCN),higher detection probability,graph data,temporal information,CNN method,marine targets,maritime target detection method,Clutter,Object detection,signal-to-noise ratio,radar graph data,maritime target,Radar detection,spatial information,"
"path orthogonal matching pursuit for sparse reconstruction and denoising of swir maritime imagery","2018","We introduce an extension that may be used to augment algorithms used for the sparse decomposition of signals into a linear combination of atoms drawn from a dictionary such as those used in support of, for example, compressive sensing, k-sparse representation, and denoising. Our augmentation may be applied to any reconstruction algorithm that relies on the selection and sorting of high-correlation atoms during an analysis or identification phase by generating a 'path' between the two highest-correlation atoms. Here we investigate two types of path: a linear combination (Euclidean geodesic) and a construction relying on an optimal transport map (2-Wasserstein geodesic). We test our extension by performing image denoising and k-sparse representation using atoms from a learned overcomplete kSVD dictionary. We study the application of our techniques on SWIR imagery of maritime vessels and show that our methods outperform orthogonal matching pursuit. We conclude that these methods, having shown success in our two tested problem domains, will also be useful for reducing 'basis mismatch' error that arises in the recovery of compressively sampled images.","image denoising,Matching pursuit algorithms,path orthogonal matching pursuit,highest-correlation atoms,Image reconstruction,compressively sampled images,SWIR maritime imagery,high-correlation atoms,Euclidean geodesic,Dictionaries,image matching,image representation,linear combination,SWIR imagery,2-Wasserstein geodesic,orthogonal matching pursuit,Standards,Noise reduction,compressed sensing,optimal transport map,image reconstruction,Correlation,learned overcomplete kSVD dictionary,compressive sensing,k-sparse representation,reconstruction algorithm,sparse reconstruction,Imaging,learning (artificial intelligence),identification phase,"
"satellite surveillance of fishing vessel activity in the ascension island exclusive economic zone and marine protected area","2019","Designation of large expanses of the ocean as Marine Protected Area (MPA) is increasingly advocated and realised. The effectiveness of such MPAs, however, requires improvements to vessel monitoring and enforcement capability. In 2014 commercial fishing was excluded from the Ascension Island Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). In 2015, through updated regulations, a licenced fishery re-opened in the northern half of the EEZ while the southern half remained closed. To assess compliance with these closures and regulations, several promising satellite technologies (Satellite Automatic Identification System (S-AIS), Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) of two vessels), were trialled alongside at-sea patrols. Use of SAR enabled assessment of ‘dark’ (non-AIS transmitting) vessels, the scope of whose activities are hardest to gauge. The high level of compliance with regulations observed, suggests the MPA may prove effective, yet a need for vigilance remains. Vessels aggregate near the EEZ border and a quarter of vessels tracked across three years exhibited S-AIS transmission gaps and present a heightened compliance risk. Use of remote, rather than local, expertise and infrastructure provide a blue-print and economies of scale for replicating monitoring across similarly sized MPAs; particularly for large (>~ 25 m) vessels with metallic superstructures conducive to SAR detection. Funding ongoing monitoring in Ascension is challenged by current levels of license uptake, which provides insufficient offsetting revenue. Satellite-derived intelligence, can be used to set risk thresholds and trigger detailed investigations. Planning long-term monitoring must, however, incorporate adequate resources for follow-up, through patrols and correspondence with flag-states and fisheries management organisations.","Satellite surveillance,Marine Protected Area,Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction,Compliance,High seas,Fisheries,"
"maritime radar target detection in sea clutter based on cnn with dual-perspective attention","2023","Radar-based maritime target detection plays an important role in ocean monitoring. Considering the practical application, pulse-compression radar is widely used in terms of civilian offshore surface target detection. The existence of sea clutter will greatly interfere the detection performance of pulse-compression radar. This leads to the low detection performance of traditional algorithms like constant false alarm rate (CFAR). Deep learning methods have made strides in many fields recently, such as natural language processing and speech recognition. Inspired by this idea, we propose a maritime radar target detection method in sea clutter based on convolution neural network (CNN) and dual-perspective attention (DPA). The proposed method first encodes the radar echo in high-dimensional space and then extracts the correlation features from the global and local perspectives through the attention mechanism. We deployed the X-band pulse-compression radar on the coast of Hainan, China, and collected a lot of measured data. Experimental results demonstrate that the detection performance of our method outperforms the traditional CFAR methods and the latest deep learning-based methods. In the measured dataset, our proposed method can reach a detection probability of 93.59% under a false alarm rate (FAR) of  $1e-3$ , reaching the practical application level.","latest deep learning-based methods,maritime target detection,deep learning (artificial intelligence),radar detection,radar clutter,Feature extraction,natural language processing,global perspectives,traditional CFAR methods,sea clutter,attention mechanism,detection probability,CNN,X-band pulse-compression radar,civilian offshore surface target detection,object detection,convolution neural network,pulse-compression radar,feature extraction,radar-based maritime target detection,local perspectives,maritime radar target detection method,Radar clutter,Radar,Convolution,convolutional neural nets,constant false alarm rate,low detection performance,dual-perspective attention,speech recognition,probability,Clutter,Deep learning,Object detection,radar echo,learning (artificial intelligence),Radar detection,"

"random finite set tracking for anomaly detection in the presence of clutter","2020","In this paper, a sequential Bayesian framework is proposed to address the task of joint anomaly detection and tracking for surveillance applications in the presence of clutter. This is achieved by modeling the anomaly as a switching unknown control input which goes into action by modifying the expected dynamics of a target and ceases its activity (becomes nonexistent) under nominal behavior. Random Finite Sets (RFS) make it possible to represent the switching nature of the object anomalous behavior and derive a hybrid Bernoulli filter (HBF) that sequentially updates the joint posterior density of a Bernoulli RFS for the unknown velocity input and the object kinematic state. In addition, the proposed HBF has been customized for maritime anomaly detection by using a piecewise Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) stochastic process as dynamic model of vessels.

"infrared maritime target detection based on iterative corner and edge weights in tensor decomposition","2023","High-precision infrared maritime target detection plays an important role in early warning, monitoring, search, and rescue. The methods of decomposing the original image into low-rank background components and sparse target components show favorable detection performance. However, the strong edge interference is also sparse and may be mistakenly taken as target components, resulting in a large number of false alarms and reducing detection accuracy. To solve the problem, we propose an iterative corner and edge weights method based on tensor decomposition. The original image is decomposed into the background component, target component, and additional strong edge interference component. The corner strength is designed as the weight of the target component, and the edge strength is designed as the weight of the interference component in order to separate the target and interference more accurately. And the two weights are designed to be updated during each iteration of the model solution to reduce the impact of initial imprecise weights on detection results.

"vc-gan: classifying vessel types by maritime trajectories using generative adversarial networks","2020","As maritime transport is the backbone of global trade, it is important to ensure the safety and security for sea transportation effectively. However, the dependence on experienced human operators for maritime surveillance does not scale in terms of coverage. While the ship information and trajectory data from the Automatic Identification System (AIS) can be used to automate maritime surveillance, the AIS data may be modified deliberately or accidentally, resulting in difficulties in the detection of illegal maritime activities.

"an automated sar-based method for ship detection in maritime surveillance system","2023","Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is an active Earth observation system that can obtain high-resolution ocean images all day and all weather. It can be used for monitoring the marine environment, maritime traffic, and oil spills at sea. SAR provides accurate and real-time ocean information, which can ensure water traffic safety and ecological environment. Therefore, it plays an irreplaceable role in maritime surveillance. At present, deep-learning based object detection methods have achieved certain results in the application of ship detection in SAR images. Ship targets in SAR images have strong angular reflection characteristics, causing some parts of them to have large grayscale values, appearing as scattering points. At the same time, the heading of ship usually has a certain angle with the horizontal direction. Traditional deep-learning models do not have sufficient generalization ability for these situations. Horizontal bounding boxes also contain a large amount of background features, which affects the accuracy of the model. In response to these characteristics, first use convolutional neural network to extract ship features; Secondly, generate oriented proposals to reduce the impact of background features; Thirdly, using Canny and Harris to obtain features of ship edges and scattering points as attention mechanisms to enhance bounding box regression and classification; Finally, optimize the loss function, which will consider the influence of angle. Comparative experiments were conducted on the SSDD dataset, and the experimental results showed that compared to existing methods, the improved model has better ship detection performance and can achieve accurate detection of small ship targets in complex scene SAR images.","Oceans,ship detection in SAR images,ship edge,Object detection,scattering key point,Surveillance,Radar polarimetry,attention mechanism,Scattering,Biological system modeling,Feature extraction,maritime surveillance,"
"enhanced winter snowmelt in the antarctic peninsula: automatic snowmelt identification from radar scatterometer","2020","Surface snowmelt affects the energy balance through melt-albedo feedback and may endanger the ice shelves in the Antarctic Peninsula (AP) through hydrofracture. Here, we introduce an automatic snowmelt identification algorithm based on Quick Scatterometer and Advanced Scatterometer. The proposed method can provide self-adaptive thresholds for snowmelt detection based on Rosin thresholding, and is able to detect weak melt signals with a wavelet denoising procedure. Results suggest the AP surface snowmelt has slightly declined during 1999–2018 in the context of recent cooling. However, winter melt index (i.e., melt days times the area of melting) has significantly increased (above the 99% confidence level) with a rate of 83% decade−1. Unprecedented winter snowmelt was found in 2015/2016 when about one-third of the AP experienced snowmelt in late May. This may be attributed to the intrusions of marine air and the enhanced föhn-driven warming resulted from the abnormal northwesterly flow driven by a significant deepening of the Amundsen Sea Low.","Rosin thresholding,Winter snowmelt,Scatterometer,Antarctic Peninsula,Wavelet denoising,"
"asynchronous trajectory matching-based multimodal maritime data fusion for vessel traffic surveillance in inland waterways","2023","The automatic identification system (AIS) and video cameras have been widely exploited for vessel traffic surveillance in inland waterways. The AIS data could provide vessel identity and dynamic information on vessel position and movements. In contrast, the video data could describe the visual appearances of moving vessels without knowing the information on identity, position, movements, etc. To further improve vessel traffic surveillance, it becomes necessary to fuse the AIS and video data to simultaneously capture the visual features, identity, and dynamic information for the vessels of interest. However, the performance of AIS and video data fusion is susceptible to issues such as data spatial difference, message asynchronous transmission, visual object occlusion, etc. In this work, we propose a deep learning-based simple online and real-time vessel data fusion method (termed DeepSORVF). We first extract the AIS-and video-based vessel trajectories, and then propose an asynchronous trajectory matching method to fuse the AIS-based vessel information with the corresponding visual targets. In addition, by combining the AIS-and video-based movement features, we also present a prior knowledge-driven anti-occlusion method to yield accurate and robust vessel tracking results under occlusion conditions. To validate the efficacy of our DeepSORVF, we have also constructed a new benchmark dataset (termed FVessel) for vessel detection, tracking, and data fusion. It consists of many videos and the corresponding AIS data collected in various weather conditions and locations. The experimental results have demonstrated that our method is capable of guaranteeing high-reliable data fusion and anti-occlusion vessel tracking.

"the significance of spectral position in the rhodopsins of tropical marine fishes","1973","Visual pigments were extracted from the retinae of a large and diverse sample (179 species, in 40 families) of tropical marinefishes. By the method of partial bleaching, most of these were found to be retinal-1 pigments, with their maxima tightly grouped between 489 and 502 nm; but a few have λmax at shorter wavelengths. The spectral position of these pigments does not correlate with diurnal or nocturnal activity patterns, nor do closely related species necessarily have similar pigments. In general, the deeper-living species have rhodopsins with λmax at shorter wavelengths, a correlation with the bluer quality of light in deeper water. The spectral distribution of light was measured in air and underwater at a coral atoll. During twilight the underwater spectrum narrows and shifts to shorter wavelengths, as a result of increased absorption of yellow-orange light by the atmosphere. This effect at twilight is unique among the general spectral events that constitute each day. The behavioral patterns of reef fishes make clear the relationships between underwater light and the visual pigments. During evening twilight, there is an orderly sequence, in which the diurnal fishes seek cover, and then, after a “Quiet Period”, the nocturnal species emerge. The “Quiet Period” is the most critical and visually difficult time because light intensities are transitional between the thresholds of photopic and scotopic vision. Predation reaches a maximum during the “Quiet Period”. The rhodopsins of all these fishes tend to match the background light available during evening and morning twilight. Photochemically, visual sensitivity is maximized and, as a result, predation is held in check. The relationships between light, behavior and visual physiology are discussed. Although their rhodopsins are spectrally similar to those of the prey, crepuscular predators obtain a visual advantage by having moderate numbers of very large cones, which provide adequate sensitivity and sufficient resolution for motion detection.

"application of the jpda-ukf to hfsw radars for maritime situational awareness","2012","At the present day, growing interest is paid to the development of more reliable surveillance systems for maritime situational awareness (MSA).

To combat the complex and variant marine channel conditions induced by the absorption, scattering, and turbulence influence, in this article, we propose a general orthogonal transform (OT) aided multiple input multiple output (MIMO) transmission scheme to enhance the transmission reliability performances. In our design, we propose to construct the orthogonal transform matrix recursively with the Hadamard matrix. Thus we could exploit the repetitive property of the elements in the orthogonal matrix to enlarge the Euclidean distances among the signals. Moreover, the value of the elements could be adjusted dynamically to adapt to time-changing channel conditions. Thanks to the orthogonality of the matrix, and the singular value decomposition (SVD), the interferences among signals could be effectively suppressed. Accordingly, the reliability performances can be improved. Furthermore, we derive the theoretical symbol error rate (SER) expressions for the proposed design. Numerical simulations are performed to validate the theoretical analysis. Furthermore, the SER performances with different water types, and wind speeds in various scenarios of the atmosphere, underwater, and air-water interface channels are investigated, and compared with the counterpart systems.","telecommunication network reliability,multiple input multiple output transmission scheme,underwater environment,Reliability engineering,user information,transmission reliability performances,Visible light communication,maritime visible light communication systems,matrix algebra,singular value decomposition,variant marine channel conditions,reliability,multiple input multiple output,Matrix decomposition,turbulence influence,free-space optical communication,Scattering,orthogonal transform aided MIMO design,Reliability theory,error statistics,Euclidean distances,orthogonal transform matrix,maritime visible light communication,wireless channels,symbol error rate expressions,reliable maritime visible light communications,SER performances,Hadamard matrix,marine communication,complex marine channel conditions,orthogonal transform,Air and underwater channels,MIMO communication,Transforms,air-water interface channels,"
"maritime target tracking from an airborne multi-channel radar","2022","Detection and tracking of small maritime targets using high-resolution airborne radar is a difficult problem due to the non-stationary and non-Gaussian nature of sea clutter. This paper develops a target tracking algorithm for a scanning multi-channel radar operating in the maritime environment. The detection scheme uses space time adaptive processing (STAP) with a relatively high false alarm rate. While this improves the overall probability of detection, there are also a multitude of false (spurious) detections. As the radar scans, the target is illuminated over a range of azimuth angles, resulting in a large number of detections per target. A solution based on clustering the STAP output is proposed to create equivalent point target measurements, with the clustering output subsequently processed by a standard point-detection Bernoulli tracking filter. Through numerical simulations of high-fidelity airborne radar data, we demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves reliable tracking of targets characterised with low signal-to-interference ratios.","airborne radar,Clustering algorithms,radar scans,radar detection,radar clutter,equivalent point target measurements,STAP,high-resolution airborne radar,Sea measurements,sea clutter,false detections,STAP output,clustering output,space time adaptive processing,nonGaussian nature,target tracking,numerical simulations,maritime surveillance,Target tracking,small maritime target detection,object detection,extended target tracking,small maritime target tracking,detection scheme,signal-to-interference ratios,nonstationary nature,Radar,radar signal processing,high false alarm rate,airborne multichannel radar,target tracking algorithm,space-time adaptive processing,standard point-detection Bernoulli tracking filter,Airborne radar,maritime environment,probability,Surveillance,high-fidelity airborne radar data,Spaceborne radar,maritime target tracking,tracking filters,scanning multichannel radar,Radar detection,"
"ocean oil spill detection from sar images based on multi-channel deep learning semantic segmentation","2023","One of the major threats to marine ecosystems is pollution, particularly, that associated with the offshore oil and gas industry. Oil spills occur in the world's oceans every day, either as large-scale spews from drilling-rig or tanker accidents, or as smaller discharges from all sorts of sea-going vessels. In order to contribute to the timely detection and monitoring of oil spills over the oceans, we propose a new Multi-channel Deep Neural Network (M-DNN) segmentation model and a new and effective Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) image dataset, that enable us to emit forewarnings in a prompt and reliable manner. Our proposed M-DNN is a pixel-level segmentation model intended to improve previous DNN oil-spill detection models, by taking into account multiple input channels, complex oil shapes at different scales (dimensions) and evolution in time, and look-alikes from low wind speed conditions. Our methodology consists of the following components: 1) New Multi-channel SAR Image Database Development; 2) Multi-Channel DNN Model based on U-net and ResNet; and 3) Multi-channel DNN Training and Transfer Learning. Due to the lack of public oil spill databases guaranteeing a correct learning process of the M-DNN, we developed our own database consisting of 16 ENVISAT-ASAR images acquired over the Gulf of Mexico during the Deepwater Horizon (DWH) blowout, off the west coast of South Korea during the Hebei Spirit oil tanker collision, and over the Black Sea. These images were pre-processed to create a 3-channel input image IM = ","Oil spill detection,Deep learning,SAR images,Spatial filtering,"

Then, a long-time integration method based on dechirp processing and Fourier transform is utilized, concentrating each echo into Doppler centroid (DC) and Doppler frequency rate (DFR) domain.

With funding from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) National Center for Islands, Maritime, and Extreme Environments Security (CIMES), UAF partnered with Rutgers University, a partner in the DHS Center for Secure and Resilient Maritime Commerce (CSR) and CODAR Ocean Sensors to demonstrate multi-use MDA capability of SeaSondes to provide vessel detections simultaneously with surface current maps near Barrow, Alaska. The Arctic region poses challenges to HF Radar vessel detection including: remote locations requiring specialized shelter, power and communications; extreme weather; the presence of ice floes, which have their own Doppler echoes in addition to sea clutter; and a different radio environment with auroral influences.

"detection and tracking of ships in open sea with rapidly moving buoy-mounted camera system","2012","Visual surveillance in the maritime domain has been explored for more than a decade. Although it has produced a number of working systems and resulted in a mature technology, surveillance has been restricted to the port facilities or areas close to the coast line assuming a fixed-camera scenario. This paper presents a novel algorithm for open-sea visual maritime surveillance. We explore a challenging situation with a forward-looking camera mounted on a buoy or other floating platform. The proposed algorithm detects, localizes, and tracks ships in the field of view of the camera. Specifically, developed algorithm is uniquely designed to handle rapidly moving camera. Its performance is robust in the presence of a random relatively-large camera motion. In the context of ship detection we developed a new horizon detection scheme for a complex maritime domain.

"insights and guidance for offshore co2 storage monitoring based on the qics, eti mmv, and stemm-ccs projects","2020","Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is a collective term for technologies that allow society to unlock the benefits of energy intensive processes like fertiliser production and combustion of fuels (fossil or biologically sourced) without releasing the CO2 to the atmosphere. Hence, CCS could assist in accelerating decarbonisation while society pursues a just energy transition. This paper aims to summarise the learnings of three research projects that all investigated aspects of marine monitoring for CCS from a CO2 storage operator’s perspective. The QICS (Quantifying and Monitoring Potential Ecosystem Impacts of Geological Carbon Storage), ETI MMV (Energy Technologies Institute Measurement, Monitoring and Verification of CO2 Storage), and STEMM-CCS (Strategies for Environmental Monitoring of Marine CCS) projects collectively represent over twelve years of dedicated research to assess environmental impacts and to develop technologies for detection, location, and quantification of potential leakage from offshore geological storage of CO2. Each project used controlled releases in representative environments to test their methods and technologies. QICS as the first of the three projects, focused on the understanding of sensitivities of the UK marine environment to a potential leak from a CO2 storage complex and tested technologies to detect such emissions. The ETI MMV project brought together research and industry partners to develop and sea trial an operational, integrated and cost-effective marine monitoring system for geological CO2 storage. As a commercial project, these results have never been published before and this paper shares for the first-time insights from this work. In February 2020, STEMM-CCS, completed its quest to test techniques for environmental monitoring over a marine CO2 storage site in the UK North Sea, further improved near seabed leakage characterisation capabilities, and delivered a first marine CCS demonstration level ecological baseline. This paper aims to summarise some of the key insights from the three projects and provides references where available for the interested reader. The key finding of all three projects is that the impacts of small to medium CO2 leakages from large-scale storage are limited and localised. Technology capabilities exist for integrated marine CO2 storage monitoring and their performance has been benchmarked at controlled release trials. Even small leakages of 10−50 L/min can be detected at unknown locations in a large area of interest. Finally, the first important steps towards automated monitoring data analysis have been made, including automated leakage signal detection from Side Scan Sonar data (ETI MMV project) and automated species identification from marine biology images (STEMM-CCS project). Some remaining challenges include missed/false alerts because of large variations in the background signal, the cost of monitoring large areas over long periods, and making real-time decisions based on big data. Continued work to reduce the cost of marine monitoring technologies and advancing automation of data processing and analysis will be important in order to support safe and efficient offshore CCS deployment at large scale.","CCS,Location,Offshore CO2 storage,Regulation,Impact assessment,Quantification,Monitoring,Verification,Detection,Attribution,"

Modern Deep learning algorithms like CNN also aid in these missions. However, most models and datasets available focus on search and rescue missions on the ground or land. UAV-based search and rescue operations in the Maritime Scenario remain a challenge. This study focused on using deep learning algorithms such as CNN to precisely detect a human in peril with a swarm of drones. At the same time, we emphasize using swarm intelligence algorithms such as Particle Swarm Algorithm (PSO) to effectively find a victim in the shortest time by exploring a massive area.

"maritime moving target long time integration for gnss-based passive bistatic radar","2018","This paper addresses the exploitation of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) as transmitters of opportunity in passive bistatic radar systems for maritime surveillance. The main limitation of this technology is the restricted power budget provided by navigation satellites, which makes it necessary to define innovative moving target detection techniques specifically tailored for the system under consideration. To this aim, this paper puts forward long integration time techniques able to collect the signal energy over long time intervals (tens of seconds), allowing the retrieval of suitable levels of signal-to-disturbance ratios for detection purposes. A local plane based technique is first considered, providing target detection in a plane that represents the section of maritime area covered by the radar antenna. As a suboptimum solution in terms of achievable integration gain, but more efficient from a computational point of view, a second technique is considered working in the conventional bistatic range and Doppler plane (basic plane based). Results against synthetic and experimental datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.","moving target detection,GNSS-based passive bistatic radar,navigation satellites,forward long integration time techniques,radar detection,passive radar,radar antennas,Transmitters,Doppler plane,signal-to-disturbance ratios,Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) based passive radar,target tracking,passive bistatic radar (PBR),local plane based technique,maritime moving target long time integration,satellite navigation,maritime surveillance,object detection,radar antenna,Global Navigation Satellite Systems,innovative moving target detection,restricted power budget,Doppler radar,Passive radar,marine communication,Receivers,Surveillance,Spaceborne radar,Global navigation satellite system,"
"maritime traffic network extraction and application based on ais data","2021","The paper presents a data-driven approach for maritime traffic network extraction based on Automatic Identification System (AIS) data. A maritime traffic network, consisting of nodes that represent waypoint areas and navigational legs, is constructed to represent the maritime traffic at a larger scale. The proposed maritime traffic network extraction approach consists of three phases: 1) extraction of maritime traffic motion patterns based on historical Automatic Identification System data; 2) enrich the ship trajectories with semantic information and each ship trajectory is abstracted as an â€œorigin-waypoint-destinationâ€ itinerary object; 3) ship itinerary objects are further merged into nodes and edges of a directed maritime traffic network. Based on the maritime traffic network, a hierarchical reasoning approach is proposed to associate a partially observed ship trajectory to the derived compatible ship routes and ship abnormal behaviour can be detected. The presented method can assist maritime authorities to improve the efficiency of maritime traffic surveillance and to develop strategies to improve navigation safety.","Image edge detection,Semantics,surveillance,Transportation,Anomaly detection,image motion analysis,maritime traffic motion patterns,marine navigation,Knowledge engineering,maritime authorities,ships,directed maritime traffic network,marine safety,partially observed ship trajectory,navigation safety,Weather forecasting,Ship motion pattern,marine engineering computing,Maritime traffic network,Trajectory,maritime traffic network extraction,traffic engineering computing,Navigation,maritime traffic surveillance,AIS data,historical automatic identification system data,"

"target reflectivity and rcs interactions in integrated maritime surveillance systems based on surface-wave high-frequency radars","2001","Abnormal fluctuations have been observed in detected power levels of some of the targets during trials of the integrated maritime surveillance system (IMS) based on the Canadian east coast surface-wave high-frequency radar (HFSWR). The power level of most of the surface and air targets fluctuated within measurement-error limits (a few dB) during consecutive detections. These fluctuations have been observed to be more than 15 dB for a huge oil platform and nearby large tankers. These fluctuations are quite different than those observed in microwave radars, such as pulse-to-pulse or scan-to-scan fluctuations (which are modeled as different Swerling-type targets), and as are mentioned in most of the classical radar handbooks. In order to understand the reason behind these fluctuations, the behavior of the target reflectivity and radar cross section (RCS) of surface and air targets and their mutual RCS interaction were investigated. Powerful numerical techniques were used to model and understand the target reflectivity and RCS interactions, mostly in the resonance regime. Different scenarios were created, and the mutual RCS behavior of nearby large targets (such as oil tankers and/or fixed offshore oil platforms) as they were maneuvering were modeled. It was shown that 10 dB to 20 dB RCS fluctuations should be expected when targets interact, especially in the resonance regime.","marine radar,oil platform,radar detection,radar applications,surface-wave high-frequency radar,RCS interactions,maneuvering targets,Radar cross section,Petroleum,electromagnetic wave reflection,measurement-error limits,Radar scattering,surface electromagnetic waves,radar target detection,Offshore installations,oil tanker,surface-wave HF radar,Sea surface,search radar,air targets,detected power levels,Radar clutter,Fluctuations,Canadian east coast,target reflectivity,radar cross section,integrated maritime surveillance systems,surface targets,resonance regime,Surveillance,radar cross-sections,Reflectivity,Radar detection,"
"a data processing method of maritime surveillance radar on mechanical and electronical scanning mode","2020","The maritime surveillance radar is prone to have the problems of false track initiation and tracking loss due to the low tracking accuracy of the target using the traditional data processing strategy. To solve these problems, a data processing strategy is proposed based on a mechanical and electronical scanned radar. As the problem of velocity ambiguity is caused by far detection distance and low pulse repetition frequency (PRF), the overlapping algorithm is used and the corresponding constraints are employed for optimization. The problem of too many false tracks as a result of background noise is solved by using Hough transform and logic-based algorithm optimized under the relevant constraints. In addition, an optimization method of Kalman filtering is proposed based on the predicted value of the stable course of maritime targets to solve track jitter. The results of experiment show that this strategy is effective and improves the accuracy of radar in locating and tracking targets.","false tracks,electronical scanned radar,Kalman filters,marine radar,mechanical scanning mode,logic-based algorithm,radar detection,low pulse repetition frequency,target tracking,data processing method,false track initiation,tracking loss,track jitter,mechanical scanned radar,Kalman filtering,Hough transforms,object detection,optimisation,maritime targets,search radar,jitter,velocity ambiguity,overlapping algorithm,radar tracking,maritime surveillance radar,Hough transform,data processing strategy,electronical scanning mode,"

"system architecture for real-time condition monitoring and anomaly detection on ships","2023","Sea-based rescue organizations play a vital role in maritime civil security by resolving offshore emergencies, securing sea routes, and monitoring critical naval infrastructure. However, increasing marine traffic makes rescue operations more difficult, demanding better organization and orchestration of available resources. Therefore, ensuring efficient maintenance, availability and timely deployment of rescue cruisers is of great importance, particularly in rough sea conditions. To achieve this, we design an AI-based system for predictive maintenance and condition monitoring that enables real-time analyses of the shipâ€™s sensory data and the detection of anomalies in the system behavior. In this paper, we detail our software and hardware architecture for these purposes, and we discuss the respective requirements regarding onboard and off-ship data analysis from various data sources (sensor data, camera data, weather data).

After that, the radar illuminates each sub-scene in a probability calculated by a transfer-probability matrix. Finally, a compress sensing algorithm is utilized to reconstruct each sub-scene using the obtained sparse aperture echo data, and the whole wide swath image is joint by putting all the sub-scenes together.

The possibility of utilizing an elevator moving along a mast and thus change the antenna position in height implies for the future for each site to require only one antenna instead of - so far - two antennas, one antenna about 40 - 60 m aloft and another so-called Duct-antenna at ground level to meet the Duct problem.","maritime environment,meteorological conditions,duct situations,marine radar,Radar antennas,Ducts,Meteorological radar,radar detection,radar antenna height,optimal radar antenna heights,antenna position,Standards,radar antennas,Radar detection,"
"radar-based maritime collision avoidance using dynamic window","2018","Collision avoidance systems are a key ingredient in developing autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs). Such systems require real-time information about the environment, which can be obtained from transponder-based systems or exteroceptive sensors located on the ASV. In this paper, we present a closed-loop collision avoidance (COLAV) system using a maritime radar for detecting target ships, implemented on a 26 foot high-speed ASV. The system was validated in full-scale experiments in Trondheimsfjorden, Norway, in May 2017. The probabilistic data association filter (PDAF) is used for tracking target vessels. The output from the PDAF is processed through a least-squares retrodiction procedure in order to provide the COLAV system with sufficiently accurate course estimates. A tracking interface provides estimates of target states to the COLAV system, which is based on the dynamic window (DW) algorithm. DW is a reactive COLAV algorithm originally designed for ground vehicles, and we therefore make a number of modifications to adapt it for use with high-speed ASVs. The closed-loop experiments demonstrated successful COLAV with this system, but also disclosed several challenges arising from both the DW algorithm and the tracking system, motivating for further work.","sensor fusion,transponder-based systems,exteroceptive sensors,course estimates,collision avoidance systems,transponders,dynamic window algorithm,PDAF,target tracking,reactive COLAV algorithm,ships,COLAV system,closed loop systems,maritime collision avoidance,Target tracking,real-time information,Radar tracking,autonomous surface vehicles,Artificial intelligence,vessels,tracking system,Telemetry,mobile robots,Sensors,closed-loop collision avoidance system,high-speed ASV,collision avoidance,probabilistic data association filter,Heuristic algorithms,maritime radar,"
"lmd-tshipâ‹†: vision based large-scale maritime ship tracking benchmark for autonomous navigation applications","2021","Accurate ship tracking is very important for the security of maritime activities, especially the raising requirements of autonomous navigation applications, e.g., autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs). Unlike deep-learning-based object-tracking methods are prevailing in autonomous driving because of good environmental robustness and high tracking accuracy, few deep-tracking models can be found for maritime ships. The main reason for that is the lack of qualified ship datasets, especially datasets with ship-based perspectives. Therefore, a large-scale, high-definition dataset for ship tracking, LMD-TShip (Large Maritime Dataset), is provided in this paper. In this dataset, five types of ships are included, from cargo ships, fishing ships, passenger ships, and speed boats to unmanned ships. Specifically, LMD-TShip consists of 40,240 frames in 191 videos, each of which is carefully and manually annotated with bounding boxes in YOLO format. Moreover, 13 attributes are used to label videos, e.g., scale variation (SV), occlusion (OCC), basically covering tracking challenges of maritime ship tracking. Next, a detailed analysis is carried out to demonstrate the characteristics of LMD-TShip. Finally, experiments with five baseline short-term tracking models on the dataset are performed, e.g., ECO, SiamRPN++, and the experimental results demonstrate its good evaluation ability, which will provide effective means for training and testing tracking models related to maritime ships.","LMD-TShip,speed boats,Hidden Markov models,YOLO format,Cameras,Marine vehicles,tracking accuracy,cargo ships,ship tracking dataset,Videos,Visual tracking,video annotation,object tracking,ships,maritime activities security,Biological system modeling,unmanned ships,boats,Target tracking,object detection,deep-learning-based object-tracking methods,image annotation,Radar tracking,autonomous surface vehicles,telerobotics,autonomous driving,video signal processing,maritime environment,unmanned surface vehicles,mobile robots,passenger ships,deep-tracking models,vision based large-scale maritime ship tracking benchmark,autonomous navigation,fishing ships,Large Maritime Dataset,autonomous navigation applications,"
"target extraction and imaging of maritime targets in the sea clutter spectrum using sparse separation","2017","Detection and imaging of endoclutter maritime targets is a difficult problem, because the signal return of the target and the clutter overlap in both Doppler frequency and time.

"gis-enabled maritime awareness system (gmas)","2009","Being aware of maritime activities is important for homeland security. We have worked with the US Coast Guard to develop a waterway visual surveillance system on Elba Island, in Savannah, GA for maritime awareness. With the system, we developed an enhanced temporal difference algorithm based on active zone (ETD-AZ) to detect waterway moving objects, including container ships, commercial vessels, small vessels, sailboats, tugboats, and dolphins, etc. In the algorithm, active zone is first defined to model the imaging locations of moving objects that appear in the waterway; the model reduces noises caused by winds, clouds, and waves in the near-view fields. A thresholded difference map is computed by using temporal difference and thresholding methods. The thresholded difference map is further processed by applying morphological operations to remove noises. A final decision rule is derived to decide whether an image contains moving objects or not based on motion pixels in thresholded difference map and in the difference map after morphological operation. The proposed ETD-AZ algorithm has been tested using 21, 844 night and day images taken from Aug. 1-2, 2008, in different weather conditions: sunny, cloudy, windy, stormy with lightening, etc. The algorithm detected 89 of 94 waterway moving objects with 5.3% false negative rate while maintaining a low false positive rate of 4.0% for a total of 21, 478 non-object images.

"evaluation of uav and satellite-derived ndvi to map maritime antarctic vegetation","2020","Expansion of Antarctic vegetation in ice-free areas underlines the need for effective remote sensing techniques to properly monitor the changes. Detection and mapping of vegetation remains limited in the Antarctic environment given the complexity of its surface coverage. Some cryptogamic species exhibit low reflectance in the near-infrared region and are not easily detected by vegetation indices, such as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). In addition, spectral reflectance of Antarctic vegetation is highly variable according to seasonal conditions, which may influence NDVI results. As ultra-high resolution aerial imagery allows for a detailed analysis of vegetation and enables the validation of satellite imagery, in this study we assess the ability of the NDVI from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), Sentinel-2, and Landsat 8 to identify vegetated areas in the ice-free environment of Hope Bay, Antarctic Peninsula. NDVI classification with class ranges set by statistical parameters (i.e., mean and standard deviation) is performed. The results show that different sensors provide different NDVI values for the same vegetation class. NDVI classification enabled the identification of areas showing vegetation cover, which are in accordance with the manually mapped areas in the UAV image. Correspondence in vegetation distribution and classes can be observed across all classifications, demonstrating that aerial and satellite imagery may be used for Antarctic vegetation monitoring. A close association between NDVI classes and Antarctic vegetation type is identified, where lichens are generally classified in lower probability classes, and algae and moss in higher probability classes. This article shows the potential of NDVI applied to Antarctic vegetation and the significance of data statistical parameters in the selection of thresholds, reducing the need for ground-truth information in remote areas.","Landsat,NDVI,Sentinel-2,Remote sensing,Vegetation mapping,Antarctica,UAV,"

"the lama system: a “smart” magnetometer network for harbour protection","2022","This work describes the development of an underwater anti-intrusion system based on a magnetometer self-informed network, whose purpose is to detect the presence of threats in the proximity of critical infrastructures (e.g, terrorist divers in harbours). In this context, the magnetic network fills the gaps of sonar systems at the critical boundaries of the water volume to be controlled (sea bed, docks, …), where acoustic performances deteriorate due to reflections and attenuations. The system operates in a port-protection scenario, characterized by a medium-high environmental magnetic noise that can hide the diver signal (a diver is a weak, quasi-point-like, moving source). The magnetometer network processes two inputs: the environmental magnetic noise and a signal including the target magnetic signal superimposed to the same noise; the frequencies of a diver signal lie within the noise band, hence frequency filtering proves inadequate for noise removal. The basic idea underlying the system is to measure and use the noise itself to filter the overall signal; measuring noise supports a background-subtraction process that allows to extract the target signal and therefore detect the threat presence. The effectiveness of the procedure depends on the positions of magnetometers: sensors must be close enough to one another to measure the common background noise, and, at the same time, should be distant enough from one another so that just one sensor can measure the target signal. To generate alarms when a threat is detected, a real-time software application processes data and activates a visual and acoustic alarm upon identification of a magnetic anomaly. Sea trials carried out in port areas provided extremely satisfactory results in the detection of intruders. The paper presents experimental results obtained during the method validation tests, when intruders were moving in the surrounding undersea environment.","Environmental magnetism,Marine geophysics,Time series analysis,Magnetic anomaly detection,Underwater magnetic systems,Harbour protection,"
"detecting infrared maritime targets overwhelmed in sun glitters by antijitter spatiotemporal saliency","2019","When detecting infrared maritime targets on sunny days, strong sun glitters can lower the detection accuracy tremendously. To this problem, we proposed a robust antijitter spatiotemporal saliency generation with parallel binarization (ASSGPB) method. Its main contribution is to facilitate to improve the infrared maritime target detection accuracy in this situation. The ASSGPB algorithm exploits the target's spatial saliency and temporal consistency to separate real targets from clutter areas. The ASSGPB first corrects image intensity distribution with a central inhibition difference of Gaussian filter. Then, a self-defined spatiotemporal saliency map (STSM) generator is used to generate an STSM in five consecutive frames while compensating interframe jitters by a joint block matching. Finally, a parallel binarization method is adopted to segment real targets in STSM while keeping full target areas. To evaluate the performance of ASSGPB, we captured eight different image sequences (20420 frames in total) that were significantly contaminated by strong sun glitters.

"comparative analysis of positioning capability of beidou and gps in maritime islands","2022","After the full deployment of the Beidou-3 global satellite navigation system constellation, the positioning service range has been expanded from the Asia-Pacific region to the whole world. At present, most of the research on the positioning capability of Beidou system is on the mainland, and there is still room for research on the positioning capability of islands at sea. In this paper, the data of four IGS tracking stations distributed in islands are selected and solved by Anubis software. The visualization of Beidou and GPS is analyzed in five aspects: satellite visible number, standard single point positioning error, DOP value, signal-to-noise ratio, and multi-path effect. The results show that: (1) In the Asia-Pacific region, the positioning accuracy of Beidou's maritime islands is better than 0.734 m, 0.724 m, and 2.115 m in the N, E, and U directions, respectively, which is basically equivalent to GPS. Whereas, it is roughly 3 m, 3 m and 6 m lower than GPS outside the Asia-Pacific region, and the average number of visible satellites of Beidou in ANMG station and SOLO station is 15 and 11 respectively, which presumably means that the satellite density of Beidou system in the Asia-Pacific region is higher. (2) The average values of signal-to-noise ratio and multipath error of C22, C23, C24 and C25 stars of BeiDou are 41.638 dBHz and 0.574 m, respectively, which are basically comparable to those of G01, G02, G03 and G04 stars of GPS.

"visual analytics for the detection of anomalous maritime behavior","2008","The surveillance of large sea areas often generates huge amounts of multidimensional data. Exploring, analyzing and finding anomalous behavior within this data is a complex task. Confident decisions upon the abnormality of a particular vessel behavior require a certain level of situation awareness that may be difficult to achieve when the operator is overloaded by the available information. Based on a visual analytics process model, we present a novel system that supports the acquisition of situation awareness and the involvement of the user in the anomaly detection process using two layers of interactive visualizations.

"learning ship activity patterns in maritime data streams: enhancing cep rule learning by temporal and spatial relations and domain-specific functions","2023","Maritime surveillance systems are of particular importance for the smooth and safe operation of maritime traffic. Such systems must efficiently analyze the continuous stream of incoming ship movement data to provide an up-to-date picture of the situation at sea. Complex Event Processing (CEP) is a software technology dedicated to the analysis of data streams in real time and seems to be promising for maritime surveillance as well. CEP is based on rules that usually have to be formulated manually by domain experts. Recently, several approaches of learning CEP rules have been proposed. However, all these approaches are limited to standard CEP rule languages which are not well suited for describing maritime situations. In this paper, we extend Bat4CEP, an innovative bat-inspired approach to automatic CEP rule learning, to meet the specific needs of the maritime domain. In particular, we extend the rule language of Bat4CEP to include temporal-spatial operators and domain-specific functions. This extended rule language makes it possible to express complex maritime facts in a simple and understandable form. Furthermore, it is shown how the proposed rule language extensions can be integrated into the Bat4CEP learning approach. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated through extensive experiments with real maritime data streams.","Seaports,metaheuristics,Metaheuristics,Standards,Artificial intelligence,Maritime transportation,Surveillance,interpretable AI,Real-time systems,complex event processing,Marine vehicles,maritime data analytics,machine learning,"
"gwvt: a gpu maritime vessel tracker based on the wisard weightless neural network","2017","Maritime surveillance systems increase the security of ports and ships. The video tracking is an important and challenging component of a surveillance system. Difficulties can arise due to weather conditions, target trajectory and appearance, occlusions, lighting conditions and noise. The tracker locates the vessel frame by frame in real time. This paper proposes the GPU WiSARD Vessel Tracker GWVT, a maritime vessel tracker that uses the WiSARD weightless neural network and implemented on a GPU. The GPU parallel processing feature allows the tracking algorithm to be executed very fast.

"coarse-to-fine luminance estimation for low-light image enhancement in maritime video surveillance","2019","Captured images in maritime video surveillance under non-uniform illumination conditions easily suffer from low contrast and details loss. The low-quality images may significantly result in negative effects in practical applications, e.g., target detection, recognition, classification and tracking, etc. Increasing attention has recently been paid to improve the quality of low-light images via computer vision techniques. In this paper, we propose to establish a two-step luminance estimation framework to enhance low-light images. In particular, the coarse luminance is firstly estimated using traditional Max-RGB which extracts the highest pixel values in each color channel. The refined luminance is obtained by introducing a weighted variational model which has the capacities of structure-preserving and texture-smoothing. Based on the estimated well-constructed luminance, the enhanced low-light images are obtained by combining Retinex model with its extended version. The image quality is further improved through a BM3D-based denoising approach. Experimental results on both synthetic and realistic low-light images have demonstrated the satisfactory imaging performance in termsP of quantitative and qualitative evaluations.","Image enhancement,image denoising,Image restoration,Lighting,BM3D-based denoising approach,image enhancement,weighted variational model,Image color analysis,low-quality images,max-RGB,image colour analysis,Atmospheric modeling,retinex model,marine engineering,brightness,computer vision,object detection,image texture,synthetic low-light images,image reconstruction,color channel,image quality,realistic low-light images,low-light image enhancement,two-step luminance estimation framework,details loss,video surveillance,coarse-to-fine luminance estimation,Estimation,Channel estimation,maritime video surveillance,"

"maritime automated targets recognition algorithm test bed for high resolution isar imagery","2013","A maritime automatic target recognition system is under development to perform ship classification using images from inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) systems. This work will describe the algorithm framework for feature extraction, classification, and aim-point recognition. ISAR systems produce two-dimensional images of ships from the periodic motion inherent to all maritime objects and can be used to distinguish objects of interest for Homeland Security. There is a need for real-time classification of these objects. This work extends the state of the art in two ways: One - current maritime classification focuses on satellite ISAR, creating latency for classification[1]; and Two - work with Homeland Security ISAR radar systems is focused on concealed weapon detection [2,3]. This work uses localized ISAR images from stationary radars to classify maritime objects. Since the aspect and cross-range scale factor are continually changing, ISAR images form distinct representations unique to each object under observation. These distinct representations are analogous to visual images in many ways. They have unique shapes and areas of strong return, much in the same way objects in passive images have unique sizes and colors. However, ISAR images are synthetic portrayals of scattered field data from active sensor RF sensors whereas visual images are observations of passive sensors. This distinction must be a considered as a design constraint in the classification system - each feature employed must be exhaustively examined regarding its physical counterpart. Within that constraint, ISAR synthetic imagery feature extraction techniques can leverage from previous work developed for passive sensors. This is especially the case of High Range Resolution (HRR) ISAR systems. After extraction from ISAR prototype images, a set of representative features will be used to train a support vector machine (SVM) classifier, a supervised learning model capable of pattern recognition.","marine radar,active sensor,Inverse synthetic aperture radar,image motion analysis,Marine vehicles,Feature extraction,image colour analysis,supervised learning model,Target recognition,periodic motion,ships,radar computing,marine engineering,support vector machines,2D ship images,object detection,automated target recognition,synthetic aperture radar,feature extraction,image classification,maritime automated target recognition algorithm test bed,high range resolution ISAR imagery,RF sensors,Classification algorithms,SVM,homeland security ISAR radar systems,radar imaging,support vector machine classifier,Doppler effect,high resolution,Image segmentation,concealed weapon detection,weapons,satellite ISAR system,aim-point recognition,inverse synthetic aperture radar systems,stationary radars,Image resolution,national security,maritime object classification,image sensors,ship classification,learning (artificial intelligence),pattern recognition,passive sensors,object recognition,oceanographic techniques,"

"ship radial size estimation in high-resolution maritime surveillance radars via sparse recovery using linear programming","2019","For high-resolution maritime surveillance radars operating at scan mode and transmitting long duration pulses, radial size estimation of ships is severely interfered by range sidelobe effect of pulse compression. Due to range sidelobe effect, strong ship returns often cover a range interval wider than its radial size and the range interval covered by detected ship returns is sometimes a severe overestimate of its radial size. An approach to mitigate severe overestimation of ship radial sizes is to find the borders of high-resolution range profile (HRRP) of a ship. Therefore, ship radial size estimation boils down to the recovery of sparse HRRPs of ships from radar returns with heavy-tailed sea clutter in a coherent processing interval (CPI) only containing several pulses. In this paper, a sparse recovery method using linear programming (LP) is proposed to recover sparse HRRPs of ships from radar returns with heavy-tailed sea clutter. As a minor contribution, a full scheme is presented for ship radial size estimation in high-resolution surveillance radars operating at scan mode, which consists of coherent detection along with range cells, annotation of the range interval covered by ship returns, the decision of severe range sidelobe effect, recovery of sparse HRRPs of ships, and radial size computation. The performance of the proposed LP-based method to estimate ship radial size is evaluated by using simulated and real radar data.

"intelligent marine area supervision based on ais and radar fusion","2023","A weighted track fusion algorithm is proposed to address the complexity of conventional sea monitoring data and the lack of effective and convenient monitoring methods. The new algorithm uses local information entropy and fuses data from the automatic identification system (AIS) and X-band radar. The new model employs ship monitoring data to detect five types of abnormal ship behavior: speed, course, position, ship spacing, and time abnormalities. The method weights various factors using a weight matrix built up from a distance difference matrix between different track points and calculations of the distance information entropy and residual degree using information entropy theory. We tested the proposed weighted track fusion algorithm the fusion accuracy using actual data for 2813 ships, AIS, and radar track points based on local information entropy. The resulting correlation accuracy was 95.54% for 2716 ship track points and a correlation accuracy of 90.72% for 97 ship tracks. The results indicate that the proposed algorithm is suitable for fusing multiple tracks and is more robust than traditional fusion methods.","Intelligent supervision,Abnormal behavior,Radar,AIS,"
"airborne maritime surveillance using magnetic anomaly detection signature","2020","For an airborne sensor, there is a pressing need to be able to detect/track submerged submarines, shipwrecks, sea mines, unexploded explosive ordnance, and buried drums during maritime surveillance. Traditional usage is the magnetic anomaly detection (MAD), where the small changes in the earth's magnetic field caused by the ferrous components of the targets are measured. The primary means of long-range detection and classification of targets are with passive and active acoustic sensors, and MAD is used for accurate final localization. MAD could also be used for land-based targets but this is not common. Knowing the relationship between the magnetic signature and the kinematic parameters, the tracking problem can be formulated under a Bayesian framework. In this article, multiple nonlinear filters are used for a real single surface-target tracking problem in maritime surveillance using an airborne total-field sensor. The posterior CramÃ©r-Rao lower bound for MAD is derived. Given the total-field measurements, these filters can estimate the kinematic states as well as the permanent moments and induced moments effectively.

"a benchmark for deep learning based object detection in maritime environments","2019","Object detection in maritime environments is a rather unpopular topic in the field of computer vision.

We analyze the utilization of deep learning techniques and therefore evaluate two state-of-the-art object detection approaches for their applicability in the maritime domain: Faster R-CNN and Mask R-CNN. To train the Mask R-CNN including the instance segmentation branch, a novel algorithm for automated generation of instance segmentation labels is introduced.

"single image defogging based on illumination decomposition for visual maritime surveillance","2019","Single image fog removal is important for surveillance applications, and, recently, many defogging methods have been proposed. Due to the adverse atmospheric conditions, the scattering properties of foggy images depend on not only the depth information of scene but also the atmospheric aerosol model, which has a more prominent influence on illumination in a fog scene than that in a haze scene. However, the recent defogging methods confuse haze and fog, and they fail to consider fully the scattering properties. Thus, these methods are not sufficient to remove fog effects, especially for images in maritime surveillance. Therefore, this paper proposes a single image defogging method for visual maritime surveillance. First, a comprehensive scattering model is proposed to formulate a fog image in the glow-shaped environmental illumination. Then, an illumination decomposition algorithm is proposed to eliminate the glow effect on the airlight radiance and recover a fog layer, in which the objects at the infinite distance have uniform luminance. Second, a transmission-map estimation based on the non-local haze-lines prior is utilized to constrain the transmission map into a reasonable range for the input fog image. Finally, the proposed illumination compensation algorithm enables the defogging image to preserve the natural illumination information of the input image. In addition, a fog image dataset is established for the visual maritime surveillance. The experimental results based on the established dataset demonstrate that the proposed method can outperform the state-of-the-art methods in terms of both the subjective and objective evaluation criteria.

"maritime visible image classification based on double transfer method","2020","Image classification using deep transfer learning has received significant attention, benefiting from pre-trained with the large-scale annotation dataset and continuous improvement of neural network structure. In contrast to universal image classification, however, few publicly available datasets of maritime environments utilize deep transfer learning.

In this article, we proposed the double transfer method, consisting of the merging datasets network and the backbone network, to address the problem.

"coastal water bathymetry for critical zone management using regression tree models from gaofen-6 imagery","2021","Coastal water depth information is fundamental to coast management and coastal critical zone development. The traditional bathymetric sounding method depends on radar or surveying vessels, which are expensive and time-consuming. Thus, it is of high importance to develop a rapidly updating water depth detection method. In order to bridge this gap, we explored the Chinese Gaofen-6 wide field of view (GF-6 WFV) visible-near infrared satellite imagery for large-scale accurate coastal bathymetric mapping and to understand the vertical water column environment with regression tree models. The predictors, including the Blue band/Violet band (BV), Green band/Violet band (GV), Yellow band/Violet band (YV), Green band (G), Yellow band (Y), and red-edge1 band (Re1), were derived via statistical analysis, as well as spectroscopy knowledge and experience. Compared with the conventional bathymetric method, such as single band algorithm (SBA), band ratio algorithm and support vector regression (SVR), the two regression trees used in this study yielded better accuracy.

"assessment of offshore oil/gas platform status in the northern gulf of mexico using multi-source satellite time-series images","2018","Accurate knowledge of the detailed status (location and lifetime) of each oil/gas platform is crucial for ocean management and for understanding its potential environmental impact. However, this requirement is often compromised due to incomplete data records, especially when platform abandonment is not properly planned, designed, and/or executed. The availability of multi-source optical and SAR images provides the possibility of a systematic assessment, but the ubiquitous false positives and frequent geocoding errors make it technically challenging. Here, we develop a time-series remote sensing approach (TSRS) for detecting offshore platforms and determining their status, where the technical challenges are overcome using two strategies, as follows: (i) A stepwise optimization strategy applied to individual images and time-series images to mitigate numerous noises, to select platforms from candidates, and to assess platform status; and (ii) A cross geo-correction strategy using platforms derived from high-geometric accuracy images as ground control points to rectify poorly geo-referenced images. We applied the TSRS approach to the northern Gulf of Mexico using about 26,000 moderate-resolution optical/SAR images from eight satellites spanning the period from 1982 to 2017. TSRS detected a total of 9260 (5556) platforms in both Federal and State waters, including 3140 (1803) existing platforms, 5044 (3426) removed platforms, and 1076 (327) status-to-be-determined platforms where the numbers in parentheses represent those from Federal waters. Of these TSRS platforms, 4751 coincide spatially with 5476 (77.68%) of platform records of the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) platform database; 2846 (387 in Federal waters) are not found in the BSEE platform database but are convincingly supported by data from other sources (including BSEE-pipeline-database, time-series VIIRS nighttime light products, and littoral ground-truth images), meaning that 82.04% of the TSRS-derived platforms can be directly/indirectly confirmed. A site-specific validation in East Bay using multi-temporal ground-truth aerial images indicates that, for this site, the false negative rate (FNR) is ~9.63% and the false positive rate (FPR) is only 4.44%. The detailed beginning/end dates of the TSRS platforms are mostly confirmed by the corresponding Installation/Site-clear dates recorded in the BSEE platform database. Our findings suggest that the TSRS approach is a robust and cost-effective way to assess oil/gas platform status in large regions, and our results here may complement the official database, narrow down locations for future field investigations, and provide critical information for future assessment of the potential impacts of active and decommissioned platforms on the marine environments.","Landsat,Northern Gulf of Mexico,Offshore platform,Platform status assessment,Remote sensing,SAR,Time-series,"

"integrated x band active phased array radar for maritime surveillance","2021","Airborne maritime surveillance plays an important role in safeguarding the coastline and exclusive economic zones. A multi-functional Maritime Patrol Radar (MPR), which can provide 360 degree azimuth coverage and operate in various modes like sea surface surveillance, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), Inverse SAR (ISAR), Search-and-Rescue, Weather etc., is crucial for providing an effective maritime situational awareness. The performance of such systems are usually limited by sea clutter and aperture constraints imposed by the aircraft. Unlike the older generation mechanical radar, MPR based on Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) can overcome these limitations with its capability in instantaneous beam steering, spacetime agility etc. This paper performs an extensive simulation study on sea-clutter, derives the optimal system parameters and defines a prototype Integrated X-band Active Phased Array Radar (IXAPAR). Each building block of IXAPAR has been designed using state-of-the-art technology. Finally, we report the performance results of the IXAPAR including opportune target detection, with various advanced digital domain processing like Extended Target CA-CFAR, digital monopulsing, simultaneous multi-direction looks using digital beamforming and jammer cancellation.

To tackle this problem, we make use of the multichannel coherent single data set algorithm which removes the need for any training data, thus alleviating the problem of clutter heterogeneity.

"dynamic detection of water surface area of ebinur lake using multi-source satellite data (landsat and sentinel-1a) and its responses to changing environment","2019","In arid and semi-arid climatic areas, lakes are extremely essential for fragile ecological environment and regional sustainable development. Ebinur Lake is an important component of the ecological barrier of Junggar Basin, Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR), China. Due to the tremendous changes in Ebinur Lake and surrounding marshes during the last decades, Ebinur Lake becomes a representative ecological degradation region in northwestern China. The detection of the intra-annual variations of water body and its responses to changing environment are critical for regional ecological security and rehabilitation of degraded ecosystem. To extract more accurate water information using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data and further fill the gap of inter-month dynamic monitoring of Ebinur Lake, a new SAR water index (modified Sentinel 1A water index, MSWI) was proposed based on the relationship between normalized difference water index (NDWI) imageries and Sentinel 1A data. The dynamic thresholds of classification were selected using Otsu method and the results showed that the classification results were acceptable with the optimal overall accuracy of 99.94% and kappa coefficient of 0.9971, respectively. We conduct a time series analysis of surface areas of Ebinur Lake using S1A data from February 9th, 2017 to February 4th, 2018. The maximum lake surface area was 965.29 km2 in April 22nd, 2017, while the minimum value was 750.37 km2 in September 1st, 2017, and the mean area was 831.51 km2. The seasonal variations showed the stages of “sharp rising” – “significant decreasing” – “gradual stabilizing” in the study period. The water surface area was highly correlated with inflow water volume (correlation coefficient = 0.72, P < 0.001). The variation of Ebinur Lake's water surface area is crucial to monitor the resulting eco-environmental impacts under the changing environmental conditions in the arid and semi-arid areas.","Ebinur Lake,Water index,Sentienel-1A,Remote sensing,Eco-environmental impact,"

"enhanced sismaris: (systã¨me d'information et de surveillance maritime etendu pour l'identification des comportements suspects): enhanced maritime surveillance and information system for abnormal behaviour identification","2010","The number of ships and the diversity of threat in maritime surveillance increase every day. Tracking and monitoring from the coast all type of ship on a common operational picture is no more sufficient. An Innovative solution shall be set up to support human operators in their permanent surveillance tasks in vulnerable trading lanes and zones in order to detect abnormal or illicit vessel behaviour and to understand and to early identify threatening situations. Displaying thousands of tracks on a single display has be demonstrated its inefficiency, in front of all the cases of illegal immigration, terrorism, drugs trafficking, smuggling, illegal fishing, pollution, etc... that were recorded this year. This future generation of maritime surveillance system must allow: 1) Permanent and all weather coverage of border maritime areas. 2) Continuous collection and fusion of heterogeneous data provided by various types of sensors deployed on coast and on mobile platforms and other information from external sources. 3) Supervised automatic detection of abnormal vessel behaviours (in track and performed activity) and generate justified alarms. 4) Understanding of suspicious events and early identification of threats from series of detected spatiotemporal abnormal vessel behaviours (alarms). 5) Generate electronic and formatted interpretation reports on the suspicious event to keep periodically informed decisional authorities. 6) Anticipate the operational response mobilizing and using means with the best efficiency as possible 7) To capitalize knowledge and work of each partner, within an inter-agencies and international framework, for a common benefit on a real time basis 8) To ensure the data protection respecting the respective rules of information sharing.

"clutter suppression and target tracking by the low-rank representation for airborne maritime surveillance radar","2020","Moving target detection is of vital importance to maritime security and maritime resource protection. However, the detection of slow or weak targets is difficult based on traditional methods. A new detection method is proposed by using the different motion variations of radar moving target and sea clutter in the range-Doppler spectrum sequence. The first step in implementing this method is the separation of moving target and sea clutter by the low-rank representation, in which the target and clutter are modeled as foreground and background components. Subsequently, a sea clutter discriminator is constructed within the sea clutter bandwidth to further remove the sea clutter (false alarms) that exists in the foreground. The proposed method can reduce the sea clutter power while maintaining the target power and improve the detection rate of moving targets, especially slow or weak targets. Data collected with airborne maritime surveillance radar in maritime moving target indication (MMTI) mode are used to validate the performance of the proposed method. The experimental results demonstrate that the improvement in the signal-to-clutter ratio (SCR) obtained with the proposed method is better than that obtained with space-time adaptive processing (STAP, including 1DT-STAP, 3DT-STAP and sparse-STAP) and principal component pursuit (PCP) methods; additionally, the figure of merit (FOM) of the proposed method is higher than that of the constant false alarm rate (CFAR) and PCP method.

"ais data visualization for maritime spatial planning (msp)","2016","The constant increase in marine traffic and the simultaneous growth of the demand for exploiting marine areas (e.g., installing offshore wind power plants) require an adequate planning strategy for managing high traffic volumes. Maritime Spatial Planning (MSP) is the process of public development of an allocation plan for distributing, both spatially and temporally, human activities in marine areas. The adoption of e-Navigation is a possible solution for improving safety and security at sea by integrating maritime information on board and ashore. Automatic Identification System (AIS) data represents a fundamental source of information, since the analysis of AIS data can highlight the presence of congested areas as well as of illegal actions, such as smuggling, pollution, and unauthorized phishing in protected areas. Indeed, those activities are often characterized by abnormal manoeuvres that can be recognized by analyzing the routes of the vessels. However, the huge dimension of the AIS data to process requires the adoption of careful strategies for the data visualization. In this paper, we present a complete pipeline for visualizing ship routes from raw AIS data, which is a fundamental pre-requisite for carrying out a significant AIS-based route analysis, and describe a real case study, where 90 million AIS records, corresponding to one month of world-wide observations, are visualized using only open-source software.","AIS data visualization,route analysis,intelligent transport systems,e-Navigation,AIS data,"
"maritime surveillance using multiple high-frequency surface-wave radars","2014","In the last decades, great interest has been directed toward low-power high-frequency (HF) surface-wave radars as long-range early warning tools in maritime-situational-awareness applications. These sensors, developed for ocean remote sensing, provide an additional source of information for ship detection and tracking, by virtue of their over-the-horizon coverage capability and continuous-time mode of operation. Unfortunately, they exhibit many shortcomings that need to be taken into account, such as poor range and azimuth resolution, high nonlinearity, and significant presence of clutter. In this paper, radar detection, multitarget tracking, and data fusion (DF) techniques are applied to experimental data collected during an HF-radar experiment, which took place between May and December 2009 on the Ligurian coast of the Mediterranean Sea. The system performance is defined in terms of time on target (ToT), false alarm rate (FAR), track fragmentation, and accuracy. A full statistical characterization is provided using one month of data. The effectiveness of the tracking and DF procedures is shown in comparison to the radar detection algorithm. In particular, the detector's FAR is reduced by one order of magnitude.

"maritime target detection using frequency estimation","2020","Coherent detection schemes have been shown to offer performance benefits over non-coherent techniques in the maritime radar context. To further improve performance, the use of sparse representations with judiciously selected dictionaries has been proposed as a method to separate target returns from surrounding sea clutter. This paper exploits a robust frequency estimation scheme to effectively separate the target from clutter and noise. The approach offers two advantages: (1) it does not require a dictionary to be designed to support the scheme and (2) the scheme is capable of estimating multiple frequencies, thus suitable for targets with multiple Doppler components.

"the effectiveness of dazzlers for maritime security","2010","A dazzler, sometimes called an optical distracter, transmits a visually intense light, usually in a narrow beam, in order to 1) attract the attention of a person and to make them alert to other visual or audible warnings against approaching a protected asset in a threatening manner, or 2) to suppress the actions of noncompliant persons (continued advance or aiming of weapons) by obscuring their vision with disability glare. Dazzlers feature in land operations, at military check points in non-combat land operations, to momentarily distract an assailant, to alert drivers in vehicles approaching a check point, and to alert civilian traffic to approaching forces. Dazzlers are being considered for maritime security; for port protection, counter piracy, and critical infrastructure protection to warn the occupants of small boats and for suppressing the vision of noncompliant persons who may be intent on attacking. The distances of initial detection and warning for maritime operations are generally much longer (on the order of 300 to 3000 m) than the distances in land operations (50 to 300 m). Dazzler aiming is furthermore likely to be under automatic control rather than handheld as in land operations, in order to more control dwell time against a distant contact, and to provide a large operator-dazzler separation for operator safety in counter piracy. The requirements for dazzler effectiveness therefore change when going from land operations to maritime. Models of disability glare are used here to model and study the effectiveness of dazzlers for maritime security across changing ambient light conditions, with aiming uncertainties, and for different types of sources (coherent lasers versus incoherent spotlights). Key requirements for specifying a dazzler system are considered.","dazzler effectiveness,Lighting,Safety,military equipment,Disability Glare,Optical Distractor,Spotlight,Maritme Security,maritime security,optical distracter,noncombat land operations,military check points,Response Measures,visually intense light,marine safety,disability glare,Humans,laser beam applications,Laser beams,Uncertainty,Weapons,Visualization,laser dazzler,security,Laser Dazzler,automatic control,"

"maritime vessel traffic modeling in the context of concept drift","2017","Maritime traffic modeling serves the purpose of extracting human-readable information and discovering knowledge in the otherwise illegible mass of traffic data. The goal of this study is to examine the presence and character of fluctuations in maritime traffic patterns. The main objective is to identify such fluctuations and capture them in terms of a concept drift, i.e., unforeseen shifts in statistical properties of the modeled target occurring over time. The empirical study is based on a collection of AIS vessel tracking data, spanning over a year. The scope of the study limits the AIS data area to the Baltic region (9-31°E, 53-66°N), which experiences some of the most dense maritime traffic in the world. The investigations employ a novel maritime traffic modeling method based on the potential fields concept, adapted for this study to facilitate the examination of concept drift. The concept drift is made apparent in course of the statistical and visual analysis of the experimental results. This study shows a number of particular cases, in which the maritime traffic is affected by concept drifts of varying extent and character. The visual representations of the traffic models make shifts in the traffic patterns apparent and comprehensible to human eye. Based on the experimental outcomes, the robustness of the modeling method against concept drift in traffic is discussed and improvements are proposed. The outcomes provide insights into regularly reoccurring drifts and irregularities within the traffic data itself that may serve to further optimize the modeling method, and – in turn – the performance of detection based on it.","maritime traffic,concept drift,traffic modeling,anomaly detection,"
"object segmentation from a dynamic background using a pixelwise rigidity criterion and application to maritime target recognition","2014","This paper describes a novel approach for rigid object segmentation from a dynamic background using a pre-recorded video with a moving camera, and we apply it to the problem of vessel segmentation in a maritime video scene. The difficulty of modeling background appearance or/and dynamic, modeling object appearance, and compensating camera motion renders this task very challenging. Therefore, the proposed method only uses a geometric constraint regarding target motion rigidity in order to achieve object segmentation in a full video segment. Such an idea is not new in object segmentation literature, but the novelty in this paper resides in that the target rigidity assumption is implemented at the pixel level, but not at the object scale. This is firstly achieved by deriving a theoretical optic flow model in the neighborhood of each pixel under the 3D rigid motion assumption of object, which is later compared against the observed 2D optic flow model in the neighborhood of a pixel in order to derive a pixelwise rigidity criterion. The latter is further reenforced along individual (pixel) trajectories in a video segment. Finally, a mere thresholding operation allows to quickly extract target from background in a full video segment. Our experiments using real maritime video sequences captured with an airborne camera have shown that the method detects maritime targets accurately.","Optical imaging,rigid object segmentation,maritime target detection,dynamic background,motion compensation,Cameras,background appearance modeling,Solid modeling,object segmentation,2D optic flow model,maritime video sequences,pixel trajectories,vessel segmentation problem,prerecorded video,Integrated optics,marine engineering,Three-dimensional displays,object appearance modeling,maritime target recognition,object detection,geometric constraint,rigid object,Object segmentation,video signal processing,moving camera,maritime video scene,nonrigid dynamic background,Motion segmentation,optic flow,image sequences,pixelwise rigidity criterion,image sensors,computational geometry,image segmentation,airborne camera,object recognition,camera motion compensation,"

"an adaptive ionosphere clutter suppression and target detection method for hfswr maritime surveillance","2023","High-frequency surface wave radar (HFSWR) as a maritime surveillance facility faces the tough challenges. One of them is that various unwanted echo components constantly destroy the detection performance of HFSWR, especially the dynamically changing ionosphere clutter. This article proposes an adaptive ionosphere clutter suppression and target detection algorithm (AICSTD) based on improved higher order singular value decomposition (HOSVD) and deep learning network. First, we analyze the multiple-dimensional characteristics of different types of ionosphere clutter echo data. Then, refer to the multichannel HFSWR echo data structure, we apply simplified HOSVD and orthogonal subspace projection to eliminate the unwanted echo component and, meanwhile, preserve the target echo. The key parameter of simplified HOSVD is determined by the mean structural similarity (MSSIM) index, which contributes to reduce the computation complexity of the proposed method. Finally, we improved the deep learning network to detect the targets in various behaviors after the clutter suppression. In order to address the issue of limited clutter data, transfer learning based on historical radar echo data is applied. A thorough experimental analysis on various real clutter data shows that the proposed method performs competitively. Our method shows a superior performance over many state-of-the-art clutter suppression methods, with a covered target detection accuracy of 92.4% under strong spread clutter background.","Ionosphere,structural similarity (SSIM) index,higher order singular value decomposition (HOSVD),ionosphere clutter suppression,Tensors,Clutter,Deep learning,Object detection,Doppler effect,target detection,high-frequency surface wave radar (HFSWR),Reflection,"
"maritime target detection and tracking","2019","Method of object detection and tracking is one of hot topics in image processing and computer vision field, which is significant not only in military such as imaging guidance and military target tracking, but also for civil use such as security and monitoring and the intelligent man-machine interaction. For marine targets, how to eliminate interference effectively and achieve accurate detection of moving targets is a key problem to be solved. In this paper, we propose a method of image segmentation and line detection to detect the horizon, which can help to determine the area to be detected. We use prior knowledge to detect the ship target in this area. To identify the suspected ship, we detect it in multiple frames. After identifying the ship, we use the mean shift algorithm to lock tracked target.

"maritime linked data for situational awareness heterogeneous sensor networks","2021","Maritime heterogeneous sensor networks (HSN), which are widely used in support of marine monitoring, maritime security and safety applications, combine diversified sensing systems and platforms observing the state of environmental features of interest or the status of anthropogenic objects to achieve awareness on the situation. To model the information characteristics of HSN observations for maritime situational awareness (MSA), we developed the MSA-HSN ontology, an integrated semantic model for maritime linked data, specifically observations suiting the requirements of maritime information fusion systems. MSA-HSN integrates established ontologies and models for sensors, observations, measurements, quantities, and occurrents, tailored to MSA applications and requirements. To support the interoperability with existing maritime data models, MSA-HSN is aligned with the relevant aspects of the EUCISE/e-CISE (Common Information Sharing Environment) data models. As a validation use case, in this paper the MSA-HSN ontology is applied to model the information elements of the maritime surveillance system developed within the Interactive Extreme-Scale Analytics and Forecasting (INFORE) project, where different situational views offered by a variegate suite of sensors and platforms are fused using big data analytics to achieve maritime situational awareness for maritime security.

The current methods are struggling to enhance targets and suppress heavy waves because of the similar local contrast. In this letter, a weighted multidirectional gradient (WMDG) measure is presented. First, the candidate targets are extracted via facet model. Then multidirectional gradient and difference information are constructed to calculate average cumulative multidirectional gradient (ACMG) and achieve directional difference measure (DDM). Consequently, the final saliency is reconstructed via ACMG weighted by DDM. Finally, the actual targets are segmented through an adaptive threshold.

"unambiguous imaging for moving targets in maritime scenarios with dual receive channel mode of gf-3 satellite","2019","Gaofen-3 (GF-3) is the first Chinese multichannel synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensor that can operate in the dual receive channel (DRC) mode. Different from the traditional single-channel SAR system, the multichannel SAR system can overcome the inherent limitation to achieve high-resolution and wide-swath (HRWS) at the same time. However, the key challenge it faces is false target suppression. Especially for the moving vessels on the ocean, the existence of false targets will increase false alarm probability and affect the interpretation of SAR images.

"comparison of sparse signal separation algorithms for maritime radar target detection","2018","Due to the non-stationary nature of sea clutter, traditional maritime radar detection schemes utilise non-coherent processing. To further enhance the detection performance, one alternative is to use sparse signal separation. This is an alternative paradigm, whereby the different spatio-temporal characteristics of the radar signal are exploited to separate targets from the background interference. In previous work, the sparse signal separation problem has been posed in a compressive sensing framework so as to improve detection of small maritime targets. This paper investigates the performance of three different algorithms for solving the signal separation problem. These include the Split Augmented Lagrangian Shrinkage Algorithm (SALSA), adaptive Complex Approximate Message Passing (CAMP) and the Fast Sparse Functional Iteration Algorithm (FSFIA). The first contribution is to reformulate the CAMP algorithm to the framework of sparse signal separation.

"permeability and voids influence on the thermal signal, as inferred by multitemporal uav-based infrared and visible images","2020","This work presents for the first time associated thermal anomalies and deformations over subsurface cavities/voids located within two harbour quays in Le Havre Harbourg, Normandy, France. An U.A.V. (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) was used to acquire visible and thermal images over a diurnal cycle (from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m.). The visible images were processed to realize an altimetric model of the platforms by mean of the photogrammetric method, while the thermal infrared (TIR) images were used to study the evolution of their surface temperatures. The obtained 3D model shows the location of five topographic depressions on both quays. The analysis of the evolution of the surface thermal field leads to the detection of cold thermal anomalies that are (1) not correlated to surface properties, and (2) spatially associated to the flanks of the five topographic depressions. Using a 2D conductive-radiative model, we show that these anomalies are not directly due to the thermally insulating effect of an air-filled area. Finally, we conclude that preferential infiltration and subsequent evaporation in the micro-fracturation present within the flanks of the depressions may be responsible for the strong cooling of these zones.","Thermal infrared,Photogrammetry,Remote Sensing,infiltration,Subsurface cavity,Natural hazards,UAV,"

"background modeling in the fourier domain for maritime infrared target detection","2020","The estimation of the sea background from maritime infrared video sequences is necessary for target detection. It is challenging to obtain an accurate background model when the scene is a complex and fluctuating sea surface. However, the amplitude spectrum sequences at each frequency point of the pure seawater frames in the Fourier domain are more stable than the gray value sequences of each pixel in the spatial domain. Thus, the background is modeled with a Gaussian distribution in the Fourier domain with the mean and variance adapted over time. In addition, the sea background dynamics are introduced by the variance of the amplitude spectrum sequence, and the dynamic Gaussian discriminant coefficient is set up for each frequency point. Two target discrimination flags are presented based on the background dynamics and Gaussian discriminant process to extract the target more accurately. Furthermore, the entropy filter in the Fourier domain is designed to enhance the target and suppress the sea clutter.

"requirement on antenna cross-polarization isolation for the operational use of c-band sar constellations in maritime surveillance","2010","The issue of antenna cross-polarization isolation has been previously discussed for the design of fully polarimetric synthetic aperture radars (SARs). Dual-polarized antennas with cross-polarization isolation that is better than -30 dB are desirable for more convenient polarimetric data calibration since measurements of antenna crosstalk (magnitude and phase) variations with incidence angle are not required. For an antenna with significant polarization crosstalk, it is still possible to retrieve pure polarization measurements of HH, HV, VH, and VV provided that the four corresponding received voltages are measured. However, it is not possible to recover from cross-polarization contamination for single- or dual-polarization measurements. Therefore, it is important to set up a minimum requirement on dual-polarized antenna isolation so that single- and dual-polarization applications are not unduly affected. In this letter, the minimum requirement on cross-polarization antenna isolation is investigated for operational use of C-band SARs in maritime surveillance applications. Calibrated polarimetric RADARSAT-2 data are used to simulate single- and dual-polarization data with cross-polarization contamination for a dual-polarized antenna with cross-polarization isolation ranging from -20 to -35 dB. It is shown that the cross-polarization HV (or VH) channel can be significantly affected, particularly at steep incidence angles. As a result, key applications that require the use of pure HV, such as ship detection and wind-speed measurements, are significantly affected.

"reduced rank hybrid target detectors for maritime environments","2022","In airborne radar, reduced rank adaptive techniques are employed when non-stationarity and non-homogeneity of the clutter causes insufficient sample support. Approaches to combat this problem include the single data set algorithms and reduced-rank detectors such as those employing the principal components, cross-spectral metric and the multistage Wiener filter (MWF). This latter approach is superior to other reduced rank techniques in terms of computational efficiency, sample support and rank requirements. Hybrid detectors that combine the traditional and single data set detectors have been shown to work effectively in homogeneous environments while maintaining their robustness to heterogeneous clutter. In this paper we combine the hybrid detection approaches with the MWF to develop hybrid reduced rank algorithms that are capable of bringing the improved performance of the hybrid framework to bear on the low sample support environments. We evaluate the proposed detectors using simulated sea clutter data, showing detection performance that is superior to conventional and other hybrid detectors in low sample support spiky clutter environments while maintaining excellent performance in homogeneous clutter.","airborne radar,marine radar,reduced rank techniques,single data,radar detection,radar clutter,hybrid detectors,homogeneous clutter,sea clutter data,MWF,low sample support environments,hybrid reduced rank algorithms,multistage Wiener filter,heterogeneous clutter,reduced-rank detectors,homogeneous environments,maritime environments,rank requirements,hybrid detection approaches,reduced rank hybrid target detectors,low sample support spiky clutter environments,reduced rank adaptive techniques,Wiener filters,"
"supervised classification for hyperspectral imaging in uav maritime target detection","2018","This paper addresses the use of a hyperspectral image system to detect vessels in maritime operational scenarios. The developed hyperspectral imaging classification methods are based on supervised approaches and allow to detect the presence of vessels using real hyperspectral data. We implemented two different methods for comparison purposes: SVM and SAM. The SVM method, which can be considered one of most utilized methods for image classification, was implemented using linear, RBF, sigmoid and polynomial kernels with PCA for dimensionality reduction, and compared with SAM using a two classes definition, namely vessel and water. The obtained results using real data collected from a UAV allow to conclude that the SVM approach is suitable for detecting the vessel presence in the water with a precision and recall rates favorable when compared to SAM.","Kernel,Support vector machines,PCA,vessel presence,Hyperspectral imaging,maritime operational scenarios,UAV maritime target detection,hyperspectral imaging classification methods,geophysical image processing,supervised classification,support vector machines,object detection,image classification,autonomous aerial vehicles,Training,Unmanned aerial vehicles,hyperspectral image system,SAM,Tuning,SVM method,SVM approach,principal component analysis,radial basis function networks,hyperspectral data,"
"analysis and design of cubesat constellation for the mediterranean south costal monitoring against illegal immigration","2018","Costal monitoring is focused on fast response to illegal immigration and illegal ship traffic. Especially, the illegal ship traffic has been present in media since April 2015, as the number of reported deaths of immigrants crossing the Mediterranean significantly increased. Satellite images provide a possibility to at least partially control both types of events. This paper defines the principal criteria to select the best satellite constellation architecture for maritime and coastal monitoring, filling the gaps of imagery techniques in term of real-time control. The primary purpose of a constellation is to obtain global measurement improving the temporal resolution. The small size and low-cost are the main factors, which make CubeSats ideal for use in constellations. We propose a constellation of 9 Cubesats distributed evenly in 3 different planes. This reduces the revisit time enhancing the coverage duration. In addition, it also allows observing fire, damage on building and similar disasters. In this analysis, the performance criteria were reported such as the revisit time, the vision duration and the area coverage.","Revisit time,CubeSat,Constellation,Coverage,"

"adaptive detection tracking system for autonomous uav maritime patrolling","2020","Nowadays, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are considered reliable systems, suitable for several autonomous applications, especially for target detection and tracking. Although significant developments were achieved in object detection systems over the last decades using the deep learning technique known as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), there are still research gaps in this area. In this paper, we present a new object detection-tracking algorithm that can be used on low power consuming processing boards. In particular, we analysed a specific application scenario in which a UAV patrols coastlines and autonomously classifies different kind of marine objects. Current state of the art solutions propose centralised architectures or flying systems with human in the loop, making the whole system poorly efficient and not scalable. On the contrary, applying a Deep Learning detection system that runs on commercial Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) makes UAVs potentially more efficient than humans (especially for dull tasks like coastline patrolling) and the whole system becomes easily scalable because each UAV can fly independently and the Ground Control Station does not represent a bottleneck. To deal with this task, a database consisting of more than 115000 images was created to train and test several CNN architectures. Furthermore, an adaptive detection-tracking algorithm was introduced to make the whole system faster by optimizing the balancing between detecting new objects and tracking existing targets. The proposed solution is based on the measure of the tracking confidence and the frame similarity, by means of the Structural SIMilarity (SSIM) index, computed both globally and locally. Finally, the developed algorithms were tested on a realistic scenario by means of a UAV test-bed.","unmanned aerial vehicles,coastline patrolling,target detection,robot vision,adaptive detection tracking,Machine learning,Feature extraction,target tracking,service robots,object detection tracking,CNN,deep learning detection system,graphics processing units,Target tracking,object detection,pinhole camera model,image classification,autonomous UAV maritime patrolling,neural net architecture,convolutional neural nets,autonomous aerial vehicles,convolutional neural networks,Training,Convolutional neural networks,Unmanned aerial vehicles,CNN architectures,Detection-Tracking System,structural similarity index,autonomous classification,learning (artificial intelligence),Detectors,UAV,"
"segmentation and classification of man-made maritime objects in terrasar-x images","2011","Spaceborne monitoring of wide maritime areas can be suit able for many applications such as tracking of ship traffic, surveillance of fishery zones, or detecting criminal activities. We present novel approaches for segmentation and classification of man-made objects in TerraSAR-X images including estimation of orientation and size. This is a difficult task as detections are affected by clutter and noise effects, and each object can have different appearances. We chose a statistical approach to robustly segment given detections using Local Binary Pattern (LBP) and Histograms of Oriented Gradients (HOG). This is the fundament for subsequent feature analysis and 3-stage-classification based on Support Vector Machines (SVM) with separation of clutter and man-made objects in first, non-ships and ships in second, and different ship structure types in third stage.

"are object detection assessment criteria ready for maritime computer vision?","2020","Maritime vessels equipped with visible and infrared cameras can complement other conventional sensors for object detection. However, application of computer vision techniques in maritime domain received attention only recently. The maritime environment offers its own unique requirements and challenges. Assessment of the quality of detections is a fundamental need in computer vision. However, the conventional assessment metrics suitable for usual object detection are deficient in the maritime setting. Thus, a large body of related work in computer vision appears inapplicable to the maritime setting at the first sight. We discuss the problem of defining assessment metrics suitable for maritime computer vision. We consider new bottom edge proximity metrics as assessment metrics for maritime computer vision. These metrics indicate that existing computer vision approaches are indeed promising for maritime computer vision and can play a foundational role in the emerging field of maritime computer vision.","Image edge detection,visible cameras,bottom edge proximity metrics,infrared cameras,Marine vehicles,maritime computer vision,maritime vessels,assessment metrics,Intelligent vehicles,Performance evaluation,marine engineering,cameras,computer vision,object detection,intelligent vehicles,Artificial intelligence,infrared imaging,maritime setting,Object detection,Sensors,object detection assessment criteria,marine vehicles,Computer vision,performance evaluation,"
"attacking (and defending) the maritime radar system","2023","The operation of radar equipment is one of the key facilities navigators use to gather situational awareness about their surroundings. With an ever-increasing need for always-running logistics and tighter shipping schedules, operators rely more on computerized instruments and their indications. As a result, modern ships have become complex cyber-physical systems in which sensors and computers constantly communicate and coordinate. In this work, we discuss novel threats related to the radar system, one of a shipâ€™s most security-sensitive components. In detail, we first discuss some new attacks capable of compromising the integrity of data displayed on a radar system, with potentially catastrophic impacts on the crewâ€™s situational awareness or safety. Then, we present a detection system to highlight anomalies in the radar video feed, requiring no modifications to the target ship configuration. Finally, we stimulate our detection system by performing the attacks inside a simulated environment.

"recognition of maritime objects based on flir images using the method of eigenimages","2018","The paper presents the method of recognition of marine objects based on their images taken by infrared sensors (FLIR - forward looking infrared) using the method of eigenimages analysis. This method is based on the principal component analysis (PCA) method that allows to reduce the dimensionality of the problem of image recognition. The paper presents a method of maritime objects recognition based on FLIR images consisting of the following stages: pre-processing of images from the pattern database, calculation of coordinates of images from the pattern database in a new reduced feature space, calculation of coordinates of image cluster centers, pre-processing of a new image, calculation of coordinates of a new image in the reduced feature space, calculation of the distances of the recognized image from all the image cluster centers in the pattern database and making a decision on choosing the most similar maritime object, or stating that there is no image satisfying the similarity condition in the pattern database. The combination of the principal component analysis (PCA) method with the method of eigenimages analysis reduces the dimensionality of the recognition problem. The original dimension is equal to the number of pixels in each image. It must be equal for all the images from pattern database and the image being recognized. The final value of the problem dimension is equal to the number of image clusters in the pattern database. In some situations, the dimensionality of the problem can be reduced due to the low eigenvalues of the matrix of Karhunen-Loeve transformation.

"doppler estimation for dvb-t based passive radar systems on moving maritime platforms","2015","PR (Passive Radar) systems using digital broadcasting services such as DVB-T (Digital Versatile Broadcasting - Terrestrial) transmission as illuminators represent surveillance solutions which have rapidly evolved and matured over recent years. PR systems typically use coherent integration time in the order of a few hundred milliseconds to acquire enough dynamic for the detection of moving objects. This is done under the assumption that both the illuminator of opportunity and the receiver stay static during this time period. However, advances in miniaturization of high performing computers and data storage devices allowed the design of PR systems that are compact enough to be operated onboard of moving platforms such as cars [1] and airplanes [2], [3]. Deploying PR systems on maritime platforms could enable covert surveillance of small land or sea based targets in littoral environment. A receiver mounted on such a platform may be subjected to highly non-linear motions. In this case a reference signal generated under the assumption of a static scenario may de-correlate from measured Doppler shifted surveillance channel and consequently degrade the PR systems detection performance. Compensation of these detrimental effects requires highly sampled and accurate measurements of the vessels Doppler shift with respect to the transmitter. To study these effects a two channel PR system for DVB-T broadcast reception has been deployed on a small boat to acquire platform motion data in a littoral environment. Based on the data gathered in this trial, a robust method for the Doppler estimation was developed, which uses the DVB-T standards OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing) signal features. The validity of this approach is verified with data gathered simultaneously from onboard IMU (Internal Motion Units) data.","marine radar,maritime platforms,digital broadcasting services,internal motion units data,passive radar,littoral environment,signal features,Transmitters,Doppler shifted surveillance channel,orthogonal frequency division multiplexing,IMU,OFDM modulation,reference signal generation,OFDM,nonlinear motions,object detection,Digital video broadcasting,radar receivers,Doppler effect,radar transmitters,transmitter,data storage devices,PR systems detection performance,Clocks,Doppler radar,digital versatile broadcasting terrestrial transmission,Passive radar,Receivers,Doppler estimation,DVB-T based passive radar systems,receiver,"
"towards low-visibility enhancement in maritime video surveillance: an efficient and effective multi-deep neural network","2021","Limited by insufficient illumination, the images collected by maritime imaging devices often suffer from low brightness, low contrast, low signal-to-noise ratio, severe information loss, and so on. The above problems restrict the development of maritime- related work such as intelligent supervision, collision warning, accident investigation, etc. To improve the imaging quality of maritime video images, we propose an efficient and effective multi-deep neural network (termed EEMNN) for low-visibility enhancement. In particular, we fuse the multi-scale information extracted from the encoder-decoder module using the dense blocks (DBs) and attention blocks (ABs). It is capable of enhancing the fused information leading to preserving the edges, textures, and other fine details. To prevent the overexposure of enhanced images, we fuse and reconstruct the output features of DBs and ABs with the raw low-light image to get the final enhanced image through two residual blocks (RBs). The mixing of multiple network modules can effectively improve the generalization ability and robustness of our network. Through extensive experiments, EEMNN has higher objective evaluation indicators, more efficient enhancement, more natural maritime scenes, and stronger detail-preservation capabilities compared with other enhancement methods.","efficient and effective multideep neural network,natural maritime scenes,image denoising,Lighting,deep learning (artificial intelligence),Feature extraction,low-visibility enhancement,image enhancement,Neural networks,encoder-decoder module,insufficient illumination,attention blocks,dense blocks,information fusion,image colour analysis,ABs,residual blocks,image fusion,maritime video images,low-light image,object detection,intelligent supervision,feature extraction,image texture,multiple network modules,Video surveillance,stronger detail-preservation capabilities,video signal processing,Robustness,marine engineering computing,Fuses,DBs,Imaging,video surveillance,multiscale information,maritime imaging devices,maritime video surveillance,"

"mesoscale modeling of smoke transport over the southeast asian maritime continent: interplay of sea breeze, trade wind, typhoon, and topography","2013","The online-coupled Weather Research and Forecasting model with Chemistry (WRFchem) is used to simulate the transport of smoke particles over the Southeast Asian Maritime Continent during September–October 2006. In this period, dry conditions associated with the moderate El Niño event caused the largest regional biomass burning outbreak since 1997. Smoke emission in WRFchem is specified according to the Fire Locating and Modeling of Burning Emissions (FLAMBE) database derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) fire products. The modeled smoke transport pathway is found to be consistent with the MODIS true color images and measured mass concentration of surface PM10 (particulate matter with diameter less than 10μm). The interplay of sea/land breezes, typhoons and storms over the subtropical western Pacific Ocean, trade winds, and topographic effects, can be clearly seen in the model simulation. The most severe smoke events in 1–5 October 2006 are found to be associated with the meteorological responses to the typhoon Xangsane (#18) over the western subtropical Pacific Ocean, which moved smoke from Sumatra eastward in the lower troposphere (below 700hPa), forming smoke layers mixed with and above the boundary layer clouds over Borneo. In contrast, the second largest week-long smoke transport event of 15–18 October 2006 was associated with the seasonal monsoonal transition period, during which smoke plumes were wide spread over the 5°S–5°N zone as a result of (a) the near surface divergence coupled with the 700hPa bifurcation of wind (flowing both to the west and to the east), and (b) the near-surface southeasterly and easterly winds along the equator transporting smoke from Borneo to Sumatra and Peninsular Malaysia. Analysis of data from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarisation (CALIOP) shows that smoke particles in October 2006 were primarily located within 3.5km above the surface. Smoke particles contributed roughly half of the total aerosol extinction retrieved by CALIOP. Results suggest that the smoke injection height in the model should be set lower than the 2–5km commonly used in transport simulations; smoke release at ~0.8km instead of 2km above surface gives a consistently better match to CALIOP observations. Numerical experiments further show that the Titiwangsa Mountains in Malaysia Peninsula and Tama Abu Mountains in Borneo have significant impacts on smoke transport and the surface air quality in the vicinity.","Sea breeze,Trade wind,Typhoon,Southeast Asian Maritime Continent,Smoke particles,"
"ais-based maritime anomaly traffic detection: a review","2023","Maritime transportation plays an essential role in global trade. Due to the huge number of vessels worldwide, there is also a non-negligible volume of Maritime incidents such as collisions/sinking and illegal events (e.g., piracy, smuggling, and unauthorized fishing). Electronic equipment/systems, such as radars and Automatic Identification Systems (AIS), have contributed to improving maritime situational awareness. AIS provides one of the fundamental sources of vessel kinematics and static data. Today, many approaches are focused on automatically detecting the vessels’ traffic behavior and discovering useful patterns and deviations from those data. These studies contribute to detecting suspicious activities and anomalous trajectories, whose developed techniques could be applied in the surveillance systems, helping the authorities to anticipate proper actions. Several concerns and difficulties are involved in the analyses of vessel kinematics data: how to deal with big data generated, inconsistencies, irregular updates, dynamic data, unlabeled data, and evaluation.

Multiple hypothesis testing suggests a framework to enlist reliable information from monitoring systems (coastal radars and space-born satellite sensors) in support of detection of anomalies, spoofing, and stealth deviations.

In this scenario, graphical representation techniques play a key role in helping to reveal seasonal structures of human made noises. Nevertheless, for very long temporal series, it might be challenging to find a graphic visualization technique that allows representing a time range that is long enough to capture these seasonal events, while at the same time preserving short isolated events. We propose a framework for the creation of such visualization techniques and analyze the different stages involved: data reduction, color encoding, and signal processing on graphs. All of this is applied to data from deployments in two marine protected areas in order to provide an acoustic panorama and identify seasonal events.","Submarine environment,Hough transform,Ambient noise characterization,Data reduction,Surveillance,Big data visualization,Acoustic images,"
"results from 3 seasons of surveys in maritime canada using the leica chiroptera ii shallow water topo-bathymetric lidar sensor","2017","The coastal zone is a challenging place to map, techniques for mapping the land cover and elevation do not work under water and methods for mapping the seabed cover and elevation work well in deep water but are dangerous and expensive in shallow water. As a result, detailed information in the shallow coastal zone is lacking. This presentation will focus on the Chiroptera II, a new shallow water topo-bathymetric lidar sensor that is designed to collect seamless elevation data from land to the submerged terrain under coastal or freshwater. The sensor is equipped with a 1064 nm laser capable of a laser scanning frequency up to 500 kHz and a 515 nm green laser capable of a scanning frequency of 35 kHz. The lasers pulses are directed to the surface using a palmer scanner that results in an elliptical scan pattern with a 14 degree forward and back scan angle and a 20 degree left and right scan angle. The NIR laser is used to map details on the land and to assist in defining the water surface, which is critical in order to compensate for the 515 nm laser beam diffraction angle and the change of speed from air to water, thus accurately positioning the reflected seabed return. In addition to collecting the elevation at high resolution ~ 1m and vertical precision ~ 15 cm, the intensity of the reflected green laser also provides insights into what is on the seabed. A 60 MPIX RCD30 camera capable of capturing NIR and RGB bands of imagery is co-aligned with the lidar sensor to provide additional data that can be directly georeferenced with a ca 5 cm resolution. Full waveforms of the green laser are recorded and used to calculate discrete points representing the water surface, objects in the water column and the seabed bathymetry. Standard point attributes include the x, y, z positioning, echo information and intensity or amplitude of the reflected signal. An empirical method has been developed to compensate for the exponential energy loss of the green laser energy with water depth. This method results in a â€œdepth normalizedâ€ seabed intensity image which provides details on the seabed cover materials. Tools have been built to calculate waveform metrics of the seabed return including: total area under the curve, skewness, kurtosis, the left and right distance and angle to the peak. These waveform metrics can then be used to construct grids representing the metrics which can be used for subsequent bottom cover classification. NSCC-AGRG has conducted topo-bathy lidar surveys throughout Maritime Canada for the past 3 years using this sensor. Since the sensor relies on the penetration of 515 nm light to detect the seabed, water clarity and the reflectivity of the seabed are constraints on the depth of penetration of the lidar. Coastal waters have variable turbidity, often dominated by wind induced wave action that suspends near shore sediments causing poor survey conditions. A turbidity management system has been designed that relies on meteorological forecasts and observed wind conditions as well as shoreline orientation along the coast to predict suitable periods for bathymetric lidar surveys. The turbidity management system will be presented as well as the results of several surveys. Various applications of these data will be presented including mapping submerged aquatic vegetation, providing input to hydrodynamic model simulations to support aquaculture site selection and improve oil spill preparedness, and shoreline sensitivity mapping.

"trajectory optimization for high-altitude long-endurance uav maritime radar surveillance","2020","For an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) carrying out a maritime radar surveillance mission, there is a tradeoff between maximizing information obtained from the search area and minimizing fuel consumption. This article presents an approach for the optimization of a UAV's trajectory for maritime radar wide area persistent surveillance to simultaneously minimize fuel consumption, maximize mean probability of detection, and minimize mean revisit time. Quintic polynomials are used to generate UAV trajectories due to their ability to provide complete and complex solutions while requiring few inputs. Furthermore, the UAV dynamics and surveillance mission requirements are used to ensure that a trajectory is realistic and mission compatible. A wide area search radar model is used within this article in conjunction with a discretized grid in order to determine the search area's mean probability of detection and mean revisit time. The trajectory generation method is then used in conjunction with a multiobjective particle swarm optimization algorithm to obtain a global optimum in terms of path, airspeed (and thus time), and altitude. The performance of the approach is then tested over two common maritime surveillance scenarios and compared to an industry recommended baseline.","surveillance,remote sensing,trajectory optimisation (aerospace),multiobjective optimization,Trajectory optimization,particle swarm optimisation,trajectory generation method,unmanned aerial vehicle,polynomials,aircraft control,robot dynamics,UAV dynamics,search radar,particle swarm optimization (PSO),Radar,high-altitude long-endurance UAV maritime radar surveillance,path planning,autonomous aerial vehicles,quintic polynomials,Airborne radar,trajectory optimization,Unmanned aerial vehicles,mobile robots,wide area search radar model,Surveillance,unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs),robot kinematics,Fuels,multiobjective particle swarm optimization algorithm,"

Previously, corridor analysis has been accomplished with innovative straight-line diagrams for land transportation but can be extended to evaluate disorganized corridors such as waterways. Attacks can originate from aerial, submerged, and surface origins with unique security risks associated with waterway channel geometry.

"textual risk mining for maritime situational awareness","2014","In this paper, we propose an auxiliary Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) integrated system for maritime situational awareness (MSA) operations. We bring into account a new and influential asset - human intuition and perception - to the existing semi-automated decision support systems that mostly rely on numerical data collected by electronic sensors or cameras located either directly on the vessels or in the maritime command-and-control centers. For our project, we gathered weekly textual reports spanning twelve months from the United States Worldwide Threats to Shipping Reports repository that belongs to the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), We considered the maritime incident reports written by human operators as a valuable and accessible unstructured textual input source in which a span of text1 is called â€œriskâ€ if it expresses one of the following kinds of vessel incidents: fired, robbed, boarded, hijacked, attacked, chased, approached, kidnapped, boarding attempted, suspiciously approached or clashed with. Our approach benefits from probability distributions of some useful features annotated based on a list of lexicons that contain expressions denoting vessel types, risks types, risk associates, maritime geographical locations, dates and times. These distributions are captured and used to anchor the span of â€œrisksâ€ as they are described in the textual reports. After some preprocessing steps that include tokenization, named entity extraction and part-of-speech tagging, the textual risk mining system applies a variety of sequence classification algorithms, e.g., Conditional Random Fields, Conditional Markov Models and Hidden Markov Models in order to compare the risk classification performance. Empirical results show that our NLP/ML-based system can extract variable-length risk spans from the textual reports with about 90% correctness.","Markov processes,decision support systems,hidden Markov models,statistical distributions,tokenization,Risk management,attacked vessel incident,human intuition,Hidden Markov models,maritime geographical locations,conditional Markov models,maritime domain awareness,maritime command-and-control centers,Feature extraction,natural language processing,chased vessel incident,entity extraction,variable-length risk span extraction,maritime incident reports,maritime situational awareness,sequence classification algorithms,conditional random fields,robbed vessel incident,electronic sensors,United States worldwide threats to shipping reports repository,maritime situational awareness operation,fired vessel incident,marine safety,National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency,marine engineering,boarded vessel incident,feature annotation,machine learning,semiautomated decision support systems,cameras,part-of-speech tagging,risk management,NLP/ML-based system,Classification algorithms,probability distributions,risks types,risk classification performance,textual risk mining system,weekly textual reports,auxiliary ML,auxiliary machine learning,hijacked vessel incident,command and control systems,vessels,human perception,vessel types,MSA operation,kidnapped vessel incident,risk associates,risk detection,NGA,text analysis,boarding attempted vessel incident,approached vessel incident,Data mining,learning (artificial intelligence),sequence-based classifiers,"
"joint registration and fusion of an infrared camera and scanning radar in a maritime context","2020","The number of nodes in sensor networks is continually increasing, and maintaining accurate track estimates inside their common surveillance region is a critical necessity. Modern sensor platforms are likely to carry a range of different sensor modalities, all providing data at differing rates, and with varying degrees of uncertainty. These factors complicate the fusion problem as multiple observation models are required, along with a dynamic prediction model. However, the problem is exacerbated when sensors are not registered correctly with respect to each other, i.e., if they are subject to a static or dynamic bias. In this case, measurements from different sensors may correspond to the same target, but do not correlate with each other when in the same Frame of Reference (FoR), which decreases track accuracy. This paper presents a method to jointly estimate the state of multiple targets in a surveillance region, and to correctly register a radar and an Infrared Search and Track (IRST) system onto the same FoR to perform sensor fusion. Previous work using this type of parent-offspring process has been successful when calibrating a pair of cameras, but has never been attempted on a heterogeneous sensor network, or in a maritime environment.

"spaceborne radar imaging of maritime moving targets with the cosmo-skymed sar system","2014","Advanced satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems, such as Cosmo-SkyMed (CSK), provide high-resolution images with reasonably short revisiting time, allowing for a number of applications in areas such as homeland security and maritime surveillance. Especially in the case of maritime surveillance, moving targets imaging represents a challenge for SAR systems as the complex target motions produce evident image defocusing. In this paper, we propose a complete processing chain that aims at detecting and imaging ship targets moving inside the imaged scene. In the proposed technique, moving targets are focused by using inverse SAR (ISAR) processing, which proves effective also in the case of target's complex motions. The implemented processing chain can be considered an innovative combination of well-established detection and ISAR imaging approaches. It is important to state that the proposed maritime ISAR mode for the CSK SAR system acts as an add-on system and, therefore, does not require any modification to the original CSK design. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated by processing archive images acquired by CSK in spotlight mode; moreover results obtained by using CSK images acquired ad hoc against a cooperative target are also provided in order to prove the validity of the overall chain also in presence of targets with small size.

"changes in maritime traffic patterns according to installation of floating lidar using spatial analysis","2023","Recently, with the development of marine space around the world, friction between maritime traffic and various marine activities is intensifying. In particular, different recommendations are being made for the buffer zone between offshore wind farms and maritime traffic, as the criteria vary significantly. In order to respond to these changes in marine space, conducted this study on the change of maritime traffic patterns before and after the installation of floating LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) in marine facilities and apply it to future changes in maritime traffic patterns. The maritime traffic data was based on Automatic Identification System (AIS) data, and it was targeted at cargo ships and tankers with regular traffic patterns. A trajectory and spatial analysis were performed based on the AIS in the marine space. As a result of analyzing the globally maritime traffic patterns targeting the location of the installation complex of LiDARs, it can be confirmed that the existing maritime traffic patterns change into three maritime traffic patterns. Furthermore, the study employed the Hausdorff-distance algorithm for clustering analysis, categorizing vessels with similar trajectories. This approach facilitated a locally analysis of the buffer zone associated with individual LiDAR, considering the length of the vessels. As a result, it was analyzed that each vessel navigated at different buffer zone depending on the size of the vessel, and it is possible for safe navigation and forecast the future maritime traffic patterns.","Traffic control,Maritime traffic,maritime traffic data,buffer zone,Marine vehicles,wind power plants,globally maritime traffic patterns,Laser radar,marine space,existing maritime traffic patterns change,ships,marine safety,marine engineering,Wind farms,marine facilities,Oceans,regular traffic patterns,pattern clustering,Artificial intelligence,offshore installations,optical radar,future maritime traffic patterns,telecommunication traffic,spatial analysis,automatic identification system (AIS),Analytical models,"
"high resolution isar imaging for maritime targets by encoder-decoder network combined with the time-frequency attention","2021","The Inverse Synthetic Aperture Radar (ISAR) imaging result of a rotating maritime target is usually defoculsing since the complex sea conditions may cause time-varying spin speed of targets.

The TFA module is utilized to extract the spectral lines of weak scatterers, further, the Encoder-Decoder network is designed to transform the low-resolution time-frequency refined by the TFA module to their high-resolution counterparts.

"uncertainty fusion based object recognition and tracking in maritime scenes using spatiotemporal active contours","2014","This article addresses the problem of near real time video analysis of a maritime scene using a (moving) airborne RGB video camera in the goal of detecting and eventually recognizing a target maritime vessel. This is a very challenging problem mainly due to the high level of uncertainty of a maritime scene including a dynamic and noisy background, camera's and target's motions, and broad variability of background's versus target's appearances. We propose an approach which attempts to combine several types of spatiotemporal uncertainty in a single probabilistic framework. This allows to achieve a likelihood ratio with respect to any possible spatiotemporal configuration of the 2D+T video volume. Using the MAP estimation criterion, such a problem can be recast as as an energy minimization problem that we solve efficiently using a spatiotemporal active contour approach.

The essential requirement for USV is safe when suffered an emergency during the task. However, it has been proved to be difficult as maritime traffic is becoming more and more complex. Consequently, path planning and collision avoidance of USV has become a hot research topic in recent year. This paper focuses on dynamic obstacle avoidance and path planning problem of USV based on the Ant Colony Algorithm (ACA) and the Clustering Algorithm (CA) to construct an auto-obstacle avoidance method which is suitable for the complicated maritime environment. In the improved ant colony-clustering algorithm proposed here, a suitable searching range is chosen automatically by using the clustering algorithm matched to different environmental complexities, which can make full use of the limited computing resources of the USV and improve the path planning performances firstly. Second, the dynamic searching path is regulated and smoothed by the maneuvering rules of USV and the smoothing mechanism respectively, which can effectively reduce the path length and the cumulative turning angle. Finally, a simulation example is provided to show that our proposed algorithm can find suitable searching range according to different obstacle distributions, as well as accomplish path planning with good self-adaptability.

However, maritime ship targets features such as multiscale, arbitrary direction, and dense arrangement, and their imaging is often influenced by factors such as sea fog and sea surface background. It is challenging for fast and accurate detection of remote sensing ships. We propose a new ship detection algorithm YOLO-remote sensing ship detection (YOLO-RSSD) based on YOLOv5, which effectively improves the accuracy of ship detection while ensuring detection speed. It is attributed to our proposed four optimization measures in this model. First, the K-means++ algorithm is introduced in the data preprocessing part to improve the clustering effect and obtain candidate box sizes suitable for multiscale ship dataset. Then, an improved bidirectional feature pyramid network structure is embedded in the feature fusion part to achieve cross-layer multiscale weighted feature fusion. Third, the original bounding box regression loss function is replaced with the EIoU loss, which is effective for accelerating the convergence and improving the regression accuracy of predicted boxes. Finally, a channel attention mechanism is introduced in the convolutional unit to enhance the model's ability to capture ship features. Experimental results show that the YOLO-RSSD model achieves a detection accuracy of 96.1% for remote sensing ships, which is 4.3% higher than the original YOLOv5 network.

"the fractal properties of sea clutter and their applications in maritime target detection","2013","This letter studies the fractal properties of sea clutter, mainly including the box-counting dimensions and multifractal spectra. Those properties of sea clutter with targets and sea clutter without targets are compared and found different, which enables us to develop methods to detect low-observable targets within sea clutter. An integral test is utilized to compare the multifractal spectra of sea clutter under different conditions. In practice, researchers can hardly get enough real data of variable signal-to-clutter ratio (SCR) to get systemic conclusions. Therefore, we construct new sea clutter series from real data with variable SCR.

"scale-adaptive multiple-obstacle tracking with occlusion handling in maritime scenes","2016","Scale adapting and occlusion handling are two important issues in visual tracking, but usually tricky for many algorithms to address them efficiently. In this paper, we propose a framework for multiple-obstacle tracking in maritime scenes with the aid of depth information, which renders the vital clue for scale adapting and occlusion handling. In the proposed framework, each detected obstacle is tracked by an independent tracker respectively, and the depth of an obstacle is obtained by computing the disparity between the obstacle centers in left and right rectified images. Thereafter, the bounding box scale of a tracked obstacle is adapted according to its linear relationship to the depth. When occlusion occurs, the occluded obstacle is terminated to track, and when it reappears, the same identity number before occluding is assigned to it to keep the tracking consistent. Experimental results on our own dataset demonstrate that the proposed approach performs superiorly to the state-of-the-art tracking method in terms of scale adapting and occlusion handling.","Stereo vision,remotely operated vehicles,robot vision,Cameras,obstacle tracker,scale-adaptive multiple-obstacle tracking,depth information,Vehicles,object tracking,Target tracking,Sea surface,visual tracking,Context,obstacle detection,maritime scenes,Boats,occlusion handling,marine vehicles,collision avoidance,multiple-obstacle tracking,"

"anomaly based sea-surface small target detection using k-nearest neighbor classification","2020","Sea-surface small target detection is always a difficult problem in high-resolution maritime ubiquitous radars for complex characteristics of sea clutter, weak target returns, and diversity of targets. Multiple features extracted from radar returns in different domains have ability but not enough to solely distinguish radar returns with target from sea clutter. Joint exploitation of multiple features becomes the key to improve detection performance. In this article, the K-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm and anomaly detection idea are cooperated to develop a novel sea-surface target detection method in the feature space spanned by the eight existing salient features. The detection is realized by the anomaly detection followed by a specially designed KNN-based classifier with a controllable false alarm rate. In the anomaly detection, a decision region is determined by the hyper-spherical coverage of the training set of sea clutter that is sufficient and ergodic in the feature space. The KNN-based classifier is designed based on the training sample set of sea clutter and the training sample set of simulated target returns plus sea clutter that is sufficient but nonergodic, by joint usage of feature weighting, neighbor weighting, and distance weighting. The novel method is validated by the two open and recognized IPIX and CSIR radar databases for sea-surface small target detection. The results show that it provides significant performance improvement in comparison with the existing multiple-feature-based detection methods, owing to the fact that the novel method avoids the dimension restriction and feature compression loss in the existing methods.","k-nearest neighbor algorithm,feature compression loss,IPIX radar databases,marine radar,high-resolution maritime ubiquitous radars,Anomaly detection,radar detection,radar clutter,KNN-based classifier design,anomaly based sea-surface,neighbor algorithm,Feature extraction,sea clutter,radar computing,anomaly detection idea,object detection,feature extraction,CSIR radar databases,weak target return simulation,K-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier with controllable false alarm rate,Radar clutter,feature weighting space,nearest neighbour methods,Training,sea-surface small target detection,Clutter,sea-surface target detection method,Object detection,Anomaly detection framework,multiple-feature-based detection methods,training sample set,Radar detection,"

"a real-time scene parsing network for autonomous maritime transportation","2023","On the sea, scene parsing, one of the most basic environmental perception methods for autonomous tasks, helps autonomous devices safely navigate and avoid obstacles. However, most of the existing methods lack real-time performance and have difficulty accurately detecting small obstacles and changeable textures. We, therefore, propose a real-time scene-parsing network for autonomous maritime transportation. Specifically, we first design a lightweight model framework and then explore three efficient loss functions, such that a balance between accuracy and real-time performance can be achieved. The first loss function is an obstacle-weighted loss, which improves the extraction of small obstacles by analyzing the distribution law of obstacles at sea. The second one is a detail loss, which optimizes the detail segmentation at complex contours by emphasizing edge features. The last one is an affinity loss, utilizing the context dependency between features to accurately detect reflections, ripples, and other changeable textures. In addition, a new maritime sense-parsing dataset called Greater Bay Area (GBA) dataset is proposed and made publicly available. We tested the proposed model on the GBA dataset and MaSTr1325 dataset, and the experimental results show that the proposed method achieves superior performance in both segmentation and speed, with mean intersection over union (mIOU) of 94.59% and an FPS of 39.44.","Decoding,autonomous tasks,autonomous devices,affinity loss,deep learning (artificial intelligence),obstacle-weighted loss,Greater Bay Area (GBA) dataset,real-time,maritime scene parsing,robot vision,marine navigation,Feature extraction,real-time scene-parsing network,Meteorology,basic environmental perception methods,object detection,feature extraction,efficient loss functions,real-time scene parsing network,neural net architecture,maritime sense-parsing dataset,Real-time systems,detail loss,Context prior (CP),obstacle weighted loss,autonomous maritime transportation,Training,loss function,unmanned surface vehicles,mobile robots,real-time performance,Navigation,Task analysis,image segmentation,collision avoidance,changeable textures,"

"intelligent edge-enabled efficient multi-source data fusion for autonomous surface vehicles in maritime internet of things","2022","With the rapid development of low-end Internet of Things (IoT) devices and shipborne sensors, efficient multi-source data fusion methods for autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) have recently attracted significant research interest in intelligent edge-enabled maritime applications. The data fusion capacity can enhance the situation awareness of ASVs, leading to improved efficacy and safety in ASV-empowered maritime IoT (MIoT). Both cameras and automatic identification system (AIS) equipment, which provide visual and positioning information, respectively, have become the commonly adopted cost-effective sensors. In this work, we first introduce a lightweight YOLOX-s network with transfer learning to accurately and robustly detect the moving vessels at different scales in real time. A data augmentation method is then proposed to promote its generalization ability. The detected vessels and synchronous AIS messages are finally fused to make full use of the multi-source sensing data, contributing to an augmented reality (AR)-based maritime navigation system at the shipborne intelligent edges. The AR system is able to superimpose both static and dynamic information from the collected AIS messages onto the video-captured images. It has the capacity of providing auxiliary information for early warning of navigation risks for ASVs in MIoT networks.

"efficient lidar-based object segmentation and mapping for maritime environments","2019","This paper proposes a method that utilizes a 3-D occupancy grid to efficiently map a large area while retaining simple representations of objects for path planning and provide spatial characteristics of objects, which may be used for object classification. To enable large-scale mapping of objects, a region around the unmanned surface vehicle (USV) is defined where a high density of LiDAR returns is expected, termed the visibility horizon. The polygon intersection between the visibility horizon and the newly detected objects is computed, as well as the polygon subtraction of the visibility horizon from the mapped list of polygons. The two polygon lists are then combined using a polygon union operation, with the objects retaining class designations. The result is a 2-D map that contains polygon representations of objects, where the object is described with a tunable number of vertices and may have an associated object class.

"radar detection of low-altitude targets in a maritime environment","1995","Results from a unique analytical and experimental effort to assess low-altitude, short-range, radar detection capabilities in an evaporation ducting environment are presented. Within the horizon, the duct may shift the location of the last interference null several kilometers in range, which may cause nondetection at ranges where detection is expected and detection at ranges where detection is not expected. In addition, the evaporation duct may reduce the signal strength at ranges near the last interference peak so that detection of low-altitude, small-size, targets may not be possible until the target is much closer. At ranges near and beyond the horizon, radar signal strength depends both on the surface layer and on the mixed layer. To accurately model propagation in this region, knowledge of both surface layer and upper air meteorology Is required. An empirical model to merge the surface layer with the mixed layer has been developed.

"trial results conducted by multiple canadian government agencies of the recent covert technology developped by tektrap to trace and track the integrity of maritime containers worldwide","2012","iCargo is an easy-to-install miniature covert electronic device combining GPS and door lock tracking with wireless and satellite communications to remotely track the status and position of maritime containers worldwide. A system of strategically placed readers combined with satellite or cellular communications and redundant technologies ensures that security breaches are detected early and reliably anywhere along the supply chain. iCargo provides a GPS trace of where a container has travelled and where the container might have been opened. Deviations from the expected itinerary in time and/or distance are detected and the container can be flagged for physical inspection. Such a system helps borders authorities to focus their energy on suspicious cargo with the overall impact of speeding the flow of all cargo. iCargo uses a patented technique to convert the metal structure of the container into an antenna thereby allowing it to be installed behind the rubber seal of the door in a truly covert fashion. Other technologies are visible from the exterior and vulnerable to tampering and damage during container handling. The location within the door gasket is ideal for monitoring the door open/close status as well as for acting as a communications gateway to optional internal sensors. There are approximately 7 million maritime containers entering/leaving North America every year. The interiors of such containers are rarely inspected. Such containers may include contraband, hazmats, weapons or illegal items that present an economic or security risk. Despite significant security improvements since Sept-11th, only 5% of the maritime containers go through physical inspection. The use of the iCargo mounted on a container at the point of departure will assist government authorities in making better decisions about which containers to inspect thereby speeding up the overall throughput of all containers. In today's lean economy, goods in transit do not contribute to economic growth but instead are added costs to customers and shippers. With rising fuel and transportation costs, delays at borders are becoming increasingly expensive. Early detection via the iCargo system will help to reduce these costs by not only helping to shorten inspection delays but by also allowing officials to focus their energy on suspicious cargo thereby improving border security.

"airborne moving target indication of ground and maritime targets with smartradar","2014","SmartRadar is a multi-channel radar technology demonstrator aimed for airborne and spaceborne ground surveillance and reconnaissance applications. SmartRadar (an acronym for Scalable Multipurpose Aerospace Radar Technology) is engineered by Airbus Defence and Space. An X-Band variant of SmartRadar applying a multi-channel active electronically scanned array antenna (AESA) was integrated into a wing mounted pod and EASA certified for world-wide operation on a Lear Jet 35 aircraft. Due to its flexible design SmartRadar allows the development and demonstration of various state of the art advanced radar modes such as imaging by means of High Resolution Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), or target detection by means of Ground Moving Target Indication (GMTI). Also Maritime Surveillance modes and target tracking are available. Already in 2011 the on-board processing of high resolution SAR images in near real-time was demonstrated. In 2012 and 2013 the space-time-adaptive processing (STAP) of three channel GMTI data in real-time and on-board the pod was shown successfully in several flight campaigns. Recently also the detection of maritime moving targets became a customer demanded mode. One of these modes is the so called Maritime MTI (MMTI) mode which is the equivalent of the GMTI mode, i.e. coherent processing and clutter suppression by means of STAP is applied. This paper gives some insight into the GMTI/MMTI mode and STAP processing relevant issues. Results of the flight trials in 2013 emphasize the sensor's capabilities. The SmartRadar Pod System is property of the German MOD (BAAINBw). The authors gratefully acknowledge BAAINBw for funding this work.","airborne radar,spaceborne ground surveillance,X-band variant,marine radar,customer demanded mode,high resolution synthetic aperture radar,radar detection,space-time-adaptive processing,Marine vehicles,clutter suppression,radar antennas,SmartRadar pod system,STAP,Lear Jet 35 aircraft,Sea measurements,multichannel active electronically scanned array antenna,GMTI,SAR,Synthetic aperture radar,coherent processing,SmartRadar,maritime MTI mode,target tracking,SmartRadar flexible design,three channel GMTI data,advanced radar modes,scalable multipurpose aerospace radar technology,object detection,synthetic aperture radar,reconnaissance applications,search radar,active antenna arrays,radar imaging,wing mounted pod,space-time adaptive processing,AESA,STAP processing,radar tracking,maritime moving target detection,ground targets,GMTI-MMTI mode,Clutter,Radar imaging,radar resolution,spaceborne radar,multichannel radar technology demonstrator,Spaceborne radar,maritime surveillance modes,MMTI,high resolution SAR image on-board processing,airborne moving target indication,airborne ground surveillance,"
"maritime field trial of a dual-band silicon integrated photonics-based radar","2022","This paper reports the development, the complete characterization, and the first outdoor field trial of a coherent dual-band photonics-based radar implemented through integrated photonic circuits. The dual band radar transceiver has been implemented on a silicon-on-insulator platform, and is capable of operating up to the Ku-band. It has been packaged and engineered on a printed circuit board for its use in a complete radar system. The electronic RF front-end in S- and X-bands and the digital baseband equipment have been developed in order to guarantee performance aligned with the state of the art of conventional radars. The developed apparatus has been characterized in S- and X-band in terms of sensitivity, linearity, phase noise, and conversion efficiency, both at chip and system level. The impact and issues related to the used fabrication platform and to the packaged approach have been analyzed. The outdoor field trial has been carried out in a relevant maritime environment close to the port of Livorno (Italy). First, X-band radar acquisitions of a complex maritime scene using a rotating antenna has allowed to verify the radar behavior by comparing the detected scene with official data provided by the automatic identification system mounted on the observed ships. A false alarm probability of 2Ã—10âˆ’5 has been demonstrated, aligned with radar state of the art.

"cooperative collision avoidance study of maritime autonomous surface ship","2021","Maritime Autonomous Surface Ships (MASS) with the advantage of advanced guidance, navigation, and control capabilities have attracted great attention in recent years. The MASS collect travelling information by the radar, camera, and Autonomous Identification System (AIS) with which it is equipped. Therefore, collision avoidance of MASS turns to be a cooperative and collaborative one by utilizing the interactive information efficiently and effectively. During the collision avoidance procedure of MASS, steering and deceleration are the common actions. In order to receive an efficient and reasonable steering angle and navigation time on the new course, a communication-based real time collaborative collision avoidance decision model is proposed. Firstly, a multi-level communication method is utilized to integrate dynamic information of surrounding vessels. Secondly, a real time collision risk analysis system for MASS is established based on fuzzy logic method. Finally, a collaborative collision avoidance decision system based on the PSO (Particle Swarm Optimization) algorithm is developed to find the optimal steering angle and sailing time on a new course. Comparative analysis about collision avoidance decision results are discussed in simulations.

"context-based multi-level information fusion for harbor surveillance","2015","Harbor surveillance is a critical and challenging part of maritime security procedures. Building a surveillance picture to support decision makers in detection of potential threats requires the integration of data and information coming from heterogeneous sources. Context plays a key role in achieving this task by providing expectations, constraints and additional information for inference about the items of interest. This paper proposes a fusion system for context-based situation and threat assessment with application to harbor surveillance. The architecture of the system is organized in two levels. The lowest level uses an ontological model to formally represent input data and to classify harbor objects and basic situations by deductive reasoning according to the harbor regulations. The higher level applies Belief-based Argumentation to evaluate the threat posed by suspicious vessels. The functioning of the system is illustrated with several examples that reproduce common harbor scenarios.","Maritime surveillance,Ontologies,Belief argumentation system,Context,Higher-level fusion,"

In the maritime domain, modern TDS is connected to various sensors such as Radar, Automatic Identification System (AIS), and Tactical Data Link Processor (TDLP) where each sensor usually has its independent tracking system. The tracks of each tracker must be associated and fused so that valid and reliable information about situational awareness appears in TDS. Each of the data generated by trackers has different characteristics and problems, which prompted many researchers to formulate algorithms suitable for track associations. In this paper, we present the results of our preliminary research regarding the track association to be used in maritime TDS. The results of the analysis from this study will then be used in further research that is more specific about the proposed track association method.","modern TDS,surveillance,tracker,track association,sensor fusion,telecommunication computing,reliable information,tactical data link processor,aircraft platform,maritime tactical data system,TDLP,valid information,target tracking,ship platform,software system,military computing,ships,automatic identification system,track fusion,tactical data system,radar,AIS,track association method,maritime domain,Radar tracking,Software systems,situational awareness,Radar,command and control systems,Training,maritime TDS,Navigation,Surveillance,independent tracking system,navigation,military communication,Technological innovation,"

Coherent distributed arrays, where the individual wireless systems synchronize at the level of the RF carrier phase, achieve transmit power gains on the order of the number of platforms squared, and receive gains proportional to the number of platforms. For radar applications, an array with N elements yields an overall system gain of N3 in the far field of the array, providing a significant improvement in radar sensitivity. This paper analyzes improved detection capabilities for surface maritime radars operating coherently, and discusses technologies for achieving coherent gain.

"a deep learning framework for enhancing maritime coastal security","2021","The concerns of coastal security are very dynamic which depends on several factors like the neighbourhood of the country, the terrain and the marine traffic. As in the present system, only the vessels which emit Automatic Identification System (AIS) data streams can be detected and identified. Small vessels like some boats do not have AIS system setup, so they can get past without getting detected. Therefore, we propose a solution by framing a deep learning architecture namely faster region based convolutional neural network (Faster R-CNN) which accurately detects vessels in satellite images and outputs the latitude and longitude coordinates which when merged with AIS data helps identify whether the vessel is registered or not. Along with this, our paper also focuses on threat level detections from the unregistered vessels to analyze any terrorizing activity that may occur along the coastline.","Satellites,Faster Region Based Convolutional Neural Network,deep learning (artificial intelligence),maritime coastal security,Faster R-CNN,threat level detections,Sea measurements,marine safety,terrorism,marine engineering,Automatic Identification System,AIS,maritime surveillance,object detection,data streams,longitude coordinates,Haversine,neural net architecture,faster region based convolutional neural network,Real-time systems,latitude coordinates,convolutional neural nets,Tracking,terrorizing activity,Euclidian,Deep learning,Surveillance,deep learning architecture,vessel,Security,AIS data,"
"maritime route and vessel tracklet dataset for vessel-to-route association","2022","With an ever-increasing number of vessels at sea, the modelling, analysis and visualisation of maritime traffic are of paramount importance to support the monitoring tasks of maritime stakeholders. Sensors have been developed in this respect to track vessels and capture the maritime traffic at the global scale. The Automatic Identification System (AIS) is transmitting maritime positional and nominative information at highest frequency rate, making it a valuable source for maritime traffic modelling. From an original AIS dataset covering the area of Brest, France, we extracted a set of 17 maritime routes, connecting ports in this area. Two different representations for the routes are provided: (1) clusters of AIS contacts, and (2) route prototypes, representing the nominal trajectory of the vessels following the route. Additionally, a set of tracklets (built by five consecutive AIS contacts from the same vessel trajectory) has been extracted from the set of routes and the original dataset, and labelled either with the route name to which they belong or as off-route tracklets. This dataset provides thus some ground truth on the routes followed by vessels and is aimed at testing and validating vessel-to-route or track-to-route association algorithms.","Track-to-route association,Vessel-to-route association,Route prototypes,Maritime routes,Automatic identification system,"
"resource management of maritime edge nodes for collected data feedback","2020","With the development of marine economy, more marine applications emerge leading to more deployed sensors and more generated data. However, current marine Internet only provides low transmission rate constrained by limited communication resources and bad transmission environment. How to efficiently use these resources and guarantee quality-of-service (QoS) of applications need to be addressed. This paper proposes an online optimization resource management algorithm to improve the communication resource efficiency with guaranteed QoSs for different applications. This algorithm needs neither of the resource cost function nor QoS constraint function at the resource scheduling node. Furthermore, the gradient information, which is usually needed in learning strategies, is not required either. Instead, this algorithm performs resource management of both computation and communication resources in each time slot only based on the observation of the last time slot. With slot-by-slot resource allocation, the communication cost can be minimized to be suitable for maritime scenarios. In the meantime, a long-term delay constraint can be satisfied. Results show that the proposed algorithm achieves the goal of reducing communication cost while guaranteeing the delay-constraint of different applications. Although more computation resources will improve its performance, this algorithm still can obtain the minimized cost given a low computation resource.","Image edge detection,marine applications,guaranteed QoSs,long-term delay constraint,quality of service,Delays,time slot,online optimization resource management algorithm,Resource management,gradient information,telecommunication scheduling,resource scheduling node,communication cost minimization,Online resource management,resource cost function,Quality of service,learning strategies,data feedback,optimisation,communication resources,computation resources,low computation resource,communication resource efficiency,edge computing,marine economy,maritime edge nodes,collected data feedback,Bandwidth,quality-of-service,communication cost reduction,current marine Internet,low transmission rate,marine communication,Scheduling,slot-by-slot resource allocation,Internet,resource allocation,maritime communications,QoS constraint function,bad transmission environment,"

The RMP presents the relevant maritime information based on the process that involves detection, classification and assessment before they can be further distributed and actions taken. Croatia, as a maritime country and NATO member, is expected to maintain such capabilities. To this end, various tools have been developed or procured that form the backbone of today's operational information system.

The objective is to demonstrate capability for first-alert protection of a high-value port facility against asymmetric threats that intelligence sources indicate are arriving via watercraft. Battery-powered acoustic sensors are rapidly deployed at widely separated chokepoint locations in shallow 5-10 meter water. These sensors autonomously detect the passage of a maritime vessel and generate a contact report indicating time, location and heading of the target. Seaweb through-water acoustic communications delivers the contact report via a scalable wide-area underwater network including multiple acoustic repeater nodes and a radio/acoustic communications (Racom) gateway buoy. The Racom gateway telemeters the contact report via Iridium satellite communications to an ashore command center with low latency. The in situ acoustic detection is corroborated using shore-based video surveillance to classify the contact as friendly or actionable.","Racom,surveillance,maritime vessel,Iridium satellite communication,intracoastal waterway,seaweb through-water networked acoustic communication,high-value port facility,Repeaters,first-alert protection,maritime domain awareness,data fusion,Racom gateway telemeter,distance 5 m to 10 m,underwater passive acoustic directional sensor,marine safety,maritime surveillance,underwater acoustic telemetry,acoustic communications,battery-powered acoustic sensor,underwater acoustic communication,Acoustics,regional command center,scalable wide-area underwater network,Logic gates,autonomous processing,Acoustic sensors,operational adaptation,shore-based video surveillance,national security,radio-acoustic communication gateway buoy,Surveillance,in situ acoustic detection,Modems,acoustic transducers,military communication,underwater acoustic sensor,Seaweb,telesonar,multiple acoustic repeater node,"
"satellite-derived bathymetry for maritime archaeology: testing its effectiveness at two ancient harbours in the eastern mediterranean","2021","High-resolution bathymetry is an essential tool in maritime archaeology, often used for underwater prospection, imaging, palaeo-landscape reconstruction and change detection. The commonest acquisition method relies on shipborne acoustic systems (e.g. multibeam echosounder). However, most of the world’s seabed has not been surveyed using these methods. Derivation of bathymetry from high-resolution multispectral satellite imagery (Satellite-Derived Bathymetry: SDB) can redress this in shallow (<20–30 m depth) clear water. It can be derived empirically using depth control points, or independent of control data through physics-based approaches. Given global satellite coverage, it is applicable almost anywhere with suitable water conditions and is becoming increasingly widespread in the hydrographic survey community. However, archaeological application of SDB is almost totally un-investigated. This paper examines the utility of SDB for maritime archaeology through 2 case studies: the ancient harbours of Tyre (Lebanon) and Ras Ibn Hani (Syria). Tested data comprise 2 m-resolution physics-based commercial SDB and medium-resolution (10–30 m) SDB empirically derived from open access multispectral imagery (Landsat 8, Sentinel-2). SDB was assessed for its ability to detect submerged cultural features and landforms and as input into palaeo-geographic reconstructions. Tested SDB performed poorly for feature detection, but was better-suited to landform identification and palaeo-geographic reconstruction. SDB also has clear advantages: low cost, wide area coverage, speed and data availability. Disadvantages include variable accuracy, technical limitations (e.g. need for clear water) and approach-specific requirements (e.g. depth control points for empirical and complex modelling for physics-based approaches). For maritime archaeology, its current limitations means that it will not replace acoustics for prospection and imaging but it does have utility for submerged landscape investigation and reconstruction, particularly in areas which now only have no/poor bathymetric data.","Bathymetry,SDB,Submerged landscapes,Geoarchaeology,Shipwrecks,Satellite imagery,"

This can be achieved using multistatic GNSS acquisitions with multiple satellites and a single receiver, and applying multilateration techniques. For an experimental verification, the target localisation concept was applied to practical maritime measurement conducted with GNSS-based radar test bed and bistatic ranges of one target for two different satellites successfully gained.

"wavelet-based texture features for the classification of age classes in a maritime pine forest","2015","This letter evaluates the potential of wavelet-based texture modeling for the classification of stand age in a managed maritime pine forest using very high resolution panchromatic and multispectral PLEIADES data. A cross-validation approach based on stand age reference data is used to compare classification performances obtained from different multivariate models (multivariate Gaussian, spherically invariant random vector (SIRV)-based models, and Gaussian copulas) and from co-occurrence matrices. Results show that the multivariate modeling of the spatial dependence of wavelet coefficients (particularly when using the Gaussian SIRV model) outperforms the use of features derived from co-occurrence matrices. Simultaneously adding features representing the color dependence and leveling the dominant orientation in anisotropic forest stands enhances the classification performances. These results confirm the ability of such wavelet-based multivariate models to efficiently capture the textural properties of very high resolution forest data and open up perspectives for their use in the mapping of monospecific forest structure variables.","Gaussian copulas,image texture analysis,Vectors,image resolution,multispectral PLEIADES data,Spatial resolution,Feature extraction,Forest structure,Image color analysis,geophysical image processing,vegetation mapping,very high resolution,maritime pine forest,spherically invariant random vector-based model,wavelet,wavelet-based texture modeling,age classes,Data models,feature extraction,image classification,image texture,Gaussian processes,stand age reference data,multivariate Gaussian model,very high resolution panchromatic data,Vegetation,cooccurrence matrices,Computational modeling,"
"autonomous inspection of underwater structures","2015","In the future our resource on land will be over exploited. The exploration of new resources in the ocean is in progress. Mining will be done on the bottom of the sea. The sea is also a big source of renewable energy. Off shore wind parks and tide plants are built. Also, the major world trade is handled over sea routes and several big harbors. All this maritime facilities are getting older and there are effects like corrosion or malfunctions. In general, they need to be inspected frequently. For deep sea applications, security reasons and cost reduction autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) will be the first choice. The project “CView” addresses one of these inspection problems, the harbor inspection. But the algorithms, we present in this article can be adapted to many other inspection tasks. One of the main goals in this project is to find cracks or damaged areas at the underwater buildings or to observe critical sections under water with cost effective methods. The platform for developing the guidance algorithms for inspection is the AUV “SeaCat”. This underwater vehicle has a control software system with an user interface for mission planning, a mission control system, a precise navigation system, optimized motor control with an autopilot and sensors for obstacle detection and inspection. For obstacle and inspection target detection, a scanning sonar is used. The sonar images are automatically processed with edge detection and line extraction algorithms to get a simplified environment description, which is used by the guidance methods presented in this article. A pan–tilt enabled sensor head with camera, laser measurement and MBES (Multi Beam Echo Sounder) is used to inspect the detected objects. Additionally, these sensors provide distance information to the inspection object which can be used by the inspection guidance. This article presents methods for inspection using the online information from the vehicle sensors to guide the vehicle efficient and safely. It is also important to handle the interaction between mission planning and execution. During mission planning, the operator will define the type of the inspection object (wall, vessel, sluice, etc.). The algorithms we develop use the information from the mission planning and the online data from the vehicle sensors to guide the vehicle to get the optimal inspection results. Therefore, a precise distance control to the inspection object, collision avoidance and object recognition are needed.","AUV,Underwater,Inspection,Guidance,Autonomous,"
"patterns of fire activity over indonesia and malaysia from polar and geostationary satellite observations","2013","Biomass burning patterns over the Maritime Continent of Southeast Asia are examined using a new active fire detection product based on application of the Wildfire Automated Biomass Burning Algorithm (WF_ABBA) to data from the imagers on the MTSAT geostationary satellites operated by the Japanese space agency JAXA. Data from MTSAT-1R and MTSAT-2 covering 34months from September 2008 to July 2011 are examined for a study region consisting of Indonesia, Malaysia, and nearby environs. The spatial and temporal distributions of fires detected in the MTSAT WF_ABBA product are described and compared with active fire observations from MODIS MOD14 data. Land cover distributions for the two instruments are examined using a new 250m land cover product from the National University of Singapore. The two products show broadly similar patterns of fire activity, land cover distribution of fires, and pixel fire radiative power (FRP). However, the MTSAT WF_ABBA data differ from MOD14 in important ways. Relative to MODIS, the MTSAT WF_ABBA product has lower overall detection efficiency, but more fires detected due to more frequent looks, a greater relative fraction of fires in forest and a lower relative fraction of fires in open areas, and significantly higher single-pixel retrieved FRP. The differences in land cover distribution and FRP between the MTSAT and MODIS products are shown to be qualitatively consistent with expectations based on pixel size and diurnal sampling. The MTSAT WF_ABBA data are used to calculate coverage-corrected diurnal cycles of fire for different regions within the study area. These diurnal cycles are preliminary but demonstrate that the fraction of diurnal fire activity sampled by the two MODIS sensors varies significantly by region and vegetation type. Based on the results from comparison of the two fire products, a series of steps is outlined to account for some of the systematic biases in each of these satellite products in order to produce a successful merged fire detection product.","Remote sensing,Smoke,Biomass burning,Fire,"
"imitating radar operator decisions for maritime surveillance missions using bayesian networks","2019","This paper presents the use of Bayesian networks for learning decisions made by a human radar operator carrying out a maritime surveillance mission. By imitating the operator's decisions, a significant increase in the autonomy of a radar surveillance system can be achieved as well as potentially streamlining the qualification process. For maritime scenarios, current literature has only focused on using a Bayesian network (BN) for identification and assessment, and often assumes inputs from a generic surveillance sensor. Furthermore, in both the maritime surveillance and radar operations domain, there has been no investigation into using the operator's data in order to learn the decisions made throughout the mission. This paper uses a realtime radar simulation in order to obtain the scenario and radar information that would be observed by a human operator. In conjunction with a user interface, the simulation is further used to obtain operator decisions for a given mission with the maximum likelihood approach used to obtain the BN probabilities. The BN is then used in place of the operator for interfacing with the simulation in order to test the suitability of this method. Several typical scenarios are used to demonstrate the BN's operational ability relative to that of the operator. Additionally, the required data size for sufficient performance is investigated.","radar surveillance system,surveillance,Bayes methods,radar operations domain,belief networks,Bayesian networks,human radar operator,realtime radar simulation,maritime scenarios,radar operator decisions,target tracking,learning decisions,radar computing,machine learning,radar information,Graphical user interfaces,generic surveillance sensor,Radar tracking,Artificial intelligence,maritime surveillance mission,radar tracking,Airborne radar,probability,Bayesian network,Surveillance,Task analysis,imitation learning,learning (artificial intelligence),"

"towards a convolutional neural network model for classifying regional ship collision risk levels for waterway risk analysis","2020","Estimating the navigational risk of vessels operating in sea and waterway areas is important for waterway risk management and pollution preparedness and response planning. Existing methods relying on a model-informed expert judgment of ship-ship collision risk are of limited practical use because periodic risk monitoring is feasible only when this can be done without extensive use of organizational resources. To alleviate such limitations, this article presents a new approach based Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and image recognition to interpret and classify ship-ship collision risks in encounter scenarios. The specific aim of the article is to investigate whether a CNN-based model can quickly and accurately interpret images constructed based on data from the Automatic Identification System (AIS) in terms of collision risk. To test this, estimates derived from training data are compared to validation data. It is also investigated whether adding additional navigational information based on AIS data improves the model's predictive accuracy. A case study with data from the Baltic Sea area is implemented, where various model design alternatives are tested as a proof-of-concept. The main finding of this work is that a CNN-based approach can indeed meet the specified design requirements, suggesting that this is a fruitful direction for future work. Several issues requiring further research and developed are discussed, with the validity of the risk ratings underlying the image classification seen as the most significant conceptual challenge before a CNN-model can be put to practical use.","Image recognition,Maritime Safety,Convolutional Neural Network,Ship-ship collision,AIS data,Machine learning,"

"maritime moving target detection technique for passive bistatic radar with gnss transmitters","2017","The paper puts forward a moving target detection technique for passive bistatic radar systems based on GNSS signals for maritime surveillance applications. If from one hand navigation satellites are extremely attractive as opportunistic sources for passive radar due to their global coverage and the availability of multiple satellites, on the other hand they provide a restricted power budget. To strengthen the target energy sufficiently to allow its detection, observation time has to be increased up to several tens of seconds. This requires the need to develop innovative techniques able to deal with such long integration times. In this paper, a local plane-based maritime moving target detection (M-MTD) technique is proposed. Such a technique performs the integration of the received signal for a long integration time, properly taking into account the migration of the moving target during the entire dwell time. Moreover, it provides target detection in the local plane that represents the section of maritime area covered by the radar antenna. Since this plane is common to multiple transmitters, the proposed technique can be easily extended to the multistatic case, which is the bigger benefit in using GNSS sources. Simulated and experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed M-MTD technique to detect ship targets, not detectable with conventional MTD techniques, with the GNSS-based passive radar.","Satellites,marine radar,Radar antennas,radar detection,passive radar,M-MTD technique,radar antennas,marine navigation,Transmitters,received signal integration,satellite navigation,target energy,local plane-based maritime moving target detection technique,ship target detection,radar antenna,search radar,Doppler effect,restricted power budget,maritime surveillance applications,Passive radar,Object detection,spaceborne radar,passive bistatic radar system,GNSS transmitters,"
"beam scheduling of maritime multifunctional radar based on binary integration","2023","This study developed a radar resource management (RRM) framework for maritime multifunctional radar (MFR) that performs surveillance and tracking of unknown targets. The proposed scheme consists of two stages: target prioritization based on fuzzy logic and a beam scheduling approach that transmits surveillance beam and tracking beams for each target appropriately. The proposed beam scheduling scheme also takes into account the imperfect detection of targets in real situation. A conventional heuristic beam scheduling approach was modified to incorporate binary integration in radar theory into the RRM strategy. The resulting scheme efficiently handles the complicated beam scheduling problem by considering the target priority as well as the imperfect detection of targets of a real maritime MFR.

"maritime uav patrol tasks based on yolov4 object detection","2022","The search and rescue operations conducted by designated maritime patrol troops usually employ ships and helicopters in their search and rescue work at sea, making it a resource-intensive undertaking both in terms of patrolling equipment and trained personnel. Oftentimes, when the victims send an SOS or call for help, the rescue unit in question can easily obtain the ship's information but cannot access prevailing maritime images of the sea, thus hindering them from swiftly controlling the accident site as effectively. This work endeavors to address this deficiency and proposes an automated patrolling operation based on small UAVs and a diverse set of maritime search patterns corresponding to different sea areas. Maritime images are collected via a deep neural network-based UAV and promptly returned to the search and rescue system. The object detection model in this case is trained using extensive images of maritime accidents collected from the network. This object detection model based on the YOLOv4 framework is thus used in the timely detection of maritime accidents. Post detection, an alarm system is set up to classify the danger level of the targets and to trigger rescue operations corresponding to the level of danger, followed by an alarm message sent to the rescuers by Short Message Service (SMS).

First, we extract and analyze the data mode of dim small target and reconstruct them by Gaussian functions. In order to suppress noise and enhance the weak morphological features, we develop a 2D anisotropic Gaussian difference function to strengthen target's direction features. In addition, by combining the multi scale pyramid with directional filter bank(DFB), the filter can be orientation selectivity and scale selectivity. Finally, as a supplement, the target region is extracted by the adaptive threshold segmentation method, and the signal is accumulated and marked by a pipeline filter. Experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively strengthen the morphological feature of the target and weaken the noise of background, thereby improving the detection probability of the target.

"an enhanced lightweight convolutional neural network for ship detection in maritime surveillance system","2022","With the extensive application of artificial intelligence, ship detection from optical satellite remote sensing images using deep learning technology can significantly improve detection accuracy. However, the existing methods usually have complex models and huge computations, which makes them difficult to deploy on resource-constrained devices, such as satellites. To solve this problem, this article proposes an enhanced lightweight ship detection model called ShipDetectionNet to replace the standard convolution with improved convolution units. The improved convolution unit is implemented by applying depthwise separable convolution to replace standard convolution and further using the pointwise group convolution to replace the point convolution in depthwise separable convolution. In addition, the attention mechanism is incorporated into the convolution unit to ensure detection accuracy.

"framework for ship trajectory forecasting based on linear stationary models using automatic identification system","2022","Maritime surveillance is of utmost priority for a nation's security, and hence it's economy. For maritime awareness, coastal surveillance, and maritime activities in the Region of Interest (ROI) should be monitored. One of the ways to keep this in check is to restrain unwanted infiltration. Monitoring unwanted infiltration is feasible through vessel trajectory forecasting and anomaly detection in real time. Most solutions for trajectory predictions are available but require a huge amount of historical data, and high-power computing resources. Here, the requirement is developing a decision support framework consisting of both lite weight approaches for short-term predictions and deep learning-based techniques for long-term forecasting. This paper aims to find the suitability of Linear Stationary Models (LSM) like the Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average Model (ARIMA) for predicting and forecasting the Vessel Trajectory as means of lite weight short-term predictions. For this purpose, the Automatic Identification System (AIS) dataset of the U.S. West Coast is used. The significant effort was for data pre-processing to create a robust dataset for model training. An appropriate model after the model-selection process is used for trajectory forecasting. The model's accuracy is validated using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) performance indices for residual and forecast errors. A window generator model is integrated with the best-fitted ARIMA model for recursive real-time predictions, with varied sizes and visualization. The proposed time-series model provided a very high accuracy as the RMSE value for prediction and 48 hours forecast are 0.023 and 0.017, respectively.","Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average Model,Window Generator,Trajectory Forecast,Time Series Analysis,Automatic Identification System,Maritime Surveillance,"

"a real-time data-driven framework for the identification of steady states of marine machinery","2022","While maritime transportation is the primary means of long-haul transportation of goods to and from the EU, it continues to present a significant number of casualties and fatalities owing to damage to ship equipment; damage attributed to machinery failures during daily ship operations. Therefore, the implementation of state-of-the-art inspection and maintenance activities are of paramount importance to adequately ensure the proper functioning of systems. Accordingly, Internet of Ships paradigm has emerged to guarantee the interconnectivity of maritime objects. Such technology is still in its infancy, and thus several challenges need to be addressed. An example of which is data preparation, critical to ensure data quality while avoiding biased results in further analysis to enhance transportation operations. As part of developing a real-time intelligent system to assist with instant decision-making strategies that enhance ship and systems availability, operability, and profitability, a data-driven framework for the identification of steady states of marine machinery based on image generation and connected component analysis is proposed. The identification of such states is of preeminent importance, as non-operational states may adversely alter the results outlined. A case study of three diesel generators of a tanker ship is introduced to validate the developed framework. Results of this study demonstrated the outperformance of the proposed model in relation to the widely implemented clustering models k-means and GMMs with EM algorithm. As such, the proposed framework can adequately identify steady states appropriately to guarantee the detection of such states in real-time, whilst ensuring computational efficiency and model effectiveness.","Marine machinery,Maritime transportation,Connected component analysis,Smart maintenance,Markov chains,Steady states identification,"

"ship detection using sar and ais raw data for maritime surveillance","2016","This paper studies a maritime vessel detection method based on the fusion of data obtained from two different sensors, namely a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and an automatic identification system (AIS) embedded in a satellite. Contrary to most methods widely used in the literature, the present work proposes to jointly exploit information from SAR and AIS raw data in order to detect the absence or presence of a ship using a binary hypothesis testing problem. This detection problem is handled by a generalized likelihood ratio detector whose test statistics has a simple closed form expression. The distribution of the test statistics is derived under both hypotheses, allowing the corresponding receiver operational characteristics (ROCs) to be computed. The ROCs are then used to compare the detection performance obtained with different sensors showing the interest of combining information from AIS and radar.","Satellites,detection,sensor fusion,marine radar,ship detection,radar detection,Marine vehicles,data fusion,maritime vessel detection method,Synthetic aperture radar,ships,automatic identification system,maritime surveillance,synthetic aperture radar,search radar,binary hypothesis testing problem,Artificial intelligence,SAR raw data,test statistics,receiver operational characteristics,AIS raw data,automatic identification system (AIS),generalized likelihood ratio detector,synthetic aperture radar (SAR),Detectors,multi-sensor fusion,"
"detecting infrared maritime dark targets overwhelmed in sunlight interference by dissimilarity and saliency measure","2022","Efficient infrared (IR) maritime target detection in sunlight interference conditions (SICs) is a severe challenge task in maritime distress target search and rescue systems. To solve this problem, the main contribution of the letter effectively proposed a dissimilarity and saliency measure method. First, based on the different orientations feature between the target and the background, the suspected target patches are extracted by revised visual attention model (RVAM). Second, considering the nonlocal characteristics of the target, a novel nonlocal dissimilarity measure is proposed to achieve clutter suppression and target enhancement. Finally, since the intensity changes of target and background in continuous frames, the multiframe saliency measure method is applied to remove clutter noise with low intensity similar to the target shape. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is superior to the state-of-the-art methods concerning detection validity and robustness for IR maritime target detection in SIC.","sunlight interference conditions,maritime dark targets,Shape measurement,radar clutter,Feature extraction,rescue systems,Dissimilarity and saliency measure,object detection,Optical filters,Image segmentation,clutter,infrared imaging,suspected target patches,maritime distress target search,novel nonlocal dissimilarity measure,Clutter,severe challenge task,Object detection,multiframe saliency measure method,visual attention model (VAM),target shape,IR maritime target detection,infrared (IR) maritime target detection,Weight measurement,"
"hkpm: a hierarchical key-area perception model for hfswr maritime surveillance","2022","High-frequency surface wave radar (HFSWR) has become the cornerstone of maritime surveillance because of its low-cost maintenance and coverage of wide area. However, when it comes to the extraction of key areas, such as vessel-target detection and vessel-path tracking, the HFSWR signal is strongly interfered by clutters and noise, which makes maritime surveillance a challenging task. This article proposes a hierarchical key-area perception model for maritime surveillance harnessing range-Doppler (RD) image from HFSWR, Laplacian kernel, a linear classifier (LC), and a subnet-based multilayer representation learning framework (SMRLF). First, a weak LC with a Laplacian kernel is utilized to capture the plausible vessel regions (PVRs). Then, a novel SMRLF is proposed to localize the vessel targets from the PVRs. To handle the noise, a maximum correntropy criterion with variable centers (MCC-VC) is incorporated in the subnet-based learning model. A thorough experimental analysis on cross-domain samples from radar dataset to scene classification dataset shows that the proposed HKPM performs competitively. The model shows a superior performance over most of the state-of-the-art vessel-target detection algorithms with a vessel-target detection accuracy of 94%. The extended analysis on image classification problem proves that the proposed model has great adaptivity and scalability.","vessel-target detection accuracy,HKPM,Kernel,marine radar,subnet-based multilayer representation learning framework,Discrete wavelet transforms,radar clutter,plausible vessel regions,Laplacian kernel,range-Doppler (RD) image,vessel-path tracking,maritime surveillance harnessing RD image,hierarchical key-area perception model,image classification problem,radar computing,vessel-target detection algorithms,maximum correntropy criterion with variable centers,linear classifier,maritime surveillance,radar dataset,object detection,feature extraction,image classification,search radar,High-frequency surface wave radar (HFSWR),radar imaging,low-cost maintenance,Radar,SMRLF,maritime surveillance harnessing range-Doppler image,MCC-VC,Doppler radar,scene classification dataset,representation learning,Clutter,Radar imaging,HFSWR signal,Surveillance,Signal processing algorithms,learning (artificial intelligence),HFSWR maritime surveillance,high-frequency surface wave radar,"
"maritime vessel route extraction and automatic information system (ais) spoofing detection","2021","Automated Identification System (AIS) comprises of a global real-time network of maritime vessels, transmitters, and satellite or ground-station receivers, which are used to track and record time-stamped static (vessel-id, type, etc.) and dynamic (location, course, speed, etc.) information of all maritime vessels. Traditionally, this data feed has been used by vessel traffic services to avoid vessel collisions, however increasingly, marine researchers and data scientists have shown interest in developing algorithms on historical AIS data-dumps with diverse objectives such as estimating trends in global ocean-currents, maritime logistical planning, fishing fleet monitoring and enhancing maritime security. This paper aims to propose a novel shipping-route extraction algorithm to process historical AIS data (running into tens of gigabytes of daily data, from more than a hundred thousand maritime vessels), to effectively characterize global shipping route behaviour and capture its seasonal trends. This is done by formulating a sigmoid based turning waypoint identification, which does not solely depend on the change in the course of a vessel, derived from AIS message. The AIS data is further processed to excerpt the vesselâ€™s distance from the nearest port and nearest shore with resolution of about 1 km, which forms a handy metric for the identification of suspicious ports. Several other use cases are also explored, which include detecting various anomalies in individual vessel behaviour such as intentional or unintentional switching off AIS transmission, shipping-lane deviations, spoofing transmission messages. To tackle spoofing anomaly, various spoofing identification methods are discussed. A region-based spoofing identification algorithm is developed to identify spoofing points under multiple categories using a clustering algorithm. All the results are visualized through an open-source map overlay. The results contribute to a growing body of fast shipping route analysis algorithms.","Pattern recognition,fleet monitoring,Clustering algorithms,size 1.0 km,Folium,AIS transmission,ground-station receivers,historical AIS data-dumps,maritime vessels,Switches,security of data,maritime security,vessel behaviour,maritime logistical planning,Transmitters,global shipping route behaviour,Turning,logistics,ships,marine safety,Route Extraction,marine engineering,nearest port,Automatic Identification system,Port catalogue,vessel traffic services,automatic information system spoofing detection,Data Mining,shipping-route extraction algorithm,vessel collisions,Artificial intelligence,AIS message,maritime vessel route extraction,time-stamped static,data scientists,spoofing identification methods,AIS spoofing detection,Market research,DBSCAN Clustering Algorithm,fast shipping route analysis algorithms,Data mining,global ocean-currents,Python,nearest shore,marine researchers,"
"maritime precipitation distributions determined from airborne radar and multi-frequency radiometric measurements","1994","The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission, TRMM, satellite will carry the first rain measuring radar in space with microwave radiometers. To support the development of the TRMM, measurements from nadir viewing airborne radars and microwave radiometers were analyzed to develop algorithms to retrieve precipitation mass distributions. The present retrieval algorithm used a three layer model. In the lower layer, the algorithm used a modification of the Hitschfeld-Bordan radar equation to find the rain distribution. A cloud physics model was used to describe the melting process of the hydrometeors in the middle layer. The refractive indices of the melting and frozen hydrometeors were derived from Maxwell-Garnet theory applied to air and ice in the upper layer and air, ice and water mixtures in the melting layer. Spherical raindrops, spheres consisting of ice and air to represent graupel and hail, disks containing ice and air to represent snow dendrites and ice cylinders to represent needles at the cloud tops were assumed in the scattering computations. A backward Monte-Carlo radiative transfer model was applied to the horizontally and vertically inhomogeneous model clouds to compute the brightness temperatures that emerged from these clouds. The distributions of computed 10 GHz radar reflectivity factors, and brightness temperatures were optimized to the corresponding measurements by applying Marquardt's non-linear least squares minimization to precipitation model parameters. The algorithm yielded the distribution of the precipitation mass density along a flight path that passed over Typhoon Flo in 1990. The resulting model was validated by comparing the measured and the modeled distributions of the 35 GHz effective radar reflectivity factors and modeled and measured 192 GHz brightness temperatures.<>","airborne radar,three layer model,remote sensing,rain,spaceborne radar remote sensing,microwave radiometry,multi-frequency radiometry,algorithm,radar applications,EHF mm wave millimetric,Clouds,measurement technique,Radar measurements,Radiometers,SHF,Marquardt,rain rainfall,radiometry,marine atmosphere,Brightness temperature,Maxwell-Garnet theory,meteorological radar,Hitschfeld-Bordan radar equation,microwave measurement,Airborne radar,mass distribution,minimization,35 to 192 GHz,Rain,retrieval algorithm,spaceborne radar,tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission TRMM,Ice,Spaceborne radar,Microwave measurements,millimetre wave imaging,maritime precipitation distribution,remote sensing by radar,Reflectivity,atmospheric techniques,"

"maritime object detection with event-based cameras","2022","Event cameras differ from conventional frame-based cameras in that each individual pixel responds independently and asynchronously to brightness changes. Instead of absolute brightness measurements reported as entire frames at regular time intervals, data from event cameras come as a stream of spatially and temporally sparse brightness change events. Event cameras have several characteristics that are favorable to maritime computer vision tasks, including high dynamic range and high temporal resolution. In this work, we apply Asynet, a sparse convolutional neural network based object detection model, to maritime event data sets we collected in the field. To address the limited size of our data set, we propose fine-tuning from pretrained weights learned from the neuromorphic Caltech101 (N-Caltech101) data set and then using a combination of augmentation techniques drawn from traditional image-based computer vision as well as event-specific augmentations.

"visual attention analysis for critical operations in maritime collision avoidance","2022","The research on how to provide effective onboard decision support for surface ships, especially in critical operational scenes such as collision avoidance, has been triggered as a goal in recent years. From the authorsâ€™ perspective, to achieve this goal, it is crucial to comprehensively understand the operational logic and mechanism of the human navigators. In this paper, we use wearable eye tracker glasses to collect visual attention data from the navigators. The scene is established as a collision avoidance task in a strait water channel on a maritime simulator. By using the concept of critical operations, the whole sailing is divided into cruising and maneuvering time windows. The visual attention is analyzed in terms of the transition time/frequency and area of interest.

"first comparison of sentinel-1 and terrasar-x data in the framework of maritime targets detection: south italy case","2016","The Sentinel-1A is the first of two satellites that composes the Sentinel-1 radar mission. Both satellites operate a C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) system to give continuity to the European SAR program. SAR is a flexible sensor able to fulfil users/applications requirements in terms of resolution and coverage thanks to different operational modes and polarizations. With the in-orbit availability of very-high-resolution X-band SAR sensors, the Sentinel-1 satellites have been designed to achieve wide coverage at medium to high resolution. The interferometric wide swath (IWS) mode implemented with the terrain observation with progressive scan (TOPS) technique is the standard acquisition mode over European waters and land masses. IWS in dual-polarization (VV/VH) combination offers 250-km swath at 5 m Ã— 20 m (range Ã— azimuth) spatial resolution. These specifications are in line with the needs of the European Maritime and Security Agency (EMSA) for oil spill and ship detection applications included in the CleanSeaNet program. The main goals of this paper are: assessment of medium-to-high-resolution C-band Sentinel-1 data with very-high-resolution X-band TerraSAR-X data for maritime targets detection; synergetic use of multiplatforms satellite SAR data for target features extraction; evaluation of polarimetric target detectors for the available co-polarization and cross-polarization Sentinel-1A IWS VV/VH products.

"nonambiguous sar image formation of maritime targets using weighted sparse approach","2018","For a single-channel synthetic aperture radar (SAR), finite-pulse repetition frequency and nonideal antenna pattern cause azimuth ambiguities, i.e., ghosts in image domain. In this paper, a novel algorithm of locating processing weighted group lasso SAR image formation for maritime targets is proposed to effectively mitigate the ambiguities, which can work on a single-look complex SAR image. In the scheme, the ambiguous signal model using the conventional SAR focusing processor is first explicitly derived, showing the analytical expression of SAR image formulation. The weighted sparse group lasso algorithm is then employed to group-sparsely reconstruct the subimages of nonambiguous and ambiguous Doppler components. In particular, we introduce adaptively weighted sparsity constraint, obtained from a priori azimuth antenna pattern, and clutter clustering during sparse imaging. It should be emphasized that the proposed algorithm can effectively improve the azimuth resolution by coherently integrating the ambiguous signal components, which greatly helps the target detection and recognition in maritime surveillance.

"realistic extended target model for track before detect in maritime surveillance","2015","Traditional target tracking algorithms are generally fed a set of thresholded detections under the hypothesis that no more than one detection is generated by each single target. Improvements in modern radar systems have made possible to obtain high resolution data of the targets, making them occupy more than a single resolution cell, and have made necessary to use appropriate Extended Target Tracking (ETT) techniques, since the aforementioned hypothesis is no longer valid. However, these techniques do not often take into account the physical phenomena that are involved in the radar-sea-target system. This paper explores some of the effects involved in the transmission, propagation, backscattering and processing of the radar signal in a maritime environment, that have a crucial importance in ETT. A statistical model that considers the featured effects is developed and tested in a particle filter based Track before Detect (TbD) algorithm.

"convolutional neural network-based novel framework for ship recognition in poor visibility maritime surveillance videos","2023","Ship recognition is a central component of the information perception for smart ships. Traditionally, the ship recognition mission is completed by remote sensing or synthetic aperture radar (SAR) or manual calibration via maritime surveillance video. However, the difficulty arises in implementing the mission when it suffers the weather with a poor visibility. The recognition accuracy may deteriorate dramatically in such a hostile environment, especially in the heavy fog environment at sea when using conventional methods. In this case, we develop a novel framework for ship recognition based on a smart recognition system that relies on the dark channel defogging and the neural networks. First, a dark-channel defogging algorithm is utilized to remove the adverse impact of poor visibility on recognition. After that, three different neural networks are used to train the defogged images (Specifically: Faster-RCNN, SSD, YOLOv3). Finally, we present qualitative and quantitative analyses of three different neural network models.

"coprime synthetic aperture radar (copsar): a new acquisition mode for maritime surveillance","2015","In this paper, we propose a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) technique able, in the case of bright targets over a dark background, to reduce the amount of data to be stored and processed, and, at the same time, to increase the range swath, with no geometric resolution loss. Accordingly, the proposed approach can be usefully employed in ocean monitoring for ship detection. The technique consists of a new SAR acquisition mode and of very simple processing. It is based on the adaptation of the coprime array beamforming concept to the case of SAR systems: two interlaced sequences of pulses are transmitted, with two sub-Nyquist pulse repetition frequencies (PRFs) that are equal to the Nyquist PRF divided by two coprime integer numbers. Each sequence is separately processed via standard SAR processing, and the two final aliased images are combined in a very simple way to cancel aliasing. We call the proposed approach â€œcoprime SARâ€ (CopSAR). Three different implementations are proposed, and the effectiveness of the CopSAR concept is demonstrated by using both simulated and real SAR data. It turns out that the significant data amount reduction and the range swath increase are only paid with a reduction of the target-to-background ratio and with the presence of a (nonstringent) limit on ship azimuth size.","range swath,standard SAR processing,Antennas,coprime array beamforming concept,ship detection,CopSAR target-to-background ratio,SAR systems,Marine vehicles,coprime synthetic aperture radar,sub-Nyquist pulse repetition frequencies,Synthetic aperture radar,ocean monitoring,SAR technique,Standards,maritime surveillance,synthetic aperture radar,synthetic aperture radar (SAR),geometric resolution loss,CopSAR concept,maritime applications,SAR acquisition mode,Azimuth,Sensors,ship azimuth size,Coprime sampling,remote sensing by radar,Arrays,oceanographic techniques,"

Due to meteorological effects, much physical detail could be lost in Maritime VLC. Effects of changes in the particle size distributions and influences of different sources cannot easily be taken into account. To address this issue, this paper presents scattering spectrum analysis of sea fog particles and attenuation of maritime VLC channel systematically. Firstly, based on sea fog parameters, the scattering, extinction and phase functions of sea fog particles can be calculated by employing Mie theory. Furthermore, scattering analysis of sea fog particle swarm could be evaluated. Then transmission attenuation of wide spectrum white-LED is analyzed by utilizing revised Gamma distribution. According to the sensitivity of the receiver detector in visible light band, the change of white light transmission spectrum is weighted. At last, combined with the white LED spectrum collected by the experiment, simulations describe that spectrum changes of white LED are obtained after transmission for a certain distance.","visible light band,receiver detector,particle size,particle size distributions,scattering functions,Absorption,sea fog particles,light emitting diodes,Gamma distribution,antiEMI,Mie theory,scattering analysis,scattering attenuation,scatting,optical links,fog sea,meteorological effects,fog,signal transmission,Atmospheric modeling,Scattering,free-space optical communication,Attenuation,scattering spectrum analysis,extinction functions,light attenuation,maritime VLC channel,sea fog particle swarm,Particle swarm optimization,Mie scattering,Atmospheric measurements,sea fog attenuation analysis,electromagnetic interference,underwater optical wireless communication,maritime transmission,light transmission,white LED spectrum,white light transmission spectrum,sea fog parameters,wide spectrum white-LED,transmission attenuation,white-LED light source,phase functions,Light emitting diodes,wide spectrum,"
"regional scale assessment of submarine groundwater discharge in ireland combining medium resolution satellite imagery and geochemical tracing techniques","2012","This paper sets the foundation for the use of freely available Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) thermal infrared (TIR) imagery in a regional scale assessment of submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) to coastal waters. A comprehensive, tiered, three-step approach is proposed as the most effective and affordable means to determine the spatial extent and scale of SGD from coastal aquifers to the coastal margin. As the preliminary step, Sea Surface Temperature (SST) values derived from Landsat ETM+ TIR are used to successfully detect plumes of colder water eventually associated with SGD in close proximity to the shoreline. Subsequently, potential sites of SGD are linked to geological features on land acting as possible sources, by combining within a Geographical Information System (GIS), mapped temperature anomalies with ancillary on-shore spatial datasets describing bedrock geology including aquifer fault lines. Finally, nearshore surveys mapping the activity of 222Rn (radon) and salinity are carried out to verify the presence of SGD and provide a qualitative assessment of fresh groundwater inputs to the coastal zone. Practical application of the complete approach in the context of coastal zone management is illustrated through a case-study of the Republic of Ireland. As part of this study, over 30 previously unidentified links between aquifers on land and the sea are shown along the Irish coast, hence illustrating the tight coupling between coastal waters and groundwater inputs at an unprecedented spatial scale. The study demonstrates the potential of the combined applications of remote sensing methods and geochemical tracing techniques for a cost-effective regional-scale assessment of groundwater discharge to coastal waters.","Radon,Landsat ETM+,Submarine groundwater discharge,Salinity,Thermal remote sensing,Geochemical tracing,"

"keynote: multi-domain situational awareness - from the underwater to the space domain to improve maritime surveillance","2022","Modern surveillance systems require to integrate coherently all available sources of information to compose an operational picture that is as complete as possible. While in the past surveillance had suffered from a lack of data, current technology transformed the problem into one of an overabundance of information, leading to an extreme need for automated analysis. Indeed, current surveillance sensors generate volumes of data that would have been unthinkable only a few years ago. Therefore, all the processing, algorithm calibration, parameter tuning, etc., need to be executed as much automatically as possible. This also requires novel paradigms for algorithmic design. In this respect, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Data Fusion (DF) offer an unprecedented opportunity to strengthen the technological edge; however, the risk is to elevate, at the same time, the speed of the threats we face. Indeed, the surveillance task is complicated by the diversification of threats, whose nature and origin is most often unknown. AI and DF techniques have the potential to identify patterns emerging within these very large datasets, fused from a variety of sources and generated from monitoring wide areas on a day-to-day basis, and use the learned knowledge to anticipate the possible evolution(s) of the operational picture. The presentation will focus on both real-world scenarios and theoretical models, spanning from the underwater to the space domain, including the analysis of scenarios with heterogeneous surveillance sensors (such as radar, sonar and satellite).

Thus, this paper describes a novel deep learning based maritime situation awareness approach using high-definition video. Maritime object detection is achieved in three main steps. At first, a key region based tracking algorithm allows to, dynamically and parsimoniously, extract high-quality region proposals mainly focalized around rigid (i.e.; potential object) video locations. The latter are, further, fed into a Fast-RCNN for carrying out objectness detection and box regression. Finally, a mere box post-regression operation enables to extract maritime objects.

"treat noise as domain shift: noise feature disentanglement for underwater perception and maritime surveys in side-scan sonar images","2023","In underwater perception and maritime surveys, due to the scarcity of training data and perturbation of speckle noise, the detection performance of underwater objects in side-scan sonar (SSS) images is limited. To address these problems, we proposed a noise feature disentanglement YOLO (NFD-YOLO) by combining noise-agnostic features learning and attention mechanism. Firstly, we rethink the speckle noise by treating it as the domain shift between the training dataset and real-measured SSS images and build a domain generalization-based (DG-based) underwater object detection framework. Then, we extend YOLOv5 with a feature manipulation module, a noise-agnostic subnetwork, and an auxiliary noise-biased subnetwork for noise features disentanglement, more biases toward noise-agnostic features and less reliance on noise-biased features in underwater object detection, respectively. Finally, the ACmix attention module is introduced for a more powerful learning capacity and attention to the object areas based on a small dataset. According to the experiment results, the proposed NFD-YOLO achieved 75.1% mean average precision (mAP) in the test domain, which increased by 7.5% than YOLOv5, and 75.7% Â± 0.4% mAP and 77.5% Â± 1.6% mAP for different speckle noise distributions and transfer directions, respectively, which verified its generalization ability and robustness for speckle noise. Therefore, the proposed method can mitigate the effects of speckle noise and provides a new thought to address the speckle noise in underwater object detection with a small dataset, which is of significance and benefits for underwater perception and maritime surveys.","Training,Sonar,Detectors,speckle noise,Feature extraction,Sonar detection,underwater object detection,feature disentanglement,side-scan sonar,attention mechanism,Reverberation,domain generalization,Speckle,"
"relationships between safety culture aspects – a work process to enable interpretation","2014","Knowledge about the existing safety culture in a maritime organization such as in shipping companies or on board ships can enable the formulation of effective interventions to maintain and improve safety culture and safety in the organization. When assessing the safety culture, questionnaires developed for this purpose are often used. This paper proposes a work process that facilitates the analysis and interpretation of the relationships between safety culture aspects using questionnaire data. The work process includes the use of variable cluster analysis where the cluster solutions are presented in dendrograms. These were found to be an excellent way to visualize complex relationships in the quantitative data and to facilitate the understanding of the safety culture concept. Results are presented from applying the statistical process to safety culture data from six Swedish ships in international traffic. The visualized safety culture results can enable group discussions about safety on different organizational levels and can constitute an important input to the continuous improvement processes for safety and safety culture.","Maritime safety,Safety management,Safety culture,Cluster analysis,"
"a provisional climatology of cool-season convective lines in the uk","2013","A 7-year climatology of cool-season convective lines in the UK has been constructed using archived radar rainfall data. 103 lines meeting basic size, duration and intensity criteria were identified over the period September 2003 to February 2010. Of these, 87% occurred in association with frontal systems (mostly cold fronts). The remaining 13% occurred within polar-maritime air masses to the rear of frontal systems. Annual frequencies were highest over inland areas of southern and central England (5.0–7.5 events per 10,000km2, per year) and decreased markedly to the north (<1.0 events per 10,000km2, per year over north and west Scotland). Tornado and Storm Research Organisation (TORRO) tornado data revealed that 27.2% of lines produced at least one tornado. The environment of tornadic and non-tornadic lines was investigated by analysis of available observations, from which representative values of various environmental parameters were obtained. Tornadic lines were found to be associated with significantly larger pre-line surface-based CAPE, line-normal forward motion, cross-line horizontal wind veer, and cross-line temperature decrease. Furthermore, a tendency for tornadic lines to occur near the core, or under the left exit region, of mid-level jets was apparent.","Cold front,Tornado,Squall line,Line convection,Severe convection,TORRO,"

"a big data approach for fuel oil consumption estimation in the maritime industry","2022","Route optimization has been a research topic for many years in the maritime industry and it constitutes one of the key components to improving energy efficiency and sustainability in ship operations. This paper deals with the challenge of estimating Fuel Oil Consumption (FOC) in the context of Weather Routing (WR). Given a plethora of features collected from the vesselâ€™s Automatic Identification System (AIS) or on-board sensor installations, we examine how a predictive FOC scheme can be coupled with WR optimization algorithms in order to reduce the vesselâ€™s FOC, emissions, and the overall cost of a voyage. In order to handle the amount of data required for FOC prediction, we employ a streaming pipeline that harvests data in real-time from different sources and processes them appropriately for visualization, causal analysis, and forecasting purposes. In this direction, we first conduct an exploratory analysis to examine and unveil the importance and inter-association between the various variables related to sea-keeping and weather features, in order to utilize them effectively in the context of a FOC predictive scheme. Furthermore, we introduce a novel recurrent neural network architecture that approximates ideally the underlying function describing the features and the vesselâ€™s FOC by taking into account historical data, and we showcase the results.

"maritime targets velocity estimation in space-based passive multistatic radar using long integration times","2021","Target detection by means of space-based passive radar sensors generally requires the adoption of long integration time strategies to reinforce sufficiently the signal strength. These are usually based on the recovery of the target Doppler-rate to cope with the range and Doppler migration experienced over the long dwell considered. In this work, we put forward a Taylor-series approach that capitalizes on the set of bistatic Doppler-rates estimated in Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS)-based multistatic radar configurations to estimate the velocity of ship targets with increased accuracy with respect to conventional Doppler-based procedures. Both the cases of single-element and array receiver configurations have been considered. Theoretical and numerical results under different use cases show as leveraging on the long integration times adopted at the detection stage could significantly increase the accuracy of the estimated ship velocity components. Few experimental results are also provided, verifying the potentialities of the proposed approach in operative scenarios of practical interest for this technology.

"detecting sophisticated attacks in maritime environments using hybrid situational awareness","2019","In recent years, the growing emergence of digitalization and data explosion has altered the threat dynamics in the maritime sector. The interconnected Maritime Critical Infrastructures are highly attracted by cybercriminals, who are constantly evolving their tactics, committing complex, sophisticated attacks causing a tremendous impact to economic and social life. Such intrusions engage multi-vector, composite attacks exploiting existing vulnerabilities from both the physical and the cyber domain. Current risk assessment approaches and countermeasure strategies fail to gather an overview of the maritime physical and cyber threat landscape.

This model allows to generate a holistic picture of the security condition within Maritime Critical Infrastructures considering the potential cascading effects of such combined cyberphysical attacks.

"identification and tracking of maritime objects in near-infrared image sequences for collision avoidance","1999","This paper describes the continuing development of an image processing system for use on high-speed passenger ferries. The system automatically identifies objects in a maritime scene and uses the detected motion to alert a human observer to potential collision situations. Three integrated image-processing algorithms, namely an image preprocessor, a motion cue generator, and a target tracker, perform the identification and tracking of maritime objects. The pre-processing filters the image and applies a histogram technique to segment the sea from potential objects of interest. The segmented image is passed to the motion cue generator, which provides motion cues based on the differences between consecutive frames of segmented image data. The target tracker applies dynamic constraints on object motion to solve the correspondence problem, thus increasing the confidence that an identified object is a target.

"sarfish: space-based maritime surveillance using complex synthetic aperture radar imagery","2022","Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery is an essential part of maritime surveillance since it can operate in most weather conditions, day and night. Space-borne SAR especially can provide a large surveillance coverage in which both ground-range detected (GRD) imagery at a reduced resolution and single-look complex (SLC) imagery at a finer resolution of the same observation scene are available. Recently, a large, fully labeled, Sentinel-1 GRD based dataset, named xView3-SAR, was released to promote machine learning (ML) research in detection and classification of ships in order to assist with monitoring illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing activities. In this paper, the xView3-SAR's companion SLC dataset, called the SARFish, is introduced. The aim is to promote the use of SLC data for improving IUU fishing ship detection and classification. An ML-based algorithm using the combined GRD-SLC SAR data is presented as a base-line model for demonstration. The algorithm consists of a constant false-alarm rate (CFAR) detector whose false-alarm rate is reduced by a cascade of classifiers trained using the GRD data, followed by a ship classifier trained using the SLC data. Preliminary results suggest that despite not using multi-looks to reduce sea-clutter spikes, the use of SLC images does not degrade ship detection. Furthermore, a very modest improvement in ship classification is observed.11Under contract from Rheinmetall Defence Australia Pty Ltd, Adelaide, SA, Australia.","radio frequencies,classification,space-based maritime Surveillance,Marine vehicles,Machine learning,maritime vessels,maritime objects,Synthetic aperture radar,geophysical image processing,Meteorology,complex Synthetic Aperture Radar imagery,MS,visible frequencies,electro-optic imaging,single-look complex (SLC),synthetic aperture radar,Classification algorithms,radar imaging,Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR),Radar polarimetry,SARFish,sufficient spatial resolution,Australia,radar imaging category,Image resolution,ground-range detected (GRD),constant false-alarm rate (CFAR) detection,space-borne SAR imagery,Surveillance,imaging modalities,Spaceborne radar,remote sensing by radar,image coverage,machine learning (ML),image scene,"
"an unsupervised approach to automatic object extraction from a maritime video scene","2014","In this paper, an efficient unsupervised approach for extracting objects from maritime background using solely still video images is proposed. Its main idea is that maritime background (sea) has the main particularity of absorbing only hot light frequencies (red and green), while an object has not this property. Therefore if a timely vector of class features is considered, then two distinct statistical classes can be easily obtained in one maritime image, using an appropriate unsupervised two-class classification algorithm, and thus one can efficiently extract object from background. This is achieved by firstly partitioning a maritime image into equally-sized blocks, and constructing a 13-dimensional block-wise feature vector (regardless of block size) based on some observed statistics of light absorption in a block. The latter capture at the same time the characteristics (higher-order geometric moments) of the Fourier spectrum of RGB intensities in an image block, and its Shannon entropies. Both types of RGB information allow together generally to characterize well background versus object regions. Furthermore, a mere statistical test makes it possible to detect situations where there is no object in a maritime video scene but only sea.

"maritime surveillance with undersampled sar","2017","According to the minimum antenna area constraint, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems require a low-pulse repetition frequency (PRF) to image the wide swaths in ocean surface monitoring scenarios. However, the low PRF that is lower than the Doppler bandwidth will cause azimuth ambiguities. This letter proposes a novel method of mitigating azimuth ambiguities when using an undersampled SAR system for ship detection over the open sea. In this letter, the concept of range subspectra is adopted to misregister the azimuth ambiguity signals. In addition, a change detection method that uses a principal component analysis and k-means clustering is adopted to detect differences in the azimuth ambiguities between two range subspectra images in which the azimuth ambiguities are misregistered. By compensating for the ambiguities in the corresponding image, the ambiguities can be mitigated.

Reducing the risk of a ship accident is therefore vital to all socio-economic and environmental sectors. This paper presents a maritime data analytics platform for policy recommendation. The online tool focuses on extracting aggregated vessel risks using spatiotemporal analysis of multilayer information: vessel trajectories, vessel data, meteorological data, bathymetric/ hydrographic data as well as information regarding environmentally important areas (e.g. protected high-risk areas, etc.). The web interface enables user-friendly spatiotemporal queries at the front-end, while a series of data mining functionalities extracts aggregated statistics regarding: (a) marine risks and accident probabilities for particular areas (b) trajectories clustering information (c) general marine statistics (vessel types, etc.). Employing the above tool, if-then-scenarios can be constructed and resulting statistics and diagrams can provide essential arguments at maritime policy makers.","maritime data analytics platform,bathymetric-hydrographic data,if-then-scenarios,multilayer information:,Spatiotemporal phenomena,Greek islands,Marine vehicles,Monitoring,Aegean sea,spatiotemporal database,socio-economic sectors,vessel data,statistical analysis,maritime policy makers,data analysis,trajectories clustering information,marine safety,spatiotemporal analysis,marine engineering,Accidents,general marine statistics,marine risks,policy recommendation,pattern clustering,aggregated vessel risks,vessel trajectories,Black sea,bathymetry,narrow straits,accident probabilities,Histograms,Trajectory,meteorological data,Marine safety,high marine safety risk,user-friendly spatiotemporal queries,Data mining,environmental sectors,vessel trajectory visualization,query processing,"
"weather-aware object detection method for maritime surveillance systems","2023","The development of machine learning-based maritime object detection technology aims to assist ship operators in maritime surveillance. However, as maritime environments can be quite complex, developing object detection models that can handle these situations is a challenging research problem, particularly when dealing with adverse weather conditions like rain and haze. While prior research has attempted to remove weather noise and improve object detection models under various weather conditions, they are limited by computing resources and hard to adapt to the constantly changing weather conditions of maritime environments. Preventing performance degradation as weather conditions shift is a significant challenge in maritime surveillance systems. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a weather-aware object detection method, Weather-OD, that employs an on-board edge and on-shore cloud-based system for maritime surveillance. It employs specialized machine learning models for object detection, which can be dynamically selected based on the weather conditions to ensure highly accurate object detection with low latency at sea. Weather-OD continuously improves accuracy by periodically training the models with newly collected datasets during voyages, and efficiently manages the life cycle of multiple object detection models, taking into account the constraints of limited edge computing resources. In addition, Weather-OD uses synthetic image data with weather noise to supplement the training data under different weather conditions. We conducted an evaluation of our weather-aware object detection models using a maritime benchmark dataset, the Singapore Maritime Dataset. Our experimental results demonstrated the feasibility of our mechanism with weather classification and a significant improvement in the mean Average Precision (mAP) of maritime object detection in rainy and hazy conditions. Additionally, our approach enables the continuous improvement of object detection accuracy through model retraining with small datasets.","Edge cloud,Maritime surveillance,Weather-aware,Object detection,Adaptation,Model specialization,"

"comparison of detectability of ship wake components between c-band and x-band synthetic aperture radar sensors operating under different slant ranges","2023","The detectability of wake components is affected by influencing parameters, which can be categorized into ship properties, environmental conditions and image acquisition settings. The characteristics of influences of most influencing parameters on the detectability are established. However, a consequent investigation and systematization of influences regarding differences in settings of various SARs have not been published. In this study, data from four different SARs missions, namely TerraSAR–X (TSX), CosmoSkymed (CSK), Sentinel–1 (S1) and RADARSAT–2 (RS2), were collected and analyzed with focus on detectability of ship wake components. The sensors operate on different orbit altitudes and radar frequency bands: TSX and CSK work with X–Band, S1 and RS2 work with C–Band. Using methods from the field of Data Science, the detectability of wake components is modelled for each of the four sensors using machine leaning by the support vector machine (SVM) method. The created SVM-models are then compared in order to derive statements regarding relative detectability of individual wake components. A measure of detectability model’s uncertainty and an alternative analysis based on accumulated backscattering statistics is presented to support the derived statements. In conclusion, sensors with shorter slant ranges and X–Band in comparison to C–Band were found to be better suited for the detection of ship wakes. However, these characteristics only hold for wake components detectable due to the Bragg scattering mechanism, i.e. Kelvin wake arms and V-narrow wakes. No significant difference for near and far field of turbulent wakes is recognized.","Ship wake detection,Synthetic aperture radar,Maritime object detection,Detectability modelling,Machine learning,"

"3d radar - modeling virtual maritime environment for the static environment perception","2013","Electromagnetic propagation has been a subject of interest, mostly in applied physics research and atmospheric physics over many decades. Contributions have been more towards more theoretical rather than experimental. With the advancement of radar and laser technology and regular use in achieving military related objectives, electromagnetic wave propagation has now become a matter of interest to computer scientists. Today's military services have faced challenges of maintaining financial stability of training activities. Thus most of them focus into computational simulators can be used as a safe alternative in a cost beneficial manner. Considering field of military, radar simulators plays important role in simulations. This research focuses on simulating sea-born radar for 3D virtual maritime environment. Proposed approach takes the 3D environment as the input and maps the objects via electromagnetic wave properties. It captures the surrounding objects and gives the 2D visualization of the 3D environment as the end result. In the static environment perception both radar and environment are considered to be stagnant.

"detection of invalid ais messages using machine learning techniques","2022","Coastal nations monitor maritime activities in the interest of defence, security, and safety. This form of monitoring typically occurs at operations centers that visualize the maritime environment by creating a Recognized Maritime Picture (RMP) covering a particular area of interest. The creation of this picture changed drastically with the introduction of the Automatic Identification System (AIS). AIS messages are known to contain numerous types of errors and in April 2020 a unique error was found in the data stream. This error consisted of messages indicating the appearance of over 200 vessels in the North Atlantic taking part in a yacht race when in fact no race or physical ships existed. The following work explores the application of various machine learning (ML) techniques to help identify these types of fabricated AIS messages. Specific ML techniques were explored including: K-means clustering, Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Feed-Forward Neural Networks (FNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and One-Class Support Vector Machines (One-SVM). The results showed that DT, RF, and FNN best identified the fabricated AIS messages with F1 scores greater than 93 percent on the test data.","maritime domain awareness,AIS,automatic identification system,machine learning,"

"bayesian filtering for dynamic anomaly detection and tracking","2022","This article presents a Bayesian approach for sequential detection of anomalies in the motion of a target and joint tracking. The anomaly is modeled as a binary (on/off) switching unknown control input that goes into action (begins to exist, or â€œswitches onâ€) thereby modifying the object dynamics; and by ceasing its activity (becoming nonexistent, or â€œswitching offâ€) returns the dynamics to nominal. The developed Bayesian framework brings together random finite set (RFS) theory to represent the switching nature of the anomaly, and optimal joint input and state estimation to sequentially update a hybrid state that incorporates a random vector for the kinematic state and a Bernoulli RFS for the unknown control input. In addition, a closed-form solution, the Gaussian-mixture hybrid Bernoulli filter (GM-HBF), has been developed to provide a customized solution for dynamic anomaly detection in the maritime domain characterized by linear Gaussian target dynamics. Based on the Ornsteinâ€“Uhlenbeck dynamic model for vessels, where the evolution of the object velocity is governed by a piecewise mean-reverting stochastic process, the anomaly can be represented by a change in the long-run mean velocity (i.e., the unknown control input) from the nominal condition that forces the vessel to deviate from its standard route. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed GM-HBF in both simulated and real-world maritime surveillance applications and test its performance in the face of false measurements, detection uncertainty, and sensor data gaps.","developed Bayesian framework,surveillance,kinematic state,Mathematical models,Anomaly detection,Automatic identification system (AIS),Bayesian approach,random finite sets (RFSs),Bayesian filtering,Bayes methods,object dynamics,linear Gaussian target dynamics,Switches,Bernoulli filter,switching unknown control input,Radio frequency,target tracking,Aerodynamics,stochastic processes,filtering theory,radar,state estimation,detection uncertainty,Gaussian processes,Bernoulli RFS,Radar tracking,maritime anomaly detection,dynamic anomaly detection,joint input and state estimation (JISE),probability,Ornstein-Uhlenbeck dynamic model,GM-HBF,Gaussian-mixture hybrid Bernoulli filter,"
"red tide detection based on high spatial resolution broad band optical satellite data","2022","Red tide, one of the major ecological disasters in the world, exerts great impact on the marine environment. The ocean color satellite data with low spatial resolution and high spectral resolution is often used for red tide detection, but is insufficient for the fine-scale red tide detection due to its coarse spatial resolution. To address this problem, a new red tide detection method based on pseudo hue angle (PHA-RI) for high spatial resolution broad band satellite data is proposed in this paper. Different from the standard International Commission on Illumination (CIE) system, the false-color bands of near infrared (NIR), red and green are used to calculate the CIE tristimulus X, Y, Z, instead of the true-color bands of red, green and blue. With this method, the red tide can be easily differentiated from non-red tide water, and the distinction between red tide and non-red tide water is doubled compared to that of true-color bands composite. Experiment results show that the PHA-RI method can effectively detect red tide, with an averaged overall accuracy, F1-score and precision of 92%, 0.92 and 0.92 respectively. Compared with the traditional machine learning method support vector machine (SVM) and spectral index algorithm Gaofen-1 (GF-1) red tide detection index (GF-RI), the proposed algorithm has obvious advantages in red tide detection, especially for the strip distributed red tide. Besides, the proposed algorithm has good applicability, and it is proved to be suitable for the detection of red tides with different dominant species including Noctiluca scintillans, Skeletonema costatum and Heterosigma akashiide. Also, it is applicable to different broad band sensors, such as Chinese satellites GF-1 Wide Field of View (WFV), Haiyang 1D (HY-1D) Coastal Zone Imager (CZI), Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI). The application experiment indicates that the proposed algorithm is effective in red tide detection, and it can successfully detect fine-scale red tide events, which have not been detected by Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Aqua due to its coarse spatial resolution. The results also shows the advantages of high spatial resolution satellites in fine-scale red tide detection. This work provides a method for red tide detection using high spatial resolution broad band satellite data.","Pseudo hue angle,Detection method,Red tide,Remote sensing,Broad band sensor,"

"modern electro-optical imaging system for maritime surveillance applications","2010","Asymmetric attacks against maritime platforms often emerge suddenly, non-predictably and from civil environments.

"high-squint sar imaging of maritime ship targets","2022","High-squint synthetic aperture radar (HS-SAR) imaging technology greatly enhances the flexibility of SAR. However, the existing HS-SAR imaging algorithms are generally based on the assumption that the illuminated target is static during the synthetic aperture formation. As a consequence, the state-of-the-art algorithms are unable to focus on moving targets well, thus leading to displaced and blurred images of the targets. A maritime ship is a typical kind of moving target with complex noncooperative motion, which has received much attention. Thus, it is a difficult but valuable issue to study HS-SAR imaging of ship targets. In this work, the influence of ship translation and fluctuation is theoretically analyzed. On the basis of these analyses, the new conception of â€œthird range compression (TRC)â€ caused by ship translation is proposed, and the squint minimization (SM) operation is implemented for the compensation of TRC. Moreover, considering that the target Doppler parameters induced by ship fluctuation are related to its position, a novel method called WASH-CLEAN (watershed and CLEAN) is proposed to automatically focus ship scattering points with different swings.

"context-enhanced vessel prediction based on ornstein-uhlenbeck processes using historical ais traffic patterns: real-world experimental results","2014","Traffic route analysis and prediction are both essential for maritime security. Specifically, the prediction of a vessel position is useful to provide alerts about upcoming events (e.g., opportunities and threats). However, accurate prediction along a route in the maritime domain is a challenging task, due to the complex and dynamic nature of traffic patterns. This paper presents a vessel prediction method, based on the popular Ornstein-Uhlenbeck stochastic processes, whose parameters are estimated from historical patterns of life. The historical traffic routes are obtained by pre-processing Automatic Identification System (AIS) data via the CMRE tool called Traffic Route Extraction for Anomaly Detection (TREAD).

"wodis: water obstacle detection network based on image segmentation for autonomous surface vehicles in maritime environments","2021","A reliable obstacle detection system is crucial for autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) to realize fully autonomous navigation with no need of human intervention. However, the current detection methods have particular drawbacks, such as poor detection for small objects, low estimation accuracy caused by water surface reflection, and a high rate of false-positive on water-sky interference. Therefore, we propose a new encoder-decoder structured deep semantic segmentation network, which is a water obstacle detection network based on image segmentation (WODIS), to solve the abovementioned problems. The first design feature of WODIS utilizes the use of an encoder network to extract high-level data based on different sampling rates. In order to improve obstacle detection at sea-sky line areas, an attention refine module (ARM) activated by both global average pooling and max pooling to capture high-level information has been designed and integrated into WODIS. In addition, a feature fusion module (FFM) is introduced to help concatenate the multidimensional high-level features in the decoder network.

"autonomous mooring towards autonomous maritime navigation and offshore operations","2020","Bollard is a vital component of mooring system.

An algorithm that translates the segmented mask of bollard output from masked R-CNN along with bounding box and associated class probability to its corresponding edge coordinate and finally to the single reference point for efficient detection and classification of bollard towards autonomous mooring is presented. At first stage, Mask R-CNN framework is trained with custom built bollard. The model obtained from the training is inferred with real data resulting in instance segment of bollard. The segmented mask obtained contains relatively large amount of the data points representing the whole area of bollard, which typically is not desirable. In order to precisely localize the bollard with one reference co-ordinate, the proposed algorithm is applied to segmented mask. Firstly, it translates the segmented mask to only four co-ordinate points, where each point correspond to the edge of bollard. Further, from the edges, the reference point is estimated. This causes significant reduction in point of interest (POI) and has potential to reduce the error encountered during pose estimation of the bollard in 3D thus making the autonomous mooring more precise and accurate.","Image edge detection,object detection and classification,remotely operated vehicles,autonomous mooring,masked R-CNN,robot vision,Marine vehicles,bounding box,reference point,data points,Industrial electronics,bollard output,pose estimation,Instance segmentation,marine systems,ships,POI,Three-dimensional displays,mooring ropes,object detection,Pose estimation,point of interest,class probability,anchor point,co-ordinate points,offshore operations,Training,segmented mask,probability,autonomous maritime navigation,Navigation,image segmentation,Mask R-CNN,"
"a cnn-lstm network for augmenting target detection in real maritime wide area surveillance radar data","2020","Typical radar detectors exploit only a small proportion of the valuable information contained in radar reflections, i.e. magnitude and Doppler. A neural network-based approach for augmenting traditional radar detector structures using machine learning (ML) is proposed in this paper. Specifically, the network is designed to augment target detection in the field of maritime wide area surveillance for non-coherent data. A combination network consisting of a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract spatial features and a long short-term memory (LSTM) for extracting temporal patterns in the spatial features is proposed. The network augments the detector structure by blanking out regions of the frame which are classified as not containing a target, thus reducing false alarms. The network is tested on data containing four marine targets collected by a ground-based radar. The data set was chosen because it contains strong sea clutter returns.

"beyond visible light: usage of long wave infrared for object detection in maritime environment","2021","Autonomous navigation of land vehicles has come a long way owing to the advances in scene parsing capabilities enabled by deep learning. Maritime environment shows an equally great promise in such autonomy and research specific to this domain is gaining rapid momentum. Extreme weather and light conditions are typical at seas and optical cameras commonly used on land face limitations in such environment. This paper proposes usage of Long Wave Infrared (LWIR) cameras to overcome these challenges. We evaluate the effectiveness of LWIR by running semantic segmentation against two deep learning architectures under normal and challenging conditions and then comparing their performance against their optical counterparts. Experimental results show that LWIR outperforms optical in such extreme weather and light conditions and will prove very effective in the maritime environment. Integrating LWIR with optical, radar and other sensors in the robotic navigation systems can improve the accuracy of object detection and avoidance in autonomous surface vehicles.

"full-view coverage quasi-mobile camera sensor network for maritime surveillance","2014","Coverage of a camera sensor network (CSN) is a critical issue in deploying such network in maritime environment. In such environment, camera sensors will not be stationary after the initial deployment due to the hostile sea environment. Hence, the mobility pattern poses a major limitation on identifying the time-varying coverage. In full-view coverage, target's facing direction has been introduced to judge whether a target's facing direction is guaranteed to be captured. To this end, we exploit full-view coverage in CSN, since image shots at the frontal viewpoint of a given target considerably increase the possibility to detect and recognize the target. In this paper, we have developed a mobility pattern based on wind speed and spring relaxation technique which are used to characterize the total displacement of a given buoy. Furthermore, the average percentage of full-view coverage has been evaluated based on different parameters such as equilateral triangle grid length, sensing radius of camera, wind speed and wave height.

"the real-time reliable detection of the horizon line on high-resolution maritime images for unmanned surface-vehicle","2020","Horizon detection is useful in maritime image processing for various purposes, such as spatial orientation estimation of ship camera and detection of the significant region for post-processing. This paper proposed a novel realtime optimization-based method for detecting the horizon line in maritime images. Traditional methods defined the horizon line detection problem aim to detect the horizon line which perfectly divides the whole image into two regions as the sky and sea. Thus, the complication of traditional methods is the statistical distance metrics of distributions are calculated in the whole image by all combinations of the horizon line parameters. Moreover, traditional methods do not provide realtime processing to detect the horizon line from high-resolution images. To achieve real-time processing on high-resolution images, this study defines the local features of the horizon line using a vanishing line characteristic and the optimization criteria. In addition, the optimization process is improved by combining a genetic algorithm and a coarse-to-fine approach. Our method applied the Singapore marine dataset and the Buoy dataset.

"wide-area spaceborne maritime surveillance system","2017","Wide Area Aerial Surveillance (WAAS) systems are gaining popularity nowadays. The main function of WAAS systems is to obtain high resolution images of a large area and create knowledge to facilitate situational awareness.

"an adaptive threshold fast dbscan algorithm with preserved trajectory feature points for vessel trajectory clustering","2023","Vessel navigation pattern recognition plays an important role in the research of intelligent transportation on water. Clustering using the data stored in The Automatic Identification System (AIS) is a current research hotspot. However, there are three problems in the past clustering analysis. First, the traditional Douglas-Peucker (DP) Compression Algorithm exists feature point loss and trajectory distortion when compressing trajectories. Second, Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm require high time cost. Finally, most of the studies ignore the interaction between parameters when choosing the parameters of DBSCAN. These problems seriously affect the efficiency and accuracy of clustering. To solve these problems, this paper improves the existing methods by (1) Adaptive selection of compression thresholds and trajectory feature points for each trajectory when using the DP algorithm ensures the realism of the compressed trajectory; (2) using the Fast-DTW algorithm to improve the computation speed and ensure the accuracy of trajectory similarity; (3) Self-selection of parameter combinations based on Silhouette Coefficient (SC) scores was achieved using the similarity distribution of the trajectories in combination with an improved K-Adaptive Nearest Neighbors (KANN). The experiments show that the proposed method can greatly reduce the time cost of clustering compared to the original method and significantly outperforms the three compared algorithms in terms of clustering effect images.","Fast-DTW,Ship trajectory clustering,AF-DP,DBSCAN,Navigation pattern recognition,"
"horizon detection from electro-optical sensors under maritime environment","2020","In recent years, target detection in maritime surveillance has become a popular subject. Horizon under maritime environment is one of the most important semantic boundaries for segmenting the image into sea and sky. With the help of horizon, seeking scope can be restricted to a definite small area, which significantly reduces the computational complexity. Meanwhile, horizon is used to automatically adjust the attitude of air vehicles as well. Although a plenty of algorithms for horizon detection have been created, they are prone to low visibility and occlusions. In this paper, a novel robust algorithm based on probability distribution and physical characteristics is proposed. At first, the probabilities are distributed to each vertically divided region by weighted textures, and the sea-sky region is located from definite probabilistic intervals. Based on a Canny edge detector, Hough transform extracts a series of candidate horizons. Finally, a novel voting method is applied. The line with the maximum value will be regarded as the true horizon. The proposed algorithm can not only precisely detect the horizon from fine images but also from blurred image, even with splashed camera. The performance of the proposed algorithm is verified by experiments on 65 videos containing more than 20 000 frames under different sceneries. The results illustrate that our algorithm can detect the horizon line with minor errors in comparison with other five state-of-the-art algorithms.","Image edge detection,electro-optical sensors,target detection,Feature extraction,Contextual information,Image color analysis,edge detection,sea-sky region,seaâ€“sky region extraction,Hough transforms,maritime surveillance,object detection,Probability distribution,image texture,horizon detection,electro-optical devices,physical characteristics,semantic boundaries,electro-optical sensor,maritime environment,marine communication,image sensors,Sensors,Computational modeling,image segmentation,Transforms,"

"hfpnet: super feature aggregation pyramid network for maritime remote sensing small-object detection","2023","In recent years, with the development of the maritime industry, computer vision tasks based on optical remote sensing images have gained increasing attention in the field of marine remote sensing. However, in complex marine meteorological environments, traditional detection methods often suffer from high rates of missed detections and false alarms for small targets. To address this issue, this article proposes a super feature pyramid network (HFPNet) for detecting marine remote sensing objects, which includes a feature enhancement module (FEM) and a multiscale feature aggregation module (MFM). The FEM can highlight features of small targets and weaken complex background features in detection, the MFM can share high-level and low-level features to better fuse multiscale feature information. Additionally, due to the lack of marine remote sensing object datasets, this article constructs a marine target detection dataset (MTDS) containing six types of marine objects. To address the issue of imbalanced positive and negative samples in the dataset, this article designs a network loss function to accelerate network convergence and improve the accuracy of small-target detection. Compared with other models, HFPNet achieved the highest $\text{mAP}_{0.5}$ of 97.48% and 95.46% on the self-built dataset MTDS and the public dataset NWPU-VHR-10, respectively, after environmental enhancement.

"antenna beampattern matched optimum coherent detection in high-resolution mechanically scanning maritime surveillance radars","2023","Mechanically scanning radars are still widely used in ocean guard and surveillance areas nowadays, owing to simple structure, light weight and low cost. The antenna rotation causes amplitude modulation of target returns along pulses by the antenna azimuth beampattern. The traditional coherent detection that ignores this modulation suffers from some performance loss. In this article, an antenna beampattern matched optimum coherent detector and a dual-threshold detection scheme are proposed for high-resolution mechanically scanning maritime surveillance radars. First, it is shown that the modulation of target returns is determined by the antenna azimuth beampattern, scan rate, and pulse repetition interval and the antenna scanning also affect the temporal correlation of sea clutter. Second, the antenna beampattern matched optimum coherent detector is given in compound-Gaussian sea clutter with inverse Gamma distributed texture and the pulse scanning mode is used to deal with unknown target azimuth angle in the matched filter. Third, to mitigate the high computational cost of the pulse scanning mode, a dual-threshold scheme is given, which searches all pulse-range cells by short-time integration and further confirms suspected cells whose test statistics are between the two lower and higher thresholds in the search by long-time integration. Moreover, two fast recursive clutter covariance matrix inversion algorithms along pulses and range cells are presented, which bring a great reduction in computational complexity.

"an unambiguous imaging method of moving target for maritime scenes with spaceborne high-resolution and wide-swath sar","2022","In azimuth multichannel high-resolution and wide-swath (AMC-HRWS) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) system, undersampling of azimuth signal results in the failure of the single-channel echo imaging, so the echoes of all the channels should be reconstructed to obtain the unambiguous SAR image. Many methods have been proposed to reconstruct the stationary scene echoes. However, moving targets (MTs) will cause false targets in the reconstructed SAR image, which has a great influence on SAR image interpretation and moving target detection, especially in maritime scenes. Hence, we propose an unambiguous imaging method of the moving target for maritime scenes with AMC-HRWS SAR. First, azimuth deramp processing is introduced to obtain coarse-focused moving targets, and then their echoes can be extracted from the sea clutter. Based on the extracted data, a radial velocity estimation method is proposed, which is high efficiency and does not require redundant channels. In addition, based on the estimated radial velocity and the characteristics of the coarse-focused signal, a novel signal reconstruction method of moving target is presented. The reconstruction performance of this method is not affected by channel imbalance, and false targets can be removed even if there is radial velocity error. Besides, the effectiveness of this scheme is verified by the simulation data and GaoFen-3 SAR real data. The estimated radial velocities of ships are verified by automatic identification system (AIS) information.

The proposed spatiotemporal clustering algorithm spatially clusters vessels in the water space using k-means clustering analysis, kinematically refines the clusters based on the similarity of vessel headings, speeds and the distance between them, and temporally analyzes the continuity of membership of the kinematic clusters through time to determine which clusters are moving. The algorithm is implemented in the MATLAB programming environment, verified with a synthetic data scenario, and validated with two real-world datasets.","Kinematics,spatiotemporal clustering algorithm,Clustering algorithms,Spatiotemporal phenomena,Spatiotemporal clustering,maritime domain awareness,Global Positioning System,MATLAB programming,Filtering,marine safety,maritime domain,vessel headings,vessel interaction,water space,marine communication,Visualization,Algorithm design and analysis,k-means clustering analysis,vessel speeds,Arrays,"
"optimal offloading of computing-intensive tasks for edge-aided maritime uav systems","2022","This paper considers the autonomous detecting and tracking task of the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in the maritime environment. In the maritime UAV tracking system, due to the large size of the image computing-task and the shortage of UAV batteries and computational capability, the UAV needs to offload the computing-intensive task to the edge computing server (ECS) to reduce energy consumption and task latency. However, the task latency is still too long for the UAV tracking algorithm due to the large image size. We research the impact of image resolution on the computing task size and detection accuracy, and formulate an edge-aided UAV system with dynamic image resolution. With the constraint on task latency, we jointly optimize the image resolution, offloading rate, transmission power and local central processing unit (CPU) frequency to minimize energy consumption. Although the proposed problem is non-convex, we transform it into a convex optimization problem through decoupling and problem decomposition, and obtain an optimal offloading strategy. The numerical results show the energy efficiency of the proposed strategy by comparing it with the local first offloading strategy and the edge first offloading strategy.","Image edge detection,autonomous detecting,image resolution,Energy consumption,Vehicular and wireless technologies,edge computing server,image size,unmanned aerial vehicle,Target tracking,optimisation,edge computing,tracking task,convex optimization problem,UAV batteries,offload,visual target tracking,Autonomous aerial vehicles,power aware computing,computational capability,optimal offloading strategy,edge-aided maritime UAV systems,computing task size,autonomous aerial vehicles,marine engineering computing,dynamic image resolution,maritime environment,energy consumption,Image resolution,energy conservation,computing-intensive task,Transforms,UAV tracking algorithm,UAV,edge-aided UAV system,image computing-task,"

"a lightweight approach to simulate a 2d radar coverage for virtual maritime environments","2013","Virtual simulation systems present a cost effective way of training the mariners to navigate a ship in a realistic maritime environment. To offer a better training session, a need arises to model other tools and components as a part of the virtual simulation system, such as radar, sonar and telescope, that are used to navigate a vessel in the real world. Taking a light-weighted approach, we developed a virtual radar coverage for the Vidusayura virtual maritime learning environment.

"robust infrared maritime target detection based on visual attention and spatiotemporal filtering","2017","It has always been a great challenge to efficiently detect small infrared targets from complex image backgrounds without any prior knowledge. This is especially true when both strong and weak targets appear in the same image or when the weak targets come up on image borders. The main contribution of this paper is to design a robust infrared maritime target detection method, in which a visual attention and pipeline-filtering model is proposed by integrating a revised visual attention model (VAM) and the antivibration pipeline-filtering algorithm. The revised VAM, a single-frame target detection strategy, will first compute a saliency map (SM) from a specific modality, which is automatically selected according to image background smoothness. Then, an automatic strategy for extracting suspected targets from an SM is also proposed here, which highlights targets and suppresses background clutters in SMs through local saliency singularity evaluation. Moreover, contrary to the original VAM, we adopt border saliency preservation in center-surround difference so that robust detection can be guaranteed for targets on image borders. Finally, to eliminate the interference of sea glints and confirm real targets, we adopt the antivibration pipeline-filtering algorithm, a multiframe-based clutter removal method. Compared with the original VAM and two other existing target detection algorithms, experimental results have proven that our strategy can detect infrared maritime targets much better under different environmental conditions. This research can significantly improve the success rate and efficiency of searching maritime targets in different weathers using infrared imager, especially in heavy sea fog and strong ocean waves.","sea glint,remote sensing,infrared maritime target detection method,Image color analysis,geophysical image processing,Ocean waves,fog,ocean waves,image border,saliency singularity evaluation,visual attention model,object detection,single-frame target detection strategy,pipeline-filtering model,saliency map,image filtering,Robustness,Image segmentation,image background smoothness,infrared imaging,Clutter,Visualization,infrared imager,infrared surveillance,Object detection,Computational modeling,antivibration pipeline-filtering algorithm,multiframe-based clutter removal method,sea fog,target detection algorithm,ocean wave,"

"integrated maritime surveillance (ims) for the grand banks","1997","June 1997 will see the launch of a new approach to surveillance of the 200 nautical mile Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). Work on a demonstration system off Canada's east coast began in March 1996. This collaborative project is the result of more than a decade of research and development. The demonstration system will provide continuous, all-weather surveillance of aircraft, surface vessels, icebergs and environmental conditions in the Grand Banks region to beyond the 200 mile limit.

Then a logic rule is applied to detect the abnormal targets. The proposed method is tested with real data from a coastal surveillance radar.

"development of a time series imaging approach for fault classification of marine systems","2022","As part of any Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) system for the shipping industry, the determination of the current health of marine systems is fundamental. As such, diagnostic analytics is performed; a process that is typically constituted by fault detection, fault isolation, and fault identification. Although some efforts have been made to distinguish the faults and malfunctions (fault detection) that can occur in marine systems, the implementation of fault identification to provide a description of any considered fault type and its nature is still an unexplored area due to the lack of fault data. To overcome this, a methodology for the identification of anomalies in marine systems is presented in this paper. The proposed approach aims to analyse the implementation of time series imaging through the application of the first-order Markov chain in tandem with an analysis of both ResNet50V2 and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) as part of the image classification task. To highlight the performance of this methodology, anomalies have been simulated considering the power parameter of a diesel generator. Results demonstrated the potential of time series imaging and image classification approaches, as the Markov-CNN achieved an accuracy of 95% when performing the fault classification task.","Anomaly identification,Time series imaging,Marine systems,Fault diagnosis,Prognostics and health management (PHM),Fault classification,Shipping industry,"
"joint tracking and classification for extended targets in maritime surveillance","2018","In the framework of target tracking, joint tracking and classification (JTC) based approaches have been recently introduced to adjust the trajectory estimation to a given type of target. In a maritime surveillance framework, these approaches leverage marine radar capabilities to provide high resolution measurements. It can then be helpful to choose relevant motion models regarding the tracking algorithm. Among them, the authors recently proposed to take advantage of the target extent measurements for single or multiple-target tracking. This work was based on a point source hypothesis regarding the position measurement of each target. However, this is no longer suitable for extended target tracking. An extension of our previous work to track properly extended targets whose position measurement can be obtained from any point source of its surface is thus proposed. For this purpose, random matrix theory is leveraged.

"submarine groundwater discharge detection through remote sensing: an application of landsat 7 and 8 in hawaiʻi and ireland","2022","Submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) represents an important component of the global water cycle. Improved assessment of SGD occurrences provides information to constrain current estimates of total freshwater discharges, which are crucial for evaluation of changes in the global water cycle. This study leverages SGD linkages to patterns in sea surface temperature (SST) and color. Typically, groundwater temperatures exhibit less variability than SST and tend to have temperature distinct from sea water. Consequently, thermally anomalous plumes often occur in coastal areas with SGD. Nutrient-enriched groundwater flows have been linked to changes in ocean color as a consequence of algae growth and of the presence of colored dissolved organic matter. Under such conditions, SGD presence may also manifest as plumes of different colors. Changes in SST and color can be captured through satellite imagery for the thermal infrared and visible bands, which are used here to detect potential SGD (PSGD) occurrences. A method based on clustering and spectroscopy techniques is applied to automatically detect PSGD plumes. SST data are clustered to map SST anomalies. Derivative analysis and angular distance are applied to identify a color signature linked to SGD. In a novel approach, SST and color are combined to identify PSGD through remote sensing. The methods presented in this study were applied to Landsat 7 and 8 imagery captured over southern Ireland and the west coast of the Island of Hawaiʻi, where past field surveys of radon isotopes activities and salinity have documented SGD occurrences. These selected sites are used as validation points. Derivative analysis and angular distance resulted in PSGD plumes in the vicinity of sampled locations, mainly locations with samples that are strong indicators of SGD. In general, the PSGD plumes derived from each method are compared as independent, parallel lines of evidence of PSGD occurrences. Results also show that PSGD pixels from derivative analysis and angular distance alone, without considering SST, can be obfuscated by confounding factors, such as low tides and unrelated chlorophyll enrichment, and that combining SST and color data reduces those effects. These results provide further evidence for PSGD occurrences along the south coast of Ireland and the west coast of the Island of Hawaiʻi, and showcase that satellite data can be used to better identify the location of PSGD occurrences over large areas.","Coastal waters,Submarine groundwater discharge,Ocean color,Sea surface temperature,"

"practical multichannel sar imaging in the maritime environment","2018","The U.S. Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) recently developed an X-band airborne multichannel synthetic aperture radar (MSAR) test bed system that consists of 32 along-track phase centers. This system was deployed in September 2014 and again in October 2015 to perform extensive and systematic data collections on a variety of land and maritime scenes under different environmental conditions. This paper presents a detailed experimental analysis of imaging in the maritime domain using data captured by the NRL MSAR system. After presenting some of the important details of our NRL MSAR system, we demonstrate velocity-based imaging of a variety of moving backscatter sources including ships and shoaling ocean waves. Our analysis is based on the velocity SAR (VSAR) technique, which was originally conceived by Friedlander and Porat. Practical application of this algorithm in the maritime domain requires a number of pre- and postprocessing stages, which are described here in detail. Our results are then benchmarked against the traditional along-track interferometry, where it is demonstrated that VSAR processing is better able to correctly compensate motion-induced distortion.","marine radar,Radar antennas,Distortion,sea surface,image enhancement,X-band airborne multichannel synthetic aperture radar test bed system,Synthetic aperture radar,velocity SAR technique,ocean waves,ships,NRL MSAR system,synthetic aperture radar,practical multichannel SAR imaging,microwave antenna arrays,radar imaging,maritime scenes,maritime environment,Image resolution,Radar imaging,U.S. Naval Research Laboratory,Imaging,Image motion analysis,"
"background modeling combined with multiple features in the fourier domain for maritime infrared target detection","2022","To detect ship targets in dynamic sea backgrounds, a robust foreground detection method based on background modeling combined with multiple features in the Fourier domain (BMMFF) is proposed. Because the fluctuation of seawater is similar to a sine wave, the amplitude spectrum of the seawater in the Fourier domain has strong energy concentration, and the background model is built in the Fourier domain. The local statistical characteristics can effectively reflect the properties of a specific position, and the target frequency points are extracted by comparing the local statistical characteristic differences between the amplitude spectrum of the test frame and the updated background. Additionally, two different strategies are used to update the background for cases with or without sudden waves in two adjacent test frames. When the target and seawater have different contrast in different scenes, the threshold is set according to the seawaterâ€™s fluctuation degree, which is classified into three different levels in the training stage. Moreover, the linear correlation feature between the test frame and the updated background and the oscillation feature of the test frameâ€™s amplitude spectrum are proposed in the Fourier domain, which can better segment targets in relatively calm and violent sea scenes, respectively. Thus, the two features are combined with the background model with a reasonable strategy to further improve the detection accuracy. The experimental results demonstrate that BMMFF outperforms related comparison algorithms in different challenging sea scenes. The average false alarm rate of BMMFF is reduced by approximately 30% in the case where its average detection rate is similar to that of other algorithms.","target frequency points,linear correlation feature,Marine vehicles,Feature extraction,seawater,sea scenes,statistical analysis,dynamic sea backgrounds,ships,marine engineering,background modeling,object detection,ship targets,Oscillators,feature extraction,Correlation,Adaptation models,foreground detection method,infrared imaging,Dual-mode sea background model,local statistical characteristic differences,Object detection,image segmentation,Data mining,oscillation feature,Fourier domain,maritime infrared target detection,"
"maritime incident information extraction using machine and deep learning techniques","2021","In this paper, we present several Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for extracting information about piracy from unstructured maritime news articles. The first technique is a document segmentation algorithm, which, given an article that may discuss several unrelated topics, separates the document into a list of maritime incidents. This technique takes advantage of the notion that maritime articles tend to include many precise dates and achieves an F1-score of 0.82 on a dataset of 52 articles. The second technique extracts the names and types of ships involved in a maritime incident using a combination of Named Entity Recognition (NER) and database lookups; an F1-score of 0.89 is achieved. The third and final technique determines the incident type, the severity of the incident, the response taken by the victim, and the eventual impact of this response.

"estimation of target detectability for maritime target tracking in the pda framework","2019","The detection probability of maritime vessels may change over time, either slowly or more abruptly, due to effects such as sea state and varying aspect angle. If the varying detectability is not accounted for in the tracking system, tracks may be terminated or lost. The undetected targets may cause dangerous situations in applications such as maritime collision avoidance. In the following, we propose two methods for tracking targets with varying detection probability, both in the integrated probabilistic data association (IPDA) framework. One method uses the number of validated measurements to estimate the detectability of the target, while the other calculates the joint detectability and existence probabilities based on the measurement association likelihoods. Both methods show significant improvements over the conventional Markov chain 1 and 2 IPDAs.","Markov processes,PDA framework,sensor fusion,Handheld computers,maritime vessels,estimation theory,Sea measurements,target tracking,detection probability,IPDA framework,maritime collision avoidance,Target tracking,Collision avoidance,Radar tracking,target detectability estimation,Logic gates,undetected target tracking system,signal detection,probability,Probability,integrated probabilistic data association framework,maritime target tracking,Markov chain,measurement association likelihoods,"
"quantitative and qualitative evaluation of plastic particles in surface waters of the western black sea","2021","Microplastic abundances have been studied intensively in the last years in marine and freshwater environments worldwide. Though several articles have been published about the Mediterranean Sea, only few studies about the Black Sea exist. The Black Sea drains into the Mediterranean Sea and may therefore significantly contribute to the Mediterranean marine pollution. So far, only very few articles have been published about micro-, meso- and macroplastic abundances in the Western Black Sea. In order to fill this knowledge gap and to decipher the number of plastics on the water surface, 12 samples were collected from surface waters with a neustonic net (mesh size 200 μm) in the Black Sea close to the Danube Delta and the Romanian shore. Organic matter was digested and plastic particles were isolated by density separation. The results of visual inspection, pyrolysis GC-MS (for microplastics) and ATR-FTIR (for mesoplastics >5 mm) revealed an average concentration of 7 plastic particles/m³, dominated by fibers (∼76%), followed by foils (∼13%) and fragments (∼11%). Only very few spherules were detected. The polymers polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE) dominated which is in line with other studies analyzing surface waters from rivers in Western Europe as well as in China. Statistical analyses show that the plastic concentration close to the mouth of the Danube River was significantly higher than at four nearshore regions along the Romanian and Bulgarian coastline. This could be explained by plastic inputs from the Danube River into the western part of the Black Sea.","Danube Delta,Romanian coast,Plastic pollution,Spectroscopy,Black Sea,"
"sensorized buoy for oil spill early detection","2016","The Sea is often a fragile environment to be protected against possible pollutants. In this context, the present work contributes to its safeguard by proposing a new buoy equipped with advanced sensors for the detection of oil spills. In particular, the buoy is provided with various sensors for the evaluation of both meteorological and marine parameters (e.g. waves, wind, temperature), and chemical/physical data acquired by an electronic nose system specifically designed for the detection of hydrocarbons. The electronic nose is composed of a flow chamber, a chamber equipped with photo ionization sensors, pumps and valves for air inlet and outlet, and a low-cost electronic board. The designed system samples the air above the water and produces data that are processed through two artificial neural networks allowing for a classification of detected hydrocarbons and overall pollution level. Suitable network interfaces and a connector toward a Marine Information System (MIS) allow both for real-time data visualization and for long-term assessment of water quality.","Oil spills,Marine pollution,Hydrocarbons classification,Sensorized buoy,Electronic noses,"
"real-time event-based tracking and detection for maritime environments","2021","Event cameras are ideal for object tracking applications due to their ability to capture fast-moving objects while mitigating latency and data redundancy. Existing event-based clustering and feature tracking approaches for surveillance and object detection work well in the majority of cases, but fall short in a maritime environment. Our application of maritime vessel detection and tracking requires a process that can identify features and output a confidence score representing the likelihood that the feature was produced by a vessel, which may trigger a subsequent alert or activate a classification system. However, the maritime environment presents unique challenges such as the tendency of waves to produce the majority of events, demanding the majority of computational processing and producing false positive detections. By filtering redundant events and analyzing the movement of each event cluster, we can identify and track vessels while ignoring shorter lived and erratic features such as those produced by waves.","surveillance,subsequent alert classification system,image motion analysis,Feature extraction,maritime vessel detection,redundant events,Filtering,activate a classification system,object tracking,data redundancy,false positive detections,real-time systems,event-based clustering,Hardware,cameras,object detection,computational processing,event cameras,image classification,pattern clustering,Real-time systems,marine engineering computing,Redundancy,maritime environment,Object detection,Surveillance,time event-based tracking,object tracking applications,event cluster,"
"supporting maritime search and rescue missions through uas-based wireless localization","2018","The use of unmanned aircraft systems to support maritime search and rescue missions holds great potential. Applications range from the fast and efficient search of vessels and persons in distress to the provision of rescue and communication resources. In this paper, we address a received signal strength based localization method of persons without dedicated search and rescue equipment. The specific challenge addressed in this work is to analyze the proposed localization method under realistic conditions. Thus, a maritime channel model is implemented and by means of field tests experimentally validated. Furthermore, the proposed approach is evaluated in a two step concept: In the first step the capability of different search patterns and localization algorithms is analyzed and evaluated in a hardware in the loop simulation environment. In the second step, a scaled experimental setup, which uses a technology comparable to cellular communications, is evaluated to prove the viability of the overall system. Besides the overall accuracy, the required localization time is a key performance indicator. The resulting outcome of the simulations using active trajectory generation underlines the potential of the discussed approach by achieving localization errors of lower than 200 m in under 10 mins.

"target observability improvement in multi-static maritime forward scatter radar","2014","In recent years, the use of shore or buoy mounted forward scatter radar transceivers for the detection of small, low radar cross section, slow speed (otherwise termed low detectability) maritime targets has been proposed and investigated. Work has focused on the fundamental development of the single baseline link, which would form the basis of any netted system and has mostly been investigated at the lower end of the sea state scale. However as sea state increases, one of the main issues for target detection becomes the visibility time due to line of sight interruption. With a single line chain, this could be a major drawback for the system function as a whole, restricting its use to lower sea states. The formation of multiple baselines using multi-static transceivers could however improve the situation greatly.

"performance measures for airborne maritime surveillance radars","1998","A typical performance specification for an airborne maritime surveillance radar might be defined as the ability to detect, say, a 5 m/sup 2/ target in sea state 3 at a range of at least 25 nmi in clear air, with a detection probability of 0.9 and with one false alarm per minute. This is a basic statement of a user's needs but it is very inadequate as a specification of the radar performance that is actually required. The performance of an operational radar is characterised by many other features, which are not simply summarised in terms of a detection range and false alarm rate in a generalised environment. In particular, concepts such as probability of detection and probability of false alarm are conventionally steady state performance measures, for operation in thermal noise or uniformly distributed clutter. In practice, the radar will be dynamically adjusting its thresholds in response to a spatially and temporally varying environment. This will lead to a dynamic variation in detection and false alarm rate that cannot be simply described by traditional methods. This paper describes some of the problems with standard performance measures which are used for radar and proposes a number of further measures which should be considered to fully characterise a radar, especially under dynamically changing conditions.","uniformly distributed clutter,operational radar,performance specification,search radar,airborne maritime surveillance radars,user's needs,performance measures,detection probability,steady state performance measures,thermal noise,detection range,dynamically changing conditions,false alarm rate,"
"maritime shift workers sleepiness detection system with multi-modality cues","2019","Sleepiness has been recognized as a causal factor in many round-the-clock industries. While individuals can subjectively express their momentary sleepiness level, sleepiness-related contextual factors (CF) can influence their perception of sleepiness and cognitive performance. In this paper, the self-reported sleepiness value (vSRS) was improved by transforming it into a kernel density estimate and the assignment of the class's score is done using a likelihood ratio test (IvSRS). We integrated multiple CF and IvSRS to model sleepiness using a Bayesian network (BN). The BN produced a single probability estimate calculated based on the prior and posterior probability of the CF and IvSRS.

"global sensitivity of radar wave propagation power to environmental variables for a parabolic equation numerical simulation in maritime regions","2015","Numerous environmental factors impact radio wave propagation in the marine atmospheric boundary layer (MABL) through effects such as scattering and refraction. Furthermore, environmental parameters can interact with each other to either compound or reduce the impact of each individual parameter. Thus, in order to properly assess the sensitivity of radar wave propagation power to environmental variables a global sensitivity approach is needed. In this study, we examine the global sensitivity of propagation power to a number of environmental variables using a parabolic equation (PE) numerical simulation for maritime regions. The sensitivity analysis is performed using the Extended Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Test, which is a global variance-based method that can account for multi-degree interaction effects. The method is ideal for complex nonlinear models and permits computation of both leading order and total order sensitivity for each parameter. The study examines 16 environmental parameters, 8 sea state and 8 atmospheric, that are used to generate inputs for the Variable Terrain Radiowave Parabolic Equation (VTRPE) numerical simulation. This model uses a split-step rotated Green's function parabolic wave equation solution to the scalar wave equation for transverse field components derived from Maxwell's equations. The simulation accounts for effects of refraction (including ducting) as well as variable boundary conditions on water surfaces, such as wind seas, swell, and variable dielectric properties. Vertical profiles of atmospheric refractivity, which are assumed homogenous in range for this study, are generated using a simplified refractivity model that depends on the 8 atmospheric parameters and can generate linear refractivity profiles as well as evaporation, surface, and elevated ducts, including any combination of these ducts. Sea state parameters can be grouped into 3 general categories: surface dielectric properties, directionality, and surface roughness. Atmospheric parameters can be grouped into 4 general categories: evaporation layer, mixed layer, inversion layer, and upper layer parameters. We examine results in the context of these parameter groupings.",""
"wasrâ€”a water segmentation and refinement maritime obstacle detection network","2022","Obstacle detection using semantic segmentation has become an established approach in autonomous vehicles. However, existing segmentation methods, primarily developed for ground vehicles, are inadequate in an aquatic environment as they produce many false positive (FP) detections in the presence of water reflections and wakes. We propose a novel deep encoderâ€“decoder architecture, a water segmentation and refinement (WaSR) network, specifically designed for the marine environment to address these issues. A deep encoder based on ResNet101 with atrous convolutions enables the extraction of rich visual features, while a novel decoder gradually fuses them with inertial information from the inertial measurement unit (IMU). The inertial information greatly improves the segmentation accuracy of the water component in the presence of visual ambiguities, such as fog on the horizon. Furthermore, a novel loss function for semantic separation is proposed to enforce the separation of different semantic components to increase the robustness of the segmentation. We investigate different loss variants and observe a significant reduction in FPs and an increase in true positives (TPs). Experimental results show that WaSR outperforms the current state of the art by approximately 4% in F1 score on a challenging unmanned surface vehicle dataset.

Salvage operation of the vessel started immediately after the wreck.

The refloating and removal phases of the Costa Concordia were monitored, in the period between 14th and 27th of July, exploiting SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) images acquired by the X-band COSMO-SkyMed satellite constellation in crisis mode. The main targets of the monitoring system were: (i) the detection of possible spill of pollutant material from the vessel and (ii) to exclude that oil slicks, illegally produced by other vessels, could be improperly linked to the naval convoy during its transit along the route between the Giglio Island and the port of Genoa. Results point out that the adopted monitoring system, through the use of the COSMO-SkyMed constellation, can be profitably employed to monitor emergency phases related to single ship or naval convoy over wide areas and with a suitable temporal coverage. Furthermore, the refloating and removal phases of the Costa Concordia were a success because no pollution was produced during the operations.","COSMO-SkyMed,Oil spill,Costa Concordia,SAR,Wreck,"

A fusion of three different detection algorithms is performed to create reliable alarm hypotheses. In the following, a set of well-investigated features is extracted from the alarm hypotheses and evaluated using a two-stage-classification with support vector machines (SVMs) in order to distinguish between three object classes: clutter, irrelevant objects and suspicious boats. On the given image data we achieve a rate of 97% correct classifications.","infrared image sequences,suspicious boats,border protection,Support vector machines,radar clutter,illegal immigration,Feature extraction,drug trafficking,environmental condition,support vector machines,maritime surveillance,search radar,small boat classification,piracy,image quality,clutter,Histograms,Training,infrared imaging,image sequences,Boats,marine communication,Clutter,"
"track-before-detect using an airborne multichannel radar in the maritime domain","2023","This article explores methods for the detection and tracking of maritime targets using an airborne scanning multichannel radar, operating at high altitudes. The main technical difficulties include 1) the nonstationary and non-Gaussian nature of sea clutter when using a high-resolution airborne radar and 2) low-target signal-to-interference ratios due to higher grazing angles. It is proposed to carry out processing in two stages. First, space-time adaptive processing (STAP) is applied to exploit the spatial and temporal degrees of freedom available in the multichannel radar. Subsequently, target detection and tracking is performed using the track-before-detect method, applied to the STAP output. For the sake of comparison, a more traditional tracking method is also developed, where a detection threshold is applied to the STAP output, to obtain point measurements, subsequently processed via an extended target tracking methodology.

It proposes to create an intelligent maritime surveillance system by equipping unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with different types of optical sensors. Optical sensors such as cameras (visible, infrared, multi and hyper spectral) can contribute significantly to the generation of situational awareness of maritime events such as (i) detection and georeferencing of oil spills or hazardous and noxious substances; (ii) tracking systems (e.g. vessels, shipwrecked, lifeboat, debris, etc.); (iii) recognizing behavioral patterns (e.g. vessels rendezvous, high-speed vessels, atypical patterns of navigation, etc.); and (iv) monitoring parameters and indicators of good environmental status. On-board transponders will be used for collision detection and avoidance mechanism (sense and avoid). This paper describes the core of the research and development work done during the first 2 years of the project with particular emphasis on the following topics: system architecture, automatic detection of sea vessels by vision sensors and custom designed computer vision algorithms; and a sense and avoid system developed in the theoretical framework of zero-sum differential games.","aircraft,behavioral patterns,optical sensors,SEAGULL project,Aircraft,Games,zero-sum differential games,noxious substances,Sun,intelligent maritime surveillance system,Aerospace control,Computer Vision,hazardous substances,Sense and Avoid,Reflection,cameras,intelligent sensors,oil spills,unmanned aircraft systems,tracking systems,autonomous aerial vehicles,hazards,image sensors,Algorithm design and analysis,Sensors,sea vessels,vision sensors,maritime operations,on-board transponders,Unmanned Aerial Vehicles,oceanographic techniques,"

Challenging maritime scenarios have been chosen to assess the detectors' performance against features such as ambiguities, significant sea clutter, or irregular shorelines. The SAR images which form the test data are complemented with ground truth to define the reference detection configuration, which permits quantifying the probability of detection, the false alarm rate, and the accuracy of estimating ship dimensions. Although the results show that all the detectors perform well, there is no perfect detector, and a better detection system could be developed that combines the best elements from each of the single detectors.

"rep-enhancer: re-parameterizing neural network for real-time low-light enhancement in visual maritime surveillance","2022","Vision-based maritime surveillance has become an essential part of the vessel traffic services system. The images collected in low-light maritime conditions often suffer from poor visibility. These images may significantly degenerate the performance of high-level visual tasks and increase the uncertainty in maritime surveillance. To address this problem, we propose a lightweight neural network (Rep-Enhancer) for low-light image enhancement. Specifically, we first design a re-parameterizable multi-branch edge extraction module, i.e., spatial domain-oriented convolution block (SDCB). Furthermore, skip connections and spatial attention operations are employed to strengthen the features. By exploiting these well-strengthened edge features, we can enhance the low-light images effectively with the encoder-decoder structure.

"seadronessee: a maritime benchmark for detecting humans in open water","2022","Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are of crucial importance in search and rescue missions in maritime environments due to their flexible and fast operation capabilities. Modern computer vision algorithms are of great interest in aiding such missions. However, they are dependent on large amounts of real-case training data from UAVs, which is only available for traffic scenarios on land. Moreover, current object detection and tracking data sets only provide limited environmental information or none at all, neglecting a valuable source of information. Therefore, this paper introduces a large-scaled visual object detection and tracking benchmark (SeaDronesSee) aiming to bridge the gap from land-based vision systems to sea-based ones.

"a preliminary study on an optical system for nautical and maritime traffic monitoring","2021","The nautical traffic is very difficult to monitor since many vessels are not cooperative. VTSs (Vessel Traffic Systems) use several sources of information for estimating shipsâ€™ Position Navigation and Velocity, such as AIS (Automatic Identification System) and RADAR (RAdio Detection And Ranging); nevertheless, VTS areas do not cover the entire costal area of a country. In many cases the classification and identification of small non-AIS vessels could provide an important to the safety of navigation.Indeed, especially during the summer, the nautical tourism has a great impact on the maritime traffic congestion. The issue involves many institutions such as Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) and local maritime authorities which are not able to monitor the high volume of nautical traffic. This work introduces an optical system designed to monitor the traffic in small coastal areas based on images acquired by a single camera. The reliability and accuracy of the system is conditioned by the size of the pixel on the sea surface (Ground Sample Distance-GSD) and by the camera footprint area as well. More in detail, this work focuses on the detection of the best camera placement on the coast for optimizing the GSD size and obtaining the shape of camera footprint.

"assessment of marine litter through remote sensing: recent approaches and future goals","2021","This bibliographic review provides an overview of techniques used to detect marine litter using remote sensing.

Most studies applied satellite information to address marine litter using multi- and hyper- spectral optical sensors. The correspondence analysis on analyzed variables exhibited that aircrafts with high spatial resolution (<3 m) with optical sensors (λ = 400 to 2500 nm) seem to be the most optimum combination to target marine litter, while satellites carrying Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensors (λ = 3.1 to 5.6 cm) may detect sea-slicks associated to surfactants that might contain high concentration of microplastics.

"an integrated maritime reasoning and monitoring system","2012","Maritime information systems typically offer system features for data collection, information fusion and the automated construction of a basic recognized maritime picture for human operators. However making sense of maritime situations is still very much an intensive human-based cognitive endeavor. Limited human resources face difficult cognitive challenges in making sense of huge amount of data generated daily by dynamic round-the-clock maritime shipping and port activities. An effective information exploitation system for maritime surveillance and monitoring is expected to be able to augment human-based surveillance and monitoring operations with machine-based computing capabilities to interpret and reason about massive amount of situational information, as well as transforming this knowledge into actionable decision indicators for the human decision makers. The Defence Science & Technology Agency (DSTA) has developed the PACKED model to guide the exploration and development of computing technologies that support human decision making and other cognitive challenges in information rich, complex, and dynamic operational environments. An integrated maritime reasoning and monitoring system illustrates how computing technologies are applied in the areas of Attention, Knowledge, and Comprehension to support situation analysis and monitoring processes for maritime surveillance. The maritime reasoning and monitoring system consist of Bayesian reasoning, entity network analysis, and movement pattern analysis, to integrate, analyze, interpret and reason about maritime data. The Graylist Network Analysis (GNA) engine probes networks of entity-relationships to uncover â€œgraylistedâ€ entities that are closely associated with blacklisted entities. The Movement Pattern Analysis (MPA) engine uncovers common patterns in vessel movements and monitors real-time for maritime traffic data for anomalous vessel movements.

"pixel-wise ship identification from maritime images via a semantic segmentation model","2022","Accurately identifying ships from maritime surveillance videos attracts increasing attention in the smart ship community, considering that the videos provide informative yet easily understandable spatialâ€“temporal traffic information for varied maritime traffic participants. Previous studies (e.g., ship detection and ship tracking) are conducted by learning distinct features from training samples labeled in terms of bounding boxes, and thus, background pixels may be wrongly trained as ship features. To bridge the gap, we propose a novel approach for achieving a pixel-wise ship segmentation and identification task through a novel design of U-Net deep learning architecture (denoted as EU-Net). The encoder of the EU-Net extracts distinct ship features from input maritime images, and its decoder outputs ship segmentation results in the pixel-wise manner. The proposed EU-Net model consists of encoder and decoder parts via the help of a convolution layer, a depth separable convolution layer, a softmax layer, and so on. More specifically, the EU-Net model identifies each pixel into ship or non-ship as the final output. Experimental results suggest that our proposed model can accurately identify ship (in terms of pixels), considering that the ship segmentation accuracies were larger than 99%.

"development and deployment of multi-mission intelligent autonomous maritime systems","2020","Cherokee Nation Strategic Programs (CNSP) and Ocean Aero, Inc. have teamed together to demonstrate the multi-mission capabilities of commercial autonomous maritime systems. CNSP has a proven record testing, fielding, and developing Unmanned Systems (UxS) programs across air, ground, and maritime domains. Ocean Aero has developed a portfolio of intelligent autonomous underwater and surface vehicles that are uniquely engineered for a wide range of applications above and below the ocean surface. The focus of our collaboration is the accelerated deployment of autonomous capabilities in operational mission scenarios. Unmanned systems are demonstrating daily value to commercial and civilian users today. Drones are rapidly moving beyond powerful remotely controlled information capture tools into advanced networks of aerial robots providing services and access that was never before considered valuable. Ground robot technologies are maturing just as rapidly and taking on many different forms as purpose-built systems are enabling subterranean exploration, driver safety on interstate highways, and disaster response support. Maritime systems are now fulfilling the same potential with robust, all-weather designs that enable long endurance, rugged missions for marine users. The operational value that these systems provide comes from the advancements in intelligent autonomy. We are currently testing the range of autonomous capabilities of the Ocean Aero Triton Series autonomous underwater and surface vehicle systems at the University of Southern Mississippi Marine Research Center (USM MRC). The Ocean Aero vehicles are designed and built with autonomous, persistent navigation capabilities as a standard feature. Additional customized, mission-centric sensors may be added to the systems to accomplish specific operational tasks and/or increase autonomous performance. The command-and-control (C2) communication architecture provides situational awareness and mission progress monitoring for the onboard vehicle decision-making, as well as the remote operator control station. To successfully achieve the high level of autonomous operations in locations without terrestrial communications (cellular) and beyond visual line of sight, UxS use satellite communications for navigation and mission data transfer. Our testing is evaluating the ability of the autonomous systems to accomplish multiple missions, including perimeter security, tracking of other surface vehicles, environmental monitoring, and marine science missions. These evaluations include the performance of the vehicles, the sensors, and the multi-domain communication systems, while characterizing the operating conditions for each test series. â€œAutonomyâ€ is a capability that means different things to different people. Our testing at the MRC is evaluating the ability of the system to react to new information, whether from external source or self-perceived, to accomplish the intended mission, such as detection of an unknown vehicle in the area. This ability to react includes concepts such as dynamic replanning for navigation, as well as communications with the operations center for mission management awareness. Through these communications and activities, we are measuring the operator workloads in multiple missions to determine if the autonomy in the system is increasing, decreasing, or improving operator performance. Our testing team was assembled specifically to accomplish these objectives. The full technical paper will include sample test cases and data collection examples for evaluating the Ocean Aero autonomous underwater and surface vehicle technologies using the Cherokee Nation Capabilities-Based Assessment process. This is the proven, repeatable process that we have used for evaluating air, ground, and maritime unmanned systems for many customers. We use this process for assessing the operational performance of mature products, not research-only test units. This focus on technologies that are commercially available or at least products from an active production line, allow us to evaluate capabilities as they relate to mission requirements and user objectives.

Therefore, we developed a new Improved MLCC (IMLCC) to increase SNR to extract small boats. Although the IMLCC method increased SNR, there still remained some highly correlated noises in the coherence images caused by strong radar backscatter from sea surface.

"small maritime target detection using gradient vector field characterization of infrared image","2023","Infrared small maritime target detection under strong ocean waves, a challenging task, plays a key role in maritime distress target search and rescue applications. Many methods based on directionality or gradient properties have proven to perform well for infrared images with heterogeneous scenarios. However, they tend to perform poorly when facing strong ocean wave background, mainly due to the following: 1) infrared images have low signal-to-clutter ratio with low intensity for small targets; 2) some waves have high local contrast that may be similar to or higher than targets. To solve these issues, a new method based on gradient vector field characterization (GVFC) of infrared images is proposed. First, we construct the gradient vector field and coarsely extract suspected targets. Then, gradient vector distribution measure (GVDM) is presented, which comprehensively integrates a synergistic homogeneity test based on Kolmogorovâ€“Smirnov test with absolute difference standard deviation for gradient direction angle and regression analysis for gradient modulus. The proposed GVDM takes advantage of pixel-level gradient distribution property to further filtrate refined suspected targets. Moreover, gradient modulus horizontal local dissimilarity is proposed to measure the diversity of gradient modulus in horizontal direction between targets and waves, so as to enhance target saliency and suppress residual clutter simultaneously, which achieves preferable performance. Finally, a simple adaptive threshold is applied to confirm targets. Extensive experiments implemented on infrared maritime images with strong ocean waves demonstrate that the proposed method is superior to the state-of-the-art methods with respect to robustness and detection accuracy.","gradient vector distribution measure,pixel-level gradient distribution property,rescue applications,maritime target detection,radar clutter,strong ocean wave background,strong ocean waves,infrared maritime image,Sea measurements,gradient direction angle,regression analysis,gradient vector field characterization,Ocean waves,ocean waves,Target tracking,object detection,Sparse matrices,feature extraction,target saliency,small target detection,infrared image,suppress residual clutter,infrared maritime images,suspected targets,infrared imaging,maritime distress target search,Tensors,Clutter,Object detection,gradient modulus horizontal local dissimilarity,low signal-to-clutter ratio,vertical local dissimilarity,image segmentation,Gradient vector,"
"double-constrained rpca based on saliency maps for foreground detection in automated maritime surveillance","2015","The development of automated video-surveillance applications for maritime environment is a very difficult task due to the complexity of the scenes: moving water, waves, etc. The motion of the objects of interest (i.e. ships or boats) can be mixed with the dynamic behavior of the background (non-regular patterns). In this paper, a double-constrained Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA), named SCM-RPCA (Shape and Confidence Map-based RPCA), is proposed to improve the object foreground detection in maritime scenes. The sparse component is constrained by shape and confidence maps both extracted from spatial saliency maps. The experimental results in the UCSD and MarDT data sets indicate a better enhancement of the object foreground mask when compared with some related RPCA methods.","Optical imaging,automated video surveillance application,image enhancement,Matrix decomposition,MarDT data set,Noise,object detection,Shape,Sparse matrices,shape and confidence map based RPCA,saliency map,double-constrained robust principal component analysis,foreground detection,UCSD data set,objectforeground detection,Boats,Minimization,double-constrained RPCA,SCM-RPCA,object foreground enhancement,principal component analysis,video surveillance,"
"a comprehensive maritime benchmark dataset for detection, tracking and threat recognition","2021","This paper describes a new multimodal maritime dataset recorded using a multispectral suite of sensors, including AIS, GPS, radar, and visible and thermal cameras. The visible and thermal cameras are mounted on the vessel itself and surveillance is performed around the vessel in order to protect it from piracy at sea. The dataset corresponds to a series of acted scenarios which simulate attacks to the vessel by small, fast-moving boats (â€˜skiffsâ€™). The scenarios are inspired by real piracy incidents at sea and present a range of technical challenges to the different stages in an automated surveillance system: object detection, object tracking, and event recognition (in this case, threats towards the vessel). The dataset can thus be employed for training and testing at several stages of a threat detection and classification system. We also present in this paper baseline results that can be used for benchmarking algorithms performing such tasks. This new dataset fills a lack of publicly available datasets for the development and testing of maritime surveillance applications.","comprehensive maritime benchmark dataset,Benchmark testing,visible cameras,Thermal sensors,Sensor phenomena and characterization,computer crime,multimodal maritime dataset,thermal cameras,classification system,automated surveillance system,object tracking,cameras,object detection,image classification,Radar,marine engineering computing,event recognition,maritime surveillance applications,Boats,Object detection,Surveillance,video surveillance,threat recognition,threat detection,piracy incidents,"
"remote sensing annual dynamics of rapid permafrost thaw disturbances with landtrendr","2022","Permafrost is warming globally which leads to widespread permafrost thaw. Particularly ice-rich permafrost is vulnerable to rapid thaw and erosion, impacting whole landscapes and ecosystems. Retrogressive thaw slumps (RTS) are abrupt permafrost disturbances that expand by several meters each year and lead to an increased soil organic carbon release. Local Remote Sensing studies identified increasing RTS activity in the last two decades by increasing number of RTS or heightened RTS growth rates. However, a large-scale assessment across diverse permafrost regions and at high temporal resolution allowing to further determine RTS thaw dynamics and its main drivers is still lacking. In this study we apply the disturbance detection algorithm LandTrendr for automated large-scale RTS mapping and high temporal thaw dynamic assessment to North Siberia (8.1×106km2). We adapted and parametrised the temporal segmentation algorithm for abrupt disturbance detection to incorporate Landsat+Sentinel-2 mosaics, conducted spectral filtering, spatial masking and filtering, and a binary machine-learning object classification of the disturbance output to separate between RTS and false positives (F1 score: 0.609). Ground truth data for calibration and validation of the workflow was collected from 9 known RTS cluster sites using very high-resolution RapidEye and PlanetScope imagery. Our study presents the first automated detection and assessment of RTS and their temporal dynamics at large-scale for 2001–2019. We identified 50,895 RTS and a steady increase in RTS-affected area from 2001 to 2019 across North Siberia, with a more abrupt increase from 2016 onward. Overall the RTS-affected area increased by 331% compared to 2000 (2000: 20,158ha, 2001–2019: 66,699ha). Contrary to this, 5 focus sites show spatio-temporal variability in their annual RTS dynamics, with alternating periods of increased and decreased RTS development, indicating a close relationship to thaw drivers. The majority of identified RTS was active from 2000 onward and only a small proportion initiated during the assessment period, indicating that the increase in RTS-affected area was mainly caused by enlarging existing RTS and not by new RTS. The detected increase in RTS dynamics suggests advancing permafrost thaw and underlines the importance of assessing abrupt permafrost disturbances with high spatial and temporal resolution at large-scales. Obtaining such consistent disturbance products will help to parametrise regional and global climate change models.","Landsat,Sentinel-2,Time series,Permafrost thaw,Multi-spectral analysis,Thermo-erosion,Retrogressive thaw slumps,"
"bistatic sar maritime ship target 3-d image reconstruction method without distortion in local cartesian coordinate","2023","Bistatic synthetic aperture radar (BiSAR) has been attracting worldwide attention because of its forward-looking imaging and high anti-interference. In harsh environment, it is vital for BiSAR to conduct extensive surveillance, imaging, and recognition of maritime ship targets. However, under the disturbance of sea waves, the ship target has an unknown and massive 3-D rotation, so that its imaging projection plane (IPP) is also undetermined. Thus, high-dimensional random distortion appears in imaging results, making it difficult to recognize the target through 2-D distorted images effectively. To solve these problems, BiSAR maritime ship target 3-D image reconstruction method without distortion in local Cartesian coordinate (LCC) is proposed. In this article, according to positions of scatterers and rotation parameters, significant differences of different scatterers of maritime ship targets have been found in bistatic range, Doppler centroid (DC), and Doppler frequency rate (DFR), which lays a solid foundation for the scatterer separation of ship targets. On this basis, a 3-D R-DC-DFR domain is constructed, and 2-D echoes of the maritime ship target are projected into R-DC-DFR domain to separate scatterers. Then, by remapping data of transmitter and receiver in R-DC-DFR domain to LCC, as well as evaluating their similarity metric, the optimal rotation parameters of the ship target can be obtained via the maximal similarity. Therefore, the image distortion caused by the unknown IPP has been removed, and 3-D image reconstruction of ship targets can be realized without distortion in the LCC. Furthermore, to evaluate performances of 3-D image reconstruction for different rotation parameters and bistatic configurations, 3-D reconstruction index is proposed and analyzed. Both point-targets and maritime ship targets are simulated to emphasize the effectiveness of the proposed method.","local Cartesian coordinate,bistatic synthetic aperture radar (BiSAR),marine radar,R-DC-DFR domain,Image reconstruction,maritime ship target,Marine vehicles,bistatic SAR maritime ship target 3-D image reconstruction method,high-dimensional random distortion,Transmitters,Synthetic aperture radar,geophysical image processing,3-D reconstruction,ships,synthetic aperture radar,image distortion,image reconstruction,radar imaging,Doppler effect,BiSAR maritime ship target,2-D distorted images,imaging projection plane,Receivers,Imaging,point-targets,remote sensing by radar,local Cartesian coordinate (LCC),oceanographic techniques,"
"maritime infrared image super-resolution using cascaded residual network and novel evaluation metric","2022","Infrared (IR) cameras have been important surveillance sensors for autonomous surface vessels; however, their detection ranges are limited by low resolution. In this study, we collect maritime IR images, analyze the characteristics of those images, and develop datasets for training and testing. Then, a new maritime IR image super-resolution network, maritime infrared super-resolution using cascaded residual network, is developed to reconstruct IR images using a scale of 4. Moreover, different loss functions have different effects on output images; a loss function is set to be a combination of three loss functions, including mean absolute error, mean squared error, and perceptual loss. Peak signal-to-noise ratio and structural similarity index measure cannot effectively describe super-resolution performance. As the novel evaluation metric, Canny edge detection method is used because edges are important for human and target detection algorithms. Finally, experiments are conducted and the results demonstrate that the developed residual network can achieve high-quality reconstructed maritime IR images.","Image edge detection,surveillance,super-resolution,surveillance sensors,Image reconstruction,peak signal-to-noise ratio,image resolution,infrared cameras,Cameras,Marine vehicles,perceptual loss,edge detection,Superresolution,autonomous surface vessels,structural similarity index measure,visual perception,maritime IR image superresolution network,Canny edge detection method,superresolution performance,object detection,residual network,image reconstruction,mean square error methods,Maritime infrared image,Training,infrared imaging,loss function,infrared detectors,unmanned surface vehicles,Loss measurement,"

"an effective presentation of navigation information for prevention of maritime disaster using ais and 3d-gis","2013","We present a method for communicating navigation information that will assist operators to prevent maritime disaster. Although this topic has been extensively researched, the navigational situation of vessels has received little attention. However, such a navigational situation is essential for understanding water bodies and ensuring maritime safety. To provide effective navigation information, this study first analyzes the actual situation of vessel traffic using Automatic Identification System (AIS) data. Operators can be based on the analysis to understand the trend of navigation ships in water bodies as an important reference. From the results of the analysis, we constructed a representable navigational information system. Different information was unified on a Geographical Information System (GIS) in two-and three-dimensional formats. The system was demonstrated in a navigation simulation of a real voyage ship in Osaka Bay, Japan. The integrated information can be comprehensively and realistically interpreted by operators.

"mining vessel tracking data for maritime domain applications","2016","The growing number of remote sensing systems and ship reporting technologies (e.g. Automatic Identification System, Long Range Identification and Tracking, radar tracking, Earth Observation) are generating an overwhelming amount of spatio-temporal and geographically distributed data related to vessels and their movements. Research on reliable data mining techniques has proven essential to the discovery of knowledge from such increasingly available information on ship traffic at sea. Data driven knowledge discovery has very recently demonstrated its value in fields that go beyond the original maritime safety and security remits of such data. They include, but are not limited to, fisheries management, maritime spatial planning, gridding ship emissions, mapping activities at sea, risk assessment of offshore platforms, and trade indicators. The extraction of useful information from maritime Big Data is thus a key element in providing operational authorities, policy-makers and scientists with supporting tools to understand what is happening at sea and improve maritime knowledge. This work will provide a survey of the recent JRC research activities relevant to automatic anomaly detection and knowledge discovery in the maritime domain.

"improving sar wind retrieval through automatic anomalous pixel detection","2023","Satellite observations are increasingly in demand and valuable for monitoring the ocean and coastal winds in near-real-time and analyzing the data historically. However, soared up human activities, man-made constructions, and marine traffics negatively interfere and affect the reliability of observations and raise concerns about the trustworthiness of using satellite winds for many applications, such as offshore wind energy, even though Sentinel synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data is freely and easily accessible. In this paper, we presented a novel methodological framework for localization and suppression of anomalous pixels (APs), which deteriorate the confidence and accuracy of the retrieved SAR wind speeds. The backbone of the implementation relied on the constant false alarm rate (CFAR) algorithm, one of the automatic target recognition algorithms. We used a large dataset of SAR subscenes to model different sea clutter conditions after removing the potential targets. We selected the suitable distribution model that maintains a constant probability of false alarm (pfa) for the entire SAR scene. The proper pfa was optimized in various SAR scenes ranging from scenes with a considerable number of APs, such as ships and wind park clusters, to scenes with no visible APs under different wind speed conditions. The pfa optimization process prevented real wind pixels from being misidentified as APs. Applying CFAR to the logarithmic scale of raw digital numbers (log-DNs) domain with a pfa of about 3.17 × 10-5, we extracted SAR wind speeds around each ocean buoy before and after CFAR process, comparing them with their corresponding in situ wind measurements. This led to significant improvement in the quality and accuracy of SAR wind data retrieval, especially in regions with numerous man-made constructions and high marine traffics. We tested and validated our approach in the North Sea and two regions along the eastern coast of the U.S. The enclosed region, serving as a marine route for harbors in Delaware Bay, showed a substantial improvement in RMSE and BIAS after applying our approach, reducing RMSE from 2.4 m/s to 1.6 m/s and the BIAS from −1.5 m/s to −0.3 m/s. The open ocean region demonstrated stable RMSE and BIAS, indicating preservation of real wind data, as only APs affecting SAR wind speed were considered during the process.","Offshore wind farm,SAR,Sentinel-1,CFAR,Anomalous pixel,Coastal environment,"
"augmented ship tracking under occlusion conditions from maritime surveillance videos","2020","Ship tracking provides crucial on-site microscopic kinematic traffic information which benefits maritime traffic flow analysis, ship safety enhancement, traffic control, etc., and thus has attracted considerable research attentions in the maritime surveillance community. Conventional ship tracking methods yield satisfied results by exploring distinct visual ship features in maritime images, which may fail when the target ship is partially or fully sheltered by obstacles (e.g., ships, waves, etc.) in maritime videos. To overcome the difficulty, we propose an augmented ship tracking framework via the kernelized correlation filter (KCF) and curve fitting algorithm. First, the KCF model is introduced to track ships in the consecutive maritime images and obtain raw ship trajectory dataset. Second, the data anomaly detection and rectification procedure are implemented to rectify the contaminated ship positions. For the purpose of performance evaluation, we implement the proposed framework and another three popular ship tracking models on the four typical ship occlusion videos. The experimental results show that our proposed framework successfully tracks ships in maritime video clips with high accuracy (i.e., the average root mean square error (RMSE), root mean square percentage error (RMSPE), mean absolute deviation (MAD) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) are less than 10), which significantly outperforms the other popular ship trackers.","Smart ship,maritime surveillance videos,Marine vehicles,Feature extraction,maritime traffic flow analysis,augmented ship tracking,ship trajectory dataset,on-site microscopic kinematic traffic information,visual ship features,Videos,kernelized correlation filter,object tracking,ships,marine safety,marine engineering,Target tracking,object detection,feature extraction,maritime images,Correlation,curve fitting algorithm,image filtering,video signal processing,Training,curve fitting,ship occlusion videos,data anomaly detection,Visualization,traffic control,ship occlusion,traffic engineering computing,ship safety enhancement,video surveillance,visual ship tracking,"

"chapter 3 - environmental applications of remote sensing","2021","Remote sensing, the science and technology through which characteristics and properties of targets on Earth can be identified and determined from a distance, has provided systematic, dedicated, and repetitive observations of the Earth's surface (atmosphere, water, land, living species, vegetation, pollution, climate) from global to local scales. Satellite observations have contributed to the spectacular improvement of the accuracy of weather forecasts over the last few decades. Remote sensing has provided the means for detecting and quantifying the rates of pollution, and mapping and monitoring sources of pollution and the degree of remediation for their management. It has the means to respond and facilitate environmental management, and makes sound and evidence-based decisions in relation to Earth's resources at a global scale and across different continents, nations, and domains. Remote sensing currently supplies essential Earth observations to protect irreplaceable resources and provide support for sustainable economic growth, disaster resilience, management of energy and mineral resources, food and water security, and sustainability. It provides powerful tools for understanding the past and present conditions of Earth systems and components, as well as the interplay between them. Thus remote sensing could assist us to solve environmental problems, address and mitigate risks, and deliver skillful predictions of the future behaviors of Earth systems (natural disasters, state of oceans, atmosphere, land, vegetation, food, public health, etc.). And by translating these Earth observations into decision making, remote sensing could help mobilize actions to mitigate effects to the benefit of human race.","Electromagnetic radiation and sensing,Marine debris,Unmanned aerial systems,Environmental applications,Remote sensing,Imaging and non-imaging systems,Active and passive detectors,Satellite sensors,Altimeters,Image quality,Earth observation,"

"vessel detection and classification from spaceborne optical images: a literature survey","2018","This paper provides an overview of existing literature on vessel/ship detection and classification from optical satellite imagery. Although SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) is still the leading technology for maritime monitoring, the number of studies based on optical satellite data is quickly growing. Altogether we analysed 119 papers on optical vessel detection and classification for the period from 1978 to March 2017. We start by introducing all the existing sensor systems for vessel detection, but subsequently focus only on optical imaging satellites. The article demonstrates the temporal development of optical satellite characteristics and connects this to the number and frequency of publications on vessel detection. After presenting the methods used for optical imagery-based vessel detection and classification in detail, along with the achieved detection accuracies, we also report possibilities for fusing optical data with other data sources. The studied papers show that the most common factors greatly influencing the vessel detection accuracy are the following: different weather conditions affecting sea surface characteristics, the quantity of clouds and haze, solar angle, and imaging sensor characteristics. All these factors bring great variations in the selection of the most suitable method; some still continue to pose unsolved challenges. For higher relevance and wider usage, we suggest that the algorithms for detection and classification should support a variety of targets and meteorological conditions, and ideally also a variety of optical satellite sensors. At least, they should be tested on many images under different conditions. This is not usually the case in the existent literature. We also observed that many authors omit an appropriate performance quantification, which is critical for a practical assessment and a numerical comparison of the presented algorithms. Overall it can be seen that vessel monitoring from spaceborne optical images is a popular research topic and has a great operational potential in the near future due to the large amount of satellite data, much of it free and open.","Ship detection,Sea target detection,Ship classification,Maritime domain awareness,Object recognition,Vessel classification,Optical satellite data,Vessel detection,"
"a drone-based multisensory payload for maritime pollutants detections","2023","Surface floating marine pollution is responsible for a wide range of environmental hazards for marine fauna. Surface sea pollution monitoring is usually carried out by visual inspection from aircrafts or ships. However, human inspection is costly and results can vary from observer to observer. Remote sensing technology is a valid alternative to in situ measurements that can reduce costs and risks compared to in situ missions. In this context, aerial platforms provide a convenient tradeoff between coverage and resolution, both spatial and temporal, compared to ship or satellite based surveys. As well, small, unmanned aircrafts have the potential to be very inexpensive to operate, offer more flexibility of operation, and will benefit from active research on reducing size, weight, and power (SWAP) requirements of various sensors. However, the use of a multisensory system on board a commercial small drone is hard to implement considering that it is desirable to make a system reliable and robust.

"chapter 5 - oil spill remote sensing","2017","Remotesensing for oil spills is reviewed. The technical aspects of sensors are summarized and the benefits and limitations of each sensor are given. The use of visible techniques is ubiquitous; however, it gives only the same results as visible monitoring. Oil has no particular spectral features that would allow for identification among the many possible background interferences. Identification of specific oil types is not possible. Cameras are useful to provide documentation. Infrared (IR) offers some potential as an oil spill sensor. In daytime oil absorbs light and remits a portion of this as thermal energy at temperatures 3–4K above ambient. IR cameras are economical; however, they suffer from problems such as the inability to discriminate oil from interferences on beaches, among weeds, debris or sediment, and under certain lighting conditions. Furthermore, water-in-oil emulsions may not be detected in the infrared, depending on light and sea conditions. The laser fluorosensor is a useful instrument because of its unique capability to identify oil on backgrounds that include water, soil, weeds, ice, and snow. It is the only sensor that can positively discriminate oil on most backgrounds. The laser fluorosensor also allows for positive identification and discrimination between oil types. Radar detects oil on water because oil dampens water-surface capillary waves under low to moderate wave/wind conditions. Radar offers the only potential for large area searches, day/night and foul weather remote sensing. False targets can be as high as 95%. Satellite-borne radar sensors are now extensively used for mapping large spills or assisting in ship and platform discharge monitoring. The only commercial equipment that measures slick thickness is passive microwave.","Oil spill remote sensing,Oil detection,Sensors for oil,"

"temporal context for robust maritime obstacle detection","2022","Robust maritime obstacle detection is essential for fully autonomous unmanned surface vehicles (USVs). The currently widely adopted segmentation-based obstacle detection methods are prone to misclassification of object reflections and sun glitter as obstacles, producing many false positive detections, effectively rendering the methods impractical for USV navigation. However, water-turbulence-induced temporal appearance changes on object reflections are very distinctive from the appearance dynamics of true objects. We harness this property to design WaSR-T, a novel maritime obstacle detection network, that extracts the temporal context from a sequence of recent frames to reduce ambiguity. By learning the local temporal characteristics of object reflection on the water surface, WaSR-T substantially improves obstacle detection accuracy in the presence of reflections and glitter. Compared with existing single-frame methods, WaSR-T reduces the number of false positive detections by 41% overall and by over 53% within the danger zone of the boat, while preserving a high recall, and achieving new state-of-the-art performance on the challenging MODS maritime obstacle detection benchmark.

"robust detection of infrared maritime targets for autonomous navigation","2020","This paper addresses a problem on infrared maritime target detection robustly in various situations. Its main contribution is to improve the infrared maritime target detection accuracy in different backgrounds, for various targets, using multiple infrared wave bands. The accuracy and the computational time of traditional infrared maritime searching systems are improved by our proposed Local Peak Singularity Measurement (LPSM)-Based Image Enhancement and Grayscale Distribution Curve Shift Binarization (GDCSB)-Based Target Segmentation. The first part uses LPSM to quantize the local singularity of each peak. Additionally, an enhancement map (EM) is generated based on the quantitative local singularity. After multiplying the original image by the EM, targets can be enhanced and the background will be suppressed. The second part of GDCSB-Based Target Segmentation calculates the desired threshold by cyclic shift of the grayscale distribution curve (GDC) of the enhanced image. After binarizing the enhanced image, real targets can be segmented from the image background. To verify the proposed algorithm, experiments based on 13,625 infrared maritime images and five comparison algorithms were conducted. Results show that the proposed algorithm has solid performance in strong and weak background clutters, different wave bands, different maritime targets, etc.","image denoising,LPSM,enhancement map,target detection,image background,Feature extraction,multiple infrared wave bands,image enhancement,traditional infrared maritime searching systems,image colour analysis,infrared maritime targets,grayscale distribution curve shift binarization-based target segmentation,marine engineering,quantitative local singularity,robust detection,maritime surveillance,Target tracking,object detection,infrared maritime target detection accuracy,maritime targets,Infrared imaging,maritime images,Image segmentation,correlation methods,clutter,infrared imaging,GDCSB-based target segmentation,Object detection,Surveillance,wave bands,image segmentation,autonomous navigation,local peak singularity measurement-based image enhancement,"

"an analysis of wintertime navigational accidents in the northern baltic sea","2017","Navigational accidents in wintertime conditions occur relatively frequently, yet there is little systematic knowledge available about the circumstances under which these occur. This paper presents an analysis of navigational shipping accidents in the Northern Baltic Sea area which occurred in the period 2007–2013. The analysis is based on an integration of various data sources, aiming to reconstruct the accident conditions based on the best available data sources. Apart from basic accident information from the original accident databases, data from the Automatic Identification System is used to obtain insight in the operation type during which the accident occurred, as well as into other dynamic aspects of the accident scenario. Finally, atmospheric and sea ice data is used to reconstruct the navigational conditions under which the accidents occurred. The analysis aims to provide qualitative insights in patterns and outlier cases in the accidental conditions. Correspondingly, visual data mining is selected as analysis approach, because of its utility in obtaining qualitative knowledge from data sources through a combination of visualization techniques and human interaction with the data. Special attention is given to the strength of evidence of the identified accident patterns. The results are primarily useful for improving risk analyses focusing on oil spill risks in winter conditions and for developing realistic training scenarios for oil spill response operations.","Maritime risk,Maritime safety,Winter navigation operations,Visual data mining,AIS data,Accident data analysis,"
"visual drone detection and tracking for autonomous operation from maritime vessel","2022","To allow incorporation of autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV's/drones) into maritime military operations, it is critical to be able to accurately localize the UAV with respect to the moving maritime vessel during the take-off and landing phases.

The YOLOv5 detector and the OceanPlus tracker have been trained on a custom dataset with good performance in accuracy and processing time. The drone's position with respect to the vessel is estimated by applying stereo triangulation to the centres of the bounding boxes returned by the object detectors and trackers.

The main drawback stays in the restricted power budget provided by navigation satellites. This makes necessary to conceive, define and develop innovative moving target detection techniques specifically tailored for the system under consideration, in order to make this technology a powerful tool for persistent surveillance of sea areas of interest.

"potential-field data in integrated frontier basin geophysics: successes and challenges on australia's continental margin","2015","Offshore frontier sedimentary basins are characterised by a lack of constraining geological and geophysical data. This lack of data is generally the result of deep water (>500 m), difficult geology (volcanics and salt), remoteness and harsh met–ocean conditions. These characteristics present significant challenges to marine surveying, which means that frontier basins tend to be underexplored. With continuing interest in exploration for energy resources in frontier regions, many frontier basins around the world have been the focus of increasingly-sophisticated geophysical studies that integrate a range of methodologies, including those based on potential-field (gravity and magnetic) data. Underexplored frontier basins around Australia's continental margin have received increased attention during the last decade, largely as a result of government-funded programs of precompetitive data acquisition and analysis. The components of this work that have relied heavily on potential-field data include: first-pass depth-to-basement estimation using spectral techniques applied to magnetic data; enhancement of gravity and magnetic images to aid the identification of basin depocentres and to facilitate onshore–offshore geological interpretation of basement structure; multi-scale edge-detection applied to gravity and magnetic data to aid the interpretation of basement structure; 3D forward and stochastic inverse modelling of gravity data to guide seismic interpretation of sediment thickness and basement structure; and using supercomputers for high-resolution, regional-scale 3D inverse modelling of magnetic and gravity data to constrain the physical properties of the crust. Despite the additional insight offered by this work, efforts to understand frontier basins are not without challenges, one of the most fundamental of which is to ensure that non-specialists are not misinterpreting data (e.g. wrongly interpreting artefacts arising from specific processing). The other main challenge in Australian frontier basins arises from a lack of constraints on crustal structure. This leads to significant ambiguity when using gravity data to infer sediment thickness or to understand the nature of basement. This ambiguity could be vastly reduced through the acquisition of seismic refraction data that focuses on imaging crustal structure. Further opportunities exist in using alternative methods for automated depth-to-basement estimation, incorporating process-oriented rather than static potential-field modelling, and in applying 3D forward and inverse gravity and magnetic modelling to other Australian frontier basins.","Frontier basin,Petroleum exploration,Geophysics,Continental margin,"

"lda-mig detectors for maritime targets in nonhomogeneous sea clutter","2023","This article deals with the problem of detecting maritime targets embedded in nonhomogeneous sea clutter, where the limited number of secondary data is available due to the heterogeneity of sea clutter. A class of linear discriminant analysis (LDA)-based matrix information geometry (MIG) detectors is proposed in the supervised scenario. As customary, Hermitian positive-definite (HPD) matrices are used to model the observational sample data, and the clutter covariance matrix of the received dataset is estimated as the geometric mean of the secondary HPD matrices. Given a set of training HPD matrices with class labels, which are elements of a higher dimensional HPD matrix manifold, the LDA manifold projection learns a mapping from the higher dimensional HPD matrix manifold to a lower dimensional one subject to maximum discrimination. In this study, the LDA manifold projection, with the cost function maximizing between-class distance while minimizing within-class distance, is formulated as an optimization problem in the Stiefel manifold. Four robust LDA-MIG detectors corresponding to different geometric measures are proposed. Numerical results based on both simulated radar clutter with interferences and real IPIX radar data show the advantage of the proposed LDA-MIG detectors against their counterparts without using LDA and the state-of-the-art maritime target detection methods in nonhomogeneous sea clutter.","linear discriminant analysis,covariance matrices,geometry,marine radar,secondary HPD matrices,Hermitian positive-definite (HPD) manifold,matrix information geometry (MIG) detectors,radar detection,target detection,radar clutter,Sea measurements,Covariance matrices,simulated radar clutter,Manifolds,Data models,object detection,optimisation,LDA manifold projection,maritime targets,within-class distance,between-class distance,Hermitian positive-definite matrices,matrix information geometry detectors,robust LDA-MIG detectors,clutter,class labels,nonhomogeneous sea clutter,linear discriminant analysis (LDA),Training,higher dimensional HPD matrix manifold,Clutter,observational sample data,clutter covariance matrix,geophysical signal processing,training HPD matrices,learning (artificial intelligence),remote sensing by radar,Detectors,secondary data,oceanographic techniques,"
"robust infrared maritime target detection via anti-jitter spatialâ€“temporal trajectory consistency","2022","When detecting diverse infrared (IR) small maritime targets on complicated scenes, the existing methods get into trouble and unsatisfactory performance. The main reasons are as follows: 1) affected by target characteristics and ambient temperature and so on, both bright and dark targets may exist on IR maritime images in practical application and 2) spatial information and temporal correlation of targets are not fully excavated. To these problems, we propose a robust anti-jitter spatialâ€“temporal trajectory consistency (ASTTC) method, the main idea of which is to improve detection accuracy using single-frame detection followed by multi-frame decision. First, we innovatively design adaptive local gradient variation (ALGV) descriptor, which combines local dissimilarity measure with gradient magnitude distribution to enhance the local contrast for both bright and dark targets so that the suspected targets can be robustly extracted. For multi-frame decision, interframe displacement correction is necessary to eliminate the interference of IR imager motion and vibration for target codeword. We use pyramid optical flow to track feature point extracted by Shi-Tomasi to capture interframe registration coefficients. Then, the target position is corrected in the spatialâ€“temporal domain. Finally, a robust spatialâ€“temporal trajectory descriptor (STTD), which achieves target encoding and target trajectory consistency measurement, is designed to further confirm real targets and eliminate false targets. Experiments conducted on various real IR maritime image sequences demonstrate the applicability and robustness of ASTTC, which performs more satisfactorily than the existing methods in detection accuracy.","target characteristics,Pipelines,Optical imaging,ALGV descriptor,temporal correlation,robust spatial-temporal trajectory descriptor,image motion analysis,Feature extraction,gradient magnitude distribution,small-target detection,STTD,anti-jitter spatialâ€“temporal trajectory consistency (ASTTC),Adaptive local gradient variation (ALGV),Shi-Tomasi,robust infrared maritime target detection,multiframe decision,single-frame detection,robust anti-jitter spatial-temporal trajectory consistency,Target tracking,object detection,feature extraction,target encoding,IR imager motion,local dissimilarity measure,IR maritime image sequences,interframe registration capture,image registration,correlation methods,gradient methods,ASTTC,infrared imaging,Trajectory,image sequences,target trajectory consistency measurement,spatial information,Object detection,Adaptive optics,image capture,adaptive local gradient variation descriptor,"

This work builds on unsupervised learning techniques which provide models for normal traffic behaviour. A methodology to associate tracks to the derived traffic model is then presented. This is done by the pre-extraction of contextual information as the baseline patterns of life (i.e., routes) in the area under investigation. In addition to a brief description of the approach to derive the routes, their characterization and representation is presented in support of exploitable knowledge to classify anomalies. A hierarchical reasoning is proposed where new tracks are first associated to existing routes based on their positional information only and â€œoff-routeâ€ vesselsâ€ are detected.

"seaâ€“land segmentation in maritime surveillance radars via k-nearest neighbor classifier","2020","Shipborne or airborne maritime surveillance radars at scan mode work at a complex scene consisting of land, sea, and islands. Sea-land segmentation provides a two-class classification of sea clutter versus ground clutter to the surveillance scene as a precondition of adaptive target detection. It is a difficult problem because only a few coherent pulses are available at scan mode. Moreover, due to moving radar platforms and wide dynamic range of ground and sea clutter in power, average amplitude, Doppler offset, and initial phase of radar, the returns vector fails to distinguish sea clutter and ground clutter. In this article, a similarity measure of two radar returns vectors, which is invariant to amplitude, Doppler offset, and initial phase, is constructed, which is closely relevant to the Doppler bandwidth of a returns vector. Based on the similarity measure, a K-nearest neighbor classifier is proposed to yield a pixel-level sea-land segmentation of the scene. Further, the morphological filtering is operated on the pixel-level segmentation to obtain a region-level segmentation. Moreover, the discrete FrÃ©chet distances of the main boundaries in successive scan periods are used to assess segmentation quality. The proposed method is verified by measured data from an airborne radar and an island-based radar. The results show that it behaves better than the methods using thresholding phase linearity degree of radar returns and the support vector machine, and back propagation neural network in a three-dimensional feature space.","airborne radar,K-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier,region-level segmentation,K-nearest neighbor classifier,radar platforms,seaâ€“land segmentation,marine radar,island-based radar,K,Radar antennas,radar detection,complex scene,radar clutter,pixel-level sea-land segmentation,returns vector,ground clutter,pixel-level segmentation,scan mode work,sea clutter,geophysical image processing,support vector machines,similarity measure,object detection,feature extraction,search radar,radar imaging,Doppler effect,Radar clutter,Doppler,Doppler bandwidth,Doppler radar,Clutter,Discrete FrÃ©chet distance,surveillance scene,airborne maritime surveillance radars,radar returns vectors,morphological filter,Surveillance,image segmentation,remote sensing by radar,segmentation quality,oceanographic techniques,"

In this paper, a systematic methodology is proposed to detect possible collision scenarios and identify the distributions of collision risk Hot-Spots in a given area. A dynamic ship domain model that considers the preferences of navigators with respect to the distance passing with other ships before and after the collision avoidance action is first built as the basis of conflict detection modelling. Then a ship domain-based conflict severity model is established to evaluate the risk levels of ships being involved in dangerous encounters. The spatial-temporal pattern mining methods are subsequently extended to identify collision risk Hot-Spots and analyze the collision risk cluster features with time of day. A case study is finally performed using the real AIS data in Ningbo-Zhoushan Port area. Results indicate that combining spatial-temporal pattern mining with collision candidate detection is a useful means to identify where the Hot-Spots are and how the risk is distributed in terms of space and time.","Ship domain,Maritime safety,Traffic conflict,Collision risk visualization,AIS data,"

"bernoulli multi-target track-before-detect for maritime radar","2020","Detection and tracking of small maritime targets using high resolution radar is a challenging problem due to the temporally and spatially varying nature of the sea surface and the spiky returns which can resemble targets. The traditional approach to radar data processing is to first detect targets using their amplitude information (by comparing the radar returns to a suitably chosen threshold) and then feed the extracted (point) measurements into a target tracking system. An alternative approach which can be exploited to improve tracking of weak targets is to process the raw radar data directly though use of a track before detect (TBD) algorithm. This paper presents the development of a multi-target TBD algorithm for maritime radar with targets that are both widely separated and also closely spaced.

"image-consistent detection of road anomalies as unpredictable patches","2023","We propose a novel method for anomaly detection primarily aiming at autonomous driving. The design of the method, called DaCUP (Detection of anomalies as Consistent Unpredictable Patches), is based on two general properties of anomalous objects: an anomaly is (i) not from a class that could be modelled and (ii) it is not similar (in appearance) to non-anomalous objects in the image. To this end, we propose a novel embedding bottleneck in an auto-encoder like architecture that enables modelling of a diverse, multi-modal known class appearance (e.g. road). Secondly, we introduce novel image-conditioned distance features that allow known class identification in a nearest-neighbour manner on-the-fly, greatly increasing its ability to distinguish true and false positives. Lastly, an inpainting module is utilized to model the uniqueness of detected anomalies and significantly reduce false positives by filtering regions that are similar, thus reconstructable from their neighbourhood. We demonstrate that filtering of regions based on their similarity to neighbour regions, using e.g. an inpainting module, is general and can be used with other methods for reduction of false positives. The proposed method is evaluated on several publicly available datasets for road anomaly detection and on a maritime benchmark for obstacle avoidance. The method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both tasks with the same hyper-parameters with no domain specific design.","Benchmark testing,anomalous objects,road anomaly detection,Feature extraction,detection of anomalies as consistent unpredictable patches,Design methodology,Filtering,nearest-neighbour manner,nonanomalous objects,object detection,feature extraction,multimodal known class appearance,inpainting module,autonomous driving,domain specific design,nearest neighbour methods,Roads,image-consistent detection,mobile robots,image restoration,DaCUP,Task analysis,auto-encoder,Algorithms: Image recognition and understanding (object detection,obstacle avoidance,Computer vision,road vehicles,categorization,image-conditioned distance features,class identification,segmentation),"
"visual attention assessment for expert-in-the-loop training in a maritime operation simulator","2020","Improving the training programs for maritime operations is beneficial to enhance the maritime safety in practice. In this article, we propose a novel approach to the assessment of visual attention in a maritime operation so as to support an expert-in-the-loop training program. Experts' knowledge of maritime operation and experiences in the simulator are incorporated into the training program in three ways. First, through a questionnaire, information about task division, identification of critical operation, and definitions of areas of interest (AOIs) are incorporated as prior knowledge for modeling visual attention. Second, a weight scale factor that emphasizes the high importance of visual focus in critical operations is utilized to generate an operations-dependent attention map. Third, based on an expert's attention map and visual switch between AOIs, a similarity metric is designed as a comprehensive evaluation between saliency and visual transition. A case study of heavy lifting operation is performed by two groups of trainees who have received different briefings about â€œcritical operation.â€ The assessment result shows that the group with more detailed briefing obtains a 6% similarity score higher than the other group, which is consistent with the debriefing result of a superior performance of that group.

This article presents a method for deriving the bottom albedo from the TM in coastal waters. Our study of historical TM images shows degradation of the sensor through time. Pattern noise in the imagery in Bands 2 and 3 was analyzed and removed using a combination of Fourier filtering and edge-detection techniques. Noise was first examined over clear and deep nearby oceanic waters, and the filter algorithms developed there were applied to the entire image. To estimate water-leaving radiance from the satellite sensor, Rayleigh and aerosol path radiance were removed. Radiance due to aerosol scattering was calculated for offshore pixels assuming a marine aerosol type, and it was removed as a constant from the entire scene. The TM sensor calibration was validated by comparing water-leaving radiance values over the clear waters of the Florida current with known, normalized water-leaving radiance values. Corrections for water path radiance and water-column attenuation of bottom-reflected radiance were made for regions of known depth, allowing the bottom albedo and vegetative pixel fraction to be determined for shallow reef areas in the Florida Keys.",""
"improved denoising autoencoder for maritime image denoising and semantic segmentation of usv","2020","Unmanned surface vehicle (USV) is currently a hot research topic in maritime communication network (MCN), where de-noising and semantic segmentation of maritime images taken by USV have been rarely studied.

"sensor information fusion architecture for virtual maritime environment","2012","This paper presents a ongoing research on generic sensor fusion architecture and its application to a maritime surveillance system. The importance of information fusion for various sensor types and specialized sensor fusion systems in various domains are discussed. In sensor fusion, centralized versus decentralized refers to where the fusion of the data occurs. In centralized fusion, the clients simply forward all of the data to a central location, and some entity at the central location is responsible for correlating and fusing the data. In this research we intend to correlate multiple maritime sensors such as RADAR, AIS, and other electronic object detection systems. Sri Lanka Navy has myriad of surveillance information sources such as AIS (Automatic Identification System), RADAR (Radio Aid Detection and Ranging), SONAR (Sound Navigation and Ranging), MSTT, HFSWR, AVL (Automatic Vessel Locating), HF Communication, Intelligence Data ect. So it is obvious that an information fusion methodology is needed to harness the effectiveness of multiple sensor information. An object identification pipeline is conceptualized such that an unknown object in the maritime domain is detected reducing the uncertainty of obtained information. The radical new virtual reality application has been developed to visualize the information fused from sensors and discussed in depth in addition to the introduction of the fusion process.

"location estimation in a maritime environment using a monocular camera","2014","Maritime surveillance is a very important task in coastal areas, especially in harbour environments. The most popular such systems include components like Automatic Identification System (AIS) and Radar. Camera based visual surveillance can be used as an alternative to these systems in order to overcome the lacking features of them. Sea surface object detection and identification is a major need for such visual surveillance systems. Most of the current visual surveillance systems don't have the ability of identifying vessels in real time. A vessel can be identified using information from other systems, if the location of the vessel is identified. Location estimation of sea surface objects is mainly explored in this research. Video stream from a single geo stationary camera is used as the input; however camera properties are not used for any calculation. Mainly two distance measurements are considered and different approaches for estimating the distances are explored. Neural network approach gave considerably accurate results in vertical distance estimation and it was found that the shortest distance from camera to the object can be measured best using B-spline 3D curve fitting. Data taken from AIS is used for fitting curves and training neural network. After calculating distances, latitudes and longitudes are calculated.

"belief modeling for maritime surveillance","2009","In maritime surveillance, the volume of information to be processed is very large and there is a great deal of uncertainty about the data. There are many vessels at sea at every point in time, and the vast majority of them pose no threat to security. Sifting through all of the benign activity to find unusual activities is a difficult problem. The problem is made even more difficult by the fact that the available data about vessel activities is both incomplete and inconsistent. In order to manage this uncertainty, automated anomaly detection software can be very useful in the early detection of threats to security. This paper introduces a high-level architecture for an anomaly detection system based on a formal model of beliefs with respect to each entity in some domain of interest. In this framework, the system has beliefs about the intentions of each vessel in the maritime domain. If the vessel behaves in an unexpected manner, these intentions are revised and a human operations centre worker is notified. This approach is flexible, scalable, and easily manages inconsistent information. Moreover, the approach has the pragmatic advantage that it uses expert information to inform decision making, but the required information is easily obtained through simple ranking exercises.","surveillance,Anomaly detection,automated anomaly detection software,Marine vehicles,Monitoring,security of data,Decision making,Information security,data uncertainty,belief modeling,Application software,marine engineering,maritime surveillance,Humans,Radar tracking,decision making,high-level architecture,belief revision,Uncertainty,Surveillance,Data security,"

Oil spills from the heavy ship traffic, one of the major risks, can be detected by satellite remote sensing technologies. In this study, it is aimed to show spatial characteristics of oil spills as well as its dynamics in the time domain of the bay. Results from a three year period of the study show that as a main environmental problem, oil pollution has a relatively high percentage of spatial distribution in the bay. It is therefore concluded that regular monitoring of the intense oil pollution in the bay is required with an agile and low-cost method of satellite monitoring to intervene in good time and to minimize its impacts. The study provided an extensive understanding of spatio-temporal dynamics of oil pollution in the bay.

"ship behavior recognition based on infrared video analysis in a maritime environment","2015","In order to improve the monitoring capability of officer on watch for the environment around the own ship, cover the shortage of RADAR and AIS in ship behavior recognition field, this paper proposes a ship behavior recognition algorithm based on video analysis. After analyzing the ship behavior we found that the silhouette's size and shape variation of ship in infrared image were related to its behavior over a period of time, that is to say when the distance between the own ship and the target ship has decreased during this period, its silhouette's size would increase. And when the target ship is heading toward the own ship directly and the distance between them has decreased (the DCPA (Distance to Closest Point of Approach) is very small, and the TCPA (Time to Closest Point of Approach) is decreasing), the silhouette's size of the target ship would enlarge, nevertheless, its silhouette's shape would have no significant changes. According to these characteristics of ship behavior, the height of target ship's silhouette is used to represent silhouette's size and the ratio between the width and the height of the target ship's silhouette is used to represent silhouette's shape in the ship behavior recognition algorithm we proposed. And then the least square method is used to fit the height and the ratio into straight line during this period respectively, whose slope reflects the changing trend and variation of target ship's silhouette. At last, the recognition algorithm was verified by analyzing infrared video in a maritime environment, which shows that the characteristic of ship behavior summarized by this paper is correct and the recognition algorithm based on them is feasible.","Time to Closest Point of Approach,Cameras,Marine vehicles,Character recognition,intelligent recognition,ship behavior,Target recognition,ships,maritime surveillance,Image recognition,DCPA,Shape,least squares approximations,video analysis,Radar,infrared image,target ship,video signal processing,ship behavior recognition algorithm,TCPA,infrared imaging,maritime environment,marine communication,least square method,infrared video,Distance to Closest Point of Approach,object recognition,"

Calculation of the measured data shows that, the Hurst exponent of the sea clutter with targets and the sea clutter without targets are different, which enables us to detect low-observable targets within the sea clutter. This paper explains the reason why the Hurst exponent can distinguish the presence or absence of targets in theory and proposes a fractal detector based on the Hurst exponent. Comparing the fractal detector proposed in this paper to the energy detector by the detection results of 140 frames data of the real sea clutter, it is demonstrated that the fractal detection method has a better detection performance.

The methodology is applied to needs arising from the field of Arctic maritime safety and security, in order to provide a roadmap for an ongoing multi-national European Union (EU) funded research project. A needs hierarchy containing topics, needs and sub-needs is first formed by utilization of multiple sources including facilitated stakeholder workshops, literature review and semi-structured questionnaires. A further round of stakeholder opinion is then sought in order to ascertain the importance and level of challenge involved in solving each identified sub-need. This information is utilized to form a PICK (Possible, Implement, Challenge, Keep Back) chart in order to visualize and categorize the sub-needs. A goal programming knapsack model is formulated to select a set of priority needs that satisfy goals relating to the maximization of overall importance, the balance between topics at the first level of the need hierarchy and the balance between more challenge (for longer term research) and implement (for shorter term implementation) needs. Sensitivity analysis is conducted around the number of chosen projects and the goal programming weights.

"video processing from electro-optical sensors for object detection and tracking in a maritime environment: a survey","2017","We present a survey on maritime object detection and tracking approaches, which are essential for the development of a navigational system for autonomous ships. The electro-optical (EO) sensor considered here is a video camera that operates in the visible or the infrared spectra, which conventionally complements radar and sonar for situational awareness at sea and has demonstrated its effectiveness over the last few years. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of various approaches of video processing for object detection and tracking in the maritime environment. We follow an approach-based taxonomy wherein the advantages and limitations of each approach are compared. The object detection system consists of the following modules: horizon detection, static background subtraction, and foreground segmentation. Each of these has been studied extensively in maritime situations and has been shown to be challenging due to the presence of background motion especially due to waves and wakes. The key processes involved in object tracking include video frame registration, dynamic background subtraction, and the object tracking algorithm itself. The challenges for robust tracking arise due to camera motion, dynamic background, and low contrast of tracked object, possibly due to environmental degradation. The survey also discusses multisensor approaches and commercial maritime systems that use EO sensors. The survey also highlights methods from computer vision research, which hold promise to perform well in maritime EO data processing.

"tracing illegal oil discharges from vessels using sar and ais in bohai sea of china","2021","In China's 14th Five-Year Plan, it is necessary to coordinate the promotion of marine ecological protection and prevent environmental risks such as marine oil spills. The illegal discharge of oily waste from ships is an important source of oil spill pollution in the Bohai Sea, and has become an important factor hindering the purification of the marine environment. Because SAR remote sensing is not restricted by light conditions, it can work at night, in heavy fog, overcast and rainy days, and has become one of the important techniques for monitoring oil spills on the sea. AIS can provide real-time and historical position and track information of ships. The combination of SAR and AIS can provide a great help for maritime regulatory authorities to find the source of oil spill pollution. However, China has not yet established a mature and effective oil spill supervision system based on SAR and AIS. This paper proposes a framework for oil spill detection and accountability using the combination of SAR, AIS and boarding inspection, and takes an example of the monitoring and tracking process of illegal oil discharge from a ship in the Bohai Sea. As far as we know, this is the first time that China has used SAR and AIS to identify ships that illegally discharge oily sewage. This work framework can provide a reference for China's maritime agencies to improve the oil spill supervision system during the 14th Five-Year Plan.","Synthetic aperture radar,Illegal discharge,Automatic identification system,Oil spill,"

In particular, ship detection is recognized as one of the core research issues of these IoT-driven intelligent marine surveillance systems. Traditional methods based on machine learning have made some achievements in detection tasks for specific objects. However, the ship objects are relatively small, and they are usually not accurately detected.

"autonomous maritime landings for low-cost vtol aerial vehicles","2014","Autonomous landing of quad rotor UAV on a maritime vessel is a challenging task, as low cost sensors, unknown movements of the landing surface, and external disturbances make it difficult to generate a relative pose estimate with sufficient accuracy for landing.

The final landing sequence is performed entirely in the body-fixed inertial frame so that noisy measurements from the GPS and magnetometer sensors do not degrade the relative estimation accuracy.

"maritime object segmentation using dynamic background modeling and shadow suppression","2016","Moving object segmentation in maritime domain is a challenging task due to the various real time practical problems, such as waves on the water surface, boat wakes and weather issues (such as bright sun, fog and heavy rain). These problems contribute to generate a highly dynamic background, gradual and sudden illumination changes, camera jitter, shadows and reflections that can provoke false detections. To deal with above issues, in this paper a fast and robust moving object segmentation method on a water surface for maritime surveillance using dynamic background modeling and shadow suppression (OSDBMSS) in the complex wavelet domain is proposed. For dynamic background modeling, we have used frame difference, background registration, background difference and background difference mask in the complex wavelet domain. For shadow detection and removal, we exploit the high frequency subband in the complex wavelet domain. A comparative analysis of the proposed method is presented both qualitatively and quantitatively with other standard methods available in the literature for publicly available datasets of videos in different maritime scenarios, with varying light and weather conditions. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method is performing better in comparison to other standard methods for all the test cases.","moving object segmentation,change and shadow detection,complex wavelet domain,dynamic background modeling,maritime video surveillance,"
"on the remote estimation of ulva prolifera areal coverage and biomass","2019","Since the outbreak of a large-scale Ulva prolifera bloom in the Yellow Sea during the Qingdao Olympic Sailing Competition in summer 2008, Ulva blooms have been a marine hazard every summer. Accurate and timely information on Ulva areal coverage and biomass is of critical importance for governmental responses, decision making, and field studies. Previous studies have shown that satellite remote sensing is the most effective method for this purpose, yet Ulva areal coverage has been estimated in different ways with significantly different results. The objective of this paper is to determine the lower and upper bounds (T0 and T1) of algae-containing pixels in Floating Algae Index images with an objective method that accurately estimates the Ulva areal coverage in individual images, and then converts coverage to biomass using a previously established conversion equation. First, a seawater background image, FAIsw, is constructed to determine T0, which varies for different algae patches. Then, T1 is determined from water tank and in situ measurements as well as radiative transfer simulations to account for different sensor configurations, solar/viewing geometry, and atmospheric conditions. Such determined T1 for MODIS 250-m resolution data is validated using concurrent and collocated 2-m resolution WorldView-2 data. Finally, Ulva areal coverage derived from MODIS data using this method are compared with those from the high-resolution data (OLI/Landsat, WFV/GaoFen-1), with a mean relative difference of 9.6%. Furthermore, an analysis of 17 same-day MODIS/Terra and MODIS/Aqua image pairs shows that large viewing angles, atmospheric turbidity, and sunglint can lead to an underestimation of Ulva coverage of up to 45% under extreme conditions.","Remote sensing,Biomass,Areal coverage,"

"water segmentation with superior guidance and aligned fusion strategy for unmanned surface vehicles in maritime environment","2022","As a mid-level vision task, water segmentation is essential for unmanned surface systems such as to get the sailing area and avoid the floating objects to ensure vehicles safety in maritime environment. However, existing deep learning method of water segmentation has a little weakness on maintaining origin-scale fineness. At the same time, our intuition is that ground truth is a powerful tool for optimizing the global network. In this paper, we give solutions through these two aspects using superior guidance and aligned fusion strategy. Aligned fusion provides symmetric and fine-grained fusion strategy when using encoder-decoder structured network, and superior guidance enforce the segmentation network grasp the discrimination criterion much earlier before output part of the network.

"interval prediction of vessel trajectory based on lower and upper bound estimation and attention-modified lstm with bayesian optimization","2023","Uncertainty prediction of vessel trajectory is essential to enhance maritime situational awareness and traffic safety. Traditional approaches for trajectory prediction face challenges in accurately quantifying uncertainties, thereby limiting effectiveness in decision-making. To address this challenge, we propose a hybrid interval prediction frame of vessel trajectory using the lower and upper bound estimation (LUBE) and attention-modified long short-term memory (LSTM) network with bayesian optimization (BO). Firstly, trajectory data is preprocessed to solve the scale irregularity. Then, a novel trajectory interval prediction model for perceiving the prediction uncertainties is designed based on an advanced attention-modified LSTM with interval prediction capability. Meanwhile, a supervised training strategy with differentiating the interval widths of latitude and longitude is put forward to devise sample labels for training the model. Additionally, a new prediction interval-based objective function is proposed considering the target of maximizing coverage and minimizing width of trajectory interval. The BO algorithm optimizes the weighted parameters in the LSTM network by minimizing the objective function value. Finally, cases from two water areas are implemented to test and verify the proposed method. The results illustrate the superiority of the proposed approach in (1) outperforming other methods used for comparison in both coverage probability and width criteria of prediction interval. (2) quantifying the prediction uncertainty and improving the reliability of trajectory predictor. (3) performing anomaly detection tasks using visualized trajectory prediction intervals. The research can help maritime traffic participants obtain more reliable trajectory data, which supports making more reasonable traffic supervision decisions.","Long short-term memory,Attention mechanism,Vessel trajectory,Lower and upper bound estimation (LUBE),Interval prediction,"
"mkcl: medical knowledge with contrastive learning model for radiology report generation","2023","Automatic radiology report generation has the potential to alert inexperienced radiologists to misdiagnoses or missed diagnoses and improve healthcare delivery efficiency by reducing the documentation workload of radiologists. Motivated by the continuous development of automatic image captioning, more and more deep learning methods have been proposed for automatic radiology report generation. However, the visual and textual data bias problem still face many challenges in the medical domain. Additionally, do not integrate medical knowledge, ignoring the mutual influences between medical findings, and abundant unlabeled medical images influence the accuracy of generating report. In this paper, we propose a Medical Knowledge with Contrastive Learning model (MKCL) to enhance radiology report generation. The proposed model MKCL uses IU Medical Knowledge Graph (IU-MKG) to mine the relationship among medical findings and improve the accuracy of identifying positive diseases findings from radiologic medical images. In particular, we design Knowledge Enhanced Attention (KEA), which integrates the IU-MKG and the extracted chest radiological visual features to alleviate textual data bias. Meanwhile, this paper leverages supervised contrastive learning to relieve radiographic medical images which have not been labeled, and identify abnormalities from images. Experimental results on the public dataset IU X-ray show that our proposed model MKCL outperforms other state-of-the-art report generation methods. Ablation studies also demonstrate that IU medical knowledge graph module and supervised contrastive learning module enhance the ability of the model to detect the abnormal parts and accurately describe the abnormal findings.

"maritime small target detection based on appearance stability and depth-normalized motion saliency in infrared video with dense sunglints","2023","Maritime infrared (IR) small target detection in dense sunglint environments has always been challenging. It is difficult for existing methods to distinguish the small target from dense and strong sea clutter because the sea clutter caused by the sunglints has similar spatialâ€“temporal characteristics to small targets. This article proposes a method based on appearance stability and depth-normalized motion saliency (AS-DNMS) for small target detection in IR videos or sequences. First, on each frame of the IR video, the isotropic salience measure (ISM) based on principal curvature filtering is proposed for target enhancement, and an adaptive threshold is used to extract a stable number of candidate targets. Then, we use improved pipeline filtering to form trajectory chains of the candidate targets extracted from the consecutive frames. To improve the matching accuracy of pipeline filtering, we propose an inverse optical flow method to predict the local images of the candidate targets. Third, the motion vectors of the candidate targets are extracted and depth-normalized. According to the principle of projection perspective, a depth normalization model based on the position of the sea-sky line is established, providing a simple and low-cost solution for acquiring depth information of maritime targets under sea-sky backgrounds. Finally, the appearance stability measure (ASM) and the depth-normalized motion saliency measure (DNMSM) are calculated to construct the AS-DNMS joint feature. A double asymptote decision function is employed to determine the real target. The experimental results show that our method has better detection performance in dense sunglint environments than the baseline methods.","Appearance stability and depth-normalized motion saliency (AS-DNMS),Pipelines,target detection,radar clutter,target enhancement,Sea measurements,IR video,dense sunglint environment,strong sea clutter,isotropic salience measure (ISM),object detection,dense sunglints,feature extraction,maritime targets,Sea surface,improved pipeline filtering,infrared (IR) small target detection,depth-normalized motion saliency measure,dense sunglint environments,depth normalization model,Trajectory,image sequences,Tensors,Clutter,Object detection,appearance stability measure,infrared video,sequences,candidate targets,sea-sky line,isotropic salience measure,pipeline filtering,dense sea clutter,"
"characterisation of a complex maritime scene using fourier space analysis to identify small craft","1999","This paper describes the continuing development of a system, which is able to extract, identify and track maritime vessels. The system first interprets changes in the frequency domain of the image to build a characteristic frequency template that describes the structure of the current sea state. No a priori knowledge of any characteristic frequencies is assumed. The system is given various points within the sea and based on these points builds an average characteristic frequency response, effectively a template of the current sea state. The template is used to remove most of the sea from consecutive image frames, which leaves regions in the image mainly containing maritime vessels. Frame differencing of the frequency processed images is used to generate regions of interest, from which a set of object descriptors are calculated. A tracking algorithm resolves the frame to frame correspondences using a set of motion constraints. Regions that satisfy the constraints are highlighted and tracked. Regions that fail to satisfy the motion constraints are removed and no longer processed.","characteristic frequency template,frequency processed images,tracking algorithm,Fourier space analysis,complex maritime scene,characteristic frequency response,object descriptors,small craft,frame to frame correspondences,sea state,regions of interest,frequency domain,frequency response,maritime vessels,frame differencing,motion constraints,"
"edge computing-enabled multi-sensor data fusion for intelligent surveillance in maritime transportation systems","2022","With the rapid development of navigation technologies, maritime transportation has become one of the mainstream international trade channels. However, a large number of maritime traffic accidents still occur every year, which cause significant economic losses and environmental damage. Intelligent and efficient surveillance in maritime transportation systems is essential for avoiding accidents. This paper proposes an edge computing-enabled multi-sensor data fusion method for intelligent maritime surveillance, which achieves efficient perception of maritime traffic information by receiving and processing visual and Automatic Identification System (AIS) data simultaneously. We first propose an anti-occlusion algorithm for vessel tracking based on visual trajectory analysis to mitigate missing detection caused by overlapping vessels. We then leverage the Hungarian algorithm driven by multidimensional feature analysis to match data collected by different sensors.

"grid size optimization for potential field based maritime anomaly detection","2014","This study focuses on improving the potential field based maritime data modeling method, developed to extract traffic patterns and detect anomalies, in a clear, understandable and informative way. The method's novelty lies in employing the concept of a potential field for AIS vessel tracking data abstraction and maritime traffic representation. Unlike the traditional maritime surveillance equipment, such as radar or GPS, the AIS system comprehensively represents the identity and properties of a vessel, as well as its behavior, thus preserving the effects of navigational decisions, based on the skills of experienced seamen. In the developed data modeling process, every vessel generates potential charges, which value represent the vessel's behavior, and drops the charges at locations it passes. Each AIS report is used to assign a potential charge at the reported vessel positions. The method derives three construction elements, which define, firstly, how charges are accumulated, secondly, how a charge decays over time, and thirdly, in what way the potential is distributed around the source charge. The collection of potential fields represents a model of normal behavior, and vessels not conforming to it are marked as anomalous. In the anomaly detection prototype system STRAND, the sensitivity of anomaly detection can be modified by setting a geographical coordinate grid precision to more dense or coarse. The objective of this study is to identify the optimal grid size for two different conditions – an open sea and a port area case. A noticeable shift can be observed between the results for the open sea and the port area. The plotted detection rates converge towards an optimal ratio for smaller grid sizes in the port area (60-200 meters), than in the open sea case (300-1000 meters). The effective outcome of the potential filed based anomaly detection is filtering out all vessels behaving normally and presenting a set of anomalies, for a subsequent incident analysis using STRAND as an information visualization tool.","maritime traffic,potential field,anomaly detection,AIS,"

"deeptracks: geopositioning maritime vehicles in video acquired from a moving platform","2021","Geopositioning and tracking a moving boat at sea is a very challenging problem, requiring boat detection, matching and estimating its GPS location from imagery with no common features. The problem can be stated as follows: given imagery from a camera mounted on a moving platform with known GPS location as the only valid sensor, we predict the geoposition of a target boat visible in images. Our solution uses recent ML algorithms, the camera-scene geometry and Bayesian filtering. The proposed pipeline first detects and tracks the target boatâ€™s location in the image with the strategy of tracking by detection. This image location is then converted to geoposition to the local sea coordinates referenced to the camera GPS location using plane projective geometry. Finally, target boat local coordinates are transformed to global GPS coordinates to estimate the geoposition. To achieve a smooth geotrajectory, we apply unscented Kalman filter (UKF) which implicitly overcomes small detection errors in the early stages of the pipeline. We tested the performance of our approach using GPS ground truth and show the accuracy and speed of the estimated geopositions.

"detecting anomalous deviations from standard maritime routes using the ornsteinâ€“uhlenbeck process","2018","A novel anomaly detection procedure based on the Ornsteinâ€“Uhlenbeck (OU) mean-reverting stochastic process is presented. The considered anomaly is a vessel that deviates from a planned route, changing its nominal velocity $\boldsymbol{v}_0$. In order to hide this behavior, the vessel switches off its automatic identification system (AIS) device for a time  $T$ and then tries to revert to the previous nominal velocity $\boldsymbol{v}_0$. The decision that has to be made is declaring that a deviation either happened or not, relying only upon two consecutive AIS contacts. Furthermore, the extension to the scenario in which multiple contacts (e.g., radar) are available during the time period $T$ is also considered. A proper statistical hypothesis testing procedure that builds on the changes in the OU process long-term velocity parameter $\boldsymbol{v}_0$ of the vessel is the core of the proposed approach and enables the solution of the anomaly detection problem.

This paper proposed a fusion framework, which takes the visual detection and the automatic identification system (AIS) as inputs to obtain accurate and robust vessel identification to address these challenges. Visual detection uses an innovative method to estimate the distance of the identified vessel target from the camera and the azimuth angle relative to the camera based on the images from the monocular camera. The distance and azimuth angle were further fused with AIS data to obtain the fused output. The test results based on 3976 images show that the mean absolute error of the visual-based distance estimation method is 0.72km. The success rate of visual detection and AIS data association is 75.7%.","deep learning-based vessel classification methods,camera-based vessel identification,deep learning (artificial intelligence),azimuth angle,Cameras,abnormal activity identification purposes,maritime surveillance measures,visual detection,monocular camera,distance estimation,image fusion,automatic identification system,fusion framework,fusion,maritime surveillance,cameras,AIS,object detection,camera-based vessel detection,feature extraction,image classification,visual-based distance estimation method,vessel detection,marine engineering computing,Azimuth,Automation,Visualization,Deep learning,camera surveillance system,Surveillance,image segmentation,marine vehicles,video surveillance,Estimation,AIS data association,"
"wald- and rao-based detection for maritime radar targets in sea clutter with lognormal texture","2022","Non-Gaussian sea clutter causes conventional detectors designed in Gaussian clutter to suffer detection performance degradation, and some nuisance parameters cause the uniformly most powerful test to be unavailable. To improve the detection performance of maritime radar targets, we investigate the design of adaptive detectors in correlated non-Gaussian sea clutter by using suboptimal tests. The non-Gaussian sea clutter is modeled as a product of lognormal-distributed texture and complex Gaussian speckle. Two adaptive radar target detectors are developed by using the suboptimal two-step Wald and Rao tests. Specifically, a nonadaptive detector is derived by the Wald or Rao test when the clutter texture and speckle covariance matrix are assumed to be known in the first step; then the clutter parameters known in the first step are estimated, and the true parameters of the detector obtained in the first step are replaced with the estimated values. Theoretical proof and experimental verification indicate that the two proposed detectors have the constant false alarm property with regard to the clutter speckle covariance matrix and the clutter average power. Numerical results on simulated and measured radar data show that the proposed Rao-based detector outperforms its competitors and has stronger robustness to the signal mismatch compared to the proposed Wald-based detector.","Wald-based detector,covariance matrices,speckle,marine radar,detection performance degradation,complex Gaussian speckle,Wald test,radar detection,Lognormal texture,radar clutter,clutter texture,Gaussian clutter,adaptive radar,clutter speckle covariance matrix,sea clutter,adaptive detectors,radar targets,Covariance matrices,object detection,adaptive radar target detectors,Rao-based detector,maritime radar targets,Radar clutter,Radar,radar signal processing,clutter average power,Gaussian noise,Clutter,clutter parameters,nonGaussian sea clutter,Rao-based detection,Rao test,Gaussian distribution,Radar detection,Detectors,NonGaussian sea clutter,Speckle,"
"onboard processing concept for maritime surveillance demonstrated with dlrâ€™s airborne radar sensors f-sar and dbfsar","2021","In the paper an onboard processing concept for maritime surveillance applications is proposed. It is suited for airborne platforms and future high-altitude platforms (HAP). The concept uses range-compressed single- and multichannel radar data as input and doesnâ€™t require time consuming synthetic aperture radar (SAR) processing as conventionally needed when it comes to ship detection with spaceborne SAR systems. Small coherent processing intervals (CPIs) are used for detecting and tracking the ships in range-Doppler domain. In addition to the reduced processing requirements, the range-Doppler domain has the advantage that even ships with small radar cross section (RCS) can be detected when they move with a certain line-of-sight velocity so that their signals are shifted in Doppler to the exo-clutter region. In the paper the overall processing concept is briefly discussed and the effectiveness is demonstrated by using real radar data acquired with DLRâ€™s airborne radar sensors F-SAR [1] and DBFSAR [2].",""
"ais event-based knowledge discovery for maritime situational awareness","2016","The discovery of anomalies and, more in general, of events of interest at sea is one of the main challenges of Maritime Situational Awareness. This paper introduces an event-based methodology for knowledge discovery without querying directly a large volume of raw data. The proposed architecture analyses the maritime traffic data to detect maritime traffic patterns and events and aggregate them in an Event Map, namely a georeferenced grid. The Event Map offers visualisation capabilities and, more importantly, is used as access interface to the maritime traffic knowledge database. The proposed methodology offers real-time access to the extracted maritime knowledge, and the possibility to perform more structured queries with respect to traditional basic queries (e. g. vessel proximity within a certain distance). The proposed approach is demonstrated and assessed using real-world Automatic Identification System (AIS) data, revealing computational improvements and enriched monitoring capabilities.","data mining,event detection,anomaly detection,Marine vehicles,Monitoring,data visualisation,data visualisation capabilities,event map,AIS event-based knowledge discovery,maritime situational awareness,data analysis,anomaly discovery,automatic identification system,Knowledge discovery,marine engineering,AIS,maritime surveillance,maritime traffic data analysis,maritime traffic knowledge database,georeferenced grid,Data visualization,Trajectory,Visualization,knowledge discovery,"

"siamfpn: a deep learning method for accurate and real-time maritime ship tracking","2021","Visual object tracking plays an essential role in various maritime applications. However, most of the existing tracking methods belong to generative models, which only focus on the features of the object and require the target has significant visual saliency for accurate tracking. While the visual saliency is available in most of the common tracking conditions, these methods may fail when facing challenging situations. In this paper, a deep learning based tracking method is proposed to track maritime ships, namely, SiamFPN. In SiamFPN, a modified Siamese Network is combined with multi-RPNs to build a tracking pipeline. Concretely, A ResNet-50 with an FPN structure is used as the CNN of the detection subnetwork of Siamese, and a template subnetwork is parallel to the detection. In order to strengthen the discriminative ability, three RPNs are deployed to process the output of Siamese Network. Moreover, a historical impacts based proposal selection method is developed for selecting correct target areas. Finally, a dataset is collected for training and testing SiamFPN and validating our excellent performance over the other four recent SOTA trackers. Based on the experimental results, we achieved 74 % on average accuracy with real-time speed.","modified Siamese Network,region proposal network,Cameras,Marine vehicles,maritime ships,significant visual saliency,proposal selection method,image representation,target tracking,Visual tracking,object tracking,ships,Target tracking,Proposals,object detection,SiamFPN,Radar tracking,Correlation,maritime applications,deep learning based tracking method,maritime environment,common tracking conditions,Visualization,tracking pipeline,existing tracking methods,Siamese network,visual object tracking,correct target areas,learning (artificial intelligence),tracking,"
"a stap detection scheme for low sample support maritime environments","2023","In airborne radar, reduced rank space-time adaptive processing techniques are employed when non-stationarity and non-homogeneity of the clutter causes insufficient sample support. There have been many approaches proposed to address this problem, including principal components, the cross-spectral metric and the multistage Wiener filter. This latter approach is superior to other reduced rank techniques in terms of computational efficiency, sample support and rank requirements. Regarding operation in heterogeneous environments, the single data set approach for clutter suppression has been proposed and operates solely on the cell under test to obtain a clutter covariance estimate. It is therefore highly effective in environments with limited training data that is homogeneous with the test data. In this paper, a single data set detection approach under the framework of the multistage Wiener filter is proposed and analysed to enhance clutter suppression capabilities. The target detection performance of the filter is evaluated using simulated maritime radar data.","Training data,Training,space time adaptive processing,Clutter,Covariance matrices,single data set,Estimation,Detectors,Radar detection,wiener filter,"

In a series of experiments conducted in the Hudson River, we collected and analyzed data from various sensors and evaluated several potential technology solutions for detecting these security threats. The threats are addressed across multiple scenarios, ranging from man-made threats to coastal hazards, using assets including radars; acoustic and infrared sensors; vessels and vehicles; and oceanographic and meteorologic prediction tools focused on the water surface, underwater, and urban environments.

"from unsupervised to semi-supervised anomaly detection methods for hrrp targets","2020","Responding to the challenge of detecting unusual radar targets in a well identified environment, innovative anomaly and novelty detection methods keep emerging in the literature. This work aims at presenting a benchmark gathering common and recently introduced unsupervised anomaly detection (AD) methods, the results being generated using high-resolution range profiles. A semi-supervised AD (SAD) is considered to demonstrate the added value of having a few labeled anomalies to improve performances. Experiments were conducted with and without pollution of the training set with anomalous samples in order to be as close as possible to real operational contexts. The common AD methods composing our baseline will be One-Class Support Vector Machines (OC-SVM), Isolation Forest (IF), Local Outlier Factor (LOF) and a Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE). The more innovative AD methods put forward by this work are Deep Support Vector Data Description (Deep SVDD) and Random Projection Depth (RPD), belonging respectively to deep and shallow AD. The semi-supervised adaptation of Deep SVDD constitutes our SAD method.

"cognitive mimo sonar based robust target detection for harbor and maritime surveillance applications","2009","Robust detection of various hostile threats is vital to protect Navy ships and other facilities within harbor and maritime environments. Traditional single-input single-output (SISO) sonar transmits single acoustic waveform by single projector, which has a few disadvantages including low target detection probability, low resolution, vulnerability of interception by the enemy, sensitivity to jamming, etc. Multi-input multi-output (MIMO), typically applied to communications and radar solutions, is an emerging technology that can be applied to sonar to overcome many of the SISO sonar disadvantages. In this paper, cognitive monostatic/bistatic/multistatic MIMO sonar approaches are proposed. MIMO sonar transmits different orthogonal acoustic waveforms from multiple projectors with different spatial distributions. Through space-time-waveform diversity, MIMO sonar is able to apply coherent processing techniques over the received signals, and acquires more diversity gains. The cognition concept proposed in the literature for radar and wireless communication is applied to MIMO sonar to improve its robustness and adaptability. The advantages of proposed cognitive MIMO sonar will be demonstrated by Monte Carlo computer simulations and compared to the SISO techniques.","MIMO,surveillance,Monte Carlo methods,acoustic waveform,Sonar detection,Sonar applications,Acoustic waves,sonar signal processing,maritime surveillance,object detection,Navy ships,robust target detection,hostile threats,Acoustic signal detection,Protection,Radar,harbor surveillance,Robustness,marine communication,Object detection,SISO sonar,Surveillance,cognitive MIMO sonar,MIMO communication,Monte Carlo computer simulations,"

"data-driven assessment of the survivability and maintainability of offshore renewable energy devices in irelandâ€™s harsh maritime climate","2023","Unobstructed across the vast expanse of the North Atlantic Ocean, the Irish maritime area encompasses some of the worldâ€™s most energy-intensive waves. However, high winds and associated large waves present a substantial engineering challenge to ensure the survivability of offshore renewable energy devices during extreme weather events. Finding adequate weather windows for installation, operation, and maintenance activities is another obstacle when deploying these devices. This paper presents the results of a large-scale analysis of wave and wind data around the coasts of Ireland and Wales. Extreme Value Analysis calculates the expected wave heights and wind speeds for extreme events (1-year, 10-year, 50-year and 100-year return periods). Weather windows are also calculated based on a matrix of wave heights, wind speeds and minimum durations required.

"manifold learning techniques for unsupervised anomaly detection","2018","Appropriately identifying outlier data is a critical requirement in the decision-making process of many expert and intelligent systems deployed in a variety of fields including finance, medicine, and defense. Classical outlier detection schemes typically rely on the assumption that normal/background data of interest are distributed according to an assumed statistical model and search for data that deviate from that assumption. However, it is frequently the case that performance is reduced because the underlying distribution does not follow the assumed model. Manifold learning techniques offer improved performance by learning better models of the background but can be too computationally expensive due to the need to calculate a distance measure between all data points. Here, we study a general framework that allows manifold learning techniques to be used for unsupervised anomaly detection by reducing computational expense via a uniform random sampling of a small fraction of the data. A background manifold is learned from the sample and then an out-of-sample extension is used to project unsampled data into the learned manifold space and construct an anomaly detection statistic based on the prediction error of the learned manifold. The method works well for unsupervised anomaly detection because, by definition, the ratio of anomalous to non-anomalous data points is small and the sampling will be dominated by background points. However, a variety of parameters that affect detection performance are introduced so we use here a low-dimensional toy problem to investigate their effect on the performance of four learning algorithms (kernel PCA, two versions of diffusion map, and the Parzen density estimator). We then apply the methods to the detection of watercraft in an ensemble of 22 infrared maritime scenes where we find kernel PCA to be superior and show that it outperforms a commonly employed baseline algorithm. The framework is not limited to the tested image processing example and can be used for any unsupervised anomaly detection task.","Manifolds,Anomaly detection,Image processing,Manifold learning,Target detection,"

"a novel approach for defect detection on vessel structures using saliency-related features","2018","Seagoing vessels have to undergo regular visual inspections in order to detect defects such as cracks and corrosion before they result into catastrophic consequences. These inspections are currently performed manually by ship surveyors at a great cost, so that any level of assistance during the inspection process by means of e.g. a fleet of robots capable of defect detection would significatively decrease the inspection cost. In this paper, we describe a novel framework for visually detecting the aforementioned defects. This framework is generic and flexible in the sense that it can be easily configured to compute the features that perform better for the inspection at hand. Making use of this framework and inspired by the idea of conspicuity, this work considers contrast and symmetry as features for detecting defects and shows their usefulness for the case of vessels. Three different combination operators are additionally tested in order to merge the information provided by these features and improve the detection performance. Experimental results for different configurations of the detection framework show better classification rates than state of the art methods and prove its usability for images collected by a micro-aerial robotic platform intended for visual inspection.","Saliency,Defect detection,Vessel inspection,Micro-aerial vehicle,Corrosion,Cracks,"
