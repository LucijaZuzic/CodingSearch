"ship anti-grounding with a maritime autonomous surface ship and digital twin of port of hamburg","2023","We present the virtual demonstration of a novel ship Anti-Grounding Service in a digital twinned use case scenario in the Port of Hamburg. The scenario is generated from real bathymetry survey data collected in the Port. The virtual model of a Maritime Autonomous Surface Ship travels the route ahead of merchant ships on approach to the Port and is integrated with a real-time high-resolution Multibeam SONAR Simulator that synthesizes underkeel survey data. The automated data processing workflow detects potential grounding hazards in the synthetic survey data and provides a real-time update of the Port nautical chart, which is presented in the Electronic Chart Display and Information System of a Ship Handling Simulator. Our method is the first to consider Multibeam SONAR equipped Maritime Autonomous Surface Ship platforms for provision of ship Anti-Grounding Services. The results validate the full-scale simulation and automated hazard detection workflow and incorporate tests conducted with certified mariners (N=10) to address human factors of introducing new technologies into safety critical situations. The key contributions of this work are summarized as: 1) Validation of Maritime Autonomous Surface Ships as an Anti-Grounding Service delivery platform; 2) Demonstration of a Digital Twin for hydrography survey and bottom hazard detection; and 3) Experimental validation with certified mariners of the anti-grounding service Human-Computer Interface on the ship bridge.","digital twinned use case scenario,automated data processing workflow,ship antigrounding service,underkeel survey data,electronic chart display,Bridges,human factors,bathymetry survey data,safety,grounding hazards,antigrounding service delivery platform,hydrography,Surveys,digital twins,ships,marine safety,maritime autonomous surface ship platforms,autonomous,port nautical chart,synthetic survey data,Seaports,object detection,automated hazard detection workflow,simulation,digital twin,ship handling simulator,sonar,unmanned vehicle,Autonomous aerial vehicles,bathymetry,Real-time systems,antigrounding service human-computer interface,real-time high-resolution multibeam SONAR simulator,merchant ship,Hazards,hazards,Hamburg port,SONAR,ports,navigation,Digital twins,merchant ships,oceanographic techniques,ship bridge,"
"joint deployment of undersea sensors for enhanced maritime security at perimeters and choke points","2012","The US Coast Guard, US Navy and other maritime and port security units routinely conduct undersea inspections for a variety of mission requirements. However, current inspection techniques only sample a small number of vessels transiting into US waters, resulting in limited situational awareness in the undersea domain and creating an opportunity for introduction of threatening devices into harbors where they can inflict great harm. The Naval Undersea Warfare Center (NUWC) Detachment San Diego, NUWC Division Newport, and Battelle have developed and demonstrated undersea systems that can be combined to address several of these mission requirements in a joint deployment, facilitating more efficient and complete harbor security. This paper will provide an overview of each system component, including hardware descriptions and test results to date, and discuss deployment Concept of Operations (CONOPS) at a candidate location.","system component,undersea inspection,Sonar,underwater equipment,Port security,Sensors,Explosives,Inspection,Joints,military equipment,enhanced maritime security,USA Councils,marine systems,Security,sensor placement,undersea sensors,joint deployment,Naval Undersea Warfare Center,"
"evaluation of the effectiveness of co-processors gpu-based in solving of generating sea waves in the operation simulation model of unmanned maritime vehicles","2023","The article considers the matters of developing the models of the bottom sonar survey applying unmanned surface vehicles. The purpose of the work is the assessment of the efficiency of applying available firmware means to conduct computer-intense calculations when using simulation model. Within the work, the main attention was paid to considering the process of forming the sea surface at various parameters of the environment as one of the most resource-intense in the simulation model from the point of view of computation efforts. It is shown that the whole process of the sea surface forming can be kept to the determined stages. The result of the process of forming is a map of the surface peaks. The sea surface forming process can be performed both in sequential and parallel form, whereat some computing blocks can be performed with use of distributed systems. The work has carried out the estimation of the calculation time in implementing the sequential process on the general-purpose processing units of architecture x86 applying OpenCV library, and also of the parallel process applying Nvidia graphics processing units supported by the CUDA technology. The computational experiments conducted for various general-purpose processing units and graphic processors issued during the period from 2010 to 2021 has shown that the use of graphic computing units allows increasing the speed of performing the stage of the complex values of frequencies amplitudes by 20 times, while in performing the stage of an inverse Fourier transform the speed is increased 3 times at average.","CUDA,Fourier transform,Sea surface,sonar systems,Computational modeling,Atmospheric modeling,unmanned maritime vehicles,Surveys,sea surface,Industries,Surface waves,Graphics,"
"concurrent use of satellite imaging and passive acoustics for maritime domain awareness","2010","The research being conducted in the Center for Secure and Resilient Maritime Commerce (CSR), a DHS National Center of Excellence for Port Security examines some basic science issues and emerging technologies to improve the security of ports and inland waterways, as well as coastal and offshore operations. This research follows a layered approach utilizing above water and underwater surveillance techniques. The investigated layers include satellite-based wide area surveillance; HF Radar systems providing over-the-horizon monitoring; and nearshore and harbor passive acoustic surveillance. Integration of these systems is aimed at achieving vessel detection, classification, identification, and tracking. In this paper, we present the results of sea tests where satellite imagery was combined with concurrent passive acoustic surveillance. The wide area sensing was provided by the University of Miami CSTARS facility's electro-optical (EO) and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite imaging capabilities. Satellites detected the ships using a panchromatic EO sensor FormoSat-2 and SAR from the COSMO-SkyMed constellation. The Stevens Passive Acoustic System was used for detecting sound produced by the same ships that were detected by satellites. Concurrent Satellite - Acoustic measurements provide the following advantages: 1. Increasing the probability of small vessel detection and decreasing false alarms. 2. The joint systems can provide redundant detection and classification in conditions where one of the systems fails. For example, EO satellite imaging does not work at night and in fog and cloudy conditions while acoustic detection has limits during stormy weather due to ambient noise. SAR imaging can detect vessels in all weather, but provides less detail about a specific vessel. 3. Acoustics can provide target classification and bearing and satellites can give target localization and heading. SAR data can be used to estimate vessel speed in some cases. 4. Satellite imaging is helpful for the acoustic detection of an underwater target in cases when satellite information allows separation of surface and underwater targets. 5. Joint measurements provide more data (information) for target classification. Several tests were conducted in New York Harbor, where the satellite images and acoustic signatures of the same boats were recorded. The satellite registered a number of small boats. The small boats were acoustically detected at distances up to 4 km and the signal generated by a passenger ferry was observed at a distance up to 7 km.","Satellites,military radar,Stevens passive acoustic system,CSTARS facility's electro-optical radar,maritime domain awareness,acoustic signature,maritime security,underwater vehicles,DHS National Center of Excellence,acoustic detection,satellite tracking,Acoustic sensing,target tracking,Center for Secure and Resilient Maritime Commerce,Miami University,HF radar systems,synthetic aperture radar,satellite imaging,panchromatic EO sensor,underwater surveillance,port security,radar imaging,vessel detection,optical radar,underwater acoustic communication,New York Harbor,Acoustics,offshore operations,Boats,Sonar equipment,coastal operations,satellite sensing,passive acoustics,acoustic surveillance,Surveillance,FormoSat-2,COSMO-SkyMed constellation,Security,target classification,"
"the lama system: a “smart” magnetometer network for harbour protection","2022","This work describes the development of an underwater anti-intrusion system based on a magnetometer self-informed network, whose purpose is to detect the presence of threats in the proximity of critical infrastructures (e.g, terrorist divers in harbours). In this context, the magnetic network fills the gaps of sonar systems at the critical boundaries of the water volume to be controlled (sea bed, docks, …), where acoustic performances deteriorate due to reflections and attenuations. The system operates in a port-protection scenario, characterized by a medium-high environmental magnetic noise that can hide the diver signal (a diver is a weak, quasi-point-like, moving source). The magnetometer network processes two inputs: the environmental magnetic noise and a signal including the target magnetic signal superimposed to the same noise; the frequencies of a diver signal lie within the noise band, hence frequency filtering proves inadequate for noise removal. The basic idea underlying the system is to measure and use the noise itself to filter the overall signal; measuring noise supports a background-subtraction process that allows to extract the target signal and therefore detect the threat presence. The effectiveness of the procedure depends on the positions of magnetometers: sensors must be close enough to one another to measure the common background noise, and, at the same time, should be distant enough from one another so that just one sensor can measure the target signal. To generate alarms when a threat is detected, a real-time software application processes data and activates a visual and acoustic alarm upon identification of a magnetic anomaly. Sea trials carried out in port areas provided extremely satisfactory results in the detection of intruders. The paper presents experimental results obtained during the method validation tests, when intruders were moving in the surrounding undersea environment.","Environmental magnetism,Marine geophysics,Time series analysis,Magnetic anomaly detection,Underwater magnetic systems,Harbour protection,"
"volcanic and tectonic features of shirahama bank in the northern ryukyu arc: implications for cross-arc volcanism controlled by arc-parallel extension","2021","This paper presents volcanic and tectonic features of Shirahama Bank, an unexplored shallow submarine edifice in the northern Ryukyu Arc which was previously poorly mapped, and consequently the nature of its volcanism and tectonism have been poorly understood. New high-resolution (5 m) bathymetry revealed that Shirahama Bank has small volcanic edifices and depressions on its flat top with water depths of 60–150 m. The edifices have pointy summits with steep slopes greater than 30°. Within the depressions, a total of 59 acoustic bubble plumes were detected by shipboard multibeam sonar, suggesting that active volcanic degassing occurs in this region. The bank is dissected entirely by NW–SE to WNW–ESE trending lineaments while the volcanic edifices and depressions on the flat top are undissected. Shirahama Bank was formed by multiple-stages of volcanism. The youngest volcanic stage probably occurred after surface erosion by sea-level low-stand during the late Pleistocene and after tectonic deformation, providing a constraint on the timing of Quaternary volcanism in the northern Ryukyu Arc. Structural control of arc volcanism in the area is observed. The NW–SE to WNW–ESE lineaments identified on and around Shirahama Bank are interpreted as normal faults and form cross-arc graben structures. The young volcanic structures and active bubble plumes at Shirahama Bank and surrounding areas are concentrated within these cross-arc grabens, suggesting that the most recent volcanism is controlled by ~NE–SW extension (arc-parallel or along-arc extension) in the northern Ryukyu Arc. Our results, combined with previous studies, suggest that arc-parallel extension, which differs from the previously known back-arc extension in the Okinawa Trough, plays an important role in arc volcanism during its initial stages.","Ryukyu Arc,Bubble plume,Arc-parallel extension,Cross-arc volcanism,"
"a hybrid robotic network for maritime situational awareness: results from the infore22 sea trial","2022","In this paper we describe an integrated system for maritime situational awareness (MSA) applications, built on a cooperative autonomous robotic network, and developed in the maritime use case of the INFORE EU H2020 project. INFORE project developed an interactive, real-time, extreme-scale analytics and forecasting system for handling and analysing massive streams of data. The MSA INFORE system exploits the synergy between global view (AIS data, ESA Sentinel satellite data), which provide contextual information over a wide area, and local view produced by a sensorised hybrid robotic network. Such a network was validated during the INFORE22 sea trial, held off the coast of Portovenere, Italy, in the Gulf of La Spezia, in February-March 2022. It was composed of a thermal camera and of two autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) equipped with passive sonars. The robots fused their measurements, and cooperatively adapted their navigation for localising a suspicious vessel, communicating her position to the MSA INFORE platform in real-time. For controlling the robots, we developed a perception layer, based on an occupancy grid map framework, which enabled the fusion of passive sonar bearing-only measurements for target localisation. The perception layer was also the basis for making cooperative decisions to adapt the network spatial configuration for improving mission performance. In this paper we report and discuss results from the INFORE22 trial. These results are one the first demonstrations of how data fusion and cooperative autonomy can increase the performance of a complex robotic network in a passive sonar surveillance mission in a real-world scenario. The INFORE MSA systems paves the way towards the development of complex, integrated MSA systems, which exploit robotic networks, characterised by advanced cooperative autonomy capabilities, for improving the local view picture, and for promptly reacting to the evolving scenario.","cooperative autonomy,robotic networks,surveillance,INFORE project,MSA INFORE platform,Autonomous Surface Vehicles (ASVs),sensor fusion,integrated system,sensorised hybrid robotic network,INFORE22 trial,network spatial configuration,complex robotic network,INFORE MSA systems,data fusion,Sea measurements,underwater vehicles,maritime situational awareness applications,Decision making,INFORE22 sea trial,complex MSA systems,integrated MSA systems,Sonar measurements,Robot sensing systems,passive sonars,interactive time,autonomous underwater vehicles,Maritime Situational Awareness (MSA),Sonar,ESA Sentinel satellite data,INFORE EU H2020 project,perception layer,sonar,passive sonar surveillance mission,Data integration,AIS data,coastal surveillance,mobile robots,forecasting system,Surveillance,extreme-scale analytics,autonomous robotic network,passive sonar bearing-only,Autonomous Underwater Robots (AUVs),oceanographic techniques,"
"insights and guidance for offshore co2 storage monitoring based on the qics, eti mmv, and stemm-ccs projects","2020","Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is a collective term for technologies that allow society to unlock the benefits of energy intensive processes like fertiliser production and combustion of fuels (fossil or biologically sourced) without releasing the CO2 to the atmosphere. Hence, CCS could assist in accelerating decarbonisation while society pursues a just energy transition. This paper aims to summarise the learnings of three research projects that all investigated aspects of marine monitoring for CCS from a CO2 storage operator’s perspective. The QICS (Quantifying and Monitoring Potential Ecosystem Impacts of Geological Carbon Storage), ETI MMV (Energy Technologies Institute Measurement, Monitoring and Verification of CO2 Storage), and STEMM-CCS (Strategies for Environmental Monitoring of Marine CCS) projects collectively represent over twelve years of dedicated research to assess environmental impacts and to develop technologies for detection, location, and quantification of potential leakage from offshore geological storage of CO2. Each project used controlled releases in representative environments to test their methods and technologies. QICS as the first of the three projects, focused on the understanding of sensitivities of the UK marine environment to a potential leak from a CO2 storage complex and tested technologies to detect such emissions. The ETI MMV project brought together research and industry partners to develop and sea trial an operational, integrated and cost-effective marine monitoring system for geological CO2 storage. As a commercial project, these results have never been published before and this paper shares for the first-time insights from this work. In February 2020, STEMM-CCS, completed its quest to test techniques for environmental monitoring over a marine CO2 storage site in the UK North Sea, further improved near seabed leakage characterisation capabilities, and delivered a first marine CCS demonstration level ecological baseline. This paper aims to summarise some of the key insights from the three projects and provides references where available for the interested reader. The key finding of all three projects is that the impacts of small to medium CO2 leakages from large-scale storage are limited and localised. Technology capabilities exist for integrated marine CO2 storage monitoring and their performance has been benchmarked at controlled release trials. Even small leakages of 10−50 L/min can be detected at unknown locations in a large area of interest. Finally, the first important steps towards automated monitoring data analysis have been made, including automated leakage signal detection from Side Scan Sonar data (ETI MMV project) and automated species identification from marine biology images (STEMM-CCS project). Some remaining challenges include missed/false alerts because of large variations in the background signal, the cost of monitoring large areas over long periods, and making real-time decisions based on big data. Continued work to reduce the cost of marine monitoring technologies and advancing automation of data processing and analysis will be important in order to support safe and efficient offshore CCS deployment at large scale.","CCS,Location,Offshore CO2 storage,Regulation,Impact assessment,Quantification,Monitoring,Verification,Detection,Attribution,"
"autonomous inspection of underwater structures","2015","In the future our resource on land will be over exploited. The exploration of new resources in the ocean is in progress. Mining will be done on the bottom of the sea. The sea is also a big source of renewable energy. Off shore wind parks and tide plants are built. Also, the major world trade is handled over sea routes and several big harbors. All this maritime facilities are getting older and there are effects like corrosion or malfunctions. In general, they need to be inspected frequently. For deep sea applications, security reasons and cost reduction autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) will be the first choice. The project “CView” addresses one of these inspection problems, the harbor inspection. But the algorithms, we present in this article can be adapted to many other inspection tasks. One of the main goals in this project is to find cracks or damaged areas at the underwater buildings or to observe critical sections under water with cost effective methods. The platform for developing the guidance algorithms for inspection is the AUV “SeaCat”. This underwater vehicle has a control software system with an user interface for mission planning, a mission control system, a precise navigation system, optimized motor control with an autopilot and sensors for obstacle detection and inspection. For obstacle and inspection target detection, a scanning sonar is used. The sonar images are automatically processed with edge detection and line extraction algorithms to get a simplified environment description, which is used by the guidance methods presented in this article. A pan–tilt enabled sensor head with camera, laser measurement and MBES (Multi Beam Echo Sounder) is used to inspect the detected objects. Additionally, these sensors provide distance information to the inspection object which can be used by the inspection guidance. This article presents methods for inspection using the online information from the vehicle sensors to guide the vehicle efficient and safely. It is also important to handle the interaction between mission planning and execution. During mission planning, the operator will define the type of the inspection object (wall, vessel, sluice, etc.). The algorithms we develop use the information from the mission planning and the online data from the vehicle sensors to guide the vehicle to get the optimal inspection results. Therefore, a precise distance control to the inspection object, collision avoidance and object recognition are needed.","AUV,Underwater,Inspection,Guidance,Autonomous,"
"adaptive mission planning for cooperative autonomous maritime vehicles","2013","This paper addresses the problem of developing an autonomous cooperative multi-vehicle system composed of one simple low-cost unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV) guided by a more capable, sensor-equipped, surface or underwater vehicle. Specifically, in this work we consider a system composed of an autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) able to localize a small-sized UUV via a multibeam sonar and, then, to guide it via an acoustic link to reach a target. The UUV is equipped with low-cost navigation sensors (a compass and a depth sensor), and to estimate its own position relies on the data received by the ASV (range and bearing from the ASV and ASV position). This paradigm was applied in the domain of mine countermeasures (MCM) to realize the NATO CMRE Autonomous Mine Neutralization System. In this system the low-cost feature of the UUV is of the most importance since the UUV is supposed to be expendable. In this approach, however, there may be cases in which the underwater vehicle cannot be detected by the sonar for extended time periods causing drifts in the UUV position estimate, potentially compromising the mission. This paper presents a set of behaviors to address this situation. The behaviors coordinate ASV circular search patterns together with sending to the UUV purposely generated navigation updates. The aim is to limit the distance between the two vehicles, increasing the probability of sonar reacquisition, and at the same time ensuring that the UUV progresses toward the target. Results from sea trials held in Elba island (Italy) during ANT12 experiments (in June 2012) are reported, and demonstrate the approach is effective and can push our system toward full autonomy.","autonomous cooperative multivehicle system,mine countermeasures domain,low-cost navigation sensors,ANT12 experiments,multi-robot systems,control engineering computing,small-sized UUV,NATO CMRE Autonomous Mine Neutralization System,ASV position bearing,Elba island,Italy,Sonar navigation,navigation updates,Vehicles,sonar reacquisition probability,autonomous surface vehicle,Three-dimensional displays,software architecture,adaptive mission planning,autonomous underwater vehicles,simple low-cost unmanned underwater vehicle,time periods,ASV circular search patterns,compass,Sonar,vehicle distance,sensors,sonar,multibeam sonar,Acoustics,depth sensor,path planning,cooperative autonomous maritime vehicles,ASV,mobile robots,MCM domain,Sensors,ASV position range,acoustic link,sensor position estimation,"

"keynote: multi-domain situational awareness - from the underwater to the space domain to improve maritime surveillance","2022","Modern surveillance systems require to integrate coherently all available sources of information to compose an operational picture that is as complete as possible. While in the past surveillance had suffered from a lack of data, current technology transformed the problem into one of an overabundance of information, leading to an extreme need for automated analysis. Indeed, current surveillance sensors generate volumes of data that would have been unthinkable only a few years ago. Therefore, all the processing, algorithm calibration, parameter tuning, etc., need to be executed as much automatically as possible. This also requires novel paradigms for algorithmic design. In this respect, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Data Fusion (DF) offer an unprecedented opportunity to strengthen the technological edge; however, the risk is to elevate, at the same time, the speed of the threats we face. Indeed, the surveillance task is complicated by the diversification of threats, whose nature and origin is most often unknown. AI and DF techniques have the potential to identify patterns emerging within these very large datasets, fused from a variety of sources and generated from monitoring wide areas on a day-to-day basis, and use the learned knowledge to anticipate the possible evolution(s) of the operational picture. The presentation will focus on both real-world scenarios and theoretical models, spanning from the underwater to the space domain, including the analysis of scenarios with heterogeneous surveillance sensors (such as radar, sonar and satellite).

"a new efficient wave model for maritime training simulator","2001","The market for maritime training simulators is as important as the market for aeronautical training simulators. Many maritime accidents are caused by piloting errors in critical situations. Such situations are usually due to the environment (waves and streams). Hence, the main challenge of a maritime simulator is to simulate this environment as accurately as possible and, more precisely, to simulate ocean waves. Nowadays, two kinds of wave simulation theories are being presented. Firstly, accurate models are being created by physicists, while in computer graphics, researchers are putting forward some simpler physically-based models in order to produce static photorealistic images.

"low-observable maritime tracking using monte carlo markov chain methods","1996","Kirubarajan and Bar-Shalom (see IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems, 1996) addressed an example tracking problem which is illustrated. At 30 second intervals, bearing measurements are made from a target which is assumed to be travelling in a straight line at constant (unknown) speed; these bearing measurements are subject to errors with a Gaussian distribution. The bearing measurements are illustrated. The task is to estimate the target track on the basis of the bearing measurements alone. Observability is already compromised in this scenario because of the absence of any range measurements, and the use of only a single bearing sensor. The problem is compounded by the fact that the target yields a very low signal/noise ratio, so that in each sonar scan, the bearing contact (if any) deriving from the target is mixed with numerous false alarms due to noise. We present our interim findings in tackling the same problem from a Bayesian statistical standpoint, using Monte Carlo Markov chain methods.","bearing measurements,false alarms,very low signal/noise ratio,single bearing sensor,measurement errors,Sonar tracking,sonar tracking,bearing contact,Bayesian statistics,Monte Carlo Markov chain methods,Gaussian distribution,target track estimation,sonar scan,low observable maritime tracking,"

"treat noise as domain shift: noise feature disentanglement for underwater perception and maritime surveys in side-scan sonar images","2023","In underwater perception and maritime surveys, due to the scarcity of training data and perturbation of speckle noise, the detection performance of underwater objects in side-scan sonar (SSS) images is limited. To address these problems, we proposed a noise feature disentanglement YOLO (NFD-YOLO) by combining noise-agnostic features learning and attention mechanism. Firstly, we rethink the speckle noise by treating it as the domain shift between the training dataset and real-measured SSS images and build a domain generalization-based (DG-based) underwater object detection framework. Then, we extend YOLOv5 with a feature manipulation module, a noise-agnostic subnetwork, and an auxiliary noise-biased subnetwork for noise features disentanglement, more biases toward noise-agnostic features and less reliance on noise-biased features in underwater object detection, respectively. Finally, the ACmix attention module is introduced for a more powerful learning capacity and attention to the object areas based on a small dataset. According to the experiment results, the proposed NFD-YOLO achieved 75.1% mean average precision (mAP) in the test domain, which increased by 7.5% than YOLOv5, and 75.7% Â± 0.4% mAP and 77.5% Â± 1.6% mAP for different speckle noise distributions and transfer directions, respectively, which verified its generalization ability and robustness for speckle noise. Therefore, the proposed method can mitigate the effects of speckle noise and provides a new thought to address the speckle noise in underwater object detection with a small dataset, which is of significance and benefits for underwater perception and maritime surveys.","Training,Sonar,Detectors,speckle noise,Feature extraction,Sonar detection,underwater object detection,feature disentanglement,side-scan sonar,attention mechanism,Reverberation,domain generalization,Speckle,"
"seamless and energy-efficient maritime coverage in coordinated 6g spaceâ€“airâ€“sea non-terrestrial networks","2023","Non-terrestrial networks (NTNs), which integrate space and aerial networks with terrestrial systems, are a key area in the emerging sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks. As part of 6G, NTNs must provide pervasive connectivity to a wide range of devices, including smartphones, vehicles, sensors, robots, and maritime users. However, due to the high mobility and deployment of NTNs, managing the space-airâ€“sea (SAS) NTN resources, i.e., energy, power, and channel allocation, is a major challenge. The design of an SAS-NTN for energy-efficient resource allocation is investigated in this study. The goal is to maximize system energy efficiency (EE) by collaboratively optimizing user equipment (UE) association, power control, and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) deployment. Given the limited payloads of UAVs, this work focuses on minimizing the total energy cost of UAVs (trajectory and transmission) while meeting EE requirements. A mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem is proposed, followed by the development of an algorithm to decompose, and solve each problem distributedly. The binary (UE association) and continuous (power, deployment) variables are separated using the Bender decomposition (BD), and then the Dinkelbach algorithm (DA) is used to convert fractional programming into an equivalent solvable form in the subproblem.

"deep sea archaeological survey in the black sea – robotic documentation of 2,500 years of human seafaring","2019","Between 2015 and 2017 the Black Sea Maritime Archaeology Project (Black Sea MAP) discovered and recorded 65 shipwreck sites dating from the 4th Century BC to the 19th Century AD in the Bulgarian Exclusive Economical Zone (EEZ). Using state-of-the-art remotely operated vehicles to survey the seabed, the team captured more than 250,000 high-definition (HD) photographs; hundreds of hours of ultra high-definition (UHD) video together with acoustic bathymetric, laser, side-scan sonar and seismic data. The wrecks were located in depths from 40 to 2200 m – those shipwrecks in the deeper range presented extraordinary archaeological preservation due to the Black Sea's anoxic conditions. This paper will introduce the range of deep-sea optic and acoustic survey techniques to accurately record and create 3D and pseudo 4D models of the shipwrecks. It will focus on a Early 4th Century BC shipwreck demonstrating the project's survey strategy as well as adaptations developed in response to operational conditions; the implementation of deep sea robotics to generate georeferenced high-resolution photogrammetric models and the benefits this has as an on-site, as well as a post-cruise, interpretative tool. It demonstrates that in-theatre acquisition and processing of high-quality datasets is a working reality and has fundamental implications for management as well as the advantages that this brings to the archaeological research process: Firstly, in the creation of spatio-temporal models, i.e., 4D representations of a site pre and post archaeological excavation and secondly, in monitoring such wreck sites, and provides a viable non-intervention tool for the assessment of sites as part of a long-term management strategy. It also shows the value of well-funded collaboration between academia and industry and that deep water archaeology can and must be totally in accordance to the 2011 United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) convention.","Anoxic preservation,Photogrammetry,Shipwrecks,Black sea,Deep sea archaeology,Underwater robotics,"
"tightly coupled, graph-based dvl/imu fusion and decoupled mapping for slam-centric maritime infrastructure inspection","2023","In this article, we address the problem of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM)-centric maritime infrastructure inspection [using unmanned surface vehicles (USVs)] via novel approaches in tightly-coupled, graph-based DVL/IMU fusion and decoupled mapping. As our first contribution, we formalize the preintegration of linear velocity measurements, obtained by a Doppler velocity log (DVL), in combination with angular velocity measurements, obtained by an inertial measurement unit (IMU), as binary factors encoding relative position. To evaluate state estimation improvements imparted by DVL/IMU fusion, we implement our proposed factor within a state-of-the-art, graph-based lidar-visual-inertial (LVI) SLAM system as our second contribution. Accuracy and robustness improvements are demonstrated in simulation by comparing maximum a posteriori pose estimates with and without DVL/IMU fusion against ground truth poses. As our third contribution, we propose a map generation framework for downstream inspection applications decoupled from SLAM. In our framework, volumetric data (captured by sonar, lidar, etc.) is transformed into a common world coordinate frame using extrinsic calibrations and SLAM pose estimates as input. Our framework operates over the complete set of raw volumetric data, whereas SLAM systems (both online and offline) typically operate over a subset of down-sampled volumetric data. To address the processing of additional volumetric data, we present innovations in refined pose correction and staged filtering for user-controlled denoising. We experimentally evaluate our map generation framework against the LVI SLAM system adopted for this study using real-world data and demonstrate improvements to map quality metrics important to inspection.","decoupled mapping,sensor fusion,Inspection,robot vision,unmanned surface vehicles (USVs),SLAM (robots),LVI SLAM system,Sea measurements,Laser radar,Doppler velocity log,SLAM systems,inspection,pose estimation,Simultaneous localization and mapping,angular velocity measurements,inertial measurement unit,graph-based lidar-visual-inertial SLAM system,state estimation,map generation framework,SLAM-centric maritime infrastructure inspection,mapping,Sonar,optical radar,Robustness,map quality metrics,state estimation improvements,unmanned surface vehicles,calibration,Velocity measurement,mobile robots,downstream inspection applications,linear velocity measurements,simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM),velocity measurement,"
"vital electronics, the key to the developing dynamic gis for the baltic or other maritime environments","2010","Dynamic GIS can provide geospatial information in real-time in support of first responses to natural disasters (e.g. flooding on the Baltic ecosystem), man-made disasters (e.g. oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico), and for Search and Rescue (SAR) missions. All these scenarios require the integration between the real time data acquisition and dynamic GIS. The proposed Vital Electronic System for Maritime Applications (SYSTEM) integrates: a land or sea-based Data Center; a 'Mother Ship' (used for sensor deployment and local data collection); and a large number of easily deployed, disposable, intercommunicating, and intelligent 'Floaters' (equipped with task-specific sensors). An embedded Vital Electronics Computer composed of a hierarchical network of a large number of wireless PSoC-based GNODEs (configurable at deployment), forms the core of SYSTEM. The Floaters include both task-specific Sensing-only GNODEs and Aggregation GNODEs dedicated to local data aggregation and global communications tasks. Sensing GNODE may be equipped with submerged sensors (e.g. water temperature, pressure, salinity, acidity, passive acoustic, SONAR), and/or above water sensors (e.g. air temperature, proximity, sound, light, thermal IR, passive RF, RADAR). Aggregation GNODEs provide absolute location (e.g. GPS or other means) and also long-range communications with the 'Mother Ship', a satellite or airborne platform, and/or a land-based data center. Ultimately, the data collected by the system can be integrated with reference GIS data (such as existing terrain and sea-bottom maps, as well as other live information. The composite data should be web-accessible with the appropriate level of security to relevant agencies and other authorized users.

"potential impact of long-life environmental sonobuoys on littoral asw","2009","The focus of military activity has recently shifted from large area engagements to regional conflicts. Consequently, supportive Naval maritime operations have continued to evolve toward littoral warfare in complicated shallow-water, near-shore environments. This evolution requires new sensors, advanced Concept of Operations, and improved data-analysis capabilities, among others. Planning operations in these harsh-environment areas is difficult because accurate predictions of tactical sensor performance depend on detailed knowledge of the local environmental conditions. Tactical mission planning is thus seldom optimal or efficient, often resulting in coverage gaps, increased risk, and reduced mission success. According to a Navy Mission Need Statement, 'Air ASW tactical execution, especially in littoral seas, requires in-situ environmental updates for preflight mission planning. In the conduct of ASW operations, an urgent need for explicit knowledge of environmental variables is required to optimize the effectiveness of operational acoustic sensors, as well as acoustic sensors in development ' The Naval Air Systems Command has considered extended-life environmental sonobuoy concepts to better characterize the littoral environment. Most designs contain a thermistor string to measure ocean temperatures and also hydrophones to measure ambient noise. This type of complex sonobuoy would be more expensive than a traditional single-measurement AXBT but it could provide a more thorough littoral environment assessment. This paper examines the trade-off between increased sensor complexity and improved ASW performance, in terms of cumulative detection probability. Some advantages of an extended-life combined thermistor string/hydrophone approach, compared to AXBTs and tactical hydrophones, are: 1) higher accuracy of the raw data; 2) temporal averaging to smooth out fluctuations; 3) extended area coverage during drift; 4) less chance for surface temperature anomalies (e.g., mixed-layer-depth errors) caused by various electronic and mechanical variability upon impact; 5) opportunities to discover thermal and acoustic feature boundaries during drift; and 6) less need to re-seed thus allowing longer tactical mission times. These advantages are evaluated relative to the following disadvantages: 1) increased cost; 2) potential drift outside the mission area; and 3) need for increased battery life for longer durations. The analysis is tempered by considering how a potential new system might be used. One assumption is that an environmental sampling decision aid is available to determine the minimum number and best initial locations of drifting sensors to meet performance objectives. The November 2007 Requirements Document from the Naval Oceanographic Office states ?Sampling guidance: Development of guidance on the best way to deploy, spatially and temporally, observation systems in order to meet various forecasting, model assimilation, and model evaluation objectives is needed.? Work in this area is reported in this Oceans '09 Conference in a paper entitled ?Uncertainty-based Adaptive AXBT Sampling with SPOTS?, which addresses optimal sampling requirements. For this trade-off analysis, temperature data from watersampling flights in the Sea of Japan off the east coast of Korea were used to simulate expected capability of a long-term drifting thermistor string. Then optimal initial positions for three notional buoys were determined followed by a simulation of drifting positions and data collected over 12 days. Ocean nowcasts were constructed and used to determine acoustic performance of a notional tactical sonobuoy field. The analysis shows that a drifting extended-life thermistor string can provide significant improvement in environmental characterization, tactical planning, and ASW detection performance.","Acoustic measurements,Sea measurements,military systems,Predictive models,Sonar equipment,Sampling methods,Ocean temperature,Noise measurement,littoral ASW,operational acoustic sensors,Thermistors,Temperature measurement,Acoustic sensors,long-life environmental sonobuoys,"

While the UUV sweeps the TA, it gathers sonar data which is communicated back to the main ship via acoustic communications, and via radio frequency (RF) communications by surfacing at the end of a sweep when good communications are predicted. In this study we shown that by placing the most sweeps within the predicted good communication ranges, the information gain rate (IGR) can be maximized, therefore demonstrating the benefits of RF communications prediction capability while performing the survey mission.","information gain rate,maritime environmental conditions,remotely operated vehicles,Sonar detection,Marine vehicles,communications-optimized task planning,underwater vehicles,Radio frequency,sonar data,Atmospheric modeling,radiofrequency communications,Vehicles,ships,maritime survey,target area,acoustic communications,maritime search,sonar,underwater acoustic communication,communication prediction,main ship,unmanned underwater vehicle scheduling,Sensors,UUV,"
"morpho-bathymetric acoustic surveys as a tool for mapping traces of anthropogenic activities on the seafloor: the case study of the taranto area, southern italy","2022","In this study, an investigation procedure for mapping the traces of anthropogenic activities on the seafloor is proposed. Analyses are based on the interpretation of acoustic data (Multibeam Echosounder and Side Scan Sonar) acquired in the Taranto coastal area. Specific GIS tools supported the acoustic data analysis, interpretation, and mapping. These analyses highlighted that the seafloor of both coastal basins included in the investigated area is affected by a high distribution of traces related to different anthropogenic activities such as dredging, shipping, and mussel farming activities. Such kind of traces resulted efficiently detectable from morpho-bathymetric acoustic data. In particular, groove traces resulted highly distributed in both basins, while sunken mussel farm facilities are widely distributed in the Mar Grande basin. The results highlight as acoustic surveys represent a useful tool for orienting effective coastal management actions. This study points out how geophysical surveys support the geo-environmental characterization of highly urbanized coastal sectors.","Multibeam Echosounder,Contaminated coastal sites,Coastal geomorphology,Side Scan Sonar,Mar Grande,Mar Piccolo,"
"4-dimensional virtual aids to navigation for arctic maritime transits","2017","Vast expanses of the Arctic are opening to exploration, natural resource acquisition and even tourism as the sea ice recedes. The setting for this research is between Alaska in the United States and Russia that has been the subject of a recent Port Access Route Study of the Bering Sea, Bering Strait and Chukchi Sea performed by the United States Coast Guard. Few, if any hydrographic surveys to modern standards have been performed in these areas other than along this specific route that was recently surveyed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Due to the large geographic areas involved and a lack of national assets, aids to navigation in the form of buoys, lights and other physical aids do not exist.

Details of this information is not disclosed until the day of the competition, which adds to the challenges. The algorithm for calculating direction where target signal is coming from is time difference of arrival(TDOA).

"maritime vehicle tracking using underwater gliders and particle filters","2016","A major difficulty in tracking unidentified vessels at sea is due to the need to observe large areas for long periods of time for sparsely appearing targets. A possible solution is to use a network of energy efficient underwater gliders that use buoyancy engines and are equipped with sensor array, processing, and communication hardware. Gliders, however, have a limited size and payload which limits the length of their sensor array and the capabilities of their power, processing, and communication modules. This reduces the resolution of measurements that can be collected and processed on board of gliders and be communicated to a fusion center for accurate target tracking. In this work, we propose the use of adaptive compressive sensing and processing to enable accurate target tracking while using low signal acquisition, processing, and communication rates, short sensor array lengths, and simplified sensing and processing hardware hosted on gliders. Moreover, we propose a particle filtering method to fuse data from multiple sensing nodes and process sensor array measurements with non-linear, non-Gaussian relationship to the target state. A simulation based scenario of tracking a single target by four underwater gliders is used to evaluate the effectiveness of the method.","energy efficient underwater gliders,Gaussian relationship,fusion center,Compressed sensing,adaptive compressive sensing,Gliders,underwater gliders,buoyancy engines,underwater vehicles,particle filters,target tracking,communication hardware,single target,Target tracking,particle filtering (numerical methods),maritime vehicle tracking,sensor array measurements,Radar tracking,underwater acoustic communication,Sensor arrays,Sonar equipment,Engines,short sensor array lengths,signal acquisition,communication rates,unidentified vessels,"
"video processing from electro-optical sensors for object detection and tracking in a maritime environment: a survey","2017","We present a survey on maritime object detection and tracking approaches, which are essential for the development of a navigational system for autonomous ships. The electro-optical (EO) sensor considered here is a video camera that operates in the visible or the infrared spectra, which conventionally complements radar and sonar for situational awareness at sea and has demonstrated its effectiveness over the last few years. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of various approaches of video processing for object detection and tracking in the maritime environment. We follow an approach-based taxonomy wherein the advantages and limitations of each approach are compared. The object detection system consists of the following modules: horizon detection, static background subtraction, and foreground segmentation. Each of these has been studied extensively in maritime situations and has been shown to be challenging due to the presence of background motion especially due to waves and wakes. The key processes involved in object tracking include video frame registration, dynamic background subtraction, and the object tracking algorithm itself. The challenges for robust tracking arise due to camera motion, dynamic background, and low contrast of tracked object, possibly due to environmental degradation. The survey also discusses multisensor approaches and commercial maritime systems that use EO sensors. The survey also highlights methods from computer vision research, which hold promise to perform well in maritime EO data processing.

"insights from archaeological analysis and interpretation of marine data sets to inform marine cultural heritage management and planning of wave and tidal energy development for orkney waters and the pentland firth, ne scotland","2014","The Orkney archipelago has a rich heritage that includes the Heart of Neolithic Orkney World Heritage Site, Viking settlements, harbours supplying Hudson's Bay Company ships, and the wartime naval base of Scapa Flow. This rich history has left its mark on the seabed but accurate maps showing the location and character of surviving seabed archaeology do not exist to the same extent as for archaeology on land. ORCA Marine was commissioned by Historic Scotland to work with the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland in interrogating marine data sets to enhance historic environment records of Orkney Waters and the Pentland Firth. These waters were prioritised for their history of maritime activity and to help guide planning and developments in an area highlighted by the Scottish Government for marine renewable energy. A variety of recent and legacy datasets, including wreck databases; sonar data gathered by public sector bodies; aerial photography; seabed cores; Admiralty charts; and local knowledge, were examined for their effectiveness in discovering and interpreting marine cultural heritage cost-effectively. A methodology was developed that enabled marine cultural heritage information to be quickly assimilated within the national and regional inventories for dissemination online. Polygonisation of records resulted in GIS-based shapefiles identifying site extents, and areas of archaeological potential in relation to wrecks, submerged prehistoric landscapes, anchorages and fishing areas. Substantial gaps in data coverage were identified and areas of the seabed have been surveyed at resolutions that are sufficient to detect large upstanding remains such as iron shipwrecks but insufficient to identify smaller archaeological features. Other geophysical datasets have been created at a resolution detailed enough to allow the recognition of smaller anomalies but in some cases processing of the data has removed small anomalies of interest to archaeologists. Intensively used marine areas often contain the most artefactual remains such as historic ports being developed to service the marine renewable industry. Zones of high wave and tidal energy favoured for renewable energy devices include navigation channels and hazards where a large number of wrecks are documented. Transmission cable routes cross deep water where 20th-century wartime losses occurred. Planning and development of infrastructure relating to renewables may also interact with significant built heritage and archaeology on the foreshore and coast edge.",""

"cognitive mimo sonar based robust target detection for harbor and maritime surveillance applications","2009","Robust detection of various hostile threats is vital to protect Navy ships and other facilities within harbor and maritime environments. Traditional single-input single-output (SISO) sonar transmits single acoustic waveform by single projector, which has a few disadvantages including low target detection probability, low resolution, vulnerability of interception by the enemy, sensitivity to jamming, etc. Multi-input multi-output (MIMO), typically applied to communications and radar solutions, is an emerging technology that can be applied to sonar to overcome many of the SISO sonar disadvantages. In this paper, cognitive monostatic/bistatic/multistatic MIMO sonar approaches are proposed. MIMO sonar transmits different orthogonal acoustic waveforms from multiple projectors with different spatial distributions.

"a lightweight approach to simulate a 2d radar coverage for virtual maritime environments","2013","Virtual simulation systems present a cost effective way of training the mariners to navigate a ship in a realistic maritime environment. To offer a better training session, a need arises to model other tools and components as a part of the virtual simulation system, such as radar, sonar and telescope, that are used to navigate a vessel in the real world. Taking a light-weighted approach, we developed a virtual radar coverage for the Vidusayura virtual maritime learning environment. It simulates an actual marine radar, which gathers information of its surroundings from the virtual environment with which a trainee naval officer interacts. The impact and the effectiveness of the virtual radar system, in terms of the trainee, is also analyzed against a real radar simulation system.","Vidusayura virtual maritime learning environment,light-weighted approach,Browsers,virtual reality,marine radar,ship navigation,computer based training,2D radar coverage simulation,Radar,real radar simulation system,Computers,ships,radar computing,virtual radar coverage,virtual simulation systems,virtual maritime environments,maritime simulation,"
"chapter 14 - underwater acoustic measurements and their applications","2017","This chapter is a collection of brief articles on topics in underwater acoustics. It starts with an overview of the complexity of the acoustic signals resulting from installation and operation of renewable energy systems and the efforts required to measure and interpret those signals. This is followed by a discussion of the United Nations' Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organization's Hydro-acoustic sites in strategic locations in the world's oceans and their expertise in understanding low-frequency acoustic noise and the opportunity for researchers to take advantage of continuous recording that in many cases are more than a decade of time. The Characterization of Noise from Ships is both a classic and a modern view of the features of radiated energy from naval vessels. Underwater Soundscapes is a new look at understanding and interpreting noise fields. It is an especially valuable methodology for separating the myriad of oceanic noise sources. Underwater Acoustic Communications provides an introduction to the issues in that field. Underwater Archaeology is an introduction to a fascinating science that benefits greatly from the ability of high-frequency acoustic energy to image in a competitive way with visual means, but over useful ranges, the artifacts of our forebears. Applications of Underwater Acoustics in Polar Environments is very timely, given the renewed interest in these regions due to accessibility caused by global warming. Tank Experiments provides a modern review of ongoing facilities and efforts for cost-effective alternatives to at-sea experiments. Acoustic Positioning at Sea provides an overview of the forcing functions in and on the sea that make the exact position determination a daunting task. Ocean Observing Systems and Ocean Observatories, Oceanographers and Acousticians provides a complete summary of ongoing efforts and a perspective on the long and fruitful relationship between the scientists of both disciplines. Applications of Underwater Acoustics to Military Purposes is a complete, and brief, review of its use in various aspects of Naval Warfare.","Variable depth sonar (VDS),Underwater soundscapes,Polar environments,Underwater archaeology,Naval warfare,Ship noise,Underwater acoustic communications,Acoustic positioning,Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO),SOSUS,Tank experiments,Ocean observatories,"

Several anomalous/salient object detection methods mostly used for natural images are here applied to sonar images. All methods were firstly benchmarked on a 1500 simulated side-scan sonar images dataset. Precision-recall and processing time analysis was conducted in order to choose the best suited method in such controlled conditions. The performance of the best performing detection method was then validated on a 350 real side-scan sonar images dataset.

"sensor information fusion architecture for virtual maritime environment","2012","This paper presents a ongoing research on generic sensor fusion architecture and its application to a maritime surveillance system. The importance of information fusion for various sensor types and specialized sensor fusion systems in various domains are discussed. In sensor fusion, centralized versus decentralized refers to where the fusion of the data occurs. In centralized fusion, the clients simply forward all of the data to a central location, and some entity at the central location is responsible for correlating and fusing the data. In this research we intend to correlate multiple maritime sensors such as RADAR, AIS, and other electronic object detection systems. Sri Lanka Navy has myriad of surveillance information sources such as AIS (Automatic Identification System), RADAR (Radio Aid Detection and Ranging), SONAR (Sound Navigation and Ranging), MSTT, HFSWR, AVL (Automatic Vessel Locating), HF Communication, Intelligence Data ect. So it is obvious that an information fusion methodology is needed to harness the effectiveness of multiple sensor information. An object identification pipeline is conceptualized such that an unknown object in the maritime domain is detected reducing the uncertainty of obtained information. The radical new virtual reality application has been developed to visualize the information fused from sensors and discussed in depth in addition to the introduction of the fusion process. The technologies used in developing the virtual world and incorporating the real time information in to the virtual world is presented in simplified modal for the purpose of clarity. Also design aspects and some experimental analysis developed in an applied project at the Sri Lanka Navy intended to demonstrate fusion technologies in this environment through an operative prototype are presented.","object identification pipeline,sensor fusion,virtual reality,virtual reality application,maritime sensor,operative prototype,Solid modeling,data visualisation,Mobile communication,sensor information fusion architecture,centralized data fusion,object detection,Networked information processing,Radar tracking,fused information visualization,virtual maritime surveillance system,Computational modeling,central location,Tactical display,video surveillance,virtual world,Information fusion,oceanographic techniques,"
"maritime surveillance in the intracoastal waterway using networked underwater acoustic sensors integrated with a regional command center","2010","Underwater passive acoustic directional sensors and Seaweb through-water networked acoustic communications are implemented in the Intracoastal Waterway at Morehead City, North Carolina on the U.S. eastern seaboard. The objective is to demonstrate capability for first-alert protection of a high-value port facility against asymmetric threats that intelligence sources indicate are arriving via watercraft. Battery-powered acoustic sensors are rapidly deployed at widely separated chokepoint locations in shallow 5-10 meter water. These sensors autonomously detect the passage of a maritime vessel and generate a contact report indicating time, location and heading of the target. Seaweb through-water acoustic communications delivers the contact report via a scalable wide-area underwater network including multiple acoustic repeater nodes and a radio/acoustic communications (Racom) gateway buoy. The Racom gateway telemeters the contact report via Iridium satellite communications to an ashore command center with low latency. The in situ acoustic detection is corroborated using shore-based video surveillance to classify the contact as friendly or actionable.","Racom,surveillance,maritime vessel,Iridium satellite communication,intracoastal waterway,seaweb through-water networked acoustic communication,high-value port facility,Repeaters,first-alert protection,maritime domain awareness,data fusion,Racom gateway telemeter,distance 5 m to 10 m,underwater passive acoustic directional sensor,marine safety,maritime surveillance,underwater acoustic telemetry,acoustic communications,battery-powered acoustic sensor,underwater acoustic communication,Acoustics,regional command center,scalable wide-area underwater network,Logic gates,autonomous processing,Acoustic sensors,operational adaptation,shore-based video surveillance,national security,radio-acoustic communication gateway buoy,Surveillance,in situ acoustic detection,Modems,acoustic transducers,military communication,underwater acoustic sensor,Seaweb,telesonar,multiple acoustic repeater node,"
