"data-driven prognostics using a combination of constrained k-means clustering, fuzzy modeling and lof-based score","2017","Today, failure modes characterization and early detection is a key issue in complex assets. This is due to the negative impact of corrective operations and the conservative strategies usually put in practice, focused on preventive maintenance. In this paper anomaly detection issue is addressed in new monitoring sensor data by characterizing and modeling operational behaviors. The learning framework is performed on the basis of a machine learning approach that combines constrained K-means clustering for outlier detection and fuzzy modeling of distances to normality. A final score is also calculated over time, considering the membership degree to resulting fuzzy sets and a local outlier factor. Proposed solution is deployed in a CBM+ platform for online monitoring of the assets. In order to show the validity of the approach, experiments have been conducted on real operational faults in an auxiliary marine diesel engine. Experimental results show a fully comprehensive yet accurate prognostics approach, improving detection capabilities and knowledge management. The performance achieved is quite high (precision, sensitivity and specificity above 93% and κ=0.93), even more so given that a very small percentage of real faults are present in data.","Local outlier factor,Constrained k-means clustering,Behavior characterization,Machine learning,Fuzzy modeling,Condition monitoring,"
"vessel sailing patterns analysis from s-ais data dased on k-means clustering algorithm","2019","Automatic Identification System (AIS) provides abundant near real-time information of moving vessels in the sea of the whole world and has been widely used in the fields of vessel collision avoidance, Maritime Situation Awareness (MSA) and ocean surveillance. The development of satellite-based AIS further expands the range of AIS and enables a wide converge of AIS data collection, which solves the problem of lacking AIS data in high-seas. At the same time, AIS data provides a rich source for data mining for maritime traffic analysis. In this paper, a typical clustering algorithm called K-means is applied to deal with the Space-based AIS(S-AIS) data received by â€œTianTuo-3â€ satellite developed by National University of Defense Technology. We use Elbow Rule to determine the optimal number of clusters and calculate the normalized standard deviation of COG(Course Over Ground) and SOG(Speed Over Ground) of vessels in south Africa area as their features to conduct clustering. This method is supposed to evaluate vessels' sailing stability and used in detection of low-likelihood behaviors or anomalies of vessels.","SOG,surveillance,data mining,Clustering algorithms,vessel behavior,Marine vehicles,vessel collision avoidance,AIS data collection,ocean surveillance,TianTuo-3 satellite,elbow rule,speed over ground,space-based AIS ata,ships,satellite-based AIS,marine safety,K-means,marine engineering,automatic identification system,vessel anomaly,Elbow,k-means clustering algorithm,vessel sailing patterns analysis,pattern clustering,COG,Artificial intelligence,maritime traffic analysis,Satellite broadcasting,South Africa,course over ground,Trajectory,national security,artificial satellites,clustering algorithm,Data mining,normalized standard deviation,Maritime traffic analysis,Space-based AIS,S-AIS data,"
