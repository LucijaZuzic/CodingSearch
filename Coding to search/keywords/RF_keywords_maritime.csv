"systematic knowledge-based product redesign: an empirical study of solar power system for unmanned transport ship","2023","Product redesign is widely required in the process of product innovation, which greatly depends on a series of innovative theories of product. Traditional product redesign can identify functional requirements from customer needs by functional analysis and utilize inventive principles of TRIZ to address the problems. However, the relationships between the customer needs (CNs), engineering parameters (EPs), and inventive principles (IPs) has not been explored, which may limit and hinder the opportunity for product innovation. To improve the design efficiency, Random Forest (RF) is introduced in this method to mine the relationship between EPs and IPs by researching many cases for design knowledge. A systematic redesign process is proposed to apply the design knowledge. Firstly, functional analysis is used to decompose customer needs (CNs) into product functions. And then, the effect-based approach which is the application of scientific laws is used to transform functions into EPs. Secondly, IPs are recommended based on EPs by a trained RF model. Finally, the specific solution is generated from the problem domain using the analogy design based on the Su-Field model. The effectiveness of the method is verified in the redesign of solar power systems for unmanned transport ships.","Effect-based approach,Functional analysis,Random Forest (RF),Product redesign,Analogy design,Theory of innovation problem solving (TRIZ),"
"an intelligent maritime communication signal recognition algorithm based on acwgan","2020","In maritime communications systems, there are marine VHF communications systems that meet GMDSS standards in addition to AIS and VDES systems which use very high-frequency signals for information communications such as security rescue. But because its communication does not contain the identity information, the channel is easy to be occupied maliciously, thus interferes in normal maritime communication. This paper studies and analyzes the individual identification technology of the VHF signal based on the rf fingerprint technology of signal. Using the improved adversarial generation network ACWGAN(Auxiliary Classifier Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks) to train and identify, we obtain a better classification result. The recognition rate can reach 94% when the SNR is 5 dB for 10 different classes of VHF signal.","RF fingerprint technology,telecommunication computing,Marine vehicles,Generative adversarial networks,signal classification,RF fingerprint,neural nets,Gallium nitride,maritime communications systems,Artificial intelligence,Auxiliary Classifier Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks,Fingerprint recognition,Training,VHF radio propagation,Marine VHF System,marine communication,intelligent maritime communication signal recognition algorithm,ACWGAN algorithm,Computational modeling,ACWGAN,VHF signal,GMDSS standards,"
"identifying key features in aggregated real-life ais-messages for classification of maritime vessels by random forests","2023","Classification of vessels is a major task in many duties of maritime surveillance. In previous work, ad hoc approaches for classifying maritime vessels were applied to large sets of single AIS messages. The resulting performance has been explored based on real-life datasets in different maritime areas. The approaches were used in a particular application scenario of detecting AIS spoofing in fishery scenarios. Seeing good classification results, in particular by Random Forests, the questions arise whether these at least partly resulted from overfitting phenomena and which of the feature of classification in this problem are most relevant. To address these questions in the current contribution, AIS messages are aggregated per vessel and by the hour by statistical means providing a new AIS feature representation as a basis for classification. By providing a new data representation to the Random Forest classifier, we evaluate classification performance. Then we restrict the presented data to the semantic feature subgroups of the vesselâ€™s positional, course, speed, and dimensions data individually and identify the key features of the classification. The results show that in our exemplary maritime experiments, classification relies mostly on vesselsâ€™ positional and dimensional information.","Semantics,experimental comparison,aggregated messages,Random forests,Surveillance,Classification,Artificial intelligence,key features,Sensitivity,Task analysis,Behavioral sciences,performance evaluation,maritime surveillance systems,AIS,"
"research on the construction of maritime legal knowledge graph","2022","As the marine industry booms, the maritime legal documents are of great importance to the maneuver on the sea. However, the traditional way of consulting the text can not meet the demand of maritime operation nowadays. This paper aims to explore a way to extract and strengthen data from maritime legal texts to better support legal question answering. To mine knowledge from unstructured maritime laws and regulations, this paper proposes a method to build the maritime legal knowledge graph. To extract information from unstructured texts, BERT+BiLSTM+CRF is used for named entity recognition. DeepKE toolkit is used for relation extraction. And to strengthen the logics between entities, heterogeneous nodes are introduced to enhance the semantic associations in the maritime legal knowledge graph. The document-enhanced knowledge graph expanded in scale, so it can better support subsequent intelligent applications.","maritime law,Semantics,Pipelines,Regulation,knowledge graph,unstructured maritime laws,Information retrieval,heterogeneous entities,maritime legal documents,information retrieval,natural language processing,Text recognition,support legal question answering,question answering (information retrieval),law,document-enhanced knowledge graph,maritime legal knowledge graph,named entity recognition,graph theory,law administration,Ontologies,text analysis,maritime operation,maritime legal texts,Law,"
"coprime synthetic aperture radar (copsar): a new acquisition mode for maritime surveillance","2015","In this paper, we propose a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) technique able, in the case of bright targets over a dark background, to reduce the amount of data to be stored and processed, and, at the same time, to increase the range swath, with no geometric resolution loss. Accordingly, the proposed approach can be usefully employed in ocean monitoring for ship detection. The technique consists of a new SAR acquisition mode and of very simple processing. It is based on the adaptation of the coprime array beamforming concept to the case of SAR systems: two interlaced sequences of pulses are transmitted, with two sub-Nyquist pulse repetition frequencies (PRFs) that are equal to the Nyquist PRF divided by two coprime integer numbers. Each sequence is separately processed via standard SAR processing, and the two final aliased images are combined in a very simple way to cancel aliasing. We call the proposed approach â€œcoprime SARâ€ (CopSAR). Three different implementations are proposed, and the effectiveness of the CopSAR concept is demonstrated by using both simulated and real SAR data. It turns out that the significant data amount reduction and the range swath increase are only paid with a reduction of the target-to-background ratio and with the presence of a (nonstringent) limit on ship azimuth size.","range swath,standard SAR processing,Antennas,coprime array beamforming concept,ship detection,CopSAR target-to-background ratio,SAR systems,Marine vehicles,coprime synthetic aperture radar,sub-Nyquist pulse repetition frequencies,Synthetic aperture radar,ocean monitoring,SAR technique,Standards,maritime surveillance,synthetic aperture radar,synthetic aperture radar (SAR),geometric resolution loss,CopSAR concept,maritime applications,SAR acquisition mode,Azimuth,Sensors,ship azimuth size,Coprime sampling,remote sensing by radar,Arrays,oceanographic techniques,"
"on the effectiveness of ai-assisted anomaly detection methods in maritime navigation","2020","The automatic identification system (AIS) has become an essential tool for maritime security. Nevertheless, how to effectively use the static and dynamic voyage information of the AIS data in maritime traffic situation awareness is still a challenge. This paper presents a comparative study of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques on their effectiveness in dealing with various anomalies in maritime domain using the AIS data. The AIS on-off switching (OOS) anomaly is critical in maritime security, since AIS technology is susceptible to manipulation and it can be switched on and off to hide illegal activities. Thus, we try to detect and distinguish between intentional and non-intentional AIS OOS anomalies through our AI -assisted anomaly detection framework. We use AIS data, in particular positional and navigational status of vessels, to study the effectiveness of seven AI techniques, such as artificial neural network, support vector machine, logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, decision tree, random forest and naive Bayes, in detecting the AIS OOS anomalies. Our experimental results show that ANN and SVM are the most suitable techniques in detecting the AIS OOS anomalies with 99.9% accuracy. Interestingly, the ANN model outperforms others when trained with a balanced (i.e., same order of samples per class) dataset, and SVM, on the other hand, is suitable when training dataset is unbalanced.","maritime traffic situation awareness,AI-assisted anomaly detection,decision trees,Support vector machines,logistic regression,Anomaly detection,static voyage information,random forests,ANN,marine navigation,Feature extraction,security of data,maritime security,k-nearest neighbors,regression analysis,AIS technology,naive Bayes,neural nets,naive Bayes methods,automatic identification system,marine safety,marine engineering,support vector machines,maritime navigation,dynamic voyage information,maritime domain,random forest,SVM,Artificial intelligence,AIS on-off switching anomaly,nearest neighbour methods,artificial neural network,Training,Trajectory,support vector machine,nonintentional AIS OOS anomalies,Navigation,artificial intelligence,decision tree,AIS data,"
"a fault detector/classifier for closed-ring power generators using machine learning","2021","Condition-based monitoring of power-generation systems is naturally becoming a standard approach in industry due to its inherent capability of fast fault detection, thus improving system efficiency and reducing operational costs. Most such systems employ expertise-reliant rule-based methods. This work proposes a different framework, in which machine-learning algorithms are used for detecting and classifying several fault types in a power-generation system of dynamically positioned vessels. First, principal component analysis is used to extract relevant information from labeled data. A random-forest algorithm then learns hidden patterns from faulty behavior in order to infer fault detection from unlabeled data. Results on fault detection and classification for the proposed approach show significant improvement on accuracy and speed when compared to results from rule-based methods over a comprehensive database.","Random forests,Condition-based monitoring,Classification,Principal components,Machine learning,Detection,"
"neural network-based automatic reconstruction of missing vessel trajectory data","2019","Automatic identification system (AIS) is an independent tracking system which has been widely utilized on ships to frequently broadcast the time-stamped vessel position reports. The generated massive AIS data can contribute to protecting maritime security and enhancing maritime transportation efficiency, such as maritime surveillance, anomaly detection and traffic route extraction, etc. However, the received AIS-based vessel trajectories commonly suffer from missing data due to network overload and bad weathers. To improve the quality of vessel trajectories for further researches, a two-step calculation method for vessel trajectory reconstruction is proposed in this work. In particular, the Random Forest method is introduced in the first step to automatically identify the missing position records within vessel trajectories. The missing data points could be accurately estimated from both theoretical and practical perspectives. The second step proposes a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based supervised learning method to reconstruct the vessel trajectories with missing AIS data. The LSTM-based reconstruction method is able to take full advantage of the similar geometrical features behind massive vessel trajectories. Experimental results have confirmed the superior performance of the proposed two-step method in terms of both effectiveness and robustness.","two-step calculation method,surveillance,missing position records,massive AIS data,LSTM-based reconstruction method,random forests,anomaly detection,transportation,Marine vehicles,trajectory reconstruction,maritime security,Random Forest method,long short-term memory-based supervised learning method,network overload,Radio frequency,Decision trees,neural nets,neural network-based automatic reconstruction,vessel trajectory data,ships,automatic identification system,marine safety,marine engineering,maritime surveillance,AIS-based vessel trajectories,trajectory data mining,time-stamped vessel position reports,Logic gates,massive vessel trajectories,Automatic identification system,missing AIS data,Trajectory,traffic route extraction,missing data points,vessel trajectory reconstruction,two-step method,independent tracking system,long short-term memory,maritime transportation efficiency,learning (artificial intelligence),tracking,bad weathers,"
"glacial activity reflected in a continuous lacustrine record since the early holocene from the proglacial laigu lake on the southeastern tibetan plateau","2016","The southeastern Tibetan Plateau is an important area of monsoonal maritime glaciation, and it serves as a watershed for several major Asian rivers, including the Brahmaputra River and the Lantsang River. Glacial activity is sensitive to climate change in this area. However, due to high annual ablation and accumulation in this region, ice cores over long time scales are difficult to retrieve. In addition, reconstructed glacial activity from moraine dates is usually discontinuous. Here, we use a sediment core retrieved from Laigu Lake, which is a proglacial lake located in the headwaters of the Parlung Zangbo River, the largest tributary of the Brahmaputra River, to reflect glacial activities over the last ~8000years in this area. Samples of the sediment core were analyzed for magnetic susceptibility, XRF (X-ray florescence) scanned elemental concentration and grain size. The results indicated that the magnetic susceptibility and CPS (peak area counts per second) of strontium (Sr) could be used as proxies for glacial activity. The CPS of Sr and the magnetic susceptibility were lower and the glacial activity was weak before 4.3calka BP. Expansion of the glaciers in this area began from 4.3calka BP and continued to develop after ~3.3calka BP. From 2.2calka BP to 1.6calka BP, the glaciers retreated substantially, followed by another development period until the onset of modern global warming. Based on our findings and other climate records, we concluded that glacial activity in the southeastern Tibetan Plateau areas was mainly influenced by Northern Hemisphere temperatures and summer insolation over a sub-orbital time scale, but did not respond to the Indian monsoon.","XRF,The southeastern Tibetan Plateau,Glacial activity,Magnetic susceptibility,Lacustrine sediment,Holocene,"
"ship arrival prediction and its value on daily container terminal operation","2018","Effective prediction of ship arrivals should provide the estimated delay or advance of arrival ships with greater accuracy, and improve the performance of container terminal operations. Therefore, taking Gangji (Yining) Container Terminal (GYCT), China, as an example, this paper resorts to data mining approaches to predict ship arrivals and explore the value of such predicted ship arrivals on the container terminal operation. First, this study applies three data mining approaches, including Back-Propagation network (BP), Classification and Regression Tree (CART) and Random Forest (RF), to estimate the delay or advance of ship arrivals using the collected data of ship arrivals. Then the predictive performance of these three approaches is compared and discussed, it is concluded that RF performs better than BP and CART, and ETA month and ship length are the most important determinants of ship arrivals in GYCT terminal. Finally, series simulation experiments are conducted to assess the value of the ship arrivals predicted by RF model on the improvement on daily operation planning of berth allocation and quay crane assignment in the GYCT terminal. And the results show that incorporating the predicted ship arrivals by RF model is beneficial to improve the performance of operation planning of GYCT terminal.","Late/early arrivals,Berth allocation,Data mining,Arrival prediction,Container terminal operation,Quay crane assignment,"

Various research topics on the optimization of maritime logistics are introduced in more detail, including topics on the design and operation container terminals, empty container management, the design and operation of container transportation systems. Some approaches to solve the problems, which have been developed in Korea, will be introduced. We also introduce the case of investigating new pervasive computing technologies of RFID, RTLS, and mesh networking for improving the efficiency of container port terminals. Unfortunately, container terminal is a harsh environment in which wireless communication would be unstable. To address these challenges, a case of developing the mesh network protocol based real time locating system is introduced for building smart container terminal management.

"green rf/fso communications in cognitive relay-based space information networks for maritime surveillance","2019","In this paper, we provide an overview of a space-based network for the maritime surveillance information sharing and evaluate the coverage, the throughput and the real-time reception capacity of the presented systems. The focus is on the feeder link of a multi-hop geostationary satellite system. We propose a cognitive relay-based architecture for the inter-satellite and satellite-to-ground communication with a multi-band spectrum sensing operating on both free-space optical (FSO) and radio frequency (RF) bands. Furthermore, modeling the spectrum sensing energy as a Gamma distribution we derive the formula of the network energy consumption in presence of multipath fading and considering two different data relay schemes: amplify-and-forward (AF) and decode-and-forward (DF). We prove that the RF/FSO communication in the proposed relay-based architecture enhances the data transmission increasing the throughput and the real-time reception capacity and reducing the network energy consumption. The performance evaluation shows that the DF scheme overcomes the AF one in terms of energy consumption while the AF scheme overcomes the DF one in terms of probability detection, both experience the same throughput. Finally, the proposed novel architecture has been compared with existing ones showing that it enhances the current maritime surveillance systems by jointly optimizing communication functionalities.","inter-satellite communication,surveillance,telecommunication power management,cognitive radio,real-time reception capacity,multi-hop networks,satellite systems,Marine vehicles,radio frequency free-space optical communications,cognitive relay-based networks,radio spectrum management,green RF/FSO communications,free-space optical communication,Satellite communication,detection probability,network energy consumption,marine engineering,optimisation,coverage evaluation,amplify-and-forward,multiband spectrum sensing,feeder link,decode-and-forward,maritime surveillance information sharing,space information networks,multihop geostationary satellite system,Spread spectrum communication,relay networks (telecommunication),decode and forward communication,data relay,satellite links,Maritime surveillance,signal detection,satellite-to-ground communication,Surveillance,throughput,RF/FSO communication,multipath fading,network energy,amplify and forward communication,oceanographic techniques,"
"maritime automated targets recognition algorithm test bed for high resolution isar imagery","2013","A maritime automatic target recognition system is under development to perform ship classification using images from inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) systems. This work will describe the algorithm framework for feature extraction, classification, and aim-point recognition. ISAR systems produce two-dimensional images of ships from the periodic motion inherent to all maritime objects and can be used to distinguish objects of interest for Homeland Security. There is a need for real-time classification of these objects. This work extends the state of the art in two ways: One - current maritime classification focuses on satellite ISAR, creating latency for classification[1]; and Two - work with Homeland Security ISAR radar systems is focused on concealed weapon detection [2,3]. This work uses localized ISAR images from stationary radars to classify maritime objects. Since the aspect and cross-range scale factor are continually changing, ISAR images form distinct representations unique to each object under observation. These distinct representations are analogous to visual images in many ways. They have unique shapes and areas of strong return, much in the same way objects in passive images have unique sizes and colors. However, ISAR images are synthetic portrayals of scattered field data from active sensor RF sensors whereas visual images are observations of passive sensors. This distinction must be a considered as a design constraint in the classification system - each feature employed must be exhaustively examined regarding its physical counterpart. Within that constraint, ISAR synthetic imagery feature extraction techniques can leverage from previous work developed for passive sensors. This is especially the case of High Range Resolution (HRR) ISAR systems. After extraction from ISAR prototype images, a set of representative features will be used to train a support vector machine (SVM) classifier, a supervised learning model capable of pattern recognition.","marine radar,active sensor,Inverse synthetic aperture radar,image motion analysis,Marine vehicles,Feature extraction,image colour analysis,supervised learning model,Target recognition,periodic motion,ships,radar computing,marine engineering,support vector machines,2D ship images,object detection,automated target recognition,synthetic aperture radar,feature extraction,image classification,maritime automated target recognition algorithm test bed,high range resolution ISAR imagery,RF sensors,Classification algorithms,SVM,homeland security ISAR radar systems,radar imaging,support vector machine classifier,Doppler effect,high resolution,Image segmentation,concealed weapon detection,weapons,satellite ISAR system,aim-point recognition,inverse synthetic aperture radar systems,stationary radars,Image resolution,national security,maritime object classification,image sensors,ship classification,learning (artificial intelligence),pattern recognition,passive sensors,object recognition,oceanographic techniques,"
"mesoscale modeling of smoke transport over the southeast asian maritime continent: interplay of sea breeze, trade wind, typhoon, and topography","2013","The online-coupled Weather Research and Forecasting model with Chemistry (WRFchem) is used to simulate the transport of smoke particles over the Southeast Asian Maritime Continent during September–October 2006. In this period, dry conditions associated with the moderate El Niño event caused the largest regional biomass burning outbreak since 1997. Smoke emission in WRFchem is specified according to the Fire Locating and Modeling of Burning Emissions (FLAMBE) database derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) fire products. The modeled smoke transport pathway is found to be consistent with the MODIS true color images and measured mass concentration of surface PM10 (particulate matter with diameter less than 10μm). The interplay of sea/land breezes, typhoons and storms over the subtropical western Pacific Ocean, trade winds, and topographic effects, can be clearly seen in the model simulation. The most severe smoke events in 1–5 October 2006 are found to be associated with the meteorological responses to the typhoon Xangsane (#18) over the western subtropical Pacific Ocean, which moved smoke from Sumatra eastward in the lower troposphere (below 700hPa), forming smoke layers mixed with and above the boundary layer clouds over Borneo. In contrast, the second largest week-long smoke transport event of 15–18 October 2006 was associated with the seasonal monsoonal transition period, during which smoke plumes were wide spread over the 5°S–5°N zone as a result of (a) the near surface divergence coupled with the 700hPa bifurcation of wind (flowing both to the west and to the east), and (b) the near-surface southeasterly and easterly winds along the equator transporting smoke from Borneo to Sumatra and Peninsular Malaysia. Analysis of data from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarisation (CALIOP) shows that smoke particles in October 2006 were primarily located within 3.5km above the surface. Smoke particles contributed roughly half of the total aerosol extinction retrieved by CALIOP. Results suggest that the smoke injection height in the model should be set lower than the 2–5km commonly used in transport simulations; smoke release at ~0.8km instead of 2km above surface gives a consistently better match to CALIOP observations. Numerical experiments further show that the Titiwangsa Mountains in Malaysia Peninsula and Tama Abu Mountains in Borneo have significant impacts on smoke transport and the surface air quality in the vicinity.","Sea breeze,Trade wind,Typhoon,Southeast Asian Maritime Continent,Smoke particles,"

"a smart predict-then-optimize method for targeted and cost-effective maritime transportation","2023","In maritime transportation, port state control (PSC) is the last line of defense against substandard ships. During a PSC inspection, PSC officers (PSCOs) identify ship deficiencies that lead to a ship's detention, which can cause severe economic and reputational losses to the ship operator. Therefore, this study innovatively uses PSC inspection data to design ship maintenance plans for ship operators to minimize overall operational costs. We identify three types of operational costs associated with each deficiency code: inspection cost, repair cost, and risk cost in the ship operators’ decision-making process. The risk cost of a deficiency code is strongly related to the detention contribution of the deficiency items under a deficiency code, as indicated by the feature importance of that code in the random forest (RF) model used to predict detention outcomes. To design ship maintenance plans, the sequential predict-then-optimize (PO) method typically solves the optimization problem using input parameters, including the predicted probabilities of having deficiency items under each code and the three types of operational costs. However, the loss function in this two-stage framework does not consider the effect of predictions on the downstream decisions. Hence, we use a smart predict-then-optimize (SPO) method using an ensemble of SPO trees (SPOTs). Each SPOT uses an SPO loss function that measures the sub-optimality of the decisions derived from the predicted parameters. By exploiting the structural properties of the optimization problem analyzed in this study, we demonstrate that training an SPOT for this problem can be simplified tremendously by using the relative class frequency of true labels within a leaf node to yield a minimum SPO loss. Computational experiments show that the SPO-based ship maintenance scheme is superior to other schemes and can reduce a ship's total operating expenses by approximately 1% over the PO-based scheme and by at least 3% over schemes that do not use machine learning methods. In the long run, SPO-based ship maintenance plans also improve the efficiency of port logistics by reducing the resources needed for formal PSC inspections and alleviating port congestion.","Prescriptive analytics,Data-driven optimization,Port state control (PSC) inspection,Ship maintenance planning,"

"machine learning for shaft power prediction and analysis of fouling related performance deterioration","2021","Improving operational performance and reducing fuel consumption is increasingly important for shipping companies. Ship performance degrades over time due to hull and propeller fouling; therefore assessing when fouling effects are significant enough to warrant cleaning is critical. Advancements in onboard data logging systems, combined with machine learning techniques, unlock the potential to predict fouling effects accurately and determine when to clean. This study evaluates five models for shaft power prediction: Multiple Linear Regression, Decision Tree (AdaBoost), K – Nearest Neighbours, Artificial Neural Network and Random Forest. The importance of pre-processing is highlighted, contributing to the creation of a model with lower errors than previous studies. The significance of environmental parameters was explored, with the novel integration of wave statistics to the operational dataset, and simulated power-speed curves created from predictions to identify performance deterioration due to fouling. The Random Forest model was most effective in predicting shaft power, with an error of 1.17%. The addition of ‘Days Since Clean’ and ‘Significant Wave Height’ increased prediction accuracy by 0.07% and 0.12% respectively.

"automatic identification of maritime incidents from unstructured articles","2018","In this paper, we present two Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for identifying maritime incidents described in unstructured articles from multiple sources. The first technique is a document classification scheme that determines if an article describes a maritime incident. Two variations of each article are created: the first only contains the article's title, the other contains the title and content. These are converted to both binary and frequency bags-of-words. Furthermore, two feature selection methods are tested: Weka's CfsSubsetEval and retaining the 300 most frequent words. Each dataset is tested with 41 classifiers from the Weka suite, with the most accurate classifiers including Logistic Regression (98.5%), AdaBoostM1(BayesNet) (98.33%), and RandomForest (97.56%). The second technique performs information extraction on an article to determine the location of the maritime incident.

"cultural dynamics and ceramic resource use at late bronze age/early iron age troy, northwestern turkey","2013","Changes in resource use over time can provide insight into technological choice and the extent of long-term stability in cultural practices. In this paper we re-evaluate the evidence for a marked demographic shift at the inception of the Early Iron Age at Troy by applying a robust macroscale analysis of changing ceramic resource use over the Late Bronze and Iron Age. We use a combination of new and legacy analytical datasets (NAA and XRF), from excavated ceramics, to evaluate the potential compositional range of local resources (based on comparisons with sediments from within a 10 km site radius). Results show a clear distinction between sediment-defined local and non-local ceramic compositional groups. Two discrete local ceramic resources have been previously identified and we confirm a third local resource for a major class of EIA handmade wares and cooking pots. This third source appears to derive from a residual resource on the Troy peninsula (rather than adjacent alluvial valleys). The presence of a group of large and heavy pithoi among the non-local groups raises questions about their regional or maritime origin.","Local production,Bottom-up sampling,Macro-analysis,Multivariate analysis,Neutron Activation Analysis,Statistical power relationships,Legacy datasets,"
"trial results conducted by multiple canadian government agencies of the recent covert technology developped by tektrap to trace and track the integrity of maritime containers worldwide","2012","iCargo is an easy-to-install miniature covert electronic device combining GPS and door lock tracking with wireless and satellite communications to remotely track the status and position of maritime containers worldwide. A system of strategically placed readers combined with satellite or cellular communications and redundant technologies ensures that security breaches are detected early and reliably anywhere along the supply chain. iCargo provides a GPS trace of where a container has travelled and where the container might have been opened. Deviations from the expected itinerary in time and/or distance are detected and the container can be flagged for physical inspection. Such a system helps borders authorities to focus their energy on suspicious cargo with the overall impact of speeding the flow of all cargo. iCargo uses a patented technique to convert the metal structure of the container into an antenna thereby allowing it to be installed behind the rubber seal of the door in a truly covert fashion. Other technologies are visible from the exterior and vulnerable to tampering and damage during container handling. The location within the door gasket is ideal for monitoring the door open/close status as well as for acting as a communications gateway to optional internal sensors. There are approximately 7 million maritime containers entering/leaving North America every year. The interiors of such containers are rarely inspected. Such containers may include contraband, hazmats, weapons or illegal items that present an economic or security risk. Despite significant security improvements since Sept-11th, only 5% of the maritime containers go through physical inspection. The use of the iCargo mounted on a container at the point of departure will assist government authorities in making better decisions about which containers to inspect thereby speeding up the overall throughput of all containers. In today's lean economy, goods in transit do not contribute to economic growth but instead are added costs to customers and shippers. With rising fuel and transportation costs, delays at borders are becoming increasingly expensive. Early detection via the iCargo system will help to reduce these costs by not only helping to shorten inspection delays but by also allowing officials to focus their energy on suspicious cargo thereby improving border security. Tektrap has been selected for the Pool of Pre-qualified Proposals for the Canadian Innovation Commercialization Program (CICP). CICP is a very competitive program that targets recent innovations, especially in the field of national security, which are ready for the beta phase of product development. Within this award, iCargo will be evaluated during spring and early summer 2012 by Canada Border Services Agency for Canadian-US border application, by Defense Research and Development Canada, DND, for land, rail and air applications in the Canada Nordic environment, and by Transport Canada for trans-Canada land/rail and Asia-Canada sea conditions. In addition to presenting the results of these multiple trial results, this paper covers the innovative engineering aspects of using the metal enclosure of a maritime container as a VHF, cellular, satellite, GPS and Wifi antenna, thereby eliminating the need to add any external antenna and achieving the goal of being 100% covert.","Satellites,Security,trial results,Monitoring,Global Positioning System,damage,maritime containers,communications gateway,inspection,cellular communications,satellite communication,iCargo,Containers,physical inspection,door lock tracking,optional internal sensors,maritime containers worldwide,Tektrap,Maritime container intrusion sensor and Active RFID,wireless communications,containers,supply chain,GPS,government,easy-to-install miniature covert electronic device,Frequency modulation,satellite communications,door gasket,multiple Canadian government agencies,Energy harvesting,Maritime container traceability,container handling,tampering,"

"multifunction maritime radar and rf systemsâ€”technology challenges and areas of development","2022","Modern multifunctional radars (MFRs) offer extremely capable radio frequency (RF) front ends although their role is mostly limited to radar. Expanding the role of a multifunctional radar into a multifunctional radio frequency system (MFRFS), incorporating functions such as wireless communications and electronic warfare, has the potential to offer significant benefits. Technologies such as direct RF digitization, AI resource management, and high bandwidth amplifiers could enable a future MFRFS to fulfil these functions. Multifunctionality must be a key design driver when procuring MFRFSs; however, this runs counter to the traditional approach of requiring an assured minimum performance of a single functionâ€”while a particular system based around an individual function could potentially outperform the MFRFS, the overall performance across all functions should be better than the performance of a collection of individual systems.","marine radar,direct RF digitization,extremely capable radio frequency front ends,Radar antennas,frequency response,Resource management,Radio frequency,electronic warfare,Maritime communications,Target tracking,MFR,AI resource management,Radar tracking,Electronic warfare,Artificial intelligence,multifunctional radar,future MFRFS,multifunction maritime radar,Radar cross-sections,wireless communications,high bandwidth amplifiers,multifunctional radio frequency system,RF systems,key design driver,Missiles,"

"vital electronics, the key to the developing dynamic gis for the baltic or other maritime environments","2010","Dynamic GIS can provide geospatial information in real-time in support of first responses to natural disasters (e.g. flooding on the Baltic ecosystem), man-made disasters (e.g. oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico), and for Search and Rescue (SAR) missions. All these scenarios require the integration between the real time data acquisition and dynamic GIS. The proposed Vital Electronic System for Maritime Applications (SYSTEM) integrates: a land or sea-based Data Center; a 'Mother Ship' (used for sensor deployment and local data collection); and a large number of easily deployed, disposable, intercommunicating, and intelligent 'Floaters' (equipped with task-specific sensors). An embedded Vital Electronics Computer composed of a hierarchical network of a large number of wireless PSoC-based GNODEs (configurable at deployment), forms the core of SYSTEM. The Floaters include both task-specific Sensing-only GNODEs and Aggregation GNODEs dedicated to local data aggregation and global communications tasks. Sensing GNODE may be equipped with submerged sensors (e.g. water temperature, pressure, salinity, acidity, passive acoustic, SONAR), and/or above water sensors (e.g. air temperature, proximity, sound, light, thermal IR, passive RF, RADAR). Aggregation GNODEs provide absolute location (e.g. GPS or other means) and also long-range communications with the 'Mother Ship', a satellite or airborne platform, and/or a land-based data center. Ultimately, the data collected by the system can be integrated with reference GIS data (such as existing terrain and sea-bottom maps, as well as other live information. The composite data should be web-accessible with the appropriate level of security to relevant agencies and other authorized users.

"combining fm broadcast, accelerometers, ieee 892.15.4 wireless and gps to secure maritime containers worldwide","2010","There are approximately 50 million maritime style containers entering and leaving ports in North America every year and 500 millions worldwide [8]. The interiors of such containers are rarely inspected. With market globalization, a large amount of these containers enter North America on a daily basis. Such containers may include contraband or dangerous items that present an economic or security risk. Despite significant security improvements, only 3 to 5% of the maritime containers, that arrive in or transition through North America, go through physical inspection. Current container tracking technologies solely based on GPS consume high DC power, are costly, require line-of-sight with satellites and they are often too large to be covert. It is possible to overcome some of these limitations by combining GPS with a tracking system based on the FM broadcast signal. Digital FM broadcast is an alternative man-made signal that is ubiquitous, provides a geographically unique frequency spectrum and is about 100,000 as strong as a GPS satellite signal. The combination of GPS and FM, called 'Broadcast Assisted GPSâ„¢' allows the development of a low-cost, low-power and miniature FM-GPS receiver that can trace the path that a container has taken for less than 25$ per container. This paper presents the first results of highway trials (train and sea trials are to be conducted in 2010-2011) of such a low cost, covert, 'Broadcast Assisted GPS'based technology, called 'FM-RFID Tagâ„¢' that records the worldwide displacement of containers and displays the path undertaken by the container while in transit.

"maritime field trial of a dual-band silicon integrated photonics-based radar","2022","This paper reports the development, the complete characterization, and the first outdoor field trial of a coherent dual-band photonics-based radar implemented through integrated photonic circuits. The dual band radar transceiver has been implemented on a silicon-on-insulator platform, and is capable of operating up to the Ku-band. It has been packaged and engineered on a printed circuit board for its use in a complete radar system. The electronic RF front-end in S- and X-bands and the digital baseband equipment have been developed in order to guarantee performance aligned with the state of the art of conventional radars. The developed apparatus has been characterized in S- and X-band in terms of sensitivity, linearity, phase noise, and conversion efficiency, both at chip and system level. The impact and issues related to the used fabrication platform and to the packaged approach have been analyzed. The outdoor field trial has been carried out in a relevant maritime environment close to the port of Livorno (Italy). First, X-band radar acquisitions of a complex maritime scene using a rotating antenna has allowed to verify the radar behavior by comparing the detected scene with official data provided by the automatic identification system mounted on the observed ships. A false alarm probability of 2Ã—10âˆ’5 has been demonstrated, aligned with radar state of the art.

"sarfish: space-based maritime surveillance using complex synthetic aperture radar imagery","2022","Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery is an essential part of maritime surveillance since it can operate in most weather conditions, day and night. Space-borne SAR especially can provide a large surveillance coverage in which both ground-range detected (GRD) imagery at a reduced resolution and single-look complex (SLC) imagery at a finer resolution of the same observation scene are available. Recently, a large, fully labeled, Sentinel-1 GRD based dataset, named xView3-SAR, was released to promote machine learning (ML) research in detection and classification of ships in order to assist with monitoring illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing activities. In this paper, the xView3-SAR's companion SLC dataset, called the SARFish, is introduced. The aim is to promote the use of SLC data for improving IUU fishing ship detection and classification. An ML-based algorithm using the combined GRD-SLC SAR data is presented as a base-line model for demonstration. The algorithm consists of a constant false-alarm rate (CFAR) detector whose false-alarm rate is reduced by a cascade of classifiers trained using the GRD data, followed by a ship classifier trained using the SLC data. Preliminary results suggest that despite not using multi-looks to reduce sea-clutter spikes, the use of SLC images does not degrade ship detection. Furthermore, a very modest improvement in ship classification is observed.11Under contract from Rheinmetall Defence Australia Pty Ltd, Adelaide, SA, Australia.","radio frequencies,classification,space-based maritime Surveillance,Marine vehicles,Machine learning,maritime vessels,maritime objects,Synthetic aperture radar,geophysical image processing,Meteorology,complex Synthetic Aperture Radar imagery,MS,visible frequencies,electro-optic imaging,single-look complex (SLC),synthetic aperture radar,Classification algorithms,radar imaging,Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR),Radar polarimetry,SARFish,sufficient spatial resolution,Australia,radar imaging category,Image resolution,ground-range detected (GRD),constant false-alarm rate (CFAR) detection,space-borne SAR imagery,Surveillance,imaging modalities,Spaceborne radar,remote sensing by radar,image coverage,machine learning (ML),image scene,"

"maritime surveillance with undersampled sar","2017","According to the minimum antenna area constraint, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems require a low-pulse repetition frequency (PRF) to image the wide swaths in ocean surface monitoring scenarios. However, the low PRF that is lower than the Doppler bandwidth will cause azimuth ambiguities. This letter proposes a novel method of mitigating azimuth ambiguities when using an undersampled SAR system for ship detection over the open sea. In this letter, the concept of range subspectra is adopted to misregister the azimuth ambiguity signals. In addition, a change detection method that uses a principal component analysis and k-means clustering is adopted to detect differences in the azimuth ambiguities between two range subspectra images in which the azimuth ambiguities are misregistered. By compensating for the ambiguities in the corresponding image, the ambiguities can be mitigated. This method is only appropriate for bright targets over dark backgrounds in which residual energy loss occurs for useful signals. Both simulated and real data processing results have validated the effectiveness of the proposed method and show that it is feasible for maritime surveillance.","two range subspectra images,ship detection,low-pulse repetition frequency,change detection method,azimuth ambiguity mitigation method,bright targets,Principal component analysis,range subspectrum,Synthetic aperture radar,undersampled,undersampled SAR system,image ambiguities,maritime surveillance,Azimuth ambiguities,real data processing,synthetic aperture radar,ocean surface monitoring scenarios,azimuth ambiguity signals,range subspectra concept,Doppler effect,dark backgrounds,Bandwidth,Azimuth,Doppler bandwidth,residual energy loss,open sea,Imaging,synthetic aperture radar systems,principal component analysis,Barium,minimum antenna area,synthetic aperture radar (SAR),k-mean clustering,oceanographic techniques,"

"a sequential random forest for short-term vessel speed prediction","2022","Short-term vessel speed prediction is exceedingly crucial to various issues in maritime transport, notably in cases with high precision requirement, such as trajectory tracking and collision avoidance. The methods for speed prediction have successively experienced the evolution of empirical formulas, physics-based approaches and data-driven models. Compared to the other two pioneering methods, building the model from data-driven learning seems to be a more appropriate way for ever-larger vessels that entered service in recent years. However, owing to insufficient speed-related features that can be known in advance, such as the engine state and propeller propulsion, traditional data-driven models usually have poor generalization ability when facing new test data. In this paper, taking a case study of a 400,000 DWT ore carrier sailing between China and Brazil, we first provide comparisons of several widely-used data-driven models and select the framework of random forest as the basic. Then, by considering the hardship of directly utilizing real-time monitoring data, we creatively put forward a novel prediction model by introducing sequential data of last historical speed records to bring the potential information of engine state into model learning. Through comprehensive experiments, the superiority and robustness of the proposed model are demonstrated by comparing with other frequently-used time-series prediction methods.","Random forest,Short-term vessel speed prediction,Temporal data,Data-driven methods,Very large ore carriers,"
"a multi-proxy reconstruction of tropical cyclone variability during the past 800 years from robinson lake, nova scotia, canada","2018","This study presents a multi-proxy reconstruction of tropical cyclone (TC) activity for the past 800 years from Robinson Lake, located on the north Atlantic seaboard of Nova Scotia, Canada. Two sediment cores were extracted from Robinson Lake and were dated by 210Pb and 14C methods, and analyzed for organic matter content, sediment grain size, and a range of elements and elemental ratios determined by XRF core scanning. A distinct sand layer in the most recent sediments is attributed to Hurricane Juan, which struck the coast of Nova Scotia on September 29, 2003. Our study shows that peaks in grain size farther down-core are generally correlated with abrupt increases in Br and Br/Ti. XRF-derived Br measurements are an indicator of marine organic carbon (MOC), and the increases in Br likely reflect incursions of marine water and nutrients into the lake as a result of storm surges. The results show that the period from ~1475 to 1670 CE contains at least 3–4 storm beds, and are interpreted as the most active TC period within the last ~800 years for this region. Our results are consistent with recent research from Salt Pond, Massachusetts (Donnelly et al. 2015), which provides evidence for heightened TC activity during the same period as our study at Robinson Lake. Our study represents one of the highest latitude paleotempestological studies from the North Atlantic basin which will help the testing of hypotheses concerning long-term changes in North Atlantic TC activity under future climate change scenarios.","X-ray fluorescence,Grain size analysis,North Atlantic,Tropical cyclones,Paleotempestology,"
"a blockchain-based authentication scheme and secure architecture for iot-enabled maritime transportation systems","2023","Although modern Maritime Transportation Systems (MTS) have been extensively benefited from Internet of Things (IoT) technology, but still the risks and challenges in safety and reliability have increased substantially. The involvement of different maritime parties in the marine transportation flow scheduling and management further escalates these challenges. Thus, we need an IoT-based collaborative processing system that unifies the modular structure and integrates multiple modules involved in MTS. Moreover, the need for a shared and controlled access mechanism that cannot be manipulated or tampered by unauthorized parties is also essential requirement in MTS. Blockchain, as an emerging technology, has become a key tool in data security protection because of its non-tampering and non-forgery characteristics. Keeping in view of this aspect, in this paper, an IoT-based collaborative processing system based on blockchain is proposed for marine transportation flow scheduling and management. In addition, we propose a novel consensus mechanism based on Verifiable Random Function (VRF) and reputation voting to reduce the communication cost in blockchain consensus communication process. The proposed scheme has been validated in a simulated environment and the results illustrate that the scheme has obvious effect in resisting replay attack and camouflage attack. Furthermore, the optimized consensus mechanism improves the security by 8% and the transaction processing speed by 6% on the premise that the communication cost is basically unchanged.","Blockchains,computer network security,Safety,Internet of Things,marine transportation flow scheduling,transportation,Authentication,Monitoring,Industries,IoT-based collaborative processing system,blockchains,security of data,blockchain-based authentication scheme,blockchain,Information security,Maritime transportation systems,IoT-enabled Maritime Transportation Systems,blockchain consensus communication process,secure architecture,authentication mechanism,transaction processing,data security protection,different maritime parties,modern Maritime Transportation Systems,authorisation,shared controlled access mechanism,"

"elemental geochemistry and organic facies of selected cretaceous coals from the benue trough basin in nigeria: implication for paleodepositional environments","2022","Benue Trough basin is geologically subdivided into three segments. It consists of marine and continental sediments that are affected by folding movements. In the upper section, the continental coal-bearing Campano-Maastrichtian-age is found within Gombe Sandstone and the Cenozoic Kerri-Kerri Formation of the Tertiary. In the middle segment, the late Turonian/early Santonian coal-bearing Awgu Formation lies conformably on the Ezeaku Formation. In the lower part, shales at Nkporo mark marine incursion and deposition of the Maastrichtian Mamu Formation coal measures. Cretaceous coal samples taken from the three segments of Benue Trough basin were examined using ultimate and proximate, organic petrographic, x-ray fluorescence (XRF) and laser ablation-induced coupled plasma spectroscopy (LA-ICPMS) analytical techniques. Results of trace element ratios, Ce/Ce* values (“where Ce* is the theoretical Ce value derived from a chondrite-normalized rare earth element (REE) pattern”), authigenic uranium values, and low hydrogen content indicate deposition under oxic to suboxic conditions. However, the V/Ni and V/Sc ratios indicate under oxic, suboxic to reducing conditions. The Y/Ho values for selected coals are lower than the range for seawater, indicating terrigenous influence. The Sr/Ba values indicate low influence of saline water during deposition and a strong continental rather than marine influence. High value of vitrinite and low proportion of liptinite/intertinite suggest that peat in the study areas were situated on the irregular basin floor where sediment thicknesses vary from place to place thus the depositional environments shifted causing mineral matter filling in coal. Based on the tissue preservation index (TPI) and gelification index (GI), LFB, CHK, OKB, LMZ, IMG; and ENG (high GI and high TPI) were deposited in telmatic facies; wet-forest swamps with rapid organic matter accumulation. This trend indicates mild humification and strong gelification of plant tissues which ascribed to high rate of subsidence with wood- and bark-derived telovitrinite. The MGA peats were deposited in terrestrial facies in a dry-forest swamp with wood-derived telo-inertinite. The coal samples code-named IMG and ENG were deposited in planar margin mires. However, coal samples code-named LFB, CHK and LMZ were deposited in planar central mires. Lastly, OKB and MGA were deposited in transitional-wet and transitional-dry mire. The low V and Ni concentrations, low H/C, high O/C, high C/N, and very low N/C ratios <0.05 implies Type III land-plant organic matter that is not oil-prone.

"ship trajectory prediction based on machine learning and deep learning: a systematic review and methods analysis","2023","Ship trajectory prediction based on Automatic Identification System (AIS) data has attracted increasing interest as it helps prevent collision accidents and eliminate potential navigational conflicts. Therefore, it is necessary and urgent to conduct a systematic analysis of all the prediction methods to help reveal their advantages to ensure safety at sea in different scenarios. It is particularly important and significant within the context of unmanned ships forming a new hybrid maritime traffic together with manned ships in the future. This paper aims to conduct a comparative analysis of the up-to-date ship trajectory prediction algorithms based on machine learning and deep learning methods. To do so, five classical machine learning methods (i.e., Kalman Filter, Gaussian Process Regression, Support Vector Regression, Random Forest, and Back Propagation Network) and eight deep learning methods (i.e., Recurrent Neural Networks, Long Short-Term Memory, Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory, Gate Recurrent Unit, Bi-directional Gate Recurrent Unit, Sequence to Sequence, Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network, and Transformer) are thoroughly analysed and compared from the algorithm essence and applications to excavate their features and adaptability for manned and unmanned ships. The findings reveal the characteristics of various prediction methods and provide valuable implications for different stakeholders to guide the best-fit choice of a particular method as the solution under a specific circumstance. It also makes contributions to the extraction of the research difficulties of ship trajectory prediction and the corresponding solutions that are put forward to guide the development of future research.","Deep learning,Maritime safety,Hybrid maritime traffic,Trajectory prediction,AIS data,Machine learning,"
"analysis of limit setting rationales for protection of maritime vhf radio","2017","IEC 60533 is a product standard that puts strict requirements on all equipment on board of ships. Except for dedicated bridge equipment, there are hardly any products available that comply. One aspect from this standard is the low emission limit for radio frequency protection of the maritime very high frequency radio telephony system. This limit appears not to be based on a minimum range to receive a distress call, but on the possibility of receiving the lowest possible signal in an assumed placement of equipment. An analysis of the standard and a reconstruction of their rationale have led to an alternative, functional requirement with proper rationale, which can give the system integrator more flexibility in choosing equipment. This novel risk-based approach results in the same objective, i.e., an interference-free environment. Measurements have been performed to demonstrate possible disturbance sources and to investigate the communication range.","IEC Standards,Marine equipment,radiocommunication,maritime very high frequency radio telephony system,IEC standards,Marine vehicles,radiofrequency protection,Radio frequency,Radio navigation,radio frequency (RF) noise,IEC 60533,Immunity testing,very high frequency (VHF) radio communication,VHF radio propagation,standardization,marine communication,RF sensitivity,maritime VHF radio protection,limit setting rationales analysis,"

"random finite set tracking for anomaly detection in the presence of clutter","2020","In this paper, a sequential Bayesian framework is proposed to address the task of joint anomaly detection and tracking for surveillance applications in the presence of clutter. This is achieved by modeling the anomaly as a switching unknown control input which goes into action by modifying the expected dynamics of a target and ceases its activity (becomes nonexistent) under nominal behavior. Random Finite Sets (RFS) make it possible to represent the switching nature of the object anomalous behavior and derive a hybrid Bernoulli filter (HBF) that sequentially updates the joint posterior density of a Bernoulli RFS for the unknown velocity input and the object kinematic state. In addition, the proposed HBF has been customized for maritime anomaly detection by using a piecewise Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) stochastic process as dynamic model of vessels.

"chemical composition and provenance of chinese porcelain shards recovered from old goa, west coast of india","2017","During recent archaeological explorations at Old Goa, west coast of India, twenty three Chinese porcelain shards of the Ming (Middle to late 16th century), Qing (17th century) and late Qing period (late 17th century) have been recovered. In order to understand the nature and source of raw material and kilns, these shards were analysed for major elements with X-ray fluorescence (XRF), trace and rare earth elements by Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS). The analysis suggests that porcelain shards are siliceous in nature (SiO2~70%) and contain high Al2O3 (21.6%), Rb (388ppm) and Ba (160ppm) but have low Sr (48ppm). This composition suggests that the raw materials used for producing porcelain were silica, kaolinite and sericite which are characteristics of porcelains manufactured in Southern China. Comparatively, high Al2O3 (kaolinite) content in porcelains of the Qing Dynasty suggest improvement of quality, particularly mechanical strength, of Jingdezhen porcelain. In general, major element composition, trace metals, total rare earth elements (∑REE-67ppm) and their chondrite - normalized pattern of the Ming, Qing and late Qing period are nearly similar and appear to be made of identical raw materials.","Old Goa,Jingdezhen kiln,Chinese porcelain,Ming and Qing period,South China,Maritime trade,ICP-MS and XRF analysis,"

"optical link design for a maritime radar system","2017","The mast weight is a critical design specification of any maritime vessel and therefore the design of radar must make sure the weight of the system is distributed appropriately. The use of RF on fibre technology gives the radar system designer the ability to shift (and reduce) the weight of the system in a way that is not possible if using standard RF distribution methods. In an RF on fibre link the RF signal is intensity modulated onto an optical carrier and distributed from the mast head to below deck through a multichannel optical rotating joint. The most critical requirements of the optical distribution system are to reduce mast mass, provide high dynamic range, minimise increase in Noise Figure (NF) and exhibit low phase noise even in the presence of vibration.

"hybrid bernoulli filtering for detection and tracking of anomalous path deviations","2018","This paper presents a solution to the problem of sequential joint anomaly detection and tracking of a target subject to switching unknown path deviations. Based on a dynamic model described by Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) stochastic processes, the anomaly is represented by a target (e.g., a marine vessel) that deviates from a preset route by changing its nominal mean velocity. The Random Finite Set (RFS) framework is used to represent the switching nature of target's anomalous behavior in the presence of spurious measurements and detection uncertainty. Combining these two ingredients, the problem of jointly detecting target's path deviations and estimating its kinematic state can be formulated within the Bayesian framework, and analytically solved by means of a hybrid Bernoulli filter that sequentially updates the joint posterior density of the unknown OU velocity input (a Bernoulli RFS) and of the target's state random vector. We illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed filter, implemented in Gaussian-mixture form, in a simulated scenario of vessel tracking for maritime traffic monitoring.","Anomaly detection,switching nature,state random vector,Sea measurements,Stochastic processes,Radio frequency,vessel tracking,hybrid Bernoulli filtering,target tracking,Random Finite Set framework,stochastic processes,filtering theory,hybrid Bernoulli filter,Target tracking,object detection,Gaussian processes,Bayesian framework,Artificial intelligence,anomalous path deviations,unknown OU velocity input,nominal mean velocity,Surveillance,marine vessel,joint posterior density,sequential joint anomaly detection,"
"an adaptive hyper parameter tuning model for ship fuel consumption prediction under complex maritime environments","2022","An accurate prediction of ship fuel consumption is critical for speed, trim, and voyage optimisation etc. While previous studies have focused on predicting ship fuel consumption with respect to a variety of factors, research on the impact of environmental factors on fuel consumption has been lacking. In addition, although recent research efforts have widely focused on machine learning methods to predict fuel consumption, studies on hyperparameter values that are suitable for these prediction models are limited. To compensate for this deficiency in existing literature, an adaptive hyperparameter tuning method is proposed, and the effects of maritime environmental factors on fuel consumption are taken into account. Through experimentation, the proposed adaptive hyperparameter tuning method was validated via artificial neural network (ANN), support vector regression (SVR), random forest (RF), and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso). The hyperparameter tuning proportionally increased the amplitudes of the coefficients of determination (R2) of these algorithms. The increase of the amplitude demonstrated the following trend, in the order of the largest increase to the lowest increase: ANN, Lasso, SVM, and RF. The rates of increase were between 0.0773% and 2.1653%. Furthermore, after the environmental factors were considered, the prediction accuracies of the ANN and Lasso increased; however, the opposite was observed for the SVR and RF. As such, we confirmed that the use of Bayesian optimisation for hyperparameter tuning can effectively improve the fuel consumption prediction accuracy, and our proposed model can therefore serve as a significant reference for calculating fuel consumption.","Bayesian optimization,Hyperparameter tuning,Environmental factors,Ship fuel consumption,Artificial neural network,"
"a data processing method of maritime surveillance radar on mechanical and electronical scanning mode","2020","The maritime surveillance radar is prone to have the problems of false track initiation and tracking loss due to the low tracking accuracy of the target using the traditional data processing strategy. To solve these problems, a data processing strategy is proposed based on a mechanical and electronical scanned radar. As the problem of velocity ambiguity is caused by far detection distance and low pulse repetition frequency (PRF), the overlapping algorithm is used and the corresponding constraints are employed for optimization. The problem of too many false tracks as a result of background noise is solved by using Hough transform and logic-based algorithm optimized under the relevant constraints.

"multi-label classification for ais data anomaly detection using wavelet transform","2022","Thanks to the Automatic Identification System (AIS), ships and other maritime equipment are able to communicate with each other, for example, by sending information about their position. This solution allows for early collision detection when two or more ships are on a collision course. In the newer version of AIS, a satellite infrastructure is used to extend the communication range. Unfortunately, satellite AIS deals with so-called packet collision effect: since there is a problem with synchronizing AIS data coming from multiple terrestrial areas, a single satellite may receive several AIS messages at the same time and be unable to correctly process them, causing the data to get lost or garbled. In this article, a machine learning based framework for detecting the incorrect AIS data is presented. In this approach, after the first stage (clustering), a dedicated anomaly detection algorithm searches for damaged AIS messages and conducts multi-label classification (with Random Forest and wavelet transform) to decide which fields of such message requires further correction. The results of measuring the effectiveness of the proposed approach using real AIS data are presented.","telecommunication security,Clustering algorithms,incorrect AIS data,single satellite,Anomaly detection,Wavelet transforms,anomaly detection,random forests,collision course,Marine vehicles,Machine learning,damaged AIS messages,Data analysis,dedicated anomaly detection algorithm searches,satellite communication,ships,wavelet transform,pattern classification,random forest,Classification algorithms,multiple terrestrial areas,pattern clustering,machine learning based framework,Artificial intelligence,multi-label classification,multilabel classification,wavelet transforms,satellite infrastructure,AIS data anomaly detection,maritime equipment,communication range,Trajectory,marine communication,Labeling,early collision detection,AIS data analysis,packet collision effect,satellite AIS deals,"

This system adds the AIS and four additional services, with challenges in modulation schemes, channel bandwidths and bit rates. The adoption of this new system implies a hardware challenge, because the VDES equipment could be more expensive than current commercial AIS transceivers.

"multifrequency rf-measurements and characterisation of propagation conditions in the maritime boundary layer","2016","In the maritime boundary layer, air-sea interaction processes have an important impact on radar propagation. The radar range performance near the sea surface depends on meteorological and sea surface conditions. Strong gradients of humidity and temperature close to the air-water interface are most often the reason for propagation effects such as ducting. For ship borne radars the evaporation duct is the dominant propagation mechanism affecting the maximum detection range. Ducting can also increase sea clutter return within and beyond the geometric horizon. Duct characteristics (duct heights, duct structures, duct formation behavior, duct existence, duct vertical and horizontal variability) depend on climatic zones and regional peculiarities. In this contribution we report on a RF propagation experiment performed in the North Sea close to the Island of Sylt.

"an artificial intelligence model considering data imbalance for ship selection in port state control based on detention probabilities","2021","Port state control inspection is seen as a safety net to guard marine safety, protect the marine environment, and guarantee decent onboard working and living conditions for seafarers. A substandard ship can be detained in an inspection if serious deficiencies are found onboard. Ship detention is regarded as a severe result in port state control inspection. However, developing accurate prediction models for ship detention based on ship’s generic factors (e.g. ship age, type, and flag), dynamic factors (e.g. times of ship flag changes), and inspection historical factors (e.g. total previous detentions in PSC inspection, last PSC inspection time, and last deficiency number in PSC inspection) before an inspection is conducted is not a trivial task as the low detention rate leads to a highly imbalanced inspection records dataset. To address this issue, this paper develops a classification model called balanced random forest (BRF) to predict ship detention by using 1,600 inspection records at the Hong Kong port for three years. Numerical experiments show that the proposed BRF model can identify 81.25% of all the ships with detention in the test set which contains another 400 inspection records. Compared with the current ship selection method at the Hong Kong port, the BRF model is much more efficient and can achieve an average improvement of 73.72% in detained ship identification.","imbalanced data,machine learning in maritime transportation,ship detention,Port state control inspection,artificial intelligence in maritime transportation,"

"distribution of sulfur aerosol precursors in the spcz released by continuous volcanic degassing at ambrym, vanuatu","2016","The Melanesian Volcanic Arc (MVA) emits about 12kTd−1 of sulfur dioxide (SO2) to the atmosphere from continuous passive (non-explosive) volcanic degassing, which contributes 20% of the global SO2 emission from volcanoes. Here we assess, from up-to-date and long-term observations, the SO2 emission of the Ambrym volcano, one of the dominant volcanoes in the MVA, and we investigate its role as sulfate precursor on the regional distribution of aerosols, using both satellite observations and model results at 1°×1° spatial resolution from WRF-Chem/GOCART. Without considering aerosol forcing on clouds, our model parameterizations for convection, vertical mixing and cloud properties provide a reliable chemical weather representation, making possible a cross-examination of model solution and observations. This preliminary work enables the identification of biases and limitations affecting both the model (missing sources) and satellite sensors and algorithms (for aerosol detection and classification) and leads to the implementation of improved transport and aerosol processes in the modeling system. On the one hand, the model confirms a 50% underestimation of SO2 emissions due to satellite swath sampling of the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI), consistent with field studies. The OMI irregular sampling also produces a level of noise that impairs its monitoring capacity during short-term volcanic events. On the other hand, the model reveals a large sensitivity on aerosol composition and Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) due to choices of both the source function in WRF-Chem and size parameters for sea-salt in FlexAOD, the post-processor used to compute offline the simulated AOD. We then proceed to diagnosing the role of SO2 volcanic emission in the regional aerosol composition. The model shows that both dynamics and cloud properties associated with the South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ) have a large influence on the oxidation of SO2 and on the transport pathways of volcanic species across the South Pacific atmosphere. For example, in the tropical cloudy air, the sulfate production in the aqueous phase is very efficient, resulting in the formation of a large cloud of highly scattering sulfate aerosols advected horizontally to Eastern Indonesia, in agreement with the AOD feature captured by MODIS/Aqua, but missed in CALIOP/CALIPSO (lidar) products. Model sensitivity experiments indicate that aerosol re-suspension due to evaporating droplets is a significant pathway for the supply of volcanic sulfur species in the remote marine boundary layer. By strongly modulating the irreversible loss due to wet scavenging, this aerosol process has a similar influence on the sulfur burden as natural emission from volcanoes or biogenic sources like dimethyl sulfate (DMS). The results emphasize the importance of MVA passive degassing and SPCZ dynamics on the aerosol background, and raise questions about potential impacts on the local climate and marine ecosystems.","Volcanic plume impacts,Aerosol modeling,SO dispersal,SPCZ dynamics,Remote sensing,Regional aerosol climatology,"
"detection of invalid ais messages using machine learning techniques","2022","Coastal nations monitor maritime activities in the interest of defence, security, and safety. This form of monitoring typically occurs at operations centers that visualize the maritime environment by creating a Recognized Maritime Picture (RMP) covering a particular area of interest. The creation of this picture changed drastically with the introduction of the Automatic Identification System (AIS). AIS messages are known to contain numerous types of errors and in April 2020 a unique error was found in the data stream. This error consisted of messages indicating the appearance of over 200 vessels in the North Atlantic taking part in a yacht race when in fact no race or physical ships existed. The following work explores the application of various machine learning (ML) techniques to help identify these types of fabricated AIS messages. Specific ML techniques were explored including: K-means clustering, Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Feed-Forward Neural Networks (FNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and One-Class Support Vector Machines (One-SVM). The results showed that DT, RF, and FNN best identified the fabricated AIS messages with F1 scores greater than 93 percent on the test data.","maritime domain awareness,AIS,automatic identification system,machine learning,"
"ais data-driven ship trajectory prediction modelling and analysis based on machine learning and deep learning methods","2023","Maritime transport faces new safety challenges in an increasingly complex traffic environment caused by large-scale and high-speed ships, particularly with the introduction of intelligent and autonomous ships. It is evident that Automatic Identification System (AIS) data-driven ship trajectory prediction can effectively aid in identifying abnormal ship behaviours and reducing maritime risks such as collision, stranding, and contact. Furthermore, trajectory prediction is widely recognised as one of the critical technologies for realising safe autonomous navigation. The prediction methods and their performance are the key factors for future safe and automatic shipping. Currently, ship trajectory prediction lacks the real performance measurement and analysis of different algorithms, including classical machine learning and emerging deep learning methods. This paper aims to systematically analyse the performance of ship trajectory prediction methods and pioneer experimental tests to reveal their advantages and disadvantages as well as fitness in different scenarios involving complicated systems. To do so, five machine learning methods (i.e., Kalman Filter (KF), Support Vector Progression (SVR), Back Propagation network (BP), Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), and Random Forest (RF)) and seven deep learning methods (i.e., Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gate Recurrent Unit (GRU), Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM), Sequence to Sequence (Seq2seq), Bi-directional Gate Recurrent Unit (Bi-GRU), and Transformer) are first extracted from the state-of-the-art literature review and then employed to implement the trajectory prediction and compare their prediction performance in the real world. Three AIS datasets are collected from the waters of representative traffic features, including a normal channel (i.e., the Chengshan Jiao Promontory), complex traffic (i.e., the Zhoushan Archipelago), and a port area (i.e., Caofeidian port). They are selected to test and analyse the performance of all twelve methods based on six evaluation indexes and explore the characteristics and effectiveness of the twelve trajectory prediction methods in detail. The experimental results provide a novel perspective, comparison, and benchmark for ship trajectory prediction research, which not only demonstrates the fitness of each method in different maritime traffic scenarios, but also makes significant contributions to maritime safety and autonomous shipping development.","Deep learning,Maritime safety,Trajectory prediction,AIS data,Machine learning,"

The chief solution is to safe guard these fishermen from the danger which they are encountering in everyday life for their livelihood. Hence, keeping the above problems in mind, this paper proposes a GPS based boat detection and tracking system which would safe guard the fishermen from the potential dangers they might face by giving them pre-warning in case of trespassing. In particular, we are proposing to control the navigation so that the fishermen are directed to safe region. This system was designed and demonstrated already.

"bayesian filtering for dynamic anomaly detection and tracking","2022","This article presents a Bayesian approach for sequential detection of anomalies in the motion of a target and joint tracking. The anomaly is modeled as a binary (on/off) switching unknown control input that goes into action (begins to exist, or â€œswitches onâ€) thereby modifying the object dynamics; and by ceasing its activity (becoming nonexistent, or â€œswitching offâ€) returns the dynamics to nominal. The developed Bayesian framework brings together random finite set (RFS) theory to represent the switching nature of the anomaly, and optimal joint input and state estimation to sequentially update a hybrid state that incorporates a random vector for the kinematic state and a Bernoulli RFS for the unknown control input. In addition, a closed-form solution, the Gaussian-mixture hybrid Bernoulli filter (GM-HBF), has been developed to provide a customized solution for dynamic anomaly detection in the maritime domain characterized by linear Gaussian target dynamics. Based on the Ornsteinâ€“Uhlenbeck dynamic model for vessels, where the evolution of the object velocity is governed by a piecewise mean-reverting stochastic process, the anomaly can be represented by a change in the long-run mean velocity (i.e., the unknown control input) from the nominal condition that forces the vessel to deviate from its standard route. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed GM-HBF in both simulated and real-world maritime surveillance applications and test its performance in the face of false measurements, detection uncertainty, and sensor data gaps.","developed Bayesian framework,surveillance,kinematic state,Mathematical models,Anomaly detection,Automatic identification system (AIS),Bayesian approach,random finite sets (RFSs),Bayesian filtering,Bayes methods,object dynamics,linear Gaussian target dynamics,Switches,Bernoulli filter,switching unknown control input,Radio frequency,target tracking,Aerodynamics,stochastic processes,filtering theory,radar,state estimation,detection uncertainty,Gaussian processes,Bernoulli RFS,Radar tracking,maritime anomaly detection,dynamic anomaly detection,joint input and state estimation (JISE),probability,Ornstein-Uhlenbeck dynamic model,GM-HBF,Gaussian-mixture hybrid Bernoulli filter,"

"maritime information integration based on rfid middleware","2014","To meet the actual demand of maritime container transportation and management, an information integration model and sharing mechanism based on RFID middleware is proposed by analyzing maritime multivariate data heterogeneity. The model consists of maritime supply chain RFID middleware model, RFID middleware integrated model, XML data exchange interface and XML-based information exchange. XML is defined as the basis for data integration and information exchange data solution. The paper deals particularly with the marine enterprise information exchange based on XML and achieve a significant performance improvement over state-of-the-art information exchange model.","XML data exchange interface,maritime information integration,Radiofrequency identification,maritime supply chain,maritime container transportation,maritime container management,extensible markup language,data exchange,Supply chains,information management,Data models,information integration model,radiofrequency identification,Middleware,XML-based information exchange,maritime multivariate data heterogeneity,logistics data processing,information sharing mechanism,XML,RFID middleware,data integration,ontology,Information exchange,middleware,"
"characterization of maritime rf/fso channel","2011","The growing demand on high speed data transmission as well as the bandwidth limitation of microwave (RF) transmission has stimulated the development of free-space optical (FSO) laser communication links during the last years. Making the data transmission reliable is one of the challenging problems that have to be solved to establish a communication system suitable for commercial usage. Optical transmission is highly impacted by different channel conditions, leading from signal damping to turbulence effects due to the atmosphere. In this paper a hybrid RF/FSO maritime channel is investigated. The link distance under investigation is about 14 km. Transmitted data collected during a 6 months measurement campaign is evaluated and theoretically analyzed. The correlation between weather and atmospheric impacts to the large amount of RF and FSO transmission data available, will provide an insight into the capability of estimating channel quality.","telecommunication network reliability,Absorption,atmospheric turbulence,high speed data transmission,optical links,Radio frequency,bandwidth limitation,free-space optical laser communication links,data transmission reliability,Atmospheric modeling,Scattering,data communication,Attenuation,hybrid RF-FSO maritime channel,signal damping,atmosphere turbulence effect,wireless channels,marine communication,Rain,microwave transmission,Damping,optical transmission,"
"a lightweight and extensible complex event processing system for sense and respond applications","2012","Complex Event Processing (CEP) is considered as a promising technology for enabling the evolution of service-oriented enterprise systems towards operational aware systems. CEP effectively supports the implementation of “sense and respond” behaviours, as it enables to extract meaningful events from raw data streams originated by sensing infrastructures, for enterprise processes and applications consumption. This paper proposes a novel CEP engine conceived with ease of use, extensibility, portability, and scalability requirements in mind. More specifically, we propose a Lightweight Stage-based Event Processor (LiSEP) based on a layered architectural design. Thanks to the adoption of Staged Event-Driven Architecture principles, core event processing logic is decoupled from low-level thread management issues. This results in an easy-to-understand and extensible implementation while testing results show performance scalability. We report on the carrying out of a case study on dangerous goods monitoring in maritime transport. The objective of the case study is to develop a Proof of Concept application leveraging on LiSEP capabilities in sensor and RFID events processing for monitoring and alerting purposes.","Complex Event Processing,Staged Event-Driven Architecture,Sense and respond applications,Event processing declarative language,Goods monitoring,"
