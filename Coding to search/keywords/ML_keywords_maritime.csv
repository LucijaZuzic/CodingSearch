"a semi-supervised deep learning approach for vessel trajectory classification based on ais data","2022","Automatic identification system (AIS) refers to a new type of navigation aid system equipped in maritime vehicles to monitor ship performance. It provides trajectory information of vessels which can be used for the classification task. The classification results facilitate ocean surveillance and conservation, vessel management enhancement, fishery regulation, marine ecological sustainability, and nautical safety protection. Some progresses have been made based on machine learning or deep learning strategies to perform supervised learning by assuming that during the training process, the category labels of historical trajectory data are available. However, in reality, the label information may be difficult or expensive to obtain, resulting in that only a small part of the training data is labeled, and most of the training data is unlabeled. To address this issue, this paper proposes a semi-supervised deep learning approach to integrate the knowledge of unlabeled data for vessel trajectory classification. Here, we call our approach SSL-VTC. Specifically, we first extract vessel trajectories by integrating the kinematic and static information from historical AIS messages. Then, we design convolutional neural networks to extract feature representations from the vessel trajectories. Finally, we develop a semi-supervised learning algorithm based on the variational autoencoder to perform discriminative learning and generative learning simultaneously. In this way, our SSL-VTC framework can fully leverage the labeled data and unlabeled data during the training process. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to utilize semi-supervised learning for vessel trajectory classification. Experimental results on the public AIS dataset show that our SSL-VTC can effectively extract feature representations from the AIS messages and its performance is significantly better than the traditional supervised learning methods. The approach and findings of this study provide important implications for researchers and stakeholders in the field of ocean management.","Vessel trajectory classification,Variational autoencoder,Deep learning,Semi-supervised learning,Automatic identification system,"

"online learning of temporal logic formulae for signal classification","2018","This paper introduces a method for online inference of temporal logic properties from data. Specifically, we tackle the online supervised learning problem. In this setting, the data is in form of a set of pairs of signals and labels and it becomes available over time. We propose an approach for efficiently processing the data incrementally. In particular, when a new instance is presented, the proposed method updates a binary tree that is linked with the inferred Signal Temporal Logic (STL) formula. This approach presents several benefits. Primarily, it allows the refinement of the current formula when more data is acquired. Moreover, the incremental construction offers insights on the trade-off between formula complexity and classification accuracy. We present two case studies to emphasize the characteristics of the proposed algorithm: 1) a fault classification problem in an automotive system and 2) an anomaly detection problem in the maritime environment.","anomaly detection problem,Prediction algorithms,Machine learning,temporal logic formulae,temporal logic,signal classification,signal temporal logic formula,automotive system,Decision trees,formula complexity,trees (mathematics),Impurities,STL,temporal logic properties,Binary trees,Complexity theory,online supervised learning problem,inference mechanisms,maritime environment,incremental construction,Task analysis,binary tree,online inference,learning (artificial intelligence),fault classification problem,"
"a comparative investigation of data-driven approaches based on one-class classifiers for condition monitoring of marine machinery system","2020","The safety and reliability of ship navigation depend heavily on the performance of the marine machinery system, which can be maintained at a high level by condition based maintenance. Intelligent condition monitoring is the key to achieve condition based maintenance. However, it is not easy to realize intelligent condition monitoring in a real ship, because there are not enough labeled fault samples to train an accurate detection model. In fact, the potential value of a large number of normal samples collected by the shipboard monitoring system has not been mined out. Since one-class classifiers only need one-class samples to train the detection models, they are very suitable for such occasions. In this paper, we investigate the performance of several representative one-class classifiers, such as OCSVM (One class support vector machine), SVDD (Support vector data description), GKNN (Global k-nearest neighbors), LOF (Local outlier factor), IForest (Isolation forest) and ABOD (Angle-based outlier detection), in condition monitoring of the marine machinery system. The dataset of a marine gas turbine propulsion system is used for a case study, which is a simulation dataset verified by the real ship data. Compared with previous literatures, our new work is to investigate the performance of a variety of key one-class classifiers, not only considering the common evaluation indexes for machine learning, but also considering the sample combinations of the training dataset, distribution of misclassified samples, and the tolerance to contaminated data. The experimental results show that these algorithms have good performance in the dataset in some common evaluation indexes. However, they show some obvious performance differences in some novel evaluation indexes we proposed. This can provide decision support for the application of one-class classifiers in the condition monitoring of many other marine machinery systems.","One-class classifier,Marine machinery,Condition based maintenance,Condition monitoring,"
"generating bunkering statistics from ais data: a machine learning approach","2021","In shipping, the optimization of the bunkering location is dependent on price, deviation from the planned route and the cost of delays incurred by the bunkering operation itself. Despite their potential importance, detailed statistics for bunkering operations at the individual port call level (e.g. waiting times, barge capacity, location - anchorage or terminal) are not available. I develop a new method, based on the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm, that can a) identify tanker vessels used as bunkering tankers, b) detect stationary ocean-going vessels at anchorage or alongside terminals and c) automatically recognize bunkering operations as a rendezvous between an ocean-going vessel and a bunkering barge. I find that the high time complexity of the DBSCAN algorithm in this setting can be compensated by adjusting the algorithm to distributed computer settings. In the empirical study, I use the output to describe the relative importance of Mediterranean ports for bunkering and provide statistics on waiting and servicing times. The empirical findings are important for the optimization of the bunkering location decision in shipping and studies on regional port competitiveness.","Bunkering operations,Bunkering statistics,DBSCAN,Machine learning,Spatial recognition,"
"comparison of ship detection algorithms using alos-palsar, ground-based maritime radar, and ais","2011","MLCC (Multi-Look Cross-Correlation) is a useful technique to extract the images of ships embedded in sea clutter from SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) data. However, the previous MLCC has a difficulty of detecting small ships since SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio) is not high enough. Therefore, we developed a new Improved MLCC (IMLCC) to increase SNR to extract small boats. Although the IMLCC method increased SNR, there still remained some highly correlated noises in the coherence images caused by strong radar backscatter from sea surface. In order to improve the IMLCC algorithm further, we propose a new method of applying Lognormal-CFAR (Constant False Alarm Rate) to IMLCC coherence images. The results using ALOS-PALSAR (Advanced Land Observing Satellite-Phased Array L-band SAR) data showed substantial improvement in SNR and detection rate.","ALOS-PALSAR,lognormal-CFAR,marine radar,Coherence,radar detection,CFAR,radar clutter,radar backscatter,ship detection algorithm,Marine vehicles,sea surface,ground-based maritime radar,phased array radar,SAR,Synthetic aperture radar,AIS,IMLCC method,synthetic aperture radar,multilook cross correlation,IMLCC algorithm,radar imaging,Correlation,correlated noise,IMLCC,correlation methods,constant false alarm rate,Azimuth,coherence image,Ship detection,MLCC,Visualization,radar polarimetry,Signal to noise ratio,advanced land observing satellite- phased array L-band SAR,ship SNR,backscatter,"
"reliability analysis with corrosion defects in submarine pipeline case study: oil pipeline in ab-khark island","2022","The offshore industry widely uses offshore pipelines to transport petroleum products due to their high capacity and reasonable installation costs. Corrosion is the leading failure cause of offshore pipelines, and their reliability analysis is necessary for reducing maintenance costs. This study presents a corrosion analysis in the bursting mode of the pipeline using a codified method based on probabilistic space theory, considering the monitored data of the oil pipeline and the pigging data of the AB-KHARK pipeline. The relationship between pigging data, parameters affecting corrosion, and the reduction of pipe wall thickness are determined based on the indicators of Regression and Neural Network machine learning methods. A new method is presented for modeling the failure modes of offshore pipelines based on their historical data and statistical computation results. Finally, the system is investigated by the first-order reliability method considering the limit state function provided by evaluating the offshore pipeline reliability.

"learning ship activity patterns in maritime data streams: enhancing cep rule learning by temporal and spatial relations and domain-specific functions","2023","Maritime surveillance systems are of particular importance for the smooth and safe operation of maritime traffic. Such systems must efficiently analyze the continuous stream of incoming ship movement data to provide an up-to-date picture of the situation at sea. Complex Event Processing (CEP) is a software technology dedicated to the analysis of data streams in real time and seems to be promising for maritime surveillance as well. CEP is based on rules that usually have to be formulated manually by domain experts. Recently, several approaches of learning CEP rules have been proposed. However, all these approaches are limited to standard CEP rule languages which are not well suited for describing maritime situations. In this paper, we extend Bat4CEP, an innovative bat-inspired approach to automatic CEP rule learning, to meet the specific needs of the maritime domain. In particular, we extend the rule language of Bat4CEP to include temporal-spatial operators and domain-specific functions. This extended rule language makes it possible to express complex maritime facts in a simple and understandable form. Furthermore, it is shown how the proposed rule language extensions can be integrated into the Bat4CEP learning approach. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated through extensive experiments with real maritime data streams.","Seaports,metaheuristics,Metaheuristics,Standards,Artificial intelligence,Maritime transportation,Surveillance,interpretable AI,Real-time systems,complex event processing,Marine vehicles,maritime data analytics,machine learning,"

"imitating radar operator decisions for maritime surveillance missions using bayesian networks","2019","This paper presents the use of Bayesian networks for learning decisions made by a human radar operator carrying out a maritime surveillance mission. By imitating the operator's decisions, a significant increase in the autonomy of a radar surveillance system can be achieved as well as potentially streamlining the qualification process. For maritime scenarios, current literature has only focused on using a Bayesian network (BN) for identification and assessment, and often assumes inputs from a generic surveillance sensor. Furthermore, in both the maritime surveillance and radar operations domain, there has been no investigation into using the operator's data in order to learn the decisions made throughout the mission. This paper uses a realtime radar simulation in order to obtain the scenario and radar information that would be observed by a human operator. In conjunction with a user interface, the simulation is further used to obtain operator decisions for a given mission with the maximum likelihood approach used to obtain the BN probabilities. The BN is then used in place of the operator for interfacing with the simulation in order to test the suitability of this method. Several typical scenarios are used to demonstrate the BN's operational ability relative to that of the operator. Additionally, the required data size for sufficient performance is investigated.","radar surveillance system,surveillance,Bayes methods,radar operations domain,belief networks,Bayesian networks,human radar operator,realtime radar simulation,maritime scenarios,radar operator decisions,target tracking,learning decisions,radar computing,machine learning,radar information,Graphical user interfaces,generic surveillance sensor,Radar tracking,Artificial intelligence,maritime surveillance mission,radar tracking,Airborne radar,probability,Bayesian network,Surveillance,Task analysis,imitation learning,learning (artificial intelligence),"

"application of machine learning methods in maritime safety information classification","2018","In order to ensure the safety of maritime navigation, International Maritime Organization (IMO) developed the Global Maritime Distress and Safety System (GMDSS), which includes an important Maritime Safety Information (MSI) Broadcasting System that can broadcast navigational warnings and other crucial information. However, in most sea areas, the broadcast messages are still not pre-classified. Seafarers need to identify the theme of those received messages artificially, with low efficiency and accuracy. To solve this problem, several machine-learning based solutions are presented, implemented, and compared. Thousands of Navigational Telex (NAVTEX) messages, from 2011 to 2017, are used in the training and evaluation progress. The classifiers are compared in terms of accuracy, efficiency, precision and recall rate, and F-Measure respectively; and one of them is chosen as the optimal classifier. The chosen classifier performs well on solving the NAVTEX classification problem, and may further be used in other similar problems.","Maritime Safety Information,maritime safety information classification,Navigational Telex messages,Safety,Prediction algorithms,navigational warnings,marine navigation,Global Maritime Distress and Safety System,machine-learning based solutions,Decision trees,e-Navigation,marine safety,marine engineering,International Maritime Organization,maritime navigation,Broadcasting System,pattern classification,NAVTEX classification problem,Navigational Warning,Logistics,Forestry,Training,Machine Learning,marine communication,Navigation,Classification,learning (artificial intelligence),radionavigation,"
"an enhanced intelligent model: to protect marine iot sensor environment using ensemble machine learning approach","2021","The research in marine sensors and the Internet of Things (IoT) has grown exponentially with the ample warehouse of natural materials in the sea. The growing activities in the marine sensor environment increased the threat of anomalies and cyber-attacks. Many Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and classical machine learning-based models have been proposed to secure the sensor-based IoT infrastructure. Still, these mechanisms have failed to achieve significant results for securing the marine sensor environment due to the discriminant requirements of the IoT appliances in deep oceans, such as distribution, information complexity, scalability, higher network bandwidth requirements, and low computational capacity. Hence, we propose a lightweight and robust ensemble model to secure the marine IoT environment from cyber-attacks and malicious activities. This paper established an optimized Light Gradient Boosting Machine (Light-GBM) algorithm for ocean IoT attack detection. The experiments were conducted on Distributed Smart Space Orchestration System (DS2OS) dataset. The proposed methodology includes a label encoding technique for best feature selection, hyper-parameter tuning, ensemble function, and a novel algorithm to develop an ocean IoT attack detection model. As an extension of traditional methods, the optimized Light-GBM model can handle the distributed IoT attacks in the deeper marine environments with low computational cost and with 98.52% detection accuracy. The comparative analysis confirms the effectiveness of the proposed model for marine sensor safety. Conclusively, the proposed model mitigates the threat of cyber-attacks in the marine sensor environment and presenting a promising future in real-time ocean-based IoT applications.","Marine data safety,Sensor-based infrastructure,Light-GBM,Internet of things (IoT),Machine learning,Ensemble-learning,"
"towards a convolutional neural network model for classifying regional ship collision risk levels for waterway risk analysis","2020","Estimating the navigational risk of vessels operating in sea and waterway areas is important for waterway risk management and pollution preparedness and response planning. Existing methods relying on a model-informed expert judgment of ship-ship collision risk are of limited practical use because periodic risk monitoring is feasible only when this can be done without extensive use of organizational resources. To alleviate such limitations, this article presents a new approach based Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and image recognition to interpret and classify ship-ship collision risks in encounter scenarios. The specific aim of the article is to investigate whether a CNN-based model can quickly and accurately interpret images constructed based on data from the Automatic Identification System (AIS) in terms of collision risk. To test this, estimates derived from training data are compared to validation data. It is also investigated whether adding additional navigational information based on AIS data improves the model's predictive accuracy. A case study with data from the Baltic Sea area is implemented, where various model design alternatives are tested as a proof-of-concept. The main finding of this work is that a CNN-based approach can indeed meet the specified design requirements, suggesting that this is a fruitful direction for future work. Several issues requiring further research and developed are discussed, with the validity of the risk ratings underlying the image classification seen as the most significant conceptual challenge before a CNN-model can be put to practical use.","Image recognition,Maritime Safety,Convolutional Neural Network,Ship-ship collision,AIS data,Machine learning,"
"emerging approaches applied to maritime transport research: past and future","2021","Maritime transport is the backbone of international trade and globalization. Maritime transport research can be roughly divided into two categories, namely the shipping side and the port side. Most of the classic approaches adopted to address practical problems in these research topics are based on long-term observations and expert knowledge, while few of them are based on historical data accumulated from practice. In recent years, emerging approaches, which we refer to as machine learning and deep learning techniques in this essay, have been receiving a wider attention to solve practical problems. As a relatively conservative industry, there are some initial trials of applying the emerging approaches to solve practical problems in the maritime sector. The objective of this essay is to review the application of emerging approaches to maritime transport research. The main research topics in maritime transport and classic methods developed to solve them are first presented. The introduction of emerging approaches and their suitability to be applied in maritime transport research is then discussed. Related existing studies are then reviewed according to problem settings, main data sources, and emerging approaches adopted. Challenges and solutions in the process are also discussed from the perspectives of data, model, users, and targets. Finally, promising future research directions are identified.

"new frontiers in the risk assessment of ship collision","2023","Navigation is becoming more and more complex over the years. The increase in maritime traffic and vessel size is inducing a global escalation of ship collision accidents, with consequent losses of human lives and economic assets worth billions. This is particularly true for port basins, with maritime authorities struggling worldwide to keep up with the ever-increasing ship traffic. In this respect, the demand for advanced methods to assess and mitigate ship collision risk has never been higher. The interdependency between physical failures, weather conditions, logistics, governance and human factors requires sophisticated frameworks to effectively assist maritime authorities and navigators in decision-making. The present work reviews the most recent advancements in the risk assessment of ship collision. The article focuses on new, rising technologies, identifying the current main trends and discussing future perspectives and challenges. The review revealed a wide and diversified range of methods, including machine learning, clustering techniques, swarm intelligence algorithms and others. To frame the methods in the current literature and compare them with previous efforts, they are categorized according to literature classifications. Advancements of well-established approaches and new promising tools are discussed, considering methods that allow the inclusion of quantitative and qualitative variables in the assessment. Furthermore, a comprehensive analysis of a database of maritime accidents in port areas is carried out to investigate prevailing trends in both worldwide and Mediterranean Sea contexts. Results indicate that ship collision accidents constitute the majority compared with other types of accidents, especially in the Mediterranean.","Collision avoidance,Swarm intelligence,Neural network,Bayesian network,Maritime safety,Navigation risk,"

"machine learning and data-driven fault detection for ship systems operations","2020","Well maintained vessels exhibit high reliability, safety and energy efficiency. Even though machinery failures are inevitable, their occurrence can be foreseen when predictive maintenance schemes are implemented. Predictive maintenance may be optimally applied through condition, performance, and process monitoring. Most importantly, it can include the detection of developing faults, which affect the performance of ship systems and hinder energy-efficient operations of ships. Under this viewpoint, this paper proposes a new data-driven fault detection methodology in a novel application for shipboard systems, by exploring the “learning potential” of recorded voyage data. The proposed methodology, combines the benefits of Expected Behaviour (EB) models, by selecting the optimal regression model, with the Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) for fault detection, in novel ship applications. It is seen that a multiple polynomial ridge regression model, with testing R2score of nearly 0.96 and can accurately detect certain developing faults manifesting in both the Main Engine (ME) cylinder Exhaust Gas (EG) temperature and the ME scavenging air pressure. The early detection of developing faults can be used to supplement the daily monitoring of ship operations and enable the planning of pre-emptive rectifying actions by reducing sub-optimal machinery conditions.","Pre-processing,Fault detection,Ship machinery systems,Expected behaviour,Machine learning,Ship operations,"

"vessel detection in video with dynamic maritime background","2012","Automating the detection of non-cooperative vessels in surveillance video is challenging. First, the detection algorithm has to handle a large degree of appearance variation of vessels with respect to shape, size and viewing geometry.

"machine learning-assisted anomaly detection in maritime navigation using ais data","2020","The automatic identification system (AIS) reports vessels' static and dynamic information, which are essential for maritime traffic situation awareness. However, AIS transponders can be switched off to hide suspicious activities, such as illegal fishing, or piracy. Therefore, this paper uses real world AIS data to analyze the possibility of successful detection of various anomalies in the maritime domain. We propose a multi-class artificial neural network (ANN)-based anomaly detection framework to classify intentional and non-intentional AIS on-off switching anomalies. The multi-class anomaly framework captures AIS message dropouts due to various reasons, e.g., channel effects or intentional one for carrying illegal activities. We extract position, speed, course and timing information from real world AIS data, and use them to train a 2-class (normal and anomaly) and a 3-class (normal, power outage and anomaly) anomaly detection models. Our results show that the models achieve around 99.9% overall accuracy, and are able to classify a test sample in the order of microseconds.","security of data,maritime traffic situation awareness,multiclass anomaly framework,pattern classification,multiclass artificial neural network,AIS message dropouts,neural nets,illegal fishing,learning (artificial intelligence),illegal activities,ships,automatic identification system,marine engineering,machine learning-assisted anomaly detection,maritime navigation,AIS transponders,"
"validation of xai explanations for multivariate time series classification in the maritime domain","2022","Due to the lack of explanation towards their internal mechanism, state-of-the-art deep learning-based classifiers are often considered as black-box models. For instance, in the maritime domain, models that classify the types of ships based on their trajectories and other features perform well, but give no further explanation for their predictions. To gain the trust of human operators responsible for critical decisions, the reason behind the classification is crucial. In this paper, we introduce explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) approaches to the task of classification of ship types. This supports decision-making by providing explanations in terms of the features contributing the most towards the prediction, along with their corresponding time intervals. In the case of the LIME explainer, we adapt the time-slice mapping technique (LimeforTime), while for Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) and path integrated gradient (PIG), we represent the relevance of each input variable to generate a heatmap as an explanation. In order to validate the XAI results, the existing perturbation and sequence analyses for classifiers of univariate time series data is employed for testing and evaluating the XAI explanations on multivariate time series. Furthermore, we introduce a novel evaluation technique to assess the quality of explanations yielded by the chosen XAI method.","Explainability,Interpretability,Multivariate time series,Maritime domain,Machine learning,Black-box,"
"marine vehicle tracking using agile maritime iots","2021","Marine surveillance deals with the complex problem of modeling and estimating natural and human processes while operating with limited information acquisition resources. The complexity of the problem and the scarcity of resources, such as power, processing, and communications, requires agile distributed sensing and computing that provides scalability, diversity in information acquisition, and adaptive allocation of limited resources. This work deals with tracking multiple marine vehicles using data from heterogeneous sensors. Accurate tracking is achieved by a synergy between a network of agile maritime IoTs, with limited processing resources, and a fusion center, with computationally intensive capability. The IoTs can reconfigure their elementary processing operations settings to produce informative yet low volume measurement statistics. The fusion center handles heterogeneous data fusion and solves the complex problem of vehicle state estimation.

"an adaptive hyper parameter tuning model for ship fuel consumption prediction under complex maritime environments","2022","An accurate prediction of ship fuel consumption is critical for speed, trim, and voyage optimisation etc. While previous studies have focused on predicting ship fuel consumption with respect to a variety of factors, research on the impact of environmental factors on fuel consumption has been lacking. In addition, although recent research efforts have widely focused on machine learning methods to predict fuel consumption, studies on hyperparameter values that are suitable for these prediction models are limited. To compensate for this deficiency in existing literature, an adaptive hyperparameter tuning method is proposed, and the effects of maritime environmental factors on fuel consumption are taken into account. Through experimentation, the proposed adaptive hyperparameter tuning method was validated via artificial neural network (ANN), support vector regression (SVR), random forest (RF), and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso). The hyperparameter tuning proportionally increased the amplitudes of the coefficients of determination (R2) of these algorithms. The increase of the amplitude demonstrated the following trend, in the order of the largest increase to the lowest increase: ANN, Lasso, SVM, and RF. The rates of increase were between 0.0773% and 2.1653%. Furthermore, after the environmental factors were considered, the prediction accuracies of the ANN and Lasso increased; however, the opposite was observed for the SVR and RF. As such, we confirmed that the use of Bayesian optimisation for hyperparameter tuning can effectively improve the fuel consumption prediction accuracy, and our proposed model can therefore serve as a significant reference for calculating fuel consumption.","Bayesian optimization,Hyperparameter tuning,Environmental factors,Ship fuel consumption,Artificial neural network,"
"intrusion detection for maritime transportation systems with batch federated aggregation","2023","As a fast-growing and promising technology, Internet of Things (IoT) significantly promotes the informationization and intelligentization of Maritime Transportation System (MTS). The massive data collected during the voyage is usually disposed of with the assistance of cloud or edge computing, which imposes serious cyber security threats. For multifarious cyber-attacks, Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is one of the efficient mechanisms to prevent IoT devices from network intrusion. However, most of the methods based on deep learning train their models in a centralized manner, which needs uploading all data to the central server for training, increasing the risk of privacy disclosure. In this paper, we consider the characteristics of IoT-based MTS and propose a CNN-MLP based model for intrusion detection which is trained through Federated Learning, named FedBatch. Federated Learning keeps the model training local and only updates the global model through the exchange of model parameters, preserving the privacy of local data on vessels. First, the characteristics of the communication between different vessels are discussed to model the federated learning process during the voyage. Then, the lightweight local model constructed by Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Multi-Layer Perception (MLP) is designed to save on computing and storage overhead. Moreover, to mitigate the straggler problem during the federated learning in MTS, we proposed an adaptive aggregation method, named Batch Federated Aggregation, which suppresses the oscillations of model parameters during federated learning. Finally, the simulation results on the NSL-KDD dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of FedBatch.","Maritime Transportation System,CNN-MLP based model,computer network security,federated learning process,IoT,Collaborative work,deep learning (artificial intelligence),serious cyber security threats,maritime transportation systems,Internet of Things,cloud,security of data,multifarious cyber-attacks,privacy preservation,Maritime Transportation systems,deep learning,Servers,lightweight local model,model training local,Data models,massive data,network intrusion,voyage,edge computing,federated learning,IoT-based MTS,adaptive aggregation method,multilayer perceptrons,convolutional neural nets,model parameters,Training,Convolutional neural networks,Intrusion detection,Intrusion Detection System,named Batch Federated Aggregation,IoT devices,learning (artificial intelligence),data privacy,global model,"
"ocean of things : affordable maritime sensors with scalable analysis","2019","DARPA's Ocean of Things (OoT) program enables persistent maritime situational awareness over large ocean areas by deploying thousands of low-cost, intelligent floats that drift as a distributed sensor network. Each float manages a suite of commercially available sensors to collect environmental data such as sea surface temperature, sea state, and location as well as activity data about vessels and marine mammals moving across the ocean. The floats periodically transmit processed data, or immediately report events based on internal prioritization schemes. Messages travel via commercial satellite to a government cloud for storage and real-time analysis. Cloud-based data analytics feature machine learning aimed at discovering emergent features and behaviors from sparse data.

"a review of maritime spatio-temporal data analytics","2021","The vessels in maritime regions need to be specifically monitored and assessed since they play an important role in environment, safety, economy and security. One of the technologies that has been developed to monitor vessels that are sailing is Automatic Identification System (AIS). While AISâ€™s initial purpose was to provide automatic reporting between ships, it is now a primary source of worldwide information of maritime vessels. The navigational data that is transmitted by the vessels over AIS falls under the category of spatio-temporal data, which implies that it includes the dimension of space as well as time. This added dimension of time gives considerable insight into the information that can be ascertained from the data, however, at the expense of added complexity in analysis. Two of the major application areas that are being analysed are Maritime Surveillance and Maritime Spatial Planning. Both of these try to gain insights from AIS data to enhance the available information in their context. Analysing this requires various data analytic techniques to be applied to it.

"sensing and automation in the future maritime environment","2020","In this emerging era of great power competition, the goal of outpacing potential adversaries in the development of military technology takes on a new urgency. Evolving capabilities in sensing and automation are driven by a trade space that includes range and lethality versus close engagement and survivability; finders versus hiders; centralized command/control versus asset independence/dispersion; and planning and judgement versus reaction and autonomy.

"learning for prediction of maritime collision avoidance behavior from ais network","2021","With the rapid increase in global maritime shipping, there is a great demand for the technology of maritime traffic monitoring to detect inappropriate encountering interaction between ships and prevent ship collision accidents. The Automatic Identification System (AIS) network makes it possible to collect a large volume of maritime traffic data and investigate the collision avoidance behavior of real-world ships. Most collision avoidance systems are based on expert systems and simulations based on the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGs). Those regulations outline the general principles underlying collision avoidance; however, they do not provide specific guidance and fail to account for the complexity of many real-world situations. Furthermore, guidance systems coordinating the movement of a ship must have the capacity to predict the movement behavior of all ships involved in potential encounter situations, and do so as early as possible for anti-collision reaction. Our objective in this study was to model the collision avoidance behaviors of human operators in order to formulate a set of realistic trajectory predictions for encountering near collision scenarios. By machine learning approach, the proposed framework is able to learn a model of interaction movement behavior from collected AIS historical traffic data involving near collision situations and then generate a set of predicted trajectories while ships encountering. The proposed model eliminates the need for a priori information related to environmental conditions and the rules governing encounter situations. The resulting projections can be used to suggest anti-collision paths for navigators or to guide the selection of collision-free paths for maritime autonomous surface ships.","maritime traffic monitoring,collision-free paths,Regulation,maritime traffic data,Automatic Identification System network,collision avoidance systems,maritime autonomous surface ships,Marine vehicles,Machine learning,control engineering computing,Predictive models,AIS network,ships,marine safety,global maritime shipping,anti-collision paths,International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea,machine learning,Sea surface,expert systems,marine engineering computing,interaction movement behavior,encounter situation,Trajectory,collision avoidance behavior,trajectory prediction,AIS historical traffic data collection,ship collision accidents,Navigation,navigation,COLREG,collision avoidance,marine control,learning (artificial intelligence),maritime collision avoidance behavior prediction,"

"demurrage pattern analysis using logical analysis of data: a case study of the ulsan port authority","2022","Maritime logistics, which accounts for around 80% of international trade around the world, has been a driving force for economic growth. Increases in maritime traffic, however, lead to increased congestion in berths and terminals. This congestion in turn negatively affects the total ship turnaround time and leads to decreased efficiency in port operations and a higher demurrage rate, which refers to the number of vessels in queue for more than a fixed time period waiting to load/unload out of the total number of vessels entering a port. The demurrage rate directly affects a port’s operating profits; thus, this rate needs to stay as low as possible. In this study, we focus on developing a methodology to address the demurrage rate of a port. To this end, we first collect two sets of vessel data (2016 annual data for training and 2019 annual data for validating) for ships entering and leaving the Port of Ulsan in the Republic of Korea and integrate these datasets with berth data and weather data. We tailor the logical analysis of data (LAD) technique to derive the patterns from the training data that mitigate or aggravate the demurrage rate. We use these patterns to predict the demurrage rate for the validating set of data. The overall binary classification results demonstrate the proposed LAD technique’s competitive performance, compared with other state-of-the-art machine learning methods. We then analyze the patterns to derive policy suggestions that can lower the demurrage rate at the Port of Ulsan. Our computational experiments find that the availability of tugs or pilots and port arrival times mainly affect the demurrage rate at the Port of Ulsan. Finally, our study showcases new possibilities for using patterns of demurrage and non-demurrage vessels obtained by LAD to help policymakers and port operators address the growing demurrage problem.","Maritime logistics,Maritime traffic data,Logical analysis of data,Port congestion,Demurrage rate,"
"ship performance monitoring using machine-learning","2022","The hydrodynamic performance of a sea-going ship varies over its lifespan due to factors like marine fouling and the condition of the anti-fouling paint system. In order to accurately estimate the power demand and fuel consumption for a planned voyage, it is important to assess the hydrodynamic performance of the ship. The current work uses machine-learning (ML) methods to estimate the hydrodynamic performance of a ship using the onboard recorded in-service data. Three ML methods, NL-PCR, NL-PLSR and probabilistic ANN, are calibrated using the data from two sister ships. The calibrated models are used to extract the varying trend in ship’s hydrodynamic performance over time and predict the change in performance through several propeller and hull cleaning events. The predicted change in performance is compared with the corresponding values estimated using the fouling friction coefficient (ΔCF). The ML methods are found to be performing well while modeling the hydrodynamic state of the ships with probabilistic ANN model performing the best, but the results from NL-PCR and NL-PLSR are not far behind, indicating that it may be possible to use simple methods to solve such problems with the help of domain knowledge.","NL-PCR,Probabilistic ANN,Ship performance monitoring,Marine fouling,NL-PLSR,Machine learning,"

"enabling maritime risk assessment using natural language processing-based deep learning techniques","2020","Maritime vessels around the world risk encountering dangerous situations during their voyages such as piracy, kidnappings, hijackings, and smugglings. Such dangers may put crews at risk and potentially cause extensive damage to both the vessel and its cargo. Maritime risk assessment is a process of analyzing such factors to positively impact the safety and timeliness of operations. Analyzing the high-risk areas in seas and oceans can help vessels route around areas with previously recorded high levels of dangerous activities. This information is scraped and extracted from various maritime documents, including newspaper articles, social media, incident blogs, and operational reports. After textual data sources are parsed, it is possible to use this extracted information as training datasets into a Machine Learning (ML) model using Natural Language Processing (NLP) Deep Learning (DL) techniques. With these methods, we can perform document classification, risk extraction, text summarization, topic modeling, and information extraction in an automated manner. Methods that are used include the bag-of words (BOW) approach and, in particular, the use of Named Entity Recognition (NER) to identify specific areas around the world that are considered a risk to a particular voyage. Once this information is processed, the model can determine and aggregate specific areas of high-risk activity. We propose a Maritime Event Log (MEL) pipeline using DL methods. This pipeline includes binary document classification (DC) to extract positive instances of incidents, an incident type classification (IC,) and an information extraction module (IE) including date and location and ship type extraction.

"proactive collision avoidance for autonomous ships: leveraging machine learning to emulate situation awareness","2021","Autonomous ship technology is developing at a rapid pace, with the aim of facilitating safe ship operations. Collision avoidance is one of the most critical tasks that autonomous ships must handle. To support the level of safety associated with collision avoidance, this study suggests to provide autonomous ships with the ability to conduct proactive collision avoidance maneuvers. Proactive collision avoidance entails predicting future encounter situations, such that they can preemptively be avoided. However, any such actions must adhere to relevant navigation rules and regulations. As such, it is suggested to predict encounter situations far in advance, i.e. prior to risk of collision existing. Any actions can, therefore, be conducted prior to the applicability of the COLREGs. As such, simple corrective measures, e.g. minor speed and/or heading alterations, can prevent close encounter situations from arising, reducing the overall risk associated with autonomous ship operations, as well as improving traffic flow. This study suggests to facilitate this ability by emulating the development of situation awareness in ship navigators through machine learning. By leveraging historical AIS data to serve as artificial navigational experience, long-range trajectory predictions can be facilitated in a similar manner those conducted by human navigators, where such predictions provide the basis for proactive collision avoidance actions. The development of human situation awareness is, therefore, presented, and relevant machine learning techniques are discussed to emulate the same mechanisms.","Situation Awareness,Machine Learning,Collision Avoidance,Autonomous Ships,"

"keynote: multi-domain situational awareness - from the underwater to the space domain to improve maritime surveillance","2022","Modern surveillance systems require to integrate coherently all available sources of information to compose an operational picture that is as complete as possible. While in the past surveillance had suffered from a lack of data, current technology transformed the problem into one of an overabundance of information, leading to an extreme need for automated analysis. Indeed, current surveillance sensors generate volumes of data that would have been unthinkable only a few years ago. Therefore, all the processing, algorithm calibration, parameter tuning, etc., need to be executed as much automatically as possible. This also requires novel paradigms for algorithmic design. In this respect, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Data Fusion (DF) offer an unprecedented opportunity to strengthen the technological edge; however, the risk is to elevate, at the same time, the speed of the threats we face. Indeed, the surveillance task is complicated by the diversification of threats, whose nature and origin is most often unknown.

"machine learning for shaft power prediction and analysis of fouling related performance deterioration","2021","Improving operational performance and reducing fuel consumption is increasingly important for shipping companies. Ship performance degrades over time due to hull and propeller fouling; therefore assessing when fouling effects are significant enough to warrant cleaning is critical. Advancements in onboard data logging systems, combined with machine learning techniques, unlock the potential to predict fouling effects accurately and determine when to clean. This study evaluates five models for shaft power prediction: Multiple Linear Regression, Decision Tree (AdaBoost), K – Nearest Neighbours, Artificial Neural Network and Random Forest. The importance of pre-processing is highlighted, contributing to the creation of a model with lower errors than previous studies. The significance of environmental parameters was explored, with the novel integration of wave statistics to the operational dataset, and simulated power-speed curves created from predictions to identify performance deterioration due to fouling. The Random Forest model was most effective in predicting shaft power, with an error of 1.17%.

In the development of GeMASS, a machine learning approach was applied to discover knowledge that is applicable in characterizing maritime security threats. Such knowledge is often implicit in datasets and difficult to discover by human analysts. As the knowledge relevant to maritime security may vary from time to time, GeMASS was specified to learn from streaming data and to generate up-to-date knowledge in a dynamic fashion. Based on the knowledge discovered, the system functions to screen vessels for anomalies in real-time. Traditionally in maritime security studies, datasets that are applied as knowledge sources are related to vessels’ geographical and movement information.

"sarfish: space-based maritime surveillance using complex synthetic aperture radar imagery","2022","Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery is an essential part of maritime surveillance since it can operate in most weather conditions, day and night. Space-borne SAR especially can provide a large surveillance coverage in which both ground-range detected (GRD) imagery at a reduced resolution and single-look complex (SLC) imagery at a finer resolution of the same observation scene are available. Recently, a large, fully labeled, Sentinel-1 GRD based dataset, named xView3-SAR, was released to promote machine learning (ML) research in detection and classification of ships in order to assist with monitoring illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing activities. In this paper, the xView3-SAR's companion SLC dataset, called the SARFish, is introduced. The aim is to promote the use of SLC data for improving IUU fishing ship detection and classification. An ML-based algorithm using the combined GRD-SLC SAR data is presented as a base-line model for demonstration. The algorithm consists of a constant false-alarm rate (CFAR) detector whose false-alarm rate is reduced by a cascade of classifiers trained using the GRD data, followed by a ship classifier trained using the SLC data. Preliminary results suggest that despite not using multi-looks to reduce sea-clutter spikes, the use of SLC images does not degrade ship detection. Furthermore, a very modest improvement in ship classification is observed.11Under contract from Rheinmetall Defence Australia Pty Ltd, Adelaide, SA, Australia.","radio frequencies,classification,space-based maritime Surveillance,Marine vehicles,Machine learning,maritime vessels,maritime objects,Synthetic aperture radar,geophysical image processing,Meteorology,complex Synthetic Aperture Radar imagery,MS,visible frequencies,electro-optic imaging,single-look complex (SLC),synthetic aperture radar,Classification algorithms,radar imaging,Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR),Radar polarimetry,SARFish,sufficient spatial resolution,Australia,radar imaging category,Image resolution,ground-range detected (GRD),constant false-alarm rate (CFAR) detection,space-borne SAR imagery,Surveillance,imaging modalities,Spaceborne radar,remote sensing by radar,image coverage,machine learning (ML),image scene,"
"machine learning in sustainable ship design and operation: a review","2022","The shipping industry faces a large challenge as it needs to significantly lower the amounts of Green House Gas emissions. Traditionally, reducing the fuel consumption for ships has been achieved during the design stage and, after building a ship, through optimisation of ship operations. In recent years, ship efficiency improvements using Machine Learning (ML) methods are quickly progressing, facilitated by available data from remote sensing, experiments and high-fidelity simulations. The data have been successfully applied to extract intricate empirical rules that can reduce emissions thereby helping achieve green shipping. This article presents an overview of applying ML techniques to enhance ships’ sustainability. The work covers the ML fundamentals and applications in relevant areas: ship design, operational performance, and voyage planning. Suitable ML approaches are analysed and compared on a scenario basis, with their space for improvements also discussed. Meanwhile, a reminder is given that ML has many inherent uncertainties and hence should be used with caution.","Computer-aided engineering,Sustainability,Operation,Machine learning,Ship,Design,"
"overview of the security architecture of the comprehensive maritime awareness system","2009","The Comprehensive Maritime Awareness (CMA) system tries to identify anomalous behavior and potential threats associated with the global maritime domain that could impact the United States and coalition partners' security. It analyzes data from multiple sources that impose different data handling requirements, to discover potential threats. Security architecture and mechanisms are essential enablers for data sharing. More data stewards will share their data when they feel secure with the data protection mechanism of the system that will host their data. Critical technologies for data protection and access mediation for CMA are Oracle label security (OLS) and attribute-based access control (ABAC) based on federated identity management. Federated identity providers use security assertion markup language (SAML) 2.0 as a protocol to exchange user identity and attributes. This paper provides a high-level overview of the CMA security architecture.

"a data mining method to extract traffic network for maritime transport management","2023","Maritime traffic network is essential for navigation efficiency and safety of the maritime transport system. This study proposes a framework for extracting maritime traffic network based on Automatic Identification System (AIS) data. The framework consists of maritime traffic pattern recognition, semantic routes extraction, route decomposition, and network generation. Firstly, a data-driven method is introduced to recognize ship behavior patterns and extends the single ship behaviors to regional characteristics to determine the departure-arrival areas. Then, based on the different combination of departure-arrival areas, the ship trajectories are classified to traffic groups. Subsequently, the grid-system is used to rasterize each traffic group, which realizes the fusion of trajectory data and geographic location information. Finally, to obtain the main routes and navigation channels, the extraction method is introduced by establishing the cumulative grid importance function. The main routes, together with the navigation channels, compose the maritime traffic network. The method is applied to AIS data in the Beibu Gulf, and the results show that the traffic network contains 12 stop areas, 4 entry/exit locations, 13 main routes as well as their corresponding navigation channels. It is therefore concluded that the proposed method helps (1) provide a theoretical framework to obtain and analyze the maritime traffic network and (2) enrich navigation channel identification methods for maritime transport management.","Maritime traffic network,Maritime transport management,AIS,Machine learning,Big data analytics,"
"weather-aware object detection method for maritime surveillance systems","2023","The development of machine learning-based maritime object detection technology aims to assist ship operators in maritime surveillance. However, as maritime environments can be quite complex, developing object detection models that can handle these situations is a challenging research problem, particularly when dealing with adverse weather conditions like rain and haze. While prior research has attempted to remove weather noise and improve object detection models under various weather conditions, they are limited by computing resources and hard to adapt to the constantly changing weather conditions of maritime environments. Preventing performance degradation as weather conditions shift is a significant challenge in maritime surveillance systems. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a weather-aware object detection method, Weather-OD, that employs an on-board edge and on-shore cloud-based system for maritime surveillance. It employs specialized machine learning models for object detection, which can be dynamically selected based on the weather conditions to ensure highly accurate object detection with low latency at sea. Weather-OD continuously improves accuracy by periodically training the models with newly collected datasets during voyages, and efficiently manages the life cycle of multiple object detection models, taking into account the constraints of limited edge computing resources. In addition, Weather-OD uses synthetic image data with weather noise to supplement the training data under different weather conditions. We conducted an evaluation of our weather-aware object detection models using a maritime benchmark dataset, the Singapore Maritime Dataset. Our experimental results demonstrated the feasibility of our mechanism with weather classification and a significant improvement in the mean Average Precision (mAP) of maritime object detection in rainy and hazy conditions. Additionally, our approach enables the continuous improvement of object detection accuracy through model retraining with small datasets.","Edge cloud,Maritime surveillance,Weather-aware,Object detection,Adaptation,Model specialization,"

"comparison of detectability of ship wake components between c-band and x-band synthetic aperture radar sensors operating under different slant ranges","2023","The detectability of wake components is affected by influencing parameters, which can be categorized into ship properties, environmental conditions and image acquisition settings. The characteristics of influences of most influencing parameters on the detectability are established. However, a consequent investigation and systematization of influences regarding differences in settings of various SARs have not been published. In this study, data from four different SARs missions, namely TerraSAR–X (TSX), CosmoSkymed (CSK), Sentinel–1 (S1) and RADARSAT–2 (RS2), were collected and analyzed with focus on detectability of ship wake components. The sensors operate on different orbit altitudes and radar frequency bands: TSX and CSK work with X–Band, S1 and RS2 work with C–Band. Using methods from the field of Data Science, the detectability of wake components is modelled for each of the four sensors using machine leaning by the support vector machine (SVM) method. The created SVM-models are then compared in order to derive statements regarding relative detectability of individual wake components. A measure of detectability model’s uncertainty and an alternative analysis based on accumulated backscattering statistics is presented to support the derived statements. In conclusion, sensors with shorter slant ranges and X–Band in comparison to C–Band were found to be better suited for the detection of ship wakes. However, these characteristics only hold for wake components detectable due to the Bragg scattering mechanism, i.e. Kelvin wake arms and V-narrow wakes. No significant difference for near and far field of turbulent wakes is recognized.","Ship wake detection,Synthetic aperture radar,Maritime object detection,Detectability modelling,Machine learning,"
"real-time infrared horizon detection in maritime and land environments based on hyper-laplace filter and convolutional neural network","2023","The infrared (IR) horizon is an essential reference for near-ground state awareness and target detection. The traditional horizon detection algorithms based on hand-crafted features claim the advantage of being intuitive and highly targeted, however, their capability of detail extraction and robustness is not strong enough when switching among diverse scenes, meanwhile, the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have the powerful ability in feature acquisition, but has the disadvantages of interpretability and instability. Given this, this article proposes a novel horizon detection algorithm that combines the traditional method and CNN. First, the hyper-Laplace filter (HLF) is proposed to eliminate the interferences and enhance the saliency of the target. Then a positioning module (PM) based on the traditional idea which fully utilizes the structural characteristics of multifeature-maps in CNN is present to extract the endpoints of the horizon. Finally, an auxiliary module that consists of a revise branch (RB) and self-attention module (SAM) is designed to assist the PM with detailed corrections. Compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms, experiments based on three datasets with more than 25000 frames under various scenes demonstrate that the proposed algorithm not only achieves the best accuracy and highest stability but also addresses real-time needs. Notably, the detection deviation is controlled within 2 pixels on all three datasets while achieving a comparable detection speed of 170 frames/s. Besides, our algorithm also shows strong robustness even under harsh sea conditions and urban backgrounds.

"predicting the risky encounters without distance knowledge between the ships via machine learning algorithms","2023","As the maritime traffic is getting denser, the number of encounters is increasing. The aim of this study is to develop a prediction model to classify encounters as risky or non-risky when two ships encounter in a certain buffer zone. A novel methodology is proposed to integrate three-dimensional clustering in the algorithm training process. K-means clustering, and ensemble machine learning algorithms-based prediction framework is developed to overcome class imbalance. The methodology is tested in the Strait of Istanbul (SOI) and parameters are generated from a long-term AIS dataset. Framework is validated via cross validation techniques. Precision, Recall, Accuracy and ROC-AUC Score are used as measures to evaluate models. Benchmark models are generated, and the most advanced model successfully predicts each 4 out of 5 risky encounters without the knowledge of distance between two ships. Eliminating distance from decision factors provides an action period before risky encounters. Therefore, proposed framework can be a guide for autonomous vessels for safe navigation and maritime authorities to improve maritime safety.","Strait of Istanbul,Machine Learning,Risky Encounter,Autonomous Vessels,Maritime Risk,Clustering,"
"privacy protection technology of maritime multi-agent communication based on part-federated learning","2021","Federated learning is a machine learning model based on distributed data sets, which builds a global model under the premise of ensuring the privacy and data security of participants. Because of this characteristic, federated learning is very suitable for maritime communication systems with large amounts of distributed data. However, the data set of maritime multi-agent communication system is different from the general data set, and the data distribution is not uniform, which increases the deviation of the model. In this paper, we propose a Part-Federated Learning (PFL) method which combines the advantages of split learning to improve the classical federated learning. This method, only uploading some parameters in the local model to the cloud server as shared parameters, reduces the communication cost of distributed learning, improves the privacy of the algorithm to the data, and has better performance in processing non-IDD distributed data. We optimize the proportion of shared parameters of PFL by considering the convergence of the algorithm and the communication cost. Finally, we verify the advantages of the algorithm in processing non-IID data through experiments, simulate the process of parameter optimization, and prove the feasibility of the algorithm.","shared parameters,parameter optimization,Maritime multi-agent,Data privacy,Collaborative work,privacy protection technology,Costs,security of data,distributed learning,distributed data sets,Distributed databases,data distribution,Servers,marine engineering,cloud computing,machine learning,maritime multiagent communication system,Data models,part-federated learning,split learning,nonIDD distributed data,Mobile Systems,Part-Federated Learning,Distance learning,communication cost reduction,data security,marine communication,PFL,cloud server,Global Imbalanced Data,learning (artificial intelligence),multi-agent systems,data privacy,global model,"
"detection of invalid ais messages using machine learning techniques","2022","Coastal nations monitor maritime activities in the interest of defence, security, and safety. This form of monitoring typically occurs at operations centers that visualize the maritime environment by creating a Recognized Maritime Picture (RMP) covering a particular area of interest. The creation of this picture changed drastically with the introduction of the Automatic Identification System (AIS). AIS messages are known to contain numerous types of errors and in April 2020 a unique error was found in the data stream. This error consisted of messages indicating the appearance of over 200 vessels in the North Atlantic taking part in a yacht race when in fact no race or physical ships existed. The following work explores the application of various machine learning (ML) techniques to help identify these types of fabricated AIS messages. Specific ML techniques were explored including: K-means clustering, Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Feed-Forward Neural Networks (FNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and One-Class Support Vector Machines (One-SVM). The results showed that DT, RF, and FNN best identified the fabricated AIS messages with F1 scores greater than 93 percent on the test data.","maritime domain awareness,AIS,automatic identification system,machine learning,"
"adaptive detection tracking system for autonomous uav maritime patrolling","2020","Nowadays, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are considered reliable systems, suitable for several autonomous applications, especially for target detection and tracking. Although significant developments were achieved in object detection systems over the last decades using the deep learning technique known as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), there are still research gaps in this area. In this paper, we present a new object detection-tracking algorithm that can be used on low power consuming processing boards. In particular, we analysed a specific application scenario in which a UAV patrols coastlines and autonomously classifies different kind of marine objects. Current state of the art solutions propose centralised architectures or flying systems with human in the loop, making the whole system poorly efficient and not scalable. On the contrary, applying a Deep Learning detection system that runs on commercial Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) makes UAVs potentially more efficient than humans (especially for dull tasks like coastline patrolling) and the whole system becomes easily scalable because each UAV can fly independently and the Ground Control Station does not represent a bottleneck. To deal with this task, a database consisting of more than 115000 images was created to train and test several CNN architectures. Furthermore, an adaptive detection-tracking algorithm was introduced to make the whole system faster by optimizing the balancing between detecting new objects and tracking existing targets. The proposed solution is based on the measure of the tracking confidence and the frame similarity, by means of the Structural SIMilarity (SSIM) index, computed both globally and locally. Finally, the developed algorithms were tested on a realistic scenario by means of a UAV test-bed.","unmanned aerial vehicles,coastline patrolling,target detection,robot vision,adaptive detection tracking,Machine learning,Feature extraction,target tracking,service robots,object detection tracking,CNN,deep learning detection system,graphics processing units,Target tracking,object detection,pinhole camera model,image classification,autonomous UAV maritime patrolling,neural net architecture,convolutional neural nets,autonomous aerial vehicles,convolutional neural networks,Training,Convolutional neural networks,Unmanned aerial vehicles,CNN architectures,Detection-Tracking System,structural similarity index,autonomous classification,learning (artificial intelligence),Detectors,UAV,"

"red tide detection based on high spatial resolution broad band optical satellite data","2022","Red tide, one of the major ecological disasters in the world, exerts great impact on the marine environment. The ocean color satellite data with low spatial resolution and high spectral resolution is often used for red tide detection, but is insufficient for the fine-scale red tide detection due to its coarse spatial resolution. To address this problem, a new red tide detection method based on pseudo hue angle (PHA-RI) for high spatial resolution broad band satellite data is proposed in this paper. Different from the standard International Commission on Illumination (CIE) system, the false-color bands of near infrared (NIR), red and green are used to calculate the CIE tristimulus X, Y, Z, instead of the true-color bands of red, green and blue. With this method, the red tide can be easily differentiated from non-red tide water, and the distinction between red tide and non-red tide water is doubled compared to that of true-color bands composite. Experiment results show that the PHA-RI method can effectively detect red tide, with an averaged overall accuracy, F1-score and precision of 92%, 0.92 and 0.92 respectively. Compared with the traditional machine learning method support vector machine (SVM) and spectral index algorithm Gaofen-1 (GF-1) red tide detection index (GF-RI), the proposed algorithm has obvious advantages in red tide detection, especially for the strip distributed red tide. Besides, the proposed algorithm has good applicability, and it is proved to be suitable for the detection of red tides with different dominant species including Noctiluca scintillans, Skeletonema costatum and Heterosigma akashiide. Also, it is applicable to different broad band sensors, such as Chinese satellites GF-1 Wide Field of View (WFV), Haiyang 1D (HY-1D) Coastal Zone Imager (CZI), Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI). The application experiment indicates that the proposed algorithm is effective in red tide detection, and it can successfully detect fine-scale red tide events, which have not been detected by Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Aqua due to its coarse spatial resolution. The results also shows the advantages of high spatial resolution satellites in fine-scale red tide detection.

"a big data analytics method for the evaluation of ship - ship collision risk reflecting hydrometeorological conditions","2021","This paper presents a big data analytics method for the evaluation of ship-ship collision risk in real operational conditions. The approach makes use of big data from Automatic Identification System (AIS) and nowcast data corresponding to time-dependent traffic situations and hydro-meteorological conditions respectively. An Avoidance Behavior-based Collision Detection Model (ABCD-M) is introduced to identify potential collision scenarios and Collision Risk Indices (CRIs) are quantified when evasive actions are taken for each detected collision scenario in various voyages. The method is applied on Ro-Pax ships operating over 13 months of the ice-free period in the Gulf of Finland. Results indicate that collision risk estimates may be extremely diverse among voyages, and in 97.5% of potential collision scenarios the evasive actions are triggered only when risk is at 45% or more of its maximum value. The overall CRI for ships operating over the given area tends to be lower for adverse hydro-meteorological conditions. It is therefore concluded that the proposed method may assist with the (1) identification of critical scenarios in various voyages not currently accounted for by existing accident databases, (2) definition of commonly agreed risk criteria to set off alarms, (3) the estimation of risk profile over the life cycle of fleet operations.","Gulf of Finland,Maritime operations,Ship safety,Machine learning,Collisions,Big data analytics,"
"demand and supply-side determinants of electric power consumption and representative roadmaps to 100% renewable systems","2021","The need to transform electric power systems to a cleaner electricity mix to help save the climate is undisputable but existing transition pathways have become unreliable due to inadequate representation of both demand and supply-side determinants of electric power supply, as well as failure to inculcate volatility in electric power systems in the core transition modelling. This study inculcates demand and supply-side determinants to investigate the long- and short-run causal relationships between the electric power system, macroeconomic performance, demography, environmental quality, and capital formation, for Sweden. We also propose and implement econometric and two-stage attention-based machine learning models for volatility-consistent electric power forecasting. Using annual data spanning 1990–2018, the results suggest a long-run relationship exists between electricity generation and the independent variables. Empirical results for the volatility-consistent attention-based machine learning model predict that Sweden’s electric power demand in 2050 could reach ∼112 TWh if conservation practices are implemented, and ∼146 TWh if otherwise. If conservation practices are implemented, evidence from selected volatility-consistent simulations show that Sweden can provide 100% of all her electricity demand from cleaner sources by 2030. The findings depict that Sweden must implement stringent and radical policies to achieve its mid-century green electricity targets.","Demand and supply-side determinants,100% renewable Electricity consumption,Two-stage attention-based recurrent neural network,Volatility-consistent cleaner electricity transition pathways,Causality,Climate change,"

The highlights of the campaigns include improved prediction of equatorial spread-F (ESF) based on a ‘new factor’ combining the strength and asymmetry of the equatorial ionization anomaly (EIA); simultaneous detection of quasi-2-day wave at both E and F region heights; tomographic image showing a Traveling Ionospheric Disturbance (TID) in association with a counter electrojet (CEJ) event—all highlighting the neutral and electrodynamical coupling of the equatorial ionosphere−thermosphere regions; an unusual lowering of mesospheric temperature during a moderate geomagnetic storm—highlighting a new space weather effect; diurnal tide showing a peak amplitude of 35m/s at 45km in zonal wind and a significantly lower amplitude (∼15m/s) in the meridional wind and also evidence of convective activity in the lower atmosphere influencing the tidal variability in the Mesosphere−Lower Thermosphere (MLT) region highlighting the vertical coupling of the atmospheric regions. The development of models for equatorial and low latitude ionosphere has been among the prime activities taken up under ‘Space Climate’. Two models have been developed towards this end: one based on Second Degree (SD) relationships of F region parameters to the mean sun spot number and the other a Multiple Regression Analysis (MRA) based model involving expressions relating F region parameters to that representing solar and geomagnetic activities. The two models, intended for long and short term predictions, have been found to represent the equatorial and low latitude ionosphere over Indian longitudes better than the commonly used International Reference Ionosphere (IRI). Under the theme of ‘Solar Influence on Atmospheric Climate’, a study has been made on the effects of solar variability on middle atmosphere using satellite data and model simulations, highlighting the significant differences between them.","Ionosphere,Magnetosphere,CAWSES,Stratosphere–troposphere,Solarwind,Mesosphere,Thermosphere,"
"ontologies for probabilistic situation assessment in the maritime domain","2013","In the maritime domain, surveillance systems are used to track vessels in a certain area of interest. The resulting vessel tracks are then displayed in a dynamic map. However, the interpretation of the dynamic environment, i.e., the situation assessment (SA) process, is still done by human experts. Several methods exist that can be used for automatic SA, but often they are based on machine learning algorithms and do not include the knowledge of the decision maker. In this article, we describe how expert knowledge can be used to determine models for automatic SA. The knowledge about situations of interest is modeled as an ontology, which can be transformed into a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN). The main challenge of this transformation is the determination of the structure and the parameter settings of the DBN. The resulting DBN can be connected to real-time vessel tracks and is able to estimate the existence of the situation of interest in every time step.","dynamic map,Hidden Markov models,machine learning algorithm,probabilistic situation assessment,dynamic environment,belief networks,Conferences,track vessel,marine engineering,Training data,Probabilistic logic,maritime domain,dynamic Bayesian network,Radar tracking,ontologies (artificial intelligence),situation assessment process,surveillance system,Ontologies,Surveillance,ontologies,learning (artificial intelligence),real time vessel tracks,"
"a cnn-lstm network for augmenting target detection in real maritime wide area surveillance radar data","2020","Typical radar detectors exploit only a small proportion of the valuable information contained in radar reflections, i.e. magnitude and Doppler. A neural network-based approach for augmenting traditional radar detector structures using machine learning (ML) is proposed in this paper. Specifically, the network is designed to augment target detection in the field of maritime wide area surveillance for non-coherent data. A combination network consisting of a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract spatial features and a long short-term memory (LSTM) for extracting temporal patterns in the spatial features is proposed. The network augments the detector structure by blanking out regions of the frame which are classified as not containing a target, thus reducing false alarms. The network is tested on data containing four marine targets collected by a ground-based radar. The data set was chosen because it contains strong sea clutter returns. When ML is used, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves are shifted to lower probability of false alarm (PFA). A Kalman filter tracker was applied to the ML-augmented and baseline detections, and it was shown that ML-augmented detections produced similar tracks at lower PFA. The feature discovering capability of the network is analyzed through a series of tests, and the argument is made that the CNN-LSTM network presented in this work demonstrates the ability to improve the detection performance by exploiting spatial and temporal information in the data.","real maritime wide area surveillance radar data,detector structure,Kalman filters,marine radar,baseline detections,radar detection,radar clutter,CNN-LSTM network,Feature extraction,ML-augmented detections,LSTM,target detection augmentation,neural nets,target tracking,short-term memory,wide area surveillance radar,Artificial neural networks,CNN,noncoherent data,maritime surveillance,object detection,feature extraction,combination network,search radar,data set,radar imaging,convolutional neural network,detection performance,ground-based radar,neural network-based approach,radar detectors,radar tracking,radar reflections,temporal information,marine targets,probability,Clutter,Object detection,false alarm,traditional radar detector structures,learning (artificial intelligence),spatial features,Detectors,Radar detection,spatial information,"
"ship behavior prediction via trajectory extraction-based clustering for maritime situation awareness","2022","This study presents a method in which historical AIS data are used to predict the future trajectory of a selected vessel. This is facilitated via a system intelligence-based approach that can be subsequently utilized to provide enhanced situation awareness to navigators and future autonomous ships, aiding proactive collision avoidance. By evaluating the historical ship behavior in a given geographical region, the method applies machine learning techniques to extrapolate commonalities in relevant trajectory segments. These commonalities represent historical behavior modes that correspond to the possible future behavior of the selected vessel. Subsequently, the selected vessel is classified to a behavior mode, and a trajectory with respect to this mode is predicted. This is achieved via an initial clustering technique and subsequent trajectory extraction. The extracted trajectories are then compressed using the Karhunen–Loéve transform, and clustered using a Gaussian Mixture Model. The approach in this study differs from others in that trajectories are not clustered for an entire region, but rather for relevant trajectory segments. As such, the extracted trajectories provide a much better basis for clustering relevant historical ship behavior modes. A selected vessel is then classified to one of these modes using its observed behavior. Trajectory predictions are facilitated using an enhanced subset of data that likely correspond to the future behavior of the selected vessel. The method yields promising results, with high classification accuracy and low prediction error. However, vessels with abnormal behavior degrade the results in some situations, and have also been discussed in this study.","Collision avoidance,Unsupervised learning,Trajectory prediction,AIS,Machine learning,Ship navigation,Maritime situation awareness,"
"a novelty detection approach to diagnosing hull and propeller fouling","2019","Hull and propeller performance have a primary role in overall vessel efficiency. Vessel fouling is a common phenomenon where undesirable substances attach or grow on the ship hull. A clear understanding of the extent of the degradation of the hull will allow better management of assets and prediction of the best time for dry docking and hull maintenance work. In this paper, the authors investigate the problems of predicting the hull condition in real operations based on data measured by the on-board systems. The proposed solution uses an unsupervised Machine Learning (ML) modelling technique to eliminate the need for collecting labeled data related to the hull and propeller fouling condition. Two anomaly detection methods based on Support Vector Machines and k-nearest neighbour have been applied to predict the hull condition using the available parameters measured on-board. Data from the Research Vessel The Princess Royal has been exploited to show the effectiveness of the proposed methods and to benchmark them in a realistic maritime application.","Data analytics,Hull and propeller performance,Sensor data collection,Supervised learning,Hull fouling detection,Ship efficiency,"

"improving maritime traffic emission estimations on missing data with crbms","2020","Maritime traffic emissions are a major concern to governments as they heavily impact the Air Quality in coastal cities. Ships use the Automatic Identification System (AIS) to continuously report position and speed among other features, and therefore this data is suitable to be used to estimate emissions, if it is combined with engine data. However, important ship features are often inaccurate or missing. State-of-the-art complex systems, like CALIOPE at the Barcelona Supercomputing Center, are used to model Air Quality. These systems can benefit from AIS based emission models as they are very precise in positioning the pollution. Unfortunately, these models are sensitive to missing or corrupted data, and therefore they need data curation techniques to significantly improve the estimation accuracy. In this work, we propose a methodology for treating ship data using Conditional Restricted Boltzmann Machines (CRBMs) plus machine learning methods to improve the quality of data passed to emission models that can also be applied to other GPS and time-series problems. Results show that we can improve the default methods proposed to cover missing data. In our results, we observed that using our method the models boosted their accuracy to detect otherwise undetectable emissions. In particular, we used a real data-set of AIS data, provided by the Spanish Port Authority, to estimate that thanks to our method, the model was able to detect 45% of additional emissions, representing 152 tonnes of pollutants per week in Barcelona and propose new features that may enhance emission modeling.","CRBM,Data cleaning,Emission modeling,AIS,GPS,Ship time series,"

"integrated machine learning and probabilistic degradation approach for vessel electric motor prognostics","2023","In the transition towards more sustainable ships, electric motors (EM) are being used in ship propulsion systems to reduce emissions and increase efficiency. The safe operation of ships is crucial, and prognostics and health management applications have emerged as effective solutions to transit towards monitored reliable systems. In this context, this paper presents a probabilistic EM prognostics model integrating data-driven operational models and physics-informed degradation models. Firstly, motor torque and winding temperature are estimated through connected machine learning models, which are based on operational and meteorological data. Operational and meteorological variables drive the EM degradation model and enable the analysis of EM degradation under different operational and environmental conditions. Subsequently, EM remaining useful life (RUL) is predicted within a probabilistic Monte-Carlo approach combining the thermal-stress model along with the associated uncertainties. The methodology is tested on a real case study of the OV Ryvingen vessel, with collected data during voyages along the Norwegian coast. Results confirm the validity of the designed RUL model showing that, under normal operation conditions, the degradation is mild, and the temperature measurement errors are important for RUL estimation.","Degradation,Uncertainty,Insulation,Prognostics,Machine learning,Electric motor,"
"textual risk mining for maritime situational awareness","2014","In this paper, we propose an auxiliary Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) integrated system for maritime situational awareness (MSA) operations. We bring into account a new and influential asset - human intuition and perception - to the existing semi-automated decision support systems that mostly rely on numerical data collected by electronic sensors or cameras located either directly on the vessels or in the maritime command-and-control centers. For our project, we gathered weekly textual reports spanning twelve months from the United States Worldwide Threats to Shipping Reports repository that belongs to the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), We considered the maritime incident reports written by human operators as a valuable and accessible unstructured textual input source in which a span of text1 is called â€œriskâ€ if it expresses one of the following kinds of vessel incidents: fired, robbed, boarded, hijacked, attacked, chased, approached, kidnapped, boarding attempted, suspiciously approached or clashed with. Our approach benefits from probability distributions of some useful features annotated based on a list of lexicons that contain expressions denoting vessel types, risks types, risk associates, maritime geographical locations, dates and times. These distributions are captured and used to anchor the span of â€œrisksâ€ as they are described in the textual reports. After some preprocessing steps that include tokenization, named entity extraction and part-of-speech tagging, the textual risk mining system applies a variety of sequence classification algorithms, e.g., Conditional Random Fields, Conditional Markov Models and Hidden Markov Models in order to compare the risk classification performance. Empirical results show that our NLP/ML-based system can extract variable-length risk spans from the textual reports with about 90% correctness.","Markov processes,decision support systems,hidden Markov models,statistical distributions,tokenization,Risk management,attacked vessel incident,human intuition,Hidden Markov models,maritime geographical locations,conditional Markov models,maritime domain awareness,maritime command-and-control centers,Feature extraction,natural language processing,chased vessel incident,entity extraction,variable-length risk span extraction,maritime incident reports,maritime situational awareness,sequence classification algorithms,conditional random fields,robbed vessel incident,electronic sensors,United States worldwide threats to shipping reports repository,maritime situational awareness operation,fired vessel incident,marine safety,National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency,marine engineering,boarded vessel incident,feature annotation,machine learning,semiautomated decision support systems,cameras,part-of-speech tagging,risk management,NLP/ML-based system,Classification algorithms,probability distributions,risks types,risk classification performance,textual risk mining system,weekly textual reports,auxiliary ML,auxiliary machine learning,hijacked vessel incident,command and control systems,vessels,human perception,vessel types,MSA operation,kidnapped vessel incident,risk associates,risk detection,NGA,text analysis,boarding attempted vessel incident,approached vessel incident,Data mining,learning (artificial intelligence),sequence-based classifiers,"

"a machine learning approach for monitoring ship safety in extreme weather events","2021","Extreme weather events can result in loss of life, environmental pollution and major damage to vessels caught in their path. Many methods to characterise this risk have been proposed, however, they typically utilise deterministic thresholds of wind and wave limits which might not accurately reflect risk. To address this limitation, we investigate the potential of machine learning algorithms to quantify the relative likelihood of an incident during the US Atlantic hurricane season. By training an algorithm on vessel traffic, weather and historical casualty data, accident candidates can be identified from historic vessel tracks. Amongst the various methods tested, Support Vector Machines showed good performance with Recall at 95% and Accuracy reaching 92%. Finally, we implement the developed model using a case study of Hurricane Matthew (October 2016). Our method contributes to enhancements in maritime safety by enabling machine intelligent risk-aware ship routing and monitoring of vessel transits by Coastguard agencies.","Maritime risk assessment,Severe weather events,Machine learning,Navigation safety,"
"predictive maintenance leveraging machine learning for time-series forecasting in the maritime industry","2020","One of the key challenges in the maritime industry refers to minimizing the time a vessel cannot be utilized, which has multiple effects. The latter is addressed through maintenance approaches that however in many cases are not efficient in terms of cost and downtime. Predictive maintenance provides optimized maintenance scheduling offering extended vessel lifespan, coupled with reduced maintenance costs. As in several industries, including the maritime domain, an increasing amount of data is made available through the deployment and exploitation of data sources, such as on board sensors that provide real-time information. These data provide the required ground for analysis and thus support for various types of data-driven decision making. In the maritime domain, sensors are deployed on vessels to monitor their engines and data analysis tools are needed to assist engineers towards reduced operational risk through predictive maintenance solutions that are put in place. In this paper, we present an approach for anomaly detection on time-series data, utilizing machine learning on the vessels sensor data, in order to predict the condition of specific parts of the vessel's main engine and thus facilitate predictive maintenance.

"dbscan algorithm for ais data reconstruction","2021","Automatic Identification System (AIS) is a telecommunication system created to allow ships to communicate with each other by exchanging messages containing information such as vessel’s ID, position, speed, heading, etc. AIS is useful in many cases, such as early ship collision detection. However, its terrestrial segment’s drawback is a relatively low range (about 74 km, roughly 40 nautical miles). Satellite Automatic Identification System (SAT-AIS) was introduced to overcome this limitation, but it suffers from its own problem known as packet collision. The satellite receives messages from multiple terrestrial cells and communication is synchronized within such cells, but not between them, thus messages got lost or damaged when they appear at the satellite at the same time. In this paper, we present a machine learning-based approach to reconstruct those missing messages and deeply investigate whether or not a density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) can be considered in the first stage of the reconstruction. The experiment focuses on findig the optimal parameters for the clustering, running it both on original and damaged data to finally ascertain that DSBCAN can distinguish individual trajectories in a dataset that can be further reconstructed.","clustering,DBSCAN,AIS data analysis,trajectory reconstruction,AIS,"

This paper presents a data-driven approach that uses the historical AIS data within a selected area in the Danish waters. The historical data is transformed into a probabilistic heat map using Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), and is further encoded using a Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE) before entered into the estimation scheme. The estimation scheme consists of a Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) model, in a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) configuration, which is sampled multiple times, yielding a single trajectory prediction with uncertainty.

"eeg-based maritime object detection for iot-driven surveillance systems in smart ocean","2020","Automated maritime object detection is a significant research challenge in intelligent marine surveillance systems for the Internet of Things (IoT) and smart ocean applications. In particular, ship detection is recognized as one of the core research issues of these IoT-driven intelligent marine surveillance systems. Traditional methods based on machine learning have made some achievements in detection tasks for specific objects. However, the ship objects are relatively small, and they are usually not accurately detected. In this article, we propose an electroencephalography (EEG)-based maritime object detection algorithm for IoT-driven surveillance systems in the smart ocean. For this purpose, we conduct experiments to record the EEG signals of subjects when they are watching the maritime image scenes. With the feature analysis of EEG signals, the event-related potential (ERP) components associated with detecting objects are induced, such as the  $P3$  and  $N2$  components. Employing classification based on linear discriminant analysis (LDA), the area under curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) is used to evaluate the detection accuracy. We use this novel method to determine and identify essential objects and areas from IoT devices, such as digital camera imaging sensors.

"a dual linear autoencoder approach for vessel trajectory prediction using historical ais data","2020","Advances in artificial intelligence are driving the development of intelligent transportation systems, with the purpose of enhancing the safety and efficiency of such systems. One of the most important aspects of maritime safety is effective collision avoidance. In this study, a novel dual linear autoencoder approach is suggested to predict the future trajectory of a selected vessel. Such predictions can serve as a decision support tool to evaluate the future risk of ship collisions. Inspired by generative models, the method suggests to predict the future trajectory of a vessel based on historical AIS data. Using unsupervised learning to facilitate trajectory clustering and classification, the method utilizes a cluster of historical AIS trajectories to predict the trajectory of a selected vessel. Similar methods predict future states iteratively, where states are dependent upon the prior predictions. The method in this study, however, suggests predicting an entire trajectory, where all states are predicted jointly. Further, the method estimates a latent distribution of the possible future trajectories of the selected vessel. By sampling from this distribution, multiple trajectories are predicted. The uncertainties of the predicted vessel positions are also quantified in this study.","Collision avoidance,Autoencoder,Trajectory prediction,AIS,Machine learning,Maritime situation awareness,"

Meanwhile, the IoT devices are resource-constrained and cannot implement the existing security systems, making them susceptible to various types of debilitating cyber-attacks. The dynamics in the attack processes in IoT-enabled MTS networks keep changing, which makes a traditional offline or batch ML-based attack detection systems intractable to apply. This paper provides a novel approach of using an adaptive incremental passive-aggressive machine learning (AI-PAML) method to create a network attack detection system (NADS) to protect the IoT devices in an MTS environment. In this paper, we propose an NADS that utilizes a multi-access edge computing (MEC) platform to provide computational resources to execute the proposed model at a network end. Since online learning models face data saturation problems, we present an improved approximate linear dependence and a modified hybrid forgetting mechanism to filter the inefficient data and keep the detection model up-to-date. The proposed data filtering ensures that the model does not experience a rapid increase in unwarranted data, which affects the modelâ€™s attack detection rate. A Markov transition probability is applied to control the MEC selection and data offloading process by the IoT devices.

"ais data-driven ship trajectory prediction modelling and analysis based on machine learning and deep learning methods","2023","Maritime transport faces new safety challenges in an increasingly complex traffic environment caused by large-scale and high-speed ships, particularly with the introduction of intelligent and autonomous ships. It is evident that Automatic Identification System (AIS) data-driven ship trajectory prediction can effectively aid in identifying abnormal ship behaviours and reducing maritime risks such as collision, stranding, and contact. Furthermore, trajectory prediction is widely recognised as one of the critical technologies for realising safe autonomous navigation. The prediction methods and their performance are the key factors for future safe and automatic shipping. Currently, ship trajectory prediction lacks the real performance measurement and analysis of different algorithms, including classical machine learning and emerging deep learning methods. This paper aims to systematically analyse the performance of ship trajectory prediction methods and pioneer experimental tests to reveal their advantages and disadvantages as well as fitness in different scenarios involving complicated systems. To do so, five machine learning methods (i.e., Kalman Filter (KF), Support Vector Progression (SVR), Back Propagation network (BP), Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), and Random Forest (RF)) and seven deep learning methods (i.e., Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gate Recurrent Unit (GRU), Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM), Sequence to Sequence (Seq2seq), Bi-directional Gate Recurrent Unit (Bi-GRU), and Transformer) are first extracted from the state-of-the-art literature review and then employed to implement the trajectory prediction and compare their prediction performance in the real world. Three AIS datasets are collected from the waters of representative traffic features, including a normal channel (i.e., the Chengshan Jiao Promontory), complex traffic (i.e., the Zhoushan Archipelago), and a port area (i.e., Caofeidian port).

"on the interest of hexagonal abstraction of maritime information","2022","Worldwide maritime traffic not only is expanding rapidly but also faces numerous fluctuations, sometimes downwards, due particularly to changes in socio-economic relations between countries, the recent pandemic situation, and conflicts that may affect strategic maritime areas or climate change that may, for example, affect the location of halieutic resources. The study of maritime mobilities and spaces is therefore more essential than ever.

"data-driven trajectory quality improvement for promoting intelligent vessel traffic services in 6g-enabled maritime iot systems","2021","Future generation communication systems, such as 5G and 6G wireless systems, exploit the combined satellite-terrestrial communication infrastructures to extend network coverage and data throughput for data-driven applications. These ground-breaking techniques have promoted the rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT) in maritime industries. In maritime IoT applications, intelligent vessel traffic services can be guaranteed by collecting and analyzing high volume of spatial data flows from automatic identification system (AIS). This AIS system includes a highly integrated automatic equipment, including functionalities of core communication, tracking, and sensing. The increased utilization of shipboard AIS devices allows the collection of massive trajectory data. However, the received raw AIS data often suffers from undesirable outliers (i.e., poorly tracked timestamped points for vessel trajectories) during signal acquisition and analog-to-digital conversion. The degraded AIS data will bring negative effects on vessel traffic services (e.g., maritime traffic monitoring, intelligent maritime navigation, vessel collision avoidance, etc.) in maritime IoT scenarios. To improve the quality of vessel trajectory records from AIS networks, we propose to develop a two-phase data-driven machine learning framework for vessel trajectory reconstruction. In particular, a density-based clustering method is introduced in the first phase to automatically recognize the undesirable outliers. The second phase proposes a bidirectional long short-term memory (BLSTM)-based supervised learning technique to restore the timestamped points degraded by random outliers in vessel trajectories. Comprehensive experiments on simulated and realistic data sets have verified the dominance of our two-phase vessel reconstruction framework compared to other competing methods. It thus has the capacity of promoting intelligent vessel traffic services in 6G-enabled maritime IoT systems.","short-term memory-based supervised learning technique,maritime traffic monitoring,recurrent neural nets,supervised learning technique,intelligent maritime navigation,data-driven applications,AIS networks,Internet of Things,Monitoring,neural networks,6G-enabled maritime IoT systems,vessel collision avoidance,time stamped point restoration,shipboard AIS devices,BLSTM,two-phase vessel reconstruction framework,spatial data,5G mobile communication,automatic identification system,maritime IoT applications,supervised learning,vessel traffic services,signal reconstruction,intelligent vessel traffic services,6G mobile communication,pattern clustering,vessel trajectories,Artificial intelligence,analogue-digital conversion,two-phase data-driven machine,raw AIS data system,telecommunication traffic,maritime Internet of Things (IoT),6G wireless systems,integrated automatic equipment,Trajectory,signal detection,vessel trajectory reconstruction,marine communication,automatic identification system (AIS),Navigation,maritime industries,bidirectional long short-term memory,combined satellite-terrestrial communication,data-driven trajectory quality improvement,massive trajectory data,future generation communication systems,"

"data gap analysis of ship and maritime data using meta learning","2021","With the developments in new Internet of Things (IoT) technology, ship owners and managers can access and analyze vast amounts of real-time onboard data. However, data collected from the ship’s engine and navigation information include various types of errors owing to imprecision, bias, sensor failure, or human error caused by manual recording by the ship operator’s hands. Such abnormal data make accurate ship performance prediction and monitoring difficult; thus, the original data need to be carefully refined through data preprocessing. Machine learning models have been used to detect and remove abnormal data; however, this yields inconsistent predictions in results depending on the types of machine learning models used. In this study, a robust data gap analysis method is proposed to detect abnormal data among ship and marine data collected in real time. Data preprocessing, including rule-based data imputation, clustering, denoising, and dimension reduction, is systematically performed; subsequently, a meta-learning model, which is a combination of various machine learning models, is used to predict ship performance and detect its abnormal data. This study compared the performance of single-machine learning models and meta models through various error analysis methods that utilize actual ship operation data. The single machine leading models have various error values depending on types of data and models, while the meta model consistently has values of less than 5% of mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and relative root-mean-square error (RRMSE), showing a Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient(NSE) value of 0.7 or higher. Our proposed data gap analysis framework, including the meta-learning model, can be useful for monitoring the condition of ships, as it can more accurately and robustly classify them as normal or abnormal.","Data preprocessing,Machine learning error measures,Meta learning,Data gap analysis,"

We here relate these concepts to the JDL fusion model and demonstrate the power of Markov Logic Networks (MLNs) for encoding uncertain knowledge and compute inferences according to observed evidence. MLNs combine the expressive power of first-order logic and the probabilistic uncertainty management of Markov networks. Within this framework, different types of knowledge (e.g. a priori, contextual) with associated uncertainty can be fused together for situation assessment by expressing unobservable complex events as a logical combination of simpler evidences. We also develop a mechanism to evaluate the level of completion of complex events and show how, along with event probability, it could provide additional useful information to the operator.

"an unsupervised reconstruction-based fault detection algorithm for maritime components","2019","In recent years, the reliability and safety requirements of ship systems have increased drastically. This has prompted a paradigm shift toward the development of prognostics and health management (PHM) approaches for these systems' critical maritime components. In light of harsh environmental conditions with varying operational loads, and a lack of fault labels in the maritime industry generally, any PHM solution for maritime components should include independent and intelligent fault detection algorithms that can report faults automatically. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised reconstruction-based fault detection algorithm for maritime components. The advantages of the proposed algorithm are verified on five different data sets of real operational run-to-failure data provided by a highly regarded industrial company. Each data set is subject to a fault at an unknown time step.

"anomaly detection with unknown anomalies: application to maritime machinery","2021","We present a framework for deriving anomaly detection algorithms on timeseries data when the time and expression of anomalous behaviour is unknown. The framework is suited for problems in which individual machine learning paradigms cannot be directly implemented: supervised learning is not applicable due to the lack of labelled data, unsupervised learning is not effective since the normal operations are insufficiently defined and take complex and diverse forms, and deep learning risks confusing problematic behaviours for expected ones due to the possible repetitiveness of similar anomalies. The proposed approach is comprised of two phases: unsupervised discovery of anomalies, and semi-supervised construction and tuning of the anomaly detection algorithm. By leveraging data exploration methods and expert knowledge, the resulting algorithms are interpretable and detect a wide range of anomalous behaviours. The approach is applied to the early detection of wear and tear of maritime propulsion and manoeuvring machinery. We show that the final algorithm is able to detect different types of anomalies, including an actual internal leakage in a thruster which is otherwise overlooked by the present rule-based alarm system.","diagnosis,predictive maintenance,condition-based monitoring,machine learning,anomaly detection,grey-box modelling,fault detection,"
"a smart predict-then-optimize method for targeted and cost-effective maritime transportation","2023","In maritime transportation, port state control (PSC) is the last line of defense against substandard ships. During a PSC inspection, PSC officers (PSCOs) identify ship deficiencies that lead to a ship's detention, which can cause severe economic and reputational losses to the ship operator. Therefore, this study innovatively uses PSC inspection data to design ship maintenance plans for ship operators to minimize overall operational costs. We identify three types of operational costs associated with each deficiency code: inspection cost, repair cost, and risk cost in the ship operators’ decision-making process. The risk cost of a deficiency code is strongly related to the detention contribution of the deficiency items under a deficiency code, as indicated by the feature importance of that code in the random forest (RF) model used to predict detention outcomes. To design ship maintenance plans, the sequential predict-then-optimize (PO) method typically solves the optimization problem using input parameters, including the predicted probabilities of having deficiency items under each code and the three types of operational costs. However, the loss function in this two-stage framework does not consider the effect of predictions on the downstream decisions. Hence, we use a smart predict-then-optimize (SPO) method using an ensemble of SPO trees (SPOTs). Each SPOT uses an SPO loss function that measures the sub-optimality of the decisions derived from the predicted parameters. By exploiting the structural properties of the optimization problem analyzed in this study, we demonstrate that training an SPOT for this problem can be simplified tremendously by using the relative class frequency of true labels within a leaf node to yield a minimum SPO loss. Computational experiments show that the SPO-based ship maintenance scheme is superior to other schemes and can reduce a ship's total operating expenses by approximately 1% over the PO-based scheme and by at least 3% over schemes that do not use machine learning methods. In the long run, SPO-based ship maintenance plans also improve the efficiency of port logistics by reducing the resources needed for formal PSC inspections and alleviating port congestion.","Prescriptive analytics,Data-driven optimization,Port state control (PSC) inspection,Ship maintenance planning,"
"an optimized back propagation neural network for automated evaluation of health condition using sensor data","2023","Ships and other large equipment must meet strict standards for equipment integrity and operational dependability in order to perform missions. To meet this demand, one of the essential linkages is to guarantee the long-term safe and healthy functioning of their power transmission equipment. The Optimized Back Propagation Neural Network (OBPNN) technique used in this study introduces a unique method for monitoring sensor data and evaluating the health state, with the SVM being optimized using the fish swarm algorithm (FSA). A major problem that maintenance is facing nowadays is reliable fault prediction. One of the trickiest difficulties is arguably automatically modelling typical behaviour from condition monitoring data, particularly when there is little information about actual failures. A data-driven learning framework with the best bandwidth selection is suggested to address this challenge. It is based on nonparametric density estimation for outlier identification and OBPNN for normality modelling. The distance to the separating hyper plane's log-normalization is used to provide a health score that is also available. The algorithm's viability is shown by experimental findings while evaluating the progression of a major defect over time in a marine diesel engine. Improved prediction capabilities and low false positive rates on healthy data are realized.","Condition monitoring,Fault prediction,Optimized back propagation neural network,Health status assessment,Fish swarm algorithm,Machine learning,"

The association rules extracted are then processed through the Social Network Analysis to represent such relationships, facilitate their comprehension, and identify the existence of communities of nodes to detect critical patterns and locate the most influential nodes. The knowledge of such details can provide helpful support in terms of awareness of the plant and the development of intelligent maintenance procedures.

"modulation recognition in maritime multipath channels: a blind equalization-aided deep learning approach","2020","Modulation recognition has been long investigated in the literature, however, the performance could be severely degraded in multipath fading channels especially for high-order Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) signals. This could be a critical problem in the broadband maritime wireless communications, where various propagation paths with large differences in the time of arrival are very likely to exist. Specifically, multiple paths may stem from the direct path, the reflection paths from the rough sea surface, and the refraction paths from the atmospheric duct, respectively. To address this issue, we propose a novel blind equalization-aided deep learning (DL) approach to recognize QAM signals in the presence of multipath propagation.

With predefined searching step-sizes for the blind equalization algorithm, which are designed according to the set of modulation formats of interest, the DL network is trained and tested over various multipath channel parameter settings. It is shown that as compared to the conventional DL approaches without equalization, the proposed method can achieve an improvement in the recognition accuracy up to 30% in severe multipath scenarios, especially in the high SNR regime.

"a sensitivity quantification approach to significance analysis of thrusters in dynamic positioning operations","2021","The safety of offshore operations is highly dependent on the dynamic positioning (DP) capability of a vessel. Meanwhile, DP capability comes down to the ability of the thrust generated by thrusters to counteract environmental forces. Therefore, it is significant to investigate which thrusters are important to the position-keeping ability of vessels. However, complex environmental factors make the investigation of thrusters' importance more complicated. Hence, this paper proposes a new method to identify the influence of each thruster on vessel's station-keeping capability in different sea states. The station-keeping capability is quantified by a defined synthesized positioning ability criterion comprised by vessel position, heading angle, and consumed power. Through the comparison of different machine learning approaches, support vector machine (SVM) is used for building a surrogate model between DP capability and thrusters. In order to determine the most sensitive thruster in the whole process of vessel operation, an improved sensitivity analysis (SA) called ‘PAWN’ is employed along with statistical analysis to evaluate the significance of thrusters from different perspectives. Seventeen cases are investigated with respect to different thruster failures in various sea states. The results show the proposed method is able to identify the significance of each thruster in different scenarios.","Statistical analysis,Sensitivity analysis,Dynamic positioning capability,Thruster failures,"

This work overcomes the limitations of the existing works that lack practicability in the sense that the ex-post analyses are conducted to suggest accident prevention strategies but maritime accidents are not analyzed holistically. Using extensive literature reviews and expert interviews, a large number of risk factors associated with maritime accidents are identified, and related data are collected and utilized in the work. Throughout variable selection, data retrieval, hot-spot identification, and the maritime accident prediction model construction process, various machine learning algorithms are exploited in order to construct an organized system. In addition, interpretations for the resulting accident predictions are given using interpretable machine learning algorithms so as to provide explainable results to users. Finally, the proposed system is evaluated using a SERVQUAL model and proves its effectiveness in real-world applications.","Human factors,Predictive models,Risk management,Safety,accident prediction,Bayes methods,ocean engineering,Accidents,Machine learning,interpretable machine learning,Maritime accident,"

"anomaly detection in vessel tracks using bayesian networks","2014","In recent years electronic tracking has provided voluminous data on vessel movements, leading researchers to try various data mining techniques to find patterns and, especially, deviations from patterns, i.e., for anomaly detection. Here we describe anomaly detection with data mined Bayesian Networks, learning them from real world Automated Identification System (AIS) data, and from supplementary data, producing both dynamic and static Bayesian network models. We find that the learned networks are quite easy to examine and verify despite incorporating a large number of variables. We also demonstrate that combining dynamic and static modelling approaches improves the coverage of the overall model and thereby anomaly detection performance.","Models of normality,Maritime data,Anomaly detection,Machine learning,Bayesian networks,AIS,"
"research into vessel behaviour pattern recognition in the maritime domain: past, present and future","2021","A comprehensive literature review on vessel behaviour pattern recognition in maritime and littoral environments, spanning a period of three decades, is presented. A vast majority of research focuses on anomalous vessel behaviour detection from Automated Identification System (AIS) data, using artificial intelligence (AI), Bayesian networks and machine learning based methods. AIS is a cooperative system that employs VHF transceivers to share vessel information through terrestrial and satellite communication networks. To track small boats not fitted with AIS, uncooperative surveillance systems are employed. These systems have been studied in a relatively small number of publications. In vessel behaviour pattern recognition, target classification is critically important, particularly, in asymmetric warfare situations. The paper concludes with a discussion of future outlook in vessel behaviour pattern recognition research.","Vessel behaviour recognition,Target tracking,Pattern of life,Anomaly detection,Plan recognition,Bayesian networks,Target classification,"
"deeptracks: geopositioning maritime vehicles in video acquired from a moving platform","2021","Geopositioning and tracking a moving boat at sea is a very challenging problem, requiring boat detection, matching and estimating its GPS location from imagery with no common features. The problem can be stated as follows: given imagery from a camera mounted on a moving platform with known GPS location as the only valid sensor, we predict the geoposition of a target boat visible in images. Our solution uses recent ML algorithms, the camera-scene geometry and Bayesian filtering. The proposed pipeline first detects and tracks the target boatâ€™s location in the image with the strategy of tracking by detection. This image location is then converted to geoposition to the local sea coordinates referenced to the camera GPS location using plane projective geometry. Finally, target boat local coordinates are transformed to global GPS coordinates to estimate the geoposition. To achieve a smooth geotrajectory, we apply unscented Kalman filter (UKF) which implicitly overcomes small detection errors in the early stages of the pipeline. We tested the performance of our approach using GPS ground truth and show the accuracy and speed of the estimated geopositions. The source code will be made public once the paper is accepted.","Pipelines,DeepTracks,Kalman filters,Object Tracking by Detection,geoposition,Prediction algorithms,global GPS,Bayes methods,Cameras,Bayesian filtering,camera GPS location,pipeline,maritime vehicle geopositioning,Global Positioning System,image location,Unscented Kalman Filter,UKF,Filtering,camera-scene geometry,boats,unscented Kalman filter,Target tracking,cameras,object detection,video signal processing,moving platform,boat detection,marine engineering computing,GPS ground truth,plane projective geometry,local sea coordinates,Plane Projective Geometry,Boats,Geopositioning,GPS location,moving boat,ML algorithms,Deep Learning,target boat local coordinates,"
"engine vibration anomaly detection in vessel engine room","2022","Unsupervised and autonomous operations require new, more efficient, and smarter technical solutions. Digitalization is one of the enablers of autonomous operation, with installing new sensors and using the data for AI and machine learning. The trend is to move the handling the vast amount of data from sensors, installed in machines, and devices, close to the sensors. This way, data communication can be heavily reduced, while the latency of decisions based on data can be minimal. This is achieved by moving the advanced data analysis capabilities from the cloud to the edge. In this paper, the driver of technological development is the concept of an unmanned machine room, where the normal inspections performed by personnel are automated using sensors and algorithms.We present an analysis of vibration data, recorded at a cruise ferry\x92s engines, using a signal processing method called cepstrums. A cepstrum is a version of frequency analysis, intending to identify and visualize periodic structures in data using cepstrograms. Compared to spectrogram analysis, usage of cepstrogram enables better visualization of engine behavior into the shape of audio signals. This helped us discover the run-time vibration routine of the engines from where we could observe unusual vibration sensing generated from the engine. We started studying the unusual behavior and came to the conclusion that the engine is sometimes misfiring the cylinders, generating anomalies","anomaly,unmanned machine room,edge computing,vibration analysis,cepstrum,data communication,autonomous operation,unsupervised,"
"ship trajectory prediction based on machine learning and deep learning: a systematic review and methods analysis","2023","Ship trajectory prediction based on Automatic Identification System (AIS) data has attracted increasing interest as it helps prevent collision accidents and eliminate potential navigational conflicts. Therefore, it is necessary and urgent to conduct a systematic analysis of all the prediction methods to help reveal their advantages to ensure safety at sea in different scenarios. It is particularly important and significant within the context of unmanned ships forming a new hybrid maritime traffic together with manned ships in the future. This paper aims to conduct a comparative analysis of the up-to-date ship trajectory prediction algorithms based on machine learning and deep learning methods. To do so, five classical machine learning methods (i.e., Kalman Filter, Gaussian Process Regression, Support Vector Regression, Random Forest, and Back Propagation Network) and eight deep learning methods (i.e., Recurrent Neural Networks, Long Short-Term Memory, Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory, Gate Recurrent Unit, Bi-directional Gate Recurrent Unit, Sequence to Sequence, Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network, and Transformer) are thoroughly analysed and compared from the algorithm essence and applications to excavate their features and adaptability for manned and unmanned ships. The findings reveal the characteristics of various prediction methods and provide valuable implications for different stakeholders to guide the best-fit choice of a particular method as the solution under a specific circumstance. It also makes contributions to the extraction of the research difficulties of ship trajectory prediction and the corresponding solutions that are put forward to guide the development of future research.","Deep learning,Maritime safety,Hybrid maritime traffic,Trajectory prediction,AIS data,Machine learning,"
"a deep spatiotemporal approach in maritime accident prediction: a case study of the territorial sea of south korea","2023","Predicting the risk of maritime accidents is crucial for improving traffic surveillance and marine safety. The availability of data sources and development of machine learning and deep learning methodologies can improve operational risk prediction. Similar to larger vessels, numerous ocean accidents are caused by small- and medium-sized vessels owing to poor conditions and defective equipment. This study aims at investigating the application of deep learning in both short- and long-term predictions of different types of accident risks associated with small vessels by considering multiple influencing factors. Herein, several big data sources that contain data collected from the territorial sea of South Korea, including ocean accidents, ocean depth, weather data, and small vessel trajectories, are utilized. Four machine learning and six deep learning algorithms are implemented and compared in nine scenarios with three different grid sizes using daily, weekly, and monthly models. The results reveal that although the performance of the proposed deep spatiotemporal ocean accident prediction (DSTOAP) model varies according to grid sizes and time intervals, its accuracy (more than 78%) makes it reliable for predicting accidents. Furthermore, although all types of accidents are captured with high accuracy, more than 84% of collision accidents can be predicted accurately. For practical applications, the results of this study can guide ocean accident management and safety planners in choosing appropriate methods for different time schedules and grid sizes, according to the range of coverage of the patrol ship.","Maritime risk,Deep learning,Vessel trajectory,Ocean accident prediction,"

"a comparative research of machine learning impact to future of maritime transportation","2019","Machine Learning (ML) can be defined as a level of algorithm which may allow software applications to create more accurate in forecasting outputs without being external programmed. Since maritime transportation requires smart technologies, adaptation of machine learning tools might provide utmost benefit for efficiency, sustainability and reduction of operational costs. As the data is core element to unlocking the uncertainty, it may help to improve shipping. So far, the data acquisition on maritime transportation is quite limited. Therefore, adaptation of machine learning techniques in the maritime transportation is narrow as compared to other industries. The aim of this paper is to discuss machine learning applications and their impacts to future of maritime transportation industry. A sets of comparative researches will be undertaken to present current situation and potential impacts to future in maritime transportation.

"bayes' theorem based maritime safety information classifier","2018","In order to ensure the safe navigation of ships, the Global Maritime Distress and Safety System was incorporated into the Safety of Life at Sea regulations, and the amendment has already came into force. Became mandatory for compulsorily fitted craft, the system includes an important Maritime Safety Information Broadcasting System. Nowadays, due to the lack of relevant norms, the seafarers in many sea areas still need to read and identify the theme of the messages artificially, with low efficiency and accuracy. To solve this problem, several machine learning based solutions have been presented and analyzed. However, a mathematically solidly founded naive Bayes classifier did now show its best during the previous research. Thus, the Bayes' Theorem based classifier is explored in detail.

"from unsupervised to semi-supervised anomaly detection methods for hrrp targets","2020","Responding to the challenge of detecting unusual radar targets in a well identified environment, innovative anomaly and novelty detection methods keep emerging in the literature. This work aims at presenting a benchmark gathering common and recently introduced unsupervised anomaly detection (AD) methods, the results being generated using high-resolution range profiles. A semi-supervised AD (SAD) is considered to demonstrate the added value of having a few labeled anomalies to improve performances. Experiments were conducted with and without pollution of the training set with anomalous samples in order to be as close as possible to real operational contexts. The common AD methods composing our baseline will be One-Class Support Vector Machines (OC-SVM), Isolation Forest (IF), Local Outlier Factor (LOF) and a Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE). The more innovative AD methods put forward by this work are Deep Support Vector Data Description (Deep SVDD) and Random Projection Depth (RPD), belonging respectively to deep and shallow AD. The semi-supervised adaptation of Deep SVDD constitutes our SAD method.

"system architecture for real-time condition monitoring and anomaly detection on ships","2023","Sea-based rescue organizations play a vital role in maritime civil security by resolving offshore emergencies, securing sea routes, and monitoring critical naval infrastructure. However, increasing marine traffic makes rescue operations more difficult, demanding better organization and orchestration of available resources. Therefore, ensuring efficient maintenance, availability and timely deployment of rescue cruisers is of great importance, particularly in rough sea conditions. To achieve this, we design an AI-based system for predictive maintenance and condition monitoring that enables real-time analyses of the shipâ€™s sensory data and the detection of anomalies in the system behavior. In this paper, we detail our software and hardware architecture for these purposes, and we discuss the respective requirements regarding onboard and off-ship data analysis from various data sources (sensor data, camera data, weather data). We underpin our approach by emulating data flows derived from sensory data. Finally, we provide the first results in AI-based anomaly detection, allowing, for instance, early engine malfunctions identification before the actual failure occurs.","Machine Learning,Condition Monitoring,Computer architecture,Systems architecture,Soft sensors,Real-time systems,Anomaly Detection,Ship Sensory Data,Condition monitoring,System Architecture,Organizations,Hardware,"
"data-driven prognostics using a combination of constrained k-means clustering, fuzzy modeling and lof-based score","2017","Today, failure modes characterization and early detection is a key issue in complex assets. This is due to the negative impact of corrective operations and the conservative strategies usually put in practice, focused on preventive maintenance. In this paper anomaly detection issue is addressed in new monitoring sensor data by characterizing and modeling operational behaviors. The learning framework is performed on the basis of a machine learning approach that combines constrained K-means clustering for outlier detection and fuzzy modeling of distances to normality. A final score is also calculated over time, considering the membership degree to resulting fuzzy sets and a local outlier factor. Proposed solution is deployed in a CBM+ platform for online monitoring of the assets. In order to show the validity of the approach, experiments have been conducted on real operational faults in an auxiliary marine diesel engine. Experimental results show a fully comprehensive yet accurate prognostics approach, improving detection capabilities and knowledge management. The performance achieved is quite high (precision, sensitivity and specificity above 93% and κ=0.93), even more so given that a very small percentage of real faults are present in data.","Local outlier factor,Constrained k-means clustering,Behavior characterization,Machine learning,Fuzzy modeling,Condition monitoring,"
"securing iot based maritime transportation system through entropy-based dual-stack machine learning framework","2023","Internet of Things (IoTs) is envisaged to widely capture the realm of logistics and transportation services in future. The applications of ubiquitous IoTs have been extended to Maritime Transportation Systems (MTS) that spawned increasing security threats; posing serious fiscal concerns to stakeholders involved. Among these threats, Distributed Denial of Service Attack (DDoS) is ranked very high that can wreak havoc on IoT artifacts of the MTS networks. Timely and effective detection of such attacks is imperative for necessary mitigation. Conventional approaches exploit entropy of attributes in network traffic for detecting DDoS attacks. However, the majority of these approaches are static in nature and consider only a few network traffic parameters, limiting the number of DDoS attack detection to a few types and intensities. In current research, a novel framework named â€œDual Stack Machine Learning (S2ML)â€ has been proposed to calculate distinct entropy-based varying 10-Tuple (T) features from network traffic features, three window sizes and associated Rate of Exponent Separation (RES). These features have been exploited for developing an intelligent model over MTS-IoT datasets to successfully detect multiple types of DDoS attacks in MTS. S2ML is an efficient framework that overcomes the shortcomings of prevalent DDoS detection approaches, as evident from the comparison with Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), Alternating Decision Tree (ADT) and Simple Logistic Regression (SLR) over different evaluation metrics (Confusion metrics, ROCs). The proposed S2ML technique outperforms prevalent ones with 1.5% better results compared to asserted approaches on distribution of normal/attack traffic.

"multi-label classification for ais data anomaly detection using wavelet transform","2022","Thanks to the Automatic Identification System (AIS), ships and other maritime equipment are able to communicate with each other, for example, by sending information about their position. This solution allows for early collision detection when two or more ships are on a collision course. In the newer version of AIS, a satellite infrastructure is used to extend the communication range. Unfortunately, satellite AIS deals with so-called packet collision effect: since there is a problem with synchronizing AIS data coming from multiple terrestrial areas, a single satellite may receive several AIS messages at the same time and be unable to correctly process them, causing the data to get lost or garbled. In this article, a machine learning based framework for detecting the incorrect AIS data is presented. In this approach, after the first stage (clustering), a dedicated anomaly detection algorithm searches for damaged AIS messages and conducts multi-label classification (with Random Forest and wavelet transform) to decide which fields of such message requires further correction. The results of measuring the effectiveness of the proposed approach using real AIS data are presented.","telecommunication security,Clustering algorithms,incorrect AIS data,single satellite,Anomaly detection,Wavelet transforms,anomaly detection,random forests,collision course,Marine vehicles,Machine learning,damaged AIS messages,Data analysis,dedicated anomaly detection algorithm searches,satellite communication,ships,wavelet transform,pattern classification,random forest,Classification algorithms,multiple terrestrial areas,pattern clustering,machine learning based framework,Artificial intelligence,multi-label classification,multilabel classification,wavelet transforms,satellite infrastructure,AIS data anomaly detection,maritime equipment,communication range,Trajectory,marine communication,Labeling,early collision detection,AIS data analysis,packet collision effect,satellite AIS deals,"

"an artificial intelligence model considering data imbalance for ship selection in port state control based on detention probabilities","2021","Port state control inspection is seen as a safety net to guard marine safety, protect the marine environment, and guarantee decent onboard working and living conditions for seafarers. A substandard ship can be detained in an inspection if serious deficiencies are found onboard. Ship detention is regarded as a severe result in port state control inspection. However, developing accurate prediction models for ship detention based on ship’s generic factors (e.g. ship age, type, and flag), dynamic factors (e.g. times of ship flag changes), and inspection historical factors (e.g. total previous detentions in PSC inspection, last PSC inspection time, and last deficiency number in PSC inspection) before an inspection is conducted is not a trivial task as the low detention rate leads to a highly imbalanced inspection records dataset. To address this issue, this paper develops a classification model called balanced random forest (BRF) to predict ship detention by using 1,600 inspection records at the Hong Kong port for three years. Numerical experiments show that the proposed BRF model can identify 81.25% of all the ships with detention in the test set which contains another 400 inspection records. Compared with the current ship selection method at the Hong Kong port, the BRF model is much more efficient and can achieve an average improvement of 73.72% in detained ship identification.","imbalanced data,machine learning in maritime transportation,ship detention,Port state control inspection,artificial intelligence in maritime transportation,"
