"fast cnn surveillance pipeline for fine-grained vessel classification and detection in maritime scenarios","2016","Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have proven very effective for many vision benchmarks in object detection and classification tasks. However, the computational complexity and object resolution requirements of CNNs limit their applicability in wide-view video surveillance settings where objects are small. This paper presents a CNN surveillance pipeline for vessel localization and classification in maritime video. The proposed pipeline is build upon the GPU implementation of Fast-R-CNN with three main steps:(1) Vessel filtering and regions proposal using low-cost weak object detectors based on hand-engineered features. (2) Deep CNN features of the candidates regions are computed with one feed-forward pass from the high-level layer of a fine-tuned VGG16 network. (3) Fine-grained classification is performed using CNN features and a support vector machine classifier with linear kernel for object verification. The performance of the proposed pipeline is compared with other popular CNN architectures with respect to detection accuracy and evaluation speed. The proposed approach mAP of 61.10% was the comparable with Fast-R-CNN but with a 10Ã— speed up (on the order of Faster-R-CNN) on the new Annapolis Maritime Surveillance Dataset.","Pipelines,Support vector machines,object verification,Feature extraction,maritime video,maritime scenarios,neural nets,GPU,linear kernel,fine-grained vessel detection,fine-grained vessel classification,support vector machines,deep convolutional neural networks,pipelines,Proposals,object detection,image classification,feed-forward pass,support vector machine classifier,fast-R-CNN,Object detection,Surveillance,fast CNN surveillance pipeline,VGG16 network,Detectors,Annapolis maritime surveillance dataset,"
"rep-enhancer: re-parameterizing neural network for real-time low-light enhancement in visual maritime surveillance","2022","Vision-based maritime surveillance has become an essential part of the vessel traffic services system. The images collected in low-light maritime conditions often suffer from poor visibility. These images may significantly degenerate the performance of high-level visual tasks and increase the uncertainty in maritime surveillance. To address this problem, we propose a lightweight neural network (Rep-Enhancer) for low-light image enhancement. Specifically, we first design a re-parameterizable multi-branch edge extraction module, i.e., spatial domain-oriented convolution block (SDCB). Furthermore, skip connections and spatial attention operations are employed to strengthen the features. By exploiting these well-strengthened edge features, we can enhance the low-light images effectively with the encoder-decoder structure. The experimental results have shown that Rep-Enhancer can enhance the low-light image qualifiedly while maintaining great inference efficiency.","Traffic control,Image edge detection,surveillance,low-light images,low-light,Image enhancement,vessel traffic services system,lightweight neural network,high-level visual tasks,Rep-Enhancer,Feature extraction,image enhancement,Neural networks,edge detection,Visual effects,well-strengthened edge features,low-light maritime conditions,edge feature,maritime surveillance,computer vision,object detection,re-parameterization,multibranch edge extraction module,feature extraction,real-time low-light enhancement,visual maritime surveillance,spatial domain-oriented convolution block,low-light image enhancement,convolutional neural nets,Uncertainty,Surveillance,vision-based maritime surveillance,"

"a comparative investigation of data-driven approaches based on one-class classifiers for condition monitoring of marine machinery system","2020","The safety and reliability of ship navigation depend heavily on the performance of the marine machinery system, which can be maintained at a high level by condition based maintenance. Intelligent condition monitoring is the key to achieve condition based maintenance. However, it is not easy to realize intelligent condition monitoring in a real ship, because there are not enough labeled fault samples to train an accurate detection model. In fact, the potential value of a large number of normal samples collected by the shipboard monitoring system has not been mined out. Since one-class classifiers only need one-class samples to train the detection models, they are very suitable for such occasions. In this paper, we investigate the performance of several representative one-class classifiers, such as OCSVM (One class support vector machine), SVDD (Support vector data description), GKNN (Global k-nearest neighbors), LOF (Local outlier factor), IForest (Isolation forest) and ABOD (Angle-based outlier detection), in condition monitoring of the marine machinery system. The dataset of a marine gas turbine propulsion system is used for a case study, which is a simulation dataset verified by the real ship data. Compared with previous literatures, our new work is to investigate the performance of a variety of key one-class classifiers, not only considering the common evaluation indexes for machine learning, but also considering the sample combinations of the training dataset, distribution of misclassified samples, and the tolerance to contaminated data. The experimental results show that these algorithms have good performance in the dataset in some common evaluation indexes. However, they show some obvious performance differences in some novel evaluation indexes we proposed. This can provide decision support for the application of one-class classifiers in the condition monitoring of many other marine machinery systems.","One-class classifier,Marine machinery,Condition based maintenance,Condition monitoring,"

To further evaluate the performance of the method in severe weather conditions, we also used a flexible data enhancement strategy to generate a diverse synthetic test datasets, including different conditions such as rain, fog, and low illumination. Based on this datasets, we constructed a test datasets specifically for small vessel target detection, in which we evaluated the proposed approach. Experimental results show that compared with other mainstream competing algorithms such as Faster R-CNN, YOLOv3, YOLOv4, and YOLOX, our method has superior performance in terms of detection accuracy, robustness, and efficiency. In addition, the proposed method proves its good adaptability in ship detection under harsh imaging conditions.

"research on ship abnormal behavior detection method based on graph neural network","2022","Because of the existing maritime intelligent supervision, ship abnormal behavior detection ignores the interdependence between different time series of ships and different abnormal behavior characteristics, which leads to poor real-time performance and limited detection accuracy of abnormal detection. This paper explores the mechanism of ship abnormal behavior monitoring and detection based on graph attention network. This mechanism uses a sliding window to generate fixed data input, uses graph attention network to capture the dependence between ship behavior characteristics, and determines the threshold of anomaly according to the sea environment set in this paper.

"a novel model for ship trajectory anomaly detection based on gaussian mixture variational autoencoder","2023","The use of traditional methods in anomaly detection of multi-class ship trajectories showed some limitations in terms of robustness and learning ability of trajectory features. In view of this, an anomaly detection model for ship trajectory data based on Gaussian Mixture Variational Autoencoder (GMVAE) is proposed in this study using an unsupervised classification method. The proposed model modifies Variational Autoencoder (VAE) by changing the inferential distribution of prior distribution and approximate posterior to the Gaussian mixture model. A high-dimensional hidden space is constructed to learn the features of multi-class trajectory data, and the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) method is applied to measure the error between the reconstructed trajectory and the original trajectory in order to judge whether the ship trajectory is abnormal. The Automatic Identification System (AIS) data from the US coastal areas are used to verify the proposed model, and the results are compared with other commonly used models in a manually labeled dataset. The research results indicate that the detection rate of the proposed model is 91.26%, and the false alarm rate is 0.68%, which performs the best. Using the Gaussian mixture model to describe the distribution of hidden space can improve the learning ability of multi-class trajectories of VAE, thus increasing the robustness of the model. This research can provide technical support for ship trajectory data analysis and risk management of maritime transportation.","Trajectory,anomaly detection of ship trajectory,Clustering algorithms,Classification algorithms,Mathematical models,gaussian mixture variational autoencoder (gmvae),unsupervised learning,Gaussian distribution,Marine vehicles,Artificial neural networks,intelligent transportation,AIS,"
"reliability analysis with corrosion defects in submarine pipeline case study: oil pipeline in ab-khark island","2022","The offshore industry widely uses offshore pipelines to transport petroleum products due to their high capacity and reasonable installation costs. Corrosion is the leading failure cause of offshore pipelines, and their reliability analysis is necessary for reducing maintenance costs. This study presents a corrosion analysis in the bursting mode of the pipeline using a codified method based on probabilistic space theory, considering the monitored data of the oil pipeline and the pigging data of the AB-KHARK pipeline. The relationship between pigging data, parameters affecting corrosion, and the reduction of pipe wall thickness are determined based on the indicators of Regression and Neural Network machine learning methods. A new method is presented for modeling the failure modes of offshore pipelines based on their historical data and statistical computation results.

"a cloud based architecture capable of perceiving and predicting multiple vessel behaviour","2015","Progressively huge amounts of data, tracking vessels during their voyages across the seas, are becoming available, mostly due to the automatic identification system (AIS) that vessels of specific categories are required to carry. These datasets provide detailed insights into the patterns vessels follow, while safely navigating across the globe, under various conditions. In this paper, we develop an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) capable of predicting a vessels future behaviour (position, speed and course), based on events that occur in a predictable pattern, across large map areas. The main concept of this study is to determine if an ANN is capable of inferring the unique behavioural patterns that each vessel follows and successively use this as a means for predicting multiple vessel behaviour into a future point in time. We design, train and implement a proof of concept ANN, as a cloud based web application, with the ability of overlaying predicted short and long term vessel behaviour on an interactive map. Our proposed approach could potentially assist in busy port scheduling, vessel route planning, anomaly detection and increasing overall Maritime Domain Awareness.","Vessel behaviour prediction,Soft computing applications,Artificial Neural Network,Automated identification system,Maritime Domain Awareness,"

However, some of the essential data may be incomplete or unavailable. In order to recover or predict the missing information and best exploit the vessels monitoring data, this paper combines statistical analysis, data mining and neural network methods to propose a multi-task analysis and modelling framework for multi-source monitoring data of inland vessels. Specifically, an advanced neural network, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) was tailored and employed to tackle three important tasks, including vessel trajectory repair, engine speed modelling and fuel consumption prediction. The developed models have been validated using the real-life vessel monitoring data and shown to outperform some other widely used modelling methods. In addition, statistics and data technologies were employed for data extraction, classification and cleaning, and an algorithm was designed for identification of the vessel navigational state.","Trajectory repair,LSTM,Vessel monitoring,Fuel consumption,Multi-source data,Engine speed modelling,"
"fast and parameter-light rare behavior detection in maritime trajectories","2020","Rare behaviors indicate important events and situations in maritime surveillance applications. State-of-the-art methods provide many effective solutions to detect anomalous behaviors. Meanwhile, most solutions are parameter-laden and too costly to identify useful rare behaviors with human knowledge in a visual analytics manner. This paper is concerned with a scheme cross trajectories, vessel attributes and the movement context for detecting rare behaviors through preprocessing, kNN-based clustering, and verification. Although the scheme involves several parameters, we demonstrate that they are able to be tackled in thresholds. As a result, a rare behavior factor is the single parameter that affect the detecting results. The proposed scheme is evaluated via a simulated data set for performance and a real life AIS data for effectiveness. Results show that high accuracy to labelled anomalies and useful rare behaviors can be achieved.","Rare behaviour detection,Trajectory,Visual analytics,"

"an efficient multi-sensor fusion approach for object detection in maritime environments","2018","Robust real-time object detection and tracking are challenging problems in autonomous transportation systems due to operation of algorithms in inherently uncertain and dynamic environments and rapid movement of objects. Therefore, tracking and detection algorithms must cooperate with each other to achieve smooth tracking of detected objects that later can be used by the navigation system. In this paper, we first present an efficient multi-sensor fusion approach based on the probabilistic data association method in order to achieve accurate object detection and tracking results. The proposed approach fuses the detection results obtained independently from four main sensors: radar, LiDAR, RGB camera and infrared camera. It generates object region proposals based on the fused detection result. Then, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) approach is used to identify the object categories within these regions.

"towards a convolutional neural network model for classifying regional ship collision risk levels for waterway risk analysis","2020","Estimating the navigational risk of vessels operating in sea and waterway areas is important for waterway risk management and pollution preparedness and response planning. Existing methods relying on a model-informed expert judgment of ship-ship collision risk are of limited practical use because periodic risk monitoring is feasible only when this can be done without extensive use of organizational resources. To alleviate such limitations, this article presents a new approach based Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and image recognition to interpret and classify ship-ship collision risks in encounter scenarios. The specific aim of the article is to investigate whether a CNN-based model can quickly and accurately interpret images constructed based on data from the Automatic Identification System (AIS) in terms of collision risk. To test this, estimates derived from training data are compared to validation data. It is also investigated whether adding additional navigational information based on AIS data improves the model's predictive accuracy. A case study with data from the Baltic Sea area is implemented, where various model design alternatives are tested as a proof-of-concept. The main finding of this work is that a CNN-based approach can indeed meet the specified design requirements, suggesting that this is a fruitful direction for future work. Several issues requiring further research and developed are discussed, with the validity of the risk ratings underlying the image classification seen as the most significant conceptual challenge before a CNN-model can be put to practical use.","Image recognition,Maritime Safety,Convolutional Neural Network,Ship-ship collision,AIS data,Machine learning,"
"new frontiers in the risk assessment of ship collision","2023","Navigation is becoming more and more complex over the years. The increase in maritime traffic and vessel size is inducing a global escalation of ship collision accidents, with consequent losses of human lives and economic assets worth billions. This is particularly true for port basins, with maritime authorities struggling worldwide to keep up with the ever-increasing ship traffic. In this respect, the demand for advanced methods to assess and mitigate ship collision risk has never been higher. The interdependency between physical failures, weather conditions, logistics, governance and human factors requires sophisticated frameworks to effectively assist maritime authorities and navigators in decision-making. The present work reviews the most recent advancements in the risk assessment of ship collision. The article focuses on new, rising technologies, identifying the current main trends and discussing future perspectives and challenges.

"a benchmark for deep learning based object detection in maritime environments","2019","Object detection in maritime environments is a rather unpopular topic in the field of computer vision.

We analyze the utilization of deep learning techniques and therefore evaluate two state-of-the-art object detection approaches for their applicability in the maritime domain: Faster R-CNN and Mask R-CNN. To train the Mask R-CNN including the instance segmentation branch, a novel algorithm for automated generation of instance segmentation labels is introduced.

The proposed beam scheduling scheme also takes into account the imperfect detection of targets in real situation. A conventional heuristic beam scheduling approach was modified to incorporate binary integration in radar theory into the RRM strategy. The resulting scheme efficiently handles the complicated beam scheduling problem by considering the target priority as well as the imperfect detection of targets of a real maritime MFR.

"maritime uav patrol tasks based on yolov4 object detection","2022","The search and rescue operations conducted by designated maritime patrol troops usually employ ships and helicopters in their search and rescue work at sea, making it a resource-intensive undertaking both in terms of patrolling equipment and trained personnel. Oftentimes, when the victims send an SOS or call for help, the rescue unit in question can easily obtain the ship's information but cannot access prevailing maritime images of the sea, thus hindering them from swiftly controlling the accident site as effectively. This work endeavors to address this deficiency and proposes an automated patrolling operation based on small UAVs and a diverse set of maritime search patterns corresponding to different sea areas. Maritime images are collected via a deep neural network-based UAV and promptly returned to the search and rescue system. The object detection model in this case is trained using extensive images of maritime accidents collected from the network. This object detection model based on the YOLOv4 framework is thus used in the timely detection of maritime accidents. Post detection, an alarm system is set up to classify the danger level of the targets and to trigger rescue operations corresponding to the level of danger, followed by an alarm message sent to the rescuers by Short Message Service (SMS).

We propose a multi-class artificial neural network (ANN)-based anomaly detection framework to classify intentional and non-intentional AIS on-off switching anomalies. The multi-class anomaly framework captures AIS message dropouts due to various reasons, e.g., channel effects or intentional one for carrying illegal activities. We extract position, speed, course and timing information from real world AIS data, and use them to train a 2-class (normal and anomaly) and a 3-class (normal, power outage and anomaly) anomaly detection models.

"intrusion detection for maritime transportation systems with batch federated aggregation","2023","As a fast-growing and promising technology, Internet of Things (IoT) significantly promotes the informationization and intelligentization of Maritime Transportation System (MTS). The massive data collected during the voyage is usually disposed of with the assistance of cloud or edge computing, which imposes serious cyber security threats. For multifarious cyber-attacks, Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is one of the efficient mechanisms to prevent IoT devices from network intrusion. However, most of the methods based on deep learning train their models in a centralized manner, which needs uploading all data to the central server for training, increasing the risk of privacy disclosure. In this paper, we consider the characteristics of IoT-based MTS and propose a CNN-MLP based model for intrusion detection which is trained through Federated Learning, named FedBatch. Federated Learning keeps the model training local and only updates the global model through the exchange of model parameters, preserving the privacy of local data on vessels. First, the characteristics of the communication between different vessels are discussed to model the federated learning process during the voyage. Then, the lightweight local model constructed by Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Multi-Layer Perception (MLP) is designed to save on computing and storage overhead. Moreover, to mitigate the straggler problem during the federated learning in MTS, we proposed an adaptive aggregation method, named Batch Federated Aggregation, which suppresses the oscillations of model parameters during federated learning. Finally, the simulation results on the NSL-KDD dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of FedBatch.","Maritime Transportation System,CNN-MLP based model,computer network security,federated learning process,IoT,Collaborative work,deep learning (artificial intelligence),serious cyber security threats,maritime transportation systems,Internet of Things,cloud,security of data,multifarious cyber-attacks,privacy preservation,Maritime Transportation systems,deep learning,Servers,lightweight local model,model training local,Data models,massive data,network intrusion,voyage,edge computing,federated learning,IoT-based MTS,adaptive aggregation method,multilayer perceptrons,convolutional neural nets,model parameters,Training,Convolutional neural networks,Intrusion detection,Intrusion Detection System,named Batch Federated Aggregation,IoT devices,learning (artificial intelligence),data privacy,global model,"
"maritime object detection with event-based cameras","2022","Event cameras differ from conventional frame-based cameras in that each individual pixel responds independently and asynchronously to brightness changes. Instead of absolute brightness measurements reported as entire frames at regular time intervals, data from event cameras come as a stream of spatially and temporally sparse brightness change events. Event cameras have several characteristics that are favorable to maritime computer vision tasks, including high dynamic range and high temporal resolution. In this work, we apply Asynet, a sparse convolutional neural network based object detection model, to maritime event data sets we collected in the field. To address the limited size of our data set, we propose fine-tuning from pretrained weights learned from the neuromorphic Caltech101 (N-Caltech101) data set and then using a combination of augmentation techniques drawn from traditional image-based computer vision as well as event-specific augmentations.

"rainfall yield characteristics of electrical storm observed in the spanish basque country area during the period 1992–1996","2008","This paper is focused on the study of rainfall yield characteristics of electrical storms observed over the Northern Iberian Peninsula during 1992–1996. To this aim Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) method have been used. The SOM method is a group of artificial neural networks based on the topological properties of the human brain. Results clearly suggest that there exist three different meteorological patterns that are linked to the characteristics of electrical events found in the study area. In winter, most of the electrical events are formed under oceanic advection (NW air fluxes). On these cases, mean rainfall yield estimates reach values of 700 104 m3 per cloud to ground lightning flash (CG flash). During summer most frequent electrical storms are associated to local instability shooting by surface heating with advection of humidity coming from the Iberian Peninsula. Under these meteorological situations, rain is scarcer if compared with oceanic events but lightning CG counts reach the maximum values found in the area (about 10 CG counts per 20×20 km2 and day) giving this way the smallest rainfall yield with a mean value of 15 104 m3 per CG flash. Iberian air fluxes associated with cold air in upper parts of the atmosphere represent the third meteorological pattern found. This pattern is most common in spring and autumn but is not unusual in the rest of the seasons. In those cases mean rainfall yield in the area is about 150 104 m3 per CG flash. In all electrical episodes K instability index is greater than 15 °C but in the most lightning producing events, this index reaches in the area values greater than 24 °C. PCA results pointed out that there exists a relationship between rain and CG counts expressed by the first principal component computed from standardized data. However, we must notice that no event is solely linked to this axis, since a seasonal influence which decreases lightning production when rain increases is always present. Results found are of great interest for short term forecasting of flashfloods in mountainous areas like the Spanish Basque Country region.","Lightning–rain relationship,Applied physics,Northern Iberian Peninsula,Rainfall yield estimates,Fluid mechanics,Oceanic and continental lightning,"

To prove the proposed method, we also built and opened a new dataset to the community which contains VHR multiscale maritime images. Compared with the FCN and ResNet, the proposed method got much better F1 scores 85.90% for ship class and 97.54% overall accuracy.

"convolutional neural network-based novel framework for ship recognition in poor visibility maritime surveillance videos","2023","Ship recognition is a central component of the information perception for smart ships. Traditionally, the ship recognition mission is completed by remote sensing or synthetic aperture radar (SAR) or manual calibration via maritime surveillance video. However, the difficulty arises in implementing the mission when it suffers the weather with a poor visibility. The recognition accuracy may deteriorate dramatically in such a hostile environment, especially in the heavy fog environment at sea when using conventional methods. In this case, we develop a novel framework for ship recognition based on a smart recognition system that relies on the dark channel defogging and the neural networks. First, a dark-channel defogging algorithm is utilized to remove the adverse impact of poor visibility on recognition. After that, three different neural networks are used to train the defogged images (Specifically: Faster-RCNN, SSD, YOLOv3). Finally, we present qualitative and quantitative analyses of three different neural network models. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in a hostile environment, especially in fog weather with poor visibility at sea.","Image recognition,Neural networks,Ship recognition,Sea surface,Visualization,Surveillance,Robust framework,Marine vehicles,Statistical analysis,Convolutional Neural Networks,Defog method,"

"on the effectiveness of ai-assisted anomaly detection methods in maritime navigation","2020","The automatic identification system (AIS) has become an essential tool for maritime security. Nevertheless, how to effectively use the static and dynamic voyage information of the AIS data in maritime traffic situation awareness is still a challenge. This paper presents a comparative study of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques on their effectiveness in dealing with various anomalies in maritime domain using the AIS data. The AIS on-off switching (OOS) anomaly is critical in maritime security, since AIS technology is susceptible to manipulation and it can be switched on and off to hide illegal activities. Thus, we try to detect and distinguish between intentional and non-intentional AIS OOS anomalies through our AI -assisted anomaly detection framework. We use AIS data, in particular positional and navigational status of vessels, to study the effectiveness of seven AI techniques, such as artificial neural network, support vector machine, logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, decision tree, random forest and naive Bayes, in detecting the AIS OOS anomalies. Our experimental results show that ANN and SVM are the most suitable techniques in detecting the AIS OOS anomalies with 99.9% accuracy. Interestingly, the ANN model outperforms others when trained with a balanced (i.e., same order of samples per class) dataset, and SVM, on the other hand, is suitable when training dataset is unbalanced.","maritime traffic situation awareness,AI-assisted anomaly detection,decision trees,Support vector machines,logistic regression,Anomaly detection,static voyage information,random forests,ANN,marine navigation,Feature extraction,security of data,maritime security,k-nearest neighbors,regression analysis,AIS technology,naive Bayes,neural nets,naive Bayes methods,automatic identification system,marine safety,marine engineering,support vector machines,maritime navigation,dynamic voyage information,maritime domain,random forest,SVM,Artificial intelligence,AIS on-off switching anomaly,nearest neighbour methods,artificial neural network,Training,Trajectory,support vector machine,nonintentional AIS OOS anomalies,Navigation,artificial intelligence,decision tree,AIS data,"
"design of a decision support system to achieve condition-based maintenance in ship machinery systems","2023","A decision support system is proposed for the condition-based maintenance of ship machinery systems based on the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) approach. A case study is conducted for a container ship's main diesel engine. Within the scope of the methodology, the main engine power is predicted based on exhaust gas outlet temperatures of cylinders and the main engine shaft RPM. In this regard, firstly, two different strategies such as the creation of the cylinder-basis model and the development of the overall system model are developed to determine the ANFIS model structure for the analysis. Then, comparative analyses are carried out to select a suitable ANFIS structure and its specific membership functions. In addition, the estimation process is also performed by the artificial neural network (ANN) model, and its results are compared with the findings of the best ANFIS structure. The success of the constructed models is evaluated by some error metrics. The overall ANFIS model with 5 membership functions is determined as the best approach by scores of 0.9806 for R2, 1.6588 MW for RMSE, and 3.2703 for MAPE. As a result of the estimation procedure, a decision support system to assist marine operators in maintenance operations is developed.

The latter are, further, fed into a Fast-RCNN for carrying out objectness detection and box regression. Finally, a mere box post-regression operation enables to extract maritime objects.

"machine learning for shaft power prediction and analysis of fouling related performance deterioration","2021","Improving operational performance and reducing fuel consumption is increasingly important for shipping companies. Ship performance degrades over time due to hull and propeller fouling; therefore assessing when fouling effects are significant enough to warrant cleaning is critical. Advancements in onboard data logging systems, combined with machine learning techniques, unlock the potential to predict fouling effects accurately and determine when to clean. This study evaluates five models for shaft power prediction: Multiple Linear Regression, Decision Tree (AdaBoost), K – Nearest Neighbours, Artificial Neural Network and Random Forest. The importance of pre-processing is highlighted, contributing to the creation of a model with lower errors than previous studies. The significance of environmental parameters was explored, with the novel integration of wave statistics to the operational dataset, and simulated power-speed curves created from predictions to identify performance deterioration due to fouling. The Random Forest model was most effective in predicting shaft power, with an error of 1.17%.

In order to handle the amount of data required for FOC prediction, we employ a streaming pipeline that harvests data in real-time from different sources and processes them appropriately for visualization, causal analysis, and forecasting purposes. In this direction, we first conduct an exploratory analysis to examine and unveil the importance and inter-association between the various variables related to sea-keeping and weather features, in order to utilize them effectively in the context of a FOC predictive scheme.

"seaâ€“land segmentation in maritime surveillance radars via k-nearest neighbor classifier","2020","Shipborne or airborne maritime surveillance radars at scan mode work at a complex scene consisting of land, sea, and islands. Sea-land segmentation provides a two-class classification of sea clutter versus ground clutter to the surveillance scene as a precondition of adaptive target detection. It is a difficult problem because only a few coherent pulses are available at scan mode. Moreover, due to moving radar platforms and wide dynamic range of ground and sea clutter in power, average amplitude, Doppler offset, and initial phase of radar, the returns vector fails to distinguish sea clutter and ground clutter. In this article, a similarity measure of two radar returns vectors, which is invariant to amplitude, Doppler offset, and initial phase, is constructed, which is closely relevant to the Doppler bandwidth of a returns vector. Based on the similarity measure, a K-nearest neighbor classifier is proposed to yield a pixel-level sea-land segmentation of the scene. Further, the morphological filtering is operated on the pixel-level segmentation to obtain a region-level segmentation. Moreover, the discrete FrÃ©chet distances of the main boundaries in successive scan periods are used to assess segmentation quality.

This approach consists of three functional modules: object detection, multi-object tracking, and static environment mapping. For object detection, we apply a convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect floating objects represented as oriented bounding boxes. To train the CNN, we propose a method that generates simulated labeled datasets. The detected objects from CNN are tracked with Kalman Filter banks. The remaining LiDAR data points are treated as static environments and represented by polygons. We evaluated the approach by using simulative and real-world datasets. In the simulation, the average precision of the CNN object detector reaches 60.8%, with a data processing rate of 40 Hz in GPU. Our real-world evaluations show that this approach can track 83% of the vessels in a crowded harbor, with the overall intersection over union reaching 64%. Our proposed approach represents the first application of CNN for LiDAR-based maritime environment perception, demonstrating its high potential for future online and real-world applications.","high-traffic areas,real-world applications,static environment mapping,Kalman filters,CNN object detector,automated maritime vehicles,deep-learning-based concept,static environments,Laser radar,neural nets,frequency 40.0 Hz,deep learning,object tracking,automatic identification system,LiDAR detection,Intelligent vessels,supervised learning,maritime navigation,AIS,object detection,sophisticated development,image classification,Radar tracking,Artificial intelligence,convolutional neural network,optical radar,Point cloud compression,Radar,maritime applications,maritime navigation systems,detection range,LiDAR-based maritime environment perception,multi-object tracking,Object detection,deep-learning-based object detection,multiobject tracking,learning (artificial intelligence),remaining LiDAR data points,Detectors,"
"real-time infrared horizon detection in maritime and land environments based on hyper-laplace filter and convolutional neural network","2023","The infrared (IR) horizon is an essential reference for near-ground state awareness and target detection. The traditional horizon detection algorithms based on hand-crafted features claim the advantage of being intuitive and highly targeted, however, their capability of detail extraction and robustness is not strong enough when switching among diverse scenes, meanwhile, the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have the powerful ability in feature acquisition, but has the disadvantages of interpretability and instability. Given this, this article proposes a novel horizon detection algorithm that combines the traditional method and CNN. First, the hyper-Laplace filter (HLF) is proposed to eliminate the interferences and enhance the saliency of the target. Then a positioning module (PM) based on the traditional idea which fully utilizes the structural characteristics of multifeature-maps in CNN is present to extract the endpoints of the horizon. Finally, an auxiliary module that consists of a revise branch (RB) and self-attention module (SAM) is designed to assist the PM with detailed corrections. Compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms, experiments based on three datasets with more than 25000 frames under various scenes demonstrate that the proposed algorithm not only achieves the best accuracy and highest stability but also addresses real-time needs. Notably, the detection deviation is controlled within 2 pixels on all three datasets while achieving a comparable detection speed of 170 frames/s. Besides, our algorithm also shows strong robustness even under harsh sea conditions and urban backgrounds.

"a deep semantic autoencoder for maritime wireless communications","2023","With the rapid development of maritime transportation, ocean tourism, monitoring, surveillance and aquaculture, the maritime communication industry has encountered new opportunities. Maritime End-to-end (E2E) communication systems based on deep learning (DL) have become diverse, while semantic communication systems have become a critical research point due to their ability to understand and analyze natural language. In this paper, we propose a deep semantic autoencoder (DSA) for maritime wireless communications. The DSA consists of a semantic encoder, channel encoder, channel decoder, and semantic decoder. The DSA employs transformers and convolutional neural networks to extract and restore the meaning of sentences while minimizing semantic errors during transmission. In order to enhance the effectiveness of the DSA in transmitting maritime data, the Rician fading channel is utilized to simulate complex and varied marine environments. Furthermore, the system parameters of the DSA are optimized through training the maritime data and calculating the loss functions.

"fault detection with lstm-based variational autoencoder for maritime components","2021","Maintenance routines on ships today follow either a reactive maintenance (RM) or preventive maintenance (PvM) approach. RM can be regarded as post-failure repair, which might create large costs. PvM uses predetermined maintenance intervals, which often involves unnecessary maintenance. Recently, prognostics and health management (PHM) has emerged as a potential way to develop an ideal maintenance policy. PHM aims to provide optimal maintenance schedule through the use of sensor measurement for fault detection and fault prognostics, among which fault detection is the first and fundamental action. In this paper, a long-short term memory based variational autoencoder (LSTM-VAE) is proposed for fault detection of maritime components onboard. It is a semi-supervised approach that requires only fault-free data for training. Therefore, it is widely applicable in the maritime industry since operational data in normal conditions already exists. Real-world operation data collected from a diesel engine on the research vessel (RV) Gunnerus is used to validate the method.

"detection of invalid ais messages using machine learning techniques","2022","Coastal nations monitor maritime activities in the interest of defence, security, and safety. This form of monitoring typically occurs at operations centers that visualize the maritime environment by creating a Recognized Maritime Picture (RMP) covering a particular area of interest. The creation of this picture changed drastically with the introduction of the Automatic Identification System (AIS). AIS messages are known to contain numerous types of errors and in April 2020 a unique error was found in the data stream. This error consisted of messages indicating the appearance of over 200 vessels in the North Atlantic taking part in a yacht race when in fact no race or physical ships existed. The following work explores the application of various machine learning (ML) techniques to help identify these types of fabricated AIS messages. Specific ML techniques were explored including: K-means clustering, Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Feed-Forward Neural Networks (FNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and One-Class Support Vector Machines (One-SVM). The results showed that DT, RF, and FNN best identified the fabricated AIS messages with F1 scores greater than 93 percent on the test data.","maritime domain awareness,AIS,automatic identification system,machine learning,"
"adaptive detection tracking system for autonomous uav maritime patrolling","2020","Nowadays, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are considered reliable systems, suitable for several autonomous applications, especially for target detection and tracking. Although significant developments were achieved in object detection systems over the last decades using the deep learning technique known as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), there are still research gaps in this area. In this paper, we present a new object detection-tracking algorithm that can be used on low power consuming processing boards. In particular, we analysed a specific application scenario in which a UAV patrols coastlines and autonomously classifies different kind of marine objects. Current state of the art solutions propose centralised architectures or flying systems with human in the loop, making the whole system poorly efficient and not scalable. On the contrary, applying a Deep Learning detection system that runs on commercial Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) makes UAVs potentially more efficient than humans (especially for dull tasks like coastline patrolling) and the whole system becomes easily scalable because each UAV can fly independently and the Ground Control Station does not represent a bottleneck. To deal with this task, a database consisting of more than 115000 images was created to train and test several CNN architectures. Furthermore, an adaptive detection-tracking algorithm was introduced to make the whole system faster by optimizing the balancing between detecting new objects and tracking existing targets. The proposed solution is based on the measure of the tracking confidence and the frame similarity, by means of the Structural SIMilarity (SSIM) index, computed both globally and locally.

"location estimation in a maritime environment using a monocular camera","2014","Maritime surveillance is a very important task in coastal areas, especially in harbour environments. The most popular such systems include components like Automatic Identification System (AIS) and Radar. Camera based visual surveillance can be used as an alternative to these systems in order to overcome the lacking features of them. Sea surface object detection and identification is a major need for such visual surveillance systems. Most of the current visual surveillance systems don't have the ability of identifying vessels in real time. A vessel can be identified using information from other systems, if the location of the vessel is identified. Location estimation of sea surface objects is mainly explored in this research. Video stream from a single geo stationary camera is used as the input; however camera properties are not used for any calculation. Mainly two distance measurements are considered and different approaches for estimating the distances are explored. Neural network approach gave considerably accurate results in vertical distance estimation and it was found that the shortest distance from camera to the object can be measured best using B-spline 3D curve fitting. Data taken from AIS is used for fitting curves and training neural network. After calculating distances, latitudes and longitudes are calculated.

"a multi-task learning-based framework for global maritime trajectory and destination prediction with ais data","2022","Automatic Identification System (AIS) was initially developed for tracking ships and avoiding collisions. As numerous small satellites were launched in recent years, millions of AIS messages are captured by these satellite AIS providers every day. The massive amount of data allow shipping firms and port operators to better predict vessels’ movement. In this study, a computational framework is developed to predict future trajectories and destinations of vessels by applying deep learning to the satellite AIS messages containing self-reporting positioning data. We employed deep learning approaches for large-scale maritime prediction and identifies the most suitable deep neural networks for this specific application. Three prediction models, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Dense Neural Networks (DNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) have been tested in the framework. A multi-task learning architecture is implemented based on test results. Through sharing parameters while training, this architecture enables long-term destination predictions by balancing short-term trajectory predictions.

At first stage, Mask R-CNN framework is trained with custom built bollard. The model obtained from the training is inferred with real data resulting in instance segment of bollard. The segmented mask obtained contains relatively large amount of the data points representing the whole area of bollard, which typically is not desirable. In order to precisely localize the bollard with one reference co-ordinate, the proposed algorithm is applied to segmented mask. Firstly, it translates the segmented mask to only four co-ordinate points, where each point correspond to the edge of bollard. Further, from the edges, the reference point is estimated.

A combination network consisting of a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract spatial features and a long short-term memory (LSTM) for extracting temporal patterns in the spatial features is proposed. The network augments the detector structure by blanking out regions of the frame which are classified as not containing a target, thus reducing false alarms. The network is tested on data containing four marine targets collected by a ground-based radar. The data set was chosen because it contains strong sea clutter returns. When ML is used, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves are shifted to lower probability of false alarm (PFA). A Kalman filter tracker was applied to the ML-augmented and baseline detections, and it was shown that ML-augmented detections produced similar tracks at lower PFA.

"eprd: exploiting prior knowledge for evidence-providing automatic rumor detection","2023","With the prevalence of social media platforms, rumors have been a serious social problem. Notably, existing rumor detection methods simply provide detection labels while ignoring their explanation. However, illustrating the reasons why a suspicious statement is a rumor is essential. To address this realistic scenario, we propose a novel Evidence-Providing Rumor Detection model called EPRD. EPRD incorporates a wide variety of information from both prior knowledge sources and current comments. It also learns bilaterally friendly representations for interpretable rumor detection. EPRD first retrieves evidence from prior knowledge sources and checks the relationship between the given statement and its evidence. Our model then constructs two heterogeneous graph objects to simulate the propagation layout of the current comments and evidence relationships. Finally, EPRD integrates the GraphSAGE component and attention mechanism to detect rumors. To the best of our knowledge, we propose the first model that incorporates prior knowledge to verify rumors and boost credibility. Experiments on two real-world Twitter datasets demonstrate that EPRD consistently exhibits the best rumor detection performance. Moreover, EPRD outperforms other baselines in the early rumor detection task.","Deep learning,Graph neural network,Rumor detection,Evidence,Natural language inference,"
"an adaptive threshold fast dbscan algorithm with preserved trajectory feature points for vessel trajectory clustering","2023","Vessel navigation pattern recognition plays an important role in the research of intelligent transportation on water. Clustering using the data stored in The Automatic Identification System (AIS) is a current research hotspot. However, there are three problems in the past clustering analysis. First, the traditional Douglas-Peucker (DP) Compression Algorithm exists feature point loss and trajectory distortion when compressing trajectories. Second, Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm require high time cost. Finally, most of the studies ignore the interaction between parameters when choosing the parameters of DBSCAN. These problems seriously affect the efficiency and accuracy of clustering. To solve these problems, this paper improves the existing methods by (1) Adaptive selection of compression thresholds and trajectory feature points for each trajectory when using the DP algorithm ensures the realism of the compressed trajectory; (2) using the Fast-DTW algorithm to improve the computation speed and ensure the accuracy of trajectory similarity; (3) Self-selection of parameter combinations based on Silhouette Coefficient (SC) scores was achieved using the similarity distribution of the trajectories in combination with an improved K-Adaptive Nearest Neighbors (KANN). The experiments show that the proposed method can greatly reduce the time cost of clustering compared to the original method and significantly outperforms the three compared algorithms in terms of clustering effect images.","Fast-DTW,Ship trajectory clustering,AF-DP,DBSCAN,Navigation pattern recognition,"
"maritime target detection based on radar graph data and graph convolutional network","2022","Due to the complex sea clutter environment and target features, the conventional statistical theory-based methods cannot achieve high performance in maritime target detection tasks. Conventional deep learning, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs)-based target detection methods process each signal sample independently, and the temporal-spatial domain correlation information is seldom used. To achieve full utilization of information contained in radar signals and improve the detection performance, a graph convolutional network (GCN) is considered, which has shown great advantages in graph data processing and has been applied in the field of signal processing. This letter proposed a maritime target detection method based on radar signal graph data and graph convolution. Graph structure data is applied to define the detection units and to represent the temporal and spatial information of detection units. The target detection of the signal corresponding to the nodes is conducted via GCN. Experimental results show that the proposed approach can effectively detect marine targets when the signal-to-noise ratio is above âˆ’5 dB and can effectively suppress false alarms in the pure clutter area, which is not adjacent to targets.

"maritime radar target detection in sea clutter based on cnn with dual-perspective attention","2023","Radar-based maritime target detection plays an important role in ocean monitoring. Considering the practical application, pulse-compression radar is widely used in terms of civilian offshore surface target detection. The existence of sea clutter will greatly interfere the detection performance of pulse-compression radar. This leads to the low detection performance of traditional algorithms like constant false alarm rate (CFAR). Deep learning methods have made strides in many fields recently, such as natural language processing and speech recognition. Inspired by this idea, we propose a maritime radar target detection method in sea clutter based on convolution neural network (CNN) and dual-perspective attention (DPA). The proposed method first encodes the radar echo in high-dimensional space and then extracts the correlation features from the global and local perspectives through the attention mechanism. We deployed the X-band pulse-compression radar on the coast of Hainan, China, and collected a lot of measured data.

It can be used for monitoring the marine environment, maritime traffic, and oil spills at sea. SAR provides accurate and real-time ocean information, which can ensure water traffic safety and ecological environment. Therefore, it plays an irreplaceable role in maritime surveillance. At present, deep-learning based object detection methods have achieved certain results in the application of ship detection in SAR images. Ship targets in SAR images have strong angular reflection characteristics, causing some parts of them to have large grayscale values, appearing as scattering points. At the same time, the heading of ship usually has a certain angle with the horizontal direction. Traditional deep-learning models do not have sufficient generalization ability for these situations. Horizontal bounding boxes also contain a large amount of background features, which affects the accuracy of the model. In response to these characteristics, first use convolutional neural network to extract ship features; Secondly, generate oriented proposals to reduce the impact of background features; Thirdly, using Canny and Harris to obtain features of ship edges and scattering points as attention mechanisms to enhance bounding box regression and classification; Finally, optimize the loss function, which will consider the influence of angle.

"asynchronous trajectory matching-based multimodal maritime data fusion for vessel traffic surveillance in inland waterways","2023","The automatic identification system (AIS) and video cameras have been widely exploited for vessel traffic surveillance in inland waterways. The AIS data could provide vessel identity and dynamic information on vessel position and movements. In contrast, the video data could describe the visual appearances of moving vessels without knowing the information on identity, position, movements, etc. To further improve vessel traffic surveillance, it becomes necessary to fuse the AIS and video data to simultaneously capture the visual features, identity, and dynamic information for the vessels of interest. However, the performance of AIS and video data fusion is susceptible to issues such as data spatial difference, message asynchronous transmission, visual object occlusion, etc. In this work, we propose a deep learning-based simple online and real-time vessel data fusion method (termed DeepSORVF). We first extract the AIS-and video-based vessel trajectories, and then propose an asynchronous trajectory matching method to fuse the AIS-based vessel information with the corresponding visual targets. In addition, by combining the AIS-and video-based movement features, we also present a prior knowledge-driven anti-occlusion method to yield accurate and robust vessel tracking results under occlusion conditions. To validate the efficacy of our DeepSORVF, we have also constructed a new benchmark dataset (termed FVessel) for vessel detection, tracking, and data fusion. It consists of many videos and the corresponding AIS data collected in various weather conditions and locations. The experimental results have demonstrated that our method is capable of guaranteeing high-reliable data fusion and anti-occlusion vessel tracking.

"ais data-driven ship trajectory prediction modelling and analysis based on machine learning and deep learning methods","2023","Maritime transport faces new safety challenges in an increasingly complex traffic environment caused by large-scale and high-speed ships, particularly with the introduction of intelligent and autonomous ships. It is evident that Automatic Identification System (AIS) data-driven ship trajectory prediction can effectively aid in identifying abnormal ship behaviours and reducing maritime risks such as collision, stranding, and contact. Furthermore, trajectory prediction is widely recognised as one of the critical technologies for realising safe autonomous navigation. The prediction methods and their performance are the key factors for future safe and automatic shipping. Currently, ship trajectory prediction lacks the real performance measurement and analysis of different algorithms, including classical machine learning and emerging deep learning methods. This paper aims to systematically analyse the performance of ship trajectory prediction methods and pioneer experimental tests to reveal their advantages and disadvantages as well as fitness in different scenarios involving complicated systems. To do so, five machine learning methods (i.e., Kalman Filter (KF), Support Vector Progression (SVR), Back Propagation network (BP), Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), and Random Forest (RF)) and seven deep learning methods (i.e., Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gate Recurrent Unit (GRU), Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM), Sequence to Sequence (Seq2seq), Bi-directional Gate Recurrent Unit (Bi-GRU), and Transformer) are first extracted from the state-of-the-art literature review and then employed to implement the trajectory prediction and compare their prediction performance in the real world. Three AIS datasets are collected from the waters of representative traffic features, including a normal channel (i.e., the Chengshan Jiao Promontory), complex traffic (i.e., the Zhoushan Archipelago), and a port area (i.e., Caofeidian port). They are selected to test and analyse the performance of all twelve methods based on six evaluation indexes and explore the characteristics and effectiveness of the twelve trajectory prediction methods in detail. The experimental results provide a novel perspective, comparison, and benchmark for ship trajectory prediction research, which not only demonstrates the fitness of each method in different maritime traffic scenarios, but also makes significant contributions to maritime safety and autonomous shipping development.","Deep learning,Maritime safety,Trajectory prediction,AIS data,Machine learning,"

The constantly refined models, resulting from concurrent incremental learning, are used to evaluate the behavior patterns of vessels based on their present motion states. Improvement to the associative learning law for learning temporal associations between vessel events enables conditional probabilities between events to be learned incrementally and locally. This allows weights in the learned model to be interpreted more readily, enabling better location prediction performance. Improvement in prediction performance is achieved by using multiple spatial scales to represent position, enabling the most relevant spatial scale to be used for local vessel behavior.

These ground-breaking techniques have promoted the rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT) in maritime industries. In maritime IoT applications, intelligent vessel traffic services can be guaranteed by collecting and analyzing high volume of spatial data flows from automatic identification system (AIS). This AIS system includes a highly integrated automatic equipment, including functionalities of core communication, tracking, and sensing. The increased utilization of shipboard AIS devices allows the collection of massive trajectory data. However, the received raw AIS data often suffers from undesirable outliers (i.e., poorly tracked timestamped points for vessel trajectories) during signal acquisition and analog-to-digital conversion. The degraded AIS data will bring negative effects on vessel traffic services (e.g., maritime traffic monitoring, intelligent maritime navigation, vessel collision avoidance, etc.) in maritime IoT scenarios. To improve the quality of vessel trajectory records from AIS networks, we propose to develop a two-phase data-driven machine learning framework for vessel trajectory reconstruction. In particular, a density-based clustering method is introduced in the first phase to automatically recognize the undesirable outliers. The second phase proposes a bidirectional long short-term memory (BLSTM)-based supervised learning technique to restore the timestamped points degraded by random outliers in vessel trajectories. Comprehensive experiments on simulated and realistic data sets have verified the dominance of our two-phase vessel reconstruction framework compared to other competing methods.

"anomaly based sea-surface small target detection using k-nearest neighbor classification","2020","Sea-surface small target detection is always a difficult problem in high-resolution maritime ubiquitous radars for complex characteristics of sea clutter, weak target returns, and diversity of targets. Multiple features extracted from radar returns in different domains have ability but not enough to solely distinguish radar returns with target from sea clutter. Joint exploitation of multiple features becomes the key to improve detection performance. In this article, the K-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm and anomaly detection idea are cooperated to develop a novel sea-surface target detection method in the feature space spanned by the eight existing salient features. The detection is realized by the anomaly detection followed by a specially designed KNN-based classifier with a controllable false alarm rate. In the anomaly detection, a decision region is determined by the hyper-spherical coverage of the training set of sea clutter that is sufficient and ergodic in the feature space. The KNN-based classifier is designed based on the training sample set of sea clutter and the training sample set of simulated target returns plus sea clutter that is sufficient but nonergodic, by joint usage of feature weighting, neighbor weighting, and distance weighting. The novel method is validated by the two open and recognized IPIX and CSIR radar databases for sea-surface small target detection.

The low-frequency components can be easily predicted directly through traditional neural network (NN) methods. It is more difficult to predict high-frequency components due to their properties of weak mathematical regularity. To take advantage of the inherent self-similarities within high-frequency components, these components will be divided into several continuous small (overlapping) segments. The grouped segments with high similarities are then selected to form more proper training datasets for traditional NN methods. This regrouping strategy can assist in enhancing the prediction accuracy of high-frequency components. The final prediction result is obtained by integrating the predicted high- and low-frequency components.

"intelligent edge-enabled efficient multi-source data fusion for autonomous surface vehicles in maritime internet of things","2022","With the rapid development of low-end Internet of Things (IoT) devices and shipborne sensors, efficient multi-source data fusion methods for autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) have recently attracted significant research interest in intelligent edge-enabled maritime applications. The data fusion capacity can enhance the situation awareness of ASVs, leading to improved efficacy and safety in ASV-empowered maritime IoT (MIoT). Both cameras and automatic identification system (AIS) equipment, which provide visual and positioning information, respectively, have become the commonly adopted cost-effective sensors. In this work, we first introduce a lightweight YOLOX-s network with transfer learning to accurately and robustly detect the moving vessels at different scales in real time. A data augmentation method is then proposed to promote its generalization ability. The detected vessels and synchronous AIS messages are finally fused to make full use of the multi-source sensing data, contributing to an augmented reality (AR)-based maritime navigation system at the shipborne intelligent edges. The AR system is able to superimpose both static and dynamic information from the collected AIS messages onto the video-captured images. It has the capacity of providing auxiliary information for early warning of navigation risks for ASVs in MIoT networks. Compared with traditional single-sensor-based navigation methods, our data fusion framework exhibits more reliable and robust results, and appears to have substantial practical potential applications. Extensive experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the superior performance of our framework under different navigational conditions.","collected AIS messages,shipborne intelligent edges,intelligent edge-enabled efficient multisource data fusion,intelligent edge-enabled maritime applications,augmented reality,deep neural network,sensor fusion,augmented reality-based maritime navigation system,Safety,multi-source data fusion,remotely operated vehicles,Internet of Things,Cameras,low-end Internet,detected vessels,improved efficacy,Laser radar,synchronous AIS messages,maritime Internet,Autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs),safety,data fusion capacity,multisource sensing data,data augmentation method,image fusion,marine safety,cameras,efficient multisource data fusion methods,edge computing,shipborne sensors,traditional single-sensor-based navigation methods,autonomous surface vehicles,Artificial intelligence,commonly adopted cost-effective sensors,Radar,data fusion framework exhibits,ASV-empowered maritime IoT,ASVs,Data integration,mobile robots,maritime Internet of Things (MIoT),navigation,learning (artificial intelligence),Intelligent sensors,Things devices,"
"the usefulness of artificial intelligence for safety assessment of different transport modes","2023","Recent research in transport safety focuses on the processing of large amounts of available data by means of intelligent systems, in order to decrease the number of accidents for transportation users. Several Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications have been developed to address safety problems and improve efficiency of transportation systems. However exchange of knowledge between transport modes has been limited. This paper reviews the ML and AI methods used in different transport modes (road, rail, maritime and aviation) to address safety problems, in order to identify good practices and experiences that can be transferable between transport modes. The methods examined include statistical and econometric methods, algorithmic approaches, classification and clustering methods, artificial neural networks (ANN) as well as optimization and dimension reduction techniques. Our research reveals the increasing interest of transportation researchers and practitioners in AI applications for crash prediction, incident/failure detection, pattern identification, driver/operator or route assistance, as well as optimization problems. The most popular and efficient methods used in all transport modes are ANN, SVM, Hidden Markov Models and Bayesian models. The type of the analytical technique is mainly driven by the purpose of the safety analysis performed. Finally, a wider variety of AI and ML methodologies is observed in road transport mode, which also appears to concentrate a higher, and constantly increasing, number of studies compared to the other modes.","Machine Learning,Transportation Modes,Transportation Safety,Artificial Intelligence,"

"a contextual hybrid model for vessel movement prediction","2021","Predicting the movement of the vessels can significantly improve the management of safety. While the movement can be a function of geographic contexts, the current systems and methods rarely incorporate contextual information into the analysis. This paper initially proposes a novel context-aware trajectoriesâ€™ simplification method to embed the effects of geographic context which guarantees the logical consistency of the compressed trajectories, and further suggests a hybrid method that is built upon a curvilinear model and deep neural networks. The proposed method employs contextual information to check the logical consistency of the curvilinear method and then, constructs a Context-aware Long Short-Term Memory (CLSTM) network that can take into account contextual variables, such as the vessel types. The proposed method can enhance the prediction accuracy while maintaining the logical consistency, through a recursive feedback loop. The implementations of the proposed approach on the Automatic Identification System (AIS) dataset, from the eastern coast of the United States of America which was collected, from November to December 2017, demonstrates the effectiveness and better compression, i.e. 80% compression ratio while maintaining the logical consistency. The estimated compressed trajectories are 23% more similar to their original trajectories compared to currently used simplification methods. Furthermore, the overall accuracy of the implemented hybrid method is 15.68% higher than the ordinary Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network which is currently used by various maritime systems and applications, including collision avoidance, vessel route planning, and anomaly detection systems.","recurrent neural nets,Safety,deep learning (artificial intelligence),Mathematical model,safety management,movement prediction,AIS dataset,Predictive models,curvilinear method,ubiquitous computing,deep neural networks,CLSTM network,ship behavior,deep learning,ships,automatic identification system dataset,marine safety,marine engineering,Data models,contextual hybrid model,contextual information,vessel movement prediction,United States of America,geographic context,data compression,Automatic identification system,vessel types,Trajectory,compressed trajectory estimation,context-aware LSTM network,vessel route planning,Deep learning,Context modeling,context-aware long short-term memory network,logical consistency,context-aware trajectories simplification,"
"maritime ship detection using convolutional neural networks from satellite images","2021","The significance of efficient monitoring and control of marine traffic for the purpose of safety and security of the ships cannot be overemphasized in the current scenario where global trade and commerce is at its pinnacle.

"data-driven fraud detection in international shipping","2018","Document fraud constitutes a growing problem in international shipping. Shipping documentation may be deliberately manipulated to avoid shipping restrictions or customs duties. Well-known examples of such fraud are miscoding and smuggling. These are cases in which the documentation of a shipment does not correctly or entirely describe the goods in transit. In an attempt to reduce the risks of document fraud, shipping companies and customs authorities typically perform random audits to check the accompanying documentation of shipments. Although these audits detect many fraud schemes, they are quite labor intensive and do not scale to the massive amounts of cargo that is shipped each day. This paper investigates whether intelligent fraud detection systems can improve the detection of miscoding and smuggling by analyzing large sets of historical shipment data. We develop a Bayesian network that predicts the presence of goods on the cargo list of shipments. The predictions of the Bayesian network are compared with the accompanying documentation of a shipment to determine whether document fraud is perpetrated. We also show how a set of discriminative models can be derived from the topology of the Bayesian network and perform the same fraud detection task. Our experimental results show that intelligent fraud detection systems can considerably improve the detection of miscoding and smuggling compared to random audits.","Neural networks,International shipping,Fraud detection,Logistic regression,Bayesian networks,Probablistic classification,"
"sensorized buoy for oil spill early detection","2016","The Sea is often a fragile environment to be protected against possible pollutants. In this context, the present work contributes to its safeguard by proposing a new buoy equipped with advanced sensors for the detection of oil spills. In particular, the buoy is provided with various sensors for the evaluation of both meteorological and marine parameters (e.g. waves, wind, temperature), and chemical/physical data acquired by an electronic nose system specifically designed for the detection of hydrocarbons. The electronic nose is composed of a flow chamber, a chamber equipped with photo ionization sensors, pumps and valves for air inlet and outlet, and a low-cost electronic board. The designed system samples the air above the water and produces data that are processed through two artificial neural networks allowing for a classification of detected hydrocarbons and overall pollution level. Suitable network interfaces and a connector toward a Marine Information System (MIS) allow both for real-time data visualization and for long-term assessment of water quality.","Oil spills,Marine pollution,Hydrocarbons classification,Sensorized buoy,Electronic noses,"
"surveillance in maritime scenario using deep learning and swarm intelligence","2022","Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have played a crucial role in supporting Search and Rescue (SAR) Operations due to their fast movement capabilities and flexibility. During a search and rescue operation scenario, the time constraint is a crucial parameter, so the required time to detect humans in distress with precision is also a vital part. Modern Deep learning algorithms like CNN also aid in these missions. However, most models and datasets available focus on search and rescue missions on the ground or land. UAV-based search and rescue operations in the Maritime Scenario remain a challenge. This study focused on using deep learning algorithms such as CNN to precisely detect a human in peril with a swarm of drones. At the same time, we emphasize using swarm intelligence algorithms such as Particle Swarm Algorithm (PSO) to effectively find a victim in the shortest time by exploring a massive area. The distinctiveness of this system is that it combines the model with the best accuracy to detect and the best swarm intelligence algorithm for finding targets in the quickest time possible, thus enhancing the surveillance mission.

However, most of the existing tracking methods belong to generative models, which only focus on the features of the object and require the target has significant visual saliency for accurate tracking.

In this paper, a deep learning based tracking method is proposed to track maritime ships, namely, SiamFPN. In SiamFPN, a modified Siamese Network is combined with multi-RPNs to build a tracking pipeline. Concretely, A ResNet-50 with an FPN structure is used as the CNN of the detection subnetwork of Siamese, and a template subnetwork is parallel to the detection. In order to strengthen the discriminative ability, three RPNs are deployed to process the output of Siamese Network.

"wasrâ€”a water segmentation and refinement maritime obstacle detection network","2022","Obstacle detection using semantic segmentation has become an established approach in autonomous vehicles. However, existing segmentation methods, primarily developed for ground vehicles, are inadequate in an aquatic environment as they produce many false positive (FP) detections in the presence of water reflections and wakes.

A deep encoder based on ResNet101 with atrous convolutions enables the extraction of rich visual features, while a novel decoder gradually fuses them with inertial information from the inertial measurement unit (IMU). The inertial information greatly improves the segmentation accuracy of the water component in the presence of visual ambiguities, such as fog on the horizon. Furthermore, a novel loss function for semantic separation is proposed to enforce the separation of different semantic components to increase the robustness of the segmentation. We investigate different loss variants and observe a significant reduction in FPs and an increase in true positives (TPs). Experimental results show that WaSR outperforms the current state of the art by approximately 4% in F1 score on a challenging unmanned surface vehicle dataset.

Future applications might include detection of fraudulent self-declarations of types, e.g., during illegal fishing activities.","surveillance,maritime surveillances systems,Fuzzy Rule,Nearest Neighbor,maritime vessels,Neural networks,Data Science,experimental comparison,Decision Tree,Decision trees,Neural Network,ad hoc methods,real-life AIS data,ships,marine safety,marine engineering,Automatic Identification System,AIS,Ions,pattern classification,NaÃ¯ve Bayes,Artificial intelligence,navigational data,maritime surveillance systems,Training,maritime hotspots,VHF radio propagation,KNIME Analytics Platform,VHF-radio data exchange,radio data systems,Surveillance,Classification,accuracy,Task analysis,performance evaluation,maritime safety,"
"automated monitoring in maritime video surveillance system","2020","Maritime surveillance for intruders/illegal activities requires monitoring of a large area of the coastline. This task being manually exhaustive, would benefit immensely by application of object detection techniques to surveillance videos. However, object detection models trained on general objects datasets cannot be expected to give best performance for this scenario as marine vessels are only a small subset of these huge datasets and also do not classify the specific type of sea vehicle. Hence, their benchmarks are not appropriate for maritime surveillance. Some studies have been done with applications of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for ship/boat detection on private and publicly available sea vessels datasets. This paper presents a summary of the benchmarks so far and presents our experiments of the latest object detection techniques for combined marine vessels dataset. A survey of the currently available datasets is also given. Results of our experiments in terms of mean Average Precision (mAP) and Frames Per Second (FPS) are presented.","Benchmark testing,object detection models,surveillance videos,sea vehicle,computerised monitoring,Meteorology,Videos,ships,marine engineering,Marine vessel identification,boats,object detection,Intruder detection,Video surveillance,convolutional neural nets,convolutional neural networks,general objects datasets,private sea vessels datasets,automated monitoring,Ship detection,Deep learning,Object detection,Computational modeling,Task analysis,video surveillance,marine vessels dataset,maritime video surveillance,"
"leveraging graph and deep learning uncertainties to detect anomalous maritime trajectories","2022","Understanding and representing traffic patterns are key to detecting anomalous trajectories in the transportation domain. However, some trajectories can exhibit heterogeneous maneuvering characteristics despite confining to normal patterns. Thus, we propose a novel graph-based trajectory representation and association scheme for extraction and confederation of traffic movement patterns, such that data patterns and uncertainty can be learned by deep learning (DL) models. This paper proposes the usage of a recurrent neural network (RNN)-based evidential regression model, which can predict trajectory at future timesteps as well as estimate the data and model uncertainties associated, to detect anomalous maritime trajectories, such as unusual vessel maneuvering, using automatic identification system (AIS) data. Furthermore, we utilize evidential deep learning classifiers to detect unusual turns of vessels and the loss of transmitted signal using predicted class probabilities with associated uncertainties. Our experimental results suggest that the graphical representation of traffic patterns improves the ability of the DL models, such as evidential and Monte Carlo dropout, to learn the temporal-spatial correlation of data and associated uncertainties. Using different datasets and experiments, we demonstrate that the estimated prediction uncertainty yields fundamental information for the detection of traffic anomalies in the maritime and, possibly in other domains.","Monte Carlo methods,classification,recurrent neural nets,graph,deep learning (artificial intelligence),Anomaly detection,DL models,graph-based trajectory representation,automatic identification system data,Monte Carlo dropout,graphical representation,traffic movement patterns,detect anomalous maritime trajectories,Predictive models,regression analysis,evidential deep learning,marine engineering,Data models,data patterns,pattern classification,Artificial intelligence,graph theory,RNN,regression,clustering,uncertainty,Trajectory,Uncertainty,probability,Computational modeling,traffic engineering computing,recurrent neural network-based evidential regression model,deep learning uncertainties,AIS data,"
"loitering behavior detection and classification of vessel movements based on trajectory shape and convolutional neural networks","2022","To improve the ability of ship behavior detection in maritime safety surveillance, a new ship behavior of frequent turning within a certain spatial range, called ship loitering, was found under the ship behavior framework of 'anchored-off, straight-sailing, turning'. The concept of trajectory redundancy is defined as the quantitative representation of trajectory characteristics of ship loitering. A multi-scale sliding window-based ship loitering detection method is designed to process ship trajectories with different spatial ranges and time duration. Further, a shape recognition model based on a convolutional neural network is constructed and trained to identify four typical shapes of loitering trajectories. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, experiments were conducted using the AIS trajectory data collected from the sea off the Strait of Juan de Fuca in the eastern North Pacific Ocean in 2017 and validated against the manual labeling results. The results illustrate that six general categories of ships produce loitering behaviors with different intentions. The characteristics of the spatial-temporal distribution of ship loitering behaviors can be represented as different shapes. The average precision of ship loitering detection reaches 96.5% and the average accuracy of four typical loitering trajectory shapes reaches 86.2%.","Convolutional neural network (CNN),Loitering behavior,Ship trajectory,Automatic identification system (AIS),Sliding window,"
"maritime atr using classifier combination and high resolution range profiles","2011","A maritime automatic target recognition system is developed that performs ship classification using one-dimensional high resolution range profiles. Five physically based features are defined and are extracted from both VV and HH polarizations resulting in a 10-dimensional feature vector. A nonlinear classifier combination approach involving a neural network combiner along with three individual classifiers (Bayes, nearest neighbor, and neural network) is proposed. A decision confidence measure based on the classifier discriminants is developed using a nonparametric estimation approach. The confidence measure enables the system to reject samples that have a low decision confidence. The performance of the proposed neural network based combination is compared with individual classifiers and a number of other combination rules. The results show that this combination can provide high recognition accuracy along with a high probability of declaration. The performance in the presence of samples from not-before-seen classes is also investigated. A new nearest neighbor confidence thresholding approach is developed to aid the neural network combiner in rejecting these samples.","Automatic test equipment,classifier discriminant,polarization,Bayes classifier,marine radar,Bayes methods,Marine vehicles,Feature extraction,nonlinear classifier combination approach,decision confidence measure,ships,nearest neighbor classifier,marine engineering,neural network classifier,Target tracking,radar target recognition,synthetic aperture radar,pattern classification,search radar,feature vector,Classification algorithms,nonparametric estimation approach,maritime automatic target recognition system,decision theory,nearest neighbor confidence thresholding approach,vectors,maritime surveillance radar,neural network combiner,high resolution range profiles,radar resolution,ship classification,polarisation,inverse synthetic aperture radar,Radar detection,"
