"maritime situation analysis: a multi-vessel interaction and anomaly detection framework","2014","Maritime security is critical for protecting sea lanes, ports, harborsand other critical infrastructure against a broad range of threats and illegal activities like smuggling, human trafficking, piracy and terrorism. Limited resources constrain maritime domain awareness and compromise full security coverage at all times. This situation calls for innovative intelligent systems for interactive situation analysis to assist marine authorities and security personal in their routine surveillance operations. In this paper, we propose a novel situation analysis approach to analyze, detect and differentiate a range of interaction patterns and anomalies of interest for marine vessels that operate over some period of time in relative proximity to each other. We analyze vessel interaction scenarios to model common patterns as probabilistic processes in terms of hidden Markov models. To differentiate suspicious activities from unobjectionable behavior, we explore fusion of data and information from observable behavior (geospatial aspects, kinematic features and contextual information) and maritime domain knowledge from diverse sources. Our experimental evaluation using real-world vessel tracking data shows the effectiveness of the approach.","Kinematics,anomaly detection framework,Interactive Situation Analysis,hidden Markov models,sensor fusion,intelligent systems,Hidden Markov models,Maritime Safety & Security,Marine vehicles,Anomaly Detection,Decision Support,Feature extraction,data fusion,security of data,maritime security,geospatial aspects,sea lanes,military computing,kinematic features,contextual information,interaction patterns,hidden Markov model,multivessel interaction,maritime situation analysis,Trajectory,Cognition,ports,harbors,Intelligent Systems,Security,"
"anomalous behavior detection of marine vessels based on hidden markov model","2018","In recent years, marine traffic has increased dramatically. Therefore, some vessels may show abnormal behaviors which may indicate different dangers or threats, and also decreases the marine security. These abnormal behaviors are called anomalies. Automatic detection of anomalies is one of the current issues in the maritime domain. Similar works have been proposed that often used parameters speed and location to detect anomalies, and also high false alarm rate is one of the main problems of those. In this paper, a novel approach to maritime vessels anomalous behavior detection based on Hidden Markov Model with the use of parameters speed, location and course have been proposed to increase the situational awareness. Implementation results of the proposed method represent low false alarm rate and more than 96% accuracy in the classification of normal behavior from anomalous behaviors.","automatic anomaly detection,hidden Markov models,Hidden Markov models,Support vector machines,Anomaly detection,marine security,Anomaly Detection,security of data,low false alarm rate,marine safety,marine vessels,marine engineering,Biological system modeling,Maritime Surveillance,abnormal behaviors,Data models,parameters speed,maritime domain,situational awareness,marine traffic,Situational Awareness,maritime vessels anomalous behavior detection,Trajectory,Hidden Markov Model,Surveillance,high false alarm rate,"
"vessel track information mining using ais data","2014","In recent years, vessel traffic and maritime situation awareness become more and more important for countries across the world. AIS data contains much information about vessel motion and reflects traffic characteristics. In this paper, data mining is introduced to discover motion patterns of vessel movements. Firstly, we do statistical analysis for large scale of AIS data. Secondly, we use association rules to analyze the frequent moving status of vessels. We extend the dimensions of data features, improve the algorithm in efficiency and import the concept of time scale in the algorithm based on the previous relative work. Thirdly, we introduce Markov model to make supplement for the association rules. The prediction results in the Markov process are further used to do the anomaly detection. The method in this paper provides novel idea for the research in AIS data and the management of maritime traffic.","Markov processes,data mining,Clustering algorithms,Association rules,vessel movements,Hidden Markov models,anomaly detection,Marine vehicles,Markov model,vessel traffic,maritime traffic management,statistical analysis,motion patterns,association rules,Data models,Markov,traffic information systems,vessel track information mining,traffic characteristics,maritime situation awareness,frequent moving status,vessel motion,marine vehicles,AIS data,"
"maritime anomaly detection and threat assessment","2010","Ships involved in commercial activities tend to follow set patterns of behaviour depending on the business in which they are engaged. If a ship exhibits anomalous behaviour, this could indicate it is being used for illicit activities. With the wide availability of automatic identification system (AIS) data it is now possible to detect some of these patterns of behaviour. Monitoring the possible threat posed by the worldwide movement of ships, however, requires efficient and robust automatic data processing to create a priority list for further investigation. This paper outlines five anomalous ship behaviours: deviation from standard routes, unexpected AIS activity, unexpected port arrival, close approach, and zone entry. For each behaviour, a process is described for determining the probability that it is anomalous. Individual probabilities are combined using a Bayesian network to calculate the overall probability that a specific threat is present. Examples of how the algorithms work are given using simulated and real data.","Markov processes,white shipping,anomalous ship behaviour,Hidden Markov models,Automatic identification system (AIS),anomaly detection,Bayes methods,Marine vehicles,belief networks,Sea measurements,robust automatic data processing,unexpected port arrival,threat assessment,automatic identification system,marine engineering,Biological system modeling,individual probability,anomalous behaviour,situational awareness,maritime anomaly detection,Tracking,maritime environment,Bayesian network,Probability,AIS activity,security,"
"maritime situation analysis framework: vessel interaction classification and anomaly detection","2015","Maritime domain awareness is critical for protecting sea lanes, ports, harbors, offshore structures like oil and gas rigs and other types of critical infrastructure against common threats and illegal activities. Typical examples range from smuggling of drugs and weapons, human trafficking and piracy all the way to terror attacks. Limited surveillance resources constrain maritime domain awareness and compromise full security coverage at all times. This situation calls for innovative intelligent systems for interactive situation analysis to assist marine authorities and security personal in their routine surveillance operations. In this article, we propose a novel situation analysis approach to analyze marine traffic data and differentiate various scenarios of vessel engagement for the purpose of detecting anomalies of interest for marine vessels that operate over some period of time in relative proximity to each other. We consider such scenarios as probabilistic processes and analyze complex vessel trajectories using machine learning to model common patterns. Specifically, we represent patterns as left-to-right Hidden Markov Models and classify them using Support Vector Machines. To differentiate suspicious activities from unobjectionable behavior, we explore fusion of data and information, including kinematic features, geospatial features, contextual information and maritime domain knowledge. Our experimental evaluation shows the effectiveness of the proposed approach using comprehensive real-world vessel tracking data from coastal waters of North America.","Kinematics,surveillance,hidden Markov models,interactive situation analysis,Hidden Markov models,Geospatial analysis,anomaly detection,Anomaly Detection,maritime domain awareness,marine traffic data analysis,data fusion,information fusion,data analysis,Maritime Domain Awareness,vessel engagement,routine surveillance operations,marine engineering,support vector machines,kinematic features,probabilistic processes,geospatial features,machine learning,left-to-right hidden Markov models,vessel interaction classification,innovative intelligent systems,pattern classification,contextual information,Time series analysis,maritime situation analysis framework,Critical Infrastructure Protection,Big Data,vessel tracking data,Trajectory,Machine Learning,probability,complex vessel trajectory analysis,pattern representation,traffic engineering computing,Surveillance,maritime domain knowledge,marine vehicles,Intelligent Systems,learning (artificial intelligence),Security,security,"
"maritime anomaly detection in ferry tracks","2017","This paper proposes a methodology for the automatic detection of anomalous shipping tracks traced by ferries. The approach comprises a set of models as a basis for outlier detection: A Gaussian process (GP) model regresses displacement information collected over time, and a Markov chain based detector makes use of the direction (heading) information. GP regression is performed together with Median Absolute Deviation to account for contaminated training data. The methodology utilizes the coordinates of a given ferry recorded on a second by second basis via Automatic Identification System. Its effectiveness is demonstrated on a dataset collected in the Solent area.","Markov processes,automatic anomalous shipping track detection,Hidden Markov models,unsupervised learning,Marine vehicles,Anomaly Detection,ferry tracks,Markov chain based detector,marine navigation,Gaussian Processes,heading information,displacement information regression,regression analysis,outlier detection,data analysis,Median Absolute Deviation,object tracking,ships,ferry coordinates,automatic identification system,direction information,Training data,Gaussian processes,traffic information systems,Artificial intelligence,median absolute deviation,maritime anomaly detection,Solent area,Maritime Traffic,Gaussian process model,Detectors,"
"maritime threat detection using plan recognition","2012","Existing algorithms for maritime threat detection employ a variety of normalcy models that are probabilistic and/or rule-based. Unfortunately, they can be limited in their ability to model the subtlety and complexity of multiple vessel types and their spatio-temporal events, yet their representation is needed to accurately detect anomalies in maritime scenarios. To address these limitations, we apply plan recognition algorithms for maritime anomaly detection. In particular, we examine hierarchical task network (HTN) and case-based algorithms for plan recognition, which detect anomalies by generating expected behaviors for use as a basis for threat detection. We compare their performance with a behavior recognition algorithm on simulated riverine maritime traffic. On a set of simulated maritime scenarios, these plan recognition algorithms outperformed the behavior recognition algorithm, except for one reactive behavior task in which the inverse occurred. Furthermore, our case-based plan recognizer outperformed our HTN algorithm. On the short-term reactive planning scenarios, the plan recognition algorithms outperformed the behavior recognition algorithm on routine plan following. However, they are significantly outperformed on the anomalous scenarios.","planning,plan recognition algorithms,maritime threat detection,Hidden Markov models,multiple vessel types,naval engineering,Prediction algorithms,routine plan,Planning,simulated maritime scenarios,hierarchical task network,Accuracy,normalcy models,marine systems,short-term reactive planning scenarios,HTN algorithm,case-based plan recognizer,Collision avoidance,Probabilistic logic,spatio-temporal events,case-based algorithms,maritime anomaly detection,reactive behavior task,behavior recognition algorithm,national security,Labeling,case-based reasoning,simulated riverine maritime traffic,"
"unsupervised extraction of knowledge from s-ais data for maritime situational awareness","2013","Automatic vessel behaviour analysis is a key factor for maritime surveillance and relies on an efficient representation of knowledge about vessels activity. Emerging technologies such as space-based AIS provides a new dimension of service and creates a need for new methods able to learn a maritime scene model at an oceanic scale. In this paper, we propose such a framework: a probabilistic normalcy model of vessel dynamics is learned using unsupervised techniques applied on historical S-AIS data and used for anomaly detection and prediction tasks, thus providing functionalities for high-level situational awareness (level 2 and 3 of the JDL).","surveillance,vessel activity,Clustering algorithms,Hidden Markov models,knowledge representation,unsupervised learning,anomaly detection,Marine vehicles,vessel dynamics,probabilistic normalcy model,security of data,automatic vessel behaviour analysis,maritime situational awareness,space-based AIS,marine safety,marine engineering,emerging technology,maritime surveillance,Data models,Length measurement,oceanic scale,vehicle dynamics,unsupervised knowledge extraction,prediction tasks,high-level situational awareness,maritime scene model,historical S-AIS data,Trajectory,unsupervised techniques,probability,knowledge acquisition,Surveillance,marine vehicles,"
"fuzzy/human risk analysis for maritime situational awareness and decision support","2017","Human computation (HC) is an active research field in which people play a notable role as computational elements in an automated system with the aim of arriving at a truly symbiotic human-computer interaction. Situational awareness (SA) and decision support systems (DSSs) are two domains where human computation is rapidly advancing, with the latter arising as an invaluable vehicle to achieve the former. Fuzzy systems and fuzzy logic are two commonly employed tools in these domains due to their inherent capabilities of representing and processing vague and imprecise information while conveying the analysis results in an interpretable fashion. In this paper, we elaborate on the human computation aspects of risk analysis within SA and DSS conducted with the aid of fuzzy sets. The study makes the following contributions: (1) we argue that risk analysis must be a highly automated yet still human-centric endeavour and highlight four manners in which the human component provides value to the underlying data/information fusion processes; (2) we illustrate this fuzzy/human risk analysis methodology through a multi-modular Risk Management Framework (RMF) architecture and its application to the maritime domain, particularly in hard-soft data fusion, automated response generation to maritime incidents, port anomaly filtering and dynamic risk management triggered by contextual knowledge and (3) the framework under discussion can be extrapolated to other domains with negligible effort.","decision support systems,RMF,HC,Risk management,Hidden Markov models,human computer interaction,Human computer interaction,fuzzy logic,maritime situational awareness,marine engineering,risk management,human computation,Spread spectrum communication,Decision support systems,human risk analysis,DSS,risk management framework,fuzzy systems,Data mining,Fuzzy risk analysis,"
"evaluation and comparison of anomaly detection algorithms in annotated datasets from the maritime domain","2015","Anomaly detection supports human decision makers in their surveillance tasks to ensure security. To gain the trust of the operator, it is important to develop a robust system, which gives the operator enough insight to take a rational choice about future steps. In this work, the maritime domain is investigated. Here, anomalies occur in trajectory data. Hence, a normal model for the trajectories has to be estimated. Despite the goal of anomaly detection in real life operations, until today, mostly simulated anomalies have been evaluated to measure the performance of different algorithms. Therefore, an annotation tool is developed to provide a ground truth on a non-simulative dataset. The annotated data is used to compare different algorithms with each other. For the given dataset, first experiments are conducted with the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and the Kernel Density Estimator (KDE). For the evaluation of the algorithms, precision, recall, and f1-score are compared.","surveillance,GMM,Clustering algorithms,Hidden Markov models,Intelligent systems,Anomaly detection,Gaussian Mixture Model,trajectory data,annotation tool,human decision making,operator trust,Sea measurements,nonsimulative dataset,mixture models,kernel density estimator,marine engineering,Gaussian processes,recall value,ground truth,maritime domain,robust system,Maritime domain,f1-score value,Kernel Density Estimation,Gaussian mixture model,annotated datasets,Trajectory,surveillance tasks,anomaly detection algorithms,Surveillance,normal model,precision value,KDE,"
