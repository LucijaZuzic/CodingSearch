"maritime anomaly detection in a real-world scenario: ever given grounding in the suez canal","2022","In this paper we present how automatic maritime anomaly detection tools can be successfully applied in real-world situations such as the major event of the container vessel Ever Given, which grounded in the Suez Canal on March 23rd 2021. The anomaly detector is designed to process the available sequence of Automatic Identification System (AIS) reports, information from ground-based or satellite radar systems if available, and contextual information defining the expected nominal behavior of navigation. A statistical hypothesis testing procedure is sequentially run to decide whether or not a deviation from the nominal behavior happened within a specific time period, for instance two consecutive data points. We show, based on the recorded AIS data from the Ever Given, that the proposed detector could have been triggered and alerted to anomalous behavior fully 19 minutes before the grounding.","anomaly detector,Anomaly detection,Marine vehicles,Grounding,statistical hypothesis testing,Ever Given grounding,automatic maritime anomaly detection tools,statistical analysis,Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process,Testing,ships,Containers,automatic identification system,radar,maritime surveillance,satellite radar systems,contextual information,container vessel,Suez Canal,Artificial intelligence,ground-based system,marine engineering computing,Maritime anomaly detection,Irrigation,statistical hypothesis testing procedure,expected nominal behavior,AIS data,"
"the lama system: a “smart” magnetometer network for harbour protection","2022","This work describes the development of an underwater anti-intrusion system based on a magnetometer self-informed network, whose purpose is to detect the presence of threats in the proximity of critical infrastructures (e.g, terrorist divers in harbours). In this context, the magnetic network fills the gaps of sonar systems at the critical boundaries of the water volume to be controlled (sea bed, docks, …), where acoustic performances deteriorate due to reflections and attenuations. The system operates in a port-protection scenario, characterized by a medium-high environmental magnetic noise that can hide the diver signal (a diver is a weak, quasi-point-like, moving source). The magnetometer network processes two inputs: the environmental magnetic noise and a signal including the target magnetic signal superimposed to the same noise; the frequencies of a diver signal lie within the noise band, hence frequency filtering proves inadequate for noise removal. The basic idea underlying the system is to measure and use the noise itself to filter the overall signal; measuring noise supports a background-subtraction process that allows to extract the target signal and therefore detect the threat presence. The effectiveness of the procedure depends on the positions of magnetometers: sensors must be close enough to one another to measure the common background noise, and, at the same time, should be distant enough from one another so that just one sensor can measure the target signal. To generate alarms when a threat is detected, a real-time software application processes data and activates a visual and acoustic alarm upon identification of a magnetic anomaly. Sea trials carried out in port areas provided extremely satisfactory results in the detection of intruders. The paper presents experimental results obtained during the method validation tests, when intruders were moving in the surrounding undersea environment.","Environmental magnetism,Marine geophysics,Time series analysis,Magnetic anomaly detection,Underwater magnetic systems,Harbour protection,"

"maritime situational awareness forensics tools for a common information sharing environment (cise)","2019","CISE stands for Common Information Sharing Environment and refers to an architecture and set of protocols, procedures and services for the exchange of data and information across Maritime Authorities of EU (European Union) Member States (MS's). In the context of enabling the implementation and adoption of CISE by different MS's, EU has funded a number of projects that enable the development of subsystems and adaptors intended to allow MS's to connect and make use of CISE. In this context, the Integrated Systems Laboratory (ISL) has led the development of the corresponding Hellenic and Cypriot CISE by developing a Control, Command & Information (C2I) system that unifies all partial maritime surveillance systems into one National Situational Picture Management (NSPM) system, and adaptors that allow the interconnection of the corresponding national legacy systems to CISE and the exchange of data, information and requests between the two MS's. Furthermore, a set of forensics tools that allow geospatial & time filtering and detection of anomalies, risk incidents, fake MMSIs, suspicious speed changes, collision paths, and gaps in AIS (Automatic Identification System), have been developed by combining motion models, AI, deep learning and fusion algorithms using data from different databases through CISE. This paper briefly discusses these developments within the EU CISE-2020, Hellenic CISE and CY-CISE projects and the benefits from the sharing of maritime data across CISE for both maritime surveillance and security. The prospect of using CISE for the creation of a considerably rich database that could be used for forensics analysis and detection of suspicious maritime traffic and maritime surveillance is discussed.","EU Member States,surveillance,maritime traffic,CY-CISE projects,Maritime Security,Distributed CISE database,Forensics,security of data,maritime security,common information sharing environment,National Situational Picture Management system,Cypriot CISE,MS,deep learning,automatic identification system,marine engineering,Maritime Surveillance,Databases,AIS,CISE,C2I system,Europe,Information management,corresponding national legacy systems,Control,Artificial intelligence,Hellenic CISE,NSPM system,command and control systems,Command,maritime surveillance systems,control-command-information system,national security,fusion algorithms,integrated systems laboratory,ISL,Surveillance,AI,Tools,learning (artificial intelligence),time filtering,forensics tools,"
"an integrated maritime reasoning and monitoring system","2012","Maritime information systems typically offer system features for data collection, information fusion and the automated construction of a basic recognized maritime picture for human operators. However making sense of maritime situations is still very much an intensive human-based cognitive endeavor. Limited human resources face difficult cognitive challenges in making sense of huge amount of data generated daily by dynamic round-the-clock maritime shipping and port activities. An effective information exploitation system for maritime surveillance and monitoring is expected to be able to augment human-based surveillance and monitoring operations with machine-based computing capabilities to interpret and reason about massive amount of situational information, as well as transforming this knowledge into actionable decision indicators for the human decision makers. The Defence Science & Technology Agency (DSTA) has developed the PACKED model to guide the exploration and development of computing technologies that support human decision making and other cognitive challenges in information rich, complex, and dynamic operational environments. An integrated maritime reasoning and monitoring system illustrates how computing technologies are applied in the areas of Attention, Knowledge, and Comprehension to support situation analysis and monitoring processes for maritime surveillance. The maritime reasoning and monitoring system consist of Bayesian reasoning, entity network analysis, and movement pattern analysis, to integrate, analyze, interpret and reason about maritime data. The Graylist Network Analysis (GNA) engine probes networks of entity-relationships to uncover â€œgraylistedâ€ entities that are closely associated with blacklisted entities. The Movement Pattern Analysis (MPA) engine uncovers common patterns in vessel movements and monitors real-time for maritime traffic data for anomalous vessel movements. The Bayesian network inference engine combines situation information from data sources and analysis results produced by analytical engines such as the GNA and MPA, with Bayesian knowledge models in order to infer probabilities of occurrences of maritime scenarios.","surveillance,naval engineering computing,sensor fusion,Maritime Monitoring System,attention-knowledge-and-comprehension,maritime traffic data,MPA engine,graylist network analysis,Bayes methods,Anomaly Detection,Monitoring,PACKED model,Bayesian reasoning,entity network analysis,decision indicator,information fusion,Bayesian knowledge model,Scenario Modeling,cognitive challenge,marine systems,military computing,data collection,Bayesian network inference engine,human-based cognitive endeavor,anomalous vessel movement,maritime surveillance,entity-relationship,Humans,GNA engine,Relationship Analysis,dynamic round-the-clock maritime shipping,maritime information system,information exploitation system,inference mechanisms,machine-based computing,port activity,Engines,Pattern analysis,Bayesian Reasoning,Trend Analysis,Algorithm design and analysis,Computational modeling,Cognition,maritime reasoning,maritime monitoring system,human-based surveillance,movement pattern analysis,"
"visual analytics for the detection of anomalous maritime behavior","2008","The surveillance of large sea areas often generates huge amounts of multidimensional data. Exploring, analyzing and finding anomalous behavior within this data is a complex task. Confident decisions upon the abnormality of a particular vessel behavior require a certain level of situation awareness that may be difficult to achieve when the operator is overloaded by the available information. Based on a visual analytics process model, we present a novel system that supports the acquisition of situation awareness and the involvement of the user in the anomaly detection process using two layers of interactive visualizations. The system uses an interactive data mining module that supports the insertion of the user's knowledge and experience in the creation, validation and continuous update of the normal model of the environment.","surveillance,visual analytics process model,data mining,vessel behavior,situation awareness,anomaly detection,visual analytics,data visualisation,interactive systems,security of data,interaction,interactive data mining module,large sea area,multidimensional data,marine engineering,engineering computing,interactive visualization,visualization,anomalous maritime traffic behavior detection,"
"improving maritime anomaly detection and situation awareness through interactive visualization","2008","Surveillance of large land, air or sea areas with a multitude of sensor and sensor types typically generates huge amounts of data. Human operators trying to establish individual or collective maritime situation awareness are often overloaded by this information. In order to help them cope with this information overload, we have developed a combined methodology of data visualization, interaction and mining techniques that allows filtering out anomalous vessels, by building a model over normal behavior from which the user can detect deviations. The methodology includes a set of interactive visual representations that support the insertion of the userpsilas knowledge and experience in the creation, validation and continuous update of the normal model. Additionally, this paper presents a software prototype that implements the suggested methodology.","surveillance,situation awareness,anomaly detection,visual analytics,data visualisation,Buildings,interactive systems,visual data mining,interaction,marine systems,Training data,interactive visual representations,Data models,Humans,graphical user interfaces,maritime anomaly detection,Data visualization,interactive visualization,Visualization,visualization,Data mining,"
"texture anomaly detection in radar imagery","1994","A radar image of the land or sea will contain extended regions of apparently homogeneous textures arising from, for example, forested areas or uniformly driven expanses of water. However, such regions may contain subtle texture anomalies which indicate the presence of a feature of interest such as a change in tree density due to environmental effects, damping of the sea surface due to the presence of pollutants or the presence of land-based or maritime military targets. For this reason, it is of interest to develop methods of detecting anomalies in textured regions. A strategy for texture anomaly detection is to estimate the multi-variate probability density function (PDF) of a texture segment using the whole homogeneous region as training data and then to calculate the likelihood of occurrence of each individual segment within the region given the PDF estimate. Those texture segments with anomalous likelihood values can then be flagged as potential texture anomalies.<>","Image texture analysis,radar imagery,PDF estimate,image texture,texture segment,Statistics,statistical analysis,texture anomaly detection,multi-variate probability density,Radar,radar image,texture segments,radar,"
"fast and parameter-light rare behavior detection in maritime trajectories","2020","Rare behaviors indicate important events and situations in maritime surveillance applications. State-of-the-art methods provide many effective solutions to detect anomalous behaviors. Meanwhile, most solutions are parameter-laden and too costly to identify useful rare behaviors with human knowledge in a visual analytics manner. This paper is concerned with a scheme cross trajectories, vessel attributes and the movement context for detecting rare behaviors through preprocessing, kNN-based clustering, and verification. Although the scheme involves several parameters, we demonstrate that they are able to be tackled in thresholds. As a result, a rare behavior factor is the single parameter that affect the detecting results. The proposed scheme is evaluated via a simulated data set for performance and a real life AIS data for effectiveness. Results show that high accuracy to labelled anomalies and useful rare behaviors can be achieved.","Rare behaviour detection,Trajectory,Visual analytics,"
"detecting anomalous maritime container itineraries for anti-fraud and supply chain security","2012","An important contribution to anti-fraud and supply-chain security comes from the development of Risk Analysis tools targeted to the discovery of suspicious containerized transportations. In this work we present the Anomalous Container Itinerary Detection (ACID) framework that analyses Container Status Messages to discover irregular container shipments. The system has been developed at JRC as part of an in-house global route-based risk analysis facility for containers monitoring. It adopts a flexible and modular design and its preliminary prototype applies an SVM one-class classifier to detect anomalies.

"airborne maritime surveillance using magnetic anomaly detection signature","2020","For an airborne sensor, there is a pressing need to be able to detect/track submerged submarines, shipwrecks, sea mines, unexploded explosive ordnance, and buried drums during maritime surveillance. Traditional usage is the magnetic anomaly detection (MAD), where the small changes in the earth's magnetic field caused by the ferrous components of the targets are measured. The primary means of long-range detection and classification of targets are with passive and active acoustic sensors, and MAD is used for accurate final localization. MAD could also be used for land-based targets but this is not common. Knowing the relationship between the magnetic signature and the kinematic parameters, the tracking problem can be formulated under a Bayesian framework. In this article, multiple nonlinear filters are used for a real single surface-target tracking problem in maritime surveillance using an airborne total-field sensor. The posterior CramÃ©r-Rao lower bound for MAD is derived. Given the total-field measurements, these filters can estimate the kinematic states as well as the permanent moments and induced moments effectively. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed nonlinear filters as well as the impact of using MAD as part of airborne surveillance.","airborne radar,Kinematics,military radar,posterior Cramer-Rao lower bound,marine radar,underwater target tracking,single surface-target tracking problem,radar detection,active acoustic sensors,multiple nonlinear filters,long-range detection,Sea measurements,underwater vehicles,Magnetoacoustic effects,Airborne target tracking,target tracking,Magnetometers,land-based targets,magnetic anomaly detection signature,MAD,maritime surveillance,Target tracking,unexploded explosive ordnance,total-field measurements,airborne total-field sensor,nonlinear target tracking,magnetic anomaly detection,nonlinear filters,Magnetic moments,radar tracking,accurate final localization,buried drums,sea mines,ferrous components,airborne maritime surveillance,Earth,Surveillance,airborne sensor,passive sensors,magnetic signature,"
"3d reconstruction of a shallow archaeological site from high-resolution acoustic imagery: the grace dieu","2008","Acoustic imaging and characterisation of buried objects (and in particular archaeological materials) in shallow-water (<5m) is often unsuccessful owing to problems related to vessel-induced bubble turbulence and the restricted acoustic geometry of the system. A 2D surveying method that tackles these problems has been tested on the known wreck of the Grace Dieu (1418), Henry V’s flagship, currently buried within the inter-tidal sediments of the Hamble River. The wooden hull is recognisable in the seismic sections as a high amplitude anomaly underlain by an acoustic blanking zone. Close survey line spacing (ca. 1m) allowed the construction of time slices, identifying the ovate plan of the hull. High, predominantly negative, reflection coefficients suggest this anomaly corresponds to degraded oak timbers buried within the sediment. Combining the data enabled the construction of a (pseudo)-3D image, revealing the dimensions and shape of the hull remains for the first time.","Shallow water,Chirp,Maritime archaeology,Buried wood,"
"maritime anomaly detection of malicious data spoofing and stealth deviations from nominal route exploiting heterogeneous sources of information","2021","Based on a proper stochastic formulation of the vessel dynamic, exploiting piecewise Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) mean-reverting processes, we propose an effective anomaly detection procedure to jointly reveal Automatic Identification System (AIS) data spoofing and/or surreptitious deviations from the planned route. Supported by reliable information from monitoring systems (coastal radars and spaceborne satellite sensors), an expanded five-hypothesis testing problem is posed involving two anomaly detection strategies based on the Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test (GLRT) and the Model Order Selection (MOS) methodologies.","vessel dynamic,maximum likelihood estimation,spaceborne satellite sensors,piecewise Ornstein-Uhlenbeck mean-reverting processes,generalized likelihood ratio test,model order selection,five-hypothesis testing problem,Sensor systems,Automatic Identification System data spoofing,monitoring systems,security of data,maritime security,Sea measurements,Stochastic processes,maritime situational awareness,target tracking,GLRT,stealth deviations,Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process,automatic identification system,marine engineering,stochastic processes,nominal route,stochastic formulation,data spoofing,Gaussian processes,Radar tracking,maritime anomaly detection,coastal radars,Maritime anomaly detection,MOS,multiple statistical hypothesis test,Sensors,heterogeneous information sources,Spaceborne radar,Radar detection,"
"mining vessel tracking data for maritime domain applications","2016","The growing number of remote sensing systems and ship reporting technologies (e.g. Automatic Identification System, Long Range Identification and Tracking, radar tracking, Earth Observation) are generating an overwhelming amount of spatio-temporal and geographically distributed data related to vessels and their movements. Research on reliable data mining techniques has proven essential to the discovery of knowledge from such increasingly available information on ship traffic at sea. Data driven knowledge discovery has very recently demonstrated its value in fields that go beyond the original maritime safety and security remits of such data. They include, but are not limited to, fisheries management, maritime spatial planning, gridding ship emissions, mapping activities at sea, risk assessment of offshore platforms, and trade indicators. The extraction of useful information from maritime Big Data is thus a key element in providing operational authorities, policy-makers and scientists with supporting tools to understand what is happening at sea and improve maritime knowledge. This work will provide a survey of the recent JRC research activities relevant to automatic anomaly detection and knowledge discovery in the maritime domain. Data mining, data analytics and predictive analysis examples are introduced using real data.

"improving sar wind retrieval through automatic anomalous pixel detection","2023","Satellite observations are increasingly in demand and valuable for monitoring the ocean and coastal winds in near-real-time and analyzing the data historically. However, soared up human activities, man-made constructions, and marine traffics negatively interfere and affect the reliability of observations and raise concerns about the trustworthiness of using satellite winds for many applications, such as offshore wind energy, even though Sentinel synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data is freely and easily accessible. In this paper, we presented a novel methodological framework for localization and suppression of anomalous pixels (APs), which deteriorate the confidence and accuracy of the retrieved SAR wind speeds. The backbone of the implementation relied on the constant false alarm rate (CFAR) algorithm, one of the automatic target recognition algorithms. We used a large dataset of SAR subscenes to model different sea clutter conditions after removing the potential targets. We selected the suitable distribution model that maintains a constant probability of false alarm (pfa) for the entire SAR scene. The proper pfa was optimized in various SAR scenes ranging from scenes with a considerable number of APs, such as ships and wind park clusters, to scenes with no visible APs under different wind speed conditions. The pfa optimization process prevented real wind pixels from being misidentified as APs. Applying CFAR to the logarithmic scale of raw digital numbers (log-DNs) domain with a pfa of about 3.17 × 10-5, we extracted SAR wind speeds around each ocean buoy before and after CFAR process, comparing them with their corresponding in situ wind measurements. This led to significant improvement in the quality and accuracy of SAR wind data retrieval, especially in regions with numerous man-made constructions and high marine traffics. We tested and validated our approach in the North Sea and two regions along the eastern coast of the U.S. The enclosed region, serving as a marine route for harbors in Delaware Bay, showed a substantial improvement in RMSE and BIAS after applying our approach, reducing RMSE from 2.4 m/s to 1.6 m/s and the BIAS from −1.5 m/s to −0.3 m/s. The open ocean region demonstrated stable RMSE and BIAS, indicating preservation of real wind data, as only APs affecting SAR wind speed were considered during the process.","Offshore wind farm,SAR,Sentinel-1,CFAR,Anomalous pixel,Coastal environment,"
"augmented ship tracking under occlusion conditions from maritime surveillance videos","2020","Ship tracking provides crucial on-site microscopic kinematic traffic information which benefits maritime traffic flow analysis, ship safety enhancement, traffic control, etc., and thus has attracted considerable research attentions in the maritime surveillance community. Conventional ship tracking methods yield satisfied results by exploring distinct visual ship features in maritime images, which may fail when the target ship is partially or fully sheltered by obstacles (e.g., ships, waves, etc.) in maritime videos. To overcome the difficulty, we propose an augmented ship tracking framework via the kernelized correlation filter (KCF) and curve fitting algorithm. First, the KCF model is introduced to track ships in the consecutive maritime images and obtain raw ship trajectory dataset. Second, the data anomaly detection and rectification procedure are implemented to rectify the contaminated ship positions. For the purpose of performance evaluation, we implement the proposed framework and another three popular ship tracking models on the four typical ship occlusion videos. The experimental results show that our proposed framework successfully tracks ships in maritime video clips with high accuracy (i.e., the average root mean square error (RMSE), root mean square percentage error (RMSPE), mean absolute deviation (MAD) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) are less than 10), which significantly outperforms the other popular ship trackers.","Smart ship,maritime surveillance videos,Marine vehicles,Feature extraction,maritime traffic flow analysis,augmented ship tracking,ship trajectory dataset,on-site microscopic kinematic traffic information,visual ship features,Videos,kernelized correlation filter,object tracking,ships,marine safety,marine engineering,Target tracking,object detection,feature extraction,maritime images,Correlation,curve fitting algorithm,image filtering,video signal processing,Training,curve fitting,ship occlusion videos,data anomaly detection,Visualization,traffic control,ship occlusion,traffic engineering computing,ship safety enhancement,video surveillance,visual ship tracking,"
"a four year (2007–2010) analysis of long-lasting deep convective systems in the mediterranean basin","2013","Long-lasting, deep convective systems (DCS) occurring in the Mediterranean basin have been investigated for the 2007–2010years using geostationary Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) satellite data, supported by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) analyses and severe weather reports recorded by the European Severe Weather Database (ESWD). The spatial and seasonal variability of DCS occurrence have been investigated, as well as the most favourable synoptic precursors for their initiation. The analysis has shown the existence of some preferential areas of DCS genesis, mainly located in the western (i.e., around Balearic Islands) and central (i.e., Ionic and Tyrrhenian seas) Mediterranean, where these systems develop and grow preferentially in fall (i.e., September and October). The analysis of a selected set of Synoptic Precursors (SPs) has shown how the totality of the identified cases has occurred downstream a mid-tropospheric (500hPa) disturbance (trough or cut-off) within a southerly flow, with high values of θe (at 850hPa) and precipitable water. Moreover, the approaching of an upper level tropopause dynamical anomaly coupled with a local maximum of upper and low level horizontal wind speed, seems to play a very important role in triggering convection. Finally, a careful crosscheck of the detected cases with the ESWD reports has allowed to investigate the severity of these systems, as they often affect population and produce significant damages. This study has to be considered a necessary step towards the development of a larger climatologic database of long-lasting, deep convective events occurring in the Mediterranean sea, as well as the definition of a specific conceptual model based on synoptic precursors, having the long-term issue of setting up an objective procedure to support regional meteorological services in early decisions and accurate nowcasting.","Severe weather reports,Synoptic precursors,Deep convective systems,Mediterranean basin,Satellite imagery,"

The material may add to the understanding of mid- to upper-level circulation patterns and associated development of the weather systems over midlatitude, subtropical, and tropical areas in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Basic principles regarding the interpretation of WV imagery and dynamical fields for synoptic-scale applications have been extracted from the considerations and summarized.","Potential vorticity anomalies,Jet streams,Atmospheric fronts,Tropical cyclone intensification,Cyclogenesis,Extratropical transition,Baroclinic zone,Blocking circulation,"

"framework for ship trajectory forecasting based on linear stationary models using automatic identification system","2022","Maritime surveillance is of utmost priority for a nation's security, and hence it's economy. For maritime awareness, coastal surveillance, and maritime activities in the Region of Interest (ROI) should be monitored. One of the ways to keep this in check is to restrain unwanted infiltration. Monitoring unwanted infiltration is feasible through vessel trajectory forecasting and anomaly detection in real time. Most solutions for trajectory predictions are available but require a huge amount of historical data, and high-power computing resources. Here, the requirement is developing a decision support framework consisting of both lite weight approaches for short-term predictions and deep learning-based techniques for long-term forecasting. This paper aims to find the suitability of Linear Stationary Models (LSM) like the Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average Model (ARIMA) for predicting and forecasting the Vessel Trajectory as means of lite weight short-term predictions. For this purpose, the Automatic Identification System (AIS) dataset of the U.S. West Coast is used. The significant effort was for data pre-processing to create a robust dataset for model training. An appropriate model after the model-selection process is used for trajectory forecasting. The model's accuracy is validated using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) performance indices for residual and forecast errors. A window generator model is integrated with the best-fitted ARIMA model for recursive real-time predictions, with varied sizes and visualization. The proposed time-series model provided a very high accuracy as the RMSE value for prediction and 48 hours forecast are 0.023 and 0.017, respectively.","Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average Model,Window Generator,Trajectory Forecast,Time Series Analysis,Automatic Identification System,Maritime Surveillance,"

"interactive visualization of normal behavioral models and expert rules for maritime anomaly detection","2009","Maritime surveillance systems analyze vast amounts of heterogeneous sensor data from a large number of objects. In order to support the operator while monitoring such systems, the identification of anomalous vessels or situations that might need further investigation may reduce the operator's cognitive load. While it is worth acknowledging that many existing mining applications support identification of anomalous behavior, autonomous anomaly detection systems are rarely used in the real world, since the detection of anomalous behavior is normally not a well-defined problem and therefore, human expert knowledge is needed. This calls for the development of interaction components that can support the user in the detection process. In order to support the comprehension of the knowledge embedded in the system, we propose an interactive way of visualizing expert rules and normal behavioral models built from the data. The overall goal is to facilitate the validation and update of these models and signatures, supporting the insertion of human expert knowledge while improving confidence and trust in the system.","embedded systems,surveillance,data mining,human expert knowledge system,National security,anomaly detection,visual analytics,Sensor systems,Monitoring,normal behavioral models,data visualisation,security of data,data analysis,Computer graphics,marine engineering,Humans,autonomous anomaly detection systems,heterogeneous sensor data,Data visualization,expert systems,maritime surveillance systems,interactive visualization,association rules mining,maritime situation awareness,rules/signatures,Object detection,Surveillance,Data mining,AIS data,Data security,embedded system,"

"maritime vessel route extraction and automatic information system (ais) spoofing detection","2021","Automated Identification System (AIS) comprises of a global real-time network of maritime vessels, transmitters, and satellite or ground-station receivers, which are used to track and record time-stamped static (vessel-id, type, etc.) and dynamic (location, course, speed, etc.) information of all maritime vessels. Traditionally, this data feed has been used by vessel traffic services to avoid vessel collisions, however increasingly, marine researchers and data scientists have shown interest in developing algorithms on historical AIS data-dumps with diverse objectives such as estimating trends in global ocean-currents, maritime logistical planning, fishing fleet monitoring and enhancing maritime security. This paper aims to propose a novel shipping-route extraction algorithm to process historical AIS data (running into tens of gigabytes of daily data, from more than a hundred thousand maritime vessels), to effectively characterize global shipping route behaviour and capture its seasonal trends. This is done by formulating a sigmoid based turning waypoint identification, which does not solely depend on the change in the course of a vessel, derived from AIS message. The AIS data is further processed to excerpt the vesselâ€™s distance from the nearest port and nearest shore with resolution of about 1 km, which forms a handy metric for the identification of suspicious ports. Several other use cases are also explored, which include detecting various anomalies in individual vessel behaviour such as intentional or unintentional switching off AIS transmission, shipping-lane deviations, spoofing transmission messages. To tackle spoofing anomaly, various spoofing identification methods are discussed. A region-based spoofing identification algorithm is developed to identify spoofing points under multiple categories using a clustering algorithm.

BPAD has previously been successively deployed and evaluated in several similar domains, including Maritime Domain Awareness, Train Fleet Maintenance, and Alarm filtering. Similar as for those applications, we argue in the paper that the deployment of BPAD in area of crime monitoring potentially can improve the situation awareness of criminal activities, by providing automatic detection of suspicious behaviors, and uncovering large scale patterns.","Anomaly detection,Bayes methods,Monitoring,Situation awareness,Data analysis,Image color analysis,behavioural sciences computing,geographically tagged alarm data,situation awareness improvement,Bayesian statistics,Bayesian parametric statistical anomaly detection method,criminal behavior trends,BPAD,Criminal behaviour,criminal behavior pattern,crime monitoring,suspected criminal behavior,suspicious behavior automatic detection,Market research,suspected criminal activities,Data collection,Data mining,police data processing,"
"integration of in-situ and multi-sensor satellite observations for long-term water quality monitoring in coastal areas","2020","Recently, there have been significant efforts in the integration of in-situ and satellite observations for effective monitoring of coastal areas (e.g., the Copernicus program of the European Space Agency). In this study, a 15-year diurnal variation of Water Constituent Concentrations (WCCs) was retrieved from multi-sensor satellite images and in-situ hyperspectral measurements using Radiative Transfer (RT) modeling in the Dutch Wadden Sea. The existing RT model 2SeaColor was inverted against time series of in-situ hyperspectral measurements of water leaving reflectances (Rrs [sr−1]) for the simultaneous retrieval of WCCs (i.e., Chlorophyll-a (Chla), Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM), Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM)) on a daily basis between 2003 and 2018 at the NIOZ jetty station (the NJS) located in the Dutch part of the Wadden Sea. At the same time, the existing coupled atmosphere-hydro-optical RT model MOD2SEA was used for the simultaneous retrieval of WCCs from time series of multi-sensor satellite images of the MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) onboard ENVISAT, Multispectral Instrument (MSI) onboard Sentinel-2 and Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) onboard Sentinel-3 between 2003 and 2018 over the Dutch Wadden Sea. At the NJS, a direct comparison (Taylor diagram and statistical analysis) showed strong agreement between in-situ and satellite-derived WCC values (Chla: R2 ≥ 0.70, RMSE ≤7.5 [mg m−3]; SPM: R2 ≥ 0.72, RMSE ≤5.5 [g m−3]; CDOM absorption at 440 nm: R2 ≥ 0.67, RMSE ≤1.7 [m−1]). Next, the plausibility of the spatial variation of retrieved WCCs over the study area was evaluated by generating maps of Chla [mg m−3], SPM [g m−3], and CDOM absorption at 440 nm [m−1] from MERIS and OLCI images using the MOD2SEA model.

"automatic fault detection system for mining conveyor using distributed acoustic sensor","2022","Condition monitoring of mining conveyor is a highly essential task to ensure minimum disruption to the mining operational system. Failure of one or more conveyor components can result in significant operational downtime, economic loss, and safety risks. The current monitoring method still involves subjective measure from maintenance engineers, where at some cases, fault can be left undetected and leads into site incident. Therefore, there is a high demand for real-time condition monitoring technology to detect early fault on conveyor. In this study, the effective application of distributed optical fibre sensor (DOFS) was explored for long distance real-time condition monitoring of mining conveyor. The fault detection framework was developed by integrating and modifying the Isolation Forest algorithm to analyse optical signals for effective detection of defective idlers. Further, the optical signal was analysed to extract the damage progression of defective idler with time and space. The results were used to classify various levels of damage and to set appropriate damage thresholds. Also, software interface, that can be used to set the sensing parameters, to collect, analyse, and visualise the signal in real-time, was developed. Finally, the developed condition monitoring system was used to monitor a 1.6 km long section of a conveyor structure in Western Australia for a period of 10 months. The results and findings from the field monitoring were presented together with automated fault detection framework for condition monitoring of mining conveyor.","Infrastructure,Isolation forest,Signal processing,Anomaly detection,Field monitoring,Optics,"
"high fidelity digital twin-based anomaly detection and localization for smart water grid operation management","2023","Smart Water Grid (SWG) plays a critical role in sustaining cities economic and social development, but challenges remain in fully realizing the benefits of SWG. While Digital twin (DT) has been discussed in some literature for possible SWG applications, there has been limited, or no technical framework developed to facilitate SWG operation and management. In this paper, a generic framework is developed for constructing SWG high fidelity Digital Twin (DT) by integrating digital thread with various digital models for visualization, data-driven analysis, physics-based simulations, and decision-making support. Both the physics-based models and data-driven models are trained/retrained and calibrated/re-calibrated respectively by using the data collected with the sensors installed throughout a SWG. The information derived from the SWG DT can be diagnostic, predictive, and prescriptive to significantly augment users’ intelligence for improving SWG operation and management. One important application of digital twin augmented intelligence is illustrated to timely detect and localize anomaly events, which may include, but not be limited to, pipe bursts and unauthorized water usages. The solution is tested on the selected areas in Singapore to construct the ever-green DT by calibrating and recalibrating the models for near real-time SWG operation management. The case study was conducted for three supply zones with the total pipeline length of more than 1000 km and 40 weeks of monitoring data, collected by 89 pressure monitoring stations and 8 flow meters at inlets and boundary. More than 3300 data-driven models are trained for optimizing the model performance to achieve accuracy of greater than 80% F1 score for detecting anomaly events, which are subsequently localized within 400 m with 2–3 days lead time.","Data analytics,Anomaly localization,Smart water grid,Anomaly detection,Machine learning,Digital twin,"

The composition of the communities, the occurrence of a positive temperature anomaly of about 0.5°C within the community beds and an extremely high amounts of methane in the bottom water, indicated the presence of cold seepage. The biomass of living Calyptogena was estimated to surpass 10 kg m−2, which was three orders of magnitude higher than that of the usual nearshore deep-sea benthic communities at an equivalent depth. The present results, combined with the electron microscopic evidence for symbiotic bacteria and the high sulfur content and negative σ34S value in the gills of the Calyptogena soyoae collected from the communities, and the stable and radioactive carbon isotopic compositions of the clam suggested that the seepage system of the Hatsushima site is similar to those found at other plate convergent areas such as off Oregon and off Peru and in the Japan Trench with symbiotic bacteria (probably sulfur and/or methane bacteria) playing important nutritional roles to support the seepage communities.",""

The multidimensional outlying features are first identified and defined. To deal with the uncertain property of trajectory, a maritime trajectory modeling is developed to explore the movement behavior from historical trajectories and build a maritime trajectory model for anomaly detection.

This letter proposes an algorithm for online detection of anomalies in the motion and the count of objects, using the output of a multiobject tracking algorithm. The surveillance area is partitioned by a square grid and the kinematic states that fall inside each cell of the grid are modelled by a Poisson point process. During the unsupervised learning phase, the parameters of the Poisson point process are estimated for each cell. The testing phase is performed sequentially by threshold detection at a specified level of significance.

"relating anomalous large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns to temperature and precipitation anomalies in the east asian monsoon region","2020","The anomalous large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns concerned with surface air temperature and precipitation anomalies within East Asian Monsoon region for winter and summer months from 1979 to 2017 are analyzed by employing the self-organizing map (SOM) neural network. The asymmetric 3 × 4 SOM neural network is firstly constructed with the geopotential height anomalies at 500-hPa level as the only input variable. Then 12 characteristic anomalous large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns (nodes) are identified. The composites of temperature and precipitation anomalies as well as vertical wind anomalies at 500-hPa level assigned to each node are generated and visualized. The spatial distributions of anomalous geopotential height (anticyclones or cyclones) are highly consistent with that of surface air temperature anomalies in both winter and summer. Most precipitation extremes in winter are attributed to the joint effect of the horizontal and vertical atmospheric motions, while strong air convection is prone to inducing extreme precipitation events in summer. Based on the SOM classification, the differences of atmospheric circulations, temperature and precipitation anomalies have also been partly identified in strong and weak phases of East Asia Monsoon.","Temperature and precipitation anomalies,Self-organizing map,East Asian Monsoon,Atmospheric circulation patterns,"
"maritime vessel traffic modeling in the context of concept drift","2017","Maritime traffic modeling serves the purpose of extracting human-readable information and discovering knowledge in the otherwise illegible mass of traffic data. The goal of this study is to examine the presence and character of fluctuations in maritime traffic patterns. The main objective is to identify such fluctuations and capture them in terms of a concept drift, i.e., unforeseen shifts in statistical properties of the modeled target occurring over time. The empirical study is based on a collection of AIS vessel tracking data, spanning over a year. The scope of the study limits the AIS data area to the Baltic region (9-31°E, 53-66°N), which experiences some of the most dense maritime traffic in the world. The investigations employ a novel maritime traffic modeling method based on the potential fields concept, adapted for this study to facilitate the examination of concept drift. The concept drift is made apparent in course of the statistical and visual analysis of the experimental results. This study shows a number of particular cases, in which the maritime traffic is affected by concept drifts of varying extent and character. The visual representations of the traffic models make shifts in the traffic patterns apparent and comprehensible to human eye. Based on the experimental outcomes, the robustness of the modeling method against concept drift in traffic is discussed and improvements are proposed. The outcomes provide insights into regularly reoccurring drifts and irregularities within the traffic data itself that may serve to further optimize the modeling method, and – in turn – the performance of detection based on it.","maritime traffic,concept drift,traffic modeling,anomaly detection,"
"contextual anomaly detection in crowded surveillance scenes","2014","This work addresses the problem of detecting human behavioural anomalies in crowded surveillance environments. We focus in particular on the problem of detecting subtle anomalies in a behaviourally heterogeneous surveillance scene. To reach this goal we implement a novel unsupervised context-aware process. We propose and evaluate a method of utilising social context and scene context to improve behaviour analysis. We find that in a crowded scene the application of Mutual Information based social context permits the ability to prevent self-justifying groups and propagate anomalies in a social network, granting a greater anomaly detection capability. Scene context uniformly improves the detection of anomalies in both datasets. The strength of our contextual features is demonstrated by the detection of subtly abnormal behaviours, which otherwise remain indistinguishable from normal behaviour.","Behaviour analysis,Context,Visual surveillance,Security,"

This work builds on unsupervised learning techniques which provide models for normal traffic behaviour. A methodology to associate tracks to the derived traffic model is then presented. This is done by the pre-extraction of contextual information as the baseline patterns of life (i.e., routes) in the area under investigation. In addition to a brief description of the approach to derive the routes, their characterization and representation is presented in support of exploitable knowledge to classify anomalies. A hierarchical reasoning is proposed where new tracks are first associated to existing routes based on their positional information only and â€œoff-routeâ€ vesselsâ€ are detected. Then, for on-route vessels further anomalies are detected such as â€œspeed anomalyâ€ or â€œheading anomalyâ€.

"primary drivers of multidecadal spatial and temporal patterns of shoreline change derived from optical satellite imagery","2022","Understanding and predicting shoreline change along sandy coasts requires continuous (in both time and space) long-term (decades) shoreline data at good spatial (e.g. 100 s of metres) and temporal (e.g. months) resolution. Publicly available satellite imagery can now provide such time series. However, satellite-derived shorelines (SDS) are associated with uncertainties, particularly at high-energy meso-macrotidal coasts, which challenge the assessment of long-term trends and interannual variability. In this paper we address the 1984–2020 time- and space-evolution of 269 km of high-energy meso-macrotidal sandy coast in southwest France using uncertain (no tide and runup correction) SDS data. The shoreline trends are validated with field data collected over the period 2008–2019. Over 1984–2020, the shoreline eroded by 0.55 m/yr with maximum erosion (accretion) reaching 15.61 m/yr (6.94 m/yr), with the largest changes observed along coasts adjacent to the inlet and estuary mouths. We show that, away from the presence of ebb-tide deltas and swash bars affecting offshore wave transformation and nearshore circulation, the long-term shoreline trend is well explained by the gradients in longshore drift computed from a regional wave hindcast and an empirical longshore transport formula. By averaging the yearly SDS along the entire coastline, we find that interannual shoreline variability is well correlated with the winter West Europe Pressure Anomaly (WEPA), which outscores the other conventional teleconnection pattern indices. WEPA even explains >80 % of the space-averaged shoreline variability over the recent period 2014–2020 when more and higher quality satellite images are available. A more local assessment of the links between climate indices and shoreline response shows that correlation with all climate indices dramatically drops downdrift of the large-scale estuary mouths and inlets. This suggests that along this 10–20 km stretch of downdrift coast, shoreline response is controlled factors internal to the estuary mouth/inlet system. The rest of the coast is mostly controlled by factors external to the system, which are primarily the variability in winter-mean wave height correlated to winter WEPA index. Overall, we demonstrate that an adapted space-averaging of uncorrected (noisy) SDS dataset can allow addressing the time- and space variability of shoreline change and their primary drivers including large-scale climate patterns of atmospheric variability. We also advocate that such SDS analysis can be performed along any coastline in the world in order to guide future model development and application.","Internal and external controls,Chronic erosion,Inlet and estuary mouth,Wave climate indices,Interannual shoreline variability,"
"detection and geovisualization of abnormal vessel behavior from video","2021","Intelligent maritime situational awareness pursues an effective understanding of the majority of the activities related to the maritime domain (impacting the safety, security, economy, or environment), with the aid of artificial intelligence systems. Such an understanding requires the development of automated processes capable of not only detecting abnormal behavior but also of visually-representing and interpreting it. Although much progress has been made in anomaly detection and visualization using vessel self-reporting positioning data, there have been no corresponding advances using video data, despite the increasing use of cameras for maritime surveillance. In this work, we introduce a framework which goes beyond vessel tracking for anomaly detection in video, and is therefore applicable to scenes with a high density of vessels. The proposed framework detects abnormal behavior using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and interprets this knowledge using metrics derived from clustering the positions and courses provided by an independent vessel/motion detector. These detections are geovisualized using an advanced displaying tool where detected abnormal behavior may be localized on the globe, providing an infrastructure for intelligent maritime situational awareness.","generative adversarial network,surveillance,Safety,anomaly detection,Generative adversarial networks,data visualisation,Knowledge engineering,security of data,geovisualization,intelligent maritime situational awareness,marine engineering,abnormal vessel behavior,maritime surveillance,vessel self-reporting positioning data,object detection,maritime domain,Measurement,Real-time systems,video signal processing,artificial intelligence systems,Tools,artificial intelligence,Detectors,"

However, the existence of noise and the lack of target spatial shape and texture features in hyperspectral image (HSI) limit the performance of hyperspectral anomaly detection. Here, we present a novel hyperspectral anomaly detection method by local correlation fractional Fourier transform (FrFT) and vector pulse coupled neural network (VPCNN). First, combined with the correlation between local pixels, the HSI is transformed into the fractional Fourier domain through the proposed local correlation FrFT, which can suppress noise and background while preserving anomaly targets features in the HSI. Second, the VPCNN, which can effectively deal with the lack of spatial shape and texture features of the target, is proposed to segment the transformed HSI into different regions to obtain the segmentation image. Finally, anomaly detection result is extracted from the segmentation image. Experimental results on four real-world datasets show that the proposed method has better superiority and advancement compared with other state-of-the-art alternative methods. We hope that our research will inspire the application of segmentation methods in related fields.","Fractional Fourier transform,Hyperspectral anomaly detection,Hyperspectral image,Vector pulse coupled neural network,"

"permeability and voids influence on the thermal signal, as inferred by multitemporal uav-based infrared and visible images","2020","This work presents for the first time associated thermal anomalies and deformations over subsurface cavities/voids located within two harbour quays in Le Havre Harbourg, Normandy, France. An U.A.V. (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) was used to acquire visible and thermal images over a diurnal cycle (from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m.). The visible images were processed to realize an altimetric model of the platforms by mean of the photogrammetric method, while the thermal infrared (TIR) images were used to study the evolution of their surface temperatures. The obtained 3D model shows the location of five topographic depressions on both quays. The analysis of the evolution of the surface thermal field leads to the detection of cold thermal anomalies that are (1) not correlated to surface properties, and (2) spatially associated to the flanks of the five topographic depressions. Using a 2D conductive-radiative model, we show that these anomalies are not directly due to the thermally insulating effect of an air-filled area. Finally, we conclude that preferential infiltration and subsequent evaporation in the micro-fracturation present within the flanks of the depressions may be responsible for the strong cooling of these zones.","Thermal infrared,Photogrammetry,Remote Sensing,infiltration,Subsurface cavity,Natural hazards,UAV,"
"image-consistent detection of road anomalies as unpredictable patches","2023","We propose a novel method for anomaly detection primarily aiming at autonomous driving. The design of the method, called DaCUP (Detection of anomalies as Consistent Unpredictable Patches), is based on two general properties of anomalous objects: an anomaly is (i) not from a class that could be modelled and (ii) it is not similar (in appearance) to non-anomalous objects in the image. To this end, we propose a novel embedding bottleneck in an auto-encoder like architecture that enables modelling of a diverse, multi-modal known class appearance (e.g. road). Secondly, we introduce novel image-conditioned distance features that allow known class identification in a nearest-neighbour manner on-the-fly, greatly increasing its ability to distinguish true and false positives. Lastly, an inpainting module is utilized to model the uniqueness of detected anomalies and significantly reduce false positives by filtering regions that are similar, thus reconstructable from their neighbourhood. We demonstrate that filtering of regions based on their similarity to neighbour regions, using e.g. an inpainting module, is general and can be used with other methods for reduction of false positives. The proposed method is evaluated on several publicly available datasets for road anomaly detection and on a maritime benchmark for obstacle avoidance. The method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both tasks with the same hyper-parameters with no domain specific design.","Benchmark testing,anomalous objects,road anomaly detection,Feature extraction,detection of anomalies as consistent unpredictable patches,Design methodology,Filtering,nearest-neighbour manner,nonanomalous objects,object detection,feature extraction,multimodal known class appearance,inpainting module,autonomous driving,domain specific design,nearest neighbour methods,Roads,image-consistent detection,mobile robots,image restoration,DaCUP,Task analysis,auto-encoder,Algorithms: Image recognition and understanding (object detection,obstacle avoidance,Computer vision,road vehicles,categorization,image-conditioned distance features,class identification,segmentation),"
"continuous monitoring of land disturbance based on landsat time series","2020","We developed a new algorithm for COntinuous monitoring of Land Disturbance (COLD) using Landsat time series. COLD can detect many kinds of land disturbance continuously as new images are collected and provide historical land disturbance maps retrospectively. To better detect land disturbance, we tested different kinds of input data and explored many time series analysis techniques. We have several major observations as follows. First, time series of surface reflectance provides much better detection results than time series of Top-Of-Atmosphere (TOA) reflectance, and with some adjustments to the temporal density, time series from Landsat Analysis Ready Data (ARD) is better than it is from the same Landsat scene. Second, the combined use of spectral bands is always better than using a single spectral band or index, and if all the essential spectral bands have been employed, the inclusion of other indices does not further improve the algorithm performance. Third, the remaining outliers in the time series can be removed based on their deviation from model predicted values based on probability-based thresholds derived from normal or chi-squared distributions. Fourth, model initialization is pivotal for monitoring land disturbance, and a good initialization stability test can influence algorithm performance substantially. Fifth, time series model estimation with eight coefficients model, updated for every single observation, based on all available clear observations achieves the best result. Sixth, a change probability of 0.99 (chi-squared distribution) with six consecutive anomaly observations and a mean included angle < 45° to confirm a change provide the best results, and the combined use of temporally-adjusted Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and minimum RMSE is recommended. Finally, spectral changes (or “breaks”) contributed from vegetation regrowth should be excluded from land disturbance maps. The COLD algorithm was developed and calibrated based on all these lessons learned above. The accuracy assessment shows that COLD results were accurate for detecting land disturbance, with an omission error of 27% and a commission error of 28%.","Landsat,Time series,COLD,Change detection,Near real-time,Land disturbance,"

"bayesian filtering for dynamic anomaly detection and tracking","2022","This article presents a Bayesian approach for sequential detection of anomalies in the motion of a target and joint tracking. The anomaly is modeled as a binary (on/off) switching unknown control input that goes into action (begins to exist, or â€œswitches onâ€) thereby modifying the object dynamics; and by ceasing its activity (becoming nonexistent, or â€œswitching offâ€) returns the dynamics to nominal. The developed Bayesian framework brings together random finite set (RFS) theory to represent the switching nature of the anomaly, and optimal joint input and state estimation to sequentially update a hybrid state that incorporates a random vector for the kinematic state and a Bernoulli RFS for the unknown control input. In addition, a closed-form solution, the Gaussian-mixture hybrid Bernoulli filter (GM-HBF), has been developed to provide a customized solution for dynamic anomaly detection in the maritime domain characterized by linear Gaussian target dynamics. Based on the Ornsteinâ€“Uhlenbeck dynamic model for vessels, where the evolution of the object velocity is governed by a piecewise mean-reverting stochastic process, the anomaly can be represented by a change in the long-run mean velocity (i.e., the unknown control input) from the nominal condition that forces the vessel to deviate from its standard route. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed GM-HBF in both simulated and real-world maritime surveillance applications and test its performance in the face of false measurements, detection uncertainty, and sensor data gaps.","developed Bayesian framework,surveillance,kinematic state,Mathematical models,Anomaly detection,Automatic identification system (AIS),Bayesian approach,random finite sets (RFSs),Bayesian filtering,Bayes methods,object dynamics,linear Gaussian target dynamics,Switches,Bernoulli filter,switching unknown control input,Radio frequency,target tracking,Aerodynamics,stochastic processes,filtering theory,radar,state estimation,detection uncertainty,Gaussian processes,Bernoulli RFS,Radar tracking,maritime anomaly detection,dynamic anomaly detection,joint input and state estimation (JISE),probability,Ornstein-Uhlenbeck dynamic model,GM-HBF,Gaussian-mixture hybrid Bernoulli filter,"

"magmatic degassing, lava dome extrusion, and explosions from mount cleveland volcano, alaska, 2011–2015: insight into the continuous nature of volcanic activity over multi-year timescales","2017","Mount Cleveland volcano (1730m) is one of the most active volcanoes in the Aleutian arc, Alaska, but heightened activity is rarely accompanied by geophysical signals, which makes interpretation of the activity difficult. In this study, we combine volcanic gas emissions measured for the first time in August 2015 with longer-term measurements of thermal output and lava extrusion rates between 2011 and 2015 calculated from MODIS satellite data with the aim to develop a better understanding of the nature of volcanic activity at Mount Cleveland. Degassing measurements were made in the month following two explosive events (21 July and 7 August 2015) and during a period of new dome growth in the summit crater. SO2 emission rates ranged from 400 to 860td−1 and CO2/SO2 ratios were <3, consistent with the presence of shallow magma in the conduit and the observed growth of a new lava dome. Thermal anomalies derived from MODIS data from 2011 to 2015 had an average repose time of only 4days, pointing to the continuous nature of volcanic activity at this volcano. Rapid increases in the cumulative thermal output were often coincident with visual confirmation of dome growth or accumulations of tephra in the crater. The average rate of lava extrusion calculated for 9 periods of rapid increase in thermal output was 0.28m3s−1, and the total volume extruded from 2011 to 2015 was 1.9–5.8Mm3. The thermal output from the lava extrusion events only accounts for roughly half of the thermal budget, suggesting a continued presence of shallow magma in the upper conduit, likely driven by convection. Axisymmetric dome morphology and occasional drain back of lava into the conduit suggests low-viscosity magmas drive volcanism at Mount Cleveland. It follows also that only small overpressures can be maintained given the small domes and fluid magmas, which is consistent with the low explosivity of most of Mount Cleveland's eruptions. Changes between phases of dome growth and explosive activity are somewhat unpredictable and likely result from plugs that are related to the dome obtaining a critical dimension, or from small variations in the magma ascent rate that lead to crystallization-induced blockages in the upper conduit, thereby reducing the ability of magma to degas. We suggest the small magma volumes, slow ascent rates, and low magma viscosity lead to the overall lack of anomalous geophysical signals prior to eruptions, and that more continuous volcanic degassing measurements might lead to more successful eruption forecasting at this continuously-active open-vent volcano.","Degassing,Mount Cleveland volcano,Extrusion rate,Explosion,Magma flux,Open vent,Dome growth,"
"underwater archaeological investigation using ground penetrating radar: a case analysis of shanglinhu yue kiln sites (china)","2018","In this study we explored the possibility and effectiveness of applying ground penetrating radar (GPR) to investigate underwater cultural relics. Using this innovative technique, the remains of Yue kiln and anomalous objects buried beneath the lake or suspended in the water can now be fully studied. Although GPR has been widely used for imaging archaeological sites, skepticism remains over its use in underwater archaeology. Nevertheless, some scholars suggest that it is possible to use GPR to detect underwater remains, which has been further confirmed by the use of electrical parameter measurement (EPM) in Shanglinhu Lake. An experiment was performed by our team using antennas of different frequencies in a particular area of the lake. The results showed that the penetrability of the 100 MHz antenna was enough to examine the targets, while the 400 MHz antenna performed well in shallow water (depth <4 m) due to higher resolution. Hence, for our underwater investigation, we used both antennas for maximum coverage. We used a radargram as a topographic map which shows cross sections of the lake. Analysis of the Shanglinhu Lake data indicated that GPR is a superior tool for underwater archaeological investigation. Traditional methods including sonar, underwater cameras and salvage dives were used as supporting techniques in the study.","Underwater archaeological investigation,Ground penetrating radar,Yue kiln remains,"
"attacking (and defending) the maritime radar system","2023","The operation of radar equipment is one of the key facilities navigators use to gather situational awareness about their surroundings. With an ever-increasing need for always-running logistics and tighter shipping schedules, operators rely more on computerized instruments and their indications. As a result, modern ships have become complex cyber-physical systems in which sensors and computers constantly communicate and coordinate. In this work, we discuss novel threats related to the radar system, one of a shipâ€™s most security-sensitive components. In detail, we first discuss some new attacks capable of compromising the integrity of data displayed on a radar system, with potentially catastrophic impacts on the crewâ€™s situational awareness or safety. Then, we present a detection system to highlight anomalies in the radar video feed, requiring no modifications to the target ship configuration. Finally, we stimulate our detection system by performing the attacks inside a simulated environment. The experimental results indicate that the attacks are feasible, easy to carry out, and hard to detect. Moreover, they prove that the proposed detection technique is effective.","computer network security,detection system,tighter shipping schedules,Radar antennas,complex cyber-physical systems,radar equipment,security-sensitive components,Marine vehicles,Radar equipment,target ship configuration,cyber-physical systems,marine navigation,security of data,radar video feed,logistics,computerized instruments,key facilities navigators,Standards,ships,sensors,situational awareness,Radar,modern ships,crew,maritime radar system,Navigation,network security,Radar detection,"
"belief modeling for maritime surveillance","2009","In maritime surveillance, the volume of information to be processed is very large and there is a great deal of uncertainty about the data. There are many vessels at sea at every point in time, and the vast majority of them pose no threat to security. Sifting through all of the benign activity to find unusual activities is a difficult problem. The problem is made even more difficult by the fact that the available data about vessel activities is both incomplete and inconsistent. In order to manage this uncertainty, automated anomaly detection software can be very useful in the early detection of threats to security. This paper introduces a high-level architecture for an anomaly detection system based on a formal model of beliefs with respect to each entity in some domain of interest. In this framework, the system has beliefs about the intentions of each vessel in the maritime domain. If the vessel behaves in an unexpected manner, these intentions are revised and a human operations centre worker is notified. This approach is flexible, scalable, and easily manages inconsistent information. Moreover, the approach has the pragmatic advantage that it uses expert information to inform decision making, but the required information is easily obtained through simple ranking exercises.","surveillance,Anomaly detection,automated anomaly detection software,Marine vehicles,Monitoring,security of data,Decision making,Information security,data uncertainty,belief modeling,Application software,marine engineering,maritime surveillance,Humans,Radar tracking,decision making,high-level architecture,belief revision,Uncertainty,Surveillance,Data security,"
"context-enhanced vessel prediction based on ornstein-uhlenbeck processes using historical ais traffic patterns: real-world experimental results","2014","Traffic route analysis and prediction are both essential for maritime security. Specifically, the prediction of a vessel position is useful to provide alerts about upcoming events (e.g., opportunities and threats). However, accurate prediction along a route in the maritime domain is a challenging task, due to the complex and dynamic nature of traffic patterns. This paper presents a vessel prediction method, based on the popular Ornstein-Uhlenbeck stochastic processes, whose parameters are estimated from historical patterns of life. The historical traffic routes are obtained by pre-processing Automatic Identification System (AIS) data via the CMRE tool called Traffic Route Extraction for Anomaly Detection (TREAD). These recurrent routes allow prediction of the position of a vessel that is following one of these routes, surprisingly, by several hours. The method is validated using a case study related to the second data campaign of the EC FP7 Project New Service Capabilities for Integrated and Advanced Maritime Surveillance (NEREIDS)1. We demonstrate that the prediction accuracy is well represented by the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model.","surveillance,New Service Capabilities for Integrated and Advanced Maritime Surveillance,anomaly detection,security of data,Stochastic processes,Predictive models,Transmitters,historical AIS traffic pattern,vessel position prediction uncertainty,context enhanced vessel prediction method,NEREIDS,automatic identification system,CMRE tool,stochastic processes,marine engineering,Target tracking,maritime domain,Radar tracking,Real-time systems,Ornstein-Uhlenbeck stochastic process,traffic route extraction,traffic engineering computing,parameter estimation,Data mining,traffic route analysis,EC FP7 Project,"

Two multi-institutional, multi-instrument campaigns, one under ‘Space Weather: Science and Applications’ and the other emphasizing tides under ‘Atmospheric Coupling Processes’ were conducted during February–April 2006. The highlights of the campaigns include improved prediction of equatorial spread-F (ESF) based on a ‘new factor’ combining the strength and asymmetry of the equatorial ionization anomaly (EIA); simultaneous detection of quasi-2-day wave at both E and F region heights; tomographic image showing a Traveling Ionospheric Disturbance (TID) in association with a counter electrojet (CEJ) event—all highlighting the neutral and electrodynamical coupling of the equatorial ionosphere−thermosphere regions; an unusual lowering of mesospheric temperature during a moderate geomagnetic storm—highlighting a new space weather effect; diurnal tide showing a peak amplitude of 35m/s at 45km in zonal wind and a significantly lower amplitude (∼15m/s) in the meridional wind and also evidence of convective activity in the lower atmosphere influencing the tidal variability in the Mesosphere−Lower Thermosphere (MLT) region highlighting the vertical coupling of the atmospheric regions. The development of models for equatorial and low latitude ionosphere has been among the prime activities taken up under ‘Space Climate’. Two models have been developed towards this end: one based on Second Degree (SD) relationships of F region parameters to the mean sun spot number and the other a Multiple Regression Analysis (MRA) based model involving expressions relating F region parameters to that representing solar and geomagnetic activities. The two models, intended for long and short term predictions, have been found to represent the equatorial and low latitude ionosphere over Indian longitudes better than the commonly used International Reference Ionosphere (IRI). Under the theme of ‘Solar Influence on Atmospheric Climate’, a study has been made on the effects of solar variability on middle atmosphere using satellite data and model simulations, highlighting the significant differences between them.","Ionosphere,Magnetosphere,CAWSES,Stratosphere–troposphere,Solarwind,Mesosphere,Thermosphere,"

"deep learning aided beam vector assignment for massive mimo maritime communication considering location information and handover impact","2022","Location aided beamforming (LAB) has been proposed as a potential solution to fast beam vector (BV) selection for massive multi-input multi-output (M-MIMO) maritime communication systems. However, the existing LAB schemes hardly consider the impact from handover. In this paper, we propose to apply the Gaussian anomaly detection (GAD) to improve the system performance, particularly in the handover zone, by exploiting the information of sea lane and locations of the user equipment (UE). Furthermore, inspired by the rationale of deep learning (DL) aided image processing methods, we first transform the BV assignment problem to a location-based artificial gray value classification problem, and then utilize a convolutional deep belief networks (CDBN) to predict the BV indices from a predefined codebook constituted by location-related feature matrices. In addition, we exploit GAD to rectify the training data of CDBN, such that the prediction on BV assignments can be more accurate to achieve a higher capacity than known methods. Finally, an extensive comparison with selected existing schemes through simulations demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.","Convolutional deep belief network (CDBN),Maritime communication,Deep learning (DL),Massive multiple input multiple output (M-MIMO),Gaussian anomaly detection (GAD),"

By observing vessel tracks, the behavior can be derived from the driven maneuvers of a vessel. Extracting maneuvers out of historical observation data (e.g. AIS) is an important task.

"ais-based maritime anomaly traffic detection: a review","2023","Maritime transportation plays an essential role in global trade. Due to the huge number of vessels worldwide, there is also a non-negligible volume of Maritime incidents such as collisions/sinking and illegal events (e.g., piracy, smuggling, and unauthorized fishing). Electronic equipment/systems, such as radars and Automatic Identification Systems (AIS), have contributed to improving maritime situational awareness. AIS provides one of the fundamental sources of vessel kinematics and static data. Today, many approaches are focused on automatically detecting the vessels’ traffic behavior and discovering useful patterns and deviations from those data. These studies contribute to detecting suspicious activities and anomalous trajectories, whose developed techniques could be applied in the surveillance systems, helping the authorities to anticipate proper actions. Several concerns and difficulties are involved in the analyses of vessel kinematics data: how to deal with big data generated, inconsistencies, irregular updates, dynamic data, unlabeled data, and evaluation.

However, AIS can be subject to intentional reporting of false information, or â€œspoofingâ€.

Multiple hypothesis testing suggests a framework to enlist reliable information from monitoring systems (coastal radars and space-born satellite sensors) in support of detection of anomalies, spoofing, and stealth deviations.

Ship performance and navigation data of a selected vessel are analyzed, where various data anomalies, i.e. sensor related erroneous data conditions, are identified. Those erroneous data conditions are investigated and several approaches to isolate such situations are also presented by considering appropriate data visualization methods. Then, the cleaned data are used to derive various relationships among ship performance and navigation parameters that have been visualized in this study, appropriately. The results show that the wind profiles along ship routes can be used to evaluate vessel performance and navigation conditions by assuming the respective sea states relate to their wind conditions. Hence, the results are useful to derive appropriate mathematical models that represent ship performance and navigation conditions. Such mathematical models can be used for weather routing type applications (i.e. voyage planning), where the respective weather forecast can be used to derive optimal ship routes to improve vessel performance and reduce fuel consumption. This study presents not only an overview of statistical data analysis of ship performance and navigation data but also the respective challenges in data anomalies (i.e. erroneous data intervals and sensor faults) due to onboard sensors and data handling systems. Furthermore, the respective solutions to such challenges in data quality have also been presented by considering data visualization approaches.","Speed power performance,Data anomaly detection,Sensor fault identification,Weather routing,Ship wind profile,Statistical data analysis,"
"deep learning to enhance maritime situation awareness","2019","Maritime surveillance sensors like AIS (Automatic Identification System) and Radar provide useful information for decision-making support, which is of paramount importance for effective operations against maritime threats and illegal activities [1]. However, decision-making systems that trust solely on AIS information tend to fail in real situations because such information could be missing, inaccurate or even deceptive [2]. On the other hand, only Radar information is not enough to get a complete description of the maritime situational picture. This paper proposes a deep learning framework for vessel monitoring that examines a particular scenario where a deep learning solution can infer a navigation status based on the vessels trajectories, and thus to detect suspicious vessels activities. For this purpose, a dataset, named DeepMarine, has been specifically created by collecting data of AIS historical recordings.

"lithological and alteration mineral mapping in poorly exposed lithologies using landsat-8 and aster satellite data: north-eastern graham land, antarctic peninsula","2019","Antarctica remains a remote and logistically difficult region to conduct geological field mapping and mineral exploration. Remote sensing satellite imagery has high potential to provide a solution to overcome the difficulties and limitations associated with geological field mapping and mineral exploration in inaccessible regions. In this study, the applications of Landsat-8 and the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) data were investigated to extract geological information for lithological and alteration mineral mapping in poorly exposed lithologies located in inaccessible regions. The north-eastern Graham Land, Antarctic Peninsula (AP) was selected in this study to conduct a satellite-based remote sensing mapping approach. A two-stage methodology was adopted to distinguish pixel and sub-pixel targets in the satellite images. In the first stage, Continuum Removal (CR) spectral mapping tool and Independent Components Analysis (ICA) technique were applied to Landsat-8 and ASTER spectral bands to map the pixels related to poorly exposed lithological units. The second step was established based on the application of target detection algorithms to shortwave infrared bands of ASTER for detecting spectral features attributed to alteration mineral assemblages at the sub-pixel level. Pixels composed of distinctive absorption features of alteration mineral assemblages and Si-O bond emission minima features were detected by applying CR mapping tool to reflective and thermal bands of Landsat-8 and ASTER. Anomaly pixels related to spectral features of Al-O–H, Fe, Mg-O–H and CO3 groups as well as lithological attributions from felsic to mafic rocks were detected by the implementation of ICA technique to reflective and thermal bands of Landsat-8 and ASTER. ICA method provided image maps of alteration mineral assemblages and lithological units (mafic to felsic trend) for poorly mapped and/or unmapped regions. Fractional abundance of alteration minerals such as muscovite, kaolinite, illite, montmorillonite, epidote, chlorite and biotite were detected in poorly exposed lithologies using target detection algorithms. Several prospecting areas for Cu, Mo, Au and Ag mineralization related to propyllitically and argillically altered units of Andean Intrusive Suite (AIS) were identified in the southern sector of the study region. The results of this investigation demonstrated the applicability of Landsat-8 and ASTER spectral data for lithological and alteration mineral mapping in poorly exposed lithologies located in inaccessible regions, particularly using the image processing algorithms that are capable of detecting anomaly pixels and sub-pixel targets in the remotely sensed images, where no prior information is available. In conclusion, a simple and robust satellite-based remote sensing approach for mapping poorly exposed lithologies in inaccessible regions was established, which is comprehensively applicable for lithological and alteration mineral mapping in the Antarctic environments and hydrothermal ore minerals prospecting in other inaccessible regions around the world.","Inaccessible regions,Landsat-8,Antarctic Peninsula,Graham Land,Poorly exposed lithologies,ASTER,Satellite-based remote sensing approach,"

Although some efforts have been made to distinguish the faults and malfunctions (fault detection) that can occur in marine systems, the implementation of fault identification to provide a description of any considered fault type and its nature is still an unexplored area due to the lack of fault data. To overcome this, a methodology for the identification of anomalies in marine systems is presented in this paper.

"anomaly based sea-surface small target detection using k-nearest neighbor classification","2020","Sea-surface small target detection is always a difficult problem in high-resolution maritime ubiquitous radars for complex characteristics of sea clutter, weak target returns, and diversity of targets. Multiple features extracted from radar returns in different domains have ability but not enough to solely distinguish radar returns with target from sea clutter. Joint exploitation of multiple features becomes the key to improve detection performance. In this article, the K-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm and anomaly detection idea are cooperated to develop a novel sea-surface target detection method in the feature space spanned by the eight existing salient features. The detection is realized by the anomaly detection followed by a specially designed KNN-based classifier with a controllable false alarm rate. In the anomaly detection, a decision region is determined by the hyper-spherical coverage of the training set of sea clutter that is sufficient and ergodic in the feature space.

The novel method is validated by the two open and recognized IPIX and CSIR radar databases for sea-surface small target detection.

"filament formation and evolution in buoyant coastal waters: observation and modelling","2012","This paper presents a detailed analysis of the formation and subsequent evolution of filament-like structures observed in a relatively small area of the mid-Tyrrhenian Sea (Mediterranean Sea). The filament dynamics and potential impact on the cross-shelf exchange budget are investigated based on a combined use of remote sensing imagery, in situ data and numerical modelling. The complexity of these phenomena is shown by focusing on four distinct events that led to cross-shelf transport, each representative of a different dynamic process and a distinct expected impact on the coastal area. A systematic analysis of available observations for the years 1998–2006 underlines the role of the interplay of atmospheric freshwater fluxes, river loads and wind stress variations, which may create favourable conditions for the convergence of shelf waters (particularly at coastal capes) and the subsequent formation of short-lived filaments along the coast. The response of the buoyant coastal waters to periods of wind reversal and fluctuating freshwater discharge rates is examined through idealised Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) simulations. The filaments observed in remote sensing imagery were well reproduced by the numerical exercise, where the filaments appear as organised submesoscale structures that possess high relative vorticity and develop at the river mouths or adjacent capes. In both scenarios, the filaments appear largely determined by (i) the presence of a buoyancy anomaly, (ii) the angle between the wind pulse direction and the coast and (iii) irregularities in the coastal profile. The ensemble of results suggests that the occurrence of such transient, intense structures may contribute considerably to the biological variability and cross-shelf exchange in coastal areas with similar traits.",""
"a novel approach exploiting properties of convolutional neural networks for vessel movement anomaly detection and classification","2022","The article concerns the automation of vessel movement anomaly detection for maritime and coastal traffic safety services. Deep Learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), were used to solve this problem. Three variants of the datasets, containing samples of vessel traffic routes in relation to the prohibited area in the form of a grayscale image, were generated. 1458 convolutional neural networks with different structures were trained to find the best structure to classify anomalies. The influence of various parameters of network structures on the overall accuracy of classification was examined. For the best networks, class prediction rates were examined. Activations of selected convolutional layers were studied and visualized to present how the network works in a friendly and understandable way. The best convolutional neural network for detecting vessel movement anomalies has been proposed.

MLNs combine the expressive power of first-order logic and the probabilistic uncertainty management of Markov networks. Within this framework, different types of knowledge (e.g. a priori, contextual) with associated uncertainty can be fused together for situation assessment by expressing unobservable complex events as a logical combination of simpler evidences. We also develop a mechanism to evaluate the level of completion of complex events and show how, along with event probability, it could provide additional useful information to the operator.

"a remote sensing and gis based investigation of a boreal forest coal fire","2011","A coal seam fire in interior Alaska was suspected to have started the Rex Creek forest fire in the summer of 2009. With prevailing winds, the forest fire spread rapidly to the north and within eleven days it burned about 410km2 of boreal forest. Coal seam fires can go unnoticed and unreported when present in remote and inaccessible areas. However, they still pose a serious threat to the surroundings. We used summer-time thermal infrared images from 1999 through 2009 acquired by the Landsat satellite and, through the process of image stacking, identified a region where the surface persistently showed temperatures 5°C to 14°C higher than the background areas. Field validation confirmed that this thermal anomaly area corresponds to a previously undocumented shallow coal seam fire. Superimposing the boundary of the Rex Creek forest fire revealed that the coal seam fire was at the southern end of the burn area where the forest fire originated. Plotting the location of all lightning strikes during this period helped to rule out lightning as the cause of the forest fire. Coal fires and forest fires can have a complex and dynamic relationship, one being the possible cause of the other. A thorough inventory of all past and present known coal seam fire locations can help to update forest fire hazard maps. A detailed map of shallow coal seam areas can help to prioritize fire fighting operations in order to avoid the chance of starting a new coal seam fire.","Forest fire,Remote sensing,Boreal forest,Coal fire,GIS,"
"interval prediction of vessel trajectory based on lower and upper bound estimation and attention-modified lstm with bayesian optimization","2023","Uncertainty prediction of vessel trajectory is essential to enhance maritime situational awareness and traffic safety. Traditional approaches for trajectory prediction face challenges in accurately quantifying uncertainties, thereby limiting effectiveness in decision-making. To address this challenge, we propose a hybrid interval prediction frame of vessel trajectory using the lower and upper bound estimation (LUBE) and attention-modified long short-term memory (LSTM) network with bayesian optimization (BO). Firstly, trajectory data is preprocessed to solve the scale irregularity. Then, a novel trajectory interval prediction model for perceiving the prediction uncertainties is designed based on an advanced attention-modified LSTM with interval prediction capability. Meanwhile, a supervised training strategy with differentiating the interval widths of latitude and longitude is put forward to devise sample labels for training the model. Additionally, a new prediction interval-based objective function is proposed considering the target of maximizing coverage and minimizing width of trajectory interval. The BO algorithm optimizes the weighted parameters in the LSTM network by minimizing the objective function value. Finally, cases from two water areas are implemented to test and verify the proposed method. The results illustrate the superiority of the proposed approach in (1) outperforming other methods used for comparison in both coverage probability and width criteria of prediction interval. (2) quantifying the prediction uncertainty and improving the reliability of trajectory predictor. (3) performing anomaly detection tasks using visualized trajectory prediction intervals. The research can help maritime traffic participants obtain more reliable trajectory data, which supports making more reasonable traffic supervision decisions.","Long short-term memory,Attention mechanism,Vessel trajectory,Lower and upper bound estimation (LUBE),Interval prediction,"
"coastal sar and plrm altimetry in german bight and west baltic sea","2018","Unlike previous altimetric missions, the CryoSat-2 altimeter features a novel Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) mode that allows higher resolution and more accurate altimeter-derived parameters in the coastal zone, thanks to the reduced along-track footprint. The scope of this study is to quantify regionally the skills of CryoSat-2 SAR altimetry for distances to coast smaller than 10 km, during the mission lifetime and at different time scales. The validated geophysical altimeter parameters are the sea surface height above the ellipsoid, the significant sea wave height and wind speed, all computed at 20 Hz. These have been compared to in situ and regional model data along the coasts of German Bight and West Baltic Sea during a time interval of almost six years, from July 2010 to March 2016, to investigate both instantaneous and seasonal behaviour. From CryoSat-2 FBR (Full Bit Rate) data, a Delay-Doppler processing and waveform retracking tailored specifically to the coastal zone has been carried out, by applying a Hamming window and zero-padding, using an extended vertical swath window in order to mitigate tracker errors. Moreover, a dedicated SAMOSA-based coastal retracker (here referred to as SAMOSA+) has also been implemented. Since one of the highest remaining uncertainties in the altimeter parameters estimated in coastal shallow waters arises from residual errors in the applied range and geophysical corrections, innovative and high resolution solutions for ocean tide model, geoid, mean sea surface and wet tropospheric correction have been selected. As CryoSat-2 SAR and LRM (Low Rate Mode) modes are not collocated in time, in order to quantify the improvement in the coastal zone with respect to pulse-limited altimetry, 20 Hz PLRM (pseudo-LRM) data from CryoSat-2 FBR were built and retracked, adopting the ALES adaptive sub-waveform approach, with a numerical Brown-based retracker, here referred to as TALES. The cross-validation proves the good consistency between PLRM and SAR sea level anomaly in the coastal zone. The regional ocean model (BSH) shows the highest agreement with the SAR sea level anomaly, with a standard deviation of the differences (stdd) of 24 cm, whereas the corresponding value with respect to PLRM is 55 cm. Distance to coast plots show that land contamination begins to affect sea level and wave measurements at 2 km from the coast in SAR and at 3.5 km in PLRM TALES. The analysis of monthly mean time-series shows that SAR Altimetry is able to measure the sea level monthly mean in the coastal zone of the region of interest, during the entire mission, more precisely than PLRM. The cross-validation against in situ data also proves the higher accuracy of SAR SAMOSA+ compared to PLRM TALES in the coastal zone, with average SLA stdd of 4.4 cm and 8.4 cm respectively.","Sea level,SAR altimetry,CryoSat-2,Coastal altimetry,Retracking,In situ validation,"
"grid size optimization for potential field based maritime anomaly detection","2014","This study focuses on improving the potential field based maritime data modeling method, developed to extract traffic patterns and detect anomalies, in a clear, understandable and informative way. The method's novelty lies in employing the concept of a potential field for AIS vessel tracking data abstraction and maritime traffic representation. Unlike the traditional maritime surveillance equipment, such as radar or GPS, the AIS system comprehensively represents the identity and properties of a vessel, as well as its behavior, thus preserving the effects of navigational decisions, based on the skills of experienced seamen. In the developed data modeling process, every vessel generates potential charges, which value represent the vessel's behavior, and drops the charges at locations it passes. Each AIS report is used to assign a potential charge at the reported vessel positions. The method derives three construction elements, which define, firstly, how charges are accumulated, secondly, how a charge decays over time, and thirdly, in what way the potential is distributed around the source charge. The collection of potential fields represents a model of normal behavior, and vessels not conforming to it are marked as anomalous. In the anomaly detection prototype system STRAND, the sensitivity of anomaly detection can be modified by setting a geographical coordinate grid precision to more dense or coarse. The objective of this study is to identify the optimal grid size for two different conditions – an open sea and a port area case. A noticeable shift can be observed between the results for the open sea and the port area. The plotted detection rates converge towards an optimal ratio for smaller grid sizes in the port area (60-200 meters), than in the open sea case (300-1000 meters). The effective outcome of the potential filed based anomaly detection is filtering out all vessels behaving normally and presenting a set of anomalies, for a subsequent incident analysis using STRAND as an information visualization tool.","maritime traffic,potential field,anomaly detection,AIS,"

"aed-net: an abnormal event detection network","2019","It has long been a challenging task to detect an anomaly in a crowded scene. In this paper, a self-supervised framework called the abnormal event detection network (AED-Net), which is composed of a principal component analysis network (PCAnet) and kernel principal component analysis (kPCA), is proposed to address this problem. Using surveillance video sequences of different scenes as raw data, the PCAnet is trained to extract high-level semantics of the crowd’s situation. Next, kPCA, a one-class classifier, is trained to identify anomalies within the scene. In contrast to some prevailing deep learning methods, this framework is completely self-supervised because it utilizes only video sequences of a normal situation. Experiments in global and local abnormal event detection are carried out on Monitoring Human Activity dataset from University of Minnesota (UMN dataset) and Anomaly Detection dataset from University of California, San Diego (UCSD dataset), and competitive results that yield a better equal error rate (EER) and area under curve (AUC) than other state-of-the-art methods are observed. Furthermore, by adding a local response normalization (LRN) layer, we propose an improvement to the original AED-Net. The results demonstrate that this proposed version performs better by promoting the framework’s generalization capacity.","Kernel principal component analysis,Abnormal events detection,Principal component analysis network,Abnormal event detection network,"

"detecting anomalous deviations from standard maritime routes using the ornsteinâ€“uhlenbeck process","2018","A novel anomaly detection procedure based on the Ornsteinâ€“Uhlenbeck (OU) mean-reverting stochastic process is presented. The considered anomaly is a vessel that deviates from a planned route, changing its nominal velocity $\boldsymbol{v}_0$. In order to hide this behavior, the vessel switches off its automatic identification system (AIS) device for a time  $T$ and then tries to revert to the previous nominal velocity $\boldsymbol{v}_0$. The decision that has to be made is declaring that a deviation either happened or not, relying only upon two consecutive AIS contacts. Furthermore, the extension to the scenario in which multiple contacts (e.g., radar) are available during the time period $T$ is also considered. A proper statistical hypothesis testing procedure that builds on the changes in the OU process long-term velocity parameter $\boldsymbol{v}_0$ of the vessel is the core of the proposed approach and enables the solution of the anomaly detection problem.

"identifying industrial heat sources using time-series of the viirs nightfire product with an object-oriented approach","2018","Carbon-based fuels burned at industrial facilities account for a large proportion of greenhouse gas emissions, and an up-to-date spatiotemporally detailed inventory is essential for a better understanding of global carbon emission patterns. The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Nightfire product offers a quantitative estimation of the temperatures of sub-pixel heat sources, providing the potential for detecting thermal anomalies from industrial sectors across the globe. However, identifying subcategories of various industrial heat sources is challenging because there are scarcely any stable and typical characteristics for their classification at a single thermal anomaly scale. Specifically, these nighttime thermal anomalies exhibit a strong spatiotemporal heterogeneity (e.g., fluctuations in retrieved temperature, spatial shifts in position, and presence of false positives), even in industrial heat sources that do not vary through time. Here, we demonstrate an object-oriented approach to robustly segment and accurately classify various industrial heat sources from a time-series of the VIIRS Nightfire product. The approach operates from the cluster level of spatially adjacent nighttime thermal anomalies (i.e., nighttime-heat-source objects rather than individual thermal anomalies) to generate fingerprint-like characteristics and to address the challenge of spatiotemporal heterogeneity. Specifically, the spatial-aggregation characteristic of nighttime thermal anomalies from continuously operating industrial heat sources and the temporal-aggregation characteristics of biomass burnings were incorporated to differentiate industrial nighttime-heat-source objects from ubiquitous biomass burnings. Subsequently, the similarity of the thermal signals of nighttime thermal anomalies from identical industrial heat sources was used to generate highly recognizable characteristics for their identification. A spatiotemporally detailed inventory of industrial heat sources across the globe was then established from this object-oriented classification. The inventory included a total of 15,199 industrial heat sources, representing 49.52% of all higher confidence nighttime thermal anomalies in the VIIRS Nightfire product. Validation of the results showed that only 218 objects (1.43%) were biomass burnings or active volcanoes that were misclassified as industrial heat sources. Further validation of sub-categories indicated an overall classification accuracy of ~77%. Our findings suggest that the VIIRS Nightfire product has great potential for monitoring the global distribution and dynamics of industrial heat sources, and combined with the object-oriented approach developed here the methodology is simple, robust, and cost-effective.","Nightfire product,Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS),Object-oriented analysis,Identification,Industrial heat sources,Time-series,"

"manifold learning techniques for unsupervised anomaly detection","2018","Appropriately identifying outlier data is a critical requirement in the decision-making process of many expert and intelligent systems deployed in a variety of fields including finance, medicine, and defense. Classical outlier detection schemes typically rely on the assumption that normal/background data of interest are distributed according to an assumed statistical model and search for data that deviate from that assumption. However, it is frequently the case that performance is reduced because the underlying distribution does not follow the assumed model. Manifold learning techniques offer improved performance by learning better models of the background but can be too computationally expensive due to the need to calculate a distance measure between all data points. Here, we study a general framework that allows manifold learning techniques to be used for unsupervised anomaly detection by reducing computational expense via a uniform random sampling of a small fraction of the data. A background manifold is learned from the sample and then an out-of-sample extension is used to project unsampled data into the learned manifold space and construct an anomaly detection statistic based on the prediction error of the learned manifold. The method works well for unsupervised anomaly detection because, by definition, the ratio of anomalous to non-anomalous data points is small and the sampling will be dominated by background points. However, a variety of parameters that affect detection performance are introduced so we use here a low-dimensional toy problem to investigate their effect on the performance of four learning algorithms (kernel PCA, two versions of diffusion map, and the Parzen density estimator). We then apply the methods to the detection of watercraft in an ensemble of 22 infrared maritime scenes where we find kernel PCA to be superior and show that it outperforms a commonly employed baseline algorithm. The framework is not limited to the tested image processing example and can be used for any unsupervised anomaly detection task.","Manifolds,Anomaly detection,Image processing,Manifold learning,Target detection,"
