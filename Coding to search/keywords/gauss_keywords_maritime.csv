"detecting infrared maritime targets overwhelmed in sun glitters by antijitter spatiotemporal saliency","2019","When detecting infrared maritime targets on sunny days, strong sun glitters can lower the detection accuracy tremendously. To this problem, we proposed a robust antijitter spatiotemporal saliency generation with parallel binarization (ASSGPB) method. Its main contribution is to facilitate to improve the infrared maritime target detection accuracy in this situation. The ASSGPB algorithm exploits the target's spatial saliency and temporal consistency to separate real targets from clutter areas. The ASSGPB first corrects image intensity distribution with a central inhibition difference of Gaussian filter. Then, a self-defined spatiotemporal saliency map (STSM) generator is used to generate an STSM in five consecutive frames while compensating interframe jitters by a joint block matching. Finally, a parallel binarization method is adopted to segment real targets in STSM while keeping full target areas. To evaluate the performance of ASSGPB, we captured eight different image sequences (20420 frames in total) that were significantly contaminated by strong sun glitters. The ASSGPB realized 100% detection rate and 0.45% false alarm rate in these data sets, greatly outperforming four state-of-the-art algorithms. Thus, a great applicability of ASSGPB has been verified through our experiments.","parallel binarization method,Spatiotemporal phenomena,Generators,target detection,spatiotemporal phenomena,image intensity distribution,Gaussian filter,ASSGPB algorithm,Sun,image matching,antijitter spatiotemporal saliency generation with parallel binarization method,maritime surveillance,object detection,infrared maritime target detection accuracy,maritime targets,Gaussian processes,STSM,jitter,image filtering,Image segmentation,infrared imaging,image sequences,infrared detectors,Jitter,Visualization,Object detection,Imaging,spatiotemporal saliency map generator,image segmentation,"
"wavelet-based texture features for the classification of age classes in a maritime pine forest","2015","This letter evaluates the potential of wavelet-based texture modeling for the classification of stand age in a managed maritime pine forest using very high resolution panchromatic and multispectral PLEIADES data. A cross-validation approach based on stand age reference data is used to compare classification performances obtained from different multivariate models (multivariate Gaussian, spherically invariant random vector (SIRV)-based models, and Gaussian copulas) and from co-occurrence matrices. Results show that the multivariate modeling of the spatial dependence of wavelet coefficients (particularly when using the Gaussian SIRV model) outperforms the use of features derived from co-occurrence matrices. Simultaneously adding features representing the color dependence and leveling the dominant orientation in anisotropic forest stands enhances the classification performances. These results confirm the ability of such wavelet-based multivariate models to efficiently capture the textural properties of very high resolution forest data and open up perspectives for their use in the mapping of monospecific forest structure variables.","Gaussian copulas,image texture analysis,Vectors,image resolution,multispectral PLEIADES data,Spatial resolution,Feature extraction,Forest structure,Image color analysis,geophysical image processing,vegetation mapping,very high resolution,maritime pine forest,spherically invariant random vector-based model,wavelet,wavelet-based texture modeling,age classes,Data models,feature extraction,image classification,image texture,Gaussian processes,stand age reference data,multivariate Gaussian model,very high resolution panchromatic data,Vegetation,cooccurrence matrices,Computational modeling,"
"maritime anomaly detection using gaussian process active learning","2012","A model of normal vessel behaviours is useful for detecting illegal, suspicious, or unsafe behaviour; such as vessel theft, drugs smuggling, people trafficking or poor sailing. This work presents a data-driven non-parametric Bayesian model, based on Gaussian Processes, to model normal shipping behaviour. This model is learned from Automatic Identification System (AIS) data and uses an Active Learning paradigm to select an informative subsample of the data to reduce the computational complexity of training. The resultant model allows a measure of normality to be calculated for each newly-observed transmission according to its velocity given its current latitude and longitude. Using this measure of normality, ships can be identified as potentially anomalous and prioritised for further investigation. The model performance is assessed by its ability to detect artificially generated AIS anomalies at locations around the United Kingdom. Finally, the model is demonstrated on case studies from artificial and real vessel data to detect anomalies in unusual tracks.","identification technology,data mining,automatic identification system data,data-driven nonparametric Bayesian model,Bayes methods,Marine vehicles,normal vessel behaviours,unsafe behaviour detection,informative data subsampling,Accuracy,illegal behaviour detection,Bayesian methods,sampling methods,real vessel data,Gaussian process active learning,United Kingdom,Data models,Gaussian processes,artificially generated AIS anomalies detection,maritime anomaly detection,artificial vessel data,training computational complexity,training,Training,behavioural sciences,computational complexity,normal shipping behaviour model,Computational modeling,suspicious behaviour detection,learning (artificial intelligence),newly-observed transmission,AIS data,"
"data transmission for maritime and land mobiles using stored channel simulation","1982","Channel simulators with synthetically generated complex multiplicative and additive Gaussian distortions are widely used for investigating non-frequency-selective fading channels. An alternative is to record the channel distortions (i.e. amplitude and phase variations) by probing the real channel and to use these stored signals to control the simulator in the lab. This stored channel method (SCM) has been applied to the following mobile radio channels â€¢ satellite to ship â€¢ SAR emergency buoy to satellite â€¢ base station to land mobile for low data rates A collection of tapes has been obtained for these channels under various conditions. They were used to compare several data transmission schemes at different data rates and various S/N-ratios, but with the same replayed fading fluctuations. The SCM was used to evaluate low rate data transmissions (< 10 Kbit/sec) with various modulation schemes such as CBPSK, digital FM, and DPSK/FM. Bit error rate results are presented. The experience with the SCM, its advantages and limitations are being discussed.","Differential quadrature phase shift keying,Data communication,Phase distortion,Fading,Fluctuations,Marine vehicles,Base stations,Satellite broadcasting,Digital modulation,Land mobile radio,"
"fusion detection algorithm of maritime radar and electro-optical pod for complex sea conditions","2023","In order to improve the perceptual capability of Unmanned Surface Vessels (USVs) in complex sea conditions, a fusion detection algorithm has been developed that combines maritime radar and electro-optical (EO) pod. This algorithm integrates the positional state of the USV, class information of the maritime target obtained through a vision-based target detection algorithm, and processed maritime radar information. By using Gaussian and morphological filtering, the fusion of position state information from the USV, EO pod data, and maritime radar data is achieved. This effectively mitigates the negative impact of environmental factors, such as waves and water mist, on target detection. A cooperative sensing process between the maritime radar and EO pod is proposed to fuse the data obtained from both sources, resulting in accurate comprehensive target information. Experimental results show that the fusion algorithm achieves an average accuracy of 80.24% and a detection rate of 74.7%, enabling precise detection of maritime targets, including their distance, speed, and category. This enhanced perceptual capability is essential for USVs operating in complex maritime environments, enabling better decision-making and navigation performance.","maritime radar data,class information,accurate comprehensive target information,sensor fusion,marine radar,electro-optical pod,vision-based target detection algorithm,fusion algorithm,enhanced perceptual capability,target detection,complex maritime environments,positional state,combines maritime radar,fusion detection algorithm,object detection,complex sea conditions,Collaboration,synergistic sensing,Surface morphology,Radar,position state information,Unmanned Surface Vessels,unmanned surface vehicles,detection rate,maritime radar information,Radar imaging,USVs operating,Object detection,Signal processing algorithms,EO pod,maritime target,multi-sensor fusion,Radar detection,"

"vessel detection and classification: an integrated maritime surveillance system in the tyrrhenian sea","2010","In recent years a number of organizations, both national and international, have put significant efforts in developing knowledge-based integrated maritime surveillance (IMS) systems. The final aim is to have a clear picture of the position, classification, identification and movement of cooperative and non-cooperative targets entering and leaving the 200 nautical miles limit of the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). Each sensor (i.e. satellite-based, ground-based, shipborne or airborne) has its own task and, in such a context, high frequency (HF) surface wave (SW) radars are inexpensive tools for long range early warning applications in open waters. They allow maximizing the effectiveness in dealing with fisheries protection, drug interdiction, illegal immigration, terrorist threats, search and rescue tasks. This paper focuses on the possibility of combining automatic identification system (AIS) data with HFSWR data for vessel detection and classification purposes. Three algorithms for target detection in compound Gaussian HF sea clutter are presented and their performance evaluated. The combined use of AIS plots provided by cooperative targets can allow the operator to discriminate non-cooperative targets and possible threats. The concurrent exploitation of AIS and HFSWR data is presented and discussed by means of real data recorded during the NURC experiment in the northern Tyrrhenian Sea in May 2009.","marine radar,radar detection,automatic identification system data,radar clutter,target detection,Gaussian HF sea clutter,Marine vehicles,signal classification,HFSWR data,Tyrrhenian sea,Gaussian processes,search radar,vessel detection,cooperative target,high frequency surface wave radar,identification,radar tracking,vessel classification,knowledge-based integrated maritime surveillance system,noncooperative target,exclusive economic zone,"

"an unsupervised reconstruction-based fault detection algorithm for maritime components","2019","In recent years, the reliability and safety requirements of ship systems have increased drastically. This has prompted a paradigm shift toward the development of prognostics and health management (PHM) approaches for these systems' critical maritime components. In light of harsh environmental conditions with varying operational loads, and a lack of fault labels in the maritime industry generally, any PHM solution for maritime components should include independent and intelligent fault detection algorithms that can report faults automatically. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised reconstruction-based fault detection algorithm for maritime components. The advantages of the proposed algorithm are verified on five different data sets of real operational run-to-failure data provided by a highly regarded industrial company. Each data set is subject to a fault at an unknown time step. In addition, different magnitudes of random white Gaussian noise are applied to each data set in order to create several real-life situations. The results suggest that the algorithm is highly suitable to be included as part of a pure data-driven diagnostics approach in future end-to-end PHM system solutions.","maritime components,ship systems,Prediction algorithms,unsupervised learning,reliability,Maintenance engineering,deep learning,ships,Prognostics and health management,random white Gaussian noise,Gaussian noise,Fault detection,Machine learning algorithms,Degradation,condition monitoring,maritime industry,Automatic fault detection,Signal processing algorithms,remaining life assessment,intelligent fault detection algorithm,unsupervised reconstruction-based fault detection algorithm,prognostics and health management,fault diagnosis,"
"a novel model for ship trajectory anomaly detection based on gaussian mixture variational autoencoder","2023","The use of traditional methods in anomaly detection of multi-class ship trajectories showed some limitations in terms of robustness and learning ability of trajectory features. In view of this, an anomaly detection model for ship trajectory data based on Gaussian Mixture Variational Autoencoder (GMVAE) is proposed in this study using an unsupervised classification method. The proposed model modifies Variational Autoencoder (VAE) by changing the inferential distribution of prior distribution and approximate posterior to the Gaussian mixture model. A high-dimensional hidden space is constructed to learn the features of multi-class trajectory data, and the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) method is applied to measure the error between the reconstructed trajectory and the original trajectory in order to judge whether the ship trajectory is abnormal. The Automatic Identification System (AIS) data from the US coastal areas are used to verify the proposed model, and the results are compared with other commonly used models in a manually labeled dataset. The research results indicate that the detection rate of the proposed model is 91.26%, and the false alarm rate is 0.68%, which performs the best. Using the Gaussian mixture model to describe the distribution of hidden space can improve the learning ability of multi-class trajectories of VAE, thus increasing the robustness of the model. This research can provide technical support for ship trajectory data analysis and risk management of maritime transportation.","Trajectory,anomaly detection of ship trajectory,Clustering algorithms,Classification algorithms,Mathematical models,gaussian mixture variational autoencoder (gmvae),unsupervised learning,Gaussian distribution,Marine vehicles,Artificial neural networks,intelligent transportation,AIS,"

"ship behavior prediction via trajectory extraction-based clustering for maritime situation awareness","2022","This study presents a method in which historical AIS data are used to predict the future trajectory of a selected vessel. This is facilitated via a system intelligence-based approach that can be subsequently utilized to provide enhanced situation awareness to navigators and future autonomous ships, aiding proactive collision avoidance. By evaluating the historical ship behavior in a given geographical region, the method applies machine learning techniques to extrapolate commonalities in relevant trajectory segments. These commonalities represent historical behavior modes that correspond to the possible future behavior of the selected vessel. Subsequently, the selected vessel is classified to a behavior mode, and a trajectory with respect to this mode is predicted. This is achieved via an initial clustering technique and subsequent trajectory extraction. The extracted trajectories are then compressed using the Karhunen–Loéve transform, and clustered using a Gaussian Mixture Model. The approach in this study differs from others in that trajectories are not clustered for an entire region, but rather for relevant trajectory segments. As such, the extracted trajectories provide a much better basis for clustering relevant historical ship behavior modes. A selected vessel is then classified to one of these modes using its observed behavior. Trajectory predictions are facilitated using an enhanced subset of data that likely correspond to the future behavior of the selected vessel. The method yields promising results, with high classification accuracy and low prediction error. However, vessels with abnormal behavior degrade the results in some situations, and have also been discussed in this study.","Collision avoidance,Unsupervised learning,Trajectory prediction,AIS,Machine learning,Ship navigation,Maritime situation awareness,"

"deep learning aided beam vector assignment for massive mimo maritime communication considering location information and handover impact","2022","Location aided beamforming (LAB) has been proposed as a potential solution to fast beam vector (BV) selection for massive multi-input multi-output (M-MIMO) maritime communication systems. However, the existing LAB schemes hardly consider the impact from handover. In this paper, we propose to apply the Gaussian anomaly detection (GAD) to improve the system performance, particularly in the handover zone, by exploiting the information of sea lane and locations of the user equipment (UE). Furthermore, inspired by the rationale of deep learning (DL) aided image processing methods, we first transform the BV assignment problem to a location-based artificial gray value classification problem, and then utilize a convolutional deep belief networks (CDBN) to predict the BV indices from a predefined codebook constituted by location-related feature matrices. In addition, we exploit GAD to rectify the training data of CDBN, such that the prediction on BV assignments can be more accurate to achieve a higher capacity than known methods. Finally, an extensive comparison with selected existing schemes through simulations demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.","Convolutional deep belief network (CDBN),Maritime communication,Deep learning (DL),Massive multiple input multiple output (M-MIMO),Gaussian anomaly detection (GAD),"

"low-observable maritime tracking using monte carlo markov chain methods","1996","Kirubarajan and Bar-Shalom (see IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems, 1996) addressed an example tracking problem which is illustrated. At 30 second intervals, bearing measurements are made from a target which is assumed to be travelling in a straight line at constant (unknown) speed; these bearing measurements are subject to errors with a Gaussian distribution. The bearing measurements are illustrated. The task is to estimate the target track on the basis of the bearing measurements alone. Observability is already compromised in this scenario because of the absence of any range measurements, and the use of only a single bearing sensor. The problem is compounded by the fact that the target yields a very low signal/noise ratio, so that in each sonar scan, the bearing contact (if any) deriving from the target is mixed with numerous false alarms due to noise. We present our interim findings in tackling the same problem from a Bayesian statistical standpoint, using Monte Carlo Markov chain methods.","bearing measurements,false alarms,very low signal/noise ratio,single bearing sensor,measurement errors,Sonar tracking,sonar tracking,bearing contact,Bayesian statistics,Monte Carlo Markov chain methods,Gaussian distribution,target track estimation,sonar scan,low observable maritime tracking,"

To gain the trust of the operator, it is important to develop a robust system, which gives the operator enough insight to take a rational choice about future steps.

The dataset was collected under real operational conditions during a recent experimental activity. The frames in the dataset are characterized by heterogeneous backgrounds and different targets covering a wide range of sizes and speeds. To evaluate the performance, the ground truth has been manually labeled through direct observation in 4706 frames. All the examined techniques are used to estimate the background. They are preceded by a frame-based z-normalization. After the background estimation, the absolute difference with the normalized frame is computed to highlight both hot and cold targets. Once highlighted, the targets can be separated from the background with a threshold. Then, morphological operations both in time and space are executed to delete small and brief false alarms.

"fast detection of small targets in high-resolution maritime radars by feature normalization and fusion","2022","Joint exploitation of multiple features is a recognized way to implement the effective detection of small targets on the sea in high-resolution maritime radars at the dwelling mode. The tri-feature-based and feature-compression-based detectors use the time-consuming convex hull learning and decision. In this article, a fast feature-fusion-based detector using seven salient features is proposed, where the convex hull learning and decision are replaced by simple threshold determination and decision. It is found that the seven features of sea clutter can be modeled well by the Burr type XII and t-distributions. From the fitted distribution, each feature is normalized to approximate the standard Gaussian distribution by a nonlinear transformation. In the seven-dimensional normalized feature space, an analytical method is given to calculate the optimal weights of feature fusion by the maximization of the interclass distance of the two-class samples. Owing to the normalization of the seven features, the feature fusion loss is significantly reduced comparing with the direct fusion of seven features. The fast feature-fusion-based detector was evaluated on the open and recognized radar databases and offshore experimental data using an unmanned aerial vehicle with a corner reflector.

This study aims to develop a novel unsupervised methodology for feature extraction and knowledge discovery based on automatic identification system (AIS) data, allowing for seamless knowledge transfer to support trajectory data mining. The unsupervised hierarchical methodology is constructed from three parts: trajectory compression, trajectory similarity measure, and trajectory clustering. In the first part, an adaptive Douglas–Peucker with speed (ADPS) algorithm is created to preserve critical features, obtain useful information, and simplify trajectory information. Then, dynamic time warping (DTW) is utilized to measure the similarity between trajectories as the critical indicator in trajectory clustering. Finally, the improved spectral clustering with mapping (ISCM) is presented to extract vessel traffic behavior characteristics and mine movement patterns for enhancing marine safety and situational awareness. Comprehensive experiments are conducted and implemented in the Chengshan Jiao Promontory in China to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the novel methodology. Experimental results show that the proposed methodology can effectively compress the trajectories, determine the number of clusters in advance, guarantee the clustering accuracy, and extract useful navigation knowledge while significantly reducing the computational cost. The clustering results are further explored and follow the Gaussian mixture distribution, which can help provide new discriminant criteria for trajectory clustering.","Trajectory compression,Pattern extraction,Maritime traffic safety management,Knowledge discovery,Trajectory clustering,"
"wald- and rao-based detection for maritime radar targets in sea clutter with lognormal texture","2022","Non-Gaussian sea clutter causes conventional detectors designed in Gaussian clutter to suffer detection performance degradation, and some nuisance parameters cause the uniformly most powerful test to be unavailable. To improve the detection performance of maritime radar targets, we investigate the design of adaptive detectors in correlated non-Gaussian sea clutter by using suboptimal tests. The non-Gaussian sea clutter is modeled as a product of lognormal-distributed texture and complex Gaussian speckle. Two adaptive radar target detectors are developed by using the suboptimal two-step Wald and Rao tests. Specifically, a nonadaptive detector is derived by the Wald or Rao test when the clutter texture and speckle covariance matrix are assumed to be known in the first step; then the clutter parameters known in the first step are estimated, and the true parameters of the detector obtained in the first step are replaced with the estimated values. Theoretical proof and experimental verification indicate that the two proposed detectors have the constant false alarm property with regard to the clutter speckle covariance matrix and the clutter average power. Numerical results on simulated and measured radar data show that the proposed Rao-based detector outperforms its competitors and has stronger robustness to the signal mismatch compared to the proposed Wald-based detector.","Wald-based detector,covariance matrices,speckle,marine radar,detection performance degradation,complex Gaussian speckle,Wald test,radar detection,Lognormal texture,radar clutter,clutter texture,Gaussian clutter,adaptive radar,clutter speckle covariance matrix,sea clutter,adaptive detectors,radar targets,Covariance matrices,object detection,adaptive radar target detectors,Rao-based detector,maritime radar targets,Radar clutter,Radar,radar signal processing,clutter average power,Gaussian noise,Clutter,clutter parameters,nonGaussian sea clutter,Rao-based detection,Rao test,Gaussian distribution,Radar detection,Detectors,NonGaussian sea clutter,Speckle,"
"maritime vehicle tracking using underwater gliders and particle filters","2016","A major difficulty in tracking unidentified vessels at sea is due to the need to observe large areas for long periods of time for sparsely appearing targets. A possible solution is to use a network of energy efficient underwater gliders that use buoyancy engines and are equipped with sensor array, processing, and communication hardware. Gliders, however, have a limited size and payload which limits the length of their sensor array and the capabilities of their power, processing, and communication modules. This reduces the resolution of measurements that can be collected and processed on board of gliders and be communicated to a fusion center for accurate target tracking. In this work, we propose the use of adaptive compressive sensing and processing to enable accurate target tracking while using low signal acquisition, processing, and communication rates, short sensor array lengths, and simplified sensing and processing hardware hosted on gliders.

"background modeling in the fourier domain for maritime infrared target detection","2020","The estimation of the sea background from maritime infrared video sequences is necessary for target detection. It is challenging to obtain an accurate background model when the scene is a complex and fluctuating sea surface. However, the amplitude spectrum sequences at each frequency point of the pure seawater frames in the Fourier domain are more stable than the gray value sequences of each pixel in the spatial domain. Thus, the background is modeled with a Gaussian distribution in the Fourier domain with the mean and variance adapted over time. In addition, the sea background dynamics are introduced by the variance of the amplitude spectrum sequence, and the dynamic Gaussian discriminant coefficient is set up for each frequency point. Two target discrimination flags are presented based on the background dynamics and Gaussian discriminant process to extract the target more accurately. Furthermore, the entropy filter in the Fourier domain is designed to enhance the target and suppress the sea clutter.

"enhancing the reliability of shipborne ins/gnss integrated navigation system during abnormal sampling periods using bi-lstm and robust ckf","2023","Developing a reliable navigation system is a crucial challenge for intelligent ships. Integrating Inertial Navigation Systems (INS) with shipborne Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) provides a viable solution. However, the system's reliability heavily relies on GNSS availability. This paper proposes a method to enhance the reliability of shipborne INS/GNSS integrated navigation systems during GNSS abnormal sampling periods. The proposed method consists of two parts. Firstly, using specially designed input and output parameters, a pseudo-GNSS prediction model based on a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network (Bi-LSTM) is constructed to generate predicted pseudo-GNSS measurements during periods of GNSS loss, effectively filling in the gaps left by the absence of actual GNSS data. Secondly, Huber's M-estimation-based Robust Cubature Kalman filter (RCKF) is integrated into the data fusion algorithm, and a switching mechanism between RCKF and the Cubature Kalman filter (CKF) is established based on the source of GNSS data utilized for measurement update, to mitigate the impact of non-Gaussian distribution prediction noise introduced by pseudo-GNSS prediction model. Experimental validation using real ship navigation data in a natural marine environment confirms the proposed method's capability to maintain navigation accuracy during GNSS loss for shipborne INS/GNSS integrated navigation systems. The algorithm's superiority becomes more evident as the duration of GNSS loss increases, underscoring its effectiveness in enhancing shipborne integrated navigation system reliability.","Bi-LSTM,Intelligent ship,GNSS loss,Robust CKF,Navigation reliability,Ship integrated navigation,"
"a fully-autonomous framework of unmanned surface vehicles in maritime environments using gaussian process motion planning","2023","Unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) are of increasing importance to a growing number of sectors in the maritime industry, including offshore exploration, marine transportation, and defense operations.

Unlike path planning in terrestrial environments, planning in the maritime environment is more demanding as there is need to assure mitigating action is taken against the significant, random, and often unpredictable environmental influences from winds and ocean currents.

"antenna beampattern matched optimum coherent detection in high-resolution mechanically scanning maritime surveillance radars","2023","Mechanically scanning radars are still widely used in ocean guard and surveillance areas nowadays, owing to simple structure, light weight and low cost. The antenna rotation causes amplitude modulation of target returns along pulses by the antenna azimuth beampattern. The traditional coherent detection that ignores this modulation suffers from some performance loss. In this article, an antenna beampattern matched optimum coherent detector and a dual-threshold detection scheme are proposed for high-resolution mechanically scanning maritime surveillance radars. First, it is shown that the modulation of target returns is determined by the antenna azimuth beampattern, scan rate, and pulse repetition interval and the antenna scanning also affect the temporal correlation of sea clutter. Second, the antenna beampattern matched optimum coherent detector is given in compound-Gaussian sea clutter with inverse Gamma distributed texture and the pulse scanning mode is used to deal with unknown target azimuth angle in the matched filter. Third, to mitigate the high computational cost of the pulse scanning mode, a dual-threshold scheme is given, which searches all pulse-range cells by short-time integration and further confirms suspected cells whose test statistics are between the two lower and higher thresholds in the search by long-time integration. Moreover, two fast recursive clutter covariance matrix inversion algorithms along pulses and range cells are presented, which bring a great reduction in computational complexity.

"ship trajectory uncertainty prediction based on a gaussian process model","2019","The uncertainty of ship trajectory prediction is addressed. In particular, a probabilistic trajectory prediction model is proposed that describes the uncertainty in future positions along the ship trajectories by continuous probability distributions. The ship motion prediction is decomposed into lateral and longitudinal directions, and position probabilities are calculated along these two directions. A data-driven non-parametric Bayesian model based on a Gaussian Process is proposed to describe the lateral motion uncertainty, while the longitudinal uncertainty results from the uncertainty on the ship acceleration along the route. The parameters of the probabilistic models are derived off-line based on historic trajectory information provided by Automatic Identification System (AIS) data. The model is then applied to predict the trajectory uncertainty in real time by iteratively updating the prior probability models based on new observed AIS data. Moreover, a sequential Cholesky decomposition algorithm is applied in this study to reduce the computational effort required by the Gaussian Process modelling. Three months of AIS data are used to train and test the proposed probabilistic trajectory prediction model.

Experimental results illustrated that: 1) the proposed GPU-based parallel implementation frameworks could significantly reduce the computational time for both trajectory compression and visualization; 2) the influence of compressed vessel trajectories on trajectory visualization could be negligible if the compression threshold was selected suitably; and 3) the Gaussian kernel was capable of generating more appropriate KDE-based visualization performance by comparing with other seven kernel functions.","trajectory compression,Douglas-Peucker algorithm,vessel trajectory data quality,trajectory visualization,Internet of Things,Industries,GPU-accelerated compression,large-scale vessel trajectories,data visualisation,Acceleration,compression threshold,vessel trajectory,parallel computing,ships,KDE-based visualization,marine safety,kernel density estimation,marine engineering,GPU-based parallel implementation frameworks,maritime transportation,graphics processing units,automatic identification system,collision avoidance services,maritime IoT industries,intelligent traffic management,compressed vessel trajectories,KDE algorithm,Artificial intelligence,AIS-based vessel trajectory data,data compression,Data visualization,graphics processing unit (GPU),graphics processing unit,Graphics processing units,Trajectory,maritime Internet-of-Things industries,large-scale AIS data,marine vehicles,automatic vessel-tracking system,"
"target detection using gaussian mixture models and fourier transforms for uav maritime search and rescue","2017","In the event of a maritime disaster, casualties need to be found and rescued promptly.

"multichannel target detection for maritime radar","2019","Coherent target detection in a multichannel maritime radar is a challenging problem due to the dynamic nature of sea clutter. Traditional detectors, such as the adaptive matched filter, which are designed for homogeneous data exhibit significant performance degradation due to the non-Gaussianity and inhomogeneity of the sea clutter returns. To tackle this problem, we make use of the multichannel coherent single data set algorithm which removes the need for any training data, thus alleviating the problem of clutter heterogeneity. The algorithm performance is compared with traditional adaptive matched filter approaches using a Monte Carlo simulation with synthetic targets injected into a real multichannel data set.","Monte Carlo methods,detection,marine radar,homogeneous data,radar detection,multichannel maritime radar,radar clutter,Monte Carlo simulation,adaptive matched filter,sea clutter,Covariance matrices,coherent,matched filters,Training data,coherent target detection,object detection,Sea clutter,Doppler effect,multichannel data,synthetic targets,Radar,single snapshot,multichannel coherent single data set algorithm,multichannel target detection,Clutter,clutter heterogeneity,Object detection,Detectors,"
"self-adaption vessel traffic behaviour recognition algorithm based on multi-attribute trajectory characteristics","2020","Clustering analysis is commonly used for vessel traffic behaviour recognition. The clustering results reflect the characteristics of different vessel traffic behaviours, which can assist authorities in transportation management. However, there are two drawbacks to traditional clustering analysis. First, the similarity measures among different trajectories in a clustering analysis mainly focus on spatial differentiation and frequently do not consider motion features, such as speed and course. Second, the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm, a famous clustering analysis method, is characterized by poor self-adaption, which means that it cannot autonomously determine the best parameters based on different sample sets. These issues limit the efficiency of clustering analysis. To address these problems, a new similarity measure using statistical methods and based on multi-attribute trajectory characteristics is proposed to reflect the similarity among different trajectories. The proposed measure considers the spatial and motion features of trajectories. Furthermore, the Parzen window (a non-parametric estimation method) and the multivariate Gaussian distribution are employed to generate self-adaptive strategies to determine the optimal parameters of the DBSCAN algorithm for a given sample set. Finally, numerical experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed similarity measure and improved DBSCAN algorithm. The clustering analysis results obtained with the proposed method could provide insights towards better monitoring and navigation advice to help improve marine managerial effectiveness and avoid maritime accidents.","Vessel behaviour recognition,Self-adaption,Multi-attribute trajectory characteristics,DBSCAN,"

"synthetic trajectory extraction for maritime anomaly detection","2018","In the maritime domain, the main goal for large vessels is to drive as fast and efficiently as possible from one harbour to the next. This results in vessels following quite distinct routes. Deviations from these routes can be seen as indicators for illegal or at least suspicious behaviour. In order to extract these routes, clustering algorithms can be used, that will store the traffic patterns as synthetic trajectories. A vessel can be assigned to a specific route or a deviation from the routes can be detected by evaluating these route models. A challenge in designing the synthetic trajectories lies in the faithful representation, sparsity of data, treatment of outliers and split-up of routes. Here, a novel approach to model the uncertainty of the vessels movements while following a route is introduced: A cluster is now represented by a trajectory consisting of segments. Due to obstacles like shallow waters, a route might split up which will generate sub-segments. Instead of storing all cluster points, the position, speed, and course of the vessels are attached to each segment in form of normal distributions. Using these attributes, the probability of a deviation from the given trajectory can be estimated.","Clustering algorithms,Kernel,vessels movements,Anomaly detection,anomaly detection,traffic patterns,security of data,trajectory representation,ships,clustering algorithms,marine engineering,maritime domain,Heating systems,route models,pattern clustering,Artificial intelligence,maritime anomaly detection,synthetic trajectory extraction,Trajectory,data sparsity,probability,Gaussian distribution,data handling,"
"ais data-driven ship trajectory prediction modelling and analysis based on machine learning and deep learning methods","2023","Maritime transport faces new safety challenges in an increasingly complex traffic environment caused by large-scale and high-speed ships, particularly with the introduction of intelligent and autonomous ships. It is evident that Automatic Identification System (AIS) data-driven ship trajectory prediction can effectively aid in identifying abnormal ship behaviours and reducing maritime risks such as collision, stranding, and contact. Furthermore, trajectory prediction is widely recognised as one of the critical technologies for realising safe autonomous navigation. The prediction methods and their performance are the key factors for future safe and automatic shipping. Currently, ship trajectory prediction lacks the real performance measurement and analysis of different algorithms, including classical machine learning and emerging deep learning methods. This paper aims to systematically analyse the performance of ship trajectory prediction methods and pioneer experimental tests to reveal their advantages and disadvantages as well as fitness in different scenarios involving complicated systems. To do so, five machine learning methods (i.e., Kalman Filter (KF), Support Vector Progression (SVR), Back Propagation network (BP), Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), and Random Forest (RF)) and seven deep learning methods (i.e., Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gate Recurrent Unit (GRU), Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM), Sequence to Sequence (Seq2seq), Bi-directional Gate Recurrent Unit (Bi-GRU), and Transformer) are first extracted from the state-of-the-art literature review and then employed to implement the trajectory prediction and compare their prediction performance in the real world. Three AIS datasets are collected from the waters of representative traffic features, including a normal channel (i.e., the Chengshan Jiao Promontory), complex traffic (i.e., the Zhoushan Archipelago), and a port area (i.e., Caofeidian port). They are selected to test and analyse the performance of all twelve methods based on six evaluation indexes and explore the characteristics and effectiveness of the twelve trajectory prediction methods in detail. The experimental results provide a novel perspective, comparison, and benchmark for ship trajectory prediction research, which not only demonstrates the fitness of each method in different maritime traffic scenarios, but also makes significant contributions to maritime safety and autonomous shipping development.","Deep learning,Maritime safety,Trajectory prediction,AIS data,Machine learning,"
"track-before-detect using an airborne multichannel radar in the maritime domain","2023","This article explores methods for the detection and tracking of maritime targets using an airborne scanning multichannel radar, operating at high altitudes. The main technical difficulties include 1) the nonstationary and non-Gaussian nature of sea clutter when using a high-resolution airborne radar and 2) low-target signal-to-interference ratios due to higher grazing angles. It is proposed to carry out processing in two stages. First, space-time adaptive processing (STAP) is applied to exploit the spatial and temporal degrees of freedom available in the multichannel radar. Subsequently, target detection and tracking is performed using the track-before-detect method, applied to the STAP output. For the sake of comparison, a more traditional tracking method is also developed, where a detection threshold is applied to the STAP output, to obtain point measurements, subsequently processed via an extended target tracking methodology.

"image enhancement of maritime infrared targets based on joint features of grayscale and texture","2022","Maritime distress accidents usually occur in severe wind and wave environments. Infrared image enhancement technology can provide high-quality images for follow-up search and rescue work and has significant research value. This paper first analyzes the features of maritime infrared target images. According to the grayscale Gaussian distribution shape and gradient texture directionality of the target area, designs a target feature description operator and extracts the target feature image as the guide image for guided filtering. Then, the difference operation is performed between the original image and the filtering result, and the target detail layer that suppresses background noise and is not distorted is obtained. Finally, the target layer and the original image are fused with appropriate weights to obtain an enhanced image that retains the characteristics of the natural environment.

"bayesian filtering for dynamic anomaly detection and tracking","2022","This article presents a Bayesian approach for sequential detection of anomalies in the motion of a target and joint tracking. The anomaly is modeled as a binary (on/off) switching unknown control input that goes into action (begins to exist, or â€œswitches onâ€) thereby modifying the object dynamics; and by ceasing its activity (becoming nonexistent, or â€œswitching offâ€) returns the dynamics to nominal. The developed Bayesian framework brings together random finite set (RFS) theory to represent the switching nature of the anomaly, and optimal joint input and state estimation to sequentially update a hybrid state that incorporates a random vector for the kinematic state and a Bernoulli RFS for the unknown control input. In addition, a closed-form solution, the Gaussian-mixture hybrid Bernoulli filter (GM-HBF), has been developed to provide a customized solution for dynamic anomaly detection in the maritime domain characterized by linear Gaussian target dynamics. Based on the Ornsteinâ€“Uhlenbeck dynamic model for vessels, where the evolution of the object velocity is governed by a piecewise mean-reverting stochastic process, the anomaly can be represented by a change in the long-run mean velocity (i.e., the unknown control input) from the nominal condition that forces the vessel to deviate from its standard route. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed GM-HBF in both simulated and real-world maritime surveillance applications and test its performance in the face of false measurements, detection uncertainty, and sensor data gaps.","developed Bayesian framework,surveillance,kinematic state,Mathematical models,Anomaly detection,Automatic identification system (AIS),Bayesian approach,random finite sets (RFSs),Bayesian filtering,Bayes methods,object dynamics,linear Gaussian target dynamics,Switches,Bernoulli filter,switching unknown control input,Radio frequency,target tracking,Aerodynamics,stochastic processes,filtering theory,radar,state estimation,detection uncertainty,Gaussian processes,Bernoulli RFS,Radar tracking,maritime anomaly detection,dynamic anomaly detection,joint input and state estimation (JISE),probability,Ornstein-Uhlenbeck dynamic model,GM-HBF,Gaussian-mixture hybrid Bernoulli filter,"
"scanning radar simulation in the maritime environment","2020","Modelling and simulation of radar sea clutter is extremely important to assist with radar system design, evaluate radar detection algorithms and stimulate radar processors during development and testing. In this paper, the key tradeoffs in designing a scanning maritime radar are presented with details of how the radar return can be simulated. The sea clutter model is a compound Gaussian model with the spectrum modelled using the evolving Doppler spectrum model with an appropriate representation of the texture. This is important as the Doppler spectrum plays a key role in determining the statistics that are important for coherent processing. All parameters used in the simulation are determined by empirical models which in turn rely on user defined inputs including sea state, the wind and swell direction and the grazing angle.","scanning maritime radar,marine radar,radar detection,radar clutter,Time-domain analysis,radar system design,key tradeoffs,scanning radar simulation,modelling,ocean waves,object detection,radar return,simulation,Sea clutter,Doppler effect,Radar clutter,radar signal processing,sea clutter model,maritime environment,Azimuth,Doppler radar,Computational modeling,radar processors,sea state,compound Gaussian model,radar sea clutter,Radar detection,evolving Doppler spectrum model,empirical models,"
"maritime target tracking from an airborne multi-channel radar","2022","Detection and tracking of small maritime targets using high-resolution airborne radar is a difficult problem due to the non-stationary and non-Gaussian nature of sea clutter. This paper develops a target tracking algorithm for a scanning multi-channel radar operating in the maritime environment. The detection scheme uses space time adaptive processing (STAP) with a relatively high false alarm rate. While this improves the overall probability of detection, there are also a multitude of false (spurious) detections. As the radar scans, the target is illuminated over a range of azimuth angles, resulting in a large number of detections per target. A solution based on clustering the STAP output is proposed to create equivalent point target measurements, with the clustering output subsequently processed by a standard point-detection Bernoulli tracking filter. Through numerical simulations of high-fidelity airborne radar data, we demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves reliable tracking of targets characterised with low signal-to-interference ratios.","airborne radar,Clustering algorithms,radar scans,radar detection,radar clutter,equivalent point target measurements,STAP,high-resolution airborne radar,Sea measurements,sea clutter,false detections,STAP output,clustering output,space time adaptive processing,nonGaussian nature,target tracking,numerical simulations,maritime surveillance,Target tracking,small maritime target detection,object detection,extended target tracking,small maritime target tracking,detection scheme,signal-to-interference ratios,nonstationary nature,Radar,radar signal processing,high false alarm rate,airborne multichannel radar,target tracking algorithm,space-time adaptive processing,standard point-detection Bernoulli tracking filter,Airborne radar,maritime environment,probability,Surveillance,high-fidelity airborne radar data,Spaceborne radar,maritime target tracking,tracking filters,scanning multichannel radar,Radar detection,"
