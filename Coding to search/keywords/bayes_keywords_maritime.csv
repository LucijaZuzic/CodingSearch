"joint tracking and classification for extended targets in maritime surveillance","2018","In the framework of target tracking, joint tracking and classification (JTC) based approaches have been recently introduced to adjust the trajectory estimation to a given type of target. In a maritime surveillance framework, these approaches leverage marine radar capabilities to provide high resolution measurements. It can then be helpful to choose relevant motion models regarding the tracking algorithm. Among them, the authors recently proposed to take advantage of the target extent measurements for single or multiple-target tracking. This work was based on a point source hypothesis regarding the position measurement of each target. However, this is no longer suitable for extended target tracking. An extension of our previous work to track properly extended targets whose position measurement can be obtained from any point source of its surface is thus proposed. For this purpose, random matrix theory is leveraged. Eventually, the relevance of the proposed approach with simulated data is analyzed.","high resolution measurements,position measurement,Position measurement,marine radar,Bayesian estimation,image resolution,image motion analysis,matrix algebra,trajectory estimation,maritime surveillance framework,Radar measurements,random matrix theory,multiple-target tracking,target tracking,tracking algorithm,joint tracking and classification,Target tracking,extended target tracking,image classification,search radar,Radar tracking,radar imaging,random matrix,radar tracking,target extent measurements,Surveillance,motion models,Joint tracking and classification,target classification,marine radar capabilities,target extent,"
"statistical performance of classifiers for a maritime atr task","2008","This research explores the statistical performance of several classifiers (Bayes, nearest neighbor, and a neural network) on a maritime ATR problem. The features employed were derived from range profiles and inspired by the physical structure of the ship targets to maximize the generalizability of the classifiers.

"modeling a probabilistic ontology for maritime domain awareness","2011","Situational awareness and prediction are essential elements of information fusion. Both involve various types of uncertainty and require a sound automated inferential process. Probabilistic ontologies support uncertainty management in se-mantically aware systems, and facilitate modular, interoperable systems. This paper describes the process of developing a probabilistic ontology for a Maritime Domain Awareness application. The ontology was created to support identification of ships behaving suspiciously enough to be declared ships of interest. The original model was expanded in two ways: to provide reasons for declaring a ship as being of interest, and to include individual crew member associations. The latter is achieved by supporting inferences about a person's close relations, group associations, communications, and background influences to assess his likelihood of having terrorist links.","predictive situational awareness,sensor fusion,sound automated inferential process,Marine vehicles,maritime domain awareness,Bayesian networks,terrorist links,Organizations,MEBN,information fusion,uncertainty management,semantically aware systems,Electronic countermeasures,group associations,modeling methodology,uncertainty reasoning,ships,person close relations,Probabilistic logic,ontologies (artificial intelligence),situational awareness,PR-OWL,interoperable systems,uncertainty handling,essential element prediction,probabilistic ontology,Ontologies,facilitate modular,web services,Uncertainty,Terrorism,"

"an integrated maritime reasoning and monitoring system","2012","Maritime information systems typically offer system features for data collection, information fusion and the automated construction of a basic recognized maritime picture for human operators. However making sense of maritime situations is still very much an intensive human-based cognitive endeavor. Limited human resources face difficult cognitive challenges in making sense of huge amount of data generated daily by dynamic round-the-clock maritime shipping and port activities. An effective information exploitation system for maritime surveillance and monitoring is expected to be able to augment human-based surveillance and monitoring operations with machine-based computing capabilities to interpret and reason about massive amount of situational information, as well as transforming this knowledge into actionable decision indicators for the human decision makers. The Defence Science & Technology Agency (DSTA) has developed the PACKED model to guide the exploration and development of computing technologies that support human decision making and other cognitive challenges in information rich, complex, and dynamic operational environments. An integrated maritime reasoning and monitoring system illustrates how computing technologies are applied in the areas of Attention, Knowledge, and Comprehension to support situation analysis and monitoring processes for maritime surveillance. The maritime reasoning and monitoring system consist of Bayesian reasoning, entity network analysis, and movement pattern analysis, to integrate, analyze, interpret and reason about maritime data. The Graylist Network Analysis (GNA) engine probes networks of entity-relationships to uncover â€œgraylistedâ€ entities that are closely associated with blacklisted entities. The Movement Pattern Analysis (MPA) engine uncovers common patterns in vessel movements and monitors real-time for maritime traffic data for anomalous vessel movements.

"quantitative analysis on risk influencing factors for major maritime accidents from a worldwide perspective","2023","Maritime transport plays an increasingly important role in global shipping. In the meantime, with the development of the shipping industry, the frequency of maritime traffic accidents is also increasing. More importantly, the increasing number of maritime traffic accidents with serious consequences in the past 20 years cannot be ignored. Analysis of major accidents can help identify trends and prevent future accidents. The data set of maritime traffic accidents from 2002 to 2022 is analyzed in this study, focusing on the ship size, ship age, ship type, and other factors of ships involved in major accidents. Regarding to the accidents that with serious consequences in the past 20 years, Bayesian rules and least square method are synthesized to model the historical accident data. This method compares the accident risks of different sizes and types of ships in pairs, calculates and analyzes the impact of each risk factor on the occurrence of serious accidents. The results indicate that the risk of major accidents on small and medium-sized ships is higher than that on large ships. It also indicates that improving the safety of auxiliary ships and bulk carriers is significant in preventing major accidents.

"on the effectiveness of ai-assisted anomaly detection methods in maritime navigation","2020","The automatic identification system (AIS) has become an essential tool for maritime security. Nevertheless, how to effectively use the static and dynamic voyage information of the AIS data in maritime traffic situation awareness is still a challenge. This paper presents a comparative study of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques on their effectiveness in dealing with various anomalies in maritime domain using the AIS data. The AIS on-off switching (OOS) anomaly is critical in maritime security, since AIS technology is susceptible to manipulation and it can be switched on and off to hide illegal activities. Thus, we try to detect and distinguish between intentional and non-intentional AIS OOS anomalies through our AI -assisted anomaly detection framework. We use AIS data, in particular positional and navigational status of vessels, to study the effectiveness of seven AI techniques, such as artificial neural network, support vector machine, logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, decision tree, random forest and naive Bayes, in detecting the AIS OOS anomalies. Our experimental results show that ANN and SVM are the most suitable techniques in detecting the AIS OOS anomalies with 99.9% accuracy. Interestingly, the ANN model outperforms others when trained with a balanced (i.e., same order of samples per class) dataset, and SVM, on the other hand, is suitable when training dataset is unbalanced.","maritime traffic situation awareness,AI-assisted anomaly detection,decision trees,Support vector machines,logistic regression,Anomaly detection,static voyage information,random forests,ANN,marine navigation,Feature extraction,security of data,maritime security,k-nearest neighbors,regression analysis,AIS technology,naive Bayes,neural nets,naive Bayes methods,automatic identification system,marine safety,marine engineering,support vector machines,maritime navigation,dynamic voyage information,maritime domain,random forest,SVM,Artificial intelligence,AIS on-off switching anomaly,nearest neighbour methods,artificial neural network,Training,Trajectory,support vector machine,nonintentional AIS OOS anomalies,Navigation,artificial intelligence,decision tree,AIS data,"
"maritime anomaly detection using gaussian process active learning","2012","A model of normal vessel behaviours is useful for detecting illegal, suspicious, or unsafe behaviour; such as vessel theft, drugs smuggling, people trafficking or poor sailing. This work presents a data-driven non-parametric Bayesian model, based on Gaussian Processes, to model normal shipping behaviour. This model is learned from Automatic Identification System (AIS) data and uses an Active Learning paradigm to select an informative subsample of the data to reduce the computational complexity of training. The resultant model allows a measure of normality to be calculated for each newly-observed transmission according to its velocity given its current latitude and longitude. Using this measure of normality, ships can be identified as potentially anomalous and prioritised for further investigation. The model performance is assessed by its ability to detect artificially generated AIS anomalies at locations around the United Kingdom. Finally, the model is demonstrated on case studies from artificial and real vessel data to detect anomalies in unusual tracks.","identification technology,data mining,automatic identification system data,data-driven nonparametric Bayesian model,Bayes methods,Marine vehicles,normal vessel behaviours,unsafe behaviour detection,informative data subsampling,Accuracy,illegal behaviour detection,Bayesian methods,sampling methods,real vessel data,Gaussian process active learning,United Kingdom,Data models,Gaussian processes,artificially generated AIS anomalies detection,maritime anomaly detection,artificial vessel data,training computational complexity,training,Training,behavioural sciences,computational complexity,normal shipping behaviour model,Computational modeling,suspicious behaviour detection,learning (artificial intelligence),newly-observed transmission,AIS data,"
"dissecting uncertainty-based fusion techniques for maritime anomaly detection","2015","Detecting and classifying anomalies for Maritime Situation Awareness gets a lot of benefit from the combination of multiple sources, correlating their output for detecting inconsistencies in vessels' behaviour. Adequate uncertainty representation and processing is crucial for this higher-level task where the operator analyses information correlating with his background knowledge. This paper addresses the problem of performance criteria selection and definition for information fusion systems in their ability to handle uncertainty. Indeed, i addition to the classical algorithmic performances of accuracy or timeliness, other aspects such as the interpretation, simplicity, expressiveness need to be considered in the design of the technique for uncertainty management for a improved synergy between the human and the system. In this paper, we dissect several uncertainty representation and reasoning techniques (URRTs) addressing a fusion problem for maritime anomaly detection. The uncertainty supports are identified as a basis for the global expressiveness criterion. A selection of six elementary URRTs are described and compared according to their expressiveness power of uncertainty, using the Uncertainty Representation and Reasoning Framework (URREF) ontology.

"joint stochastic prediction of vessel kinematics and destination based on a maritime traffic graph","2022","Maritime traffic increases every year, and therefore also the amount of traffic data from the Automatic Identification System (AIS). Utilizing these data on traffic patterns and possible destinations for long-term vessel prediction is here an important way of gaining maritime situational awareness (MSA) for use in the decision making in autonomous ships, such as collision avoidance algorithms, which can reduce collision risk during voyage. In this article, we present a destination inference method based on piece-wise Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) processes for predicting vessel motions along common traffic lanes toward a set of destinations. The mean velocities of the processes are inferred through the creation of a maritime graph that represents the major traffic patterns in the area of consideration. After using an OU process for prediction along major sea lanes, the Equilibrium Reverting Velocity (ERV) bridging model is used to enable convergence of the prediction towards considered destinations. Then, based on the OU process and ERV bridging model for prediction, Bayesian inference is used to estimate the posterior destination distribution. Tested on a real-time AIS dataset, the method is shown to perform better than current state-of-the art methods in destination inference as it indirectly takes land and passed destinations into account.","Traffic control,mean velocities,Prediction algorithms,vessel kinematics,Bayes methods,equilibrium reverting velocity bridging model,Destination inference,traffic patterns,posterior destination distribution,Stochastic processes,Predictive models,traffic lanes,sea lanes,maritime situational awareness,long-term vessel prediction,piece-wise Ornstein-Uhlenbeck,Mechatronics,ships,marine safety,automatic identification system,marine engineering,stochastic processes,joint stochastic prediction,collision risk,maritime graph,real-time AIS dataset,maritime graphs,traffic data,Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes,vessel motions,maritime traffic graph,decision making,collision avoidance algorithms,Bayesian inference,Real-time systems,graph theory,ERV bridging model,telecommunication traffic,inference mechanisms,traffic engineering computing,Navigation,collision avoidance,OU process,AIS data,destination inference method,autonomous ships,"
"maritime atr using classifier combination and high resolution range profiles","2011","A maritime automatic target recognition system is developed that performs ship classification using one-dimensional high resolution range profiles. Five physically based features are defined and are extracted from both VV and HH polarizations resulting in a 10-dimensional feature vector. A nonlinear classifier combination approach involving a neural network combiner along with three individual classifiers (Bayes, nearest neighbor, and neural network) is proposed. A decision confidence measure based on the classifier discriminants is developed using a nonparametric estimation approach. The confidence measure enables the system to reject samples that have a low decision confidence. The performance of the proposed neural network based combination is compared with individual classifiers and a number of other combination rules.

"ontologies for probabilistic situation assessment in the maritime domain","2013","In the maritime domain, surveillance systems are used to track vessels in a certain area of interest. The resulting vessel tracks are then displayed in a dynamic map. However, the interpretation of the dynamic environment, i.e., the situation assessment (SA) process, is still done by human experts. Several methods exist that can be used for automatic SA, but often they are based on machine learning algorithms and do not include the knowledge of the decision maker. In this article, we describe how expert knowledge can be used to determine models for automatic SA. The knowledge about situations of interest is modeled as an ontology, which can be transformed into a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN). The main challenge of this transformation is the determination of the structure and the parameter settings of the DBN.

Bayesian methodology provides established instruments for fusion of uncertain identification and assessment indications from various information sources.

This generic model defines adequate and necessary node types, well suited for modeling of identification and assessment tasks. In addition, the model provides a dependency structure by subgraphs, which simplifies provision of more complex cause-effect relations in Bayesian Identification Networks.

"the usefulness of artificial intelligence for safety assessment of different transport modes","2023","Recent research in transport safety focuses on the processing of large amounts of available data by means of intelligent systems, in order to decrease the number of accidents for transportation users. Several Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications have been developed to address safety problems and improve efficiency of transportation systems. However exchange of knowledge between transport modes has been limited. This paper reviews the ML and AI methods used in different transport modes (road, rail, maritime and aviation) to address safety problems, in order to identify good practices and experiences that can be transferable between transport modes. The methods examined include statistical and econometric methods, algorithmic approaches, classification and clustering methods, artificial neural networks (ANN) as well as optimization and dimension reduction techniques. Our research reveals the increasing interest of transportation researchers and practitioners in AI applications for crash prediction, incident/failure detection, pattern identification, driver/operator or route assistance, as well as optimization problems. The most popular and efficient methods used in all transport modes are ANN, SVM, Hidden Markov Models and Bayesian models. The type of the analytical technique is mainly driven by the purpose of the safety analysis performed.

"imitating radar operator decisions for maritime surveillance missions using bayesian networks","2019","This paper presents the use of Bayesian networks for learning decisions made by a human radar operator carrying out a maritime surveillance mission. By imitating the operator's decisions, a significant increase in the autonomy of a radar surveillance system can be achieved as well as potentially streamlining the qualification process. For maritime scenarios, current literature has only focused on using a Bayesian network (BN) for identification and assessment, and often assumes inputs from a generic surveillance sensor. Furthermore, in both the maritime surveillance and radar operations domain, there has been no investigation into using the operator's data in order to learn the decisions made throughout the mission. This paper uses a realtime radar simulation in order to obtain the scenario and radar information that would be observed by a human operator. In conjunction with a user interface, the simulation is further used to obtain operator decisions for a given mission with the maximum likelihood approach used to obtain the BN probabilities. The BN is then used in place of the operator for interfacing with the simulation in order to test the suitability of this method. Several typical scenarios are used to demonstrate the BN's operational ability relative to that of the operator.

"low-observable maritime tracking using monte carlo markov chain methods","1996","Kirubarajan and Bar-Shalom (see IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems, 1996) addressed an example tracking problem which is illustrated. At 30 second intervals, bearing measurements are made from a target which is assumed to be travelling in a straight line at constant (unknown) speed; these bearing measurements are subject to errors with a Gaussian distribution. The bearing measurements are illustrated. The task is to estimate the target track on the basis of the bearing measurements alone. Observability is already compromised in this scenario because of the absence of any range measurements, and the use of only a single bearing sensor. The problem is compounded by the fact that the target yields a very low signal/noise ratio, so that in each sonar scan, the bearing contact (if any) deriving from the target is mixed with numerous false alarms due to noise. We present our interim findings in tackling the same problem from a Bayesian statistical standpoint, using Monte Carlo Markov chain methods.","bearing measurements,false alarms,very low signal/noise ratio,single bearing sensor,measurement errors,Sonar tracking,sonar tracking,bearing contact,Bayesian statistics,Monte Carlo Markov chain methods,Gaussian distribution,target track estimation,sonar scan,low observable maritime tracking,"
"interval prediction of vessel trajectory based on lower and upper bound estimation and attention-modified lstm with bayesian optimization","2023","Uncertainty prediction of vessel trajectory is essential to enhance maritime situational awareness and traffic safety. Traditional approaches for trajectory prediction face challenges in accurately quantifying uncertainties, thereby limiting effectiveness in decision-making. To address this challenge, we propose a hybrid interval prediction frame of vessel trajectory using the lower and upper bound estimation (LUBE) and attention-modified long short-term memory (LSTM) network with bayesian optimization (BO). Firstly, trajectory data is preprocessed to solve the scale irregularity. Then, a novel trajectory interval prediction model for perceiving the prediction uncertainties is designed based on an advanced attention-modified LSTM with interval prediction capability. Meanwhile, a supervised training strategy with differentiating the interval widths of latitude and longitude is put forward to devise sample labels for training the model. Additionally, a new prediction interval-based objective function is proposed considering the target of maximizing coverage and minimizing width of trajectory interval. The BO algorithm optimizes the weighted parameters in the LSTM network by minimizing the objective function value. Finally, cases from two water areas are implemented to test and verify the proposed method. The results illustrate the superiority of the proposed approach in (1) outperforming other methods used for comparison in both coverage probability and width criteria of prediction interval. (2) quantifying the prediction uncertainty and improving the reliability of trajectory predictor. (3) performing anomaly detection tasks using visualized trajectory prediction intervals.

"track initiation for maritime radar tracking with and without prior information","2018","Reliable track initiation is an important component of a tracking system, especially when it is used as part of a more general collision avoidance (COLAV) system. Some tracking methods (e.g., IPDA) come with an in-built track initiation capability, while other methods (e.g., JPDA) lack this capability, which in such cases typically is taken care of by heuristic rules such as the M/N logic. Although Reid's multiple hypothesis tracker (MHT) is capable of track initiation, many implementations do not include track initiation in the MHT framework due to the increased complexity. While MHT is fundamentally Bayesian, the non-Bayesian sequential probability ratio test (SPRT) of Van Keuk is often used for track initiation. In this paper we derive a Bayesian SPRT for track initiation based on Reid's MHT. The approach is compared with the classical SPRT, both from a theoretical perspective and using simulations. Furthermore, the paper provides a comparison between the two SPRT versions, the IPDA and the M/N logic in terms of system operating characteristic (SOC) curves and track initiation time. The initiation methods are also tested on real radar data recorded during full-scale maritime COLAV experiments.","Target tracking,nonBayesian sequential probability ratio test,reliable track initiation,probability,Clutter,Radar tracking,Area measurement,target tracking,collision avoidance system,maritime radar tracking,MHT framework,Bayes methods,Logic gates,radar tracking,"

"airborne maritime surveillance using magnetic anomaly detection signature","2020","For an airborne sensor, there is a pressing need to be able to detect/track submerged submarines, shipwrecks, sea mines, unexploded explosive ordnance, and buried drums during maritime surveillance. Traditional usage is the magnetic anomaly detection (MAD), where the small changes in the earth's magnetic field caused by the ferrous components of the targets are measured. The primary means of long-range detection and classification of targets are with passive and active acoustic sensors, and MAD is used for accurate final localization. MAD could also be used for land-based targets but this is not common. Knowing the relationship between the magnetic signature and the kinematic parameters, the tracking problem can be formulated under a Bayesian framework. In this article, multiple nonlinear filters are used for a real single surface-target tracking problem in maritime surveillance using an airborne total-field sensor. The posterior CramÃ©r-Rao lower bound for MAD is derived.

"new frontiers in the risk assessment of ship collision","2023","Navigation is becoming more and more complex over the years. The increase in maritime traffic and vessel size is inducing a global escalation of ship collision accidents, with consequent losses of human lives and economic assets worth billions. This is particularly true for port basins, with maritime authorities struggling worldwide to keep up with the ever-increasing ship traffic. In this respect, the demand for advanced methods to assess and mitigate ship collision risk has never been higher. The interdependency between physical failures, weather conditions, logistics, governance and human factors requires sophisticated frameworks to effectively assist maritime authorities and navigators in decision-making. The present work reviews the most recent advancements in the risk assessment of ship collision. The article focuses on new, rising technologies, identifying the current main trends and discussing future perspectives and challenges. The review revealed a wide and diversified range of methods, including machine learning, clustering techniques, swarm intelligence algorithms and others. To frame the methods in the current literature and compare them with previous efforts, they are categorized according to literature classifications. Advancements of well-established approaches and new promising tools are discussed, considering methods that allow the inclusion of quantitative and qualitative variables in the assessment. Furthermore, a comprehensive analysis of a database of maritime accidents in port areas is carried out to investigate prevailing trends in both worldwide and Mediterranean Sea contexts. Results indicate that ship collision accidents constitute the majority compared with other types of accidents, especially in the Mediterranean.","Collision avoidance,Swarm intelligence,Neural network,Bayesian network,Maritime safety,Navigation risk,"
"automatic identification of maritime incidents from unstructured articles","2018","In this paper, we present two Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for identifying maritime incidents described in unstructured articles from multiple sources. The first technique is a document classification scheme that determines if an article describes a maritime incident. Two variations of each article are created: the first only contains the article's title, the other contains the title and content. These are converted to both binary and frequency bags-of-words. Furthermore, two feature selection methods are tested: Weka's CfsSubsetEval and retaining the 300 most frequent words. Each dataset is tested with 41 classifiers from the Weka suite, with the most accurate classifiers including Logistic Regression (98.5%), AdaBoostM1(BayesNet) (98.33%), and RandomForest (97.56%). The second technique performs information extraction on an article to determine the location of the maritime incident. In addition to using regular expressions and Named Entity Recognition (NER), the approach focuses its attention on sentences that contain piracy keywords as well as sentences which occur earlier in the article. In our testing, this approach achieved 87.9% accuracy. Together the two techniques form a pipeline where the positive examples from the document classification algorithm are fed into the information extraction algorithm.","Risk management,unstructured articles,information extraction algorithm,Natural Language Processing,Information retrieval,word processing,Conferences,Feature extraction,natural language processing,maritime risk assessment,regression analysis,automatic maritime incident identification,RandomForest,Weka suite classifiers,marine engineering,Logistic Regression,piracy keywords,feature extraction,pattern classification,risk management,random processes,Named Entity Recognition,feature selection,document classification,text analysis,Natural language processing,Task analysis,Weka CfsSubsetEval,Data mining,learning (artificial intelligence),binary bags-of-words,AdaBoostM1,frequency bags-of-words,"
"holocene temperature changes in northern fennoscandia reconstructed from chironomids using bayesian modelling","2002","The recently developed Bayesian multinomial calibration model, Bummer, was applied to the fossil chironomid assemblages of a lake situated at the present tree-line in northern Fennoscandia to reconstruct patterns in Holocene climates. The results are compared with inferences derived using non-Bayesian weighted averaging partial least-squares regression. The reconstruction exhibits both long-term trends as well as a series of shorter-term oscillations. Abrupt climatic excursions were particularly characteristic for the early Holocene period, with cooling episodes around 9200, 8600 and 8200calyr BP. The interval from ca 8000 to 5800calyr BP appeared to be warm and stable, but was followed by a pronounced climatic cooling around 5800calyr BP leading to a relatively long-lasting mid-Holocene temperature minimum between ca 5800 and 4000calyr BP. The reconstruction during the latter part of the Holocene is relatively featureless, which may partly be due to gradual shallowing of the lake by sedimentation that may have affected chironomid compositions, thereby masking the climate signal. The major climatic patterns in our reconstruction agree well with inferences from Greenland ice and marine sediments and are also in line with the previous reconstructions based on diatoms and pollen from the same core, although the finer-scale variations reflected by the three proxies do not always match. The overall results provide evidence for climatic complexity during the Holocene epoch and demonstrate that Bayesian modelling is highly suitable for reconstruction purposes.",""
"threat assessment of the maritime targets based on dynamic bayesian networks","2022","In order to efficiently and accurately grasp and predict the state of the maritime target of the enemy, it is necessary to conduct the threat assessment of the maritime targetâ€™s state. The current threat assessment methods for maritime targets mainly rely on the commanderâ€™s judgment based on human experience, and it is difficult to adapt to the complex and real-time changing requirements of information sources in the war. This paper fully considers battlefield combat factors, selects target features and performs fuzzy processing, using dynamic Bayesian network method to establish a threat assessment model for maritime targets. Then we combine the calculation examples to analyze two types of maritime targets based on dynamic and static Bayesian networks. The target threat assessment methods are compared and analyzed.

"improving maritime situational awareness by fusing sensor information and intelligence","2011","In present-day military security operations threats are more difficult to reveal than in conventional warfare theatres, since they take place during the course of normal life. These maritime missions often take place in littoral environments, where acts of piracy, drug trafficking and other threatening events become obscured in the crowd of everyday fisheries, cargo traders, ferries and pleasure cruises, hindering situation awareness. We aim to improve situation awareness and threat detection capabilities in maritime scenarios by combining sensor-based information with context information and intelligence from various sources. The fusion and analysis in order to reveal suspect from normal behavior is based on domain ontologies. A test bed allows the study of various exploitation and assessments techniques applied to these domain ontologies.

"optimizing cnn hyperparameters for mental fatigue assessment in demanding maritime operations","2020","Human-related issues play an important role in accidents and causalities in demanding maritime operations. The industry lacks an approach capable of preventively assessing maritime operators' mental fatigue and awareness levels before accidents happen. Aiming to reduce intrusiveness, we focused on improving the mental fatigue assessment capabilities of a combination of electroencephalogram and electrocardiogram sensors by investigating the optimization of convolutional neural networks by Bayesian optimization with Gaussian process. We proposed a mapping function to optimize the network structure without the need for a tree-like structure to define the domain of variables for the optimization process. We applied the proposed approach in a simulated vessel piloting task. Even though the mental fatigue assessment for the cross-subject case is a complex classification task, the trained convolutional neural network could achieve good generalization performance (97.6% test accuracy). Finally, we also proposed a method to improve the depiction of the mental fatigue build up process.

"anomaly detection and tracking based on meanâ€“reverting processes with unknown parameters","2019","Piecewise mean-reverting stochastic processes have been recently proposed and validated as an effective model for long-term object prediction. In this paper, we exploit the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) dynamic model to represent an anomaly as any deviation of the long-run mean velocity from the nominal condition. This amounts to modeling the anomaly as an unknown switching control input that can affect the dynamics of the object. Under this model, the problem of joint anomaly detection and tracking can be addressed within the Bayesian random set framework by means of a hybrid Bernoulli filter (HBF) that sequentially estimates a Bernoulli random set (empty under nominal behavior) for the unknown long-run mean velocity, and a random vector for the kinematic state of the object. An additional challenge is represented by the fact that two extra parameters, i.e. the reversion rate and the noise covariance of the underlying OU process, need to be specified for Bayes-optimal prediction. We propose a multiple-model adaptive filter (MMA-HBF) for anomaly detection, tracking and simultaneous estimation of the OU unknown parameters.

"data-driven fraud detection in international shipping","2018","Document fraud constitutes a growing problem in international shipping. Shipping documentation may be deliberately manipulated to avoid shipping restrictions or customs duties. Well-known examples of such fraud are miscoding and smuggling. These are cases in which the documentation of a shipment does not correctly or entirely describe the goods in transit. In an attempt to reduce the risks of document fraud, shipping companies and customs authorities typically perform random audits to check the accompanying documentation of shipments. Although these audits detect many fraud schemes, they are quite labor intensive and do not scale to the massive amounts of cargo that is shipped each day. This paper investigates whether intelligent fraud detection systems can improve the detection of miscoding and smuggling by analyzing large sets of historical shipment data. We develop a Bayesian network that predicts the presence of goods on the cargo list of shipments. The predictions of the Bayesian network are compared with the accompanying documentation of a shipment to determine whether document fraud is perpetrated. We also show how a set of discriminative models can be derived from the topology of the Bayesian network and perform the same fraud detection task. Our experimental results show that intelligent fraud detection systems can considerably improve the detection of miscoding and smuggling compared to random audits.","Neural networks,International shipping,Fraud detection,Logistic regression,Bayesian networks,Probablistic classification,"

"development of an interpretable maritime accident prediction system using machine learning techniques","2022","Every year, maritime accidents cause severe damages not only to humans but also to maritime instruments like vessels. The authors of this work therefore propose a machine learning-based maritime accident prediction system that can be used to prevent maritime accidents from happening by predicting and interpreting the accidents. This work overcomes the limitations of the existing works that lack practicability in the sense that the ex-post analyses are conducted to suggest accident prevention strategies but maritime accidents are not analyzed holistically. Using extensive literature reviews and expert interviews, a large number of risk factors associated with maritime accidents are identified, and related data are collected and utilized in the work. Throughout variable selection, data retrieval, hot-spot identification, and the maritime accident prediction model construction process, various machine learning algorithms are exploited in order to construct an organized system. In addition, interpretations for the resulting accident predictions are given using interpretable machine learning algorithms so as to provide explainable results to users. Finally, the proposed system is evaluated using a SERVQUAL model and proves its effectiveness in real-world applications.","Human factors,Predictive models,Risk management,Safety,accident prediction,Bayes methods,ocean engineering,Accidents,Machine learning,interpretable machine learning,Maritime accident,"
"an integrated dynamic ship risk model based on bayesian networks and evidential reasoning","2021","The paper proposes a probabilistic framework for assessing the risk of ships based on a hybrid approach and multiple data sources. A Bayes-based network learning approach uses data from the New Inspection Regime of the Paris MoU on Port State Control to characterise the relationships among risk parameters and uses these parameters to evaluate the ship static risk. Other data sources are used to develop a Bayesian Network model to assess the dynamic risk of the ship. The data is aggregated by Bayesian Network and Evidential Reasoning approaches to evaluate the overall risk of ships in coastal waters. The objective of the study is to develop a model to assess the risk of an individual ship by considering its static risk profile and the geographical-dependant risk factors related to the characteristics of the maritime traffic flow and other local characteristics that influence the navigational risk of the ship. The results show that the integrated approach is able to assess the overall risk of a ship based on multiple data sources, providing empirical evidence of using multiple data sources in risk analysis applications. Moreover, the developed model identifies the most critical circumstances and the key impact factors in the study waters, which can support decisions on risk prevention and mitigation measures and local maritime traffic management.","Evidential Reasoning,Rule-based approach,Static and dynamic ship risk,Bayesian Networks,Automatic identification system data,Port State Control inspection data,Maritime risk analysis,"

"research into vessel behaviour pattern recognition in the maritime domain: past, present and future","2021","A comprehensive literature review on vessel behaviour pattern recognition in maritime and littoral environments, spanning a period of three decades, is presented. A vast majority of research focuses on anomalous vessel behaviour detection from Automated Identification System (AIS) data, using artificial intelligence (AI), Bayesian networks and machine learning based methods. AIS is a cooperative system that employs VHF transceivers to share vessel information through terrestrial and satellite communication networks. To track small boats not fitted with AIS, uncooperative surveillance systems are employed. These systems have been studied in a relatively small number of publications. In vessel behaviour pattern recognition, target classification is critically important, particularly, in asymmetric warfare situations. The paper concludes with a discussion of future outlook in vessel behaviour pattern recognition research.","Vessel behaviour recognition,Target tracking,Pattern of life,Anomaly detection,Plan recognition,Bayesian networks,Target classification,"
"deeptracks: geopositioning maritime vehicles in video acquired from a moving platform","2021","Geopositioning and tracking a moving boat at sea is a very challenging problem, requiring boat detection, matching and estimating its GPS location from imagery with no common features. The problem can be stated as follows: given imagery from a camera mounted on a moving platform with known GPS location as the only valid sensor, we predict the geoposition of a target boat visible in images. Our solution uses recent ML algorithms, the camera-scene geometry and Bayesian filtering. The proposed pipeline first detects and tracks the target boatâ€™s location in the image with the strategy of tracking by detection. This image location is then converted to geoposition to the local sea coordinates referenced to the camera GPS location using plane projective geometry. Finally, target boat local coordinates are transformed to global GPS coordinates to estimate the geoposition. To achieve a smooth geotrajectory, we apply unscented Kalman filter (UKF) which implicitly overcomes small detection errors in the early stages of the pipeline. We tested the performance of our approach using GPS ground truth and show the accuracy and speed of the estimated geopositions. The source code will be made public once the paper is accepted.","Pipelines,DeepTracks,Kalman filters,Object Tracking by Detection,geoposition,Prediction algorithms,global GPS,Bayes methods,Cameras,Bayesian filtering,camera GPS location,pipeline,maritime vehicle geopositioning,Global Positioning System,image location,Unscented Kalman Filter,UKF,Filtering,camera-scene geometry,boats,unscented Kalman filter,Target tracking,cameras,object detection,video signal processing,moving platform,boat detection,marine engineering computing,GPS ground truth,plane projective geometry,local sea coordinates,Plane Projective Geometry,Boats,Geopositioning,GPS location,moving boat,ML algorithms,Deep Learning,target boat local coordinates,"
"maritime anomaly detection and threat assessment","2010","Ships involved in commercial activities tend to follow set patterns of behaviour depending on the business in which they are engaged. If a ship exhibits anomalous behaviour, this could indicate it is being used for illicit activities. With the wide availability of automatic identification system (AIS) data it is now possible to detect some of these patterns of behaviour. Monitoring the possible threat posed by the worldwide movement of ships, however, requires efficient and robust automatic data processing to create a priority list for further investigation. This paper outlines five anomalous ship behaviours: deviation from standard routes, unexpected AIS activity, unexpected port arrival, close approach, and zone entry. For each behaviour, a process is described for determining the probability that it is anomalous. Individual probabilities are combined using a Bayesian network to calculate the overall probability that a specific threat is present.

"cache optimization strategy for mobile edge computing in maritime iot","2022","With the increasing storage capacity of Internet of Things (IoT) mobile devices, cache-enabled device-to-device (D2D) networks enable efficient information sharing, thereby increasing the transmission efficiency of the entire network. The efficiency is further improved by the rational deployment of caching strategies on mobile devices in combination with traditional base station transmission methods. In this paper, the mobile-aware caching strategy is divided into two problems to solve. The first problem is to solve the user's latency-minimizing cache placement problem. We transform the problem into a decision problem, propose a low-complexity algorithm that approximates the optimal solution, and justify the method using the properties of submodular functions. The second problem addresses external restriction parameters, such as cache file type, cache upper limit, and deadline. We find through simulation that there is a bottleneck in the performance improvement of the whole system as the external parameters change. A suitable formulation of these parameters can put the system in a range where the input and output are most effective, further maximizing the performance of the optimization method. We introduce the concept of marginal efficiency and use Bayesian optimization to solve the selection of these parameters.

"a fully-autonomous framework of unmanned surface vehicles in maritime environments using gaussian process motion planning","2023","Unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) are of increasing importance to a growing number of sectors in the maritime industry, including offshore exploration, marine transportation, and defense operations. A major factor in the growth in use and deployment of USVs is the increased operational flexibility that is offered through use of optimized motion planners that generate optimized trajectories. Unlike path planning in terrestrial environments, planning in the maritime environment is more demanding as there is need to assure mitigating action is taken against the significant, random, and often unpredictable environmental influences from winds and ocean currents. With the focus on these necessary requirements as the main basis of motivation, this article proposes a novel motion planner, denoted as Gaussian process motion planning 2 star (GPMP2*), extending the application scope of the fundamental Gaussian-process-based motion planner, Gaussian process motion planning 2 (GPMP2), into complex maritime environments. An interpolation strategy based on Monte Carlo stochasticity has been innovatively added to GPMP2* to produce a new algorithm named GPMP2* with Monte Carlo stochasticity, which can increase the diversity of the paths generated. In parallel with algorithm design, a robotic operating system (ROS)-based fully-autonomous framework for an advanced USV, the Wave Adaptive Modular Vessel 20, has been proposed.

"hybrid bernoulli filtering for detection and tracking of anomalous path deviations","2018","This paper presents a solution to the problem of sequential joint anomaly detection and tracking of a target subject to switching unknown path deviations. Based on a dynamic model described by Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) stochastic processes, the anomaly is represented by a target (e.g., a marine vessel) that deviates from a preset route by changing its nominal mean velocity. The Random Finite Set (RFS) framework is used to represent the switching nature of target's anomalous behavior in the presence of spurious measurements and detection uncertainty. Combining these two ingredients, the problem of jointly detecting target's path deviations and estimating its kinematic state can be formulated within the Bayesian framework, and analytically solved by means of a hybrid Bernoulli filter that sequentially updates the joint posterior density of the unknown OU velocity input (a Bernoulli RFS) and of the target's state random vector. We illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed filter, implemented in Gaussian-mixture form, in a simulated scenario of vessel tracking for maritime traffic monitoring.","Anomaly detection,switching nature,state random vector,Sea measurements,Stochastic processes,Radio frequency,vessel tracking,hybrid Bernoulli filtering,target tracking,Random Finite Set framework,stochastic processes,filtering theory,hybrid Bernoulli filter,Target tracking,object detection,Gaussian processes,Bayesian framework,Artificial intelligence,anomalous path deviations,unknown OU velocity input,nominal mean velocity,Surveillance,marine vessel,joint posterior density,sequential joint anomaly detection,"
"ship trajectory uncertainty prediction based on a gaussian process model","2019","The uncertainty of ship trajectory prediction is addressed. In particular, a probabilistic trajectory prediction model is proposed that describes the uncertainty in future positions along the ship trajectories by continuous probability distributions. The ship motion prediction is decomposed into lateral and longitudinal directions, and position probabilities are calculated along these two directions. A data-driven non-parametric Bayesian model based on a Gaussian Process is proposed to describe the lateral motion uncertainty, while the longitudinal uncertainty results from the uncertainty on the ship acceleration along the route. The parameters of the probabilistic models are derived off-line based on historic trajectory information provided by Automatic Identification System (AIS) data. The model is then applied to predict the trajectory uncertainty in real time by iteratively updating the prior probability models based on new observed AIS data. Moreover, a sequential Cholesky decomposition algorithm is applied in this study to reduce the computational effort required by the Gaussian Process modelling. Three months of AIS data are used to train and test the proposed probabilistic trajectory prediction model. The results obtained show that the proposed method has high prediction accuracy and meets the demands of real-time applications.","Uncertainty modelling,AIS data,Gaussian process,Trajectory prediction,"
"an adaptive hyper parameter tuning model for ship fuel consumption prediction under complex maritime environments","2022","An accurate prediction of ship fuel consumption is critical for speed, trim, and voyage optimisation etc. While previous studies have focused on predicting ship fuel consumption with respect to a variety of factors, research on the impact of environmental factors on fuel consumption has been lacking. In addition, although recent research efforts have widely focused on machine learning methods to predict fuel consumption, studies on hyperparameter values that are suitable for these prediction models are limited. To compensate for this deficiency in existing literature, an adaptive hyperparameter tuning method is proposed, and the effects of maritime environmental factors on fuel consumption are taken into account. Through experimentation, the proposed adaptive hyperparameter tuning method was validated via artificial neural network (ANN), support vector regression (SVR), random forest (RF), and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso). The hyperparameter tuning proportionally increased the amplitudes of the coefficients of determination (R2) of these algorithms. The increase of the amplitude demonstrated the following trend, in the order of the largest increase to the lowest increase: ANN, Lasso, SVM, and RF. The rates of increase were between 0.0773% and 2.1653%. Furthermore, after the environmental factors were considered, the prediction accuracies of the ANN and Lasso increased; however, the opposite was observed for the SVR and RF. As such, we confirmed that the use of Bayesian optimisation for hyperparameter tuning can effectively improve the fuel consumption prediction accuracy, and our proposed model can therefore serve as a significant reference for calculating fuel consumption.","Bayesian optimization,Hyperparameter tuning,Environmental factors,Ship fuel consumption,Artificial neural network,"
"evidence for a “little ice age” glacial advance within the antarctic peninsula – examples from glacially-overrun raised beaches","2021","Recognition of how dynamic the Antarctic ice sheets and glaciers were during the late Holocene has grown in recent years. Proxy data suggests the presence of Neoglacial advances but few moraines or glacial features from this time have been dated compared to glaciated landscapes of the Northern Hemisphere. Debate continues on whether parts of Antarctica experienced glacial advance at the same time as the “Little Ice Age” (LIA), which is well-documented in the Northern Hemisphere. We provide new evidence for late Holocene glacial fluctuations at three locations along the Antarctic Peninsula. A moraine or till sheet from a tidewater glacier cross cuts a series of dated raised beaches at Tay Head, Joinville Island along the northwestern Weddell Sea. At Spark Point, on Greenwich Island, a glacier has overrun Holocene raised beaches and a shell-bearing marine deposit is reworked into a glacial diamicton. A third site in Calmette Bay within the larger Marguerite Bay also contains a recent moraine that cuts across a series of dated raised beach ridges. The new ages constraining these glacial advances are in broad agreement with the handful of other existing ages on moraines and proxy records suggestive of cooler conditions within the Antarctic Peninsula. Combining available timing constraints into a Bayesian model yields an age of 400 to 90 cal BP (1550–1860 CE; 95%) for the LIA across the Antarctica Peninsula. Consideration of a two-phase glacial advance within our Bayesian framework does fit more of the data from across the Antarctic Peninsula and suggests advances from 575 to 330 cal BP (1375–1620 CE) and 400 to 50 cal BP (1550–1900 CE). However, more work is needed to determine if such a two-phase advance occurred. Regardless, its similar timing within the Antarctic Peninsula to that of the Northern Hemisphere supports recent assertions of a volcanic or solar forcing for the LIA. These recent readvances also provide a possible mechanism for changes in the rates of Holocene relative sea-level change recorded across the Antarctic Peninsula suggesting that the Antarctic ice sheets may have been more responsive to past climate changes than previously thought and glacial isostatic adjustment from the LIA and possibly other Holocene glacial oscillations is superimposed upon the longer relaxation from the Last Glacial Maximum.","Coast,Shallow marine,Neoglacial,Sea level,Glacial advance,Holocene,Antarctica,Climate change,"
"intent inference of ship collision avoidance behavior under maritime traffic rules","2021","This paper proposes an algorithm to infer the maneuver intention of an obstacle ship and to check its compliance with the maritime traffic rules to avoid ship collision and ensure maritime traffic safety.

The probabilistic belief of the ship's intention is modeled and quantified using probabilistic tools such as dynamic Bayesian networks.

"bayes' theorem based maritime safety information classifier","2018","In order to ensure the safe navigation of ships, the Global Maritime Distress and Safety System was incorporated into the Safety of Life at Sea regulations, and the amendment has already came into force. Became mandatory for compulsorily fitted craft, the system includes an important Maritime Safety Information Broadcasting System. Nowadays, due to the lack of relevant norms, the seafarers in many sea areas still need to read and identify the theme of the messages artificially, with low efficiency and accuracy. To solve this problem, several machine learning based solutions have been presented and analyzed. However, a mathematically solidly founded naive Bayes classifier did now show its best during the previous research. Thus, the Bayes' Theorem based classifier is explored in detail.

"a bayesian iterative geomagnetic model with universal data input: self-consistent spherical harmonic evolution for the geomagnetic field over the last 4000 years","2019","Changes of the Earth's magnetic field have been observed with varying spatial and temporal resolution since the middle ages by means of compasses, and later by refined mechanical inclination and intensity instruments, until the modern use of quantum mechanical devices and satellite observations. Ancient records, on the other hand, rely on the natural magnetization of archaeological artifacts and other materials, such as rocks and sediments, being therefore indirect, less accurate and sparser. The combination of such heterogeneous records into a single, self-consistent, global model of the geomagnetic field is very challenging: the highly uneven data coverage, both in space and time, requires a careful handling of data uncertainties and error correlations. Previous models dealt with this problem using separated treatments of instrumental data and indirect records, respectively, as well as a different handling of the dipole field component, with respect to non-dipole terms. Here we present a global geomagnetic field model based, for the first time, on the simultaneous inversion of historical, archaeomagnetic, and volcanic records, using a Bayesian approach with minimal-committing time regularization that minimizes the energy of secular variation. A detailed assessment of data uncertainty and error correlation is used to minimize artifacts generated by the appearance of an overwhelming number of incomplete, mostly declination-only records, associated with shipboard measurements in the early colonial period. Our model yields lower dipole energies, which better match modern values, as well as higher non-dipole energies and a stronger secular variation of the dipole moment. Some model artifacts associated with extremely heterogeneous distributions of records in time and space are not completely eliminable and might be caused by incorrect a-priori uncertainty assessments. Alternatively, they might represent an intrinsic limit that can be overcome only by adding new records at critical locations and times.","Geomagnetism,Field modeling,Historical records,Secular variation,Archaeomagnetism,"
"propagation of uncertainty in a simulation-based maritime risk assessment model utilizing bayesian simulation techniques","2003","Recent studies in the assessment of risk in maritime transportation systems have used simulation-based probabilistic techniques. Amongst them are the San Francisco Bay (SFB) Ferry exposure assessment in 2002, the Washington State Ferry (WFS) Risk Assessment in 1998 and the Prince William Sound (PWS) Risk Assessment in 1996. Representing uncertainty in such simulation models is fundamental to quantifying system risk. This paper illustrates the representation of uncertainty in simulation using Bayesian techniques to model input and output uncertainty. These uncertainty representations describe system randomness as well as lack of knowledge about the system.

"assessing possible shifts in wildfire regimes under a changing climate in mountainous landscapes","2013","Climate change may affect the probability of extreme events such as wildfires. Although wildfires are some of the most important ecological processes in forest ecosystems, large-scale wildfires are often perceived as an environmental disaster. Since failure to include the dynamic nature of ecosystems in planning will inevitably lead to unexpected outcomes, we need to enhance our ability to cope with future extreme events coupled with climate change. This study presents several future scenarios in three different time periods for Canada’s Columbia Montane Cordillera Ecoprovince, which is prone to wildfires. These scenarios predict the probability of occurrence of widespread wildfires based on the hierarchical Bayesian model. The model was based on the relationships between wildfires and the Monthly Drought Code (MDC). The MDC is a generalized monthly version of the Daily Drought Code widely used across Canada by forest fire management agencies for monitoring of wildfire risk. To calculate future MDC values, we relied on different possible future conditions of climate, given by the Global Circulation Models. We found a regime shift in drought intensity with abrupt decreases in lightning-caused wildfire activity around 1940, suggesting that future wildfire risks can be inferred primarily from the summer drought code. For future periods, we found increasing trends in the probabilities of large-scale fires with time in most areas. It should be notable that, by the 2080s, there is a probability of some areas having more than 50% of large-scale wildfires under the “average” climatic conditions in the future, indicating that, even without “extreme” weather conditions, some ecosystems will have a fundamental probability of experiencing catastrophic fires under the condition of average summer. However, the rate of progression toward a fire-prone condition is quite different among the three climate change scenarios and among the region analyzed. Given such scenario-sensitive, spatially-heterogeneous patterns of wildfire probability in response to climate variability, management strategy should be flexible and more localized. By drawing on this knowledge, it may be possible to mitigate climate change impacts both before they arise and once they have occurred. These considerations are critical for maintaining the integrity of systems shaped by large-scale natural disturbances to increase their resilience to the changing climate while protecting human society and infrastructures. Working with alternative scenarios will facilitate our adaptation to climate change in managing fire-prone forest ecosystems.","Future climate and fire scenarios,Ecosystem-based management,Wildfire,Extreme drought,Natural disturbance,"
"a stackelberg game-theoretical approach to maritime counter-piracy","2019","In this paper, we provide a maritime counter-piracy framework to represent the strategies put in place and the interaction between a set of actors (patrollers and attackers) in a wide maritime scenario. Specifically, we model the interaction between patrollers and attackers in terms of a Stackelberg leader-follower game. With respect to the previous literature, we provide several innovations, in that we consider moving targets. Moreover, we let the attackers and patrollers ground their decisions not only on the current situation, but also on the expected evolution in the short or medium term. This is done by introducing in the payoff functions some projection terms, i.e., elements able to consider the future evolution of the scenario, up to a specified time window horizon. We conclude this paper with a simulation campaign considering a realistic test bed settled in the Gulf of Aden. Our experiments show that such a prediction is quite effective in generating better decisions allowing the patrollers to dynamically change targets. However, if the time horizon considered in the projection term is too large, we observe that the patrollers tend to patrol the area rather than focusing on specific vessels, and the resulting protection strategy has reduced effectiveness.","wide maritime scenario,moving targets,Bayes methods,specified time window horizon,Games,Stackelberg game-theoretical approach,Game theory,game theory,counter-piracy,maritime counter-piracy framework,Iris,future evolution,Antiterrorism,patrolling,defense strategy,Stackelberg leader-follower game,projection,Airports,Terrorism,"

"bayesian filtering for dynamic anomaly detection and tracking","2022","This article presents a Bayesian approach for sequential detection of anomalies in the motion of a target and joint tracking. The anomaly is modeled as a binary (on/off) switching unknown control input that goes into action (begins to exist, or â€œswitches onâ€) thereby modifying the object dynamics; and by ceasing its activity (becoming nonexistent, or â€œswitching offâ€) returns the dynamics to nominal. The developed Bayesian framework brings together random finite set (RFS) theory to represent the switching nature of the anomaly, and optimal joint input and state estimation to sequentially update a hybrid state that incorporates a random vector for the kinematic state and a Bernoulli RFS for the unknown control input. In addition, a closed-form solution, the Gaussian-mixture hybrid Bernoulli filter (GM-HBF), has been developed to provide a customized solution for dynamic anomaly detection in the maritime domain characterized by linear Gaussian target dynamics. Based on the Ornsteinâ€“Uhlenbeck dynamic model for vessels, where the evolution of the object velocity is governed by a piecewise mean-reverting stochastic process, the anomaly can be represented by a change in the long-run mean velocity (i.e., the unknown control input) from the nominal condition that forces the vessel to deviate from its standard route. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed GM-HBF in both simulated and real-world maritime surveillance applications and test its performance in the face of false measurements, detection uncertainty, and sensor data gaps.","developed Bayesian framework,surveillance,kinematic state,Mathematical models,Anomaly detection,Automatic identification system (AIS),Bayesian approach,random finite sets (RFSs),Bayesian filtering,Bayes methods,object dynamics,linear Gaussian target dynamics,Switches,Bernoulli filter,switching unknown control input,Radio frequency,target tracking,Aerodynamics,stochastic processes,filtering theory,radar,state estimation,detection uncertainty,Gaussian processes,Bernoulli RFS,Radar tracking,maritime anomaly detection,dynamic anomaly detection,joint input and state estimation (JISE),probability,Ornstein-Uhlenbeck dynamic model,GM-HBF,Gaussian-mixture hybrid Bernoulli filter,"

"data-driven financial and operational risk management: empirical evidence from the global tramp shipping industry","2022","The global shipping industry has long suffered from high volatilities in freight rates and bunker fuel prices that lead to significant earnings risks. This paper aims to investigate the effectiveness of financial hedging and operational risk management strategies of 31 world leading tramp shipping companies through a Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) model using various data sources. Operational risk management strategies are categorized into long-term (e.g., fleet diversity and fleet age) and short-to-medium-term (e.g., relative trip distance, fleet repositioning flexibility, and trading diversity) strategies. We innovatively quantify the short-to-medium-term operational risk management strategies using Automatic Identification System (AIS) data. The results show that financial hedging can effectively reduce bunker fuel price risk exposure but cannot reduce freight rate risk exposure. Meanwhile, companies can use operational risk management strategies to effectively reduce both risk exposures.
