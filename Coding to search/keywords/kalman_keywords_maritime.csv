"a self-learning mean optimization filter to improve bluetooth 5.1 aoa indoor positioning accuracy for ship environments","2023","As COVID-19 is still spreading globally, the narrow ship space makes COVID-19 easier for the virus to infect ship passengers. Tracking close contacts remains an effective way to reduce the risk of virus transmission. Therefore, indoor positioning technology should be developed for ship environments. Today, almost all smart devices are equipped with Bluetooth. The Angle of Arrival (AoA) using Bluetooth 5.1 indoor positioning technology is well suited for ship environments. But the narrow ship space and steel walls make the multipath effect more pronounced in ship environments. This also means that more noises are included in the signal. In the Uniform Rectangular Array (URA) type receiving antenna array, elevation and azimuth angles are two important parameters for the AoA indoor positioning technology. Elevation and azimuth angles are unstable because of the influence of noise. In this paper, a Self-Learning Mean Optimization Filter (SLMOF) is proposed. The goal of SLMOF is to find the optimal elevation and azimuth angles as a way to improve the Bluetooth 5.1 AoA indoor positioning accuracy. The experimental results show that the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of SLMOF is 0.44 m, which improves the accuracy by 72% compared to Kalman Filter (KF). This method can be applied to find the optimal average in every dataset.","Indoor positioning,Ship environments,Angle of arrival,Bluetooth,"
"track filtering for space-based maritime surveillance in geographic coordinates","2017","In order to filter tracks of ship targets for space-based maritime surveillance using electronic reconnaissance satellites, an extended Kalman filter (EKF) algorithm in geographic coordinates is proposed in this paper. Firstly, different methods of Dead reckoning (DR) are analysed in different coordinate systems. Then, the formula of EKF based on middle latitude sailing is derived. Finally, satellite-based automatic identification system (AIS) data and simulation data are used to perform track prediction and track filtering respectively, which verifies the validity of the proposed filtering method based on middle latitude sailing.","Satellites,surveillance,Kalman filters,track prediction,extended Kalman filter,Marine vehicles,satellite tracking,middle latitude sailing,space-based maritime surveillance,target tracking,ships,ship target track filtering,EKF algorithm,Target tracking,nonlinear filters,Artificial intelligence,satellite-based automatic identification system,geographic coordinates,dead reckoning,Reconnaissance,Surveillance,electronic reconnaissance satellites,prediction theory,"
"video stabilizing and tracking by horizontal line for maritime cruise ship","2007","It is a key technique to carry out video Stabilizing and object tracking in the Held of marine supervision. This method is based on the new requirements of maritime law enforcement ship. Firstly, It resolve the detection of horizontal line with wavelet transformation. Then, by the combination of horizontal line, image transformations and video platform's feedback, a algorithm of dual compensatory video stabilizing (DCVS) is carried out. Synchronously, with the ubiety of truncation-center and global coordinate system, Kalman filter is used to carry on estimating Truncation-center to finished truncation tracking (TT) of video object.

"real-time multi-object tracking using adaptive filtering and filter banks for maritime applications","2021","This paper presents a novel approach to Multi-Object-Tracking (MOT), which solves the well-known problem of maritime surveillance. We use exteroceptive sensors, such as LiDAR, and Automatic Identification System (AIS), to measure the surroundingsâ€™ Vessels. These objects are associated using evidence theory. Afterward, the proposed algorithm tracks all the objects using a new concept: each object is tracked with a respective filter bank consisting of three Adaptive Extended Kalman Filters (AEKF) as subfilters. These have the same prediction model but different correction algorithms based on various measurement sources. The covariance noise matrices are adapted based on the current measurement quality. The filter banks can overcome drawbacks such as wrong and incomplete measurements, thus improving tracking performance.We have validated the algorithm in real-world scenarios in Rostock Harbor, Germany. The proposed algorithm can track all the objects within the view simultaneously in real-time. By comparing with a reference vessel, the mean 2D position error is ca. 2 m, which is much smaller than the AIS-only solution (5 to 10 m). During the test drive, the filter bank can detect and compensate for incorrect information, such as biased AIS positioning or incomplete LiDAR measurements, to guarantee robust positioning.","covariance matrices,Kalman filters,measurement sources,signal denoising,Prediction algorithms,channel bank filters,respective filter bank,Laser radar,time multiobject tracking,Adaptive Extended Kalman Filters,MultiObject-Tracking,Filter banks,object tracking,Evidence theory,Automatic Identification System,filtering theory,maritime surveillance,Weight measurement,nonlinear filters,maritime applications,Real-time systems,adaptive filtering,size 5.0 m to 10.0 m,wrong measurements,different correction algorithms,tracking performance,Current measurement,geophysical signal processing,current measurement quality,incomplete measurements,size 2.0 m,adaptive filters,oceanographic techniques,"
"obstacle avoidance and target search of an autonomous surface vehicle for 2016 maritime robotx challenge","2017","This paper describes algorithms for Autonomous Surface Vehicle(ASV) obstacle avoidance and target search task. This work is primarily designed for task mission of 2016 Maritime RobotX competition. In this task, ASV must avoid obstacle buoys, while it is searching for totem-shaped buoy. To deal with such problem, algorithms for both perception and motion planning stage was designed. In perception stage, 2D scanning LIDAR and monocular vision sensor are used to detect any floating objects on the water. To recognize target (totem buoy), HSV color space information was used. Detected object (both obstacle and totem buoy) information is tracked by using Kalman filter. In action planning stage, both deliberative and reflexive action [2] planning are designed. In deliberative action planning stage, based on the Kalman filter tracked obstacle information, a grid map can be generated. Using the grid map and A* search algorithm, desired path for searching totem can be calculated. In reflexive action planning stage, once ASV accidently enters hazardous region, where it has high probability of getting collide, it is designed to reflexively escape the region by making pure sway motion.

"a cnn-lstm network for augmenting target detection in real maritime wide area surveillance radar data","2020","Typical radar detectors exploit only a small proportion of the valuable information contained in radar reflections, i.e. magnitude and Doppler. A neural network-based approach for augmenting traditional radar detector structures using machine learning (ML) is proposed in this paper. Specifically, the network is designed to augment target detection in the field of maritime wide area surveillance for non-coherent data. A combination network consisting of a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract spatial features and a long short-term memory (LSTM) for extracting temporal patterns in the spatial features is proposed. The network augments the detector structure by blanking out regions of the frame which are classified as not containing a target, thus reducing false alarms. The network is tested on data containing four marine targets collected by a ground-based radar. The data set was chosen because it contains strong sea clutter returns. When ML is used, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves are shifted to lower probability of false alarm (PFA). A Kalman filter tracker was applied to the ML-augmented and baseline detections, and it was shown that ML-augmented detections produced similar tracks at lower PFA. The feature discovering capability of the network is analyzed through a series of tests, and the argument is made that the CNN-LSTM network presented in this work demonstrates the ability to improve the detection performance by exploiting spatial and temporal information in the data.","real maritime wide area surveillance radar data,detector structure,Kalman filters,marine radar,baseline detections,radar detection,radar clutter,CNN-LSTM network,Feature extraction,ML-augmented detections,LSTM,target detection augmentation,neural nets,target tracking,short-term memory,wide area surveillance radar,Artificial neural networks,CNN,noncoherent data,maritime surveillance,object detection,feature extraction,combination network,search radar,data set,radar imaging,convolutional neural network,detection performance,ground-based radar,neural network-based approach,radar detectors,radar tracking,radar reflections,temporal information,marine targets,probability,Clutter,Object detection,false alarm,traditional radar detector structures,learning (artificial intelligence),spatial features,Detectors,Radar detection,spatial information,"
"sampling-based path planning for cooperative autonomous maritime vehicles to reduce uncertainty in range-only localization","2019","The following letter presents an adaptive path planning algorithm for cooperative localization in the maritime environment. It considers the scenario where an Autonomous Surface Vehicle (ASV) acts as a Communication and Navigation Aid (CNA) to support Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) with range measurements. As AUVs have no access to GPS while submerged, range measurements can bind the otherwise continuously growing navigational error. This can be done by methods such as range-only Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). In such methods, the resulting uncertainty and positional error depends on the geometry between transmitter (CNA) and receiver (AUV). This letter proposes a planning algorithm that combines priority based expansion of a search tree with random sampling-based exploration to position the CNA at strategic positions to transmit ranging messages at optimal times to reduce the uncertainty and error at the AUVsâ€™ position. The approach is validated and shows an increased confidence for AUVsâ€™ localization in simulated environments as well as real experiments using a dataset gathered from AUV Sirius.","Robot localization,cooperating robots,Path planning,Uncertainty,Autonomous underwater vehicles,Acoustic communication,localization,Navigation,motion and path planning,Motion planning,marine robotics,"
"maritime traffic monitoring based on vessel detection, tracking, state estimation, and trajectory prediction","2012","Maneuvering vessel detection and tracking (VDT), incorporated with state estimation and trajectory prediction, are important tasks for vessel navigational systems (VNSs), as well as vessel traffic monitoring and information systems (VTMISs) to improve maritime safety and security in ocean navigation. Although conventional VNSs and VTMISs are equipped with maritime surveillance systems for the same purpose, intelligent capabilities for vessel detection, tracking, state estimation, and navigational trajectory prediction are underdeveloped. Therefore, the integration of intelligent features into VTMISs is proposed in this paper. The first part of this paper is focused on detecting and tracking of a multiple-vessel situation. An artificial neural network (ANN) is proposed as the mechanism for detecting and tracking multiple vessels. In the second part of this paper, vessel state estimation and navigational trajectory prediction of a single-vessel situation are considered.

"integrating inertial and satellite navigation systems to improve performance for a maritime search and rescue aircraft","2003","Inertial navigation systems (INS) are vital for airplanes, spacecraft, missiles, surface or subsurface vessels operating at sea where continuous, accurate and reliable position information, as well as heading, attitude, acceleration and velocity components of the vehicle are provided. INS have the inherent capability of being autonomous; but however, the errors in position coordinates increase unboundedly as a function of time. On the other hand, satellite navigation systems, as well as advanced radio navigation systems, which are available today and which shall be available in the near future, provide very accurate and frequently updated position information. Unfortunately, these data are prone to jamming or being lost due to the limitations of electromagnetic waves, which form the fundamental of their operation. Also, they are not usable for under-sea or under-Earth applications. To eliminate these deficiencies, INS are integrated with satellite or hyperbolic navigation systems that also obtain intermittent position information. This study gives a mathematical treatise on such an integrated system. As a feasible example, a search and rescue aircraft, involved in an expanding area search operation, equipped with strapdown INS and a Global Positioning System is simulated. The INS use two sets of acceleration and rate of rotation sensors. The model used indicates that the error in position information becomes large in time, otherwise it is limited to acceptably low levels if correction information from Global Positioning System is obtained. Improved performance of the INS by the proposed integration can be utilized to use low-cost sensor elements without the loss of accuracy, thereby making INS a feasible outfit for general purposes.","hyperbolic navigation systems,Remotely operated vehicles,Satellite navigation systems,strapdown inertial navigation system,Airplanes,Kalman filters,Inertial navigation,Aircraft navigation,Acceleration,inertial navigation,Global Positioning System,position coordinate errors,radio navigation systems,search and rescue aircraft,missiles,jamming,subsurface vessels,Space vehicles,marine systems,surface vessels,integration,Sea surface,satellite navigation systems,intermittent position information,autonomous navigation system,rotation sensors,spacecraft,helicopters,aerospace computing,SAR helicopter,Missiles,"
"filter-bank approach within tightly-coupled navigation system for integrity enhancement in maritime applications","2021","Navigation systems, estimating the vehicle states with high accuracy, robustness and integrity, are crucial for guidance system in autonomous applications. This publication presents a filter-bank approach designed for a tightly-coupled navigation system, aiming at improving the integrity of the navigation system and the accuracy of the estimated navigation solution under sensor failures. In particular, this navigation system is based on an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and is aided by pseudorange and deltarange-observation of satellite systems, and 3D velocity measurements from a Doppler velocity log (DVL). The designed filter-bank approach proposes a new structure, which handles the challenge of different update rates and measurement delays of the involved sensors. Under IMU failures, the estimated states from the filter bank are reversed to estimate the vehicle acceleration, which improves the IMU bias and state estimation performance at next epochs. The designed approach is validated in a real-time test campaign with an unmanned surface vehicle (USV) in the harbor of Rostock, Germany. During the real-time test, several forms of simulative faults are added to the DVL measurements to evaluate the designed approach. Meanwhile, all necessary sensor data is recorded for further evaluation in post-processing environment. The experimental results show that the designed approach is capable of identifying the simulated sensor failures. Compared with conventional tightly-coupled extended Kalman filter (EKF), the designed approach improves the average horizontal positioning accuracy and its standard deviation under simulative DVL failures by 167% and 771%, respectively.","Satellites,Kalman filters,state estimation performance,guidance system,Safety,channel bank filters,satellite systems,estimated navigation solution,Delays,marine navigation,inertial navigation,Global Positioning System,designed filter-bank approach,Filter banks,integrity enhancement,inertial measurement unit,Three-dimensional displays,state estimation,3D velocity measurements,nonlinear filters,sensors,Real-time systems,vehicle states,Robustness,tightly-coupled navigation system,filter bank,velocity measurement,simulated sensor failures,designed approach,"
"detection of ais messages falsifications and spoofing by checking messages compliance with tdma protocol","2023","Automatic identification system is a navigation aid system that allows vessels to exchange automatically positions, identity and other information. It improves the safety of the maritime traffic and helps to monitor it. However, this system can be manipulated to send falsified information and to mask illicit activities. While previous research has proposed strategies to detect these threats, none of them suggest a solution that considers the time-division multiple access (TDMA) communication protocol. In this work, the compliance of the sent messages with this protocol, specified by the system's standard, is checked for every ship to detect message falsifications. Furthermore, because the ships velocity affects TDMA protocol, a strategy based a Kalman filter is applied to track every ship and to assess the consistency of their velocity data sent. The proposed strategy was validated on real data and showed very promising results. Being computationally cheap, the method can be run in real time.

"deeptracks: geopositioning maritime vehicles in video acquired from a moving platform","2021","Geopositioning and tracking a moving boat at sea is a very challenging problem, requiring boat detection, matching and estimating its GPS location from imagery with no common features. The problem can be stated as follows: given imagery from a camera mounted on a moving platform with known GPS location as the only valid sensor, we predict the geoposition of a target boat visible in images. Our solution uses recent ML algorithms, the camera-scene geometry and Bayesian filtering. The proposed pipeline first detects and tracks the target boatâ€™s location in the image with the strategy of tracking by detection. This image location is then converted to geoposition to the local sea coordinates referenced to the camera GPS location using plane projective geometry. Finally, target boat local coordinates are transformed to global GPS coordinates to estimate the geoposition. To achieve a smooth geotrajectory, we apply unscented Kalman filter (UKF) which implicitly overcomes small detection errors in the early stages of the pipeline. We tested the performance of our approach using GPS ground truth and show the accuracy and speed of the estimated geopositions.

"psr-based feature adaptation with anomaly re-prediction for maritime target tracking","2022","The tracking method for the relevant filter cannot track when the target is affected by the background and in the scene of occlusion. We propose a target tracking algorithm based on the peak-to-sidelobe ratio (PSR) feature weight adaptation with anomaly re-detection based on the efficient convolution operator for manual features (ECO_HC) algorithm. The weights of the HOG features and CN features corresponding to the peak-to-sidelobe ratio are used as dynamic weight coefficients, and the maximum response value after their fusion is the area where the target may appear. Determine the target tracking status by calculating the tracking confidence of the response map, and when there is a tracking anomaly, the ECO_HC tracker is enhanced using the Kalman filter to re-predict the target position. The proposed algorithm has experimented on the OTB-50 dataset. The results show that our algorithm can cope with complex scenarios and improves by 3.0% in tracking accuracy and 2.8% in tracking success rate compared with the baseline algorithm ECO_HC.

"kalman filter based precoding approach for inter-beam interference cancellation in maritime mtc satellite","2021","The Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite for the maritime Machine Type Communication (MTC) is usually equipped with a multi-beam antenna and uses full frequency multiplexing which can increase communication capacity. However, it brings serious inter-beam interference. In this regard, precoding technique is considered to eliminate inter-beam interference. However, conventional precoding algorithms represented by direct inversion bring higher complexity. To this end, we combine the system signal model with the Kalman filter equation and propose a precoding scheme without training sequence in the form of Kalman filter. This scheme can obtain an approximated matrix of the channel inverse matrix. Firstly, we define the channel matrix as the measurement parameter and the precoding matrix as the Kalman state. Then, the difference between the received signal and the transmitted signal is defined as the difference of the Kalman equation as a control factor combined with the Kalman gain. Finally, minimizing control factor through a finite number of iterations to generate the optimum precoding matrix.

To do so, five classical machine learning methods (i.e., Kalman Filter, Gaussian Process Regression, Support Vector Regression, Random Forest, and Back Propagation Network) and eight deep learning methods (i.e., Recurrent Neural Networks, Long Short-Term Memory, Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory, Gate Recurrent Unit, Bi-directional Gate Recurrent Unit, Sequence to Sequence, Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network, and Transformer) are thoroughly analysed and compared from the algorithm essence and applications to excavate their features and adaptability for manned and unmanned ships. The findings reveal the characteristics of various prediction methods and provide valuable implications for different stakeholders to guide the best-fit choice of a particular method as the solution under a specific circumstance. It also makes contributions to the extraction of the research difficulties of ship trajectory prediction and the corresponding solutions that are put forward to guide the development of future research.","Deep learning,Maritime safety,Hybrid maritime traffic,Trajectory prediction,AIS data,Machine learning,"
"maritime environment perception based on deep learning","2022","Environment perception is an essential aspect of automated maritime vehicles, especially in high-traffic areas. In recent years, deep-learning-based object detection using LiDAR has been well developed in the automotive sector but has not yet seen a similar level of sophisticated development in maritime applications. In these applications, LiDAR detection should be fused with other maritime navigation systems such as the automatic identification system (AIS) to expand the detection range. To address this, we propose a novel deep-learning-based concept for maritime environment perception by using LiDAR as a primary sensor and AIS as an assisting information source. This approach consists of three functional modules: object detection, multi-object tracking, and static environment mapping. For object detection, we apply a convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect floating objects represented as oriented bounding boxes. To train the CNN, we propose a method that generates simulated labeled datasets. The detected objects from CNN are tracked with Kalman Filter banks. The remaining LiDAR data points are treated as static environments and represented by polygons. We evaluated the approach by using simulative and real-world datasets. In the simulation, the average precision of the CNN object detector reaches 60.8%, with a data processing rate of 40 Hz in GPU. Our real-world evaluations show that this approach can track 83% of the vessels in a crowded harbor, with the overall intersection over union reaching 64%. Our proposed approach represents the first application of CNN for LiDAR-based maritime environment perception, demonstrating its high potential for future online and real-world applications.","high-traffic areas,real-world applications,static environment mapping,Kalman filters,CNN object detector,automated maritime vehicles,deep-learning-based concept,static environments,Laser radar,neural nets,frequency 40.0 Hz,deep learning,object tracking,automatic identification system,LiDAR detection,Intelligent vessels,supervised learning,maritime navigation,AIS,object detection,sophisticated development,image classification,Radar tracking,Artificial intelligence,convolutional neural network,optical radar,Point cloud compression,Radar,maritime applications,maritime navigation systems,detection range,LiDAR-based maritime environment perception,multi-object tracking,Object detection,deep-learning-based object detection,multiobject tracking,learning (artificial intelligence),remaining LiDAR data points,Detectors,"

"enhancing the reliability of shipborne ins/gnss integrated navigation system during abnormal sampling periods using bi-lstm and robust ckf","2023","Developing a reliable navigation system is a crucial challenge for intelligent ships. Integrating Inertial Navigation Systems (INS) with shipborne Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) provides a viable solution. However, the system's reliability heavily relies on GNSS availability. This paper proposes a method to enhance the reliability of shipborne INS/GNSS integrated navigation systems during GNSS abnormal sampling periods. The proposed method consists of two parts. Firstly, using specially designed input and output parameters, a pseudo-GNSS prediction model based on a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network (Bi-LSTM) is constructed to generate predicted pseudo-GNSS measurements during periods of GNSS loss, effectively filling in the gaps left by the absence of actual GNSS data. Secondly, Huber's M-estimation-based Robust Cubature Kalman filter (RCKF) is integrated into the data fusion algorithm, and a switching mechanism between RCKF and the Cubature Kalman filter (CKF) is established based on the source of GNSS data utilized for measurement update, to mitigate the impact of non-Gaussian distribution prediction noise introduced by pseudo-GNSS prediction model. Experimental validation using real ship navigation data in a natural marine environment confirms the proposed method's capability to maintain navigation accuracy during GNSS loss for shipborne INS/GNSS integrated navigation systems. The algorithm's superiority becomes more evident as the duration of GNSS loss increases, underscoring its effectiveness in enhancing shipborne integrated navigation system reliability.","Bi-LSTM,Intelligent ship,GNSS loss,Robust CKF,Navigation reliability,Ship integrated navigation,"
"a data processing method of maritime surveillance radar on mechanical and electronical scanning mode","2020","The maritime surveillance radar is prone to have the problems of false track initiation and tracking loss due to the low tracking accuracy of the target using the traditional data processing strategy. To solve these problems, a data processing strategy is proposed based on a mechanical and electronical scanned radar. As the problem of velocity ambiguity is caused by far detection distance and low pulse repetition frequency (PRF), the overlapping algorithm is used and the corresponding constraints are employed for optimization. The problem of too many false tracks as a result of background noise is solved by using Hough transform and logic-based algorithm optimized under the relevant constraints. In addition, an optimization method of Kalman filtering is proposed based on the predicted value of the stable course of maritime targets to solve track jitter. The results of experiment show that this strategy is effective and improves the accuracy of radar in locating and tracking targets.","false tracks,electronical scanned radar,Kalman filters,marine radar,mechanical scanning mode,logic-based algorithm,radar detection,low pulse repetition frequency,target tracking,data processing method,false track initiation,tracking loss,track jitter,mechanical scanned radar,Kalman filtering,Hough transforms,object detection,optimisation,maritime targets,search radar,jitter,velocity ambiguity,overlapping algorithm,radar tracking,maritime surveillance radar,Hough transform,data processing strategy,electronical scanning mode,"
"analysis of local observability for feature localization in a maritime environment using an omnidirectional camera","2007","Autonomous operation by a surface vehicle in a maritime setting requires that the surface vehicle detects non-water objects, including shoreline, hazards to navigation, and other moving vessels. In order to assess the utility of an omnidirectional camera for detecting and localizing non- water objects, we rigorously investigate observability of both stationary and moving features. For stationary features, we find that all but a small subset of the features are observable. For moving features, we show that an important class of feature and ASV trajectories are not observable.","Remotely operated vehicles,Kalman filters,remotely operated vehicles,robot vision,Cameras,nonlinear systems,observability,Simultaneous localization and mapping,nonwater object detection,Observability,Vehicle detection,stationary features,omnidirectional camera,nonlinear control systems,local observability analysis,Mobile robots,moving features,Instruments,Hazards,maritime environment,mobile robots,autonomous surface vehicle operation,Object detection,Navigation,ASV kinematics,marine vehicles,robot kinematics,feature localization,"
"real-time tld target tracking algorithm based on improved kernel correlation filtering for maritime targets","2022","Aiming at the problem that the traditional KCF algorithm cannot adapt to the long-term target tracking in a complex offshore environment, TLD is a combination of track detection learning module tracking algorithms, which can carry out long-term target tracking, but its real-time performance needs to be improved. Based on the framework of the TLD target tracking algorithm, the tracking module adopts the improved multi-feature fusion and scale adaptive KCF algorithm, adaptive Kalman filter algorithm is used to predict the target position of the detection module, and the detection area is reduced. The detection speed of the algorithm is improved, and the detection results of occlusion detection and position estimation are used to modify the tracking results. In order to improve the accuracy of the tracker, an improved filtering template updating strategy is proposed. To improve the accuracy of the tracker, a new filtering template updating strategy is proposed. Then the accuracy and success rate of the proposed algorithm are verified on OTB50 dataset. Finally, a practical tracking experiment is carried out.

"ais data-driven ship trajectory prediction modelling and analysis based on machine learning and deep learning methods","2023","Maritime transport faces new safety challenges in an increasingly complex traffic environment caused by large-scale and high-speed ships, particularly with the introduction of intelligent and autonomous ships. It is evident that Automatic Identification System (AIS) data-driven ship trajectory prediction can effectively aid in identifying abnormal ship behaviours and reducing maritime risks such as collision, stranding, and contact. Furthermore, trajectory prediction is widely recognised as one of the critical technologies for realising safe autonomous navigation. The prediction methods and their performance are the key factors for future safe and automatic shipping. Currently, ship trajectory prediction lacks the real performance measurement and analysis of different algorithms, including classical machine learning and emerging deep learning methods. This paper aims to systematically analyse the performance of ship trajectory prediction methods and pioneer experimental tests to reveal their advantages and disadvantages as well as fitness in different scenarios involving complicated systems. To do so, five machine learning methods (i.e., Kalman Filter (KF), Support Vector Progression (SVR), Back Propagation network (BP), Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), and Random Forest (RF)) and seven deep learning methods (i.e., Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gate Recurrent Unit (GRU), Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM), Sequence to Sequence (Seq2seq), Bi-directional Gate Recurrent Unit (Bi-GRU), and Transformer) are first extracted from the state-of-the-art literature review and then employed to implement the trajectory prediction and compare their prediction performance in the real world. Three AIS datasets are collected from the waters of representative traffic features, including a normal channel (i.e., the Chengshan Jiao Promontory), complex traffic (i.e., the Zhoushan Archipelago), and a port area (i.e., Caofeidian port). They are selected to test and analyse the performance of all twelve methods based on six evaluation indexes and explore the characteristics and effectiveness of the twelve trajectory prediction methods in detail. The experimental results provide a novel perspective, comparison, and benchmark for ship trajectory prediction research, which not only demonstrates the fitness of each method in different maritime traffic scenarios, but also makes significant contributions to maritime safety and autonomous shipping development.","Deep learning,Maritime safety,Trajectory prediction,AIS data,Machine learning,"
"application of the jpda-ukf to hfsw radars for maritime situational awareness","2012","At the present day, growing interest is paid to the development of more reliable surveillance systems for maritime situational awareness (MSA). The purpose is to detect, track and classify cooperative and non-cooperative targets. For this reason, great interest is given to low-power/cost High-Frequency Surface-Wave (HFSW) radars as an early-warning tool for over-the-horizon (OTH) applications. However, in HFSW radars there is a trade-off in terms of quality and cost, i.e. the radar system exhibits poor azimuth resolution, high non-linearity, and significant false alarm rate. All these aspects reduce tracking performance if not properly addressed. In this context, the Joint Probabilistic Data Association (JPDA) with the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) is proposed. The tracking algorithm behavior is investigated by a comparison between the tracks generated by two HFSW radars, with overlapped fields of view, and Automatic Identification System (AIS) data. A discussion is provided about the possible effectiveness of HFSW radar fusion strategies. Preliminary results from a HFSW Radar experiment are reported and discussed.","HFSW radar fusion strategy,tracking algorithm behavior,sensor fusion,Kalman filters,marine radar,over-the-horizon application,HFSW Radar,Marine vehicles,Radar measurements,false alarm rate,Sea measurements,joint probabilistic data association,Multi-Target Tracking,maritime situational awareness,high-frequency surface-wave radar,target tracking,automatic identification system,Maritime Surveillance,unscented Kalman filter,Target tracking,OTH application,High Clutter Environment,Radar tracking,Data Association,Unscented Kalman filter,JPDA-UKF,probability,azimuth resolution,Clutter,noncooperative target,MSA,AIS data,"
"lidar extended object tracking of a maritime vessel using an ellipsoidal contour model","2018","Extended object tracking (EOT) plays an important role when creating autonomous systems like self-driving cars or surface vehicles. For accurate estimation of the target extent, it is important to have a sensor with high resolution and low measurement noise. In this paper we use the LIDAR sensor to track a single elliptical target in clutter with a contour measurement model. The model enables the use of extended Kalman filter (EKF) which is combined with a generalized probabilistic data association (GPDA) filter. The EKF method comes favorably out of a comparison with a random matrix parametrized EOT approach.

"research on maritime target tracking for high frequency over-the-horizon radar","2020","High frequency over-the-horizon radar(HFOTHR) is an effective method to detect targets below the horizon without the limitation of curvature of the earth.

With the increasing application of HFOTHR, the detection environment is more complicated and the requirement for real-time becomes more urgent.
