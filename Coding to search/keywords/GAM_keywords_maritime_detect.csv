"gammaex project: a solution for cbrn remote sensing using unmanned aerial vehicles in maritime environments","2017","Nowadays Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) agents are real threats, and they can be released from intentional and non-intentional sources. Intentional sources include weapons of mass destruction, and they can inflict serious amount of damage. CBRN non-intentional sources can go from disease outbreaks or even incidents, such as a nuclear accident. The interest for unmanned vehicles is growing more and more, either in military or civilian applications. In this scenario, they can be applied, especially Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The response to CBRN releases should follow several steps, such as reconnaissance of the affected area, detection of the agent, sampling, decontamination, victim screening, medical evacuation, identification of the type of agent and medical treatment. Therefore, UAVs can be an important asset in this scenario, as they bring many advantages, such as the access to inhospitable or inaccessible spaces, incorporation of sensors that can be used to identify the agent, and many other factors that increase the speed of the task, reducing at the same time the risk to personnel. In this paper, an UAV system is presented to fulfill the requirements of this issue, including the vehicle, sensors and control station. This system was tested and the validation tests are also represented. It proved to be an asset in CBRN releases, either intentional or non-intentional.","unmanned aerial vehicles,remote sensing,Robotics,military systems,Chemical and biological sensors,weapons of mass destruction,maritime environments,CBRN nonintentional sources,Remote Sensing,Biology,ATEX,autonomous aerial vehicles,Reconnaissance,weapons,Chemicals,Unmanned aerial vehicles,GammaEx project,Unmanned Systems,mobile robots,national security,CBRN,UAV system,Chemical sensors,marine control,CBRN agents,CBRN remote sensing,chemical biological radiological and nuclear agents,"
"temperature and salinity trends in the northern limit of the canary current upwelling system","2023","Thermohaline time series are crucial for detecting and quantifying abiotic changes in the marine environment, and even more so in the present global change scenario. This is particularly relevant for the Ría the Vigo and its adjacent shelf, a highly productive ecosystem at the northern limit of the Canary Current Upwelling System (CanCUS). This study analyses a 34-year time series (1987–2020) of Conductivity-Temperature-Depth (CTD) casts, the longest series available to date in the region. Long-term trends, shifts, and seasonal variability of temperature and salinity were assessed and investigated in relation to regional meteorological variability and basin-scale atmospheric teleconnection indices. Generalized Additive Models (GAM) allowed us to determine that monthly thermohaline variability can be largely explained by regional meteo-climatic variability, mainly upwelling index and river discharge. Trends and shifts in some teleconnection patterns, especially the East Atlantic (EA) pattern, may also be related to both the shift in salinity in 2013 and its long-term decrease below 50 m depth. Despite the current global warming context, no statistically significant trend was observed for either the upwelling index or temperature. The spatial analysis of sea surface temperature trends suggests that our study area has been responding to climate change differently from other surrounding near-shore areas, as the Finisterre Cape or the southern Bay of Biscay. Overall, this study highlights the importance of long-term observations to elucidate the impact of climate change in the northern limit of the CanCUS and encourages caution when extrapolating conclusions from ecosystem studies on a regional scale.",""
"sea fog attenuation analysis of white-led light sources for maritime vlc","2019","Maritime VLC has features of high speed, low cost and anti-EMI. The scattering attenuation of sea fog particles for white-LED light source will directly affect the signal transmission. Due to meteorological effects, much physical detail could be lost in Maritime VLC. Effects of changes in the particle size distributions and influences of different sources cannot easily be taken into account. To address this issue, this paper presents scattering spectrum analysis of sea fog particles and attenuation of maritime VLC channel systematically. Firstly, based on sea fog parameters, the scattering, extinction and phase functions of sea fog particles can be calculated by employing Mie theory. Furthermore, scattering analysis of sea fog particle swarm could be evaluated. Then transmission attenuation of wide spectrum white-LED is analyzed by utilizing revised Gamma distribution. According to the sensitivity of the receiver detector in visible light band, the change of white light transmission spectrum is weighted. At last, combined with the white LED spectrum collected by the experiment, simulations describe that spectrum changes of white LED are obtained after transmission for a certain distance.","visible light band,receiver detector,particle size,particle size distributions,scattering functions,Absorption,sea fog particles,light emitting diodes,Gamma distribution,antiEMI,Mie theory,scattering analysis,scattering attenuation,scatting,optical links,fog sea,meteorological effects,fog,signal transmission,Atmospheric modeling,Scattering,free-space optical communication,Attenuation,scattering spectrum analysis,extinction functions,light attenuation,maritime VLC channel,sea fog particle swarm,Particle swarm optimization,Mie scattering,Atmospheric measurements,sea fog attenuation analysis,electromagnetic interference,underwater optical wireless communication,maritime transmission,light transmission,white LED spectrum,white light transmission spectrum,sea fog parameters,wide spectrum white-LED,transmission attenuation,white-LED light source,phase functions,Light emitting diodes,wide spectrum,"
"fitting empirical distributions for vessels behavioural analysis and maritime anomaly detection","2023","Naval behaviour characterization and maritime anomaly detection represents two active area of research. Although multiple probabilistic approaches have been implemented for explaining different parametric maritime phenomena, most of them are focused only on the analysis of primary kinematic data, such as position, speed, course of vessels, or lateral displacement relative to an obstacle. This article presents an analysis on multiple complex maritime activities (e.g., fishing, drifting, hidden activities) that were derived by processing AIS messages collected in the Black Sea region. Quantitative histograms were made for each type of activity while probability and cumulative distribution functions were plotted using kernel density estimation applications. After that, multiple evaluation metrics analysed the possibilities of representing these distributions in the form of known parametric distributions (e.g., Gaussian, Gamma, Rayleigh, Log-normal). Finally, there were extracted the parameters that best fitted these distributions. Also, a universal parametric distribution was searched to best fit all observed maritime activities.","statistical distributions,universal parametric distribution,kernel density estimation applications,Safety,primary kinematic data,AIS messages,vessel behavioural analysis,Sea measurements,cumulative distribution functions,parametric maritime phenomena,probabilistic approaches,quantitative histograms,marine engineering,hidden activities,AIS,vessels behaviour,Probabilistic logic,Probability distribution,probability distribution fitting,Measurement,maritime anomaly detection,Statistical analysis,empirical distributions,naval behaviour characterization,Fitting,Black Sea region,empirical data,data handling,multiple complex maritime activities,"
"green rf/fso communications in cognitive relay-based space information networks for maritime surveillance","2019","In this paper, we provide an overview of a space-based network for the maritime surveillance information sharing and evaluate the coverage, the throughput and the real-time reception capacity of the presented systems. The focus is on the feeder link of a multi-hop geostationary satellite system. We propose a cognitive relay-based architecture for the inter-satellite and satellite-to-ground communication with a multi-band spectrum sensing operating on both free-space optical (FSO) and radio frequency (RF) bands. Furthermore, modeling the spectrum sensing energy as a Gamma distribution we derive the formula of the network energy consumption in presence of multipath fading and considering two different data relay schemes: amplify-and-forward (AF) and decode-and-forward (DF). We prove that the RF/FSO communication in the proposed relay-based architecture enhances the data transmission increasing the throughput and the real-time reception capacity and reducing the network energy consumption. The performance evaluation shows that the DF scheme overcomes the AF one in terms of energy consumption while the AF scheme overcomes the DF one in terms of probability detection, both experience the same throughput. Finally, the proposed novel architecture has been compared with existing ones showing that it enhances the current maritime surveillance systems by jointly optimizing communication functionalities.","inter-satellite communication,surveillance,telecommunication power management,cognitive radio,real-time reception capacity,multi-hop networks,satellite systems,Marine vehicles,radio frequency free-space optical communications,cognitive relay-based networks,radio spectrum management,green RF/FSO communications,free-space optical communication,Satellite communication,detection probability,network energy consumption,marine engineering,optimisation,coverage evaluation,amplify-and-forward,multiband spectrum sensing,feeder link,decode-and-forward,maritime surveillance information sharing,space information networks,multihop geostationary satellite system,Spread spectrum communication,relay networks (telecommunication),decode and forward communication,data relay,satellite links,Maritime surveillance,signal detection,satellite-to-ground communication,Surveillance,throughput,RF/FSO communication,multipath fading,network energy,amplify and forward communication,oceanographic techniques,"
"antenna beampattern matched optimum coherent detection in high-resolution mechanically scanning maritime surveillance radars","2023","Mechanically scanning radars are still widely used in ocean guard and surveillance areas nowadays, owing to simple structure, light weight and low cost. The antenna rotation causes amplitude modulation of target returns along pulses by the antenna azimuth beampattern. The traditional coherent detection that ignores this modulation suffers from some performance loss. In this article, an antenna beampattern matched optimum coherent detector and a dual-threshold detection scheme are proposed for high-resolution mechanically scanning maritime surveillance radars. First, it is shown that the modulation of target returns is determined by the antenna azimuth beampattern, scan rate, and pulse repetition interval and the antenna scanning also affect the temporal correlation of sea clutter. Second, the antenna beampattern matched optimum coherent detector is given in compound-Gaussian sea clutter with inverse Gamma distributed texture and the pulse scanning mode is used to deal with unknown target azimuth angle in the matched filter. Third, to mitigate the high computational cost of the pulse scanning mode, a dual-threshold scheme is given, which searches all pulse-range cells by short-time integration and further confirms suspected cells whose test statistics are between the two lower and higher thresholds in the search by long-time integration. Moreover, two fast recursive clutter covariance matrix inversion algorithms along pulses and range cells are presented, which bring a great reduction in computational complexity. Finally, real measured radar data is used to verify the proposed detector and scheme and the experimental results show that it behaves better in detection of small targets than the traditional detectors.","Antennas,covariance matrices,maritime surveillance radars,Radar antennas,mechanically scanning maritime surveillance radars,radar detection,radar clutter,high-resolution mechanically scanning maritime surveillance,compound-Gaussian sea clutter,sea clutter,amplitude modulation,target returns,dual-threshold detection scheme,matched filter,optimum coherent detector,scan rate,surveillance areas,ocean guard,gamma distribution,traditional coherent detection,dual-threshold scheme,Antenna beampattern matched optimum coherent detection,Gaussian processes,matrix inversion,search radar,measured radar data,unknown target,Radar,radar signal processing,antenna azimuth beampattern,antenna beampattern matched optimum coherent detection,high computational cost,azimuth beampattern modulation,Doppler radar,computational complexity,Clutter,scanning radars,fast recursive clutter covariance matrix inversion algorithms,pulse scanning mode,antenna rotation,Surveillance,pulse-range cells,antenna scanning,pulse repetition interval,Radar detection,"
"visual drone detection and tracking for autonomous operation from maritime vessel","2022","To allow incorporation of autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV's/drones) into maritime military operations, it is critical to be able to accurately localize the UAV with respect to the moving maritime vessel during the take-off and landing phases. This work addresses the study and implementation of a visual detection, tracking and three-dimensional positioning method for a specific drone from a moving maritime vessel. The YOLOv5 detector and the OceanPlus tracker have been trained on a custom dataset with good performance in accuracy and processing time. The drone's position with respect to the vessel is estimated by applying stereo triangulation to the centres of the bounding boxes returned by the object detectors and trackers. The performance of the proposed positioning method was evaluated in a realistic simulated environment in the Unreal Game Engine. The proposed method allows detection, tracking, and positioning of a target drone at ranges exceeding 100m while achieving positioning errors below 10cm during landing phases.","stereo triangulation,maritime vessel,object detectors,three-dimensional positioning method,take-off and landing phases,mesh generation,robot vision,Games,autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles,Sea measurements,military computing,OceanPlus tracker,object tracking,visuasl tracking,military robotics,Target tracking,object detection,position control,stereo image processing,maritime military operations,visual drone detection,unreal game engine,Robots,Autonomous aerial vehicles,YOLOv5 detector,convolutional neural nets,autonomous aerial vehicles,marine engineering computing,Tracking,Object Detection,mobile robots,Visualization,computer games,visual drone tracking,marine control,autonomous operation,Detectors,UAV,synthetic data,"
