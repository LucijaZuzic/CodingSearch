"a novel semi-supervised learning approach for state of health monitoring of maritime lithium-ion batteries","2023","Lithium-ion batteries are a prominent technology for the electrification of the transport sector, which itself is a key measure towards the departure from fossil fuels. The “green shift” is taking place in the marine industry too, where the number of battery-powered vessels is fastly growing. In this case, monitoring the battery State of Health is essential more than ever to optimise battery use, promote safety, and ensure the coverage of ship power and energy demands. Classification societies typically require annual capacity tests for this purpose; however, the tests are disruptive, costly and time-consuming. As a consequence they are seldom, in addition to not being always fully reliable. We propose a novel alternative semi-supervised learning approach to estimate the State of Health of a lithium-ion battery system with no labelled data, starting from a minimal set of weakly labelled data from another similar system. The method is based on operational sensor data gathered from the battery, together with the battery State of Charge. Our results show that the procedure is valid, and the obtained estimates can be used to significantly progress in failure prevention, operational optimisation, and for planning batteries at the design stage.","State of Health monitoring,Data-driven modelling,Multivariable Fractional Polynomial regression,Maritime battery systems,Semi-supervised learning,"
"a novel quality control method of time-series ocean wave observation data combining deep-learning prediction and statistical analysis","2023","Quality control (QC) of marine data is a critical aspect in ensuring the usability of oceanic data. In this paper, we propose a novel QC method for time-series ocean wave data, which combines deep learning prediction and statistical analysis. Our method first realizes multi-element LSTM prediction of the time-series ocean wave observation data, capturing both temporal consistency and physical relationships between the multi-element inputs. Then, it applies peak detection on the regional mean difference ratio derived from the predicted and true values of the ocean wave data, and finally labels the anomalous data points based on peak detection results. We conducted experiments on the time-series wave data of four sites from the National Marine Science Center, China, and compared our proposed method with traditional QC method that is currently used for operational marine data quality control, as well as classic anomaly detection models including Isolation Forest and VAE-LSTM. The results show a significant improvement in the Precision, Recall, and F1 Score for erroneous samples using our proposed method. Our proposed method takes advantages of both deep learning and statistical analysis and considers physical correlation of multiple elements of marine data, effectively addressing the problem of erroneous discrimination of abnormal sea conditions in the traditional method, and providing valuable insights for the study of marine time-series observational data.","Deep-learning prediction,Time-series data,Statistical analysis,Quality control,"
"maritime anomaly detection in a real-world scenario: ever given grounding in the suez canal","2022","In this paper we present how automatic maritime anomaly detection tools can be successfully applied in real-world situations such as the major event of the container vessel Ever Given, which grounded in the Suez Canal on March 23rd 2021. The anomaly detector is designed to process the available sequence of Automatic Identification System (AIS) reports, information from ground-based or satellite radar systems if available, and contextual information defining the expected nominal behavior of navigation. A statistical hypothesis testing procedure is sequentially run to decide whether or not a deviation from the nominal behavior happened within a specific time period, for instance two consecutive data points. We show, based on the recorded AIS data from the Ever Given, that the proposed detector could have been triggered and alerted to anomalous behavior fully 19 minutes before the grounding.","anomaly detector,Anomaly detection,Marine vehicles,Grounding,statistical hypothesis testing,Ever Given grounding,automatic maritime anomaly detection tools,statistical analysis,Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process,Testing,ships,Containers,automatic identification system,radar,maritime surveillance,satellite radar systems,contextual information,container vessel,Suez Canal,Artificial intelligence,ground-based system,marine engineering computing,Maritime anomaly detection,Irrigation,statistical hypothesis testing procedure,expected nominal behavior,AIS data,"
"ship anti-grounding with a maritime autonomous surface ship and digital twin of port of hamburg","2023","We present the virtual demonstration of a novel ship Anti-Grounding Service in a digital twinned use case scenario in the Port of Hamburg. The scenario is generated from real bathymetry survey data collected in the Port. The virtual model of a Maritime Autonomous Surface Ship travels the route ahead of merchant ships on approach to the Port and is integrated with a real-time high-resolution Multibeam SONAR Simulator that synthesizes underkeel survey data. The automated data processing workflow detects potential grounding hazards in the synthetic survey data and provides a real-time update of the Port nautical chart, which is presented in the Electronic Chart Display and Information System of a Ship Handling Simulator. Our method is the first to consider Multibeam SONAR equipped Maritime Autonomous Surface Ship platforms for provision of ship Anti-Grounding Services. The results validate the full-scale simulation and automated hazard detection workflow and incorporate tests conducted with certified mariners (N=10) to address human factors of introducing new technologies into safety critical situations. The key contributions of this work are summarized as: 1) Validation of Maritime Autonomous Surface Ships as an Anti-Grounding Service delivery platform; 2) Demonstration of a Digital Twin for hydrography survey and bottom hazard detection; and 3) Experimental validation with certified mariners of the anti-grounding service Human-Computer Interface on the ship bridge.","digital twinned use case scenario,automated data processing workflow,ship antigrounding service,underkeel survey data,electronic chart display,Bridges,human factors,bathymetry survey data,safety,grounding hazards,antigrounding service delivery platform,hydrography,Surveys,digital twins,ships,marine safety,maritime autonomous surface ship platforms,autonomous,port nautical chart,synthetic survey data,Seaports,object detection,automated hazard detection workflow,simulation,digital twin,ship handling simulator,sonar,unmanned vehicle,Autonomous aerial vehicles,bathymetry,Real-time systems,antigrounding service human-computer interface,real-time high-resolution multibeam SONAR simulator,merchant ship,Hazards,hazards,Hamburg port,SONAR,ports,navigation,Digital twins,merchant ships,oceanographic techniques,ship bridge,"
"detecting outlier pairs in complex network based on link structure and semantic relationship","2017","In this paper, we propose an outlier pair detection method, called LSOutPair, which discovers the vast differences between link structure and semantic relationship. LSOutPair addresses three important challenges: (1) how can we measure the target object's link similarity among multi-typed objects and multi-typed relations? (2) how can we measure the semantic similarity using the short texts? (3) how can we find the objects’ maximum differences between link structure and semantic relationship? To tackle these challenges, LSOutPair applies three main techniques: (1) two matrices are used to store link similarity and semantic similarity, (2) a k-step index algorithm, which calculates the term weighting for each object, (3) applying the linear transformation of Frobenius norm to matrices can obtain the top-K outlier pairs. LSOutPair considers link and semantics in complex network simultaneously, which is a new attempt in data mining. Substantial experiments show that LSOutPair is very effective for outlier pair detection.","Complex network,Semantic relationship,Outlier pair detection,-step index,Link structure,"
"intensified aridity over the indo-pacific warm pool controlled by ice-sheet expansion during the last glacial maximum","2022","The magnitude, direction and cause of precipitation changes across the Indo-Pacific Warm Pool (IPWP) during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) remain elusive. In particular, it is still inconclusive whether tropical or extra-tropical factors controlled such precipitation changes. Determining the spatio-temporal distribution of precipitation in the IPWP during the LGM is a valid strategy to address this issue, but the existing precipitation records are dominantly from maritime continents and marginal seas, with few data from pelagic oceans. In order to fill this gap, we analyzed the oxygen isotopic compositions of single Ethmodiscus rex diatom frustules (δ18OE. rex) from a sediment core (WPD-03) consisting of laminated diatom mats (LDMs) in the eastern Philippine Sea (EPS). δ18OE. rex was controlled mainly by sea-surface salinity variation and, thus, can reflect open-ocean precipitation changes across the IPWP. Our precipitation proxy records, in combination with existing published data, reveal spatial patterns of precipitation change that indicate overall drying across the IPWP during the LGM. Based on a comparison of paleoclimatic records with modeling results, we propose that extra-tropical factors (ice-sheet size) controlled precipitation variability in the IPWP during the LGM through a combination of zonal shifts of ENSO and meridional migration of the ITCZ. Strong aridity during the LGM prevented formation of a subsurface barrier layer and, hence, allowed accessing of sufficient nutrients to surface waters, stimulating blooms of E. rex and subsequent formation of LDMs in the IPWP. These findings suggest an important role for high-latitude climate in the tropical hydrological cycle during the LGM.","Tropical West Pacific,Diatom blooms,Sea-surface salinity,Model simulation,Tropical hydroclimate,High-latitude forcing,"
"volcanic and tectonic features of shirahama bank in the northern ryukyu arc: implications for cross-arc volcanism controlled by arc-parallel extension","2021","This paper presents volcanic and tectonic features of Shirahama Bank, an unexplored shallow submarine edifice in the northern Ryukyu Arc which was previously poorly mapped, and consequently the nature of its volcanism and tectonism have been poorly understood. New high-resolution (5 m) bathymetry revealed that Shirahama Bank has small volcanic edifices and depressions on its flat top with water depths of 60–150 m. The edifices have pointy summits with steep slopes greater than 30°. Within the depressions, a total of 59 acoustic bubble plumes were detected by shipboard multibeam sonar, suggesting that active volcanic degassing occurs in this region. The bank is dissected entirely by NW–SE to WNW–ESE trending lineaments while the volcanic edifices and depressions on the flat top are undissected. Shirahama Bank was formed by multiple-stages of volcanism. The youngest volcanic stage probably occurred after surface erosion by sea-level low-stand during the late Pleistocene and after tectonic deformation, providing a constraint on the timing of Quaternary volcanism in the northern Ryukyu Arc. Structural control of arc volcanism in the area is observed. The NW–SE to WNW–ESE lineaments identified on and around Shirahama Bank are interpreted as normal faults and form cross-arc graben structures. The young volcanic structures and active bubble plumes at Shirahama Bank and surrounding areas are concentrated within these cross-arc grabens, suggesting that the most recent volcanism is controlled by ~NE–SW extension (arc-parallel or along-arc extension) in the northern Ryukyu Arc. Our results, combined with previous studies, suggest that arc-parallel extension, which differs from the previously known back-arc extension in the Okinawa Trough, plays an important role in arc volcanism during its initial stages.","Ryukyu Arc,Bubble plume,Arc-parallel extension,Cross-arc volcanism,"
"trade-off between latency and energy for offloading tasks in maritime internet of things","2022","With the advancement of maritime activities, the number of Maritime Internet-of-Things (M-IoT) devices is growing exponentially. However, due to the limited computational capacity of the M-IoT devices and the complex maritime network environment, the edge and central cloud computing scenarios can be adopted. Existing works have neither considered interference between the communication of ships nor the trade-off scenario between latency and energy consumption. In this paper, we have provided an optimization framework, namely VESBELT, which enable a trade-off between the minimization of service latency and energy consumption for offloading tasks on the edge or central cloud servers. Our experimental results depict that the developed system VESBELT is superior to contemporary works in terms of service latency and energy usage.","Mobile Edge Computing (MEC),computer network security,contemporary works,offloading tasks,Internet of Things,Energy consumption,Maritime Internet-of-Things,trade-off scenario,optimization framework,complex maritime network environment,Energy Consumption,ships,Servers,computational capacity,cloud computing,Task Offloading,Service Latency,central cloud computing scenarios,energy consumption,Minimization,Cloud computing,Interference,Internet,energy usage,maritime activities,NP-hard problem,M-IoT devices,"
"understanding global spatio-temporal trends and the relationship between vegetation greenness and climate factors by land cover during 1982–2014","2020","Analysis of the correlation between vegetation greenness and climate variable trends is important in the study of vegetation greenness. Our study used Normalized Difference Vegetation Index-3rd generation data from the Advanced Very High-Resolution Radiometer - Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies (AVHRR-GIMMS NDVI3g), land cover data from the Climate Change Initiative (CCI-LC), and climate data from the Climatic Research Unit global time series (CRU TS) of climate variables (temperature and precipitation, solar radiation) over the past 33 years. First, we estimated the overall trends for vegetation greenness and climate variables over five time periods. Second, we subjected the data to correlation, regression, and residual analyses to detect correlations between vegetation greenness and different climate variables. Third, we extracted trends and correlation results by primary land cover types for each climate zone. Our study was focused at the global scale, and findings indicate that the largest decreasing trend of vegetation greenness and grasslands occurred in the mid-latitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere and in parts of South America, Africa, Saudi Arabia, and south and northeast Asia. In particular, the cold climatic zones of forest (36.6%), cropland (36.6%), and grassland (14.1%) suffered significant decline in vegetation greenness. Anthropogenic activities are mainly responsible for declining vegetation greenness particularly in northern Africa, central and western Asia. However, residual analysis shows an increase in vegetation greenness in some parts of western Europe, southern Australia, and the northern part of South America. The study also identified temperature and precipitation as the main factors responsible for controlling vegetation growth. Hot-spot areas with the largest temperature increases were found in the Amazon, Central America, southern Greenland, east Africa, south-east Asia, and other areas. However, temperatures decreased in the western part of South America, Angola, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Papua New Guinea. Precipitation decreased the most from March to May over most parts of the world with high correlation (r = 0.88) in Russia Canada, northeast Asia, and central Africa. In general, climate factors were the principal drivers of the variation in vegetation greenness globally in recent years.","Vegetation greenness trends,Land cover,Correlation,Precipitation,Global,Temperature,"
"vessel sailing route extraction and analysis from satellite-based ais data using density clustering and probability algorithms","2023","The vessel Automatic Identification System (AIS) data collected by satellites have the features of large coverage area and large data volume, and they are instantaneous discrete data rather than time-continuous data, so the data has large dispersion with many noise points. This poses a challenge for vessel sailing route extraction. This paper proposes a vessel sailing route extraction method which consists of the fast Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm and the Kernel Density Estimation-based Outlier Factor (KDE-based OF) noise reduction algorithm. The method in this paper firstly improves the clustering discrimination method in the DBSCAN algorithm to separate trajectories in different directions. Secondly, this paper extracts a fast clustering algorithm based on the density clustering algorithm to reduce its computing time overhead with satellite big data. Finally, this paper proposes the KDE-based OF processing algorithm, which calculates the outlier probability distribution value of the trajectory points through the algorithm to eliminate the edge trajectory points with low probability distribution. Based on the actual satellite vessel AIS data, this paper conducts multi-method comparisons and performance analysis experiments. Experiments show that the proposed method has the best stability and advancement.","Vessel sailing route extraction,Kernel Density Estimation-based Outlier Factor (KDE-based OF),Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN),Automatic Identification System (AIS),"
"development and deployment of multi-mission intelligent autonomous maritime systems","2020","Cherokee Nation Strategic Programs (CNSP) and Ocean Aero, Inc. have teamed together to demonstrate the multi-mission capabilities of commercial autonomous maritime systems. CNSP has a proven record testing, fielding, and developing Unmanned Systems (UxS) programs across air, ground, and maritime domains. Ocean Aero has developed a portfolio of intelligent autonomous underwater and surface vehicles that are uniquely engineered for a wide range of applications above and below the ocean surface. The focus of our collaboration is the accelerated deployment of autonomous capabilities in operational mission scenarios. Unmanned systems are demonstrating daily value to commercial and civilian users today. Drones are rapidly moving beyond powerful remotely controlled information capture tools into advanced networks of aerial robots providing services and access that was never before considered valuable. Ground robot technologies are maturing just as rapidly and taking on many different forms as purpose-built systems are enabling subterranean exploration, driver safety on interstate highways, and disaster response support. Maritime systems are now fulfilling the same potential with robust, all-weather designs that enable long endurance, rugged missions for marine users. The operational value that these systems provide comes from the advancements in intelligent autonomy. We are currently testing the range of autonomous capabilities of the Ocean Aero Triton Series autonomous underwater and surface vehicle systems at the University of Southern Mississippi Marine Research Center (USM MRC). The Ocean Aero vehicles are designed and built with autonomous, persistent navigation capabilities as a standard feature. Additional customized, mission-centric sensors may be added to the systems to accomplish specific operational tasks and/or increase autonomous performance. The command-and-control (C2) communication architecture provides situational awareness and mission progress monitoring for the onboard vehicle decision-making, as well as the remote operator control station. To successfully achieve the high level of autonomous operations in locations without terrestrial communications (cellular) and beyond visual line of sight, UxS use satellite communications for navigation and mission data transfer. Our testing is evaluating the ability of the autonomous systems to accomplish multiple missions, including perimeter security, tracking of other surface vehicles, environmental monitoring, and marine science missions. These evaluations include the performance of the vehicles, the sensors, and the multi-domain communication systems, while characterizing the operating conditions for each test series. â€œAutonomyâ€ is a capability that means different things to different people. Our testing at the MRC is evaluating the ability of the system to react to new information, whether from external source or self-perceived, to accomplish the intended mission, such as detection of an unknown vehicle in the area. This ability to react includes concepts such as dynamic replanning for navigation, as well as communications with the operations center for mission management awareness. Through these communications and activities, we are measuring the operator workloads in multiple missions to determine if the autonomy in the system is increasing, decreasing, or improving operator performance. Our testing team was assembled specifically to accomplish these objectives. The full technical paper will include sample test cases and data collection examples for evaluating the Ocean Aero autonomous underwater and surface vehicle technologies using the Cherokee Nation Capabilities-Based Assessment process. This is the proven, repeatable process that we have used for evaluating air, ground, and maritime unmanned systems for many customers. We use this process for assessing the operational performance of mature products, not research-only test units. This focus on technologies that are commercially available or at least products from an active production line, allow us to evaluate capabilities as they relate to mission requirements and user objectives. We have the team with the experience, the equipment, the facilities, and the dedication to advance the expectations of what is possible for unmanned maritime systems. This paper covers the process for achieving that advancement, including identifying the challenges such as evaluating autonomous capabilities and operating in live environments.","research-only test units,Ocean Aero vehicles,Vehicle dynamics,operational value,autonomous navigation capabilities,mission progress monitoring,Cherokee Nation capabilities-based assessment process,UxS,remotely controlled information capture tools,Sensor systems,ocean surface,unmanned maritime systems,ground robot technologies,autonomy,terrestrial communications,maritime unmanned systems,onboard vehicle decision-making,command-and-control communication architecture,mission data transfer,satellite communication,multidomain communication systems,Testing,Vehicles,command-and-control,mission requirements,purpose-built systems,BVLOS,autonomous underwater vehicles,rugged missions,Sea surface,telecontrol,multimission intelligent autonomous maritime systems,testing team,data collection examples,CNSP,sensors,decision making,intelligent autonomy,persistent navigation capabilities,situational awareness,surface vehicle technologies,command and control systems,visual line of sight,path planning,mission management awareness,satellite communications,unmanned surface vehicles,mobile robots,sample test cases,test and evaluation,unmanned systems,UXS,Visualization,customized mission-centric sensors,maritime domains,Tools,surface vehicles,operational mission scenarios,surface vehicle systems,remote operator control station,University of Southern Mississippi Marine Research Center,Cherokee Nation Strategic Programs,intelligent autonomous underwater vehicles,"
"cyber insurance in the maritime transportation system","2023","The current cyber insurance model is poorly suited for and does not aid the cyber resilience of the maritime transport system. Traditional maritime insurance increasingly exempts cyber claims from policies making cyber insurance a necessity for protecting against cyber risk. With an ever-growing number of cyber events in the maritime transportation system, effective cyber insurance is a necessary investment. Our paper attempts to address this disconnect by analyzing the current cyber insurance marketplace in the maritime transportation system and identifying challenges and opportunities that aim to increase resilience.","Insurance,Economics,Transportation,insurance,Limiting,cybersecurity,resilience,Security,Industries,Maritime transportation system,Government,"
"a cloud based architecture capable of perceiving and predicting multiple vessel behaviour","2015","Progressively huge amounts of data, tracking vessels during their voyages across the seas, are becoming available, mostly due to the automatic identification system (AIS) that vessels of specific categories are required to carry. These datasets provide detailed insights into the patterns vessels follow, while safely navigating across the globe, under various conditions. In this paper, we develop an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) capable of predicting a vessels future behaviour (position, speed and course), based on events that occur in a predictable pattern, across large map areas. The main concept of this study is to determine if an ANN is capable of inferring the unique behavioural patterns that each vessel follows and successively use this as a means for predicting multiple vessel behaviour into a future point in time. We design, train and implement a proof of concept ANN, as a cloud based web application, with the ability of overlaying predicted short and long term vessel behaviour on an interactive map. Our proposed approach could potentially assist in busy port scheduling, vessel route planning, anomaly detection and increasing overall Maritime Domain Awareness.","Vessel behaviour prediction,Soft computing applications,Artificial Neural Network,Automated identification system,Maritime Domain Awareness,"
"remote sensing annual dynamics of rapid permafrost thaw disturbances with landtrendr","2022","Permafrost is warming globally which leads to widespread permafrost thaw. Particularly ice-rich permafrost is vulnerable to rapid thaw and erosion, impacting whole landscapes and ecosystems. Retrogressive thaw slumps (RTS) are abrupt permafrost disturbances that expand by several meters each year and lead to an increased soil organic carbon release. Local Remote Sensing studies identified increasing RTS activity in the last two decades by increasing number of RTS or heightened RTS growth rates. However, a large-scale assessment across diverse permafrost regions and at high temporal resolution allowing to further determine RTS thaw dynamics and its main drivers is still lacking. In this study we apply the disturbance detection algorithm LandTrendr for automated large-scale RTS mapping and high temporal thaw dynamic assessment to North Siberia (8.1×106km2). We adapted and parametrised the temporal segmentation algorithm for abrupt disturbance detection to incorporate Landsat+Sentinel-2 mosaics, conducted spectral filtering, spatial masking and filtering, and a binary machine-learning object classification of the disturbance output to separate between RTS and false positives (F1 score: 0.609). Ground truth data for calibration and validation of the workflow was collected from 9 known RTS cluster sites using very high-resolution RapidEye and PlanetScope imagery. Our study presents the first automated detection and assessment of RTS and their temporal dynamics at large-scale for 2001–2019. We identified 50,895 RTS and a steady increase in RTS-affected area from 2001 to 2019 across North Siberia, with a more abrupt increase from 2016 onward. Overall the RTS-affected area increased by 331% compared to 2000 (2000: 20,158ha, 2001–2019: 66,699ha). Contrary to this, 5 focus sites show spatio-temporal variability in their annual RTS dynamics, with alternating periods of increased and decreased RTS development, indicating a close relationship to thaw drivers. The majority of identified RTS was active from 2000 onward and only a small proportion initiated during the assessment period, indicating that the increase in RTS-affected area was mainly caused by enlarging existing RTS and not by new RTS. The detected increase in RTS dynamics suggests advancing permafrost thaw and underlines the importance of assessing abrupt permafrost disturbances with high spatial and temporal resolution at large-scales. Obtaining such consistent disturbance products will help to parametrise regional and global climate change models.","Landsat,Sentinel-2,Time series,Permafrost thaw,Multi-spectral analysis,Thermo-erosion,Retrogressive thaw slumps,"

"security in iot-enabled digital twins of maritime transportation systems","2023","The purposes are to explore the safety performance of the Maritime Transportation System (MTS) based on Digital Twins (DTs) Internet of Things (IoT) and develop maritime transportation towards intelligence and digitalization. Because the comprehensive operational security of modern MTS is not yet mature, historical transportation data of the Maritime Silk Road are acquired and preprocessed. Afterward, DTs are introduced, and relay nodes are added to data transmission paths to construct a maritime transportation DTs model based on relay cooperation IoT. Eventually, this modelâ€™s security performance is validated through simulation experiments. Relay security analysis suggests that interference information is a vital guarantee to assist in information non-disclosure, from which the constructed model can harvest energy to increase the data transmission power, thereby improving communication performance and secrecy rate. Outage probability analysis reveals that the simulated and the theoretical results are almost the same; moreover, given the systemâ€™s multi-hop paths in the same environment, the more the relays and the greater the fading index, the better the system performance and the lower the outage probability. Once the iterations reach a particular number, the node secrecy rate becomes optimal and cannot cause excessive burden to the system; besides, the power distribution can establish a new equilibrium when the nodes are in different locations, so that system security performance gets improved. The simulated value is closest to the actual result under 100% successful transmission probability and  $0.01\sim 0.05~\lambda $  value. To sum up, the constructed maritime transportation DTs model presents extraordinary transmission and security performance, providing an experimental basis for intelligent and secure maritime transportation in the future.","telecommunication network reliability,telecommunication security,telecommunication power management,Maritime Transportation System,Transportation,secure maritime transportation,historical transportation data,maritime transportation systems,Internet of Things,intelligent maritime transportation,Marine vehicles,maritime transportation DTs model,data transmission paths,relay nodes,IoT-enabled digital twins,Radio frequency,Maritime Silk Road,digital twins,comprehensive operational security,outage probability analysis,Relays,digitalization,relay cooperation IoT,node secrecy rate,communication performance,wireless channels,safety performance,relay security analysis,system performance,system security performance,cooperative communication,probability,Digital Twins Internet,data transmission power,Sensors,relay cooperation,Digital twins,Security,maritime transportation system,maritime silk road,"

"3-d multiobjective deployment of an industrial wireless sensor network for maritime applications utilizing a distributed parallel algorithm","2018","Effectively monitoring maritime environments has become a vital problem in maritime applications. Traditional methods are not only expensive and time consuming but also restricted in both time and space. More recently, the concept of an industrial wireless sensor network (IWSN) has become a promising alternative for monitoring next-generation intelligent maritime grids, because IWSNs are cost-effective and easy to deploy. This paper focuses on solving the issue of 3-D IWSN deployment in a 3-D engine room space of a very large crude-oil carrier and also considers numerous power facilities. To address this 3-D IWSN deployment problem for maritime applications, a 3-D uncertain coverage model is proposed that uses a modified 3-D sensing model and an uncertain fusion operator. The deployment problem is converted into a multiobjective optimization problem that simultaneously addresses three objectives: coverage, lifetime, and reliability. Our goal is to achieve extensive coverage, long network lifetime, and high reliability. We also propose a distributed parallel cooperative coevolutionary multiobjective large-scale evolutionary algorithm for maritime applications. We verify the effectiveness of this algorithm through experiments by comparing it with five state-of-the-art algorithms.

The proposed method is based on the representation of a ship's velocity with an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process and on the detection of changes of its long-run mean to identify navigational way-points. In order to assess the graph representativeness of the traffic, two performance metrics are introduced, leading to distinct graph construction criteria.

"tightly coupled, graph-based dvl/imu fusion and decoupled mapping for slam-centric maritime infrastructure inspection","2023","In this article, we address the problem of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM)-centric maritime infrastructure inspection [using unmanned surface vehicles (USVs)] via novel approaches in tightly-coupled, graph-based DVL/IMU fusion and decoupled mapping. As our first contribution, we formalize the preintegration of linear velocity measurements, obtained by a Doppler velocity log (DVL), in combination with angular velocity measurements, obtained by an inertial measurement unit (IMU), as binary factors encoding relative position. To evaluate state estimation improvements imparted by DVL/IMU fusion, we implement our proposed factor within a state-of-the-art, graph-based lidar-visual-inertial (LVI) SLAM system as our second contribution. Accuracy and robustness improvements are demonstrated in simulation by comparing maximum a posteriori pose estimates with and without DVL/IMU fusion against ground truth poses. As our third contribution, we propose a map generation framework for downstream inspection applications decoupled from SLAM. In our framework, volumetric data (captured by sonar, lidar, etc.) is transformed into a common world coordinate frame using extrinsic calibrations and SLAM pose estimates as input. Our framework operates over the complete set of raw volumetric data, whereas SLAM systems (both online and offline) typically operate over a subset of down-sampled volumetric data. To address the processing of additional volumetric data, we present innovations in refined pose correction and staged filtering for user-controlled denoising. We experimentally evaluate our map generation framework against the LVI SLAM system adopted for this study using real-world data and demonstrate improvements to map quality metrics important to inspection.","decoupled mapping,sensor fusion,Inspection,robot vision,unmanned surface vehicles (USVs),SLAM (robots),LVI SLAM system,Sea measurements,Laser radar,Doppler velocity log,SLAM systems,inspection,pose estimation,Simultaneous localization and mapping,angular velocity measurements,inertial measurement unit,graph-based lidar-visual-inertial SLAM system,state estimation,map generation framework,SLAM-centric maritime infrastructure inspection,mapping,Sonar,optical radar,Robustness,map quality metrics,state estimation improvements,unmanned surface vehicles,calibration,Velocity measurement,mobile robots,downstream inspection applications,linear velocity measurements,simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM),velocity measurement,"
"retrieving the stand age from a retrospective detection of multinannual forest changes using landsat data. application on the heavily managed maritime pine forest in southwestern france from a 30-year landsat time-series (1984â€“2014)","2015","The availability of Landsat data (Landsat 4, 5, 7 and 8) from ~30 years makes it possible to analyze the forest long term dynamics at high resolution (30m). The performances of the Landsat time-series have been already demonstrated for mapping and monitoring the annual clear-cuts and the storm damage in the Landes Forest, that covers ~1 million ha in southwestern France and that is heavily managed with even-aged stands with rather short rotations after clear-cut harvesting. Our objectives aimed at improving, automating, and enriching these previous methods. This was to operationally produce over the whole Landes Forest not only (1) the annual maps of clear-cutting from 1984 up the current year but also (2) the map of the current age that was derived from the forest change detected every year since 1984. The developed methodology used the time-series of surface reflectance and cloud mask provided for Landsat by USGS and sought to cope the possible absence of cloud-free image during the interest season or the numerous missing data in Landsat 7 images after 2002.

"using nfts and blockchain for traceability and auctioning of shipping containers and cargo in maritime industry","2022","The maritime industry is a complex multi-tiered sector that plays a major role in international shipping and trade. Seaborne transportation is responsible for 90% of goods moved globally, and containerized shipments account for more than 50% of those goods. This volume of movement requires efficient tracking and traceability methods that secure the documentation process and ensure the involved stakeholders. However, due to its complexity, the maritime industry suffers from a lack of trust, lack of ownership evidence, protracted documentation procedures, and excessive data aggregation. These shortcomings are reflected in delays and elevated costs in the shipping process. To mitigate these problems, we propose in this paper a blockchain-based solution for the ownership history and traceability of shipping containers in the industry. Our solution utilizes smart contracts and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Ethereum blockchain to accelerate the inefficient shipping process by digitizing ownership transfer and process documentation. Furthermore, the proposed system allows the owners to auction off their cargo in the destination ports, freeing warehouses and containers in the process. We analyze our proposed system in terms of transaction costs and smart contract security. The smart contracts are developed using the Solidity language in the Remix IDE and the code is made publicly available on GitHub.","Seaports,Blockchains,NFTs,auctioning,Blockchain,Ethereum,Costs,Smart contracts,supply chain,maritime shipping,Documentation,Containers,shipping containers,Decentralized applications,Supply chains,"
"assessment of offshore oil/gas platform status in the northern gulf of mexico using multi-source satellite time-series images","2018","Accurate knowledge of the detailed status (location and lifetime) of each oil/gas platform is crucial for ocean management and for understanding its potential environmental impact. However, this requirement is often compromised due to incomplete data records, especially when platform abandonment is not properly planned, designed, and/or executed. The availability of multi-source optical and SAR images provides the possibility of a systematic assessment, but the ubiquitous false positives and frequent geocoding errors make it technically challenging. Here, we develop a time-series remote sensing approach (TSRS) for detecting offshore platforms and determining their status, where the technical challenges are overcome using two strategies, as follows: (i) A stepwise optimization strategy applied to individual images and time-series images to mitigate numerous noises, to select platforms from candidates, and to assess platform status; and (ii) A cross geo-correction strategy using platforms derived from high-geometric accuracy images as ground control points to rectify poorly geo-referenced images. We applied the TSRS approach to the northern Gulf of Mexico using about 26,000 moderate-resolution optical/SAR images from eight satellites spanning the period from 1982 to 2017. TSRS detected a total of 9260 (5556) platforms in both Federal and State waters, including 3140 (1803) existing platforms, 5044 (3426) removed platforms, and 1076 (327) status-to-be-determined platforms where the numbers in parentheses represent those from Federal waters. Of these TSRS platforms, 4751 coincide spatially with 5476 (77.68%) of platform records of the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) platform database; 2846 (387 in Federal waters) are not found in the BSEE platform database but are convincingly supported by data from other sources (including BSEE-pipeline-database, time-series VIIRS nighttime light products, and littoral ground-truth images), meaning that 82.04% of the TSRS-derived platforms can be directly/indirectly confirmed. A site-specific validation in East Bay using multi-temporal ground-truth aerial images indicates that, for this site, the false negative rate (FNR) is ~9.63% and the false positive rate (FPR) is only 4.44%. The detailed beginning/end dates of the TSRS platforms are mostly confirmed by the corresponding Installation/Site-clear dates recorded in the BSEE platform database. Our findings suggest that the TSRS approach is a robust and cost-effective way to assess oil/gas platform status in large regions, and our results here may complement the official database, narrow down locations for future field investigations, and provide critical information for future assessment of the potential impacts of active and decommissioned platforms on the marine environments.","Landsat,Northern Gulf of Mexico,Offshore platform,Platform status assessment,Remote sensing,SAR,Time-series,"

In the logistics R&D community, the PI is already inspiring new designs of loading and packaging material, architectures for collaboration, and open information exchange, as well as algorithms for system-wide optimization. Our focus is on the position and role of maritime ports within the PI, as the transport hubs that facilitate most of the world's international trade. We introduce the key notions of the PI vision and expand on the unique position of maritime ports in the PI with the respective challenges this may create. Finally, we discuss the requirements for maritime ports to be ready to take up their role in the PI.

"machine learning-assisted anomaly detection in maritime navigation using ais data","2020","The automatic identification system (AIS) reports vessels' static and dynamic information, which are essential for maritime traffic situation awareness. However, AIS transponders can be switched off to hide suspicious activities, such as illegal fishing, or piracy. Therefore, this paper uses real world AIS data to analyze the possibility of successful detection of various anomalies in the maritime domain. We propose a multi-class artificial neural network (ANN)-based anomaly detection framework to classify intentional and non-intentional AIS on-off switching anomalies. The multi-class anomaly framework captures AIS message dropouts due to various reasons, e.g., channel effects or intentional one for carrying illegal activities. We extract position, speed, course and timing information from real world AIS data, and use them to train a 2-class (normal and anomaly) and a 3-class (normal, power outage and anomaly) anomaly detection models. Our results show that the models achieve around 99.9% overall accuracy, and are able to classify a test sample in the order of microseconds.","security of data,maritime traffic situation awareness,multiclass anomaly framework,pattern classification,multiclass artificial neural network,AIS message dropouts,neural nets,illegal fishing,learning (artificial intelligence),illegal activities,ships,automatic identification system,marine engineering,machine learning-assisted anomaly detection,maritime navigation,AIS transponders,"

"assessing the state of marine biodiversity in the northeast atlantic","2022","The Northeast Atlantic, a highly productive maritime area, has been exposed to a wide range of direct human pressures, such as fishing, shipping, coastal development, pollution, and non-indigenous species (NIS) introductions, in addition to anthropogenically-driven global climate change. Nonetheless, this regional sea supports a high diversity of species and habitats, whose functioning provides a variety of ecosystem services, essential for human welfare. In 2017, OSPAR, the Northeast Atlantic Regional Seas Commission, delivered an assessment of marine biodiversity for the Northeast Atlantic. This assessment examined biodiversity indicators separately to identify changes in Northeast Atlantic biodiversity, but stopped short of determining the status of biodiversity for many species and habitats. Here, we expand on this work and for the first time, a semi-quantitative approach is applied to evaluate holistically the state of Northeast Atlantic marine biodiversity across marine food webs, from plankton to top predators, via fish, pelagic and benthic habitats, including xeno-biodiversity (i.e. NIS). Our analysis reveals widespread degradation in marine ecosystems and biodiversity, particularly for marine birds and coastal bottlenose dolphins, as well as for benthic habitats and fish in some regions. The poor biodiversity status of these ecosystem components is likely the result of cumulative effects of human activities, such as habitat destruction or disturbance, overexploitation, eutrophication, the introduction of NIS, and climate change. Bright spots are also revealed, such as recent signs of recovery in some fish and marine bird communities and recovery in harbour and grey seal populations and the condition of coastal benthic communities in some regions. The status of many indicators across all ecosystem components, but particularly for the novel pelagic habitats, food webs and NIS indicators, however, remains uncertain due to gaps in data, unclear pressure-state relationships, and the non-linear influence of some pressures on biodiversity indicators. Improving monitoring and data access and increasing understanding of pressure-state relationships, including those that are non-linear, is therefore a priority for enabling future assessments, as is consistent and stable resourcing for expert involvement.","Ecosystem approach,Indicators,Marine Strategy Framework Directive,Holistic assessment,Anthropogenic pressures,Food webs,"
"seasonal dependence of rainfall extremes in and around jakarta, indonesia","2019","This study investigates the interannual, seasonal, and intraseasonal variation in rainfall extremes (REs) in Jakarta and surroundings. We used datasets of daily rainfall at three sites at coastal, inland and mountainous environments during 1974–2016 (42 years), Sea Surface Temperature, 850-hPa zonal and meridional winds, and Outgoing Longwave Radiation during 1979–2016 (37 years). The results show that intensity and frequency of REs, and their relative contribution to the total rainfall, have strong relationships with the Indian Ocean Dipole and El Niño Southern Oscillation in the dry season (Jun–Nov) but weak relationships in the wet season (Dec–May) at all sites. During active Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) period, the daily average rainfall and the number of RE days relative to all days show strong variation between MJO phases at all sites and the MJO signature differs between the three stations. At the coastal and inland sites, there is a less marked variation of the number of RE events relative to all days with MJO phases. Compared to lower altitudes, the high-altitude station has a greater number of RE events relative to all days in the wet season and a lower intensity of REs relative to total rainfall amount in the dry season. The results of the study suggest that the REs vary in each station due to highly localised differences in responses to large-scale conditions.","IOD,Seasonal dependence,ENSO,MJO,Rainfall extremes,"
"cognitively-inspired motion pattern learning & analysis algorithms for higher-level fusion and automated scene understanding","2007","We have developed a suite of neurobiologically inspired algorithms for exploiting track data to learn normal patterns of motion behavior, detect deviations from normalcy, and predict future behavior. These capabilities contribute to higher-level fusion situational awareness and assessment objectives. They also provide essential elements for automated scene understanding to shift operator focus from sensor monitoring and activity detection to assessment and response. Our learning algorithms learn behavioral patterns at a variety of conceptual, spatial, and temporal levels to reduce a massive amount of track data to a rich set of information regarding their field of regard that supports decision-making and timely response initiation. Continuous incremental learning enables the models of normal behavior to adapt well to evolving situations while maintaining high levels of performance. Deviations from normalcy result in reports being published directly to operator displays or to other reasoning components within a larger system. Deviation tolerance levels are user settable during system operation to tune alerting sensitivity. Operator (or other system component) responses to anomaly alerts can be fed back into the algorithms to further enhance and refine learned models. These algorithms have been successfully demonstrated to learn vessel behaviors across the maritime domain and to learn vehicle and dismount behavior in land-based settings.","Motion detection,Pattern analysis,Decision making,Algorithm design and analysis,Layout,Motion analysis,Computerized monitoring,Displays,Vehicles,Tracking,"
"summer bloom of vulcanodinium rugosum in cienfuegos bay (cuba) associated to dermatitis in swimmers","2021","The marine dinoflagellate Vulcanodinium rugosum produces powerful paralyzing and cytotoxic compounds named pinnatoxins (PnTX) and portimines. Even though, no related human intoxication episodes following direct exposure in seawater or the ingestion of contaminated seafood have been documented so far. This study aimed at investigating a dinoflagellate bloom linked to acute dermatitis cases in two recreational beaches in Cienfuegos Bay, Cuba. We used epidemiological and clinical data from 60 dermatitis cases consisting of individuals in close contact with the bloom. Seawater physical-chemical properties were described, and the microorganism causing the bloom was identified by means of light and scanning electron microscopy. Morphological identification was confirmed genetically by sequencing the internal transcribed spacers ITS1 and ITS2, and the 5.8S rDNA region. Toxic compounds were identified from a bloom extract using liquid chromatography (LC) coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS), and their concentrations were estimated based on low-resolution tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Sixty people who had prolonged contact with the dinoflagellate bloom suffered acute dermal irritation. Most patients (79.2%) were children and had to be treated with antibiotics; some required >5-day hospitalization. Combined morphological and genetic characters indicated V. rugosum as the causative agent of the bloom. rDNA sequences of the V. rugosum genotype found in the bloom aligned with others from Asia, including material found in the ballast tank of a ship in Florida. The predominant toxins in the bloom were portimine, PnTX-F and PnTX-E, similar to strains originating from the Pacific Ocean. This bloom was associated with unusual weather conditions such as frequent and prolonged droughts. Our findings indicate a close link between the V. rugosum bloom and a dermatitis outbreak among swimmers in Cienfuegos Bay. Phylogenetic evidence suggests a recent introduction of V. rugosum from the Pacific Ocean into Caribbean waters, possibly via ballast water.","Microbial biogeography,Harmful algal bloom,Human health,Emergent toxin,Toxic dinoflagellate,Skin irritation,"
"hybrid bernoulli filtering for detection and tracking of anomalous path deviations","2018","This paper presents a solution to the problem of sequential joint anomaly detection and tracking of a target subject to switching unknown path deviations. Based on a dynamic model described by Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) stochastic processes, the anomaly is represented by a target (e.g., a marine vessel) that deviates from a preset route by changing its nominal mean velocity. The Random Finite Set (RFS) framework is used to represent the switching nature of target's anomalous behavior in the presence of spurious measurements and detection uncertainty. Combining these two ingredients, the problem of jointly detecting target's path deviations and estimating its kinematic state can be formulated within the Bayesian framework, and analytically solved by means of a hybrid Bernoulli filter that sequentially updates the joint posterior density of the unknown OU velocity input (a Bernoulli RFS) and of the target's state random vector. We illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed filter, implemented in Gaussian-mixture form, in a simulated scenario of vessel tracking for maritime traffic monitoring.","Anomaly detection,switching nature,state random vector,Sea measurements,Stochastic processes,Radio frequency,vessel tracking,hybrid Bernoulli filtering,target tracking,Random Finite Set framework,stochastic processes,filtering theory,hybrid Bernoulli filter,Target tracking,object detection,Gaussian processes,Bayesian framework,Artificial intelligence,anomalous path deviations,unknown OU velocity input,nominal mean velocity,Surveillance,marine vessel,joint posterior density,sequential joint anomaly detection,"

"rapid precipitation changes in the tropical west pacific linked to north atlantic climate forcing during the last deglaciation","2018","The cause of rapid hydrological changes in the tropical West Pacific during the last deglaciation remains controversial. In order to test whether these changes were triggered by abrupt climate change events in the North Atlantic Ocean, variations in precipitation during the last deglaciation (18–10 ka) were extracted from proxy records of chemical weathering and terrigenous input in the western Philippine Sea (WPS). The evolution of chemical weathering and terrigenous input since 27 ka was reconstructed using the chemical index of alteration (CIA), elemental ratios (K/Al, TOC/TN and Ti/Ca), δ13Corg, terrigenous fraction abundance and flux data from International Marine Global Change Study Program (IMAGES) core MD06-3054 collected on the upper continental slope of eastern Luzon (northern Philippines). Sediment deposited during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) shows weathering equal to or slightly greater than Holocene sediment in the WPS. This unusual state of chemical weathering, which is inconsistent with lower air temperatures and decreased precipitation in Luzon during the LGM, may be due to reworking of poorly consolidated sediments on the eastern Luzon continental shelf during the LGM sea-level lowstand. Rapid changes in chemical weathering, characterized by higher intensity during the Heinrich event 1 (H1) and Younger Dryas (YD) and lower intensity during the Bølling-Allerød (B/A), were linked to rapid variations in precipitation in the WPS during the last deglaciation. The higher terrigenous inputs during the LGM relative to those of the Holocene were controlled by sea-level changes rather than precipitation. The terrigenous inputs show a long-term decline during the last deglaciation, punctuated by brief spikes during the H1 and YD related to sea-level rises and rapid precipitation changes in the WPS, respectively. The proxy records of chemical weathering and terrigenous input from eastern Luzon suggest high rainfall during the H1 and YD events, consistent with inferred rainfall patterns based on Fe/Ca records from offshore Mindanao. Rapid precipitation changes in the WPS did not coincide with migrations of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) but, rather, were related to state shifts of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) during the last deglaciation. Based on proxy records and modeling results, we argue that the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) controlled rapid precipitation changes in the tropical West Pacific through zonal shifts of ENSO or meridional migration of the ITCZ during the last deglaciation. Our findings highlight the dominant role of the North Atlantic Ocean in the tropical hydrologic cycle during the last deglaciation.","Chemical weathering,ENSO,Terrigenous input,AMOC,Western Philippine sea,ITCZ,"
"a decade of satellite observations reveal significant increase in atmospheric formaldehyde from shipping in indian ocean","2021","Atmospheric formaldehyde (HCHO) is a potential pollutant and very harmful to public health at higher doses. There are different sources for HCHO in the atmosphere, in which fuel combustion and biomass burning are predominant. The oxidation of hydroxyl radicals (OH) and methane are the chemical production pathways of HCHO in the troposphere. Here, we show a different source of HCHO emission to the atmosphere; the maritime shipping. The analyses using satellite measurements for the period 2005–2014 reveal large amounts of HCHO release along the ship routes in Indian Ocean, about 7–8 x1015 molec./cm2. This is nearly twice (150–200%) the ambient or background HCHO levels (about 4 × 1015 molec./cm2), when there is no ship emissions in the north Indian Ocean. The trend in HCHO concentrations over the Indian Ocean sea routes is about 0.008 × 1015 molec./cm2/year. The amount and the increasing trends of HCHO over the maritime routes in the north Indian Ocean are also comparable to those of the busiest sea-lanes in the world Oceans, such as the Panama Canal, Mediterranean Sea and Strait of Malacca. Our analyses, henceforth, suggest use of a better fuel for shipping to reduce the maritime pollution, as the polluted air can often be transported to the coastal regions and islands, which is a concern for public health in those regions.","HCHO,India,Atmospheric pollution,Indian ocean,Shipping emissions,"
"maritime anomaly detection based on mean-reverting stochastic processes applied to a real-world scenario","2018","A novel anomaly detection procedure is presented, based on the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) mean-reverting stochastic process. The considered anomaly is a vessel that deviates from a planned route, changing its nominal velocity. In order to hide this behavior, the vessel switches off its Automatic Identification System (AIS) device for a certain time, and then tries to revert to the previous nominal velocity. The decision that has to be taken is either declaring that a deviation happened or not, relying only upon two consecutive AIS contacts. A proper statistical hypothesis testing procedure that builds on the changes in the OU process long-term velocity parameter of the vessel is the core of the proposed approach and enables for the solution of the anomaly detection problem.","real-world data,Anomaly detection,Marine vehicles,mean-reverting stochastic process,security of data,maritime security,Stochastic processes,proper statistical hypothesis testing procedure,target tracking,statistical analysis,Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process,OU process long-term velocity parameter,automatic identification system,automatic identification system device,stochastic processes,marine engineering,AIS,nominal velocity,Artificial intelligence,maritime anomaly detection,vessel switches,Trajectory,statistical hypothesis test,Ornstein-Uhlenbeck,Transponders,planned route,Navigation,"
"drought-triggered western spruce budworm outbreaks in the interior pacific northwest: a multi-century dendrochronological record","2014","Douglas-fir forests in the interior Pacific Northwest are subject to sporadic outbreaks of the western spruce budworm, a species widely recognized as the most destructive defoliator in western North America. Outbreaks of the western spruce budworm often occur synchronously over broad regions and lead to widespread loss of leaf area and decrease in growth rates in affected stands. In spite of the ecological and economic significance of this defoliator, the mechanisms controlling this species’ population dynamics are still not fully understood. We used dendrochronological methods to reconstruct three centuries of western spruce budworm outbreaks at thirteen sites along a transect running from central Oregon to western Montana and compared the outbreak reconstructions with regional drought history. The reconstructions reveal repeated western spruce budworm outbreaks that sometimes persisted more than a decade and were significantly synchronous among sites. Synchrony was higher in the second half of the record, possibly due to changes in forest composition and structure brought about by land use practices. Across stands and regions, there was a moderately strong relationship between initiation of synchronous outbreaks and periods of transitional climate conditions in which moisture availability was below average prior to outbreak initiation, but above average in the first few years of an outbreak. There was a weak relationship between cessation of outbreaks and one or more years of high moisture availability. Outbreaks tended to occur near the end of droughts. The association between climatic variability and outbreak dynamics observed across this transect indicates that climate is an important driver of western spruce budworm outbreaks. Other factors that we did not test, but that may influence outbreak dynamics include stand structure, forest composition, predation, and phenological synchrony between larvae and host trees. Future changes in western spruce budworm outbreak dynamics will be determined by a combination of changing climate, interactions with other disturbance agents, and changing forest composition and structure. Our results suggest that western spruce budworm outbreaks will likely intensify if drought frequency increases in the future.","Dendrochronology,Pacific Northwest,Drought,Western spruce budworm,Defoliators,Insect outbreaks,"

Our framework first applies the Selective Search (SS) method on RGB image data to extract possible candidate proposals which likely contain the objects of interest. Then it uses the information from other sensors in order to reduce the number of generated proposals by SS and find more dense proposals. Finally, the class of objects within the final proposals are identified by Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Experimental results on real dataset demonstrate that our framework can precisely detect meaningful object regions using a smaller number of proposals than other object proposals methods. Further, our framework can achieve reliable object detection and classification results in maritime environments.","sensor fusion,marine radar,Cameras,Feature extraction,Laser radar,proposal generation,image colour analysis,deep neural networks,RGB cameras,radar,object detection,autonomous vehicles,Proposals,feature extraction,image classification,radar imaging,optical radar,convolutional neural nets,search problems,infrared imaging,maritime environment,infrared camera,object proposal methods,Microsoft Windows,RGB image data,multisensor proposal fusion,Object detection,Sensors,Convolutional Neural Network,Selective Search method,"
"learning for prediction of maritime collision avoidance behavior from ais network","2021","With the rapid increase in global maritime shipping, there is a great demand for the technology of maritime traffic monitoring to detect inappropriate encountering interaction between ships and prevent ship collision accidents. The Automatic Identification System (AIS) network makes it possible to collect a large volume of maritime traffic data and investigate the collision avoidance behavior of real-world ships. Most collision avoidance systems are based on expert systems and simulations based on the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGs). Those regulations outline the general principles underlying collision avoidance; however, they do not provide specific guidance and fail to account for the complexity of many real-world situations. Furthermore, guidance systems coordinating the movement of a ship must have the capacity to predict the movement behavior of all ships involved in potential encounter situations, and do so as early as possible for anti-collision reaction. Our objective in this study was to model the collision avoidance behaviors of human operators in order to formulate a set of realistic trajectory predictions for encountering near collision scenarios. By machine learning approach, the proposed framework is able to learn a model of interaction movement behavior from collected AIS historical traffic data involving near collision situations and then generate a set of predicted trajectories while ships encountering. The proposed model eliminates the need for a priori information related to environmental conditions and the rules governing encounter situations. The resulting projections can be used to suggest anti-collision paths for navigators or to guide the selection of collision-free paths for maritime autonomous surface ships.","maritime traffic monitoring,collision-free paths,Regulation,maritime traffic data,Automatic Identification System network,collision avoidance systems,maritime autonomous surface ships,Marine vehicles,Machine learning,control engineering computing,Predictive models,AIS network,ships,marine safety,global maritime shipping,anti-collision paths,International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea,machine learning,Sea surface,expert systems,marine engineering computing,interaction movement behavior,encounter situation,Trajectory,collision avoidance behavior,trajectory prediction,AIS historical traffic data collection,ship collision accidents,Navigation,navigation,COLREG,collision avoidance,marine control,learning (artificial intelligence),maritime collision avoidance behavior prediction,"
"demurrage pattern analysis using logical analysis of data: a case study of the ulsan port authority","2022","Maritime logistics, which accounts for around 80% of international trade around the world, has been a driving force for economic growth. Increases in maritime traffic, however, lead to increased congestion in berths and terminals. This congestion in turn negatively affects the total ship turnaround time and leads to decreased efficiency in port operations and a higher demurrage rate, which refers to the number of vessels in queue for more than a fixed time period waiting to load/unload out of the total number of vessels entering a port. The demurrage rate directly affects a port’s operating profits; thus, this rate needs to stay as low as possible. In this study, we focus on developing a methodology to address the demurrage rate of a port. To this end, we first collect two sets of vessel data (2016 annual data for training and 2019 annual data for validating) for ships entering and leaving the Port of Ulsan in the Republic of Korea and integrate these datasets with berth data and weather data. We tailor the logical analysis of data (LAD) technique to derive the patterns from the training data that mitigate or aggravate the demurrage rate. We use these patterns to predict the demurrage rate for the validating set of data. The overall binary classification results demonstrate the proposed LAD technique’s competitive performance, compared with other state-of-the-art machine learning methods. We then analyze the patterns to derive policy suggestions that can lower the demurrage rate at the Port of Ulsan. Our computational experiments find that the availability of tugs or pilots and port arrival times mainly affect the demurrage rate at the Port of Ulsan. Finally, our study showcases new possibilities for using patterns of demurrage and non-demurrage vessels obtained by LAD to help policymakers and port operators address the growing demurrage problem.","Maritime logistics,Maritime traffic data,Logical analysis of data,Port congestion,Demurrage rate,"
"on the effectiveness of ai-assisted anomaly detection methods in maritime navigation","2020","The automatic identification system (AIS) has become an essential tool for maritime security. Nevertheless, how to effectively use the static and dynamic voyage information of the AIS data in maritime traffic situation awareness is still a challenge. This paper presents a comparative study of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques on their effectiveness in dealing with various anomalies in maritime domain using the AIS data. The AIS on-off switching (OOS) anomaly is critical in maritime security, since AIS technology is susceptible to manipulation and it can be switched on and off to hide illegal activities. Thus, we try to detect and distinguish between intentional and non-intentional AIS OOS anomalies through our AI -assisted anomaly detection framework. We use AIS data, in particular positional and navigational status of vessels, to study the effectiveness of seven AI techniques, such as artificial neural network, support vector machine, logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, decision tree, random forest and naive Bayes, in detecting the AIS OOS anomalies. Our experimental results show that ANN and SVM are the most suitable techniques in detecting the AIS OOS anomalies with 99.9% accuracy. Interestingly, the ANN model outperforms others when trained with a balanced (i.e., same order of samples per class) dataset, and SVM, on the other hand, is suitable when training dataset is unbalanced.","maritime traffic situation awareness,AI-assisted anomaly detection,decision trees,Support vector machines,logistic regression,Anomaly detection,static voyage information,random forests,ANN,marine navigation,Feature extraction,security of data,maritime security,k-nearest neighbors,regression analysis,AIS technology,naive Bayes,neural nets,naive Bayes methods,automatic identification system,marine safety,marine engineering,support vector machines,maritime navigation,dynamic voyage information,maritime domain,random forest,SVM,Artificial intelligence,AIS on-off switching anomaly,nearest neighbour methods,artificial neural network,Training,Trajectory,support vector machine,nonintentional AIS OOS anomalies,Navigation,artificial intelligence,decision tree,AIS data,"
"emerging marine pollution from container ship accidents: risk characteristics, response strategies, and regulation advancements","2022","Container ship accidents can contaminate the surrounding marine environment and even have wider impact. Our study aims to provide a comprehensive review of emerging marine pollution from container ship accidents with the focus on risk characteristics, response strategies, and regulation advancements. It was found that the number of container ship accidents significantly increased in the past decade, and most accidents occurred in ports, harbors, piers, anchorages, berths, and open seas. The types of accidents were mainly collisions, groundings, and fires. The risk of marine pollution from container ship accidents is complex due to the variety of containerized cargo. The contamination derived from heavy metal, plastic fiber, leaked fuel, and hazardous and noxious substances after accidents can endanger entire marine habitats and be continuously accumulated through the food chain, eventually posing a threat to human health. The risks and pollution caused by container boxes are often overlooked. There is a basic response process, comprising data collection, decision-making, emergency response, monitoring, etc., for container ship accidents. There are currently deficiencies in management regulations for mitigating sunken container pollution. Improving operating procedures, establishing regional cooperation frameworks, developing contingency plans and protocols, and increasing public awareness can help deal with these pollution issues.","Regulation,Container ship accidents,Environmental risk,Marine pollution,Response,"
"phytoplankton community changes in a coastal upwelling system during the last century","2023","Phytoplankton communities in coastal upwelling systems are influenced by the interplay between human-induced and natural climate forcing that vary regionally and the two factors have not been well quantified. Combining lipid biomarker analyses in 23 sediment cores from the Zhejiang coast of the East China Sea and a physical-ecological model, we found that during the 1960s–2000s there was a 42 ± 4% increase in diatom proportions and a 17 ± 8% decrease in dinoflagellate proportions within the core upwelling area that is attributed to changes in Kuroshio Current transport and coastal upwelling. During the 1950s–2000s there was a 16 ± 8% increase in dinoflagellate proportions and 12 ± 4% decrease in diatom proportions outside the core upwelling area which is attributed to anthropogenic nutrient inputs and climate warming.

"toward a new maritime communication system in detroit of gibraltar where conventional and autonomous ships will co-exist","2017","In the next decades, hundreds of autonomous ships (AS) and Conventional ships (CS) will cross the Detroit of Gibraltar. For their autonomous operation, and remote control, these ships need to communicate with each other, with the vessel traffic system (VTS), with the port state control (PSC) and with the shore control centre (SCC). For a sustainable maritime industry, the biggest challenge will be the implementation of reliable and cost effective communication carrier to assure a continuous ships connectivity. Our contribution consists of quantifying and classifying the data to be transferred, the identification of ship mobility environment challenges, and the proposal of mobile WiMAX as a reliable, secure and cost effective maritime communication carrier.

"baseline air mass selection at cape point, south africa: application of 222rn and other filter criteria to co2","2004","Concentrations of 222Rn (March 1999–August 2002) from a recently installed analyser at the station Cape Point (34°S, 18°E), South Africa, were analysed statistically. The combination of 222Rn with information on wind direction and carbon monoxide (CO) permitted a classification of air masses into continental, marine, and mixtures of both. The ability to select trace gas data representing purely maritime conditions is shown through application to carbon dioxide (CO2) data. 222Rn levels at Cape Point ranged from near zero to above 5000mBqm−3. Monthly percentiles show practically no seasonal dependence for values up to the 25th percentile (P25), corresponding to 222Rn <100mBqm−3, which is considered typical for marine air. In contrast, 222Rn percentiles exceeding P50 reveal an austral winter maximum, related to a higher incidence of continental air at that time of the year. The wind sector pattern for 222Rn concentrations largely coincides with that observed for CO, but covers a wider sector to the east, reflecting continental source areas. Air masses with 222Rn levels between 100 and 250mBqm−3 were found to be still affected by terrestrial sources. Our routinely used percentile-based statistical filter applied to CO2 accepted <75% of the data compared to the radon criterion for maritime air (222Rn <100mBqm−3), which only yielded 18%, but is more stringent in excluding terrestrial influences. CO2 data filtered by using a combination of various selection parameters agreed well with data obtained for 222Rn <100mBqm−3, confirming that this 222Rn threshold is a suitable criterion for purely maritime data. Nonetheless, for CO2 the statistical filter, which does not depend on other species and has better data coverage, still retains its applicability for routine trace gas filtering with respect to baseline concentrations.","CO,Rn (radon),Background concentration,Data filtering,Air mass classification,"
"augmented reality for maritime navigation assistance - egocentric depth perception in large distance outdoor environments","2021","Augmented reality (AR) provides enormous potential to improve navigation assistance interfaces by displaying information directly into the user's field of view. In maritime contexts, such AR interfaces could supplement conventional solutions that require users to interpret spatial positions visualized on two-dimensional maps. In order to design useful navigation assistance, it is crucial to understand how egocentric distances of displayed objects are perceived and how different design attributes influence depth estimation. While previous research mainly focused on depth perception in indoor environments and rather short distances, this paper presents an investigation of the perceived egocentric distance of virtual objects in distances up to 75 meters in an open outdoor environment. In a perceptual matching task experiment using the Microsoft HoloLens 2, participants had to move objects with different (i) shape, (ii) coloration, and (iii) relation to floor to various target distances. Our results suggest that participants overestimated the distance to virtual objects across all tested distances since they significantly underproduced target distances for all investigated design factors. Based on these results, we explored potential design implications for a maritime AR navigation assistance on a ship in the local port area.","augmented reality,Microsoft HoloLens 2,navigation assistance interfaces,spatial positions,human computer interaction,open outdoor environment,ship,marine navigation,egocentric depth perception,indoor environments,design attributes,perceptual matching task experiment,ships,Performance evaluation,marine engineering,distance outdoor environments,Seaports,Shape,perceived egocentric distance,depth estimation,AR interfaces,Indoor environment,two-dimensional maps,maritime navigation assistance,local port area,displayed objects,target distances,Human-centered computing-Human computer interaction (HCI)-Interaction paradigms-Mixed/augmented reality,maritime AR navigation assistance,Visualization,Human-centered computing-Visualization-Empirical studies in visualization-,Navigation,Rendering (computer graphics),virtual objects,user field of view,"
"“ship-port-country” multi-dimensional research on the fine analysis of china's lng trade","2023","Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) is a clean and low-carbon energy source that plays an important role in combating global warming. As the world's largest greenhouse gas (GHG) emitter, China has taken coal-to-gas as an important measure to reduce GHG emissions, and has become the world's largest LNG importer. Studying the patterns and characteristics of China's LNG trade is of great significance for ensuring energy supply security, formulating and adjusting energy strategies. However, the refined analysis of China's LNG trade is still inadequate, mainly due to the lack of research on the details of ship trajectories and port attributes. Therefore, a “ship-port-country” multidimensional LNG trade analysis method is proposed to improve the timeliness, multi-dimensionality and fineness of China's LNG trade analysis. The multidimensional characteristics of China's LNG trade are analyzed by studying the big data of nearly 3.5 billion automatic identification system (AIS) records in 2017. The study has found that (1) The arrival frequency of China's LNG trading ships varies greatly with time. For example, the most frequent daily arrivals are between 04:00 and 05:00 in the morning, while the least frequent arrivals are between 15:00 and 17:00 in the afternoon. (2) The Chinese LNG trade network consisting of 79 ports has been formed, of which NANTONG Port is the most important port. (3) The LNG trade volume calculated in this study has shown a strong correlation with the national LNG trade statistics and can be used to analyze LNG trade with higher spatial and temporal resolution. According to the characteristics of LNG trade at the three levels of ship, port and country, China can optimize its LNG trade policy from the following aspects: (1) Dynamically allocate port resources according to the arrival frequency of LNG tankers to reduce port congestion and waste of resources. (2) Expand core LNG trading ports such as NANTONG Port, ZHOUSHAN Port, TANGSHAN (JINGTANG) Port, XIUYU Port, DALIAN Port and LUSHUN Port. (3) Actively realize the diversification of LNG trading partners to reduce the dependence of LNG import sources on one country or region, and ensure energy security. The “ship-port-country” multi-level LNG trade analysis method proposed in this study provides a new research perspective for the analysis of the LNG trade pattern. This study reveals the multidimensional characteristics of China's LNG trade, which can provide decision-making support for China to formulate reasonable LNG trade policies and energy security policies, and is conducive to the stable and sustainable development of global LNG trade.","Multidimensional analysis,Ship trajectory data,China's LNG trade,LNG trade,Fine-grained trade characteristics,"
"contextual multi-armed bandits for data caching in intermittently-connected lossy maritime networks","2023","Information centric networking (ICN) is a promising architecture for intermittently-connected lossy maritime networks. By decoupling content from location and storing popular content in caches ICNs enable content access even when content producers are disconnected from the network. However, network-resource constraints, node mobility, and low data rates remain as major challenges to achieve the potential benefits that increased data bring to maritime networks. In this work, we propose an ICN architecture that uses dedicated caches and off-path caching to deliver popular network content to consumers. Our architecture motivates a data-caching problem in which each cache must define effective and efficient caching policies, with effectiveness assessed based on the cache-hit ratio achieved by the cache and efficiency assessed based on the usage of the communications budget allocated for data caching purposes. This work develops an online caching algorithm that enables dedicated caches to sequentially decide what content to cache.

The surveillance area is partitioned by a square grid and the kinematic states that fall inside each cell of the grid are modelled by a Poisson point process.

"fuel consumption prediction for a passenger ferry using machine learning and in-service data: a comparative study","2023","As the importance of eco-friendly transportation increases, providing an efficient approach for marine vessel operation is essential. Methods for status monitoring with consideration to the weather condition and forecasting with the use of in-service data from ships requires accurate and complete models for predicting the energy efficiency of a ship. The models need to effectively process all the operational data in real-time. This paper presents models that can predict fuel consumption using in-service data collected from a passenger ship. Statistical and domain-knowledge methods were used to select the proper input variables for the models. These methods prevent over-fitting, missing data, and multicollinearity while providing practical applicability. Prediction models that were investigated include multiple linear regression (MLR), decision tree approach (DT), an artificial neural network (ANN), and ensemble methods. The best predictive performance was from a model developed using the XGboost technique which is a boosting ensemble approach.

"object segmentation from a dynamic background using a pixelwise rigidity criterion and application to maritime target recognition","2014","This paper describes a novel approach for rigid object segmentation from a dynamic background using a pre-recorded video with a moving camera, and we apply it to the problem of vessel segmentation in a maritime video scene. The difficulty of modeling background appearance or/and dynamic, modeling object appearance, and compensating camera motion renders this task very challenging. Therefore, the proposed method only uses a geometric constraint regarding target motion rigidity in order to achieve object segmentation in a full video segment. Such an idea is not new in object segmentation literature, but the novelty in this paper resides in that the target rigidity assumption is implemented at the pixel level, but not at the object scale. This is firstly achieved by deriving a theoretical optic flow model in the neighborhood of each pixel under the 3D rigid motion assumption of object, which is later compared against the observed 2D optic flow model in the neighborhood of a pixel in order to derive a pixelwise rigidity criterion. The latter is further reenforced along individual (pixel) trajectories in a video segment. Finally, a mere thresholding operation allows to quickly extract target from background in a full video segment.

"outlier detection approach for discovering anomalous maritime profiles","2023","Maritime authorities play a key role in ensuring the safety and security of shipping lanes and ports. The port state control mechanism enables these authorities to physically verify suspect vessels (e.g., involved in smuggling or piracy events), but choosing the most relevant vessels to be inspected represents a challenging task.

This paper presents a statistical analysis on the temporal durations of four types of naval statuses: sailing, docked in port, waiting at anchor and not transmitting AIS data. These durations were extracted from the historical activity of different classes of vessels that passed the Black Sea region (Romanian Exclusive Economic Zone) in 2022.

Seasonal variation in time of sunset is used to distinguish evasive behavior from daily routines on board. Using data from surveillance flights above the Dutch part of the North Sea during 1992–2011, we provide evidence for a sudden increase in illegal discharges after sunset across the year.

"combining high temporal resolution whale distribution and vessel tracking data improves estimates of ship strike risk","2020","When assessing harmful human-wildlife interactions, researchers often attempt to calculate the risk that an interaction will occur. However, these analyses often quantify risk based on temporally static or spatially coarse measures of species distributions and human activity. As a result, risk estimates often do not reflect the dynamic nature of animal movement and anthropogenic uses of the environment. To illustrate the impacts of various temporal resolutions of data, we present a case study of blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus) ship strike risk in the U.S. Southern California Bight by combining predicted daily whale distributions with continuous vessel movement data. This represents the first effort to characterize blue whale ship strike risk by including the most recent high-resolution estimates of eastern Pacific blue whale distribution. We used these data to compare the ship strike risk models at varying temporal resolutions to address the effect of using coarser resolution input data. Our results show that it is critical to account for both dynamic patterns of human activity and species occurrences when assessing the risk of human-wildlife conflict. Analysis based on higher resolutions of potential interactions show greater variability in risk. Coarser resolution data mask variability in risk that may result from patchy conditions of blue whale habitat and/or variations in vessel traffic. We also demonstrate that coarser temporal resolutions lead to overestimations of risk. For highly mobile species subject to human-wildlife interactions such as blue whales, long-term environmental solutions depend on matching ecological data to human activity data at the most appropriate scale.","Marine megafauna,Ship strike,Human-wildlife conflict,Migratory species,Dynamic ocean management,Anthropogenic risk,"

"an adaptive ionosphere clutter suppression and target detection method for hfswr maritime surveillance","2023","High-frequency surface wave radar (HFSWR) as a maritime surveillance facility faces the tough challenges. One of them is that various unwanted echo components constantly destroy the detection performance of HFSWR, especially the dynamically changing ionosphere clutter. This article proposes an adaptive ionosphere clutter suppression and target detection algorithm (AICSTD) based on improved higher order singular value decomposition (HOSVD) and deep learning network. First, we analyze the multiple-dimensional characteristics of different types of ionosphere clutter echo data. Then, refer to the multichannel HFSWR echo data structure, we apply simplified HOSVD and orthogonal subspace projection to eliminate the unwanted echo component and, meanwhile, preserve the target echo. The key parameter of simplified HOSVD is determined by the mean structural similarity (MSSIM) index, which contributes to reduce the computation complexity of the proposed method. Finally, we improved the deep learning network to detect the targets in various behaviors after the clutter suppression. In order to address the issue of limited clutter data, transfer learning based on historical radar echo data is applied. A thorough experimental analysis on various real clutter data shows that the proposed method performs competitively. Our method shows a superior performance over many state-of-the-art clutter suppression methods, with a covered target detection accuracy of 92.4% under strong spread clutter background.","Ionosphere,structural similarity (SSIM) index,higher order singular value decomposition (HOSVD),ionosphere clutter suppression,Tensors,Clutter,Deep learning,Object detection,Doppler effect,target detection,high-frequency surface wave radar (HFSWR),Reflection,"

Thermal demagnetization of the Maringouin Fm. isolated a characteristic remanence direction of D= 178.7Â°, I= 24.9Â°, Î±95= 14.5Â°, N= 9.High field anisotropy of isothermal remanence followed by alternating field and thermal cleaning on leached samples was used to isolate the fabric of hematite. Individual particle anisotropy was measured directly from magnetic separates using a new technique. Hematite's magnetic fabric and particle anisotropy were used to apply an inclination correction. Our inclination corrections indicate up to 10Â° of inclination shallowing, corresponding to corrected palaeopole positions of 27.2Â°N, 118.3Â°E, A95= 6.2Â° and 27.4Â°N, 117.2Â°E, A95= 13.1Â° for the Shepody and Maringouin formations, respectively. This correction corresponds to a âˆ¼ 6Â° increase in colatitude for Carboniferous North America, which translates into approximately a 650 km change in North America's palaeogeographic position. The proposed position of North America supports a Pangea B-type reconstruction.","Palaeomagnetism applied to Tectonics,Magnetic mineralogy and petrology,Palaeomagnetism applied to geologic processes,Magnetic fabrics and anisotropy,Rock and mineral magnetism,"
"associative learning of vessel motion patterns for maritime situation awareness","2006","Neurobiologically inspired algorithms have been developed to continuously learn behavioral patterns at a variety of conceptual, spatial, and temporal levels. In this paper, we outline our use of these algorithms for situation awareness in the maritime domain. Our algorithms take real-time tracking information and learn motion pattern models on-the-fly, enabling the models to adapt well to evolving situations while maintaining high levels of performance. The constantly refined models, resulting from concurrent incremental learning, are used to evaluate the behavior patterns of vessels based on their present motion states. At the event level, learning provides the capability to detect (and alert) upon anomalous behavior. At a higher (inter-event) level, learning enables predictions, over pre-defined time horizons, to be made about future vessel location. Predictions can also be used to alert on anomalous behavior. Learning is context-specific and occurs at multiple levels: for example, for individual vessels as well as classes of vessels.

"bidirectional data-driven trajectory prediction for intelligent maritime traffic","2023","Intelligent maritime transportation is one of the most promising enabling technologies for promoting trade efficiency and releasing the physical labor force. The trajectory prediction method is the foundation to guarantee collision avoidance and route optimization for ship transportation. This article proposes a bidirectional data-driven trajectory prediction method based on Automatic Identification System (AIS) spatio-temporal data to improve the accuracy of ship trajectory prediction and reduce the risk of accidents. Our study constructs an encoder-decoder network driven by a forward and reverse comprehensive historical trajectory and then fuses the characteristics of the sub-network to predict the ship trajectory. The AIS historical trajectory data of US West Coast ships are employed to investigate the feasibility of the proposed method. Compared with the current methods, the proposed approach lessens the prediction error by studying the comprehensive historical trajectory, and 60.28% has reduced the average prediction error. The ocean and port trajectory data are analyzed in maritime transportation before and after COVID-19. The prediction error in the port area is reduced by 95.17% than the data before the epidemic. Our work helps the prediction of maritime ship trajectory, provides valuable services for maritime safety, and performs detailed insights for the analysis of trade conditions in different sea areas before and after the epidemic.","epidemics,Transportation,Automatic Identification System spatio-temporal data,port trajectory data,Hidden Markov models,ship transportation,average prediction error,transportation,Marine vehicles,intelligent maritime transportation,comprehensive historical trajectory,Predictive models,bidirectional data-driven trajectory prediction method,West Coast ships,bidirectional data-driven,Maritime transportation,maritime ship trajectory,ships,marine safety,marine engineering,Data models,ship trajectory prediction,promising enabling technologies,Artificial intelligence,intelligent maritime traffic,physical labor force,Trajectory,trajectory prediction,route optimization,diseases,collision avoidance,automatic identification system (AIS) data,encoder-decoder network,maritime safety,AIS historical trajectory data,"
"anomaly detection and tracking based on meanâ€“reverting processes with unknown parameters","2019","Piecewise mean-reverting stochastic processes have been recently proposed and validated as an effective model for long-term object prediction. In this paper, we exploit the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) dynamic model to represent an anomaly as any deviation of the long-run mean velocity from the nominal condition. This amounts to modeling the anomaly as an unknown switching control input that can affect the dynamics of the object. Under this model, the problem of joint anomaly detection and tracking can be addressed within the Bayesian random set framework by means of a hybrid Bernoulli filter (HBF) that sequentially estimates a Bernoulli random set (empty under nominal behavior) for the unknown long-run mean velocity, and a random vector for the kinematic state of the object. An additional challenge is represented by the fact that two extra parameters, i.e. the reversion rate and the noise covariance of the underlying OU process, need to be specified for Bayes-optimal prediction. We propose a multiple-model adaptive filter (MMA-HBF) for anomaly detection, tracking and simultaneous estimation of the OU unknown parameters. The effectiveness of these tools is demonstrated on a simulated maritime scenario.","random finite sets,Kinematics,Bernoulli random set,Anomaly detection,anomaly detection,Bayes methods,Mathematical model,Switches,mean-reverting Ornstein-Uhlenbeck stochastic process,Stochastic processes,Radio frequency,OU unknown parameters,sequential estimation,piecewise mean-reverting stochastic processes,target tracking,stochastic processes,unknown long-run mean velocity,hybrid Bernoulli filter,random processes,simulated maritime scenario,nominal condition,long-term object prediction,Bayes-optimal prediction,noise covariance,anomaly tracking,Ornstein-Uhlenbeck dynamic model,underlying OU process,multiple-model approach,multiple-model adaptive filter,adaptive filters,unknown switching control input,random vector,"
"multiple episodes of fluid flow in the sw barents sea (loppa high) evidenced by gas flares, pockmarks and gas hydrate accumulation","2012","Gas and gas hydrates have gained considerable attention in the last 20yr due to their possible impact on global climate change from methane escalations. Our study area, the SW Barents Sea, is unique in its evolution due to the effect of glaciations which removed thick layers of sediment from the seabed. Unloading due to erosion and deglaciation resulted in opening of pre-existing faults and creation of new ones, facilitating fluid migration and eventually escape into the water from the subsurface. Expressions of hydrocarbon gas accumulation and fluid flow such as gas hydrates and pockmarks are widely distributed in the Barents Sea. Several gas flares, some of them 200m high in echograms, occur along a segment of the Ringvassøy Loppa Fault Complex, indicating open fractures and active fluid flow. Observation of gas flares along regional fault complexes outside pockmark regions indicates that present gas escape occurs along faults only. The pockmark formation and gas flares belong to different episodes of fluid flow. The pockmarks are absent outside soft sediment depocentres indicating that their existence is related to the presence of recording medium. The thin sediment cover in pockmarks and their penetration down into glaciomarine sediments indicate that they formed after deposition of these sediments and that fluid escape was active to the very recent past. Methane hydrate stability zone (MHSZ) modelling shows that after the last glacial maximum 18000–2000014Cyears ago, the MHSZ has thinned from 600m to zero in most parts of the SW Barents Sea. The fluid expulsion probably happened after retreat of the glaciers causing release of methane from dissociation of methane hydrates through fluid escape processes which lasted until recently. Bottom simulating reflectors (BSR) observed are probably due to structure II hydrates formed from gas containing higher order hydrocarbon components such as ethane, propane, etc. along with methane. The study area falls close to the new gigantic oil discoveries, Skrugard and Havis, and north of the Snøhvit hydrocarbon field.","pockmarks,gas hydrate,BSR,gas flares,Barents Sea,seismic,"
"variability of lightning activity in south/southeast asia during 1997–98 and 2002–03 el nino/la nina events","2012","Impacts of the 1997–98 and 2002–03 ENSOs on total number of flashes and number of flash days from the LIS (Lightning Imaging Sensor) on board the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission satellite and on the average flash rate from the combined OTD (Optical Transient Detector) / LIS data are studied in South/Southeast Asia (8° –30°N, 60°–120°E) for the period 1998–2005. Also examined is the difference between the geographical distributions of these parameters in the El Nino period in 1998 and in the corresponding normal period in 1999. During the 1997–98 ENSO event, the number of flashes and average flash rate increase by 12% and 36%, respectively, during the El Nino period and during the La Nina period decrease by 22% and 5%, respectively, as compared to the corresponding normal periods. Similarly, during the 2002–2003 ENSO event, the number of flashes and average flash rate increase by 28% and 5% during the El Nino period in 2002 as compared to the corresponding normal period. The contrast in lightning activity between the El Nino and La Nina periods is more pronounced in Southeast Asia than in South Asia because of the southeastward shift in the convection activity during the ENSO events. In both regions, however, monthly variations of both total number of flashes and average flash rate are almost parallel to that of surface temperature. Although, the inverse relationship between the Indian Summer Monsoon Rainfall (ISMR) and El Nino broke down in 1997–98, the relationship between the El Nino and lightning maintains its normal increasing trend, indicating that the lightning activity is more sensitive to the convective activity than to rainfall on seasonal time scale. The total number of flashes and aerosol loading increase in the break‐period regime as compared to the monsoonal regime. The number of flash days in both ENSO events is higher in the EL Nino phase and lower in the La Nina phase as compared to their normal values in the subsequent years. Enhancement of lightning activity is mostly concentrated over land areas. Our results show that although diurnal variations in lightning activity can be related to the variations in surface temperature, convective adjustment induced by the corresponding ENSO phase needs to be considered for explaining the lightning activity variations on these longer time scales.","ENSO impact,South/Southeast Asia,El Nino impact,Lightning activity,"
"a multi-proxy reconstruction of tropical cyclone variability during the past 800 years from robinson lake, nova scotia, canada","2018","This study presents a multi-proxy reconstruction of tropical cyclone (TC) activity for the past 800 years from Robinson Lake, located on the north Atlantic seaboard of Nova Scotia, Canada. Two sediment cores were extracted from Robinson Lake and were dated by 210Pb and 14C methods, and analyzed for organic matter content, sediment grain size, and a range of elements and elemental ratios determined by XRF core scanning. A distinct sand layer in the most recent sediments is attributed to Hurricane Juan, which struck the coast of Nova Scotia on September 29, 2003. Our study shows that peaks in grain size farther down-core are generally correlated with abrupt increases in Br and Br/Ti. XRF-derived Br measurements are an indicator of marine organic carbon (MOC), and the increases in Br likely reflect incursions of marine water and nutrients into the lake as a result of storm surges. The results show that the period from ~1475 to 1670 CE contains at least 3–4 storm beds, and are interpreted as the most active TC period within the last ~800 years for this region. Our results are consistent with recent research from Salt Pond, Massachusetts (Donnelly et al. 2015), which provides evidence for heightened TC activity during the same period as our study at Robinson Lake. Our study represents one of the highest latitude paleotempestological studies from the North Atlantic basin which will help the testing of hypotheses concerning long-term changes in North Atlantic TC activity under future climate change scenarios.","X-ray fluorescence,Grain size analysis,North Atlantic,Tropical cyclones,Paleotempestology,"
"deep learning-powered vessel trajectory prediction for improving smart traffic services in maritime internet of things","2022","The maritime Internet of Things (IoT) has recently emerged as a revolutionary communication paradigm where a large number of moving vessels are closely interconnected in intelligent maritime networks. However, the tremendous growth of vessel trajectories, collected from the combined satellite-terrestrial AIS (automatic identification system) base stations, could lead to unsatisfactory maritime safety and efficacy. To promote smart traffic services in maritime IoT, it is necessary to accurately and robustly predict the spatiotemporal vessel trajectories. It is beneficial for collision avoidance, maritime surveillance, and abnormal behavior detection, etc. Motivated by the strong learning capacity of deep neural networks, this work proposes an AIS data-driven trajectory prediction framework, whose main component is a long short term memory (LSTM) network. In particular, the vessel traffic conflict situation modeling, generated using the dynamic AIS data and social force concept, is embedded into the LSTM network to guarantee high-accuracy vessel trajectory prediction. In addition, a mixed loss function is reconstructed to make our prediction results more reliable and robust in different navigation environments. Several quantitative and qualitative experiments have been implemented on realistic AIS-based vessel trajectories. Our results have demonstrated that the proposed method could achieve satisfactory prediction performance in terms of accuracy and robustness.","surveillance,dynamic AIS data,LSTM network,Hidden Markov models,deep learning (artificial intelligence),Internet of Things,smart traffic service improvement,abnormal behavior detection,high-accuracy vessel trajectory prediction,intelligent maritime networks,Predictive models,deep learning-powered vessel trajectory prediction,maritime IoT,deep neural networks,Maritime Internt of Things,deep learning,moving vessels,ships,automatic identification system,marine safety,marine engineering,maritime surveillance,vessel traffic services,AIS data-driven trajectory prediction framework,vessel traffic conflict situation modeling,6G mobile communication,maritime Internet of Things,Artificial intelligence,spatiotemporal vessel trajectories,revolutionary communication paradigm,long-short-term memory network,Trajectory,trajectory prediction,Navigation,combined satellite-terrestrial AIS,marine vehicles,realistic AIS-based vessel trajectories,unsatisfactory maritime safety,satisfactory prediction performance,"
"a proactive system for maritime environment monitoring","2016","The ability to remotely detect and monitor oil spills is becoming increasingly important due to the high demand of oil-based products.

"the changing role of fire in conifer-dominated temperate rainforest through the last 14,000 years","2018","Climate, fire and vegetation dynamics are often tightly coupled through time. Here, we use a 14 kyr sedimentary charcoal and pollen record from Lake Osborne, Tasmania, Australia, to explore how this relationship changes under varying climatic regimes within a temperate rainforest ecosystem. Superposed epoch analysis reveals a significant relationship between fire and vegetation change throughout the Holocene at our site. Our data indicates an initial resilience of the rainforest system to fire under a stable cool and humid climate regime between ca. 12–6 ka. In contrast, fires that occurred after 6 ka, under an increasingly variable climate regime wrought by the onset of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), resulted in a series of changes within the local rainforest vegetation that culminated in the replacement of rainforest by fire-promoted Eucalypt forest. We suggest that an increasingly variable ENSO-influenced climate regime inhibited rainforest recovery from fire because of slower growth, reduced fecundity and increased fire frequency, thus contributing to the eventual collapse of the rainforest system.","Rainforest,Pollen,El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO),Superposed epoch analysis (SEA),Tasmania,Charcoal,"
"long-distance mobility in the north-western mediterranean during the neolithic transition using high resolution pottery sourcing","2019","The Neolithisation of the North-Western Mediterranean is still an open issue. New data has recently enriched the chronological and cultural archaeological framework, providing more precise absolute dates and revealing a new and more complex process of expansion of farming in Southern Europe. The Mediterranean route of colonization (6000–5600 BCE), is characterized by the so-called Impressed Wares (IW) or Impresso-Cardial Complex (ICC) which demonstrate huge internal diversity in material culture, notably in pottery style and technology. This polythetic imprint of the ICC is intimately linked to dynamics of raw material exploitation (such as obsidian) and interconnections within circulation and exchange networks of goods. Through a comparative and multi-analytical approach to pottery characterization of entire assemblages from two distant sites in the North-Western Mediterranean, each characterized by predominantly local pottery production, we demonstrate long-distance mobility of non-local pottery vessels from the Tyrrhenian regions towards the Languedoc (up to 1000 km) during the Neolithic transition. Our study allows us to highlight this unexpected milestone in the first Neolithic migration in the North-Western Mediterranean.","Impressa ware,Pottery analysis,Ceramic petrography,Early Neolithic,Geochemistry,Provenance study,"
"mercury evidence of intense submarine volcanism and hydrothermal activity during a mid-tournaisian anoxic event in the carnic alps","2022","The mid-Tournaisian Event, or Lower Alum Shale Event (LASE), is linked to severe facies changes including pelagic carbonates and widespread black siliceous shales and radiolarites in many parts of the world. For the first time, high-resolution inorganic geochemistry and framboidal pyrite analyses were applied to decipher depositional condition changes during the mid-Tournaisian event in the Carnic Alps. The predominance of tiny pyrite framboids, high Corg/P, U/Th, and V/Cr ratios, generally higher enrichments of redox-sensitive metals such as Mo, U, V, and depletion in Mn suggest anoxic/euxinic conditions at the sea bottom. Moreover, we found very large anomalous Hg spikes (with maximum values reaching 3650 ppb) for the first time in the mid-Tournaisian deep-water marine succession of the Carnic Alps. Our results suggest intense volcanism during the LASE, which triggered the mid-Tournaisian anoxic event. The most likely candidate for the observed Hg anomalous contents is submarine arc volcanism and hydrothermal activity connected with the collision of the peri-Gondwanan terranes Paleo-Adria and probably Armorican Terrane Assemblage (ATA) and/or Noric terrane during the first phase of the Variscan orogeny.","Anoxia,Organic-rich rocks,Mid-Tournaisian Event,The Lower Alum Shale Event,Mercury,Volcanism,"
"weather-aware object detection method for maritime surveillance systems","2023","The development of machine learning-based maritime object detection technology aims to assist ship operators in maritime surveillance. However, as maritime environments can be quite complex, developing object detection models that can handle these situations is a challenging research problem, particularly when dealing with adverse weather conditions like rain and haze. While prior research has attempted to remove weather noise and improve object detection models under various weather conditions, they are limited by computing resources and hard to adapt to the constantly changing weather conditions of maritime environments. Preventing performance degradation as weather conditions shift is a significant challenge in maritime surveillance systems. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a weather-aware object detection method, Weather-OD, that employs an on-board edge and on-shore cloud-based system for maritime surveillance. It employs specialized machine learning models for object detection, which can be dynamically selected based on the weather conditions to ensure highly accurate object detection with low latency at sea. Weather-OD continuously improves accuracy by periodically training the models with newly collected datasets during voyages, and efficiently manages the life cycle of multiple object detection models, taking into account the constraints of limited edge computing resources. In addition, Weather-OD uses synthetic image data with weather noise to supplement the training data under different weather conditions. We conducted an evaluation of our weather-aware object detection models using a maritime benchmark dataset, the Singapore Maritime Dataset. Our experimental results demonstrated the feasibility of our mechanism with weather classification and a significant improvement in the mean Average Precision (mAP) of maritime object detection in rainy and hazy conditions. Additionally, our approach enables the continuous improvement of object detection accuracy through model retraining with small datasets.","Edge cloud,Maritime surveillance,Weather-aware,Object detection,Adaptation,Model specialization,"
"maritime environment perception based on deep learning","2022","Environment perception is an essential aspect of automated maritime vehicles, especially in high-traffic areas. In recent years, deep-learning-based object detection using LiDAR has been well developed in the automotive sector but has not yet seen a similar level of sophisticated development in maritime applications. In these applications, LiDAR detection should be fused with other maritime navigation systems such as the automatic identification system (AIS) to expand the detection range. To address this, we propose a novel deep-learning-based concept for maritime environment perception by using LiDAR as a primary sensor and AIS as an assisting information source. This approach consists of three functional modules: object detection, multi-object tracking, and static environment mapping. For object detection, we apply a convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect floating objects represented as oriented bounding boxes. To train the CNN, we propose a method that generates simulated labeled datasets. The detected objects from CNN are tracked with Kalman Filter banks. The remaining LiDAR data points are treated as static environments and represented by polygons. We evaluated the approach by using simulative and real-world datasets. In the simulation, the average precision of the CNN object detector reaches 60.8%, with a data processing rate of 40 Hz in GPU. Our real-world evaluations show that this approach can track 83% of the vessels in a crowded harbor, with the overall intersection over union reaching 64%.

"a method for ice-aware maritime route optimization","2014","We present a method for ice-aware maritime route optimization. Our aim is to increase the safety and efficiency of maritime transport under icy conditions. The proposed method is based on the Aâˆ— algorithm, developed by Hart et al.

The ship performance model, based on previous work by Kotovirta et al., estimates ship transit speed as a function of ice conditions and ship design parameters. The main novelties in this paper are the application of the Aâˆ— algorithm to maritime route optimization and development of an associated cost function that takes into account ice conditions and available icebreaker assistance.

"solar and tropical ocean forcing of late-holocene climate change in coastal east asia","2017","In this study, paleoclimate signals were extracted from high-resolution sediment records very recently produced from the Mulyoungari swamp on Jeju Island, South Korea and examined to determine the main factors driving late Holocene climate change in East Asia. The high resolution of the Mulyoungari records allows the detection of multidecadal to centennial-scale climate change with various cycles. This enables comparisons with important paleoclimate proxies such as total solar irradiation (ΔTSI) and sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the western tropical Pacific (WTP). Spectral analyses of pollen and magnetic susceptibility (MS) data identify significant periodicities of 780, 470, 135–145, and 50–70years. The Mulyoungari swamp responded sensitively to global climate change during the Holocene, showing well known Holocene cycles in the results. Our tree pollen index of warmness (TPIW) shows important late Holocene cold events associated with low sunspot periods such as Oort, Wolf, Spörer, and Maunder Minimum. Comparisons among standard Z-scores of filtered TPIW, ΔTSI, and other paleoclimate records from central and northeastern China, off the coast of northern Japan, southern Philippines, and Peru all demonstrate significant relationships. This suggests that solar activity drove Holocene variations in both East Asian Monsoon (EAM) and El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO). In particular, the latter seems to have predominantly controlled the coastal climate of East Asia to the extent that the influence of precession was nearly muted during the late Holocene.","Western tropical Pacific,East Asian Monsoon,Late Holocene,Solar activity,Jeju Island,El Niño Southern-Oscillation,"
"dem analyses and morphotectonic interpretation: the plio-quaternary evolution of the eastern ligurian alps, italy","2012","The Ligurian Alps (Italy) straddle a complex and ill-defined tectonic transition that accommodates Eurasia–Adria shortening driving concurrent growth of the western Alps and northern Apennines. We focus on the Plio-Quaternary landscape evolution of the eastern part of the Ligurian Alps with the goal of defining the active tectonics through an analysis of topography, drainage networks, and river long profiles. The Ligurian Alps have a steep, seaward-facing escarpment with topographic features reminiscent of the geomorphic markers preserved on both actively-uplifting coastlines and passive margins. For example, there are seaward-facing benches that are thought to be uplifted marine terraces common to active margins; but the drainage divide of the seaward escarpment shows clear evidence of recent northward migration into the Po foreland, a process consistent with escarpment retreat characteristic of passive or subsiding margins. This study explores the active tectonics consistent with these diverse landscape evolution pathways. Our analysis reveals that rock-type strongly throttles the development of topographic relief, drainage networks, and northward migration of the drainage divide. However, we also identify segments of the escarpment that indicate recent base level falls through an analysis of modeled channel steepness and comparison with mean hillslope gradient. The base level falls are consistent with numerous barbed tributaries that are best explained as recent stream captures. No significant correlation among the stream captures at the drainage divide, suspected marine terraces at the coast, Ligurian Sea bathymetry, and active seismicity indicates that the escarpment is the footwall of a segmented normal fault. This normal fault is embedded in a regionally subsiding margin where actively uplifting segments lead to a straightened, pinned drainage divide, whereas, relatively inactive segments permit divide migration into the footwall block. These results are broadly consistent with rock uplift increasing eastward toward Genova across the long-suspected Alps–Apennine Sestri–Voltaggio fault zone. They highlight the respective roles of legacy structures, rock-type, and localized rock uplift in constructing a landscape in an otherwise extending and subsiding crustal retrowedge of an active subduction plate boundary.","Tectonic geomorphology,DEM analysis,Ligurian Alps,River longitudinal profile,"

Our simulation results show that the proposed approach can reduce the transmission cost dramatically under the varying channel conditions of the different networks.","Markov processes,multiband maritime communication system,Markov Decision Process,wireless systems,Monitoring,Reliability,Communication networks,stochastic Markov decision process,mobile radio,least cost network selection scheme,delay constrained transmission,radio networks,Steady-state,Network Selection,decision criterion,marine communication,shipment information,Simulation,Temperature sensors,prespecified time constraint,"
"noise reduction and atmospheric correction for coastal applications of landsat thematic mapper imagery","1999","The Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) has three visible bands centered at 485 nm, 560 nm, and 660 nm which can be used for ocean applications. This article presents a method for deriving the bottom albedo from the TM in coastal waters. Our study of historical TM images shows degradation of the sensor through time. Pattern noise in the imagery in Bands 2 and 3 was analyzed and removed using a combination of Fourier filtering and edge-detection techniques. Noise was first examined over clear and deep nearby oceanic waters, and the filter algorithms developed there were applied to the entire image. To estimate water-leaving radiance from the satellite sensor, Rayleigh and aerosol path radiance were removed. Radiance due to aerosol scattering was calculated for offshore pixels assuming a marine aerosol type, and it was removed as a constant from the entire scene. The TM sensor calibration was validated by comparing water-leaving radiance values over the clear waters of the Florida current with known, normalized water-leaving radiance values. Corrections for water path radiance and water-column attenuation of bottom-reflected radiance were made for regions of known depth, allowing the bottom albedo and vegetative pixel fraction to be determined for shallow reef areas in the Florida Keys.",""
"neighborhood rough residual networkâ€“based outlier detection method in iot-enabled maritime transportation systems","2023","Outlier detection can identify anomalies in large-scale data. To provide reliability and security for Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled maritime transportation systems (MTSs), in this paper we propose an outlier detection method based on the neighborhood rough residual network (NRRN). We calculate the neighborhood approximation accuracy and neighborhood conditional entropy to obtain the neighborhood combined entropy describing the discrimination ability of the condition attribute subset to the information system. We then delete the redundant attributes according to the attribute combination importance derived from the neighborhood combined entropy. The data after attribute reduction are used to train the convolutional neural network, and the residual network (ResNet50) is used to avoid the degradation of model performance caused by the increase in the number of network layers. The proposed method is compared with mainstream outlier detection algorithms on a fishing vessel operation dataset. Experiments show that the proposed method can greatly improve the accuracy of outlier detection while taking into account interpretability and computational efficiency, thereby ensuring the data integrity of IoT-enabled MTSs.","Outlier detection,Data models,residual network,neighborhood combined entropy,Transportation,Entropy,data integrity,Anomaly detection,Behavioral sciences,Marine vehicles,Residual neural networks,IoT-enabled maritime transportation systems,"
"galernas: a history of coastally trapped disturbances (2003−2020) with hidden frontogenesis in the bay of biscay","2023","Galerna is the term accepted for an abrupt westerly change that affects the north coast of Spain. The wind surge travels from the mid-north coast of Spain to France, generally reaching their maximum intensity at the Basque Coast, and cuts off a period of hot weather, clear skies, and calm conditions at sea. The galernas have a large history of shipwrecks and fishermen deaths. They have been characterized as coastally trapped disturbances (CTD) and their propagation, enhanced with the local formation of a micro-front, was documented to behave like a density current. Alternatively, synoptic fronts have also been reported to cause galernas, considered to be more intense than those generated by a local micro-front. In this article we have generated the first climatology (2003–2020) of these events based on an objective identification methodology. The developed Event Identification Software (EIS), based on both 10-min surface station data and hourly ERA5 reanalysis fields, together with a new Front Identification Scheme (FIS) have enabled a deeper study into the origin and development of these micro-fronts, and a more comprehensive exploration of the interaction of the oceanic fronts entering the Bay of Biscay. Our results show that the area receives an average of four to five relatively intense galernas (Vmax > 50 km h−1) per year. Their number shows a great interannual variability (from one to seven) and a marked seasonality: May and June concentrate the largest fraction (almost one episode each year) and practically no episodes in winter. They occur more frequently between noon and the late afternoon, where the most intense wind records concentrate. Very strong galernas (Vmax > 72 km h−1) have occurred in all 18 years, can happen in any month from February to November, and their monthly distribution does not show the mentioned seasonality. On the contrary, the highest rates of temperature decrease across the galerna front in the coastal stations (−∆T/0.5 h > 4 °C) do have a stronger seasonality, with May and June concentrating a relatively large number of cases with a more abrupt temperature drop. The FIS shows that most of the galernas (83.5%) have a local origin inside the Bay of Biscay, and only a few ones (16.5%) are caused by oceanic fronts initiated out of the region. The local frontogenesis is more frequently initiated by the relatively cold marine southwesterly pre-frontals preceding a parent oceanic front and blowing against the warm continentals inside the Bay of Biscay, after being ducted along the north and northwestern coast of Spain. This hidden local frontogenesis, first revealed by the FIS, seems to be enhanced by the observed lee troughing, which could have both a thermal and dynamic origin, acting simultaneously after the intense Foehn at the coastal strip, preceding the formation of the galerna front. The local front enhancement appears to be the reason for the apparent jump of the primary front, which may eventually weaken, and even disappear, as the galerna front sharpens. Even during the more occasional frontal galernas, directly caused by the westerlies or north-westerlies behind the oceanic front, their eastward propagation is more rapid over the coastal area. The front deforms in shape and may cause its characteristic unexpected/abrupt irruption. All the EIS detected galernas, even the frontal ones, are wind reversals caused by a coastally trapped marine boundary layer. The upper-level ridge over Europe, observed in all of them, seems to be a synoptic ingredient for their development, preventing the eastward propagation of Atlantic depressions and enhancing at the same time the temperature and pressure gradients between the marine and continental air masses.","Bay of Biscay,Galerna,Frontogenesis,Mesofront,Coastally trapped disturbances,"
"signal strength sensitivity and its effects on routing in maritime wireless networks","2008","Unlike terrestrial networks, the received signal strength in maritime wireless networks are subjected to perturbations due to the sea movement. Surface motions at sea cause variations in antenna heights and orientations of the communicating node (e.g. ships and buoys), thus affecting the received signal strength. In order to minimize such undesirable effects, we carried out a detailed study of the relationship between sea waves and the received signal strength. The effect of antenna gain variations due to tilting of antenna masts were studied by modeling sea waves. The channel path-loss variations were studied using a two-ray path-loss model for the maritime environment. Our analysis showed that the sea wave movements affect both short and longer links. We proposed a simple scheme to avoid the use of unstable links and implemented it on the QualNet network simulator. We carried out IEEE 802.16-based mesh network simulations with sea terrain and path loss models. We observed performance improvements in packet delay and throughput when the stable link selection scheme was used.","receiving antennas,Antennas,radio links,antenna heights variations,antenna masts tilting,channel path-loss variations,Distance measurement,Marine vehicles,QualNet network simulator,IEEE 802.16-based mesh network simulations,unstable links,sea waves,packet delay,maritime wireless networks routing,antenna gain variations,sea terrain,Gain,Receiving antennas,marine communication,signal strength sensitivity,communicating node,two-ray path-loss model,Signal to noise ratio,Interference,received signal strength,WiMax,"
"benchmarking of emulated wireless edge cloud connectivity for maritime environments","2022","Remote ship pilotage, smart fairway navigation, autonomous maritime transport and smart maritime logistics present new challenges to the maritime industry. One of the challenges is increasing dependency on reliable network connectivity that can range from low priority entertainment communications to high priority safety critical communications. Traffic prioritization is needed at the open sea, where ships typically resort to expensive satellite connectivity that incurs long latency and narrow bandwidth. Near the coastline, ships can switch to 5G-based communications with low latency and high bandwidth, and possibly even utilize low-latency edge computing capabilities. Our contribution in this paper is a cloud-based networking testbed that supports network traffic shaping to emulate satellite and 5G-based communications between an edge cloud located onboard a ship and another edge cloud located onboard another ship or at the shore under traffic loss scenarios. Potential use-cases for our work include emulation of peer-to-peer communications (i.e., ship-to-ship or ship-to-shore) and mesh networking. The system can also be used as a basis for real-time ship networking, for instance, as building block for traffic prioritization in Kubernetes-based edge clouds.","Satellites,autonomous maritime transport,smart maritime logistics,maritime,cloud-based networking,Safety,telecommunication computing,high priority safety critical communications,peer-to-peer communications,Telecommunication traffic,ship-to-shore,Switches,satellite,Wireless communication,reliable network connectivity,edge cloud,5G mobile communication,logistics,ships,marine safety,low-latency edge computing capabilities,5G,cloud computing,narrow bandwidth,real-time ship networking,emulated wireless edge cloud connectivity,low priority entertainment communications,maritime environments,remote ship pilotage,edge computing,networking,network traffic,traffic prioritization,ship-to-ship,Bandwidth,traffic loss scenarios,telecommunication traffic,Cloud computing,open sea,Kubernetes,smart fairway navigation,maritime industry,expensive satellite connectivity,Kubernetes-based edge clouds,"
"bayesian filtering for dynamic anomaly detection and tracking","2022","This article presents a Bayesian approach for sequential detection of anomalies in the motion of a target and joint tracking. The anomaly is modeled as a binary (on/off) switching unknown control input that goes into action (begins to exist, or â€œswitches onâ€) thereby modifying the object dynamics; and by ceasing its activity (becoming nonexistent, or â€œswitching offâ€) returns the dynamics to nominal. The developed Bayesian framework brings together random finite set (RFS) theory to represent the switching nature of the anomaly, and optimal joint input and state estimation to sequentially update a hybrid state that incorporates a random vector for the kinematic state and a Bernoulli RFS for the unknown control input. In addition, a closed-form solution, the Gaussian-mixture hybrid Bernoulli filter (GM-HBF), has been developed to provide a customized solution for dynamic anomaly detection in the maritime domain characterized by linear Gaussian target dynamics. Based on the Ornsteinâ€“Uhlenbeck dynamic model for vessels, where the evolution of the object velocity is governed by a piecewise mean-reverting stochastic process, the anomaly can be represented by a change in the long-run mean velocity (i.e., the unknown control input) from the nominal condition that forces the vessel to deviate from its standard route. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed GM-HBF in both simulated and real-world maritime surveillance applications and test its performance in the face of false measurements, detection uncertainty, and sensor data gaps.","developed Bayesian framework,surveillance,kinematic state,Mathematical models,Anomaly detection,Automatic identification system (AIS),Bayesian approach,random finite sets (RFSs),Bayesian filtering,Bayes methods,object dynamics,linear Gaussian target dynamics,Switches,Bernoulli filter,switching unknown control input,Radio frequency,target tracking,Aerodynamics,stochastic processes,filtering theory,radar,state estimation,detection uncertainty,Gaussian processes,Bernoulli RFS,Radar tracking,maritime anomaly detection,dynamic anomaly detection,joint input and state estimation (JISE),probability,Ornstein-Uhlenbeck dynamic model,GM-HBF,Gaussian-mixture hybrid Bernoulli filter,"

With the extensive data set now available for the state, the linear relation of heat flow and heat production appears as a very useful generalization for the study of the heat flow field of a geological province. Our measurements indicate that the vertical distribution of radiogenic heat production is similar in plutonic and metasedimentary rocks. Our data are compatible with the linear relationship established earlier by F. Birch and his co-workers in 1968. Young granites are markedly enriched in radioactive elements and those which do not outcrop are revealed by anomalies in the general relation of heat flow versus radioactivity. Heat flow is high for plutons by low elsewhere. The mean heat flow through metasedimentary formations is 1.15 μcal/cm2 s (48 mW/m2), a value near the mean heat flow for old cratons. The lowest heat flow measured is 0.76 μcal/cm2 s (32 mW/m2) for a unit poor in radioactivity. The heat flow field grades smoothly into the low heat flow regions of the Canadian Shield. The New Hampshire region is in thermal equilibrium: its heat flow is in secular equilibrium with the heat generated by crustal sources and that supplied from the mantle. In this area, the thermal perturbations due to orogenic events decrease below the detection level in less than 200–275 Ma.

"eloran: resilient positioning, navigation, and timing infrastructure in maritime areas","2020","Global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and localization technology have become highly compact and effective. Although GNSS has been proven to be vulnerable to jamming when the signal strength is weak, most vehicles rely on it for navigation. Compared to GNSS, enhanced Loran (eLoran) is more resistant to jamming and is recommended as a realistic alternative to GNSS. Therefore, South Korea embarked on an eLoran testbed development project to provide resilient navigation information for maritime users. The primary goal of this project was to demonstrate that the system can provide a 20-m position accuracy to the maritime user within a 30-km coverage of a differential Loran station. In this paper, we describe the development of the eLoran testbed implementation and the performance of its preliminary experimental results. To confirm the feasibility of the eLoran testbed performance, we installed an eLoran transmitter and two differential Loran stations and subsequently conducted a zero-baseline performance test at the Pyeongtaek differential Loran station with a new eLoran signal. We also conducted a survey to collect conventional Loran signals along the western and southern coastlines of South Korea. Our experimental results show that the eLoran system met the performance requirements of this project, as well as that the signal to noise ratio of the eLoran signals changed over the topographic characteristics of the propagation path.","differential Loran station,GNSS,eLoran testbed,signal processing,Monitoring,topographic characteristics,performance requirements,signal strength,Global Positioning System,enhanced Loran,Transmitters,Radio navigation,timing infrastructure,jamming,eLoran testbed performance,jamming resistant,South Korea,satellite navigation,southern coastlines,propagation path,maritime navigation,western coastlines,Pyeongtaek differential Loran station,eLoran transmitter,eLoran testbed implementation,maritime areas,eLoran signal,eLoran testbed development project,eLoran system,localization technology,resilient positioning,GNSS backup,zero-baseline performance test,global navigation satellite system,marine communication,maritime user,radio transmitters,resilient navigation information,Global navigation satellite system,resilient PNT,"
"ten years of monitoring air quality and ecological integrity using field-identifiable lichens at kejimkujik national park and national historic site in nova scotia, canada","2017","Arboreal lichens have a wide range of tolerance to habitat disturbance. As a result, they have been used globally as bioindicators of environmental change, particularly for monitoring atmospheric pollution. Here, we use lichens to monitor air quality and ecological integrity (EI) at Kejimkujik National Park and National Historic Site in Nova Scotia, Canada. We provide descriptions of two protocols and compare the results using data gathered in 2006, 2011, and 2016. To monitor air quality, we established 12 monitoring sites throughout the park and used a suite of lichens that are intolerant to air pollution to develop an index of air purity (IAP) that we compared every 5 years. Our protocol for monitoring EI of forest ecosystems was set up at these same 12 sites. We selected 50 regionally common field-identifiable lichen species and genera ranging in sensitivity from disturbance-tolerant to intolerant, and compare their presence in spatially constrained zones on a variety of tree species every 5 years. Our results suggest that air quality in Kejimkujik has increased slightly in the 10 years since monitoring was implemented, which is consistent with improvements in local air quality. Species richness also increased slightly, suggesting that EI has not declined. The maintenance of EI, through protection and restoration of natural resources, is a key priority in the management of national parks in Canada. Our protocols will provide early detection of changes to EI, enabling park managers to take responsive action. We are confident that our protocols can be replicated in other parts of the world with different suites of regionally common lichens.","Sustainable forest management,Index of air purity,Maritimes,Acadian forest,Bio-monitoring,"
"ship classification based on ship behavior clustering from ais data","2019","Since the introduction of the Automatic Identification System (AIS), AIS data has proven to be a valuable source of ship behavior analysis using data mining. It records ship position, speed and other behavior attributes at specific time intervals in all voyages at sea and in ports. However, the current studies in ship behavior analyze the behavior patterns either with a subjective choice of classification for behavior differences among the groups of ships or without any classification at all. In order to fill this gap, a new methodology for ship classification in ports based on behavior clustering is developed by analyzing AIS data from the port of Rotterdam. Besides a proper data preparation, the proposed methodology consists of two steps: step I, clustering ship behavior in a port area and identifying the characteristics of the clusters; step II, classifying ships to such behavior clusters based on the ship characteristics. The clustering results present both the behavior patterns and the behavior change patterns for ship path and speed over ground, which are the dominant behavior attributes for ships in ports. Some patterns of integral ship behavior can also be revealed by investigating the correlation between the two behavior attributes. Our research has shown that length and beam can be adopted as explanatory variable to classify ships to the corresponding behavior clusters. The classifiers are developed based on both unsupervised discretization (equal width binning) and supervised discretization (Chi2). The performances of classifiers are compared by three evaluation metrics, including Average Accuracy, F1score, and AUC. We found that the classification based on multi-criteria is more accurate than using a single criterion. The classifications based on Chi2 discretization outperform the ones with equal width discretization. The outcome leads to a systematic understanding of ship behavior in a port area and can be used to predict the ship behavior pattern based on their characteristics and simulate the ship behavior.","Ship classification,Ports and waterways,Behavior clustering,Data mining,AIS data,"
"context-enhanced vessel prediction based on ornstein-uhlenbeck processes using historical ais traffic patterns: real-world experimental results","2014","Traffic route analysis and prediction are both essential for maritime security. Specifically, the prediction of a vessel position is useful to provide alerts about upcoming events (e.g., opportunities and threats). However, accurate prediction along a route in the maritime domain is a challenging task, due to the complex and dynamic nature of traffic patterns. This paper presents a vessel prediction method, based on the popular Ornstein-Uhlenbeck stochastic processes, whose parameters are estimated from historical patterns of life. The historical traffic routes are obtained by pre-processing Automatic Identification System (AIS) data via the CMRE tool called Traffic Route Extraction for Anomaly Detection (TREAD). These recurrent routes allow prediction of the position of a vessel that is following one of these routes, surprisingly, by several hours. The method is validated using a case study related to the second data campaign of the EC FP7 Project New Service Capabilities for Integrated and Advanced Maritime Surveillance (NEREIDS)1.

"spatial clustering method of historical ais data for maritime traffic routes extraction","2022","The automated extraction of maritime routes that accurately resembles the real traffic of vessels is crucial for intelligent traffic management systems to understand vessel behaviour in sea areas, identify events, and support decision-making. Available solutions for maritime traffic route extraction utilize traditional clustering algorithms, which have high computational costs. Data reduction methods are proposed for use with these clustering methods to improve clustering performance, which involves a loss in movement pattern quality. Such solutions often result in low quality representations of traffic routes, which poorly estimate sailing distances for long journeys and time of arrivals and poorly identify non-conformities. In this paper, we propose a spatial clustering method (SPTCLUST-II) to extract spatial representations of sailing routes from historical Automatic Identification System (AIS) data. Our method can cluster huge volumes of trajectory data in a minimal amount of time without using any of the traditional clustering algorithms and with no reduction or modification of the spatio-temporal predicates of the original trajectories. A real-world AIS dataset captured in the area of the Gulf of Mexico is used for the evaluation of the proposed method. The results demonstrate that the proposed method extracts tankers maritime traffic routes with an accuracy of 97% and a f1-measure of 98.5% and cargoes maritime traffic routes with an accuracy of 98.1% and a f1-measure of 99%.

Multiple hypothesis testing suggests a framework to enlist reliable information from monitoring systems (coastal radars and space-born satellite sensors) in support of detection of anomalies, spoofing, and stealth deviations.

We bring into account a new and influential asset - human intuition and perception - to the existing semi-automated decision support systems that mostly rely on numerical data collected by electronic sensors or cameras located either directly on the vessels or in the maritime command-and-control centers. For our project, we gathered weekly textual reports spanning twelve months from the United States Worldwide Threats to Shipping Reports repository that belongs to the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), We considered the maritime incident reports written by human operators as a valuable and accessible unstructured textual input source in which a span of text1 is called â€œriskâ€ if it expresses one of the following kinds of vessel incidents: fired, robbed, boarded, hijacked, attacked, chased, approached, kidnapped, boarding attempted, suspiciously approached or clashed with.

These distributions are captured and used to anchor the span of â€œrisksâ€ as they are described in the textual reports. After some preprocessing steps that include tokenization, named entity extraction and part-of-speech tagging, the textual risk mining system applies a variety of sequence classification algorithms, e.g., Conditional Random Fields, Conditional Markov Models and Hidden Markov Models in order to compare the risk classification performance.

"seamless and intelligent resource allocation in 6g maritime networks framework via deep reinforcement learning","2023","Sixth-generation (6G) communication networks will fulfill usersâ€™ requests for high data speeds and low latency without causing network outages throughout the world. However, marine communication in deep-sea waters is expanding as maritime traffic grows. To serve mission-critical applications, a growing number of maritime end-users require high throughput and low latency. Although deep-sea satellite connections will enable 6G networks, however due to limited service capacity owing to the long propagation delay between end-user and satellites. We propose unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as aerial backhauling and a relay medium in the marine communication network assisted by satellites and coastal base stations (BSs). The power allocation strategy of multi-satellites for a 6G network is investigated in this work. The power allocation problem is non-convex, hence deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is used to solve it instead of the conventional optimization technique. Our research aims to optimize the networkâ€™s total capacity in the case when the satellites are randomly and densely dispersed.

"multiple ornsteinâ€“uhlenbeck processes for maritime traffic graph representation","2018","We propose an unsupervised procedure to automatically extract a graph-based model of commercial maritime traffic routes from historical Automatic Identification System (AIS) data. In the proposed representation, the main elements of maritime traffic patterns, such as maneuvering regions and sea-lanes, are represented, respectively, with graph vertices and edges. Vessel motion dynamics are defined by multiple Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes with different long-run mean parameters, which in our approach can be estimated with a change detection procedure based on Page's test, aimed to reveal the spatial points representative of velocity changes. A density-based clustering algorithm is then applied to aggregate the detected changes into groups of similar elements and reject outliers. To validate the proposed graph-based representation of the maritime traffic, two performance criteria are tested against a real-world trajectory dataset collected off the Iberian Coast and the English Channel. Results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach, which is suitable to be integrated at any level of a JDL system.","automatic identification system data,unsupervised learning,density-based clustering algorithm,Marine vehicles,maritime traffic routes,Mathematical model,JDL system,maritime traffic patterns,Pages Test OU Process,maneuvering regions,Stochastic processes,Electronic mail,Maritime Surveillance Awareness (MSA),DBSCAN,ships,vessel motion dynamics,marine engineering,spatial points representative,Page's test,Data models,unsupervised procedure,maritime traffic graph representation,pattern clustering,Artificial intelligence,English Channel,graph theory,Trajectory,multiple Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes,trajectory dataset,sea-lanes,long-run mean parameters,Iberian Coast,collision avoidance,AIS data,Graph-based Maritime Traffic Representation,change detection procedure,"
"a machine learning approach for monitoring ship safety in extreme weather events","2021","Extreme weather events can result in loss of life, environmental pollution and major damage to vessels caught in their path. Many methods to characterise this risk have been proposed, however, they typically utilise deterministic thresholds of wind and wave limits which might not accurately reflect risk. To address this limitation, we investigate the potential of machine learning algorithms to quantify the relative likelihood of an incident during the US Atlantic hurricane season. By training an algorithm on vessel traffic, weather and historical casualty data, accident candidates can be identified from historic vessel tracks. Amongst the various methods tested, Support Vector Machines showed good performance with Recall at 95% and Accuracy reaching 92%. Finally, we implement the developed model using a case study of Hurricane Matthew (October 2016). Our method contributes to enhancements in maritime safety by enabling machine intelligent risk-aware ship routing and monitoring of vessel transits by Coastguard agencies.","Maritime risk assessment,Severe weather events,Machine learning,Navigation safety,"
"decade-low aerosol levels over the bohai and yellow seas amid the covid-19 lockdown","2022","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has crucially influenced anthropogenic activities, which in turn impacts upon the environment. In this study, we investigated the variations on aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 550 nm over the Bohai Sea and Yellow Sea during the COVID-19 lockdown (from February to March in 2020) of China mainland based on Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) observation by comparing with historical AOD records (2011–2019). Our results show that with the lockdown implementation, the decade-low AOD levels are achieved in February and March 2020 (0.39 ± 0.18 and 0.37 ± 0.19, respectively), which are 22% and 28% (p < 0.01) lower than the average AOD between 2011 and 2019 (0.50 ± 0.08 and 0.52 ± 0.05, respectively). After the lockdown restrictions were relaxed and industrial production gradually resumed, the AOD in April 2020 rebounded to the historical average level. Besides, compared with historical observations (2011–2019), the AOD temporal variability from February to April 2020 showed different pattern, with the decade-high increase from March to April (+0.11) and decade-low increase from February to March (-0.01). Independent observations and simulation, including fine particulate matter (PM2.5) from ground-based measurements, wind field from Cross-Calibrated Multi-Platform, satellite-derived aerosol type, and back trajectories calculation by Hybird Single Paricle Lagrangian Intergrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model, indicated that the above abnormal AOD variation can be attributed to reduction of anthropogenic emissions during the COVID-19 lockdown period. The results of this paper, therefore, indicate that aerosols over the Bohai and Yellow Seas are strongly influenced by human activities, and the public health events such as the epidemic may alter the intensity of human activities and thus the spatio-temporal pattern of aerosol over ocean. With the global spread of the epidemic and the corresponding significant changes in human behavior patterns (restrictions on human activities, etc.), more studies should be carried out in the future about the aerosol variability and its potential impact on the marine environment.","PM,AOD,Bohai Sea and Yellow Sea,COVID-19,Decade-low,Lockdown,"
"msar-net: a deep learning based classification approach for learning the maritime environment","2022","We develop an end-to-end deep learning-based approach for the classification of complex maritime environments via multichannel synthetic aperture radar (MSAR) sensors.

We evaluate the performance of our technique, called MSAR-Net, using datasets collected by the U.S. Naval Research Laboratoryâ€™s experimental airborne MSAR system. Our results demonstrate that MSAR-Net achieves consistently and substantially superior performance compared to conventional amplitude-based scene classification.

"climate reconstructions for the last glacial maximum from a simple cirque glacier in fiordland, new zealand","2022","Mountain glacier records offer important constraints on the timing and magnitude of climate variability during the last glacial cycle. Existing moraine chronologies from the central Southern Alps indicate maximum ice extent was achieved during marine isotope stages 3–4, followed by repeated advances of similar, but gradually declining extent during marine isotope stage 2, until onset of the glacial termination. Questions remain over the precise role of climate in driving these changes, as most existing moraine chronologies come from large, complex former valley glacier systems, where non-climatic influences such as changing bed topography and proglacial lake formation may have influenced glacier length changes. Here we address this problem via a new cosmogenic 10Be chronology and equilibrium line altitude reconstruction from a cirque glacier situated in Fiordland, New Zealand. Our chronology shows moraine deposition at 32 ± 11 ka, 18.7 ± 0.2 ka, 18.1 ± 0.1 ka, and c. 17.2 ± 0.3 ka. The simple geometry of the former glacier supports the role of climate in driving a net decline of regional ice volume during marine isotope stages 3–2. Close spacing and good preservation of the 19–17 ka moraines permits 2D glacier reconstruction which suggests the equilibrium line altitude remained depressed by c.1130 m (equivalent to 5.8 ± 0.6 °C colder than present) during this interval. Onset of warming after 17.2 ± 0.2 ka is consistent with climate proxy evidence for a sustained southward shift in the southern westerly winds, which may have promoted deglaciation via shifting ocean currents and promoting increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide.","Glaciation,Pleistocene,Quaternary,Geomorphology,Southern pacific,Degree day modelling,Cosmogenic isotopes,Equilibrium line altitude,Paleoclimatology,Glacial,"
"footprint and detectability of a well leaking co2 in the central north sea: implications from a field experiment and numerical modelling","2019","Existing wells pose a risk for the loss of carbon dioxide (CO2) from storage sites, which might compromise the suitability of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) and carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies as climate change mitigation options. Here, we show results of a controlled CO2 release experiment at the Sleipner CO2 storage site and numerical simulations that evaluate the detectability and environmental consequences of a well leaking CO2 into the Central North Sea (CNS). Our field measurements and numerical results demonstrate that the detectability and impact of a leakage of <55 t yr−1 of CO2 would be limited to bottom waters and a small area around the leak, due to rapid CO2 bubble dissolution in seawater within the lower 2 m of the water column and quick dispersion of the dissolved CO2 plume by strong tidal currents. As such, the consequences of a single well leaking CO2 are found to be insignificant in terms of storage performance. Only prolonged leakage along numerous wells might compromise long-term CO2 storage and may adversely affect the local marine ecosystem. Since many abandoned wells leak natural gas into the marine environment, hydrocarbon provinces with a high density of wells may not always be the most suitable areas for CO2 storage.","North Sea,Carbon dioxide,Leakage,Wells,Geological storage,Sleipner,"
"the real-time reliable detection of the horizon line on high-resolution maritime images for unmanned surface-vehicle","2020","Horizon detection is useful in maritime image processing for various purposes, such as spatial orientation estimation of ship camera and detection of the significant region for post-processing. This paper proposed a novel realtime optimization-based method for detecting the horizon line in maritime images. Traditional methods defined the horizon line detection problem aim to detect the horizon line which perfectly divides the whole image into two regions as the sky and sea. Thus, the complication of traditional methods is the statistical distance metrics of distributions are calculated in the whole image by all combinations of the horizon line parameters. Moreover, traditional methods do not provide realtime processing to detect the horizon line from high-resolution images. To achieve real-time processing on high-resolution images, this study defines the local features of the horizon line using a vanishing line characteristic and the optimization criteria. In addition, the optimization process is improved by combining a genetic algorithm and a coarse-to-fine approach. Our method applied the Singapore marine dataset and the Buoy dataset. To verify the proposed method, our result is compared to the state of the art methods.

"an identity-based data integrity auditing scheme for cloud-based maritime transportation systems","2023","With the development of Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled Maritime Transportation Systems (MTS), massive data generated in the system not only requires to be stored reliably and cheaply, but also needs to be analyzed timely. The Cloud-based Maritime Transportation Systems (CMTS) allow users to upload the data without worrying about the price, capacity, location and so on. However, CMTS also brings some security issues, where the integrity protection of outsourced data is one of the most important issues since it is crucial for the safety, reliability and efficiency of sea lanes. To solve this problem, we propose an identity-based dynamic data integrity auditing scheme for CMTS. Our scheme decreases the burden of key management and improves the auditing efficiency by batch auditing. Besides, our scheme also supports dynamic operations on the outsourced data for CMTS. The security analysis shows that our scheme can ensure the feature of storage correctness and resist common attacks. In addition, the performance comparison results with other related schemes show that our scheme not only has the lowest computational cost on all entities, but also greatly reduces the communication overhead of the auditing phase. Therefore, our scheme is very suitable for data integrity verification in CMTS.","dynamic operations,Transportation,data integrity,Public key,outsourced data,Internet of Things,transportation,identity-based integrity auditing,reliability,CMTS,related schemes,Cloud-based Maritime Transportation Systems,Servers,batch auditing,Maritime transportation systems,cloud computing,storage management,massive data,outsourcing,data integrity verification,Data integrity,auditing,cloud storage,identity-based data integrity auditing scheme,Cloud computing,Computational modeling,Things-enabled Maritime Transportation Systems,Security,data integration,auditing efficiency,integrity protection,identity-based dynamic data integrity auditing scheme,"
"comparison of target detectors to identify icebergs in quad- polarimetric sar alos-2 images","2021","Icebergs represent hazards to ships and maritime activities and therefore their detection is essential. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellites are very useful for this, due to their capability to acquire under cloud cover and during polar nights. Additionally, polarimetry has been proven to improve the detection capability. In this work, we compare six state-of-the-art quad polarimetric detectors to test their performance and ability to detect small sized icebergs in four locations in Greenland. These were the polarimetric notch filter (PNF), polarimetric match filter (PMF), polarimetric whitening filter (PWF), optimal polarimetric detector (OPD), reflection symmetry detector, and the dual polarisation anomaly detector (iDPolRAD). We use four single look complex ALOS-2 quad pol images. The data were calibrated and processed. We produce the covariance matrices of each image before applying a testing and training window for detection. We also add a guard window to reduce false alarms.

"eprd: exploiting prior knowledge for evidence-providing automatic rumor detection","2023","With the prevalence of social media platforms, rumors have been a serious social problem. Notably, existing rumor detection methods simply provide detection labels while ignoring their explanation. However, illustrating the reasons why a suspicious statement is a rumor is essential. To address this realistic scenario, we propose a novel Evidence-Providing Rumor Detection model called EPRD. EPRD incorporates a wide variety of information from both prior knowledge sources and current comments. It also learns bilaterally friendly representations for interpretable rumor detection. EPRD first retrieves evidence from prior knowledge sources and checks the relationship between the given statement and its evidence. Our model then constructs two heterogeneous graph objects to simulate the propagation layout of the current comments and evidence relationships. Finally, EPRD integrates the GraphSAGE component and attention mechanism to detect rumors. To the best of our knowledge, we propose the first model that incorporates prior knowledge to verify rumors and boost credibility. Experiments on two real-world Twitter datasets demonstrate that EPRD consistently exhibits the best rumor detection performance. Moreover, EPRD outperforms other baselines in the early rumor detection task.","Deep learning,Graph neural network,Rumor detection,Evidence,Natural language inference,"
"unsupervised maritime vessel re-identification with multi-level contrastive learning","2023","Re-identification (re-ID) of maritime vessels plays an important role in marine surveillance, but remains highly unexplored due to the lack of large-scale annotated datasets. In vessel re-ID, contrastive methods are supposed to learn discriminative representation from unlabeled vessel images in an unsupervised manner. However, directly introducing classical instance-level contrastive methods to maritime vessel re-ID suffers from the difficulty of finding vessel images with the same pseudo label as positive images, which potentially leads to inefficient training and unsatisfactory performance. This paper proposes a simple but effective method to solve such a hard positive problem. Our method takes all images in an intra-batch cluster as positives and excludes them from the set of negative samples when computing instance-level contrastive loss. Based on this strategy, we construct a multi-level contrastive learning (MCL) framework for vessel re-ID trained with the specifically designed intra-batch cluster-level contrastive loss along with the instance-level one. Experiments on a newly proposed dataset consisting of 1,248 vessel identities show that MCL achieves the state-of-the-art performance compared with other unsupervised methods.","object recognition,discriminative representation,unsupervised learning,Cameras,Unsupervised learning,Vessel re-identification,instance-level contrastive loss,contrastive learning,intra-batch cluster-level contrastive loss,image representation,MCL,Intelligent transportation systems,unsupervised maritime vessel re-identification,pattern clustering,multilevel contrastive learning,maritime vessel re-ID,vessel identities,Training,large-scale annotated datasets,Representation learning,positive images,unlabeled vessel images,Surveillance,Task analysis,marine surveillance,"

"path orthogonal matching pursuit for sparse reconstruction and denoising of swir maritime imagery","2018","We introduce an extension that may be used to augment algorithms used for the sparse decomposition of signals into a linear combination of atoms drawn from a dictionary such as those used in support of, for example, compressive sensing, k-sparse representation, and denoising. Our augmentation may be applied to any reconstruction algorithm that relies on the selection and sorting of high-correlation atoms during an analysis or identification phase by generating a 'path' between the two highest-correlation atoms. Here we investigate two types of path: a linear combination (Euclidean geodesic) and a construction relying on an optimal transport map (2-Wasserstein geodesic). We test our extension by performing image denoising and k-sparse representation using atoms from a learned overcomplete kSVD dictionary. We study the application of our techniques on SWIR imagery of maritime vessels and show that our methods outperform orthogonal matching pursuit.

"random finite set tracking for anomaly detection in the presence of clutter","2020","In this paper, a sequential Bayesian framework is proposed to address the task of joint anomaly detection and tracking for surveillance applications in the presence of clutter. This is achieved by modeling the anomaly as a switching unknown control input which goes into action by modifying the expected dynamics of a target and ceases its activity (becomes nonexistent) under nominal behavior. Random Finite Sets (RFS) make it possible to represent the switching nature of the object anomalous behavior and derive a hybrid Bernoulli filter (HBF) that sequentially updates the joint posterior density of a Bernoulli RFS for the unknown velocity input and the object kinematic state. In addition, the proposed HBF has been customized for maritime anomaly detection by using a piecewise Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) stochastic process as dynamic model of vessels.

"spatio-temporal reconstruction of snow avalanche activity using dendrogeomorphological approach in bucegi mountains romanian carpathians","2014","Snow avalanches cause damage to tourism infrastructure and loss of human life. In mountain areas where snow avalanches are less scientifically documented, the dendrogeomorphological approach is the best way for snow–avalanche activity reconstruction and to investigate the magnitude and frequency of the avalanches. Our study was conducted in the Bucegi Mountains located in the eastern part of the Southern Carpathians (Romanian Carpathians) in the Sinaia ski area, the most important ski area in the Romanian Carpathians. The mountains are characterised by high elevations of over 2400–2500m, a harsh climate (−2.5°C mean annual air temperature above 2500masl, over 130days with snowfall on average, over 185days with deep snow on average and 10–12months with a snow layer). Snow avalanche activity is marked by tilted trunks, scars and broken trees. Therefore, we applied the dendrogeomorphological approach. We performed a dendrogeomorphic analysis based on 66 Picea abies and 48 Larix decidua Mill. We sampled trees in two snow avalanche tracks, 43 in one and 71 in the other, and obtained 86 and 142 samples, respectively. Our results from tree-ring records yielded 32 snow avalanche winters in the 1963–2011 chronology in one track and 27 snow avalanche winters in the 1963–2012 chronology in the other track. Thus, we obtained important information about the spatial and temporal characteristics of snow avalanche activity. The small and medium snow avalanches cover the central and lateral parts of the stands, whilst the large snow avalanches reach the runout zone of the stands. We dated past snow avalanches and obtained a return period ranging from 13.7 to 15.2years. The analysis revealed that 14 winters had an activity index over 10% 4 winters had an activity index over 20% in the first avalanche track, 10 winters had an activity index over 10% and 4 winters had an activity index over 20% in the second avalanche track. On the other hand, to determine the relationship between snow avalanches and winter temperatures we use the Winter Standardized Index (WSI) between 1963 and 2012. We obtained a correlation between these parameters and our dendrogeomorphological results; the probability of major snow avalanche occurrence was highest during cold winters.","Norway spruce (),European larch ( Mill.),Dendrogeomorphological approach,Bucegi Mountains,Romanian Carpathians,Snow avalanche,"
"vegetation and climate change, fire-regime shifts and volcanic disturbance in chiloé continental (43°s) during the last 10,000 years","2015","Disentangling the roles of paleofires and explosive volcanism from climatic drivers of past vegetation change is a subject insufficiently addressed in the paleoecological literature. The coastal region of the Chiloé Continental sector of northwestern Patagonia is ideal in this regard considering its proximity to active eruptive centers and the possibility of establishing comparisons with more distal, upwind sites where volcanic influence is minimal. Here we present a fine-resolution pollen and macroscopic charcoal record from Lago Teo with the aim of documenting the local vegetation and climate history, and assessing the role of disturbance regimes as drivers of vegetation change during the last ∼10,000 years. The Lago Teo record shows a conspicuous warm/dry interval between ∼7500 and 10,000 cal yrs BP followed by a cooling trend and increase in precipitation that has persisted until the present, in agreement with previous studies in the region and interpretations of past southern westerly wind activity at multi-millennial scales. The presence of 26 tephras throughout the record allows examination of the relationship between explosive volcanism and vegetation change under contrasting climatic states of the Holocene. We found consistent statistically significant increases in Tepualia stipularis after tephra deposition over the last 10,000 years, in Eucryphia/Caldcluvia between 7500 and 10,000 cal yrs BP and in Hydrangea over the last 7500 years.

"eeg-based maritime object detection for iot-driven surveillance systems in smart ocean","2020","Automated maritime object detection is a significant research challenge in intelligent marine surveillance systems for the Internet of Things (IoT) and smart ocean applications. In particular, ship detection is recognized as one of the core research issues of these IoT-driven intelligent marine surveillance systems. Traditional methods based on machine learning have made some achievements in detection tasks for specific objects. However, the ship objects are relatively small, and they are usually not accurately detected. In this article, we propose an electroencephalography (EEG)-based maritime object detection algorithm for IoT-driven surveillance systems in the smart ocean. For this purpose, we conduct experiments to record the EEG signals of subjects when they are watching the maritime image scenes. With the feature analysis of EEG signals, the event-related potential (ERP) components associated with detecting objects are induced, such as the  $P3$  and  $N2$  components. Employing classification based on linear discriminant analysis (LDA), the area under curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) is used to evaluate the detection accuracy. We use this novel method to determine and identify essential objects and areas from IoT devices, such as digital camera imaging sensors.

"vc-gan: classifying vessel types by maritime trajectories using generative adversarial networks","2020","As maritime transport is the backbone of global trade, it is important to ensure the safety and security for sea transportation effectively. However, the dependence on experienced human operators for maritime surveillance does not scale in terms of coverage. While the ship information and trajectory data from the Automatic Identification System (AIS) can be used to automate maritime surveillance, the AIS data may be modified deliberately or accidentally, resulting in difficulties in the detection of illegal maritime activities. We have developed VC-GAN for Vessel Classification using Generative Adversarial Networks to identify vessel types based solely on the vessel trajectories in areas of interest. Our VC-GAN framework adversarially trains a multi-class classifier by learning from the labelled AIS data to classify the types of the vessels of interest, as well as to detect the out-of-class vessels.

"design of provably secure authentication protocol for edge-centric maritime transportation system","2023","The epidemic growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) objects have revolutionized Maritime Transportation Systems (MTS). Though, it becomes challenging for the centralized cloud-centric framework to fulfil the application requirements such as low latency and power utilization. The introduction of the distributed edge-centric framework has recently helped the IoT-enabled MTS to meet these requirements by manipulating the tasks at the edge of the networks. Despite the fact that MTS leverages mobile subscribers by overcoming inherent cloud computing limitations, data security and user privacy requirements in establishing the MTS setup are still non-trivial challenges. In this article, we develop a key agreement solution for mobile users to realize mutual authentication in a single round. Our protocol offers user anonymity to maintain user privacy, and it can prevent physical attacks by physically unclonable functions. Initially, the security analysis is conferred to substantiate our protocolâ€™s security persistence or strength. Later, its performance correlation is observed under the assumption of diverse metrics in a predefined empirical setup. The meticulous performance correlation endorses the precedence of our protocol over specified related protocols.","authentication protocol,Hash functions,mobile edge computing,Servers,authentication,Cloud computing,Protocols,Authentication,Internet of Things,Security,Mutual authentication,"
"the promises and perils of automatic identification system data","2021","Automatic Identification System (AIS) is used to identify vessels in maritime navigation. Currently, it is used for various commercial purposes. However, the abundance and lack of quality of AIS data make it difficult to capitalize on its value. Therefore, an understanding of both the limitations of AIS data and the opportunities is important to maximize its value, but these have not been clearly stated in the existing literature. This study aims to help researchers and practitioners understand AIS data by identifying both the promises and perils of AIS data. We identify the different applications and limitations of AIS data in the literature and build upon them in a sequential mixed-design study. We first identify the promises and perils that exist in the literature. We then analyze AIS data from the port of Amsterdam quantitatively to detect noise and to find the perils researchers and practitioners could encounter. Our results incorporate quantitative findings with qualitative insights obtained from interviewing domain experts. This study extends the literature by considering multiple limitations of AIS data across different domains at the same time. Our results show that the amount of noise in AIS data depends on factors such as the equipment used, external factors, humans, dense traffic etc. The contribution that our paper makes is in combining and making a comprehensive list of both the promises and perils of AIS data. Consequently, this study helps researchers and practitioners to (i) identify the sources of noise, (ii) to reduce the noise in AIS data and (iii) use it for the benefits of their research or the optimization of their operations.","Ship behavior analysis,Advanced applications of AIS data,Navigation safety,Environmental evaluation,Data mining,AIS data,"
"a bayesian iterative geomagnetic model with universal data input: self-consistent spherical harmonic evolution for the geomagnetic field over the last 4000 years","2019","Changes of the Earth's magnetic field have been observed with varying spatial and temporal resolution since the middle ages by means of compasses, and later by refined mechanical inclination and intensity instruments, until the modern use of quantum mechanical devices and satellite observations. Ancient records, on the other hand, rely on the natural magnetization of archaeological artifacts and other materials, such as rocks and sediments, being therefore indirect, less accurate and sparser. The combination of such heterogeneous records into a single, self-consistent, global model of the geomagnetic field is very challenging: the highly uneven data coverage, both in space and time, requires a careful handling of data uncertainties and error correlations. Previous models dealt with this problem using separated treatments of instrumental data and indirect records, respectively, as well as a different handling of the dipole field component, with respect to non-dipole terms. Here we present a global geomagnetic field model based, for the first time, on the simultaneous inversion of historical, archaeomagnetic, and volcanic records, using a Bayesian approach with minimal-committing time regularization that minimizes the energy of secular variation. A detailed assessment of data uncertainty and error correlation is used to minimize artifacts generated by the appearance of an overwhelming number of incomplete, mostly declination-only records, associated with shipboard measurements in the early colonial period. Our model yields lower dipole energies, which better match modern values, as well as higher non-dipole energies and a stronger secular variation of the dipole moment. Some model artifacts associated with extremely heterogeneous distributions of records in time and space are not completely eliminable and might be caused by incorrect a-priori uncertainty assessments. Alternatively, they might represent an intrinsic limit that can be overcome only by adding new records at critical locations and times.","Geomagnetism,Field modeling,Historical records,Secular variation,Archaeomagnetism,"
"prediction of rendezvous in maritime situational awareness","2018","In this work, we consider the problem of algorithmically predicting rendezvous among vessels based on their trajectory forecasts in a maritime environment. The problem is treated as hypothesis testing on the expected value of the distance between trajectories. We relate this quantity to the first and second degree Wasserstein distances between trajectory forecast distributions. These distributions are obtained using integrated Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process models with the trajectory measurements collected so far. Building upon these results, we propose an algorithm which traverses the trajectories observed so far for detecting rendezvous over a rolling time horizon. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm using simulations.","Wasserstein distances,predictive models,Prediction algorithms,situation awareness,hypothesis testing,Integrated Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process,Stochastic processes,Predictive models,stochastic processes,trajectory measurements,integrated Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process models,Forecasting,Wasserstein distance,Trajectory,probability,Uncertainty,mean reverting process,trajectory forecast distributions,knowledge discovery,"
"modeling of interferences on other satellites in maritime satellite communications","2013","In maritime mobile satellite communications, mechanically controlled tracking systems are used to compensate changes of antenna orientation due to changes of a ship attitude caused by waves or winds of the sea. Orientations of antennas on a ship are limited so that transmitted electromagnetic waves are not affected by structures on the ship. Thus it is allowed to transmit waves when a clearance angle is greater than certain criteria. Our group has researched about fundamental relation between clearance angles and interferences for other satellites or other systems on the ship by numerical simulations for a simplified model. In this report, a realistic ship model is assumed for the simulations. As a result, a clearance angle, which interferences to the receiving satellite are small, has been found out under the conditions of the simulations. A simple model which describes interferences to received levels of the aiming and neighboring satellites is presented.","Satellites,interference model,maritime,satellite receiving,electromagnetic wave transmission,Marine vehicles,Satellite antennas,Bridges,antenna orientation,interference,Transmitting antennas,Satellite communications,ship structures,numerical simulations,mobile radio,reception level,radiofrequency interference,mobile antennas,tracking systems,ship attitude,Receiving antennas,ship antenna,marine communication,maritime mobile satellite communications,diffracted wave,numerical analysis,"
"a visual analytics process for maritime resource allocation and risk assessment","2011","In this paper, we present our collaborative work with the U.S. Coast Guard's Ninth District and Atlantic Area Commands where we developed a visual analytics system to analyze historic response operations and assess the potential risks in the maritime environment associated with the hypothetical allocation of Coast Guard resources. The system includes linked views and interactive displays that enable the analysis of trends, patterns and anomalies among the U.S. Coast Guard search and rescue (SAR) operations and their associated sorties. Our system allows users to determine the potential change in risks associated with closing certain stations in terms of response time, potential lives and property lost and provides optimal direction as to the nearest available station. We provide maritime risk assessment tools that allow analysts to explore Coast Guard coverage for SAR operations and identify regions of high risk. The system also enables a thorough assessment of all SAR operations conducted by each Coast Guard station in the Great Lakes region.

"sparse multi-channel synthetic aperture radar based motion induced distortion correction and classification of maritime scenes","2021","Multi-channel Synthetic Aperture Radar (MSAR) in the maritime environment has proven to be an effective technique for improved image fidelity and scene characterization. Past demonstrations of MSAR-based methods for improvements such as motion induced distortion correction and image classification were performed using a uniformly spaced array of phase centers. In this paper, we derive novel extensions of these techniques to the case of sparse and non-uniformly spaced phase center configurations and demonstrate their effectiveness for a variety of platforms and sensor arrangements. We establish general techniques for correcting motion induced distortions, establish theoretical bounds of performance, and empirically validate our techniques on data derived from our airborne MSAR system. We then use these images to characterize the structure of the maritime scene using our MSAR-based classification technique. Our imaging and classification techniques are amenable to efficient implementation on diverse hardware platforms and sensor arrangements, and thus can find ready application in practical multichannel radar systems.","Phased arrays,image classification,Synthetic aperture radar,Radar imaging,Classification algorithms,Multi-channel synthetic aperture radar (SAR),Imaging,Radar polarimetry,Arrays,ocean imaging,"
"data gap analysis of ship and maritime data using meta learning","2021","With the developments in new Internet of Things (IoT) technology, ship owners and managers can access and analyze vast amounts of real-time onboard data. However, data collected from the ship’s engine and navigation information include various types of errors owing to imprecision, bias, sensor failure, or human error caused by manual recording by the ship operator’s hands. Such abnormal data make accurate ship performance prediction and monitoring difficult; thus, the original data need to be carefully refined through data preprocessing. Machine learning models have been used to detect and remove abnormal data; however, this yields inconsistent predictions in results depending on the types of machine learning models used. In this study, a robust data gap analysis method is proposed to detect abnormal data among ship and marine data collected in real time. Data preprocessing, including rule-based data imputation, clustering, denoising, and dimension reduction, is systematically performed; subsequently, a meta-learning model, which is a combination of various machine learning models, is used to predict ship performance and detect its abnormal data. This study compared the performance of single-machine learning models and meta models through various error analysis methods that utilize actual ship operation data. The single machine leading models have various error values depending on types of data and models, while the meta model consistently has values of less than 5% of mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and relative root-mean-square error (RRMSE), showing a Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient(NSE) value of 0.7 or higher. Our proposed data gap analysis framework, including the meta-learning model, can be useful for monitoring the condition of ships, as it can more accurately and robustly classify them as normal or abnormal.","Data preprocessing,Machine learning error measures,Meta learning,Data gap analysis,"
"synergistic abiotic and biotic stressors explain widespread decline of pinus pinaster in a mixed forest","2019","Global change potentially increases forest vulnerability. Different abiotic and biotic factors may interact to cause forest decline and accelerated tree mortality. We studied a mixed Mediterranean continental forest where Pinus pinaster Ait. (maritime pine) shows widespread decline to analyse the role of different abiotic and biotic factors on health status and growth dynamics both at the individual and plot levels. We also analysed stand composition and regeneration of tree species to check whether there is a change in species dominance. Fungal pathogens were seldom present and we detected no pervasive fungi or insect infestation and no presence of pathogens like Heterobasidion or Phytophthora. Infection of hemiparasite plants like Viscum album L. (mistletoe) can reduce leaf area and its abundance is generally considered an expression of host decline. Yet, the existence among declining trees of high defoliation levels without mistletoe, but not vice versa, suggests that defoliation in response to some abiotic stressor could be a predisposing factor preceding mistletoe infection. Compared to healthy trees, declining and dead trees exhibited higher defoliation rates, smaller needles and lower recent growth with steeper negative trends. Dead and declining trees showed similar negative growth trends since the early 1990s droughts, which we interpreted as early warning signals anticipating mortality of currently declining trees in the near future. Mortality of maritime pine extending across all size classes, the lower presence of this species in the smallest size classes and its lack of regeneration suggest it is potentially losing its current dominance and being replaced by other co-occurring, more drought-tolerant species. Our results unravelled that maritime pine decline seems to be mainly driven by a combination of predisposing and inciting abiotic factors (microenvironment and drought stress) and biotic factors (mistletoe). The absence of widespread fungal pathogens suggests that they may have a minor role on pine decline acting only eventually as contributing factors. Although there could be other interrelations among factors or other biotic agents at play, our results strongly suggest that water stress plays a major role in the decline process of the dominant species on an ecosystem with strong land-use legacies.","Abiotic stress,Mistletoe,Defoliation,Drought,Land-use,Fungal pathogens,"

"ocean oil spill detection from sar images based on multi-channel deep learning semantic segmentation","2023","One of the major threats to marine ecosystems is pollution, particularly, that associated with the offshore oil and gas industry. Oil spills occur in the world's oceans every day, either as large-scale spews from drilling-rig or tanker accidents, or as smaller discharges from all sorts of sea-going vessels. In order to contribute to the timely detection and monitoring of oil spills over the oceans, we propose a new Multi-channel Deep Neural Network (M-DNN) segmentation model and a new and effective Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) image dataset, that enable us to emit forewarnings in a prompt and reliable manner. Our proposed M-DNN is a pixel-level segmentation model intended to improve previous DNN oil-spill detection models, by taking into account multiple input channels, complex oil shapes at different scales (dimensions) and evolution in time, and look-alikes from low wind speed conditions. Our methodology consists of the following components: 1) New Multi-channel SAR Image Database Development; 2) Multi-Channel DNN Model based on U-net and ResNet; and 3) Multi-channel DNN Training and Transfer Learning. Due to the lack of public oil spill databases guaranteeing a correct learning process of the M-DNN, we developed our own database consisting of 16 ENVISAT-ASAR images acquired over the Gulf of Mexico during the Deepwater Horizon (DWH) blowout, off the west coast of South Korea during the Hebei Spirit oil tanker collision, and over the Black Sea.

"keeping the baddies out and the bridge calm: embedded authentication for maritime networks","2022","Integrated bridges of todayâ€™s vessels are complex and distributed maritime systems that interconnect versatile electronic equipment. However, digitized vessels have long ceased to be isolated systems and are thus increasingly vulnerable to cyber attacks. In this context, integrity and authentication of the communication onboard is crucial. Therefore, we introduce MARMAC, a low-cost solution to retrofit authentication of nautical communication. MARMAC is based on symmetric cryptography and extends the prevalent IEC61162-450 protocol enabling a backward-compatible solution which mitigates common attacks. Using a specific gatekeeper approach, MARMAC can prevent unauthenticated messages from being processed that could otherwise affect the nautical situational awareness on the bridge.

"nmtlat: a new robust mobile multi-target localization and tracking scheme in marine search and rescue wireless sensor networks under byzantine attack","2020","After a shipwreck (ship collision, explosion, disappearance, etc.), people rely on the marine search and rescue wireless sensor networks (MSR-WSNs) as one key weapon to locate and track drowning targets to save lives and assets. However, due to the complex and dynamic ocean environment, marine sensors could be captured by malicious attackers and then become Byzantine sensors. Byzantine sensors may tamper with the actual sensor data at a fixed or time-varying probability and transmit it to the data fusion center (DFC), which renders the normal localization and tracking function of the search and rescue system downgrade or even fail. To address this issue, we develop a New robust marine mobile Multi-Target LocAlization and Tracking scheme called NMTLAT by eliminating abnormal measurement data from the initial measurement data. NMTLAT works in several steps. By analyzing and mining sensors data and behavior, we firstly employ the information entropy of the system composed of a single sensor and their neighbor sensors to develop an efficient dynamic threshold based Byzantine node identification method. After migrating Byzantine sensors, the DFC utilizes sensor-aware and preprocessed marine data of the beacon or honest sensors to complete target localization and trajectory tracking. Specifically, NMTLAT consists of a novel distributed and cooperative multi-target localization and tracking algorithm using both received signal strength indication (RSSI) and priori information of sensors location. NMTLAT employs the importance sampling method to approximate the posterior probability distribution of the sensors and targets location. Furthermore, when the marine target is outside MSR-WSNs coverage, a piecewise function is utilized to characterize the likelihood of finding a drowning target in the search and rescue sea area. Finally, the Lyapunov’s second stability theorem is adopted to measure the stability of the NMTLAT. Our extensive simulation experiments validate that the NMTLAT performance is superior to existing solutions in various marine search and rescue scenarios.","Importance sampling,Lyapunov’s stability theorem,Information entropy,Maritime search and rescue wireless sensor networks,Cooperative localization and tracking,Byzantine sensor identification,"

"compound-specific d/h ratios of the marine lakes of palau as proxies for west pacific warm pool hydrologic variability","2011","We tested the use of hydrogen isotopic ratios (δD) of lipids in marine lake sediments from the Micronesian Republic of Palau against the instrumental record of the last century to assess their capacity to record past hydrological changes of the Western Pacific Warm Pool. δD values of the algal lipid biomarker dinosterol (δDDino) and the more generic palmitic acid (δDPA) were found to be sensitive indicators of the intensity of regional precipitation, as recorded by the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI). The observed sensitivity is caused by the combined effect of: 1) The amount effect in tropical precipitation; 2) Dilution of the isotopically heavy saline surface waters with light precipitation; 3) A salinity effect on the biosynthetic D/H fractionation between lipid and lake water. Both lake water δD (δDLake) and δDDino could be expressed as a quadratic function of either precipitation or lake water salinity. δDDino values were used to reconstruct past hydrological changes of the region. Long-term variations in the strength and sign of the El Niño - Southern Oscillation (ENSO) since the Little Ice Age (LIA, ∼1450–1850 A.D.) and during the early Holocene (∼7–9 kyr BP) appeared to dominate decadal variability, and indicate very dry conditions during the LIA. Early Holocene δDDino values were on average ∼10‰ higher than those of recent centuries, which we interpret as a result of millennial scale hydrologic and water mass changes on a global level. The similar ∼35‰ range of δD changes during the early Holocene and last several centuries imply a similar range of decadal-centennial hydrologic variability during those two climate regimes. Our results indicate that a correlation exists between solar irradiance levels and tropical Pacific climate.","West Pacific Warm Pool,Marine lakes,Hydroclimate,Hydrogen isotopes,Paleoclimate,Biomarkers,Palau,"
"novel maritime channel models for millimeter radiowaves","2016","This work presents and analyzes the results of millimeter-wave propagation simulations performed for over the sea LoS ship to ship communication channels. We present a channel characterization study where channel parameters such as path loss, received power, RMS delay spread, and power delay profile are obtained by using a ray tracing approach. 5G candidate frequencies, 35 GHz and 94 GHz were chosen as the primary bands of interest since these two bands have minimum water and oxygen attenuation, thereby promising better performance among the other frequency bands. Our results indicate that 2-ray analytical propagation loss model should only be used for short ranges over the sea surface propagation at typical frequencies considered by 5G. However, free space path loss model cannot predict the behavior of channel over the sea surface in high frequencies even for short ranges. Therefore, in this study a new model that is the modified version of 2-ray path loss model is proposed, in which a coefficient in the power of exponential function is introduced to better predict the behavior of maritime channels of 5G.

"maritime border security using sensors, processing, and platforms to detect dark vessels","2018","Maritime security is critical to national prosperity, but with a large area to be secured and limited resources available, our current maritime situational awareness is not sufficient to secure our borders.

New solutions are required to detect these â€œdarkâ€ vessels in the expansive maritime domain and thereby enable increased maritime situational awareness and security.

"maritime situation analysis framework: vessel interaction classification and anomaly detection","2015","Maritime domain awareness is critical for protecting sea lanes, ports, harbors, offshore structures like oil and gas rigs and other types of critical infrastructure against common threats and illegal activities.

Limited surveillance resources constrain maritime domain awareness and compromise full security coverage at all times. This situation calls for innovative intelligent systems for interactive situation analysis to assist marine authorities and security personal in their routine surveillance operations. In this article, we propose a novel situation analysis approach to analyze marine traffic data and differentiate various scenarios of vessel engagement for the purpose of detecting anomalies of interest for marine vessels that operate over some period of time in relative proximity to each other. We consider such scenarios as probabilistic processes and analyze complex vessel trajectories using machine learning to model common patterns.

"influence of climate variability on anchovy reproductive timing off northern chile","2016","We investigated the relationship between environmental variables and the Gonadosomatic Monthly Mean (GMM) index of anchovy (Engraulis ringens) to understand how the environment affects the dynamics of anchovy reproductive timing. The data examined corresponds to biological information collected from samples of the landings off northern Chile (18°21′S, 24°00′S) during the period 1990–2010. We used the Humboldt Current Index (HCI) and the Multivariate ENSO Index (MEI), which combine several physical-oceanographic factors in the Tropical and South Pacific regions. Using the GMM index, we studied the dynamics of anchovy reproductive timing at different intervals of length, specifically females with a length between 11.5 and 14cm (medium class) and longer than 14cm (large class). Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Mobile Average (SARIMA) was used to predict missing observations. The trends of the environment and reproductive indexes were explored via the Breaks For Additive Season and Trend (BFAST) statistical technique and the relationship between these indexes via cross-correlation functions (CCF) analysis. Our results showed that the habitat of anchovy switched from cool to warm condition, which also influenced gonad development. This was revealed by two and three significant changes (breaks) in the trend of the HCI and MEI indexes, and two significant breaks in the GMM of each time series of anchovy females (medium and large). Negative cross-correlation between the MEI index and GMM of medium and large class females was found, indicating that as the environment gets warmer (positive value of MEI) a decrease in the reproductive activity of anchovy can be expected. Correlation between the MEI index and larger females was stronger than with medium females. Additionally, our results indicate that the GMM index of anchovy for both length classes reaches two maximums per year; the first from August to September and the second from December to January. The intensity (maximum GMM values at rise point) of reproductive activity was not equal though, with the August–September peak being the highest. We also discuss how the synchronicity between environment and reproductive timing, the negative correlation found between MEI and GMM indexes, and the two increases per year of anchovy GMM relate to previous studies. Based on these findings we propose ways to advance in the understanding of how anchovy synchronize gonad development with the environment.","Length,Reproduction,Anchovy,Environment,Northern Chile,Humboldt Current System,"
"similarity grouping-guided neural network modeling for maritime time series prediction","2019","Reliable and accurate prediction of time series plays a crucial role in the maritime industry, such as economic investment, transportation planning, port planning, design, and so on. The dynamic growth of maritime time series has the predominantly complex, and nonlinear and non-stationary properties. To guarantee high-quality prediction performance, we propose to first adopt the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and ensemble EMD (EEMD) methods to decompose the original time series into high- and low-frequency components. The low-frequency components can be easily predicted directly through traditional neural network (NN) methods. It is more difficult to predict high-frequency components due to their properties of weak mathematical regularity. To take advantage of the inherent self-similarities within high-frequency components, these components will be divided into several continuous small (overlapping) segments. The grouped segments with high similarities are then selected to form more proper training datasets for traditional NN methods. This regrouping strategy can assist in enhancing the prediction accuracy of high-frequency components.

"a real-time scene parsing network for autonomous maritime transportation","2023","On the sea, scene parsing, one of the most basic environmental perception methods for autonomous tasks, helps autonomous devices safely navigate and avoid obstacles. However, most of the existing methods lack real-time performance and have difficulty accurately detecting small obstacles and changeable textures. We, therefore, propose a real-time scene-parsing network for autonomous maritime transportation. Specifically, we first design a lightweight model framework and then explore three efficient loss functions, such that a balance between accuracy and real-time performance can be achieved. The first loss function is an obstacle-weighted loss, which improves the extraction of small obstacles by analyzing the distribution law of obstacles at sea. The second one is a detail loss, which optimizes the detail segmentation at complex contours by emphasizing edge features. The last one is an affinity loss, utilizing the context dependency between features to accurately detect reflections, ripples, and other changeable textures. In addition, a new maritime sense-parsing dataset called Greater Bay Area (GBA) dataset is proposed and made publicly available. We tested the proposed model on the GBA dataset and MaSTr1325 dataset, and the experimental results show that the proposed method achieves superior performance in both segmentation and speed, with mean intersection over union (mIOU) of 94.59% and an FPS of 39.44.","Decoding,autonomous tasks,autonomous devices,affinity loss,deep learning (artificial intelligence),obstacle-weighted loss,Greater Bay Area (GBA) dataset,real-time,maritime scene parsing,robot vision,marine navigation,Feature extraction,real-time scene-parsing network,Meteorology,basic environmental perception methods,object detection,feature extraction,efficient loss functions,real-time scene parsing network,neural net architecture,maritime sense-parsing dataset,Real-time systems,detail loss,Context prior (CP),obstacle weighted loss,autonomous maritime transportation,Training,loss function,unmanned surface vehicles,mobile robots,real-time performance,Navigation,Task analysis,image segmentation,collision avoidance,changeable textures,"
"joint stochastic prediction of vessel kinematics and destination based on a maritime traffic graph","2022","Maritime traffic increases every year, and therefore also the amount of traffic data from the Automatic Identification System (AIS). Utilizing these data on traffic patterns and possible destinations for long-term vessel prediction is here an important way of gaining maritime situational awareness (MSA) for use in the decision making in autonomous ships, such as collision avoidance algorithms, which can reduce collision risk during voyage. In this article, we present a destination inference method based on piece-wise Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) processes for predicting vessel motions along common traffic lanes toward a set of destinations. The mean velocities of the processes are inferred through the creation of a maritime graph that represents the major traffic patterns in the area of consideration. After using an OU process for prediction along major sea lanes, the Equilibrium Reverting Velocity (ERV) bridging model is used to enable convergence of the prediction towards considered destinations. Then, based on the OU process and ERV bridging model for prediction, Bayesian inference is used to estimate the posterior destination distribution. Tested on a real-time AIS dataset, the method is shown to perform better than current state-of-the art methods in destination inference as it indirectly takes land and passed destinations into account.","Traffic control,mean velocities,Prediction algorithms,vessel kinematics,Bayes methods,equilibrium reverting velocity bridging model,Destination inference,traffic patterns,posterior destination distribution,Stochastic processes,Predictive models,traffic lanes,sea lanes,maritime situational awareness,long-term vessel prediction,piece-wise Ornstein-Uhlenbeck,Mechatronics,ships,marine safety,automatic identification system,marine engineering,stochastic processes,joint stochastic prediction,collision risk,maritime graph,real-time AIS dataset,maritime graphs,traffic data,Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes,vessel motions,maritime traffic graph,decision making,collision avoidance algorithms,Bayesian inference,Real-time systems,graph theory,ERV bridging model,telecommunication traffic,inference mechanisms,traffic engineering computing,Navigation,collision avoidance,OU process,AIS data,destination inference method,autonomous ships,"
"the usefulness of artificial intelligence for safety assessment of different transport modes","2023","Recent research in transport safety focuses on the processing of large amounts of available data by means of intelligent systems, in order to decrease the number of accidents for transportation users. Several Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications have been developed to address safety problems and improve efficiency of transportation systems. However exchange of knowledge between transport modes has been limited. This paper reviews the ML and AI methods used in different transport modes (road, rail, maritime and aviation) to address safety problems, in order to identify good practices and experiences that can be transferable between transport modes. The methods examined include statistical and econometric methods, algorithmic approaches, classification and clustering methods, artificial neural networks (ANN) as well as optimization and dimension reduction techniques. Our research reveals the increasing interest of transportation researchers and practitioners in AI applications for crash prediction, incident/failure detection, pattern identification, driver/operator or route assistance, as well as optimization problems. The most popular and efficient methods used in all transport modes are ANN, SVM, Hidden Markov Models and Bayesian models. The type of the analytical technique is mainly driven by the purpose of the safety analysis performed. Finally, a wider variety of AI and ML methodologies is observed in road transport mode, which also appears to concentrate a higher, and constantly increasing, number of studies compared to the other modes.","Machine Learning,Transportation Modes,Transportation Safety,Artificial Intelligence,"

We generate a 24Ã—69 Lasso optimal supersaturated design, illustrate its potential with a numerical evaluation, and apply it to an agent-based simulation of maritime escort operations in the Strait of Gibraltar. This application is part of a larger project that seeks to leverage simulation models during the ship design process, and so construct ships that are both cost effective and operationally effective.

"aerial reconfigurable intelligent surface assisted maritime wireless communications","2022","Millimeter wave (mmWave) technology is capable of enhancing the capacity of maritime wireless systems. However, mountains and high-rise buildings impose high-frequency signal blockage, which limits its practical implementation in these environments. In order to mitigate the blockage problems of signal propagations caused by onshore mountains and mountainous near-shore islands, we first propose an aerial reconfigurable intelligent surface (ARIS) assisted maritime wireless communications system, where an ARIS is employed to provide wireless services for maritime users (MUs) that are within the blocked offshore areas. Then, a channel estimation protocol is proposed for our ARIS-assisted maritime wireless communications system, where an offline channel estimation scheme is conceived for estimating the channel between the onShore base station (S-BS) and ARIS, whilst an online channel estimation scheme is designed for obtaining estimates of the ARIS-MUs channel. Based on the channel estimates obtained, an iterative algorithm is provided for obtaining the optimized reflection elements of the ARIS for maximizing the achievable rate of the proposed system.

"dns rebinding threat modeling and security analysis for local area network of maritime transportation systems","2023","Maritime ships and ports have become increasingly digital and intelligent. While intelligent maritime transportation systems bring convenience to the maritime industry, ship operation and management are also confronted with network risks. The Internet of Things (IoT) installed in the shipborne network collects and monitors the environmental data of the whole ship. It uses the collected data to make decisions to control the ship. The threat of Local Area Network (LAN) of IoT in ships has become an emerging issue. The DNS rebinding attack is a typical attack, which can bypass firewalls and seriously threaten the marine network in security and privacy of the local IoT. DNS rebinding attacks are difficult to model and detect, due to their sophisticated characteristics. In this work, we define threat models of DNS rebinding attacks and propose an effective method for the detection of and the defense against these attacks. First, we define threat models for DNS rebinding attacks. We employ a Markov chain to model the process of DNS rebinding attacks. With the threat modeling, the attack behaviors are clearly characterized and the most relevant attributes are thus extracted. Second, we propose an effective method for the detection of DNS rebinding attacks in the marine transportation system. The detection method includes the initialization method and the verification method, which manages and verifies access permission of equipment information and the service interface of the IoT in the shipborn network. Finally, we simulate the DNS rebinding attacks on the marine IoT. We analyze and test the security and the performance of the initialization method and the verification method in the simulated environment. The extensive experimental results demonstrate that the IoT in marine networks is vulnerable to DNS rebinding. Our method is effective and efficient to detect and defend against DNS rebinding attacks. It thus secures security and privacy in the local IoT on shipboard.","Markov processes,threat models,computer network security,DNS rebinding,marine transportation system,IoT,detection method,attack behaviors,Internet of Things,TTL,Marine vehicles,transportation,maritime ships,shipborne network,security of data,marine network,local IoT,network risks,ships,Servers,marine safety,marine engineering,maritime transportation,Local area networks,DNS rebinding attack,typical attack,DNs rebinding threat modeling,Computer crime,shipborn network,verification method,marine IoT,ship operation,intelligent maritime transportation systems,initialization method,Sensors,local area network,maritime industry,Internet,Security,authorisation,data privacy,threat detection,"
"enhancing capacity of maritime broadband communication systems","2016","In this paper we motivate the need for a broadband wireless link over sea. Besides higher data rate, shorter latency and high reliability of the communication link will have a substantial impact on the success of telematic applications. For example hybrid ships need a continuous control of their batteries. Autonomous ships require a ultra-reliable and a high data throughout of the wireless channel to report the relevant telematic information to the off-shore control station.

"the international safety framework for nuclear power source applications in outer space—useful and substantial guidance","2015","In 2009, the International Safety Framework for Nuclear Power Source Applications in Outer Space was adopted, following a multi-year process that involved all major space faring nations under the auspices of a partnership between the UN Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space and the International Atomic Energy Agency. The Safety Framework reflects an international consensus on best practices to achieve safety. Following the 1992 UN Principles Relevant to the Use of Nuclear Power Sources in Outer Space, it is the second attempt by the international community to draft guidance promoting the safety of applications of nuclear power sources in space missions. NPS applications in space have unique safety considerations compared with terrestrial applications. Mission launch and outer space operational requirements impose size, mass and other space environment limitations not present for many terrestrial nuclear facilities. Potential accident conditions could expose nuclear power sources to extreme physical conditions. The Safety Framework is structured to provide guidance for both the programmatic and technical aspects of safety. In addition to sections containing specific guidance for governments and for management, it contains technical guidance pertinent to the design, development and all mission phases of space NPS applications. All sections of the Safety Framework contain elements directly relevant to engineers and space mission designers for missions involving space nuclear power sources. The challenge for organisations and engineers involved in the design and development processes of space nuclear power sources and applications is to implement the guidance provided in the Safety Framework by integrating it into the existing standard space mission infrastructure of design, development and operational requirements, practices and processes. This adds complexity to the standard space mission and launch approval processes. The Safety Framework is deliberately generic to remain relevantly independent of technological progress, of national organisational setups and of space mission types. Implementing its guidance therefore leaves room for interpretation and adaptation. Relying on reported practices, we analyse the guidance particularly relevant to engineers and space mission designers.","Nuclear power sources,COPUOS,Safety,STSC,Safety framework,"
"seamless and energy-efficient maritime coverage in coordinated 6g spaceâ€“airâ€“sea non-terrestrial networks","2023","Non-terrestrial networks (NTNs), which integrate space and aerial networks with terrestrial systems, are a key area in the emerging sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks. As part of 6G, NTNs must provide pervasive connectivity to a wide range of devices, including smartphones, vehicles, sensors, robots, and maritime users. However, due to the high mobility and deployment of NTNs, managing the space-airâ€“sea (SAS) NTN resources, i.e., energy, power, and channel allocation, is a major challenge. The design of an SAS-NTN for energy-efficient resource allocation is investigated in this study. The goal is to maximize system energy efficiency (EE) by collaboratively optimizing user equipment (UE) association, power control, and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) deployment. Given the limited payloads of UAVs, this work focuses on minimizing the total energy cost of UAVs (trajectory and transmission) while meeting EE requirements. A mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem is proposed, followed by the development of an algorithm to decompose, and solve each problem distributedly. The binary (UE association) and continuous (power, deployment) variables are separated using the Bender decomposition (BD), and then the Dinkelbach algorithm (DA) is used to convert fractional programming into an equivalent solvable form in the subproblem. A standard optimization solver is utilized to deal with the complexity of the master problem for binary variables. The alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm is used to solve the subproblem for the continuous variables. Our proposed algorithm provides a suboptimal solution, and simulation results demonstrate that the algorithm achieves better EE and spectral efficiency (SE) than baselines.","Satellites,telecommunication power management,channel allocation,binary variables,coordinated 6G,telecommunication computing,total energy cost,convex programming,energy-efficient resource allocation,sixth-generation (6G) networking,integer programming,Resource management,multipliers algorithm,Alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM),concave programming,terrestrial systems,space-air-sea NTN resources,5G mobile communication,spectral efficiency,continuous variables,unmanned aerial vehicle deployment,energy-efficient maritime coverage,optimisation,high mobility,Low earth orbit satellites,nonterrestrial networks,satellite-access networks,Dinkelbach algorithm (DA),key area,6G mobile communication,mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem,Synthetic aperture sonar,master problem,NTNs,spaceâ€“airâ€“sea (SAS) communication,Satellite constellations,Satellite broadcasting,autonomous aerial vehicles,aerial networks,nonlinear programming,power control,Bender decomposition (BD),maritime users,pervasive connectivity,standard optimization solver,system energy efficiency,marine communication,energy conservation,emerging sixth-generation wireless networks,Dinkelbach algorithm,seamless,UE association,user equipment association,resource allocation,Backhaul networks,unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV),UAV,"
"practical multichannel sar imaging in the maritime environment","2018","The U.S. Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) recently developed an X-band airborne multichannel synthetic aperture radar (MSAR) test bed system that consists of 32 along-track phase centers.

This paper presents a detailed experimental analysis of imaging in the maritime domain using data captured by the NRL MSAR system. After presenting some of the important details of our NRL MSAR system, we demonstrate velocity-based imaging of a variety of moving backscatter sources including ships and shoaling ocean waves. Our analysis is based on the velocity SAR (VSAR) technique, which was originally conceived by Friedlander and Porat. Practical application of this algorithm in the maritime domain requires a number of pre- and postprocessing stages, which are described here in detail.

"data-driven fraud detection in international shipping","2018","Document fraud constitutes a growing problem in international shipping. Shipping documentation may be deliberately manipulated to avoid shipping restrictions or customs duties. Well-known examples of such fraud are miscoding and smuggling. These are cases in which the documentation of a shipment does not correctly or entirely describe the goods in transit. In an attempt to reduce the risks of document fraud, shipping companies and customs authorities typically perform random audits to check the accompanying documentation of shipments. Although these audits detect many fraud schemes, they are quite labor intensive and do not scale to the massive amounts of cargo that is shipped each day. This paper investigates whether intelligent fraud detection systems can improve the detection of miscoding and smuggling by analyzing large sets of historical shipment data. We develop a Bayesian network that predicts the presence of goods on the cargo list of shipments. The predictions of the Bayesian network are compared with the accompanying documentation of a shipment to determine whether document fraud is perpetrated. We also show how a set of discriminative models can be derived from the topology of the Bayesian network and perform the same fraud detection task. Our experimental results show that intelligent fraud detection systems can considerably improve the detection of miscoding and smuggling compared to random audits.","Neural networks,International shipping,Fraud detection,Logistic regression,Bayesian networks,Probablistic classification,"
"sponges as libraries: increase in microplastics in cinachyrella alloclada after 36 years","2022","Many studies investigated the presence and effects of microplastics in marine species, but data about sponges are still incipient. We quantified these pollutants in a population of the tropical sponge Cinachyrella alloclada, comparing museum specimens sampled in 1981 with specimens sampled in 2017. The mean number of microplastics in specimens collected decades ago was one order of magnitude lower (0.13 ± 0.40/g of sponge tissue) than those sampled more recently (1.37 ± 0.94/g). We observed microplastics in only 10 % of the specimens collected in 1981 but in 80 % of those from 2017. According to Raman spectroscopy, fibers in C. alloclada consisted of polypropylene. Our results reinforce the importance of natural history collections to reduce the gap of knowledge on the interaction between marine sponges and microplastics.","Pollution dynamic,Northeastern Brazil,Marine pollution,Benthic community,Porifera,Temporal change,"
"real-time event-based tracking and detection for maritime environments","2021","Event cameras are ideal for object tracking applications due to their ability to capture fast-moving objects while mitigating latency and data redundancy. Existing event-based clustering and feature tracking approaches for surveillance and object detection work well in the majority of cases, but fall short in a maritime environment. Our application of maritime vessel detection and tracking requires a process that can identify features and output a confidence score representing the likelihood that the feature was produced by a vessel, which may trigger a subsequent alert or activate a classification system. However, the maritime environment presents unique challenges such as the tendency of waves to produce the majority of events, demanding the majority of computational processing and producing false positive detections. By filtering redundant events and analyzing the movement of each event cluster, we can identify and track vessels while ignoring shorter lived and erratic features such as those produced by waves.","surveillance,subsequent alert classification system,image motion analysis,Feature extraction,maritime vessel detection,redundant events,Filtering,activate a classification system,object tracking,data redundancy,false positive detections,real-time systems,event-based clustering,Hardware,cameras,object detection,computational processing,event cameras,image classification,pattern clustering,Real-time systems,marine engineering computing,Redundancy,maritime environment,Object detection,Surveillance,time event-based tracking,object tracking applications,event cluster,"
"deeptracks: geopositioning maritime vehicles in video acquired from a moving platform","2021","Geopositioning and tracking a moving boat at sea is a very challenging problem, requiring boat detection, matching and estimating its GPS location from imagery with no common features. The problem can be stated as follows: given imagery from a camera mounted on a moving platform with known GPS location as the only valid sensor, we predict the geoposition of a target boat visible in images. Our solution uses recent ML algorithms, the camera-scene geometry and Bayesian filtering. The proposed pipeline first detects and tracks the target boatâ€™s location in the image with the strategy of tracking by detection. This image location is then converted to geoposition to the local sea coordinates referenced to the camera GPS location using plane projective geometry. Finally, target boat local coordinates are transformed to global GPS coordinates to estimate the geoposition. To achieve a smooth geotrajectory, we apply unscented Kalman filter (UKF) which implicitly overcomes small detection errors in the early stages of the pipeline. We tested the performance of our approach using GPS ground truth and show the accuracy and speed of the estimated geopositions.

"detecting anomalous deviations from standard maritime routes using the ornsteinâ€“uhlenbeck process","2018","A novel anomaly detection procedure based on the Ornsteinâ€“Uhlenbeck (OU) mean-reverting stochastic process is presented. The considered anomaly is a vessel that deviates from a planned route, changing its nominal velocity $\boldsymbol{v}_0$. In order to hide this behavior, the vessel switches off its automatic identification system (AIS) device for a time  $T$ and then tries to revert to the previous nominal velocity $\boldsymbol{v}_0$. The decision that has to be made is declaring that a deviation either happened or not, relying only upon two consecutive AIS contacts. Furthermore, the extension to the scenario in which multiple contacts (e.g., radar) are available during the time period $T$ is also considered. A proper statistical hypothesis testing procedure that builds on the changes in the OU process long-term velocity parameter $\boldsymbol{v}_0$ of the vessel is the core of the proposed approach and enables the solution of the anomaly detection problem.

"multi-hop wireless transmission for maritime scenarios","2023","The collection and processing of maritime information is an essential task that demands extensive analysis to achieve a more profound understanding of coastal regions. Usually, data is gathered through sensors placed on buoys and transmitted to onshore data centres for storage and examination. Nevertheless, the harsh marine environment, including waves, wind, and vessel traffic, creates substantial challenges for effectively managing this task. This paper focuses on two key objectives: firstly, introducing a physical model for electromagnetic propagation in a buoy network that takes into account the unique characteristics of the marine environment, and secondly, evaluating the performance of the physical model in a multi-hop data transmission scenario using a LoRaWAN mesh network. The main aim of the proposed approach is to facilitate efficient communication while optimising the utilisation of reconfigurable devices to reduce power consumption and accelerate data transmission.

"seaweed and climate change: a mapping review","2023","Seaweed has garnered increasing interest due to its capacity to mitigate climate change by curbing carbon emissions from agriculture, as well as its potential to serve as a supplement or alternative for dietary, livestock feed, or fuel source production. Moreover, seaweed is regarded as one of the earliest plant forms to have evolved on Earth. Owing to the extensive body of literature available and the uncertainty surrounding the future trajectory of seaweed research under evolving climate conditions, this review scrutinizes the structure, dynamics, and progression of the literature pertaining to seaweed and climate change. This analysis is grounded in the Web of Science Core Collection database, augmented by CiteSpace software. Furthermore, we discuss the productivity and influence of individual researchers, research organizations, countries, and scientific journals. To date, there have been 8047 articles published globally (after a series of filters and exclusions), with a notable upswing in publication frequency since 2018. The USA, China, and Australia are among the leading countries contributing to this research area. Our findings reveal that current research on seaweed and climate change encompasses 13 distinct research clusters, including “marine heatwave”, “temperate estuary”, “ocean acidification”, and “macroalgal bloom”.

The seaweed species most commonly referenced in relation to climate change include Gracilaria sp., Sargassum sp., Ecklonia maxima, and Macrocystis pyrifera. These results provide valuable guidance for shaping the direction of specialized topics concerning marine biodiversity under shifting climate conditions.

The common AD methods composing our baseline will be One-Class Support Vector Machines (OC-SVM), Isolation Forest (IF), Local Outlier Factor (LOF) and a Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE). The more innovative AD methods put forward by this work are Deep Support Vector Data Description (Deep SVDD) and Random Projection Depth (RPD), belonging respectively to deep and shallow AD. The semi-supervised adaptation of Deep SVDD constitutes our SAD method. HRRP data was generated by a coastal surveillance radar, our results thus suggest that AD can contribute to enhance maritime and coastal situation awareness.","semisupervised anomaly detection methods,Pollution,unusual radar targets,benchmark gathering,Support vector machines,Anomaly detection,radar detection,HRRP targets,anomaly detection,unsupervised learning,high-resolution range profiles,Neural networks,semisupervised adaptation,novelty detection methods,radar target detection,radar computing,innovative anomaly,support vector machines,SAD method,machine learning,object detection,radar target recognition,innovative AD methods,search radar,identified environment,Deep SVDD,high-resolution range profile,Radar,common AD methods,convolutional neural nets,labeled anomalies,Training,One-Class Support Vector Machines,neural network,semisupervised AD,Radar detection,"
"blockchain-based privacy-preserving positioning data sharing for iot-enabled maritime transportation systems","2023","Data-driven applications play an important role in modern-time maritime transportation systems, for instance in facilitating decision-making relating to communication and safety. One example application is position data sharing between vessels within the maritime Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled context. When designing such applications, we need to also consider how to ensure data accuracy as well as privacy in a large scale deployment. In this paper, we demonstrate the potential of using blockchain to facilitate privacy-preserving data sharing. Specifically, we develop a zero-knowledge proof-based scheme to protect vessel identities while allowing data sharing, and a commitment-based approach to ensure relationship-related privacy in data trading between participants. Our security and performance evaluations demonstrate the utility of the proposed approach.","Blockchains,Transportation,data-driven applications,positioning error data sharing,privacy-preserving,Internet of Things,decision-making,transportation,Sensor systems,blockchains,maritime Internet,position data,safety,modern-time maritime transportation systems,blockchain-based privacy-preserving positioning data sharing,relationship-related privacy,commitment-based approach,data trading,Blockchain,Privacy,Things-enabled context,decision making,privacy-preserving data sharing,data accuracy,Sensors,zero-knowledge proof-based scheme,Smart contracts,data privacy,Global navigation satellite system,IoT-enabled maritime transportation systems,maritime transportation system,"
"geotracknetâ€”a maritime anomaly detector using probabilistic neural network representation of ais tracks and a contrario detection","2022","Representing maritime traffic patterns and detecting anomalies from them are key to vessel monitoring and maritime situational awareness. We propose a novel approachâ€”referred to as GeoTrackNetâ€”for maritime anomaly detection from AIS data streams. Our model exploits state-of-the-art neural network schemes to learn a probabilistic representation of AIS tracks and a contrario detection to detect abnormal events. The neural network provides a new means to capture complex and heterogeneous patterns in vesselsâ€™ behaviours, while the a contrario detector takes into account the fact that the learnt distribution may be location-dependent. Experiments on a real AIS dataset comprising more than 4.2 million AIS messages demonstrate the relevance of the proposed method compared with state-of-the-art schemes.","heterogeneous patterns,motion estimation,GeoTrackNet,naval engineering computing,Anomaly detection,Geospatial analysis,anomaly detection,probabilistic representation,variational recurrent neural networks,AIS messages,maritime traffic patterns,maritime anomaly detector,AIS dataset,maritime situational awareness,neural nets,probabilistic neural network representation,deep learning,ships,marine engineering,AIS data streams,complex patterns,contrario detection,AIS,maritime surveillance,object detection,Probabilistic logic,a contrario detection,Artificial intelligence,maritime anomaly detection,Trajectory,Task analysis,vessel monitoring,contrario detector,learning (artificial intelligence),state-of-the-art neural network schemes,Detectors,AIS tracks,"
"a stackelberg game-theoretical approach to maritime counter-piracy","2019","In this paper, we provide a maritime counter-piracy framework to represent the strategies put in place and the interaction between a set of actors (patrollers and attackers) in a wide maritime scenario. Specifically, we model the interaction between patrollers and attackers in terms of a Stackelberg leader-follower game. With respect to the previous literature, we provide several innovations, in that we consider moving targets. Moreover, we let the attackers and patrollers ground their decisions not only on the current situation, but also on the expected evolution in the short or medium term. This is done by introducing in the payoff functions some projection terms, i.e., elements able to consider the future evolution of the scenario, up to a specified time window horizon. We conclude this paper with a simulation campaign considering a realistic test bed settled in the Gulf of Aden. Our experiments show that such a prediction is quite effective in generating better decisions allowing the patrollers to dynamically change targets. However, if the time horizon considered in the projection term is too large, we observe that the patrollers tend to patrol the area rather than focusing on specific vessels, and the resulting protection strategy has reduced effectiveness.","wide maritime scenario,moving targets,Bayes methods,specified time window horizon,Games,Stackelberg game-theoretical approach,Game theory,game theory,counter-piracy,maritime counter-piracy framework,Iris,future evolution,Antiterrorism,patrolling,defense strategy,Stackelberg leader-follower game,projection,Airports,Terrorism,"
"leveraging graph and deep learning uncertainties to detect anomalous maritime trajectories","2022","Understanding and representing traffic patterns are key to detecting anomalous trajectories in the transportation domain. However, some trajectories can exhibit heterogeneous maneuvering characteristics despite confining to normal patterns. Thus, we propose a novel graph-based trajectory representation and association scheme for extraction and confederation of traffic movement patterns, such that data patterns and uncertainty can be learned by deep learning (DL) models. This paper proposes the usage of a recurrent neural network (RNN)-based evidential regression model, which can predict trajectory at future timesteps as well as estimate the data and model uncertainties associated, to detect anomalous maritime trajectories, such as unusual vessel maneuvering, using automatic identification system (AIS) data. Furthermore, we utilize evidential deep learning classifiers to detect unusual turns of vessels and the loss of transmitted signal using predicted class probabilities with associated uncertainties. Our experimental results suggest that the graphical representation of traffic patterns improves the ability of the DL models, such as evidential and Monte Carlo dropout, to learn the temporal-spatial correlation of data and associated uncertainties. Using different datasets and experiments, we demonstrate that the estimated prediction uncertainty yields fundamental information for the detection of traffic anomalies in the maritime and, possibly in other domains.","Monte Carlo methods,classification,recurrent neural nets,graph,deep learning (artificial intelligence),Anomaly detection,DL models,graph-based trajectory representation,automatic identification system data,Monte Carlo dropout,graphical representation,traffic movement patterns,detect anomalous maritime trajectories,Predictive models,regression analysis,evidential deep learning,marine engineering,Data models,data patterns,pattern classification,Artificial intelligence,graph theory,RNN,regression,clustering,uncertainty,Trajectory,Uncertainty,probability,Computational modeling,traffic engineering computing,recurrent neural network-based evidential regression model,deep learning uncertainties,AIS data,"
"ensemble estimates reveal a complex hydroclimatic sensitivity of pine growth at carpathian cliff sites","2012","Carpathian pine growth at its natural range limit, where small hydroclimatic fluctuations are indicated by tree-ring width anomalies, may provide insight into past ecological responses to climatic changes. Tree-ring chronologies from extreme cliff sites may also contain annually resolved and accurately dated information to facilitate the development of palaeoclimatic reconstructions. Complex and spatiotemporally inconsistent relationships between biotic and abiotic factors, however, often complicate our understanding of forest growth dynamics. In this study, we utilized a novel ensemble approach of 3240 growth–climate interactions to evaluate the likelihood of temporal fluctuations in the hydroclimatic sensitivity of three newly developed tree-ring width chronologies from 515 Scots pines (Pinus sylvestris). The data represent undisturbed cliff habitats across the northwestern Carpathian arc between 700 and 1050m asl. These sites are located in the northern (N) and southern (S) Tatra Mountains and in-between (M). Two sites (N, S) share common interannual to multi-decadal ring width variability (r=0.73), and they significantly capture variations in 20th-century summer drought conditions (r=0.52–0.65). Temporal instability in the growth–climate response, however, occurred in all three tree-ring chronologies, thus challenging any possible palaeoclimatic value. Orographic-induced climatology was found to dominate the observed growth–climate inconsistency, whereas age-related physiological mechanisms and differences in the absolute growth levels of the trees, as well as methodological standardization constraints and seasonal climate differences appeared to be less important. Our results suggest that environmental and ecological site criteria should be routinely supplemented by statistical data assessments prior to employing tree-ring chronologies for climate reconstructions.","Tatra Mountains,Dendroclimatology,Drought,Tree rings,Dendroecology,Climate variability,"
