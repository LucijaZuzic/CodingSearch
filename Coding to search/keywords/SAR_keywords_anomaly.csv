"change detection and maritime situation awareness in the channel area - feasibility of space borne sar for maritime situation awareness","2012","In this paper we have analyzed military and security requirements for surveillance. Using a data-set of wide swath SAR imagery for the English Channel and high resolution SAR data for the Zeebrugge and Rotterdam harbour we have discussed if these requirements can be met by using this kind of data. The requirement to detect anomalous behaviour at open sea can be fulfilled for ships with sizes >; 30 meter if appropriate context information is available. Displacement of not too small vessels and preparatory activities for illegal trafficking can often be detected in high resolution imagery. However, details and detection of replacements of these objects cannot be obtained.","Satellites,surveillance,Zeebrugge harbour,wide swath SAR imagery,Rotterdam harbour,spaceborne SAR,Marine vehicles,SAR,Synthetic aperture radar,Change Detection,geophysical image processing,high resolution imagery,high resolution SAR data,illegal trafficking,Military Requirements,English Channel area,change detection,object detection,synthetic aperture radar,search radar,Europe,oceanographic regions,Maritime Situation Awareness,Image resolution,military requirements,open sea,maritime situation awareness,spaceborne radar,Surveillance,Security,security requirements,context information,"

"coastal sar and plrm altimetry in german bight and west baltic sea","2018","Unlike previous altimetric missions, the CryoSat-2 altimeter features a novel Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) mode that allows higher resolution and more accurate altimeter-derived parameters in the coastal zone, thanks to the reduced along-track footprint. The scope of this study is to quantify regionally the skills of CryoSat-2 SAR altimetry for distances to coast smaller than 10 km, during the mission lifetime and at different time scales. The validated geophysical altimeter parameters are the sea surface height above the ellipsoid, the significant sea wave height and wind speed, all computed at 20 Hz. These have been compared to in situ and regional model data along the coasts of German Bight and West Baltic Sea during a time interval of almost six years, from July 2010 to March 2016, to investigate both instantaneous and seasonal behaviour. From CryoSat-2 FBR (Full Bit Rate) data, a Delay-Doppler processing and waveform retracking tailored specifically to the coastal zone has been carried out, by applying a Hamming window and zero-padding, using an extended vertical swath window in order to mitigate tracker errors. Moreover, a dedicated SAMOSA-based coastal retracker (here referred to as SAMOSA+) has also been implemented. Since one of the highest remaining uncertainties in the altimeter parameters estimated in coastal shallow waters arises from residual errors in the applied range and geophysical corrections, innovative and high resolution solutions for ocean tide model, geoid, mean sea surface and wet tropospheric correction have been selected. As CryoSat-2 SAR and LRM (Low Rate Mode) modes are not collocated in time, in order to quantify the improvement in the coastal zone with respect to pulse-limited altimetry, 20 Hz PLRM (pseudo-LRM) data from CryoSat-2 FBR were built and retracked, adopting the ALES adaptive sub-waveform approach, with a numerical Brown-based retracker, here referred to as TALES. The cross-validation proves the good consistency between PLRM and SAR sea level anomaly in the coastal zone. The regional ocean model (BSH) shows the highest agreement with the SAR sea level anomaly, with a standard deviation of the differences (stdd) of 24 cm, whereas the corresponding value with respect to PLRM is 55 cm. Distance to coast plots show that land contamination begins to affect sea level and wave measurements at 2 km from the coast in SAR and at 3.5 km in PLRM TALES. The analysis of monthly mean time-series shows that SAR Altimetry is able to measure the sea level monthly mean in the coastal zone of the region of interest, during the entire mission, more precisely than PLRM. The cross-validation against in situ data also proves the higher accuracy of SAR SAMOSA+ compared to PLRM TALES in the coastal zone, with average SLA stdd of 4.4 cm and 8.4 cm respectively.","Sea level,SAR altimetry,CryoSat-2,Coastal altimetry,Retracking,In situ validation,"
"comparison of target detectors to identify icebergs in quad- polarimetric sar alos-2 images","2021","Icebergs represent hazards to ships and maritime activities and therefore their detection is essential. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellites are very useful for this, due to their capability to acquire under cloud cover and during polar nights. Additionally, polarimetry has been proven to improve the detection capability. In this work, we compare six state-of-the-art quad polarimetric detectors to test their performance and ability to detect small sized icebergs in four locations in Greenland. These were the polarimetric notch filter (PNF), polarimetric match filter (PMF), polarimetric whitening filter (PWF), optimal polarimetric detector (OPD), reflection symmetry detector, and the dual polarisation anomaly detector (iDPolRAD). We use four single look complex ALOS-2 quad pol images. The data were calibrated and processed. We produce the covariance matrices of each image before applying a testing and training window for detection. We also add a guard window to reduce false alarms. Our results show that the multi-look polarimetric whitening filter and optimal polarimetric detector provide the most optimal performance in quad and dual pol mode detection.","Satellites,sized icebergs,covariance matrices,Synthetic Aperture Radar satellites,multilook polarimetric whitening filter,Marine vehicles,Polarimetry,SAR,geophysical image processing,detection capability,ships,Reflection,matched filters,Oceans,object detection,reflection symmetry detector,synthetic aperture radar,target detectors,Iceberg,radar imaging,identify icebergs,Training,Target Detection,Matched filters,polarimetry,optimal polarimetric detector,dual pol mode detection,radar polarimetry,single look complex ALOS-2 quad pol images,dual polarisation anomaly detector,quad- polarimetric sar alos-2,state-of-the-art quad polarimetric detectors,notch filters,remote sensing by radar,Detectors,Detection,"

"radar/ais data fusion and sar tasking for maritime surveillance","2008","Numerous national and multinational initiatives in maritime surveillance have been initiated, with the goal of having knowledge of all coastal and open-seas activities relevant to national security. As part of this effort, NATO is pursuing research activities to exploit existing multi-sensor systems in support of maritime surveillance. Multi-sensor fusion of data from maritime surveillance assets provides a consolidated surveillance picture for anomaly detection. This paper develops a model for multisensor fusion and Bayesian anomaly detection that quantifies the value of sensor data for maritime surveillance performance. An approach to satellite imagery tasking for optimal surveillance performance is also given. Simulation results corroborate our analysis.","Automatic Identification System (AIS),marine radar,anomaly detection,Bayes methods,satellite imagery tasking,SAR,SAR imagery,target tracking,image fusion,automatic identification system,Multi-sensor fusion,Maritime Surveillance,maritime surveillance,AIS,synthetic aperture radar,search radar,multisensor data fusion,NATO,radar imaging,Bayesian anomaly detection,radar tracking,national security,spaceborne radar,coastal radar,"

"improving sar wind retrieval through automatic anomalous pixel detection","2023","Satellite observations are increasingly in demand and valuable for monitoring the ocean and coastal winds in near-real-time and analyzing the data historically. However, soared up human activities, man-made constructions, and marine traffics negatively interfere and affect the reliability of observations and raise concerns about the trustworthiness of using satellite winds for many applications, such as offshore wind energy, even though Sentinel synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data is freely and easily accessible. In this paper, we presented a novel methodological framework for localization and suppression of anomalous pixels (APs), which deteriorate the confidence and accuracy of the retrieved SAR wind speeds. The backbone of the implementation relied on the constant false alarm rate (CFAR) algorithm, one of the automatic target recognition algorithms. We used a large dataset of SAR subscenes to model different sea clutter conditions after removing the potential targets. We selected the suitable distribution model that maintains a constant probability of false alarm (pfa) for the entire SAR scene. The proper pfa was optimized in various SAR scenes ranging from scenes with a considerable number of APs, such as ships and wind park clusters, to scenes with no visible APs under different wind speed conditions. The pfa optimization process prevented real wind pixels from being misidentified as APs. Applying CFAR to the logarithmic scale of raw digital numbers (log-DNs) domain with a pfa of about 3.17 × 10-5, we extracted SAR wind speeds around each ocean buoy before and after CFAR process, comparing them with their corresponding in situ wind measurements. This led to significant improvement in the quality and accuracy of SAR wind data retrieval, especially in regions with numerous man-made constructions and high marine traffics. We tested and validated our approach in the North Sea and two regions along the eastern coast of the U.S. The enclosed region, serving as a marine route for harbors in Delaware Bay, showed a substantial improvement in RMSE and BIAS after applying our approach, reducing RMSE from 2.4 m/s to 1.6 m/s and the BIAS from −1.5 m/s to −0.3 m/s. The open ocean region demonstrated stable RMSE and BIAS, indicating preservation of real wind data, as only APs affecting SAR wind speed were considered during the process.","Offshore wind farm,SAR,Sentinel-1,CFAR,Anomalous pixel,Coastal environment,"
