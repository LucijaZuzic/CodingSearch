"underwater archaeological investigation using ground penetrating radar: a case analysis of shanglinhu yue kiln sites (china)","2018","In this study we explored the possibility and effectiveness of applying ground penetrating radar (GPR) to investigate underwater cultural relics. Using this innovative technique, the remains of Yue kiln and anomalous objects buried beneath the lake or suspended in the water can now be fully studied. Although GPR has been widely used for imaging archaeological sites, skepticism remains over its use in underwater archaeology. Nevertheless, some scholars suggest that it is possible to use GPR to detect underwater remains, which has been further confirmed by the use of electrical parameter measurement (EPM) in Shanglinhu Lake. An experiment was performed by our team using antennas of different frequencies in a particular area of the lake. The results showed that the penetrability of the 100 MHz antenna was enough to examine the targets, while the 400 MHz antenna performed well in shallow water (depth <4 m) due to higher resolution. Hence, for our underwater investigation, we used both antennas for maximum coverage. We used a radargram as a topographic map which shows cross sections of the lake. Analysis of the Shanglinhu Lake data indicated that GPR is a superior tool for underwater archaeological investigation. Traditional methods including sonar, underwater cameras and salvage dives were used as supporting techniques in the study.","Underwater archaeological investigation,Ground penetrating radar,Yue kiln remains,"
"ship anti-grounding with a maritime autonomous surface ship and digital twin of port of hamburg","2023","We present the virtual demonstration of a novel ship Anti-Grounding Service in a digital twinned use case scenario in the Port of Hamburg. The scenario is generated from real bathymetry survey data collected in the Port. The virtual model of a Maritime Autonomous Surface Ship travels the route ahead of merchant ships on approach to the Port and is integrated with a real-time high-resolution Multibeam SONAR Simulator that synthesizes underkeel survey data. The automated data processing workflow detects potential grounding hazards in the synthetic survey data and provides a real-time update of the Port nautical chart, which is presented in the Electronic Chart Display and Information System of a Ship Handling Simulator. Our method is the first to consider Multibeam SONAR equipped Maritime Autonomous Surface Ship platforms for provision of ship Anti-Grounding Services. The results validate the full-scale simulation and automated hazard detection workflow and incorporate tests conducted with certified mariners (N=10) to address human factors of introducing new technologies into safety critical situations. The key contributions of this work are summarized as: 1) Validation of Maritime Autonomous Surface Ships as an Anti-Grounding Service delivery platform; 2) Demonstration of a Digital Twin for hydrography survey and bottom hazard detection; and 3) Experimental validation with certified mariners of the anti-grounding service Human-Computer Interface on the ship bridge.","digital twinned use case scenario,automated data processing workflow,ship antigrounding service,underkeel survey data,electronic chart display,Bridges,human factors,bathymetry survey data,safety,grounding hazards,antigrounding service delivery platform,hydrography,Surveys,digital twins,ships,marine safety,maritime autonomous surface ship platforms,autonomous,port nautical chart,synthetic survey data,Seaports,object detection,automated hazard detection workflow,simulation,digital twin,ship handling simulator,sonar,unmanned vehicle,Autonomous aerial vehicles,bathymetry,Real-time systems,antigrounding service human-computer interface,real-time high-resolution multibeam SONAR simulator,merchant ship,Hazards,hazards,Hamburg port,SONAR,ports,navigation,Digital twins,merchant ships,oceanographic techniques,ship bridge,"
"concurrent use of satellite imaging and passive acoustics for maritime domain awareness","2010","The research being conducted in the Center for Secure and Resilient Maritime Commerce (CSR), a DHS National Center of Excellence for Port Security examines some basic science issues and emerging technologies to improve the security of ports and inland waterways, as well as coastal and offshore operations. This research follows a layered approach utilizing above water and underwater surveillance techniques. The investigated layers include satellite-based wide area surveillance; HF Radar systems providing over-the-horizon monitoring; and nearshore and harbor passive acoustic surveillance. Integration of these systems is aimed at achieving vessel detection, classification, identification, and tracking. In this paper, we present the results of sea tests where satellite imagery was combined with concurrent passive acoustic surveillance. The wide area sensing was provided by the University of Miami CSTARS facility's electro-optical (EO) and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite imaging capabilities. Satellites detected the ships using a panchromatic EO sensor FormoSat-2 and SAR from the COSMO-SkyMed constellation. The Stevens Passive Acoustic System was used for detecting sound produced by the same ships that were detected by satellites. Concurrent Satellite - Acoustic measurements provide the following advantages: 1. Increasing the probability of small vessel detection and decreasing false alarms. 2. The joint systems can provide redundant detection and classification in conditions where one of the systems fails. For example, EO satellite imaging does not work at night and in fog and cloudy conditions while acoustic detection has limits during stormy weather due to ambient noise. SAR imaging can detect vessels in all weather, but provides less detail about a specific vessel. 3. Acoustics can provide target classification and bearing and satellites can give target localization and heading. SAR data can be used to estimate vessel speed in some cases. 4. Satellite imaging is helpful for the acoustic detection of an underwater target in cases when satellite information allows separation of surface and underwater targets. 5. Joint measurements provide more data (information) for target classification. Several tests were conducted in New York Harbor, where the satellite images and acoustic signatures of the same boats were recorded. The satellite registered a number of small boats. The small boats were acoustically detected at distances up to 4 km and the signal generated by a passenger ferry was observed at a distance up to 7 km.","Satellites,military radar,Stevens passive acoustic system,CSTARS facility's electro-optical radar,maritime domain awareness,acoustic signature,maritime security,underwater vehicles,DHS National Center of Excellence,acoustic detection,satellite tracking,Acoustic sensing,target tracking,Center for Secure and Resilient Maritime Commerce,Miami University,HF radar systems,synthetic aperture radar,satellite imaging,panchromatic EO sensor,underwater surveillance,port security,radar imaging,vessel detection,optical radar,underwater acoustic communication,New York Harbor,Acoustics,offshore operations,Boats,Sonar equipment,coastal operations,satellite sensing,passive acoustics,acoustic surveillance,Surveillance,FormoSat-2,COSMO-SkyMed constellation,Security,target classification,"
"the lama system: a “smart” magnetometer network for harbour protection","2022","This work describes the development of an underwater anti-intrusion system based on a magnetometer self-informed network, whose purpose is to detect the presence of threats in the proximity of critical infrastructures (e.g, terrorist divers in harbours). In this context, the magnetic network fills the gaps of sonar systems at the critical boundaries of the water volume to be controlled (sea bed, docks, …), where acoustic performances deteriorate due to reflections and attenuations. The system operates in a port-protection scenario, characterized by a medium-high environmental magnetic noise that can hide the diver signal (a diver is a weak, quasi-point-like, moving source). The magnetometer network processes two inputs: the environmental magnetic noise and a signal including the target magnetic signal superimposed to the same noise; the frequencies of a diver signal lie within the noise band, hence frequency filtering proves inadequate for noise removal. The basic idea underlying the system is to measure and use the noise itself to filter the overall signal; measuring noise supports a background-subtraction process that allows to extract the target signal and therefore detect the threat presence. The effectiveness of the procedure depends on the positions of magnetometers: sensors must be close enough to one another to measure the common background noise, and, at the same time, should be distant enough from one another so that just one sensor can measure the target signal. To generate alarms when a threat is detected, a real-time software application processes data and activates a visual and acoustic alarm upon identification of a magnetic anomaly. Sea trials carried out in port areas provided extremely satisfactory results in the detection of intruders. The paper presents experimental results obtained during the method validation tests, when intruders were moving in the surrounding undersea environment.","Environmental magnetism,Marine geophysics,Time series analysis,Magnetic anomaly detection,Underwater magnetic systems,Harbour protection,"
"volcanic and tectonic features of shirahama bank in the northern ryukyu arc: implications for cross-arc volcanism controlled by arc-parallel extension","2021","This paper presents volcanic and tectonic features of Shirahama Bank, an unexplored shallow submarine edifice in the northern Ryukyu Arc which was previously poorly mapped, and consequently the nature of its volcanism and tectonism have been poorly understood. New high-resolution (5 m) bathymetry revealed that Shirahama Bank has small volcanic edifices and depressions on its flat top with water depths of 60–150 m. The edifices have pointy summits with steep slopes greater than 30°. Within the depressions, a total of 59 acoustic bubble plumes were detected by shipboard multibeam sonar, suggesting that active volcanic degassing occurs in this region. The bank is dissected entirely by NW–SE to WNW–ESE trending lineaments while the volcanic edifices and depressions on the flat top are undissected. Shirahama Bank was formed by multiple-stages of volcanism. The youngest volcanic stage probably occurred after surface erosion by sea-level low-stand during the late Pleistocene and after tectonic deformation, providing a constraint on the timing of Quaternary volcanism in the northern Ryukyu Arc. Structural control of arc volcanism in the area is observed. The NW–SE to WNW–ESE lineaments identified on and around Shirahama Bank are interpreted as normal faults and form cross-arc graben structures. The young volcanic structures and active bubble plumes at Shirahama Bank and surrounding areas are concentrated within these cross-arc grabens, suggesting that the most recent volcanism is controlled by ~NE–SW extension (arc-parallel or along-arc extension) in the northern Ryukyu Arc. Our results, combined with previous studies, suggest that arc-parallel extension, which differs from the previously known back-arc extension in the Okinawa Trough, plays an important role in arc volcanism during its initial stages.","Ryukyu Arc,Bubble plume,Arc-parallel extension,Cross-arc volcanism,"
"ammunition detection using high frequency multibeam snippet backscatter information","2018","The present study reports the evaluation of snippet backscatter information gathered with a high-frequency multibeam echosounder system (200–400 kHz) due to their usability to detect ammunition of different sizes in shallow coastal waters. Besides the feasibility of the snippet backscatter data, it was focused on the attainable horizontal accuracy in comparison to side-scan sonar and autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) surveys. The data was collected in shallow coastal waters of up to 18 m water depth (Baltic Sea) close to an ammunition dumping site characterized by an almost flat seafloor covered with sand and silt sediments. The analysis of the multibeam compared to sidescan data indicates the snippet backscatter to be a promising prospective method for ammunition detection and being able to improve horizontal position accuracy of up to 0.08 m.","Snippet backscatter,UXO,DGNSS,Baltic Sea,Ammunition detection,Multibeam echosounder,"
"autonomous inspection of underwater structures","2015","In the future our resource on land will be over exploited. The exploration of new resources in the ocean is in progress. Mining will be done on the bottom of the sea. The sea is also a big source of renewable energy. Off shore wind parks and tide plants are built. Also, the major world trade is handled over sea routes and several big harbors. All this maritime facilities are getting older and there are effects like corrosion or malfunctions. In general, they need to be inspected frequently. For deep sea applications, security reasons and cost reduction autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) will be the first choice. The project “CView” addresses one of these inspection problems, the harbor inspection. But the algorithms, we present in this article can be adapted to many other inspection tasks. One of the main goals in this project is to find cracks or damaged areas at the underwater buildings or to observe critical sections under water with cost effective methods. The platform for developing the guidance algorithms for inspection is the AUV “SeaCat”. This underwater vehicle has a control software system with an user interface for mission planning, a mission control system, a precise navigation system, optimized motor control with an autopilot and sensors for obstacle detection and inspection. For obstacle and inspection target detection, a scanning sonar is used. The sonar images are automatically processed with edge detection and line extraction algorithms to get a simplified environment description, which is used by the guidance methods presented in this article. A pan–tilt enabled sensor head with camera, laser measurement and MBES (Multi Beam Echo Sounder) is used to inspect the detected objects. Additionally, these sensors provide distance information to the inspection object which can be used by the inspection guidance. This article presents methods for inspection using the online information from the vehicle sensors to guide the vehicle efficient and safely. It is also important to handle the interaction between mission planning and execution. During mission planning, the operator will define the type of the inspection object (wall, vessel, sluice, etc.). The algorithms we develop use the information from the mission planning and the online data from the vehicle sensors to guide the vehicle to get the optimal inspection results. Therefore, a precise distance control to the inspection object, collision avoidance and object recognition are needed.","AUV,Underwater,Inspection,Guidance,Autonomous,"
"insights and guidance for offshore co2 storage monitoring based on the qics, eti mmv, and stemm-ccs projects","2020","Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is a collective term for technologies that allow society to unlock the benefits of energy intensive processes like fertiliser production and combustion of fuels (fossil or biologically sourced) without releasing the CO2 to the atmosphere. Hence, CCS could assist in accelerating decarbonisation while society pursues a just energy transition. This paper aims to summarise the learnings of three research projects that all investigated aspects of marine monitoring for CCS from a CO2 storage operator’s perspective. The QICS (Quantifying and Monitoring Potential Ecosystem Impacts of Geological Carbon Storage), ETI MMV (Energy Technologies Institute Measurement, Monitoring and Verification of CO2 Storage), and STEMM-CCS (Strategies for Environmental Monitoring of Marine CCS) projects collectively represent over twelve years of dedicated research to assess environmental impacts and to develop technologies for detection, location, and quantification of potential leakage from offshore geological storage of CO2. Each project used controlled releases in representative environments to test their methods and technologies. QICS as the first of the three projects, focused on the understanding of sensitivities of the UK marine environment to a potential leak from a CO2 storage complex and tested technologies to detect such emissions. The ETI MMV project brought together research and industry partners to develop and sea trial an operational, integrated and cost-effective marine monitoring system for geological CO2 storage. As a commercial project, these results have never been published before and this paper shares for the first-time insights from this work. In February 2020, STEMM-CCS, completed its quest to test techniques for environmental monitoring over a marine CO2 storage site in the UK North Sea, further improved near seabed leakage characterisation capabilities, and delivered a first marine CCS demonstration level ecological baseline. This paper aims to summarise some of the key insights from the three projects and provides references where available for the interested reader. The key finding of all three projects is that the impacts of small to medium CO2 leakages from large-scale storage are limited and localised. Technology capabilities exist for integrated marine CO2 storage monitoring and their performance has been benchmarked at controlled release trials. Even small leakages of 10−50 L/min can be detected at unknown locations in a large area of interest. Finally, the first important steps towards automated monitoring data analysis have been made, including automated leakage signal detection from Side Scan Sonar data (ETI MMV project) and automated species identification from marine biology images (STEMM-CCS project). Some remaining challenges include missed/false alerts because of large variations in the background signal, the cost of monitoring large areas over long periods, and making real-time decisions based on big data. Continued work to reduce the cost of marine monitoring technologies and advancing automation of data processing and analysis will be important in order to support safe and efficient offshore CCS deployment at large scale.","CCS,Location,Offshore CO2 storage,Regulation,Impact assessment,Quantification,Monitoring,Verification,Detection,Attribution,"
"adaptive mission planning for cooperative autonomous maritime vehicles","2013","This paper addresses the problem of developing an autonomous cooperative multi-vehicle system composed of one simple low-cost unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV) guided by a more capable, sensor-equipped, surface or underwater vehicle. Specifically, in this work we consider a system composed of an autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) able to localize a small-sized UUV via a multibeam sonar and, then, to guide it via an acoustic link to reach a target. The UUV is equipped with low-cost navigation sensors (a compass and a depth sensor), and to estimate its own position relies on the data received by the ASV (range and bearing from the ASV and ASV position). This paradigm was applied in the domain of mine countermeasures (MCM) to realize the NATO CMRE Autonomous Mine Neutralization System. In this system the low-cost feature of the UUV is of the most importance since the UUV is supposed to be expendable. In this approach, however, there may be cases in which the underwater vehicle cannot be detected by the sonar for extended time periods causing drifts in the UUV position estimate, potentially compromising the mission. This paper presents a set of behaviors to address this situation. The behaviors coordinate ASV circular search patterns together with sending to the UUV purposely generated navigation updates. The aim is to limit the distance between the two vehicles, increasing the probability of sonar reacquisition, and at the same time ensuring that the UUV progresses toward the target. Results from sea trials held in Elba island (Italy) during ANT12 experiments (in June 2012) are reported, and demonstrate the approach is effective and can push our system toward full autonomy.","autonomous cooperative multivehicle system,mine countermeasures domain,low-cost navigation sensors,ANT12 experiments,multi-robot systems,control engineering computing,small-sized UUV,NATO CMRE Autonomous Mine Neutralization System,ASV position bearing,Elba island,Italy,Sonar navigation,navigation updates,Vehicles,sonar reacquisition probability,autonomous surface vehicle,Three-dimensional displays,software architecture,adaptive mission planning,autonomous underwater vehicles,simple low-cost unmanned underwater vehicle,time periods,ASV circular search patterns,compass,Sonar,vehicle distance,sensors,sonar,multibeam sonar,Acoustics,depth sensor,path planning,cooperative autonomous maritime vehicles,ASV,mobile robots,MCM domain,Sensors,ASV position range,acoustic link,sensor position estimation,"

"keynote: multi-domain situational awareness - from the underwater to the space domain to improve maritime surveillance","2022","Modern surveillance systems require to integrate coherently all available sources of information to compose an operational picture that is as complete as possible. While in the past surveillance had suffered from a lack of data, current technology transformed the problem into one of an overabundance of information, leading to an extreme need for automated analysis. Indeed, current surveillance sensors generate volumes of data that would have been unthinkable only a few years ago. Therefore, all the processing, algorithm calibration, parameter tuning, etc., need to be executed as much automatically as possible. This also requires novel paradigms for algorithmic design. In this respect, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Data Fusion (DF) offer an unprecedented opportunity to strengthen the technological edge; however, the risk is to elevate, at the same time, the speed of the threats we face. Indeed, the surveillance task is complicated by the diversification of threats, whose nature and origin is most often unknown. AI and DF techniques have the potential to identify patterns emerging within these very large datasets, fused from a variety of sources and generated from monitoring wide areas on a day-to-day basis, and use the learned knowledge to anticipate the possible evolution(s) of the operational picture. The presentation will focus on both real-world scenarios and theoretical models, spanning from the underwater to the space domain, including the analysis of scenarios with heterogeneous surveillance sensors (such as radar, sonar and satellite).

"treat noise as domain shift: noise feature disentanglement for underwater perception and maritime surveys in side-scan sonar images","2023","In underwater perception and maritime surveys, due to the scarcity of training data and perturbation of speckle noise, the detection performance of underwater objects in side-scan sonar (SSS) images is limited. To address these problems, we proposed a noise feature disentanglement YOLO (NFD-YOLO) by combining noise-agnostic features learning and attention mechanism. Firstly, we rethink the speckle noise by treating it as the domain shift between the training dataset and real-measured SSS images and build a domain generalization-based (DG-based) underwater object detection framework. Then, we extend YOLOv5 with a feature manipulation module, a noise-agnostic subnetwork, and an auxiliary noise-biased subnetwork for noise features disentanglement, more biases toward noise-agnostic features and less reliance on noise-biased features in underwater object detection, respectively. Finally, the ACmix attention module is introduced for a more powerful learning capacity and attention to the object areas based on a small dataset. According to the experiment results, the proposed NFD-YOLO achieved 75.1% mean average precision (mAP) in the test domain, which increased by 7.5% than YOLOv5, and 75.7% Â± 0.4% mAP and 77.5% Â± 1.6% mAP for different speckle noise distributions and transfer directions, respectively, which verified its generalization ability and robustness for speckle noise. Therefore, the proposed method can mitigate the effects of speckle noise and provides a new thought to address the speckle noise in underwater object detection with a small dataset, which is of significance and benefits for underwater perception and maritime surveys.","Training,Sonar,Detectors,speckle noise,Feature extraction,Sonar detection,underwater object detection,feature disentanglement,side-scan sonar,attention mechanism,Reverberation,domain generalization,Speckle,"
"potential impact of long-life environmental sonobuoys on littoral asw","2009","The focus of military activity has recently shifted from large area engagements to regional conflicts. Consequently, supportive Naval maritime operations have continued to evolve toward littoral warfare in complicated shallow-water, near-shore environments. This evolution requires new sensors, advanced Concept of Operations, and improved data-analysis capabilities, among others. Planning operations in these harsh-environment areas is difficult because accurate predictions of tactical sensor performance depend on detailed knowledge of the local environmental conditions. Tactical mission planning is thus seldom optimal or efficient, often resulting in coverage gaps, increased risk, and reduced mission success. According to a Navy Mission Need Statement, 'Air ASW tactical execution, especially in littoral seas, requires in-situ environmental updates for preflight mission planning. In the conduct of ASW operations, an urgent need for explicit knowledge of environmental variables is required to optimize the effectiveness of operational acoustic sensors, as well as acoustic sensors in development ' The Naval Air Systems Command has considered extended-life environmental sonobuoy concepts to better characterize the littoral environment. Most designs contain a thermistor string to measure ocean temperatures and also hydrophones to measure ambient noise. This type of complex sonobuoy would be more expensive than a traditional single-measurement AXBT but it could provide a more thorough littoral environment assessment. This paper examines the trade-off between increased sensor complexity and improved ASW performance, in terms of cumulative detection probability. Some advantages of an extended-life combined thermistor string/hydrophone approach, compared to AXBTs and tactical hydrophones, are: 1) higher accuracy of the raw data; 2) temporal averaging to smooth out fluctuations; 3) extended area coverage during drift; 4) less chance for surface temperature anomalies (e.g., mixed-layer-depth errors) caused by various electronic and mechanical variability upon impact; 5) opportunities to discover thermal and acoustic feature boundaries during drift; and 6) less need to re-seed thus allowing longer tactical mission times. These advantages are evaluated relative to the following disadvantages: 1) increased cost; 2) potential drift outside the mission area; and 3) need for increased battery life for longer durations. The analysis is tempered by considering how a potential new system might be used. One assumption is that an environmental sampling decision aid is available to determine the minimum number and best initial locations of drifting sensors to meet performance objectives. The November 2007 Requirements Document from the Naval Oceanographic Office states ?Sampling guidance: Development of guidance on the best way to deploy, spatially and temporally, observation systems in order to meet various forecasting, model assimilation, and model evaluation objectives is needed.? Work in this area is reported in this Oceans '09 Conference in a paper entitled ?Uncertainty-based Adaptive AXBT Sampling with SPOTS?, which addresses optimal sampling requirements. For this trade-off analysis, temperature data from watersampling flights in the Sea of Japan off the east coast of Korea were used to simulate expected capability of a long-term drifting thermistor string. Then optimal initial positions for three notional buoys were determined followed by a simulation of drifting positions and data collected over 12 days. Ocean nowcasts were constructed and used to determine acoustic performance of a notional tactical sonobuoy field. The analysis shows that a drifting extended-life thermistor string can provide significant improvement in environmental characterization, tactical planning, and ASW detection performance.","Acoustic measurements,Sea measurements,military systems,Predictive models,Sonar equipment,Sampling methods,Ocean temperature,Noise measurement,littoral ASW,operational acoustic sensors,Thermistors,Temperature measurement,Acoustic sensors,long-life environmental sonobuoys,"
"survey on deep learning based computer vision for sonar imagery","2022","Research on the automatic analysis of sonar images has focused on classical, i.e. non deep learning based, approaches for a long time.

Most research in this field has been directed towards the investigation of convolutional neural networks (CNN) for feature extraction and classification tasks, with the result that even small CNNs with up to four layers outperform conventional methods. The purpose of this work is twofold. On one hand, due to the quick development of deep learning it serves as an introduction for researchers, either just starting their work in this specific field or working on classical methods for the past years, and helps them to learn about the recent achievements. On the other hand, our main goal is to guide further research in this field by identifying main research gaps to bridge.

Analyses are based on the interpretation of acoustic data (Multibeam Echosounder and Side Scan Sonar) acquired in the Taranto coastal area. Specific GIS tools supported the acoustic data analysis, interpretation, and mapping. These analyses highlighted that the seafloor of both coastal basins included in the investigated area is affected by a high distribution of traces related to different anthropogenic activities such as dredging, shipping, and mussel farming activities. Such kind of traces resulted efficiently detectable from morpho-bathymetric acoustic data. In particular, groove traces resulted highly distributed in both basins, while sunken mussel farm facilities are widely distributed in the Mar Grande basin. The results highlight as acoustic surveys represent a useful tool for orienting effective coastal management actions.

The electro-optical (EO) sensor considered here is a video camera that operates in the visible or the infrared spectra, which conventionally complements radar and sonar for situational awareness at sea and has demonstrated its effectiveness over the last few years. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of various approaches of video processing for object detection and tracking in the maritime environment. We follow an approach-based taxonomy wherein the advantages and limitations of each approach are compared. The object detection system consists of the following modules: horizon detection, static background subtraction, and foreground segmentation. Each of these has been studied extensively in maritime situations and has been shown to be challenging due to the presence of background motion especially due to waves and wakes. The key processes involved in object tracking include video frame registration, dynamic background subtraction, and the object tracking algorithm itself. The challenges for robust tracking arise due to camera motion, dynamic background, and low contrast of tracked object, possibly due to environmental degradation. The survey also discusses multisensor approaches and commercial maritime systems that use EO sensors. The survey also highlights methods from computer vision research, which hold promise to perform well in maritime EO data processing. Performance of several maritime and computer vision techniques is evaluated on Singapore Maritime Dataset.","Image edge detection,electro-optical sensors,sensor fusion,infrared spectra,Cameras,Marine vehicles,Singapore maritime dataset,static background subtraction,maritime EO data processing,video frame registration,maritime object detection,multisensor approaches,computer vision techniques,object tracking,ships,EO sensor,marine engineering,maritime navigation,computer vision,autonomous automobiles,object detection,horizon detection,commercial maritime systems,Radar tracking,navigational system,taxonomy,Maritime vehicles,electro-optical devices,image registration,video signal processing,environmental degradation,video camera,maritime environment,sea situational awareness,dynamic background subtraction,Object detection,image segmentation,foreground segmentation,video processing,autonomous ships,Intelligent sensors,video cameras,"

"insights from archaeological analysis and interpretation of marine data sets to inform marine cultural heritage management and planning of wave and tidal energy development for orkney waters and the pentland firth, ne scotland","2014","The Orkney archipelago has a rich heritage that includes the Heart of Neolithic Orkney World Heritage Site, Viking settlements, harbours supplying Hudson's Bay Company ships, and the wartime naval base of Scapa Flow. This rich history has left its mark on the seabed but accurate maps showing the location and character of surviving seabed archaeology do not exist to the same extent as for archaeology on land. ORCA Marine was commissioned by Historic Scotland to work with the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland in interrogating marine data sets to enhance historic environment records of Orkney Waters and the Pentland Firth. These waters were prioritised for their history of maritime activity and to help guide planning and developments in an area highlighted by the Scottish Government for marine renewable energy. A variety of recent and legacy datasets, including wreck databases; sonar data gathered by public sector bodies; aerial photography; seabed cores; Admiralty charts; and local knowledge, were examined for their effectiveness in discovering and interpreting marine cultural heritage cost-effectively. A methodology was developed that enabled marine cultural heritage information to be quickly assimilated within the national and regional inventories for dissemination online. Polygonisation of records resulted in GIS-based shapefiles identifying site extents, and areas of archaeological potential in relation to wrecks, submerged prehistoric landscapes, anchorages and fishing areas. Substantial gaps in data coverage were identified and areas of the seabed have been surveyed at resolutions that are sufficient to detect large upstanding remains such as iron shipwrecks but insufficient to identify smaller archaeological features. Other geophysical datasets have been created at a resolution detailed enough to allow the recognition of smaller anomalies but in some cases processing of the data has removed small anomalies of interest to archaeologists. Intensively used marine areas often contain the most artefactual remains such as historic ports being developed to service the marine renewable industry. Zones of high wave and tidal energy favoured for renewable energy devices include navigation channels and hazards where a large number of wrecks are documented. Transmission cable routes cross deep water where 20th-century wartime losses occurred. Planning and development of infrastructure relating to renewables may also interact with significant built heritage and archaeology on the foreshore and coast edge.",""

"environmental services embedded on maritime unmanned systems for asw decision support","2021","In recent work [1] the authors evaluated the effectiveness of using embedded on board ASW decision support services as a means to increase the effectiveness of autonomous area search. An area search metric based on a cumulative probability of detection grid was developed that was robust to moving targets and which exploited a priori knowledge of the environment. Results showed that the proposed environmentally sensitive search yielded a higher measure of effectiveness in comparison to a simple search pattern that did not exploit information made available by an embedded environmentally sensitive ASW decision support service.In order to exploit environmental services for environments where the relevant parameters affecting acoustic propagation and scattering are not available, the development of a dedicated set of environmental services that provide the environmental parameters required is of high interest. In this paper we evaluate the possibility to extract an estimate of the bottom scattering strength from the measurements assuming complete knowledge of all other parameters.","decision support systems,autonomous area search,naval engineering,embedded environmentally sensitive ASW decision support service,environmental parameters,Sea measurements,military systems,underwater vehicles,maritime unmanned systems,environmental services,Scattering,ASW,multistatic,Oceans,autonomous underwater vehicles,RAPS,MSTPA,simple search pattern,decision making,Acoustic propagation,board ASW decision support services,Acoustic measurements,probability,mobile robots,Rapid Environmental Assessment,SONAR,area search metric,environmentally sensitive search,decision support,UUV,"

"cognitive mimo sonar based robust target detection for harbor and maritime surveillance applications","2009","Robust detection of various hostile threats is vital to protect Navy ships and other facilities within harbor and maritime environments. Traditional single-input single-output (SISO) sonar transmits single acoustic waveform by single projector, which has a few disadvantages including low target detection probability, low resolution, vulnerability of interception by the enemy, sensitivity to jamming, etc. Multi-input multi-output (MIMO), typically applied to communications and radar solutions, is an emerging technology that can be applied to sonar to overcome many of the SISO sonar disadvantages. In this paper, cognitive monostatic/bistatic/multistatic MIMO sonar approaches are proposed. MIMO sonar transmits different orthogonal acoustic waveforms from multiple projectors with different spatial distributions. Through space-time-waveform diversity, MIMO sonar is able to apply coherent processing techniques over the received signals, and acquires more diversity gains. The cognition concept proposed in the literature for radar and wireless communication is applied to MIMO sonar to improve its robustness and adaptability. The advantages of proposed cognitive MIMO sonar will be demonstrated by Monte Carlo computer simulations and compared to the SISO techniques.","MIMO,surveillance,Monte Carlo methods,acoustic waveform,Sonar detection,Sonar applications,Acoustic waves,sonar signal processing,maritime surveillance,object detection,Navy ships,robust target detection,hostile threats,Acoustic signal detection,Protection,Radar,harbor surveillance,Robustness,marine communication,Object detection,SISO sonar,Surveillance,cognitive MIMO sonar,MIMO communication,Monte Carlo computer simulations,"

"a lightweight approach to simulate a 2d radar coverage for virtual maritime environments","2013","Virtual simulation systems present a cost effective way of training the mariners to navigate a ship in a realistic maritime environment. To offer a better training session, a need arises to model other tools and components as a part of the virtual simulation system, such as radar, sonar and telescope, that are used to navigate a vessel in the real world. Taking a light-weighted approach, we developed a virtual radar coverage for the Vidusayura virtual maritime learning environment. It simulates an actual marine radar, which gathers information of its surroundings from the virtual environment with which a trainee naval officer interacts.

"sensor information fusion architecture for virtual maritime environment","2012","This paper presents a ongoing research on generic sensor fusion architecture and its application to a maritime surveillance system. The importance of information fusion for various sensor types and specialized sensor fusion systems in various domains are discussed. In sensor fusion, centralized versus decentralized refers to where the fusion of the data occurs. In centralized fusion, the clients simply forward all of the data to a central location, and some entity at the central location is responsible for correlating and fusing the data. In this research we intend to correlate multiple maritime sensors such as RADAR, AIS, and other electronic object detection systems. Sri Lanka Navy has myriad of surveillance information sources such as AIS (Automatic Identification System), RADAR (Radio Aid Detection and Ranging), SONAR (Sound Navigation and Ranging), MSTT, HFSWR, AVL (Automatic Vessel Locating), HF Communication, Intelligence Data ect. So it is obvious that an information fusion methodology is needed to harness the effectiveness of multiple sensor information. An object identification pipeline is conceptualized such that an unknown object in the maritime domain is detected reducing the uncertainty of obtained information. The radical new virtual reality application has been developed to visualize the information fused from sensors and discussed in depth in addition to the introduction of the fusion process. The technologies used in developing the virtual world and incorporating the real time information in to the virtual world is presented in simplified modal for the purpose of clarity. Also design aspects and some experimental analysis developed in an applied project at the Sri Lanka Navy intended to demonstrate fusion technologies in this environment through an operative prototype are presented.","object identification pipeline,sensor fusion,virtual reality,virtual reality application,maritime sensor,operative prototype,Solid modeling,data visualisation,Mobile communication,sensor information fusion architecture,centralized data fusion,object detection,Networked information processing,Radar tracking,fused information visualization,virtual maritime surveillance system,Computational modeling,central location,Tactical display,video surveillance,virtual world,Information fusion,oceanographic techniques,"
