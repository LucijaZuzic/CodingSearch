"ship anti-grounding with a maritime autonomous surface ship and digital twin of port of hamburg","2023","We present the virtual demonstration of a novel ship Anti-Grounding Service in a digital twinned use case scenario in the Port of Hamburg. The scenario is generated from real bathymetry survey data collected in the Port. The virtual model of a Maritime Autonomous Surface Ship travels the route ahead of merchant ships on approach to the Port and is integrated with a real-time high-resolution Multibeam SONAR Simulator that synthesizes underkeel survey data. The automated data processing workflow detects potential grounding hazards in the synthetic survey data and provides a real-time update of the Port nautical chart, which is presented in the Electronic Chart Display and Information System of a Ship Handling Simulator. Our method is the first to consider Multibeam SONAR equipped Maritime Autonomous Surface Ship platforms for provision of ship Anti-Grounding Services. The results validate the full-scale simulation and automated hazard detection workflow and incorporate tests conducted with certified mariners (N=10) to address human factors of introducing new technologies into safety critical situations. The key contributions of this work are summarized as: 1) Validation of Maritime Autonomous Surface Ships as an Anti-Grounding Service delivery platform; 2) Demonstration of a Digital Twin for hydrography survey and bottom hazard detection; and 3) Experimental validation with certified mariners of the anti-grounding service Human-Computer Interface on the ship bridge.","digital twinned use case scenario,automated data processing workflow,ship antigrounding service,underkeel survey data,electronic chart display,Bridges,human factors,bathymetry survey data,safety,grounding hazards,antigrounding service delivery platform,hydrography,Surveys,digital twins,ships,marine safety,maritime autonomous surface ship platforms,autonomous,port nautical chart,synthetic survey data,Seaports,object detection,automated hazard detection workflow,simulation,digital twin,ship handling simulator,sonar,unmanned vehicle,Autonomous aerial vehicles,bathymetry,Real-time systems,antigrounding service human-computer interface,real-time high-resolution multibeam SONAR simulator,merchant ship,Hazards,hazards,Hamburg port,SONAR,ports,navigation,Digital twins,merchant ships,oceanographic techniques,ship bridge,"
"satellite-derived bathymetry for maritime archaeology: testing its effectiveness at two ancient harbours in the eastern mediterranean","2021","High-resolution bathymetry is an essential tool in maritime archaeology, often used for underwater prospection, imaging, palaeo-landscape reconstruction and change detection. The commonest acquisition method relies on shipborne acoustic systems (e.g. multibeam echosounder). However, most of the world’s seabed has not been surveyed using these methods. Derivation of bathymetry from high-resolution multispectral satellite imagery (Satellite-Derived Bathymetry: SDB) can redress this in shallow (<20–30 m depth) clear water. It can be derived empirically using depth control points, or independent of control data through physics-based approaches. Given global satellite coverage, it is applicable almost anywhere with suitable water conditions and is becoming increasingly widespread in the hydrographic survey community. However, archaeological application of SDB is almost totally un-investigated. This paper examines the utility of SDB for maritime archaeology through 2 case studies: the ancient harbours of Tyre (Lebanon) and Ras Ibn Hani (Syria). Tested data comprise 2 m-resolution physics-based commercial SDB and medium-resolution (10–30 m) SDB empirically derived from open access multispectral imagery (Landsat 8, Sentinel-2). SDB was assessed for its ability to detect submerged cultural features and landforms and as input into palaeo-geographic reconstructions. Tested SDB performed poorly for feature detection, but was better-suited to landform identification and palaeo-geographic reconstruction. SDB also has clear advantages: low cost, wide area coverage, speed and data availability. Disadvantages include variable accuracy, technical limitations (e.g. need for clear water) and approach-specific requirements (e.g. depth control points for empirical and complex modelling for physics-based approaches). For maritime archaeology, its current limitations means that it will not replace acoustics for prospection and imaging but it does have utility for submerged landscape investigation and reconstruction, particularly in areas which now only have no/poor bathymetric data.","Bathymetry,SDB,Submerged landscapes,Geoarchaeology,Shipwrecks,Satellite imagery,"
"assessment of marine litter through remote sensing: recent approaches and future goals","2021","This bibliographic review provides an overview of techniques used to detect marine litter using remote sensing. The review classified studies in terms of platform (satellite, aircrafts, drones), sensors (passive or active), spectral (visible, infrared, microwaves), spatial resolution (<1 to >30 m), type and size (macroplastics, microplastics), or classification methodology (sighting, photointerpretation, supervised). Most studies applied satellite information to address marine litter using multi- and hyper- spectral optical sensors. The correspondence analysis on analyzed variables exhibited that aircrafts with high spatial resolution (<3 m) with optical sensors (λ = 400 to 2500 nm) seem to be the most optimum combination to target marine litter, while satellites carrying Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensors (λ = 3.1 to 5.6 cm) may detect sea-slicks associated to surfactants that might contain high concentration of microplastics. Gaps indicate that future goals in marine litter detection should be addressed with platforms including optical and SAR sensors.","SAR,Remote sensing,Sea-slicks,Marine plastic litter,Optical sensors,"
"research on ship abnormal behavior detection method based on graph neural network","2022","Because of the existing maritime intelligent supervision, ship abnormal behavior detection ignores the interdependence between different time series of ships and different abnormal behavior characteristics, which leads to poor real-time performance and limited detection accuracy of abnormal detection. This paper explores the mechanism of ship abnormal behavior monitoring and detection based on graph attention network. This mechanism uses a sliding window to generate fixed data input, uses graph attention network to capture the dependence between ship behavior characteristics, and determines the threshold of anomaly according to the sea environment set in this paper. In order to complete the online real-time detection of ship abnormal behavior with multivariate and multidimensional time series, improve the accuracy of ship abnormal behavior detection and reduce the blind area of VTS (Vessel Traffic Service) system monitoring.","ship abnormal behavior monitoring,VTS system,sea environment set,graph attention network,multivariate time series,graph neural network,Marine vehicles,neural nets,Mechatronics,ships,marine safety,VTS system monitoring,multidimensional time series,sliding window,Data models,object detection,vessel traffic service,Time series analysis,existing maritime intelligent supervision,online real-time detection,Real-time systems,graph theory,time series,ship abnormal behavior detection method,Trajectory,maritime supervision,fixed data input generation,Cognition,traffic engineering computing,ship abnormal behavior detection,abnormal behavior characteristics,ship behavior characteristics,"
"intelligent permaculture: a sustainable and profitable practice for tropical and maritime climate urban and peri-urban agricultural ecosystems","2021","Permaculture is a land management and regenerative agriculture that is the integration of technological advancement and the natural agricultural ecosystems. It is usually manifested in green architecture and balcony gardens in an urban area. However, peri-urban geographical regions are those situated in between urban and rural areas that are experiencing the impacts of modernizing community and conventional farming. This study discusses the technological drivers making intelligent permaculture ecosystems and applications, the current issues and challenges in this emerging agricultural and horticultural scheme, and a set of future directives in intelligent permaculture ecosystems in a tropical and maritime climatic setting.

"assessment of the resilience of a complex network for crude oil transportation on the maritime silk road","2020","As one of the most strategically important natural resources, crude oil can be dangerous to transport by sea. The resilience of a maritime transport network denotes the ability of the system to withstand damage and remain operational after disturbances, representing the invulnerability of the network and its ability to recover from harm. In this study, we built a crude oil transportation network titled the Maritime Silk Road using Automatic Identification System (AIS) sensor data, designed a resilience assessment framework based on complex network theory, and assessed the resilience of the maritime crude oil transportation network from both qualitative and quantitative perspectives with the help of complex network metrics and a resilience model. The results show that the topology of the crude oil transportation network has a significant impact on its resilience, in that network density and centrality are negatively related to network resilience, whereas network connectivity and size are positively related to resilience. Subsequently, the resilience of crude oil transportation networks declines at a steady rate under random attacks but declines sharply under intentional attacks. Finally, a comprehensive analysis of invulnerability and recovery in the context of resilience concludes that strengthening small and medium-sized ports in the network is important to enhance network resilience. These results can provide reference and decision support for port planning, route design, optimization, and form a foundation for a more secure and reliable maritime transportation network system.","resilience assessment framework,Safety,maritime transport network,crude oil transportation network,complex network metrics,goods distribution,network resilience,Resilience,Maritime Silk Road,complex network theory,reliable maritime transportation network system,complex network,Oils,network connectivity,secure maritime transportation network system,network theory (graphs),Complex networks,Artificial intelligence,sea ports,crude oil,network density,Roads,maritime crude oil transportation network,mathematical analysis,petroleum industry,complex networks,AIS data,maritime silk road,"
"cyber risk perception in the maritime domain: a systematic literature review","2021","This paper aims to present an approach to investigate cyber risk perception with use of recognized psychological models, and to give an overview of state-of-the-art research within the field of cyber risk perception in general and in the context of the maritime domain. The focus will be on determinative dimensions within the psychometric paradigm and cognitive biases, and to give recommendations on further research within these fields. Okoli and Schabramâ€™s eight-step guide to plan, select, extract, and execute a systematic literature review is used as guidance. The search process resulted in 25 relevant articles which describes 24 dimensions of cyber risk perception in different online environments. Research within the area of maritime cyber security is increasing, however, no studies relevant for our literature review were found within the maritime domain. The nine dimensions in the psychometric model, perceived benefit and the optimistic bias is presented and discussed in a maritime context. Cyber risk perception is a complex research-area where both determinative factors and other cognitive processes can be influenced by each other. This can indicate that the dimensions differ across populations and professions, creating grounds for why context-specific studies are important. Further research may benefit from more multidisciplinary, descriptive, and inductive approaches, and contextual studies within maritime cyber risk perception can contribute to develop targeted tools for risk mitigation to enhance safety at sea.","risk perception,Safety,online environments,systematic literature review,maritime cyber risk perception,human behavior,security of data,human factors,psychology,Cyberspace,cognition,search process,Bibliographies,marine safety,psychological models,marine engineering,cognitive biases,project management,Computer crime,cognitive processes,maritime cyber security,cyberpsychology,risk analysis,Psychology,psychometric paradigm,Maritime cyber security,Tools,risk communication,Systematics,"
"maritime containers tracking trial results","2009","There are approximately 7 million maritime-style containers within Canada, and 70 million within the US. The interiors of such containers are rarely inspected. With market globalization, a large amount of these containers enter North America on a daily basis. Such containers may include contraband or dangerous items that present an economic or security risk. Despite significant security improvements, only 3 to 5 % of the maritime containers, that arrive in, or transition through, North America, go through physical inspection. Current container tracking technologies based on GPS consume high DC power, are costly, require line-of-sight with satellites, and are often too large to be covert. It is possible to overcome some of these limitations by basing the tracking system on the FM broadcast signal which is an alternative man-made signal that is reasonably ubiquitous, provides a geographically-unique frequency spectrum and is about 100,000 times as strong as a GPS satellite signal. This allows the development of a low-cost, low-power and miniature FM receiver that can record frequency spectrums and compare them to known data in order to trace the path that the container has taken for less than $10 per container. This presents the first results of highway trials (train and sea trials are currently being conducted) of such a low-cost, covert, non-GPS based technology (called 'FM Tag') that records the worldwide displacement of containers and displays the path undertaken by the container while in transit. As an added security benefit, the tag is also capable of detecting container door openings. In addition to presenting the first trial results, this covers the innovative engineering aspects of using the metal enclosure of a maritime container as a VBF antenna, thereby eliminating the need to add an external antenna and achieving the goal of being 100% covert.","maritime containers tracking,US,Inspection,Canada,VHF antennas,Global Positioning System,FM broadcast signal,metal enclosure,Containers,Globalization,frequency spectrum,containers,market globalization,GPS,Satellite broadcasting,North America,Frequency,Road transportation,container tracking technologies,VHP antenna,Power generation economics,Security,"
"graph representation learning with encoding edges","2019","Network embedding aims at learning the low dimensional representation of nodes. These representations can be widely used for network mining tasks, such as link prediction, anomaly detection, and classification. Recently, a great deal of meaningful research work has been carried out on this emerging network analysis paradigm. The real-world network contains different size clusters because of the edges with different relationship types. These clusters also reflect some features of nodes, which can contribute to the optimization of the feature representation of nodes. However, existing network embedding methods do not distinguish these relationship types. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised network representation learning model that can encode edge relationship information. Firstly, an objective function is defined, which can learn the edge vectors by implicit clustering. Then, a biased random walk is designed to generate a series of node sequences, which are put into Skip-Gram to learn the low dimensional node representations. Extensive experiments are conducted on several network datasets. Compared with the state-of-art baselines, the proposed method is able to achieve favorable and stable results in multi-label classification and link prediction tasks.","Edge representation,Feature learning,Network mining,Network embedding,"

"an effective presentation of navigation information for prevention of maritime disaster using ais and 3d-gis","2013","We present a method for communicating navigation information that will assist operators to prevent maritime disaster. Although this topic has been extensively researched, the navigational situation of vessels has received little attention. However, such a navigational situation is essential for understanding water bodies and ensuring maritime safety. To provide effective navigation information, this study first analyzes the actual situation of vessel traffic using Automatic Identification System (AIS) data. Operators can be based on the analysis to understand the trend of navigation ships in water bodies as an important reference. From the results of the analysis, we constructed a representable navigational information system. Different information was unified on a Geographical Information System (GIS) in two-and three-dimensional formats. The system was demonstrated in a navigation simulation of a real voyage ship in Osaka Bay, Japan. The integrated information can be comprehensively and realistically interpreted by operators. Therefore, the system is expected to effectively avoid maritime disaster.","marine accidents,voyage ship,3D GIS,Maritime traffic,Safety,navigation information presentation,Marine vehicles,marine navigation,data visualisation,effective navigation information,Automatic Identification System data,vessel traffic,Japan,Voyage simulation,maritime disaster prevention,marine safety,Oceans,Educational institutions,Maritime disaster,geographic information systems,3D-GIS data,Osaka Bay,Navigation,Information systems,navigation information communication,marine control,Geographic information systems,AIS data,Geographical Information System,maritime safety,"
"a big data architecture for managing oceans of data and maritime applications","2017","Data in the maritime domain is growing at an unprecedented rate, e.g., terabytes of oceanographic data are collected every month, and petabytes of data are already publicly available. Big data from heterogeneous sources such as sensors, buoys, vessels, and satellites could potentially fuel a large number of interesting applications for environmental protection, security, fault prediction, shipping routes optimization, and energy production. However, because of several challenges related to big data and the high heterogeneity of the data sources, such applications are still underdeveloped and fragmented. In this paper, we analyze challenges and requirements related to big maritime data applications and propose a scalable data management solution. A big data architecture meeting these requirements is described, and examples of its implementation in concrete scenarios are provided. The related data value chain and use cases in the context of a European project, BigDataOcean, are also described.","big maritime data applications,Oceanographic Data,Marine vehicles,data sources,scalable data management solution,Sea measurements,related data value chain,Big Data applications,ships,heterogeneous sources,marine engineering,maritime domain,maritime applications,Big Data,Maritime Applications,Engines,Big Data Applications,Temperature sensors,oceanographic data,oceanographic techniques,"
"spatial ontologies for detecting abnormal maritime behaviour","2012","The upsurge in piracy and the impact of recent environmental disasters have highlighted the need to improve maritime surveillance. Governmental and private initiatives have developed monitoring systems with improved acquisition and analysis capabilities. These systems rely on one major component, namely the detection of abnormal ship behaviour. This implies a detailed formalisation of expert knowledge. However, the quantity of data, the complexity of situations, the failure to take into account their spatial characteristics and the potential for the same scenario to be interpreted in different ways have proved to be significant problems. We therefore propose a new prototype for the analysis of abnormal ship behaviour. The system is based on a spatial ontology associated with a geographical inference engine.

"unsupervised maritime traffic graph learning with mean-reverting stochastic processes","2018","Inspired by the fair regularity of the motion of ships, we present a method to derive a representation of the commercial maritime traffic in the form of a graph, whose nodes represent way-point areas, or regions of likely direction changes, and whose edges represent navigational legs with constant cruise velocity. The proposed method is based on the representation of a ship's velocity with an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process and on the detection of changes of its long-run mean to identify navigational way-points. In order to assess the graph representativeness of the traffic, two performance metrics are introduced, leading to distinct graph construction criteria.

"mining vessel tracking data for maritime domain applications","2016","The growing number of remote sensing systems and ship reporting technologies (e.g. Automatic Identification System, Long Range Identification and Tracking, radar tracking, Earth Observation) are generating an overwhelming amount of spatio-temporal and geographically distributed data related to vessels and their movements. Research on reliable data mining techniques has proven essential to the discovery of knowledge from such increasingly available information on ship traffic at sea. Data driven knowledge discovery has very recently demonstrated its value in fields that go beyond the original maritime safety and security remits of such data. They include, but are not limited to, fisheries management, maritime spatial planning, gridding ship emissions, mapping activities at sea, risk assessment of offshore platforms, and trade indicators. The extraction of useful information from maritime Big Data is thus a key element in providing operational authorities, policy-makers and scientists with supporting tools to understand what is happening at sea and improve maritime knowledge. This work will provide a survey of the recent JRC research activities relevant to automatic anomaly detection and knowledge discovery in the maritime domain.

"diapycnal diffusivity in the core and oxycline of the tropical north atlantic oxygen minimum zone","2016","Diapycnal diffusivity estimates from two Tracer Release Experiments (TREs) and microstructure measurements in the oxycline and core of the oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) in the Eastern Tropical North Atlantic (ETNA) are compared. For the first time, two TREs within the same area at different depths were realized: the Guinea Upwelling Tracer Release Experiment (GUTRE) initiated in 2008 in the oxycline at approximately 320m depth, and the Oxygen Supply Tracer Release Experiment (OSTRE) initiated in 2012 in the core of the OMZ at approximately 410m depth. The mean diapycnal diffusivity Dz was found to be insignificantly smaller in the OMZ core with (1.06±0.24)×10−5m2s−1 compared to (1.11±0.22)×10−5m2s−1 90m shallower in the oxycline. Unexpectedly, GUTRE tracer was detected during two of the OSTRE surveys which showed that the estimated diapycnal diffusivity from GUTRE over a time period of seven years was within the uncertainty of the previous estimates over a time period of three years. The results are consistent with the Dz estimates from microstructure measurements and demonstrate that Dz does not vary significantly vertically in the OMZ within the depth range of 200–600m and does not change with time. The presence of a seamount chain in the vicinity of the GUTRE injection region did not cause enhanced Dz compared to the smoother bottom topography of the OSTRE injection region, although the analysis of vertical shear spectra from ship ADCP data showed elevated internal wave energy level in the seamount vicinity. However, the two tracer patches covered increasingly overlapping areas with time and thus spatially integrated increasingly similar fields of local diffusivity, as well as the difference in local stratification counteracted the influence of roughness on Dz. For both experiments no significant vertical displacements of the tracer were observed, thus diapycnal upwelling within the ETNA OMZ is below the uncertainty level of 5myr−1.","Tropical Atlantic,Guinea Dome,Tracers,Diffusion coefficients,Upwelling,Oxygen minimum zone,Ventilation,"

"graph-based ship traffic partitioning for intelligent maritime surveillance in complex port waters","2023","Maritime Situational Awareness (MSA) is a critical component of intelligent maritime traffic surveillance. However, it becomes increasingly challenging to gain MSA accurately given the growing complexity of ship traffic patterns due to multi-ship interactions possibly involving classical manned ships and emerging autonomous ships. This study proposes a new traffic partitioning methodology to realise the optimal maritime traffic partition in complex waters. The methodology combines conflict criticality and spatial distance to generate conflict-connected and spatially compact traffic clusters, thereby improving the interpretability of traffic patterns and supporting ship anti-collision risk management. First, a composite similarity measure is designed using a probabilistic conflict detection approach and a newly formulated maritime traffic route network learned through maritime knowledge mining. Then, an extended graph-based clustering framework is used to produce balanced traffic clusters with high intra-connections but low inter-connections. The proposed methodology is thoroughly demonstrated and tested using Automatic Identification System (AIS) trajectory data in the Ningbo-Zhoushan Port. The experimental results show that the proposed methodology 1) has effective performance in decomposing the traffic complexity, 2) can assist in identifying high-risk/density traffic clusters, and 3) is sufficiently generic to handle various traffic scenarios in complex geographical waters. Therefore, this study makes significant contributions to intelligent maritime surveillance and provides a theoretical foundation for promoting maritime anti-collision risk management for the future mixed traffic of both manned and autonomous ships.","Graph partitioning,Intelligent maritime surveillance,Maritime safety,Maritime knowledge extraction,AIS data,"
"an integrated dynamic ship risk model based on bayesian networks and evidential reasoning","2021","The paper proposes a probabilistic framework for assessing the risk of ships based on a hybrid approach and multiple data sources. A Bayes-based network learning approach uses data from the New Inspection Regime of the Paris MoU on Port State Control to characterise the relationships among risk parameters and uses these parameters to evaluate the ship static risk. Other data sources are used to develop a Bayesian Network model to assess the dynamic risk of the ship. The data is aggregated by Bayesian Network and Evidential Reasoning approaches to evaluate the overall risk of ships in coastal waters. The objective of the study is to develop a model to assess the risk of an individual ship by considering its static risk profile and the geographical-dependant risk factors related to the characteristics of the maritime traffic flow and other local characteristics that influence the navigational risk of the ship. The results show that the integrated approach is able to assess the overall risk of a ship based on multiple data sources, providing empirical evidence of using multiple data sources in risk analysis applications. Moreover, the developed model identifies the most critical circumstances and the key impact factors in the study waters, which can support decisions on risk prevention and mitigation measures and local maritime traffic management.","Evidential Reasoning,Rule-based approach,Static and dynamic ship risk,Bayesian Networks,Automatic identification system data,Port State Control inspection data,Maritime risk analysis,"

"the utility of body size indices derived from optical plankton counter data for the characterization of marine zooplankton assemblages","2012","To evaluate the utility of size-based indices derived from an Optical Plankton Counter (OPC) through detection of spatial and temporal trends in zooplankton biomass, zooplankton size data were collected with an OPC across the Scotian Shelf region of the northwest Atlantic Ocean in April and October of 1997, 1998, and 1999. Eight size-based indices were computed – three simple size metrics (arithmetic mean, geometric mean, coefficient of variation) and metrics derived from the Normalized Biomass Size Spectrum (NBSS; X- and Y-coordinates and curvature of a fitted quadratic function) and the Pareto distribution (Y-intercept and slope). Results indicate that the simple size indices and those derived from the Pareto distribution consistently accounted for the greatest portion of annual variation in zooplankton biomass whereas indices derived from the NBSS accounted only for some secondary patterns. Simple indices also accounted for the greatest portion of spatial variance in zooplankton biomass whereas the NBSS and Pareto accounted for secondary patterns. Patterns in zooplankton communities based on these indices reflected broad taxonomic trends and were related to independent observations on atmospheric and hydrographic conditions in the study area. Size-based zooplankton data from continuous survey instruments can provide powerful adjuncts to both freshwater and marine aquatic monitoring.","Pareto distribution,Optical Plankton Counter,Zooplankton,Body-size index,Scotian Shelf,Size spectrum,"
"a geospatial hub to support wind energy and maritime activity spaces near hampton roads, virginia, u.s.a.","2022","The urgent need for clean, sustainable energy development prompts the Commonwealth of Virginia (U.S.A.) to support the development of wind energy in state and federal waters. The port of Hampton Roads is a vital region for maritime commerce, recreation, and national defense, and the state also aims to avert wind development impacts on national security. This project assessed the state of marine geodata portals and decisionsupport methods for wind energy siting and developed a solution to inform energy developers, military stakeholders, and state and local government. An interdisciplinary team developed a user experience (UX) design approach to the problem, gathering persona-driven requirements and designing, prototyping, and testing a solution. Extensive geospatial wind resource data, energy infrastructure, shore and maritime air and vessel activity, protected lands, energy grid connections, and administrative processes are integrated in a web-based solution to screen and assess compatibility. This paper highlights Geographic Information Systems (GIS) used to provide decision support for site suitability analysis of offshore wind energy potential. With a focus on military use spaces, the project sought to gather publicly available activity spaces and areas of critical concern to military siting. We also integrated the newest available maritime vessel traffic activity from AIS data. A user-driven design is applied with GIS data that incorporates the diverse variability of energy, jurisdictional, and potential activity use space conflicts of an increasingly busy maritime environment. The approach taken in this project demonstrates that UX can support the range of developers, regulators, and maritime space users. The WindsiteVA hub spans onshore as well as offshore and nearshore (state waters and the Chesapeake Bay). Spatial analyses include several webmap capabilities, a library of basemaps, site exploration and coordinate conversion tools, reporting tools, and metadata and external data resources. Users are guided through pathways unique to personas: Developers, government agency personnel, or military personnel. As a â€œone-stop toolâ€ the webbased site is accessible publicly and utilizes Esri ArcGIS Hub technology. The site steps users through critical processes and data elements, such as informal queries, Notice of Proposed Construction for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), VA Department of Environmental Quality Permit by Rule (PBR), the US Department of Defense siting clearinghouse, and other procedures. Results suggest improved spatial decision-making and marine spatial planning can be achieved at minimal cost by combining UX design and geospatial hub technology. Wind resource development around seaports can be optimized and spatial conflicts reduced, costs lowered, and cumulative impacts identified. WindSiteVA captures complex processes and major concerns for wind energy availability and military concerns, yet it is not redundant with other policies or rules nor does it reflect sitescale reviews such as environmental impact assessments.

"anomaly detection in maritime domain based on spatio-temporal analysis of ais data using graph neural networks","2021","One of the critical applications of trajectory mining is Event Detection, where an automatized task identifies the deviation of a vesselâ€™s movement from its standard route. Conventionally, Origin-Destination matrix data is utilized for event detection which has limitations such as removal of temporal aspect of data and inability to access to trajectory features such as speed of vessel from origin to destination. To utilize aforementioned features available in Automatic information system (AIS), we formulate the problem in a novel way, by detecting anomalies in a set of directed graphs representing the movement pattern at each time interval. We further propose Graph Network Deviation Detector (GNDD), which leverages graph embedding and context embedding techniques to capture anomalies in the spatio-temporal patterns of movement. Extensive experiments applied on five real-world AIS datasets show that our method achieved promising results in identifying abnormal movements.","Graph neural networks,critical applications,data mining,graph embedding,event detection,Automatic information system,Anomaly detection,matrix algebra,Graph Network Deviation Detector,abnormal movements,Origin-Destination matrix data,Feature extraction,movement pattern,neural nets,Directed graphs,temporal aspect,marine systems,automatized task,Signal processing,maritime domain,directed graphs,Artificial intelligence,trajectory mining,standard route,graph theory,anomaly Detection,Spatiotemporal graph embeddings,real-world AIS datasets,spatio-temporal analysis,Trajectory,trajectory features,aforementioned features,Event detection,AIS data,"
"enterprise resilience and sustainability for operations of maritime container ports","2019","Recent trends in markets, technologies, demographics, regulations, organizations, energy, and environments require adaptations for operations of container ports. This paper describes resilience of ports to emergent conditions in three areas: Energy and fuels, controls and automation, and logistics transformation. First, the sustainability of energy and fuels have become a priority for ports due to growing concerns of carbon emissions. Liquified natural gas (LNG) is both a cost-effective and safe alternative fuel for reducing emissions of container ships. The feasibility and several strategies for adopting LNG bunkering at ports are described. Second, ports must leverage technological development to drive greater efficiency and operative resiliency. Recent developments in industrial automation and electrification are described. Lastly, the impact of corporate development to the region of the port is discussed. An analysis of enterprise capacity expansion includes both risks and benefits to increase competitiveness. This paper uses methodology of systems and data analysis, mathematical simulation, and risk cost-benefit optimization. The key results include identifying operational and security risks for container ports and providing strategies for risk mitigation and resilience. The recommendations are discussed in context of a USD $750 million ten-year strategic plan of a major container port on the Atlantic Coast of the United States.","sustainability,enterprise resilience,maritime container ports,sustainable development,United States,logistics systems,Atlantic Coast,electrification,Industries,Marine vehicles,cost-benefit analysis,logistics transformation,Resilience,industrial automation,data analysis,Liquefied natural gas,Containers,logistics,ships,safe alternative fuel,liquified natural gas,natural gas technology,optimisation,strategic planning,sea ports,container port,container ships,risk analysis,mathematical analysis,risk mitigation,risk cost-benefit optimization,Batteries,mathematical simulation,Systems engineering,"

"variability and change in the west antarctic peninsula marine system: research priorities and opportunities","2019","The west Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) region has undergone significant changes in temperature and seasonal ice dynamics since the mid-twentieth century, with strong impacts on the regional ecosystem, ocean chemistry and hydrographic properties. Changes to these long-term trends of warming and sea ice decline have been observed in the 21st century, but their consequences for ocean physics, chemistry and the ecology of the high-productivity shelf ecosystem are yet to be fully established. The WAP shelf is important for regional krill stocks and higher trophic levels, whilst the degree of variability and change in the physical environment and documented biological and biogeochemical responses make this a model system for how climate and sea ice changes might restructure high-latitude ecosystems. Although this region is arguably the best-measured and best-understood shelf region around Antarctica, significant gaps remain in spatial and temporal data capable of resolving the atmosphere-ice-ocean-ecosystem feedbacks that control the dynamics and evolution of this complex polar system. Here we summarise the current state of knowledge regarding the key mechanisms and interactions regulating the physical, biogeochemical and biological processes at work, the ways in which the shelf environment is changing, and the ecosystem response to the changes underway. We outline the overarching cross-disciplinary priorities for future research, as well as the most important discipline-specific objectives. Underpinning these priorities and objectives is the need to better define the causes, magnitude and timescales of variability and change at all levels of the system. A combination of traditional and innovative approaches will be critical to addressing these priorities and developing a co-ordinated observing system for the WAP shelf, which is required to detect and elucidate change into the future.","Primary production,Physical oceanography,Southern Ocean,Ecosystems,Sea ice,Nutrient and carbon cycling,Antarctica,Climate change,West Antarctic Peninsula,"

We elaborate on how the detection of such deviations can be used for high-lighting suspected criminal behavior and activities. BPAD has previously been successively deployed and evaluated in several similar domains, including Maritime Domain Awareness, Train Fleet Maintenance, and Alarm filtering. Similar as for those applications, we argue in the paper that the deployment of BPAD in area of crime monitoring potentially can improve the situation awareness of criminal activities, by providing automatic detection of suspicious behaviors, and uncovering large scale patterns.","Anomaly detection,Bayes methods,Monitoring,Situation awareness,Data analysis,Image color analysis,behavioural sciences computing,geographically tagged alarm data,situation awareness improvement,Bayesian statistics,Bayesian parametric statistical anomaly detection method,criminal behavior trends,BPAD,Criminal behaviour,criminal behavior pattern,crime monitoring,suspected criminal behavior,suspicious behavior automatic detection,Market research,suspected criminal activities,Data collection,Data mining,police data processing,"
"experimental verification of ecological interface prototype issued by an automated generation tool","2015","Vicente and Rasmussen have developed a method called Ecological Interface Design (EID) in the field of cognitive engineering .[1] In this context, we proposed a software tool named Anaxagore, that can assist the EID process for a rapid implementation of user interface prototypes. In a first stage, models based on standardized structure-functional diagram are computed .[2] In a second stage, these diagrams as inputs are transformed through a model-driven engineering process, involving a library of ecological graphical representations and an interface background. Then, an ecological interface prototype can be generated. Previously, Anaxagore was used to generate conventional synoptic representation .[3] To validate its EID extended version, an experimental protocol has been established. The experiment was conducted at the National Maritime College, with 14 naval officers randomly divided into two groups according to the used interface. After a preliminary training of participants to the use of the interfaces, four scenarios were simulated during the experiment. For each scenario, the performance was evaluated by a success score and by measuring the time to detect and understand failure. With the EID interface generated by Anaxagore, faster detection time and better diagnosis accuracy were observed. Anaxagore seems to constitute a response for assisting the rapid prototyping of ecological interface.","automatic generation,ecological interface design,protyping,design,"
"maritime pattern extraction from ais data using a genetic algorithm","2016","The long term prediction of maritime vessels' destinations and arrival times is essential for making an effective logistics planning. As ships are influenced by various factors over a long period of time, the solution cannot be achieved by analyzing sailing patterns of each entity separately. Instead, an approach is required, that can extract maritime patterns for the area in question and represent it in a form suitable for querying all possible routes any vessel in that region can take. To tackle this problem we use a genetic algorithm (GA) to cluster vessel position data obtained from the publicly available Automatic Identification System (AIS). The resulting clusters are treated as route waypoints (WP), and by connecting them we get nodes and edges of a directed graph depicting maritime patterns. Since standard clustering algorithms have difficulties in handling data with varying density, and genetic algorithms are slow when handling large data volumes, in this paper we investigate how to enhance the genetic algorithm to allow fast and accurate waypoint identification. We also include a quad tree structure to preprocess data and reduce the input for the GA. When the route graph is created, we add post processing to remove inconsistencies caused by noise in the AIS data. Finally, we validate the results produced by the GA by comparing resulting patterns with known inland water routes for two Dutch provinces.","data mining,Clustering algorithms,Genetic algorithms,vessel position data cluster,marine navigation,directed graph,maritime pattern extraction,sailing pattern analysis,quadtrees,Biological cells,genetic algorithms,genetic algorithm,ships,Genetic Algorithms,automatic identification system,inland water routes,Dutch provinces,logistics planning,Automatic Identification System,quad tree structure,Data Mining,directed graphs,pattern clustering,Artificial intelligence,route querying,maritime vessel destination prediction,Pattern Recognition,Logistics,Synchromodal Logistics,long term prediction,route waypoints,Boats,logistics data processing,Data mining,AIS data,arrival time prediction,data handling,"

"obstacle avoidance and target search of an autonomous surface vehicle for 2016 maritime robotx challenge","2017","This paper describes algorithms for Autonomous Surface Vehicle(ASV) obstacle avoidance and target search task. This work is primarily designed for task mission of 2016 Maritime RobotX competition. In this task, ASV must avoid obstacle buoys, while it is searching for totem-shaped buoy. To deal with such problem, algorithms for both perception and motion planning stage was designed. In perception stage, 2D scanning LIDAR and monocular vision sensor are used to detect any floating objects on the water. To recognize target (totem buoy), HSV color space information was used. Detected object (both obstacle and totem buoy) information is tracked by using Kalman filter. In action planning stage, both deliberative and reflexive action [2] planning are designed. In deliberative action planning stage, based on the Kalman filter tracked obstacle information, a grid map can be generated. Using the grid map and A* search algorithm, desired path for searching totem can be calculated. In reflexive action planning stage, once ASV accidently enters hazardous region, where it has high probability of getting collide, it is designed to reflexively escape the region by making pure sway motion.

"assessing the range of radio maritime links in different waterbodies: effect of antenna height and band diversities","2021","In this paper, we analyze the weather information for 14 waterbodies from geographical areas with different meteorological characteristics. We estimate the sub-hourly instances of the evaporation duct height (EDH) throughout a period of 10 years. Then, considering the frequency range 1 to 6 GHz, based on the parabolic equation method, we analyze the quality for a presumed shore-to-ship link throughout 100 km range. We evaluate the maximum range that can be supported for different reliability requirements and we focus specifically on analyzing the gain that can be obtained when antenna height and/or band diversity are used. It was found that for high reliability requirements, the antenna height at the shore is the main factor on deciding the maximum communication range that can be maintained.

"optimising maritime processes via artificial intelligence: the vesselai concept and use cases","2022","The beginning of this decade finds artificial intelligence, high performance computing (HPC), and big data analytics in the forefront of digital transformation that is projected to heavily impact various industries and domains. Specifically, the maritime industry, which is already a relatively advanced area concerned to others could stand to gain great benefits from the combination and application of innovative technologies in its practices. This fact, combined with the amount of data generated from naval vessels and sensors points to the direction of AI and big data, two technologies that have the ability to absorb large amounts of data, process them and provide automated and optimised solutions for all maritime stakeholders. Integrating these technologies and tools in a unified system poses various challenges. Under this context, the current publication presents the concept and pilot use cases of VesselAI, an EU-funded project that aims to develop, validate and demonstrate a novel holistic framework based on a combination of the state-of-the-art HPC, Big Data and AI technologies, capable of performing extreme-scale and distributed analytics for fuelling the next-generation digital twins in maritime applications and beyond, including vessel motion and behaviour modelling, analysis and prediction, ship energy system design and optimisation, unmanned vessels, route optimisation and fleet intelligence.

"how maritime education and training (met) instructors address assessment protocol","2020","With the advent of more technologies being utilized on a modern Ships Navigational Bridge it is important to address all human elements that play a role in the safety of the vessel. Of these elements, the training of personal in the use of the ships modern equipment is imperative. To address this, the maritime industry both on the international and national levels implements a series of assessments to validate a potential officer's knowledge base. This study looks to identify the Maritime Bridge Simulators instructor's interpretation of the assessments done on a Navigation simulator. An Auto Ethnographic approach is utilized to highlight current and previous interactions with the former Mariners, who are now educators. These Maritime Education and Training (MET) instructors, who utilize a modern Full Mission Bridge Simulator, as they assess a navigational bridge team will be examined. The preliminary understanding and projected findings is that both the performance based assessment and the interactive assessments done on these simulators, inform teaching and enhance learning experiences. However, the assessments themselves which are mandated, are vague and unsuccessful in properly assessing a future Maritime Officer. As Mariners have all experienced some subject matter experts who may have all of the qualifications needed to teach, yet are incapable of doing so. On the other hand, some may not have mastery of the subject but are able to pass on the knowledge needed for one to succeed sufficiently. In a worst-case scenario, there are those who â€œcan neither do nor teach.â€ How can we prevent these instances from offering? Is there something within mandated regulations that can be used to avoid this from occurring? Could there be a cultural or societal aspect that we can use as a preventative means? These questions are difficult to answer. There is a need to be judged on many levels, as well as discussed and debated. Instructors in the Maritime industry are no different than the Instructors in other fields. They have all been exposed to the subject that they are required to teach, how they prepare and interpret the lessons needed is not always the same as one would think. Simulation as an educational tool has been used across a broad spectrum of subjects and industries. How these simulations are integrated within the classroom differs depending on the simulator. One of the main objectives of simulation is Project-Based learning. Simulations that encompass the Project-Based Learning design can be defined as complex tasks based on difficult questions. These situations provoke the student to design, implement problem-solving, and decision making processes. The fact-finding activities embedded in the simulation can provide students with situations where they need to work independently over significant periods. At the end of the simulation, there is a concluding event that emulates realistic products or situations [1]. In addition to the â€œProjectâ€ associated with this theory, there are other defining factors; these factors include authentic content, authentic assessment, teacher facilitation, and clear educational goals[2]. All of these play a significant role within the realm of Maritime Simulation. For a successful Simulation of a Ships Navigational bridge to occur, the preliminary understanding and projected findings is that the performance-based assessment and the interactive assessments done on these simulators, inform teaching and enhance learning experiences. In order to accomplish this, many challenges are facing the educators that operate these simulated exercises. The first challenge is the Professional Development of the educators. Unlike most professional educators, the requirements to teach within this field are limited. The students that these instructors teach also differ in that they are an older student. This method is called Andragogy. The way the instructor approaches this must be different from the Petrological approach of young students. The final challenge addressed here is the instructor's interpretation of both international and national regulations. By utilizing Authentic Assessment, educators need to cultivate a better understanding of the concept or subject taught and focus less on the improved learning outcomes associated with them [3].","international regulations,interactive assessments,Project-Based Learning,human elements,project-based learning design,Regulation,Andragogy,assessment protocol,MET Instructors,Industries,Marine vehicles,modern ships navigational bridge,potential officer,maritime simulation,Bridges,Instructor Training,educational courses,preliminary understanding,Mariners,Maritime Simulation,ships,Authentic Assessment,navigational bridge team,marine engineering,clear educational goals,international levels,educational tool,Auto Ethnographic approach,computer based training,decision making,Professional Development,modern Full Mission Bridge Simulator,ships modern equipment,simulated exercises,teaching,Maritime Education and Training,performance-based assessment,MET,subject matter experts,Performance-based Assessment,future maritime officer,professional educators,maritime industry,Navigation,Task analysis,performance based assessment,Tools,authentic assessment,learning experiences,maritime education and training instructors,navigation simulator,maritime bridge simulators instructor,"

"regional scale assessment of submarine groundwater discharge in ireland combining medium resolution satellite imagery and geochemical tracing techniques","2012","This paper sets the foundation for the use of freely available Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) thermal infrared (TIR) imagery in a regional scale assessment of submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) to coastal waters. A comprehensive, tiered, three-step approach is proposed as the most effective and affordable means to determine the spatial extent and scale of SGD from coastal aquifers to the coastal margin. As the preliminary step, Sea Surface Temperature (SST) values derived from Landsat ETM+ TIR are used to successfully detect plumes of colder water eventually associated with SGD in close proximity to the shoreline. Subsequently, potential sites of SGD are linked to geological features on land acting as possible sources, by combining within a Geographical Information System (GIS), mapped temperature anomalies with ancillary on-shore spatial datasets describing bedrock geology including aquifer fault lines. Finally, nearshore surveys mapping the activity of 222Rn (radon) and salinity are carried out to verify the presence of SGD and provide a qualitative assessment of fresh groundwater inputs to the coastal zone. Practical application of the complete approach in the context of coastal zone management is illustrated through a case-study of the Republic of Ireland. As part of this study, over 30 previously unidentified links between aquifers on land and the sea are shown along the Irish coast, hence illustrating the tight coupling between coastal waters and groundwater inputs at an unprecedented spatial scale. The study demonstrates the potential of the combined applications of remote sensing methods and geochemical tracing techniques for a cost-effective regional-scale assessment of groundwater discharge to coastal waters.","Radon,Landsat ETM+,Submarine groundwater discharge,Salinity,Thermal remote sensing,Geochemical tracing,"

"knowledge discovery using genetic algorithm for maritime situational awareness","2014","Due to the large volume of data related to vessels, to manually pore through and to analyze the information in a bid to identify potential maritime threat is tedious, if at all possible. This study aims to enhance maritime situational awareness through the use of computational intelligence techniques in detecting anomalies. A knowledge discovery system based on genetic algorithm termed as GeMASS was proposed and investigated in this research. In the development of GeMASS, a machine learning approach was applied to discover knowledge that is applicable in characterizing maritime security threats. Such knowledge is often implicit in datasets and difficult to discover by human analysts. As the knowledge relevant to maritime security may vary from time to time, GeMASS was specified to learn from streaming data and to generate up-to-date knowledge in a dynamic fashion. Based on the knowledge discovered, the system functions to screen vessels for anomalies in real-time. Traditionally in maritime security studies, datasets that are applied as knowledge sources are related to vessels’ geographical and movement information. This study investigated a novel leverage of multiple data sources, including Automatic Identification System, classification societies, and port management and security systems for the enhancement of maritime security. A prototype of GeMASS was developed and employed as a vehicle to study and demonstrate the functions of the proposed methodology.","Defense,Maritime security,Genetic algorithm,Knowledge discovery,Decision support,Machine learning,"

Adopting a geoarchaeological approach, the combination of sedimentological, palynological, and geophysical data enables the reconstruction of various stages in the landscape evolution of the Lower Sagone River over the last 4000years, together with the history of human occupation. The methods consist of a palaeoenvironmental study of 9 boreholes drilled in the modern deltaic plain, at a maximum distance of 500m from the present-day shoreline. The laboratory analyses included mollusk identification and measurements of the grain-size distribution (by wet sieving). A series of 21 radiocarbon dates on charcoal, plant remains, wood fragments, and marine mollusk samples formed the basis for a chronostratigraphy. In order to reconstruct the vegetation history of the catchment, with particular attention to anthropogenic activity, pollen analysis was conducted on clay samples from the deepest borehole, and they revealed a semi-open forest during the Bronze Age and Late Iron Age with extensive pastoral activity and limited cereal cultivation. Electric Resistivity Tomography (ERT) of 3 profiles across the alluvial plain was conducted in order to reveal the geometry of the sedimentary bodies. The salient features are the presence of a freshwater lake during the Mid- to Late Bronze Age (from 1500 to 1100cal. BCE), its transformation into an open marine bay from ca. 1100 until 500cal.

We use a combination of new and legacy analytical datasets (NAA and XRF), from excavated ceramics, to evaluate the potential compositional range of local resources (based on comparisons with sediments from within a 10 km site radius). Results show a clear distinction between sediment-defined local and non-local ceramic compositional groups. Two discrete local ceramic resources have been previously identified and we confirm a third local resource for a major class of EIA handmade wares and cooking pots. This third source appears to derive from a residual resource on the Troy peninsula (rather than adjacent alluvial valleys). The presence of a group of large and heavy pithoi among the non-local groups raises questions about their regional or maritime origin.","Local production,Bottom-up sampling,Macro-analysis,Multivariate analysis,Neutron Activation Analysis,Statistical power relationships,Legacy datasets,"
"risk evolution analysis of maritime traffic accidents in coastal areas of china","2023","The study of water traffic accidents can help to understand the causes and mechanisms of water accidents, so as to help reduce the occurrence of water accidents and improve the level of maritime safety management. Based on the investigation report of Chinaâ€™s coastal water traffic accidents, this study analyzes the risk evolution of water traffic accidents based on accident causation theory and complex network theory, and discusses the risk evolution characteristics of Chinaâ€™s coastal water traffic accidents from the stages of accident latency, diffusion and occurrence in combination with network topology characteristics. The research results show that ship collision is the main accident type of coastal water traffic in my country, and improper operation and human error are the key causes of accidents; accident evolution has obvious characteristics such as short transmission path and strong randomness, and the risk factors are interdependent; many Node failures are more likely to cause the system to crash, resulting in accidents.","evolution of risk,marine accidents,risk evolution characteristics,water accidents,Transportation,main accident type,accident evolution,Sea measurements,accident causation theory,accident prevention,complex network,ships,marine safety,coastal water traffic accidents,road accidents,maritime traffic accidents,risk management,Safety management,Complex networks,network theory (graphs),Water,risk analysis,maritime accident,risk evolution analysis,complex networks,Navigation,accidents,water transportation safety,Analytical models,"
"palaeomagnetism and magnetic anisotropy of carboniferous red beds from the maritime provinces of canada: evidence for shallow palaeomagnetic inclinations and implications for north american apparent polar wander","2010","A palaeomagnetic and magnetic anisotropy study was conducted on the lower-middle Carboniferous Maringouin and Shepody red bed formations of the Maritime Provinces of Canada to detect and correct inclination shallowing. Because of the shallow inclinations commonly observed in red beds and the strong dependence of North America's Palaeo-Mesozoic apparent polar wander (APW) on red beds, inclination shallowing may substantially affect large portions of North America's APW path. Hematite is the primary magnetic mineral carrier in these red beds, accompanied by secondary magnetite, maghemite, goethite and pigmentary hematite. Thermal and chemical demagnetization of the Shepody Fm. successfully isolated characteristic remanence directions of D= 177Â°, I= 20.4Â°, Î±95= 6.5Â°, N= 19 and D= 177.8Â°I= 17.7Â°, Î±95= 6.9Â°, N= 16, respectively. Thermal demagnetization of the Maringouin Fm. isolated a characteristic remanence direction of D= 178.7Â°, I= 24.9Â°, Î±95= 14.5Â°, N= 9.High field anisotropy of isothermal remanence followed by alternating field and thermal cleaning on leached samples was used to isolate the fabric of hematite. Individual particle anisotropy was measured directly from magnetic separates using a new technique. Hematite's magnetic fabric and particle anisotropy were used to apply an inclination correction. Our inclination corrections indicate up to 10Â° of inclination shallowing, corresponding to corrected palaeopole positions of 27.2Â°N, 118.3Â°E, A95= 6.2Â° and 27.4Â°N, 117.2Â°E, A95= 13.1Â° for the Shepody and Maringouin formations, respectively. This correction corresponds to a âˆ¼ 6Â° increase in colatitude for Carboniferous North America, which translates into approximately a 650 km change in North America's palaeogeographic position. The proposed position of North America supports a Pangea B-type reconstruction.","Palaeomagnetism applied to Tectonics,Magnetic mineralogy and petrology,Palaeomagnetism applied to geologic processes,Magnetic fabrics and anisotropy,Rock and mineral magnetism,"
"maritime linked data for situational awareness heterogeneous sensor networks","2021","Maritime heterogeneous sensor networks (HSN), which are widely used in support of marine monitoring, maritime security and safety applications, combine diversified sensing systems and platforms observing the state of environmental features of interest or the status of anthropogenic objects to achieve awareness on the situation. To model the information characteristics of HSN observations for maritime situational awareness (MSA), we developed the MSA-HSN ontology, an integrated semantic model for maritime linked data, specifically observations suiting the requirements of maritime information fusion systems. MSA-HSN integrates established ontologies and models for sensors, observations, measurements, quantities, and occurrents, tailored to MSA applications and requirements. To support the interoperability with existing maritime data models, MSA-HSN is aligned with the relevant aspects of the EUCISE/e-CISE (Common Information Sharing Environment) data models. As a validation use case, in this paper the MSA-HSN ontology is applied to model the information elements of the maritime surveillance system developed within the Interactive Extreme-Scale Analytics and Forecasting (INFORE) project, where different situational views offered by a variegate suite of sensors and platforms are fused using big data analytics to achieve maritime situational awareness for maritime security. The paper describes the design of the MSA-HSN ontology, illustrating its application through examples taken from the INFORE use case and from relevant datasets developed by recent European projects involving MSA use cases.","Heterogeneous Sensor Network (HSN),Semantics,information characteristics,Linked data,Occurrents,Maritime Security,safety applications,maritime surveillance system,maritime data models,HSN observations,maritime security,Sea measurements,integrated semantic model,situational awareness heterogeneous sensor networks,MSA applications,common information sharing environment,Information Quality,maritime situational awareness,MSA-HSN ontology,maritime information fusion systems,data analysis,Maritime Surveillance,wireless sensor networks,Ontology,Oceans,Data models,different situational views,European projects,Maritime Situational Awareness (MSA),MSA use cases,maritime heterogeneous sensor networks,Knowledge Graph,ontologies (artificial intelligence),marine monitoring,big data analytics,Maritime Linked Data,Big Data,MSA Ontology,Java,Ontologies,maritime linked data,marine communication,video surveillance,Maritime Events,INFORE project,interactive extreme-scale analytics and forecasting,"
"maritime traffic route detection framework based on statistical density analysis from ais data using a clustering algorithm","2022","Maritime traffic routes by ships navigation vary according to country and geographic characteristics, and they differ according to the characteristics of the ships. In ocean areas adjacent to coasts, regulated routes are present, e.g., traffic separation scheme for ships entering and leaving; however, most ocean areas do not have such routes. Maritime traffic route research has been conducted based on computer engineering to create routes; however, ship characteristics were not considered. Thus, this article proposes a framework to generate maritime traffic routes using statistical density analysis. Here, automatic identification system (AIS) data are used to derive quantitative traffic routes. Preprocessing is applied to the AIS data, and a similar ship trajectory pattern is decomposed into a matrix based on the Hausdorffâ€“distance algorithm and then stored in a database. A similar pattern makes the AIS trajectory simple using the Douglasâ€“Peucker algorithm. In addition, density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) is performed to identify the waypoints of vessels then create routes by connecting waypoints. The width of maritime routes created based on a similar ship trajectory is subjected to kernel density estimation analysis (KDE). Then, waypoints evaluation of the main route is performed from the results of KDE 75% and 90% considering the statistical in the total maritime traffic, and the results applied to the targeted ocean area are compared. Finally, the result of KDE 90% of maritime traffic with framework analyzed the safety route, which can be a basis for developing routes for maritime autonomous surface ships.","traffic separation scheme,ocean areas,marine accidents,Clustering algorithms,Safety,targeted ocean area,Douglas-Peucker algorithm,automatic identification system data,vehicle routing,total maritime traffic,Marine vehicles,maritime autonomous surface ships,quantitative traffic routes,geographic characteristics,DBSCAN,statistical analysis,ships,marine safety,kernel density estimation,AIS trajectory simple,maritime traffic route detection framework,kernel density estimation analysis,Oceans,Hausdorff-distance algorithm,ship trajectory pattern,framework,pattern clustering,Artificial intelligence,statistical density analysis,marine engineering computing,Trajectory,ship characteristics,maritime traffic route research,Navigation,safety route,density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise,clustering algorithm,AIS data,maritime traffic route,"
"toward the automated construction of probabilistic knowledge graphs for the maritime domain","2021","International maritime crime is becoming increasingly sophisticated, often associated with wider criminal networks. Detecting maritime threats by means of fusing data purely related to physical movement (i.e., those generated by physical sensors, or hard data) is not sufficient. This has led to research and development efforts aimed at combining hard data with other types of data (especially human-generated or soft data). Existing work often assumes that input soft data is available in a structured format, or is focused on extracting certain relevant entities or concepts to accompany or annotate hard data. Much less attention has been given to extracting the rich knowledge about the situations of interest implicitly embedded in the large amount of soft data existing in unstructured formats (such as intelligence reports and news articles). In order to exploit the potentially useful and rich information from such sources, it is necessary to extract not only the relevant entities and concepts, but also their semantic relations, together with the uncertainty associated with the extracted knowledge (i.e., in the form of probabilistic knowledge graphs). This will increase the accuracy of, and confidence in, the extracted knowledge and facilitate subsequent reasoning and learning. To this end, we propose Maritime DeepDive, an initial prototype for the automated construction of probabilistic knowledge graphs from natural language data for the maritime domain. In this paper, we report on the current implementation of Maritime DeepDive, together with preliminary results on extracting probabilistic events from maritime piracy incidents. This pipeline was evaluated on a manually crafted gold standard, yielding promising results.","Semantics,Pipelines,data mining,criminal networks,physical sensors,Maritime DeepDive,Information Extraction,data fusion,natural language processing,physical movement,Maritime,maritime piracy incidents,maritime threats,probabilistic knowledge graphs,hard data,marine safety,international maritime crime,Probabilistic logic,maritime domain,Knowledge Graph,Prototypes,graph theory,uncertainty handling,Robustness,marine engineering computing,criminal law,Relation Extraction,inference mechanisms,knowledge extraction,Uncertainty,Sensors,learning (artificial intelligence),natural language data,DeepDive,probabilistic event extraction,"
"geochemistry and petrology of witwatersrand and dwyka diamictites from south africa: search for an extraterrestrial component","2001","Diamictites are poorly sorted sediments characteristically carrying coarse-grained clasts in a fine-grained matrix. They have generally been considered of glaciogenic or glaciomarine origin. Recently, however, it has been suggested that some massive tillite/diamictite layers could represent impact breccias. An earlier petrographic study of rock and mineral clasts from Dwyka Group diamictites revealed no evidence for shock metamorphism, such as planar deformation features. Detailed geochemical studies of diamictite samples from the Archean Witwatersrand Supergroup and the Dwyka Group of the Mesozoic Karoo Supergroup from South Africa are reported. We studied the contents of the siderophile elements in these breccias, as elevated abundances of such elements, especially iridium, could be indicative for an impact origin. By use of γ-γ coincidence spectrometry and other trace element analysis, geochemical tracers of extraterrestrial components were sought. However, no enrichments of indicator elements for extraterrestrial components, compared with ordinary continental crust, were found. Thus, neither geochemical nor petrographic evidence supports an impact origin of the diamictites from the Dwyka Group and the Witwatersrand Supergroup in South Africa.",""
"variability of lightning activity in south/southeast asia during 1997–98 and 2002–03 el nino/la nina events","2012","Impacts of the 1997–98 and 2002–03 ENSOs on total number of flashes and number of flash days from the LIS (Lightning Imaging Sensor) on board the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission satellite and on the average flash rate from the combined OTD (Optical Transient Detector) / LIS data are studied in South/Southeast Asia (8° –30°N, 60°–120°E) for the period 1998–2005. Also examined is the difference between the geographical distributions of these parameters in the El Nino period in 1998 and in the corresponding normal period in 1999. During the 1997–98 ENSO event, the number of flashes and average flash rate increase by 12% and 36%, respectively, during the El Nino period and during the La Nina period decrease by 22% and 5%, respectively, as compared to the corresponding normal periods. Similarly, during the 2002–2003 ENSO event, the number of flashes and average flash rate increase by 28% and 5% during the El Nino period in 2002 as compared to the corresponding normal period. The contrast in lightning activity between the El Nino and La Nina periods is more pronounced in Southeast Asia than in South Asia because of the southeastward shift in the convection activity during the ENSO events. In both regions, however, monthly variations of both total number of flashes and average flash rate are almost parallel to that of surface temperature. Although, the inverse relationship between the Indian Summer Monsoon Rainfall (ISMR) and El Nino broke down in 1997–98, the relationship between the El Nino and lightning maintains its normal increasing trend, indicating that the lightning activity is more sensitive to the convective activity than to rainfall on seasonal time scale. The total number of flashes and aerosol loading increase in the break‐period regime as compared to the monsoonal regime. The number of flash days in both ENSO events is higher in the EL Nino phase and lower in the La Nina phase as compared to their normal values in the subsequent years. Enhancement of lightning activity is mostly concentrated over land areas. Our results show that although diurnal variations in lightning activity can be related to the variations in surface temperature, convective adjustment induced by the corresponding ENSO phase needs to be considered for explaining the lightning activity variations on these longer time scales.","ENSO impact,South/Southeast Asia,El Nino impact,Lightning activity,"
"a preliminary model for maritime accident analysis by using functional resonance analysis method (fram)","2021","With the melting of sea ice, the Arctic region attracts a large number of tourists due to its unique geographical location and abundant tourism resources. The ship tourism business scale in the Arctic region continues to expand. However, there are more ship incidents/accidents in Arctic waters with the increase of ship activities. There is a requirement to make the safety management of passenger ships in Arctic operations. This paper focuses on the accident scenario analysis in Arctic shipping. The functional resonance analysis method (FRAM) systematically analyzes ship scenario accidents in Arctic waters by transforming accident-related events into interrelated functional modules and studying the mechanism of accidents from the perspective of functional characteristics.

"multiple oceanographic hf surface-wave radars applied to maritime surveillance","2014","In the context of maritime surveillance, low-power high-frequency surface-wave (HFSW) radars are attracting significant attention as cost-effective tools for long-range ship detection and tracking applications. In this paper, multi-target tracking and data fusion techniques are applied to live-recorded data from a network of three oceanographic HFSW radars installed on the coast of the German Bight, in the North Sea. This campaign follows a previous one conducted in 2009, in which two HFSW radars were deployed on the coast of the Ligurian Sea, in the Mediterranean. Ship reports from the automatic identification system, recorded from a number of coastal stations, are exploited as ground truth information. A methodology is then applied to classify the fused tracks and to estimate single-sensor and data fusion performances. Both in situ and model data are used to investigate the capabilities of the systems according to the variations of the meteorological and oceanographic conditions.

"anomaly detection in maritime data based on geometrical analysis of trajectories","2015","Anomaly detection is an important use of the Automatic Identification Systems (AIS), because it offers support to users to evaluate if a vessel is in trouble or causing trouble. For instance, it can be used to detect if a ship is doing something that may cause an accident or if it has changed its route to avoid bad weather condition. In this work, a new method for finding anomalies in the ships' movements is proposed. The method analyzes the trajectory of ships from a geometrical perspective. The trajectory of the ship is compared with a near-optimal path that is generated by a graph search algorithm. The proposed method extracts some scale-invariant features from the real trajectory and also from the optimal movement pattern, and it compares the two sets of features to generate an abnormality score. The method is unsupervised and it does not require training. Instead of labeling the trajectories as normal/abnormal it calculates a score value that denotes the extent of abnormality. The scoring scheme provides a ranking system in which the user can sort the trajectories based on their abnormality score. This is useful when dealing with large number of trajectories and the user wants to picks the most abnormal cases. For the evaluation, the method was run on three months data of North Pacific Ocean and score values were generated. Among the entire dataset, 100 randomly chosen trajectories were labeled by an expert. After applying a threshold on the score value, the proposed method had 94% accuracy.","maritime data,Clustering algorithms,randomly chosen trajectories,optimal movement pattern,anomaly detection,North Pacific Ocean,Marine vehicles,abnormality score,Mathematical model,Feature extraction,geometrical trajectories analysis,scale-invariant features,ships,marine engineering,bad weather condition,AIS,Oceans,near-optimal path,ship trajectory,ship movements,graph theory,graph search algorithm,Joining processes,score values,search problems,Trajectory,automatic identification systems,"
"a data mining method to extract traffic network for maritime transport management","2023","Maritime traffic network is essential for navigation efficiency and safety of the maritime transport system. This study proposes a framework for extracting maritime traffic network based on Automatic Identification System (AIS) data. The framework consists of maritime traffic pattern recognition, semantic routes extraction, route decomposition, and network generation. Firstly, a data-driven method is introduced to recognize ship behavior patterns and extends the single ship behaviors to regional characteristics to determine the departure-arrival areas. Then, based on the different combination of departure-arrival areas, the ship trajectories are classified to traffic groups. Subsequently, the grid-system is used to rasterize each traffic group, which realizes the fusion of trajectory data and geographic location information. Finally, to obtain the main routes and navigation channels, the extraction method is introduced by establishing the cumulative grid importance function. The main routes, together with the navigation channels, compose the maritime traffic network. The method is applied to AIS data in the Beibu Gulf, and the results show that the traffic network contains 12 stop areas, 4 entry/exit locations, 13 main routes as well as their corresponding navigation channels. It is therefore concluded that the proposed method helps (1) provide a theoretical framework to obtain and analyze the maritime traffic network and (2) enrich navigation channel identification methods for maritime transport management.","Maritime traffic network,Maritime transport management,AIS,Machine learning,Big data analytics,"

"measurement campaign and mathematical model construction for the ship zodiak magnetic signature reproduction","2021","The paper presents the partial work done within the framework of the EDA Siramis II project focused on magnetic signature reproduction of ships. Reproduction is understood here as the ability to determine the magnetic anomaly of the local Earth magnetic field in any direction and at any measurement depth due to the presence of the analysed object. The B-91 type hydrographic ship Zodiak was selected as the real case study. The work was divided into two main stages: the development of a measurement campaign taking into account physical measurements, and the development of a mathematical model on the basis of the measured values. The measurement campaign included: preparation of the measuring range, selection of equipment for the measurement of magnetic quantities and geographical location, and data recording while the ship passes the measuring point according to the designated course. As a result of the measurement campaign, magnetic flux density components were collected in different positions in relation to the measuring instruments and the ship's heading. A multi-dipole model was used to build the mathematical model in accordance with the idea of inverse modelling. The effectiveness of this model was previously checked on synthetic data of virtual ships generated using the finite element method. Experiments performed with simulation models were helpful in determining the structure of the model, the nature of the data, and the number of samples needed to properly determine the multi-dipole model parameters. The parameters were determined using the nonlinear least squares method according to the idea of data fitting. The classical Ridge and Lasso regularization methods were applied to prevent the developed multi-dipole model from overfitting. Other regularization methods based on GPS accuracy marks and modification of fitness functions were also considered. The verification was done using real data: the data generated by the model was compared with patterns recorded during the Zodiak measurement campaign. High degree of conformity of the shape of characteristics was obtained. Moreover, the correctness of model execution was confirmed by low values of quantitative indices such as RMSE and MAE representing modelling errors. The methodology presented in the paper is quite universal and can be used to determine the signatures of other ferromagnetic objects.","Sea measurements,Magnetic anomaly detection,Magnetic variables measurement,Magnetic signatures,Model checking,Electromagnetic modelling,Marine vehicles,Magnetic fields,"
"permeability and voids influence on the thermal signal, as inferred by multitemporal uav-based infrared and visible images","2020","This work presents for the first time associated thermal anomalies and deformations over subsurface cavities/voids located within two harbour quays in Le Havre Harbourg, Normandy, France. An U.A.V. (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) was used to acquire visible and thermal images over a diurnal cycle (from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m.). The visible images were processed to realize an altimetric model of the platforms by mean of the photogrammetric method, while the thermal infrared (TIR) images were used to study the evolution of their surface temperatures. The obtained 3D model shows the location of five topographic depressions on both quays. The analysis of the evolution of the surface thermal field leads to the detection of cold thermal anomalies that are (1) not correlated to surface properties, and (2) spatially associated to the flanks of the five topographic depressions. Using a 2D conductive-radiative model, we show that these anomalies are not directly due to the thermally insulating effect of an air-filled area. Finally, we conclude that preferential infiltration and subsequent evaporation in the micro-fracturation present within the flanks of the depressions may be responsible for the strong cooling of these zones.","Thermal infrared,Photogrammetry,Remote Sensing,infiltration,Subsurface cavity,Natural hazards,UAV,"

"insights from archaeological analysis and interpretation of marine data sets to inform marine cultural heritage management and planning of wave and tidal energy development for orkney waters and the pentland firth, ne scotland","2014","The Orkney archipelago has a rich heritage that includes the Heart of Neolithic Orkney World Heritage Site, Viking settlements, harbours supplying Hudson's Bay Company ships, and the wartime naval base of Scapa Flow. This rich history has left its mark on the seabed but accurate maps showing the location and character of surviving seabed archaeology do not exist to the same extent as for archaeology on land. ORCA Marine was commissioned by Historic Scotland to work with the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland in interrogating marine data sets to enhance historic environment records of Orkney Waters and the Pentland Firth. These waters were prioritised for their history of maritime activity and to help guide planning and developments in an area highlighted by the Scottish Government for marine renewable energy. A variety of recent and legacy datasets, including wreck databases; sonar data gathered by public sector bodies; aerial photography; seabed cores; Admiralty charts; and local knowledge, were examined for their effectiveness in discovering and interpreting marine cultural heritage cost-effectively. A methodology was developed that enabled marine cultural heritage information to be quickly assimilated within the national and regional inventories for dissemination online. Polygonisation of records resulted in GIS-based shapefiles identifying site extents, and areas of archaeological potential in relation to wrecks, submerged prehistoric landscapes, anchorages and fishing areas. Substantial gaps in data coverage were identified and areas of the seabed have been surveyed at resolutions that are sufficient to detect large upstanding remains such as iron shipwrecks but insufficient to identify smaller archaeological features. Other geophysical datasets have been created at a resolution detailed enough to allow the recognition of smaller anomalies but in some cases processing of the data has removed small anomalies of interest to archaeologists. Intensively used marine areas often contain the most artefactual remains such as historic ports being developed to service the marine renewable industry. Zones of high wave and tidal energy favoured for renewable energy devices include navigation channels and hazards where a large number of wrecks are documented. Transmission cable routes cross deep water where 20th-century wartime losses occurred. Planning and development of infrastructure relating to renewables may also interact with significant built heritage and archaeology on the foreshore and coast edge.",""

We focus on the Plio-Quaternary landscape evolution of the eastern part of the Ligurian Alps with the goal of defining the active tectonics through an analysis of topography, drainage networks, and river long profiles. The Ligurian Alps have a steep, seaward-facing escarpment with topographic features reminiscent of the geomorphic markers preserved on both actively-uplifting coastlines and passive margins. For example, there are seaward-facing benches that are thought to be uplifted marine terraces common to active margins; but the drainage divide of the seaward escarpment shows clear evidence of recent northward migration into the Po foreland, a process consistent with escarpment retreat characteristic of passive or subsiding margins. This study explores the active tectonics consistent with these diverse landscape evolution pathways. Our analysis reveals that rock-type strongly throttles the development of topographic relief, drainage networks, and northward migration of the drainage divide. However, we also identify segments of the escarpment that indicate recent base level falls through an analysis of modeled channel steepness and comparison with mean hillslope gradient. The base level falls are consistent with numerous barbed tributaries that are best explained as recent stream captures. No significant correlation among the stream captures at the drainage divide, suspected marine terraces at the coast, Ligurian Sea bathymetry, and active seismicity indicates that the escarpment is the footwall of a segmented normal fault. This normal fault is embedded in a regionally subsiding margin where actively uplifting segments lead to a straightened, pinned drainage divide, whereas, relatively inactive segments permit divide migration into the footwall block. These results are broadly consistent with rock uplift increasing eastward toward Genova across the long-suspected Alps–Apennine Sestri–Voltaggio fault zone. They highlight the respective roles of legacy structures, rock-type, and localized rock uplift in constructing a landscape in an otherwise extending and subsiding crustal retrowedge of an active subduction plate boundary.","Tectonic geomorphology,DEM analysis,Ligurian Alps,River longitudinal profile,"
"multi-scale collision risk estimation for maritime traffic in complex port waters","2023","Ship collision risk estimation is an essential component of intelligent maritime surveillance systems. Traditional risk estimation approaches, which can only analyze traffic risk in one specific scale, reveal a significant challenge in quantifying the collision risk of a traffic scenario from different spatial scales. This is detrimental to understanding the traffic situations and supporting effective anti-collision decision-making, particularly as maritime traffic complexity grows and autonomous ships emerge. In this study, a systematic multi-scale collision risk estimation approach is newly developed to capture traffic conflict patterns under different spatial scales. It extends the application of the complex network theory and a node deletion method to quantify the interactions and dependencies among multiple ships within encounter scenarios, enabling collision risk to be evaluated at any spatial scale. Meanwhile, an advanced graph-based clustering framework is introduced to search for the optimal spatial scales for risk evaluation. Extensive numerical experiments based on AIS data in Ningbo_Zhoushan Port are implemented to evaluate the model performance. Experimental results reveal that the proposed approach can strengthen maritime situational awareness, identify high-risk areas and support strategic maritime safety management. This work therefore sheds light on improving the intelligent levels of maritime surveillance and promoting maritime traffic automation.","Intelligent maritime surveillance,Maritime safety,Multi-scale collision risk,Graph clustering,Network theory,"
"context-aware dynamic asset allocation for maritime interdiction operations","2020","This paper validates two approximate dynamic programming approaches on a maritime interdiction problem involving the allocation of multiple heterogeneous assets over a large area of responsibility to interdict multiple drug smugglers using heterogeneous types of transportation on the sea with varying contraband weights.

We validate the proposed architectural and algorithmic concepts via several realistic mission scenarios. We conduct sensitivity analyses to quantify the robustness and proactivity of our approach, as well as to measure the value of information used in the allocation process.

"graph signal variation detection: a novel approach for identifying and reconstructing ship ais tangled trajectories","2023","Tangles are a common anomaly in Automatic Identification System (AIS) data, resulting from disorder in time sequences. They increase the spatial complexity of trajectories, making existing methods unable to fully recognize and process them. This will seriously affect the analysis of ship behavior. Furthermore, existing methods often directly remove after recognition, resulting in a significant loss of local information. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an algorithm called Graph Signal Variation Detection (GSVD) to recognize and reconstruct tangles. Initially, data preprocessing is conducted to remove redundant and stationary points. Then, construct the vertices and edges of the graph using indicators integrating AIS data features and ship trajectories, respectively. The tangled region is identified by calculating the total variation theory of the graph. The tangled region is reconstructed using the greedy heuristic, and the optimal reconstruction path is determined by combining total variation quantization. Finally, the GSVD is compared with four prevailing methods, through qualitative and quantitative analyses. The results demonstrate that the GSVD surpasses the other methods in terms of recognition accuracy, recall rates, and false alarm rates. Additionally, the GSVD can effectively reconstruct the tangle.","Total variation,Trajectory preprocessing,Graph signal,AIS data,Greedy algorithm,"
"a strategy for detecting derelict fishing gear at sea","2012","Derelict fishing gear (DFG) is a highly persistent form of marine pollution known to cause environmental and economic damage. At-sea detection of DFG would support pelagic removal of this gear to prevent and minimize impacts on marine environments and species. In 2008, experts in marine debris, oceanography, remote sensing, and marine policy outlined a strategy to develop the capability to detect and ultimately remove DFG from the open ocean. The strategy includes three interrelated components: understanding the characteristics of the targeted DFG, indirectly detecting DFG by modeling likely locations, and directly detecting pelagic DFG using remote sensing. Together, these components aim to refine the search area, increase the likelihood of detection, and decrease mitigation response time, thereby providing guidance for removal operations. Here, we present this at-sea detection strategy, relate it to relevant extant research and technology, and identify gaps that currently prevent successful at-sea detection and removal of DFG.","Remote sensing,Marine debris,Derelict fishing gear,"
"triton: high-speed maritime wireless mesh network","2013","This article presents the TRI-media Telematic Oceanographic Network (TRITON) project, which aims to develop a high-speed and low-cost maritime communication system. The article includes information pertaining to background studies, high-level architecture, network feasibility, maritime communication environment, technology developments, prototype implementations and link performance measurements. The motivation for this project stems from the fact that there is an increasing need for low-cost and high-speed maritime communication, with demands mainly coming from regulatory and crew welfare needs. The system described in this article is a wireless mesh network based on the IEEE 802.16. An analysis of the node connectivity based on real ship traffic data shows that the network is feasible in shipping lanes with a high density of ships. The system also considers the use of an intelligent middleware to allow communications to switch back to a satellite link in cases where neighboring ships are sparse or at locations far away from mesh base stations. Protocol enhancements to both the Medium Access Control (MAC) and networking layers and a hardware design that features multiple transceivers and the implementation of antenna switching to counter sea wave reflection and rocking problems are presented.

"marine parameters from synergy of optical and radar satellite data","2002","In 2001 the European Space Agency ESA will launch the earth observation satellite ENVISAT. It will carry several instruments that provide new opportunities to measure oceanographic variables. Together, they represent the main measurement techniques of satellite oceanography, and complement each other in an ideal manner. These instruments are to be used in synergy to: &#x02022;Improve the analysis of measured wind and ocean wave fields, and thereby improve weather forecasting at weather centers;&#x02022;Determine the extent and variables of sea ice and develop a five-day sea ice prediction model, to support maritime shipping and offshore activities;&#x02022;Monitor and map sediment and suspended matter transport in coastal regions, especially in areas with large river estuaries, which greatly affects shipping lanes, harbors, and dredging activities;&#x02022;Monitor hydrobiological and bio-geochemical variables related to water quality in coastal regions and large inland waters, which affects ecology, coastal development, aquaculture, drinking water supplies, and tourism. To prepare the oceanographic community to make best use of the ENVISAT sensors in the pre-launch phase, existing algorithms to derive marine parameters are used and validated using data from the ERS SAR, the ERS RA, SeaWiFS and IRS MOS sensors now in operation.

"temporal-spatio evolution of maritime accidents","2023","As an important passage connecting China with Southeast Asia, South Asia and the Middle East, the South China Sea has an important geopolitical and economic strategic position.

It is concluded that the hot spots of accidents in the South China Sea are mainly distributed in several important ports and coastal areas of the South China Sea, showing an obvious spatial clustering phenomenon. Meanwhile, combined with the time evolution of the past 40 years, this paper analyzes the spatio-temporal evolution of maritime accidents in the South China Sea, evaluates the risk of different maritime accidents and proposes corresponding prevention strategies, including strengthening supervision, conducting operation and technical training for sailors, using digital system to manage cargo and improving information sharing mechanism to promote cooperation among neighboring countries.

"adaptive detection tracking system for autonomous uav maritime patrolling","2020","Nowadays, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are considered reliable systems, suitable for several autonomous applications, especially for target detection and tracking. Although significant developments were achieved in object detection systems over the last decades using the deep learning technique known as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), there are still research gaps in this area. In this paper, we present a new object detection-tracking algorithm that can be used on low power consuming processing boards. In particular, we analysed a specific application scenario in which a UAV patrols coastlines and autonomously classifies different kind of marine objects. Current state of the art solutions propose centralised architectures or flying systems with human in the loop, making the whole system poorly efficient and not scalable. On the contrary, applying a Deep Learning detection system that runs on commercial Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) makes UAVs potentially more efficient than humans (especially for dull tasks like coastline patrolling) and the whole system becomes easily scalable because each UAV can fly independently and the Ground Control Station does not represent a bottleneck. To deal with this task, a database consisting of more than 115000 images was created to train and test several CNN architectures. Furthermore, an adaptive detection-tracking algorithm was introduced to make the whole system faster by optimizing the balancing between detecting new objects and tracking existing targets. The proposed solution is based on the measure of the tracking confidence and the frame similarity, by means of the Structural SIMilarity (SSIM) index, computed both globally and locally. Finally, the developed algorithms were tested on a realistic scenario by means of a UAV test-bed.","unmanned aerial vehicles,coastline patrolling,target detection,robot vision,adaptive detection tracking,Machine learning,Feature extraction,target tracking,service robots,object detection tracking,CNN,deep learning detection system,graphics processing units,Target tracking,object detection,pinhole camera model,image classification,autonomous UAV maritime patrolling,neural net architecture,convolutional neural nets,autonomous aerial vehicles,convolutional neural networks,Training,Convolutional neural networks,Unmanned aerial vehicles,CNN architectures,Detection-Tracking System,structural similarity index,autonomous classification,learning (artificial intelligence),Detectors,UAV,"

The resulting directed graph ultimately leads to the detection and statistical characterization of recurrent maritime traffic patterns.

"variability and propagation of labrador sea water in the southern subpolar north atlantic","2009","The variability of two modes of Labrador Sea Water (LSW) (upper and deep Labrador Sea Water) and their respective spreading in the interior North Atlantic Ocean are investigated by means of repeated ship surveys carried out along the zonal WOCE line A2/AR19 located at 43–48°N (1993–2007) and along the GOOS line at about 48–51°N (1997–2002). Hydrographic section data are complemented by temperature, salinity, and velocity time series recorded by two moorings. They have been deployed at the western flank of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR) in the Newfoundland Basin during 1996–2004. The analysis of hydrographic anomalies at various longitudes points to a gradual eastward propagation of LSW-related signals, which happens on time scales of 3–6 years from the formation region towards the MAR. Interactions of the North Atlantic Current (NAC) with the Deep Western Boundary Current (DWBC) close to Flemish Cap point to the NAC being the main distributor of the different types of LSW into the interior of the Newfoundland Basin. Comparisons between the ship data and the mooring records revealed that the mooring sites are located in a region affected by highly variable flow. The mooring time series demonstrate an elevated level of variability with eddy activity and variability associated with the NAC considerably influencing the LSW signals in this region. Hydrographic data taken from Argo profiles from the vicinity of the mooring sites turned out to mimic quite well the temporal evolution captured by the moorings. There is some indication of occasional southward flow in the LSW layer near the MAR. If this can be considered as a hint to an interior LSW-route, it is at least of minor importance in comparison to the DWBC. It acts as an important supplier for the interior North Atlantic, distributing older and recently formed LSW modes southward along the MAR.","Water mass spreading,Subpolar North Atlantic,Mid-Atlantic Ridge,Ocean circulation,Labrador Sea Water,"
"response strategies of the main forest types to climatic anomalies across croatian biogeographic regions inferred from fapar remote sensing data","2014","Croatia is positioned in the transitional zone of South-eastern Europe and the Mediterranean, a region with frequent occurrence of severe droughts and dry spells, which makes it particularly vulnerable to the impact of climate change. It distends across three main European biogeographical regions – Continental, Alpine and Mediterranean – and therefore has a very high level of forest diversity comprised of 11 out of 14 European forest types. This makes it very convenient to study the exposure of main European forest types to extreme climatic events in the southern limits of their species distribution range. This study provides an assessment of responses of forest vegetation under episodes of climatic anomalies consisting of the most severe historical dry and warm spells in 2000 and 2003, together with the extremely rainy season in 2005 across Croatian territory. The question of interest in this study was to reveal how the existing forest types across the territorial gradient respond to highly expressed extreme climatic variations and to infer some clues about related adaptive strategies. The regional scale approach was applied which previously performed structural delineation of forest cover into eleven main forest groups or bioclimates and were examined considering functional differences. Responses of eleven bioclimatic types were analyzed by time series (1998–2005) of monthly FAPAR (The Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetic Active Radiation) coverage with a spatial resolution of 1.2km, freely available from JRC FAPAR project. To quantify and differentiate the vegetation response in the considered years we adopted indices of resilience (resistance, recovery, resilience and relative resilience). We also provided a modified approach by applying these indices on a seasonal scale to examine the relationship between variations of phenology and ecosystem responses. The results confirmed the modification of seasonality of photosynthetic activity in relation to the altitudinal and spatial gradient. At the intra-seasonal scale, we distinguished specific opportunistic behavior of the common beech and oak forest types to alternating climatic conditions. Beech forest types show a very high ability to shift their phenology to earlier spring warming as a consequence of global warming. However, continental and Mediterranean oak forest types and in particular Aleppo pine and holm oak forests showed a higher increase of FAPAR during rainy events. The revealed capability of some tree species to better exploit rainfall in very wet periodic episodes has to be further evaluated in drawing conclusions about the overall resilience of forests under future climate change scenarios.","Extreme climatic events,Forest resilience,Climate change impacts,Land surface phenology,Forest responses,Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR),"

The research of the Hepu Han Tombs can offer opportunities to understand the burial customs and the Han culture in the Chinese Han Dynasty. With the aim of detecting the location, depth and geometry of two burial mounds at Jinjiling Site of Hepu Han Tombs, an electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) survey was performed in cooperation with archaeological team to calibrate the results with detailed information from the limited drillings in the area. Besides, series of 2-D ERT sections, acquired above the larger mound, were combined into a “Pseudo 3-D” volume, and iso-resistivity surfaces were further calculated to emphasize the location and lateral variations within the data volume, expected towards a more detailed and quantitative interpretation. Both the 2-D and 3-D resistivity imaging gave a clear evidence of structural details of the burial mounds. The results have shown a general consistency between the geophysical work and traditional archaeological drilling explorations, improving our knowledge on the un-excavated mounds, and allowing detailed pre-excavation plan at the Hepu Han Tombs.","Burial mounds,Hepu Han Tombs,Electrical resistivity tomography (ERT),Drillings,"
"building resilience through foresight: the case of maritime container shipping firms","2022","Maritime container shipping (MCS) firms represent the backbone of worldwide supply chains. Due to the emergence of global trends and disruptions, MCS firms increasingly face an uncertain environment. Consequently, MCS firms must develop dynamic capabilities to enable the reconfiguration of organizational resources for building resilience in a constantly changing business ecosystem. To create adequate dynamic capabilities, MCS firms need to anticipate the future of their macro environment through advanced foresight techniques. Using a Delphi-based scenario analysis, this study systematically examines scenarios for MCS firmsâ€™ macro environment. Twelve projections for the MCS industry were systematically created and were then assessed by 51 maritime experts. The resulting three distinct scenarios deliver valuable insights for MCS firmsâ€™ executives, whereas the blockchains and drones technology will have already increased efficiency in the short-term scenario â€œpicking the low-hanging fruit,â€ other technological disruptions will only affect the industry in the medium-term scenario â€œexperiencing an era of dichotomy.â€ In the long-term scenario â€œovercoming the obstacles of the generational shift,â€ MCS firms will experience a transfer toward alternative fuel powered and autonomously driven vessels. Offering detailed scenarios for the future MCS macro environment, this study represents a guide for decision-makers on how to create dynamic capabilities in MCS firms to build resilience. Moreover, the results revealed differences in the expertsâ€™ assessments due to their characteristics. Therefore, the study contributes to the academic focus on in-depth diversity analysis in the Delphi methodology and emphasizes the relevance of incorporating multiple stakeholders and panelists in future planning.","Pandemics,freight transportation,maritime,Uncertainty,scenarios,technology foresight,Delphi,Containers,COVID-19,judgmental forecasting,Bibliographies,Industries,Planning,Supply chains,"

As numerous small satellites were launched in recent years, millions of AIS messages are captured by these satellite AIS providers every day. The massive amount of data allow shipping firms and port operators to better predict vessels’ movement. In this study, a computational framework is developed to predict future trajectories and destinations of vessels by applying deep learning to the satellite AIS messages containing self-reporting positioning data. We employed deep learning approaches for large-scale maritime prediction and identifies the most suitable deep neural networks for this specific application. Three prediction models, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Dense Neural Networks (DNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) have been tested in the framework. A multi-task learning architecture is implemented based on test results. Through sharing parameters while training, this architecture enables long-term destination predictions by balancing short-term trajectory predictions. The framework is validated globally with the experiments covering five large-scale sea areas. The experimental results demonstrate that the LSTM model with an average accuracy percentage of 85.1% outperforms the CNN and DNN with accuracy percentages of 68.3% and 78.2% respectively. The LSTM model with multi-task architecture can achieve an accuracy of 87.0%.

Two multi-institutional, multi-instrument campaigns, one under ‘Space Weather: Science and Applications’ and the other emphasizing tides under ‘Atmospheric Coupling Processes’ were conducted during February–April 2006. The highlights of the campaigns include improved prediction of equatorial spread-F (ESF) based on a ‘new factor’ combining the strength and asymmetry of the equatorial ionization anomaly (EIA); simultaneous detection of quasi-2-day wave at both E and F region heights; tomographic image showing a Traveling Ionospheric Disturbance (TID) in association with a counter electrojet (CEJ) event—all highlighting the neutral and electrodynamical coupling of the equatorial ionosphere−thermosphere regions; an unusual lowering of mesospheric temperature during a moderate geomagnetic storm—highlighting a new space weather effect; diurnal tide showing a peak amplitude of 35m/s at 45km in zonal wind and a significantly lower amplitude (∼15m/s) in the meridional wind and also evidence of convective activity in the lower atmosphere influencing the tidal variability in the Mesosphere−Lower Thermosphere (MLT) region highlighting the vertical coupling of the atmospheric regions. The development of models for equatorial and low latitude ionosphere has been among the prime activities taken up under ‘Space Climate’. Two models have been developed towards this end: one based on Second Degree (SD) relationships of F region parameters to the mean sun spot number and the other a Multiple Regression Analysis (MRA) based model involving expressions relating F region parameters to that representing solar and geomagnetic activities. The two models, intended for long and short term predictions, have been found to represent the equatorial and low latitude ionosphere over Indian longitudes better than the commonly used International Reference Ionosphere (IRI).

Consequently, all the features which have a polarimetric behaviour different from the sea are detected and considered as targets. A complete validation with RADARSAT-2 full polarimetric data was performed in Portsmouth, UK.

"smart anomaly detection for slocum underwater gliders with a variational autoencoder with long short-term memory networks","2022","Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are used extensively for monitoring the world’s oceans, taking measurements of oceanographic characteristics along the water column. Presently, there is no holistic anomaly detection system in operation and AUVs require experienced pilots to monitor the progress of missions. This results in a large operational overhead and reduces the number of AUVs that can be deployed simultaneously. This article proposes an online anomaly detection system for underwater gliders based on a data-driven approach. A novel Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Variational Autoencoder (VAE) has been developed and trained using field data from four deployments with healthy glider behaviour and then tested against four deployments where faults are present. The system is able to detect wing loss with a high degree of accuracy on gliders unseen during the models training, highlighting the generality of the model to different platforms. Additionally, the VAE method outperforms model-based solution for the detection of biofouling, proving its generality to different types of anomalies. The proposed smart anomaly detection will contribute to increasing the capacity of AUVs and reducing the dependence on support vessels and experienced pilots.","Underwater glider,Variational autoencoder,Marine autonomous system,Anomaly detection,Long short-term memory network,"
"meteorological regimes modulating dust outbreaks in southwest asia: the role of pressure anomaly and inter-tropical convergence zone on the 1–3 july 2014 case","2015","The present work examines the characteristics (source regions, pathways, vertical profiles) as well as the meteorological conditions and the role of the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) during a dust event on 1–3 July 2014 over southwest (SW) Asia. NCEP/NCAR reanalysis, meteorological and satellite remote sensing (MODIS, Meteosat, CALIPSO) observations are utilized. The major dust storm (AOD550 up to 1.5–2.0) was generated in the southern Karakum desert in Turkmenistan as a result of intense north winds (Levar), due to enhanced pressure gradient between the Caspian Sea and Hindu Kush Mountains. The dust storm was vertically extended up to 5km over the arid terrain of SW Asia, as a consequence of the deep mixing layer and increased convection, while over northern Arabian Sea it was mixed with another dust plume coming from Arabia and marine aerosols due to strong monsoon winds within the boundary layer. The regional topography, variations in pressure, monsoon circulation and the position of the ITCZ play a decisive role on modulation of the wind field, dust-storm pathways and vertical distribution of dust. Enhanced knowledge of atmospheric circulation and processes responsible for dust export over SW Asia and Arabian Sea in linkage to the Levar wind and Indian summer monsoon is essential for improving dust forecasts and simulations over the region.","MSLP anomalies,SW Asia,ITCZ position,Dust storm,Karakum desert,Vertical dust distribution,"
"mesoscale modeling of smoke transport over the southeast asian maritime continent: interplay of sea breeze, trade wind, typhoon, and topography","2013","The online-coupled Weather Research and Forecasting model with Chemistry (WRFchem) is used to simulate the transport of smoke particles over the Southeast Asian Maritime Continent during September–October 2006. In this period, dry conditions associated with the moderate El Niño event caused the largest regional biomass burning outbreak since 1997. Smoke emission in WRFchem is specified according to the Fire Locating and Modeling of Burning Emissions (FLAMBE) database derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) fire products. The modeled smoke transport pathway is found to be consistent with the MODIS true color images and measured mass concentration of surface PM10 (particulate matter with diameter less than 10μm). The interplay of sea/land breezes, typhoons and storms over the subtropical western Pacific Ocean, trade winds, and topographic effects, can be clearly seen in the model simulation. The most severe smoke events in 1–5 October 2006 are found to be associated with the meteorological responses to the typhoon Xangsane (#18) over the western subtropical Pacific Ocean, which moved smoke from Sumatra eastward in the lower troposphere (below 700hPa), forming smoke layers mixed with and above the boundary layer clouds over Borneo. In contrast, the second largest week-long smoke transport event of 15–18 October 2006 was associated with the seasonal monsoonal transition period, during which smoke plumes were wide spread over the 5°S–5°N zone as a result of (a) the near surface divergence coupled with the 700hPa bifurcation of wind (flowing both to the west and to the east), and (b) the near-surface southeasterly and easterly winds along the equator transporting smoke from Borneo to Sumatra and Peninsular Malaysia. Analysis of data from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarisation (CALIOP) shows that smoke particles in October 2006 were primarily located within 3.5km above the surface. Smoke particles contributed roughly half of the total aerosol extinction retrieved by CALIOP. Results suggest that the smoke injection height in the model should be set lower than the 2–5km commonly used in transport simulations; smoke release at ~0.8km instead of 2km above surface gives a consistently better match to CALIOP observations. Numerical experiments further show that the Titiwangsa Mountains in Malaysia Peninsula and Tama Abu Mountains in Borneo have significant impacts on smoke transport and the surface air quality in the vicinity.","Sea breeze,Trade wind,Typhoon,Southeast Asian Maritime Continent,Smoke particles,"
"deployment strategies of mobile networks for internet-of-things in smart maritime ports","2022","It is estimated that 80% of world trade is transported via maritime logistic. The maritime trade networks can be seen as a graph with links and nodes. For an optimal network, the links representing the maritime routes must be short (with minimal cost) and secure. The nodes of the network represents the maritime ports, which are hub sending, receiving or switching the goods (in form of containers). The ports has passed from analog to digital ports to make use of IT tools to speed up the process, especially the administrative part. Nowadays, we talk about smart ports that uses data to further speed up the process administratively but also use a full automation to accelerate/optimize the processing of the goods/containers in terminals/quay. Terminal Operation System (TOS) is the main components in these operations. Therefore, the use of Internet-of-Thing (IoT) in TOS a decisive step towards smart ports. In this work, we propose to extend the notion of IoT in other smart domains to be considered in the smart port paradigm, such smart building, smart grid, smart environment monitoring, etc. Furthermore, we study the optimal strategies for the deployment of a performing networking infrastructure, which is the core element in the IoT layered model. Private network based on Long Term Evolution (LTE/4G) has been estimated to be an optimal solution for private enterprise networking in Industry 4.0.

"a prototype gui for unmanned air vehicle mission planning and execution","2014","This paper describes the development of a graphical user interface which provides unique mission control services to unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) operators. The software has two modes of operation, Planning Mode and Execution Mode. In Planning Mode an operator can readily simulate a desired flight plan to determine mission feasibility. Key features of this mode include integration of forecast weather data and interactive trajectory planning. Harsh North Atlantic weather can jeopardize a mission, so running a simulation with predicted wind conditions may greatly reduce the risk of a UAV loss. In Execution Mode the operator can deploy an autonomous vehicle, change the route “on the fly”, hold the aircraft over a point of interest, and return the UAV to home base whenever necessary. In both modes the predicted and actual weather conditions are the key to mission success. All weather data required for these functions is automatically downloaded via the internet. Operation of the software, including interactive trajectory planning, weather observation, mission planning and execution, is achieved through a user-friendly graphical user interface. Simulation results, flight trajectories, and weather data can be saved for further analysis. Comparing missions with and without weather information, it was determined that meteorological information can have a very significant impact on the mission success or failure. In a typical example mission discussed here, including forecast weather conditions increased the UAV's fuel consumption by 18% and mission time by 26%.","airborne surveillance,autonomous vehicles,maritime security,UAV mission planning,graphical user interface,UAV mission control,Unmanned aerial vehicle control,"
"observation needs for climate information, prediction and application: capabilities of existing and future observing systems","2010","The demand for long-term, sustained, reliable data and derived information on climate and its changes has never been greater than today. Long-term, well-calibrated, global observations of Essential Climate Variables (ECV) such as air temperature, precipitation, and sea-surface temperature are critical for defining the evolving state of the Earth's climate. Observing systems routinely collect much of the required data covering 49 ECVs, and significant progress has been made in coverage and technological capability over the two decades since the Second World Climate Conference. However, many key regions and climatic zones remain poorly observed, and gaps are widening in some cases. Supporting infrastructures for data stewardship and analysis are largely in place but require strengthening, while those for linking with socio-economic data and for providing user-oriented information services require more substantial development. The current capabilities are summarized, and further actions are identified to ensure that climate observation activities more fully meet the needs of science and society. The Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) was established in 1992 with the goal of providing comprehensive information on the total climate system, involving a multidisciplinary range of physical, chemical and biological observations of the atmosphere, oceans and land. GCOS is a “system of systems” that builds on the climate-relevant components of existing observing systems, and relies almost entirely upon national efforts to maintain and enhance those systems. Contributing systems include the World Meteorological Organization Global Observing System (GOS) for meteorology, its Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW) for atmospheric composition, the Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS), led by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC), and the Global Terrestrial Observing System (GTOS), led by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). GCOS itself is the climate observing system within the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) developed under the auspices of the Group on Earth Observations (GEO). The established in situ networks and space-based components must be sustained and operated with ongoing attention to data quality in accordance with the GCOS Climate Monitoring Principles; enhancements must be made for some types of observations; the exchange of observations and delivery of data and information to users must be ensured; reprocessing and reanalysis must be strengthened; and national and international coordination must be improved. The consequence of not meeting these requirements would be to seriously compromise the information on, and predictions of, climate variability and change. Detailed information on GCOS and the datasets that are produced as a result of GCOS observing activities can be found at the Global Observing Systems Information Center (GOSIC) at http://gosic.org.","GEOSS,climate observations,GEO,ECV,GAW,GTOS,GOOS,essential climate variables,GCOS,"
"improved visualization of large temporal series for the evaluation of good environmental status","2019","Passive acoustic monitoring of underwater sounds is an emerging discipline that can be used to guarantee that anthropogenic noise meets acceptable limits, to detect the presence of cetacean species, and to ensure sustainable exploitation of our oceans and seas. In this scenario, graphical representation techniques play a key role in helping to reveal seasonal structures of human made noises. Nevertheless, for very long temporal series, it might be challenging to find a graphic visualization technique that allows representing a time range that is long enough to capture these seasonal events, while at the same time preserving short isolated events. We propose a framework for the creation of such visualization techniques and analyze the different stages involved: data reduction, color encoding, and signal processing on graphs. All of this is applied to data from deployments in two marine protected areas in order to provide an acoustic panorama and identify seasonal events.","Submarine environment,Hough transform,Ambient noise characterization,Data reduction,Surveillance,Big data visualization,Acoustic images,"

"spatiotemporal variability in bio-optical characteristics of the southwestern tropical indian ocean during boreal summer: biophysical influences","2022","The bio-optical characteristics of the surface ocean play a pivotal role in radiative transfer and photosynthetic carbon fixation. To examine spatiotemporal variability of bio-optical properties in the tropical Indian Ocean, a 10-day time-series comparative study was made at one fixed and 3 variable stations in the southwestern tropical Indian Ocean (SWTIO), and 4-stations in the Equatorial Indian Ocean (EIO) during June 2014. A total of 24 hyperspectral radiometer profiles were collected along with physicochemical parameters and phytoplankton pigments analysis. A negative sea level anomaly (SLA), higher precipitation, a more stable mixed layer, and higher buoyancy frequency (N2) were observed in SWTIO compared to EIO. The deep chlorophyll maxima (DCM) in SWTIO were characterised by deep biomass maxima (DBM) whereas in the EIO it was due to deep photoacclimation maxima (DAM). The photosynthetically available radiation (PAR) profiles were obtained by integrating downwelling irradiance from 400 to 700 nm suggesting that the SWTIO had a greater abundance of optically active substances (OAS) than the EIO. Surface chlorophyll a (Chl-a) was found to have significant relationships with phytoplankton absorption coefficient (aph(443)). Chl-a-specific phytoplankton absorption coefficients (a*ph(443)), total absorption coefficient (at(443)), and particulate backscattering (bbp(555)) were also related to Chl-a implying that the phytoplankton was in growth/active phase. The time-series variability of the phytoplankton and changes in the photosynthetic pigments (PSP) to photoprotective pigments (PPP) ratio at SWTIO suggested phytoplankton community shift during 5th to 7th days. Microplankton percent-abundances showed distinct linear relationships with Chl-a and bbp(555) implying that carbon fixation per unit Chl-a was higher in microplankton than in nano and picoplankton at SWTIO. The in situ Chl-a, aph(443), adg(443), Kd(490) and C¯ pd were used to validate the various empirical algorithms available as well as the satellite-retrieved data. The MODIS and VIIRS data correlated moderately. This study would help towards improving regional optimized algorithms for OAS and provide a baseline understanding of the scale of variability of primary production and carbon flux from space. In addition, this would contribute valuable bio-optical data from an under-sampled geographical area.","Subsurface stratification,Light absorption,Tropical Indian Ocean,Particulate backscattering,Deep chlorophyll maxima,Phytoplankton pigments,"
"bio-inspired topology control mechanism for autonomous underwater vehicles used in maritime surveillance","2013","Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are increasingly used in maritime applications to acquire underwater information. With the guidance of intelligent topology control algorithms, AUVs adjust their positions efficiently such that they achieve desired underwater wireless sensor network (UWSN) configurations. A suitable application can be using AUVs in surveillance tasks, where they uniformly spread throughout a harbor entry or around a large civilian or military maritime vessel (e.g., an aircraft carrier) to detect any hostile or unexpected underwater intrusions. Since geographical characteristics are different for each port (shape, depth, etc.) and underwater currents constantly change, manually controlling underwater vehicles for these tasks is not feasible. In this paper, we present a particle swarm optimization (PSO) based topology control mechanism, called 3D-PSO, for AUVs operating in unknown 3D underwater spaces. 3D-PSO uses limited information collected from an AUV's neighborhood to make movement decisions over an unknown 3D space. Each AUV, using our 3D-PSO, is able to adjust its movement speed and direction to achieve a better location towards obtaining a uniform distribution. Simulation experiments demonstrate that, despite the significant variance of topographies of harbor entrances and the undersides of ships, 3D-PSO is an efficient tool to guide AUVs in creating a protection area for a harbor or a maritime vessel.","surveillance,topology control,bio-inspired topology control mechanism,harbor entrances,underwater information,civilian vessel,bio-inspired algorithms,particle swarm optimisation,3D-PSO,underwater wireless sensor networks,protection area,Network topology,wireless sensor networks,Topology,maritime surveillance,self-organizing networks,particle swarm optimization,autonomous underwater vehicles,Underwater vehicles,unknown 3D underwater spaces,harbor entry,surveillance tasks,military maritime vessel,Nickel,UWSN configurations,marine vehicles,intelligent topology control algorithms,underwater wireless sensor network configuration,AUVs,security,unexpected underwater intrusion detection,Mobile nodes,geographical characteristics,"
"natural and anthropogenic submarine morphologies revealed by high resolution acoustic data in the gulf of izmir, western turkey","2016","This study includes the interpretation of submarine morphological structures using the multibeam echo sounder bathymetry and CHIRP high resolution seismic in the Gulf of Izmir. The faults as the indicator of active tectonics, submarine channels, gas seeps, active and inactive pockmarks are the main natural morphological features in the gulf. Additionally, man-made (anthropogenic) structures like navigation channels, excavation debrises and ships wrecks are also observed. Geomorphological development of the gulf is controlled by the active faults in the Neotectonic period. Therefore, detection of active faults is very critical for the morphology of the gulf where many faults with different orientations have been interpreted on the seismic data. In the central-outer part of the gulf to the W NW, there are some normal faults trending in the N NW and S SE direction, and in the eastern and southern part of the gulf, E–W trending normal faults are evident in the seabed topography. The water depth increases from the eastern (inner) to the outer section of the gulf in the W NW direction. The N NE margin and the coastal area are very shallow (<25 m) because of the Quaternary deltaic sediment influx from the Gediz River. There are several biogenic, shallow gas accumulations in and around the delta of this river. In addition, many active and inactive pockmarks and gas seeps are also observed in the delta sediments and near the active faults as evidence of hydrocarbon generation and seepage.","Gulf of Izmir,Gediz Delta,Uzunada Fault Zone,Chirp,Multibeam echo sounder,"
"textual risk mining for maritime situational awareness","2014","In this paper, we propose an auxiliary Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) integrated system for maritime situational awareness (MSA) operations. We bring into account a new and influential asset - human intuition and perception - to the existing semi-automated decision support systems that mostly rely on numerical data collected by electronic sensors or cameras located either directly on the vessels or in the maritime command-and-control centers. For our project, we gathered weekly textual reports spanning twelve months from the United States Worldwide Threats to Shipping Reports repository that belongs to the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), We considered the maritime incident reports written by human operators as a valuable and accessible unstructured textual input source in which a span of text1 is called â€œriskâ€ if it expresses one of the following kinds of vessel incidents: fired, robbed, boarded, hijacked, attacked, chased, approached, kidnapped, boarding attempted, suspiciously approached or clashed with. Our approach benefits from probability distributions of some useful features annotated based on a list of lexicons that contain expressions denoting vessel types, risks types, risk associates, maritime geographical locations, dates and times. These distributions are captured and used to anchor the span of â€œrisksâ€ as they are described in the textual reports. After some preprocessing steps that include tokenization, named entity extraction and part-of-speech tagging, the textual risk mining system applies a variety of sequence classification algorithms, e.g., Conditional Random Fields, Conditional Markov Models and Hidden Markov Models in order to compare the risk classification performance. Empirical results show that our NLP/ML-based system can extract variable-length risk spans from the textual reports with about 90% correctness.","Markov processes,decision support systems,hidden Markov models,statistical distributions,tokenization,Risk management,attacked vessel incident,human intuition,Hidden Markov models,maritime geographical locations,conditional Markov models,maritime domain awareness,maritime command-and-control centers,Feature extraction,natural language processing,chased vessel incident,entity extraction,variable-length risk span extraction,maritime incident reports,maritime situational awareness,sequence classification algorithms,conditional random fields,robbed vessel incident,electronic sensors,United States worldwide threats to shipping reports repository,maritime situational awareness operation,fired vessel incident,marine safety,National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency,marine engineering,boarded vessel incident,feature annotation,machine learning,semiautomated decision support systems,cameras,part-of-speech tagging,risk management,NLP/ML-based system,Classification algorithms,probability distributions,risks types,risk classification performance,textual risk mining system,weekly textual reports,auxiliary ML,auxiliary machine learning,hijacked vessel incident,command and control systems,vessels,human perception,vessel types,MSA operation,kidnapped vessel incident,risk associates,risk detection,NGA,text analysis,boarding attempted vessel incident,approached vessel incident,Data mining,learning (artificial intelligence),sequence-based classifiers,"
"combining fm broadcast, accelerometers, ieee 892.15.4 wireless and gps to secure maritime containers worldwide","2010","There are approximately 50 million maritime style containers entering and leaving ports in North America every year and 500 millions worldwide [8]. The interiors of such containers are rarely inspected. With market globalization, a large amount of these containers enter North America on a daily basis. Such containers may include contraband or dangerous items that present an economic or security risk. Despite significant security improvements, only 3 to 5% of the maritime containers, that arrive in or transition through North America, go through physical inspection. Current container tracking technologies solely based on GPS consume high DC power, are costly, require line-of-sight with satellites and they are often too large to be covert. It is possible to overcome some of these limitations by combining GPS with a tracking system based on the FM broadcast signal. Digital FM broadcast is an alternative man-made signal that is ubiquitous, provides a geographically unique frequency spectrum and is about 100,000 as strong as a GPS satellite signal. The combination of GPS and FM, called 'Broadcast Assisted GPSâ„¢' allows the development of a low-cost, low-power and miniature FM-GPS receiver that can trace the path that a container has taken for less than 25$ per container. This paper presents the first results of highway trials (train and sea trials are to be conducted in 2010-2011) of such a low cost, covert, 'Broadcast Assisted GPS'based technology, called 'FM-RFID Tagâ„¢' that records the worldwide displacement of containers and displays the path undertaken by the container while in transit.

Vessel motion dynamics are defined by multiple Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes with different long-run mean parameters, which in our approach can be estimated with a change detection procedure based on Page's test, aimed to reveal the spatial points representative of velocity changes. A density-based clustering algorithm is then applied to aggregate the detected changes into groups of similar elements and reject outliers.

"colregs-compliant unmanned surface vehicles collision avoidance based on improved differential evolution algorithm","2024","Unmanned surface vessel (USV) has a wide range of applications in oceanographic research, resource development, environment detection, and security rescue due to its advantages of maneuverability, flexibility, fast response, and intelligence. The ability of USVs to autonomously and effectively avoid obstacles in highly dynamic and uncertain marine environments is a prerequisite for the successful completion of their tasks. Therefore, in this article, a USV collision avoidance based on International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea and the Collision Risk Model with the Improved Differential Evolution Algorithm (CRI-DE) has been considered. Based on the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGs) and common practices of seafarers, an improved ship collision risk model is proposed. Specifically, the model is innovatively combined with the differential evolution algorithm (DE) as a constraint condition to further realize path planning in complex situations. Moreover, chaotic multi-population parallel optimization, parameter adaptive adjustment strategy, and the construction of fitness function based on individual path points are added to the DE. In this way, the ability to escape from local optima and enrich population diversity can be guaranteed. Finally, experiments based on the proposed CRI-DE are conducted and the results indicate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method.","Collision risk model,Path planning,Multi-ship collision avoidance,Improved differential evolution algorithm,"
"reversals of the geomagnetic field, magnetostratigraphy, and relative magnitude of paleosecular variation in the phanerozoic","1976","The percentage of normal and reversed magnetization in land-based paleomagnetic studies of Phanerozoic rocks (0 to − 570 m.y.) have been compiled in order to determine the long-term variation in polarity bias of the geomagnetic field. Where possible the results are compared with the record from marine magnetic anomalies. Only rarely is there an even balance between normal and reversed polarity. During the past 350 m.y. two quiet intervals can be recognized when few reversals occurred, the Cretaceous (KN about − 81 to − 110 m.y.) and Permo-Carboniferous (PCR about − 227 to − 313 m.y.). Less firmly established are two other quiet intervals, one in the Jurassic (JN about − 145 to − 165 m.y.), and one in the Triassic (TRN about − 205 to − 220 m.y.). Between these quiet intervals there are disturbed intervals when reversals were comparatively frequent. From − 680 to − 350 m.y. the paleomagnetic record is inadequate to delineate a succession of quiet and disturbed intervals although one is probably present. Maximum entropy spectral analysis reveals three periodicities, a dominant one at about 300 m.y. and others, less well-defined, at 113 and 57 m.y. The variations in polarity bias are compared with the paleosecular variation, and it is shown that the magnitude of the paleosecular variation is greater in disturbed than in quiet intervals. This indicates that the magnitude of paleosecular variation and polarity bias are governed by variations in the balance between non-dipole and dipole components of the field, and that these variations probably had their origin in processes near the core—mantle interface. The correspondence between the dominant periods of 300 m.y. and plate tectonics is noted and a causal relationship suggested.",""
"non-satellite broadband maritime communications for e-navigation services","2021","The development of broadband network access technologies available to users on land has triggered a rapid expansion of a diverse range of services provided by terrestrial networks. However, due to limitations of digital communication technologies in the off-shore area, the maritime ICT systems evolution so far has not followed that trend. Despite the e-navigation initiative defining the set of Maritime Services, the progress in the maritime ICT systems evolution has been slow. Only a few systems, including the VHF Data Exchange System (VDES), or the TRI-Media Telematic Oceanographic Network (TRITON) have been proposed to extend the basic set of services offered by classical radio-communication solutions. However, all those systems have significant limitations. The purpose of this paper is to introduce the netBaltic system designed as a fully heterogeneous system for modern maritime communications. Its unique feature is the capability to transparently use different communication technologies to efficiently support maritime ICT services, as well as openness for the incorporation of future communication technologies. The paper presents an overview of VDES, TRITON and netBaltic systems and analysis showing their expected strengths and weaknesses. The systems are then compared in simulated environments, illustrating real-world usage scenarios based on real maritime traffic information and performance measurements obtained during off-shore measurement campaigns. Results indicate that netBaltic seems to be the most versatile one and is capable of offering access to all services defined by International Maritime Organization, due to its ability to use different communication technologies simultaneously and functionality offered by its Delay Tolerant Networking component.","international maritime organization,Safety,wireless mesh networks,broadband network access technologies,wireless communication,Organizations,Communication systems,Wireless communication,VHF data exchange system,maritime ICT services,future communication technologies,maritime ICT systems evolution,different communication technologies,satellite communication,data communication,performance measurements,terrestrial networks,Broadband communication,digital communication technologies,TRI media telematic oceanographic network,modern maritime communications,netBaltic system,maritime services,maritime traffic information,telecommunication traffic,fully heterogeneous system,marine technology,classical radio communication solution,nonsatellite broadband maritime communications,broadband networks,computer networks,marine communication,e-navigation Services,network topology,mobile communication,Navigation,Task analysis,Information and communication technology,"

"analyzing congestion interdependencies of ports and container ship routes in the maritime network infrastructure","2018","Events, such as prolonged congestion in ports or unavailable ship routes in the maritime network, often initiate cascading congestions that block transportation and/or disrupt services over wide areas. Existing traffic flow analysis methods lack the ability to understand the cascading effects of delays in ship routes or how to reduce overall delays in greater maritime areas. Dependency risk graphs have been proposed as a tool for analyzing such cascading events using dependency chains. This paper proposes a risk-based interdependency analysis method capable to detect large-scale traffic congestions between interconnected ports and ship routes in the maritime network and provide solutions to improve flow. Presented dependency risk chains of ports along with graph theory help us analyze ship routes and detect ports that are affected most when other major ports are congested in the maritime network, detect the causes of bottlenecks, and provide valuable info in relieving delays across container ship routes. We apply the proposed method on historical container ship routing data provided by the MarineTraffic company that maintains a comprehensive maritime database worldwide for more than six million users monthly. This application-oriented, interdisciplinary effort culminated in a prototype tool is able to analyze the historical data for container ships in the entire global maritime network and detect congestion dependencies. The tool can be used to identify key shipping routes or ports that: 1) are prone to delays; 2) greatly affect the overall maritime network due to position, connections and risk of congestion; and/or 3) get affected the most by delays in previous route legs.","maritime database worldwide,cascading effects,Transportation,telecommunication network routing,graph,congestion interdependency analysis,centrality,vehicle routing,interconnected ports,transportation,Marine vehicles,sector,Delays,Mathematical model,Maritime,infrastructure,cascading,delay,Containers,ships,dependency risk chains,container,risk-based interdependency analysis method,dependency,flow,congestion,MarineTraffic company,impact,global maritime network infrastructure,sea ports,historical container ship routing data,containers,traffic flow analysis methods,graph theory,large-scale traffic congestion detection,risk,marine communication,Tools,route,Analytical models,port,"
"a merchant ship thermo-salinograph network in the pacific ocean","1996","The need for better knowledge of sea surface salinity (SSS) and sea surface temperature (SST) distribution in the tropical oceans was brought to light during the 10 years of the TOGA programme (1985–1994). In order to improve on the original “meteorological bucket” method of sampling, we developed a network of merchant ships among those operating regular routes through the tropical Pacific, and equipped them with thermo-salinographs. Accurate positioning of the ships was obtained using a satellite positioning system. High frequency sampling (every 15 s) and recording of the median values for every 5 min resulted in quite precise monitoring of the SST and SSS, and in a description of the salinity fronts along the routes followed by the ships. Using this equipment, we were able to detect the influence of local rainfall on salinity and temperature and the diurnal cycle of sea surface temperature. The accuracy of salinity measurements (0.02) was better than that of the old sampling technique by one order of magnitude. Temperature measurement by the thermo-salinograph was very stable but yielded results that are 0.2–0.3°C higher than sea surface temperature. To ensure reliability of data, the equipment was carefully checked every time the ships called at Noumea (i.e. every 2–3 months), and re-calibration every year or two is essential.",""
"eprd: exploiting prior knowledge for evidence-providing automatic rumor detection","2023","With the prevalence of social media platforms, rumors have been a serious social problem. Notably, existing rumor detection methods simply provide detection labels while ignoring their explanation. However, illustrating the reasons why a suspicious statement is a rumor is essential. To address this realistic scenario, we propose a novel Evidence-Providing Rumor Detection model called EPRD. EPRD incorporates a wide variety of information from both prior knowledge sources and current comments. It also learns bilaterally friendly representations for interpretable rumor detection. EPRD first retrieves evidence from prior knowledge sources and checks the relationship between the given statement and its evidence. Our model then constructs two heterogeneous graph objects to simulate the propagation layout of the current comments and evidence relationships. Finally, EPRD integrates the GraphSAGE component and attention mechanism to detect rumors. To the best of our knowledge, we propose the first model that incorporates prior knowledge to verify rumors and boost credibility. Experiments on two real-world Twitter datasets demonstrate that EPRD consistently exhibits the best rumor detection performance. Moreover, EPRD outperforms other baselines in the early rumor detection task.","Deep learning,Graph neural network,Rumor detection,Evidence,Natural language inference,"
"application scenarios of nautical ad-hoc network for maritime communications","2009","In terrestrial wireless communications, high data-rate transmission can be readily achieved by installing base stations on the ground. However, the same system may not be adapted to maritime communication due to the geographically restricted nature of the sea, and therefore, MF/HF modems, capable of long-distance transmission, with low data-rate are frequently employed in maritime communication. Maritime satellite communication through Inmarsat is conventionally used to compensate for the low data-rate transmission of MF/HF modems, but its high cost still remains as a main drawback. In order to enhance the transmission speed with a fairly low price, in general, a network whose architecture is similar to Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (VANET), that allows peer-to-peer communications without base stations, i.e., ad-hoc network, is crucial. Herein, we propose an ad-hoc network for nautical environment, which is named as Nautical Ad-hoc Network (NANET). In this paper, scenarios toward NANET development are described and analysis of multiple access and duplexing schemes for corresponding NANET scenarios is discussed. A guideline for further research and developmental strategies on NANET is also suggested.","Wireless communication,NANET,Peer to peer computing,ad hoc networks,Underwater communication,Marine safety,IP networks,mobile communication,Ad hoc networks,Modems,Costs,Satellite communication,marine vehicles,Base stations,peer-to-peer communications,Marine vehicles,maritime communications,nautical ad-hoc network,"
"traffic pattern detection using the hough transformation for anomaly detection to improve maritime domain awareness","2014","Techniques for extracting traffic patterns from ship position data to generate atlases of expected ocean travel are developed in this paper. An archive of historical data is used to develop a traffic density grid. The Hough transformation is used to extract linear patterns of elevated density from the traffic density grid, which can be considered the â€œhighwaysâ€ of the oceans. These highways collectively create an atlas that is used to define geographical regions of expected ship locations. The atlas generation techniques are demonstrated using automated information system (AIS) ship position data to detect highways in both open-ocean and coastal areas. Additionally, the atlas generation techniques are used to explore variability in ship traffic as a result of extreme weather. The development of an automatic atlas generation technique that can be used to develop a definition of normal maritime behavior is a significant result of this research.","Traffic control,historical data archive,highway detection,Pattern Extraction,geographical regions,automatic atlas generation technique,cartography,anomaly detection,Marine vehicles,maritime domain awareness,traffic density grid,geography,AIS ship position data,Meteorology,Hough transformation,normal maritime behavior,ships,Maritime Domain Awareness,marine engineering,Hough Transformation,Hough transforms,Oceans,traffic information systems,traffic pattern extraction,coastal area,automated information system ship position data,linear pattern extraction,traffic pattern detection,Road transportation,Market research,ship traffic,image processing,Data mining,ocean travel,open-ocean area,Automated Information System,"
"adaptive detection of spatial point event outliers using multilevel constrained delaunay triangulation","2016","Spatial outlier detection is a research hot spot in the field of spatial data mining. Because of the lack of specific research on spatial point events, this study presents an adaptive approach for spatial point events outlier detection (SPEOD) using multilevel constrained Delaunay triangulation. First, the spatial proximity relationships between spatial point events are roughly captured by Delaunay triangulation. Then, three-level constraints are described and used to refine spatial proximity relationships with the consideration of statistical characteristics. Finally, those spatial point events connected by remaining edges are gathered to form a series of subgraphs. Those subgraphs containing very few point events are regarded as spatial outliers. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world spatial data sets are used to show that the proposed SPEOD algorithm can detect various types of spatial point event outliers with high efficiency. Moreover, there is no need to input any parameter in SPEOD.","Spatial point events,Multilevel constrained Delaunay triangulation,Spatial outliers,"
"maritime target detection based on radar graph data and graph convolutional network","2022","Due to the complex sea clutter environment and target features, the conventional statistical theory-based methods cannot achieve high performance in maritime target detection tasks. Conventional deep learning, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs)-based target detection methods process each signal sample independently, and the temporal-spatial domain correlation information is seldom used. To achieve full utilization of information contained in radar signals and improve the detection performance, a graph convolutional network (GCN) is considered, which has shown great advantages in graph data processing and has been applied in the field of signal processing. This letter proposed a maritime target detection method based on radar signal graph data and graph convolution. Graph structure data is applied to define the detection units and to represent the temporal and spatial information of detection units. The target detection of the signal corresponding to the nodes is conducted via GCN. Experimental results show that the proposed approach can effectively detect marine targets when the signal-to-noise ratio is above âˆ’5 dB and can effectively suppress false alarms in the pure clutter area, which is not adjacent to targets. Compared with the popular used CNN method, e.g., LeNet, the proposed method can achieve higher detection probability with the same given false alarm rate.","marine radar,deep learning (artificial intelligence),signal processing,radar detection,graph data processing,radar clutter,graph convolutional network,conventional statistical theory-based methods,radar signals,Feature extraction,sea clutter,signal sampling,Manganese,deep learning,radar target detection,temporal-spatial domain correlation information,object detection,radar signal graph data,convolutional neural networks-based target detection methods,Radar,graph theory,Convolution,radar signal processing,convolutional neural nets,graph structure data,Graph convolutional network (GCN),higher detection probability,graph data,temporal information,CNN method,marine targets,maritime target detection method,Clutter,Object detection,signal-to-noise ratio,radar graph data,maritime target,Radar detection,spatial information,"

"spatial relationship between phytophthora ramorum and roads or streams in oregon tanoak forests","2014","The pathogen, Phytophthora ramorum, causal agent of sudden oak death (SOD) of oaks and tanoaks, continues to expand its range within Oregon despite an effort to eradicate it from native forests. With its early detection and prompt removal of infected hosts, the Oregon SOD eradication program has produced a landscape distribution of disease resulting predominantly from the long distance (100m to 4km) dispersal of inoculum between sites. Using a regionally restricted randomization test reflecting the south to north intensification of the SOD epidemic in Oregon, we assessed if the movement of P. ramorum between sites was spatially dependant upon roads and streams, topographic features associated with the landscape-scale movement of soil and water borne inoculum of related Phytophthora spp. Dissimilar to other forest Phytophthora spp. we found no association between SOD sites and the road network. We did, however, determine that SOD sites are occurring closer to streams than would be expected by chance, especially in regions with microclimates less conducive to establishment. Environmental conditions and/or dispersal mechanisms associated with streams may contribute to the distribution of SOD in Oregon tanoak forests. Monitoring and management should therefore concentrate on susceptible forests in close proximity to streams, especially in stands further inland from a coastal climate.","Sudden oak death,Spatial spread,Invasive pathogen,Forest pathology,Restricted randomization,"
"eeg-based maritime object detection for iot-driven surveillance systems in smart ocean","2020","Automated maritime object detection is a significant research challenge in intelligent marine surveillance systems for the Internet of Things (IoT) and smart ocean applications. In particular, ship detection is recognized as one of the core research issues of these IoT-driven intelligent marine surveillance systems. Traditional methods based on machine learning have made some achievements in detection tasks for specific objects. However, the ship objects are relatively small, and they are usually not accurately detected. In this article, we propose an electroencephalography (EEG)-based maritime object detection algorithm for IoT-driven surveillance systems in the smart ocean. For this purpose, we conduct experiments to record the EEG signals of subjects when they are watching the maritime image scenes. With the feature analysis of EEG signals, the event-related potential (ERP) components associated with detecting objects are induced, such as the  $P3$  and  $N2$  components. Employing classification based on linear discriminant analysis (LDA), the area under curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) is used to evaluate the detection accuracy. We use this novel method to determine and identify essential objects and areas from IoT devices, such as digital camera imaging sensors. Our proposed method can not only help to detect small objects accurately using fewer samples but can also be used to reduce the data volume needed to be stored and transmitted in IoT-driven marine surveillance systems.","medical signal processing,surveillance,Electroencephalography,Electroencephalography (EEG),Internet of Things (IoT),ship detection,Internet of Things,Marine vehicles,maritime image scenes,Feature extraction,smart ocean applications,IoT-driven intelligent marine surveillance systems,maritime object detection,automated maritime object detection,ships,electroencephalography-based maritime object detection algorithm,Oceans,object detection,feature extraction,intelligent surveillance systems,IoT-driven marine surveillance systems,IoT devices,image sensors,smart ocean,Object detection,Surveillance,learning (artificial intelligence),electroencephalography,"

"a fast sar image position algorithm for maritime target location","2016","In order to find the maritime targets location in SAR image accurately, a fast R-D algorithm is introduced in this paper and it can solve targets location problems which are in the sea area. The real latitude and longitude coordinates measure system and geographical coordinates are built up for SAR image, then the targets located in the sea can be point out. First, based on information in SAR satellite data headers the Doppler center frequency coefficients can be calculated. Then the parameters are carried in the R-D pattern for calculate four vertex coordinates of SAR image. Generally the solution of R-D pattern is an iterative process, here a fast algorithm is proposed which combined with slope distance, Doppler parameters and earth model to reduce variables, then and the position of SAR is calculated and the latitude and longitude coordinates of target is also obtained. Second, the SAR image geocoding can be made up and the target in SAR image over sea can be found out. Finally, compare these results with AIS data, the accuracy of location is analyzed. The result shows that the deviation of distance location is less than 200 meters, and the deviation of azimuth is less than 6'. The error is reasonable for real application.

"the status of coastal oceanography in heavily impacted yellow and east china sea: past trends, progress, and possible futures","2015","Coastal environments are a key location for transport, commercial, residential and defence infrastructure, and have provided conditions suitable for economic growth. They also fulfil important cultural, recreational and aesthetic needs; have intrinsic ecosystem service values; and provide essential biogeochemical functions such as primary productivity, nutrient cycling and water filtration. The rapid expansion in economic development and anticipated growth of the population in the coastal zones along the Yellow and East China Sea basin has placed this region under intense multiple stresses. Here we aim to: 1) synthesize the new knowledge/science in coastal oceanography since 2010 within the context of the scientific literature published in English; 2) report on a citation analysis that assesses whether new research topics have emerged and integrated over time, indicate the location of modelling and field-based studies; and 3) suggest where the new research should develop for heavily impacted estuaries and coastal seas of East Asia. The conclusions of the synthesis include: 1) China has emerged as a dominant force in the region in producing scientific literature in coastal oceanography, although the area of publications has shifted from its traditional fields such as physical oceanography; 2) there has been an increasing number of publications with cross-disciplinary themes between physical oceanography and other fields of the biological, chemical, and geological disciplines, but vigorous and systematic funding mechanisms are still lacking to ensure the viability of large scale multi-disciplinary teams and projects in order to support trans-disciplinary research and newly emerging fields; 3) coastal oceanography is responding to new challenges, with many papers studying the impacts of human activities on marine environment and ecology, but so far very few studying management and conservation strategies or offering policy solutions.","Yellow Sea and East China Sea,Japan,conservation,Taiwan,Korea,physical and biogeochemical processes,management,coastal oceanography,China,"
"incorporating discrete unmanned maritime system data collections into ncei synthesized data products","2020","In recent years, Unmanned Maritime Systems (UMS) have become widely used in hydrographic surveys and oceanographic studies, especially in coastal regions. NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) has received an increased amount of data collected by UMS in the past 10 years. A variety of different types of data are typically collected simultaneously by UMS, which raises questions about the best practices for UMS data management. In this manuscript, we discuss enhancing the value of UMS data through integration into NCEI synthesized products. These products range from data-type specific databases like the Surface Underway Marine Database, and the World Ocean Database to analyses (value-added) products such as climatological mean fields and ocean time series of variables such as ocean heat and oxygen content. Data from Saildrones and Wave Glider missions demonstrate how data collected by Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USV) are integrated into the Surface Underway Marine Database. The integration of data from Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUV) systems - such as gliders - into the World Ocean Database is also described. Data management procedures and quality controls are discussed. The application of standardized methods adds long-term value to the original UMS, and improves the quality and reliability of the synthesized products.

"lagrangian analysis of multi-satellite data in support of open ocean marine protected area design","2017","Compared to ecosystem conservation in territorial seas, protecting the open ocean has peculiar geopolitical, economic and scientific challenges. One of the major obstacle is defining the boundary of an open ocean Marine Protected Area (MPA). In contrast to coastal ecosystems, which are mostly constrained by topographic structures fixed in time, the life of marine organisms in the open ocean is entrained by fluid dynamical structures like eddies and fronts, whose lifetime occurs on ecologically-relevant timescales. The position of these highly dynamical structures can vary interannually by hundreds of km, and so too will regions identified as ecologically relevant such as the foraging areas of marine predators. Thus, the expected foraging locations suggested from tracking data cannot be directly extrapolated beyond the year in which the data were collected. Here we explore the potential of Lagrangian methods applied to multisatellite data as a support tool for a MPA proposal by focusing on the Crozet archipelago oceanic area (Indian Sector of the Southern Ocean). By combining remote sensing with biologging information from a key marine top predator (Eudyptes chrysolophus, or Macaroni penguin) of the Southern Ocean foodweb, we identify a highly dynamic branch of the Subantarctic front as a foraging hotspot. By tracking this feature in historical satellite data (1993–2012) we are able to extrapolate the position of this foraging ground beyond the years in which tracking data are available and study its spatial variability.",""

"observing and understanding the southeast asian aerosol system by remote sensing: an initial review and analysis for the seven southeast asian studies (7seas) program","2013","Southeast Asia (SEA) hosts one of the most complex aerosol systems in the world, with convoluted meteorological scales, sharp geographic and socioeconomic features, high biological productivity, mixtures of a wide range of atmospheric pollutants, and likely a significant susceptibility to global climate change. This physical complexity of SEA is coupled with one of the world's most challenging environments for both in situ and remote sensing observation. The 7-Southeast Asian Studies (7SEAS) program was formed to facilitate interdisciplinary research into the integrated SEA aerosol environment via grass roots style collaboration. In support of the early 7SEAS program and the affiliated Southeast Asia Composition, Cloud, Climate Coupling Regional Study (SEAC4RS), this review was created to outline the network of connections linking aerosol particles in SEA with meteorology, climate and the total earth system. In this review, we focus on and repeatedly link back to our primary data source: satellite aerosol remote sensing and associated observability issues. We begin with a brief rationale for the program, outlining key aerosol impacts and, comparing their magnitudes to the relative uncertainty of observations. We then discuss aspects of SEA's physical, socio-economic and biological geography relevant to meteorology and observability issues associated with clouds and precipitation. We show that not only does SEA pose significant observability challenges for aerosol particles, but for clouds and precipitation as well. With the fundamentals of the environment outlined, we explore SEA's most studied aerosol issue: biomass burning. We summarize research on bulk aerosol properties for SEA, including a short synopsis of recent AERONET observations. We describe long range transport patterns. Finally, considerable attention is paid to satellite aerosol observability issues, with a face value comparison of common aerosol products in the region including passive and active aerosol products as well as fluxes. We show that satellite data products diverge greatly due to a host of known artifacts. These artifacts have important implications for how research is conducted, and care must be taken when using satellite products to study aerosol problems. The paper ends with a discussion of how the community can approach this complex and important environment.","Southeast Asia,Air Pollution,Biomass Burning,Aerosol,Meteorology,Remote Sensing,Maritime Continent,"
"multi-scale analysis reveals changing distribution patterns and the influence of social structure on the habitat use of an endangered marine predator, the sperm whale physeter macrocephalus in the western mediterranean sea","2020","The habitat use of marine megafauna emerges from the complex interplay between access to patchy and variable food resources and several intrinsic biological factors, such as the interaction with conspecifics and offspring care, resulting in dynamic distribution patterns. Quantifying species' relationships with the underlying environment is further complicated by the scale-dependent nature of these processes. Multi-scale analyses that incorporate aspects of a species' biology and build on large datasets are therefore required to understand long-term distribution and inform appropriate management measures. In this study, we use monitoring data collected over two study periods (2003–2008 and 2012–2018) to assess the habitat use, trend in local occurrence, and change in distribution of sperm whales, Physeter macrocephalus, around the Balearic Islands (Spain), one of the few recognised breeding and feeding grounds for the ‘Endangered’ population in the Mediterranean Sea. Moreover, we investigate the differences in the habitat use of single animals and groups, to explore intra-specific niche partitioning in this highly social but behaviourally dimorphic species. Results suggest that overall the occurrence of sperm whales in the area has been increasing over time. Animals were found to associate with distinct bathymetric features, but the mechanisms generating these relationships, and the underlying oceanographic processes within this habitat, remained uncertain. Sperm whale distribution also underwent a significant shift between the two study periods, with an increased occurrence in the Mallorca channel and north of Menorca, which further points towards a dynamic use of the broader bathymetric range preferred around the archipelago. Finally, our analyses highlighted that single animals and groups used areas with different characteristics, with groups preferring deeper, warmer waters characterised by lower sea level anomaly, which resulted in some fine-scale spatial segregation. The results of this study shed light on the mechanisms underpinning the biogeography and complex social system of the species, and support the design of targeted conservation measures in this important breeding and feeding ground.","Mediterranean sea,Distribution shift,Balearic archipelago,Sperm whale,Long-term monitoring,Habitat modeling,"

"estimation of the contributions of the sources driving pm2.5 levels in a central mediterranean coastal town","2018","Receptor modelling techniques are widely used in order to identify the main natural and anthropogenic processes driving aerosol levels at a receptor. In this work, Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) was used to apportion PM2.5 levels at a traffic site (Msida) located in a coastal town. 180 filters collected throughout a yearly sampling campaign conducted in 2016, were chemically characterized by light absorbance analysis, x-ray fluorescence and ion chromatography in order to determine the concentrations of black carbon, 17 elements and 5 ions, respectively. The resulting chemical data base was used in conjunction with PMF in order to identify the 7 components affecting the PM2.5 levels at the receptor site. Six of these sources are considered to be typical of the atmospheric composition of coastal traffic sites: traffic (27.3%), ammonium sulfate (23.6%), Saharan dust (15%), aged sea salt (12.7%), shipping (5%) and fresh sea salt (4.6%). This is the first time that such a study was carried out in Malta and helps in understanding the aerosol pollution climate of the Central Mediterranean, which is still relatively understudied when compared to the Eastern and Western Mediterranean.

"influence of climate variability on anchovy reproductive timing off northern chile","2016","We investigated the relationship between environmental variables and the Gonadosomatic Monthly Mean (GMM) index of anchovy (Engraulis ringens) to understand how the environment affects the dynamics of anchovy reproductive timing. The data examined corresponds to biological information collected from samples of the landings off northern Chile (18°21′S, 24°00′S) during the period 1990–2010. We used the Humboldt Current Index (HCI) and the Multivariate ENSO Index (MEI), which combine several physical-oceanographic factors in the Tropical and South Pacific regions. Using the GMM index, we studied the dynamics of anchovy reproductive timing at different intervals of length, specifically females with a length between 11.5 and 14cm (medium class) and longer than 14cm (large class). Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Mobile Average (SARIMA) was used to predict missing observations. The trends of the environment and reproductive indexes were explored via the Breaks For Additive Season and Trend (BFAST) statistical technique and the relationship between these indexes via cross-correlation functions (CCF) analysis. Our results showed that the habitat of anchovy switched from cool to warm condition, which also influenced gonad development. This was revealed by two and three significant changes (breaks) in the trend of the HCI and MEI indexes, and two significant breaks in the GMM of each time series of anchovy females (medium and large). Negative cross-correlation between the MEI index and GMM of medium and large class females was found, indicating that as the environment gets warmer (positive value of MEI) a decrease in the reproductive activity of anchovy can be expected. Correlation between the MEI index and larger females was stronger than with medium females. Additionally, our results indicate that the GMM index of anchovy for both length classes reaches two maximums per year; the first from August to September and the second from December to January. The intensity (maximum GMM values at rise point) of reproductive activity was not equal though, with the August–September peak being the highest. We also discuss how the synchronicity between environment and reproductive timing, the negative correlation found between MEI and GMM indexes, and the two increases per year of anchovy GMM relate to previous studies. Based on these findings we propose ways to advance in the understanding of how anchovy synchronize gonad development with the environment.","Length,Reproduction,Anchovy,Environment,Northern Chile,Humboldt Current System,"

The process is automatic, unsupervised, adaptive to the image content and independent from the order of analysis. A TerraSAR-X image and Cosmo-SkyMed images are used for the experiments.

"exploring ais data for intelligent maritime routes extraction","2020","Maritime traffic route is the basis for the analysis of ship traffic characteristics and navigation safety. However, the spatial freedom of ship navigation makes the extraction of maritime traffic route a challenging task. In order to realize the extraction of ship traffic routes at sea, a maritime route extraction method based on ship history automatic identification system (AIS) data is proposed. In this method, the ship trajectory with rich position information is transformed into a ship trip semantic object (STSO) with semantic information, and each ship trip is abstracted as a “stop-waypoint-stop” trip object. In addition, based on the graph theory, the STSO is further integrated into the nodes and edges of a directed maritime traffic graph to realize the extraction and expression of the shipping routes. In order to prove the effectiveness of this method, the real-world AIS historical data are used for testing, and the results show that this method can effectively extract maritime traffic routes.","Automatic Identification System (AIS),Semantic trajectory,Shipping route,Maritime traffic,Graph theory,"

"context-based models to overcome operational challenges in maritime security","2015","Piracy and smuggling are major international problems which not only threaten maritime security but also affect the global economy. Even though NATO and international forces have been relentlessly fighting maritime crime in East Africa (Gulf of Aden), the problems still persist and maritime crime has moved to West Africa (Gulf of Guinea). In the same vein, the Joint Interagency Task Force-South (JIATF-S) has had substantial operational success, controlling the vast geographical spread of smugglers in the East Pacific and Caribbean Sea. Due to limited number of maritime assets available, every resource needs to be efficiently allocated, both in time and space. This poses a great operational challenge requiring the integration and fusion of disparate information relevant to the mission and dynamic allocation of resources under uncertainty. Operational planning and execution for counter-smuggling and counter-piracy operations involve surveillance (to search, detect, track and identify potential threats) and interdiction operations (to intercept, investigate and potentially apprehend the suspects) in a dynamic and uncertain mission environment. In this paper, we present context-based models for counter-smuggling and counter-piracy missions, where the smuggling and piracy activities are represented in the form of color coded heat maps built using Intelligence information (INTEL), meteorological and oceanographic (METOC) information and other mission-specific attributes (sensor observations, target types and their behavior, etc.); these maps are interpreted as probability of activity (PoA) surfaces.

"mkcl: medical knowledge with contrastive learning model for radiology report generation","2023","Automatic radiology report generation has the potential to alert inexperienced radiologists to misdiagnoses or missed diagnoses and improve healthcare delivery efficiency by reducing the documentation workload of radiologists. Motivated by the continuous development of automatic image captioning, more and more deep learning methods have been proposed for automatic radiology report generation. However, the visual and textual data bias problem still face many challenges in the medical domain. Additionally, do not integrate medical knowledge, ignoring the mutual influences between medical findings, and abundant unlabeled medical images influence the accuracy of generating report. In this paper, we propose a Medical Knowledge with Contrastive Learning model (MKCL) to enhance radiology report generation. The proposed model MKCL uses IU Medical Knowledge Graph (IU-MKG) to mine the relationship among medical findings and improve the accuracy of identifying positive diseases findings from radiologic medical images. In particular, we design Knowledge Enhanced Attention (KEA), which integrates the IU-MKG and the extracted chest radiological visual features to alleviate textual data bias. Meanwhile, this paper leverages supervised contrastive learning to relieve radiographic medical images which have not been labeled, and identify abnormalities from images. Experimental results on the public dataset IU X-ray show that our proposed model MKCL outperforms other state-of-the-art report generation methods. Ablation studies also demonstrate that IU medical knowledge graph module and supervised contrastive learning module enhance the ability of the model to detect the abnormal parts and accurately describe the abnormal findings.

"a contextual hybrid model for vessel movement prediction","2021","Predicting the movement of the vessels can significantly improve the management of safety. While the movement can be a function of geographic contexts, the current systems and methods rarely incorporate contextual information into the analysis. This paper initially proposes a novel context-aware trajectoriesâ€™ simplification method to embed the effects of geographic context which guarantees the logical consistency of the compressed trajectories, and further suggests a hybrid method that is built upon a curvilinear model and deep neural networks. The proposed method employs contextual information to check the logical consistency of the curvilinear method and then, constructs a Context-aware Long Short-Term Memory (CLSTM) network that can take into account contextual variables, such as the vessel types. The proposed method can enhance the prediction accuracy while maintaining the logical consistency, through a recursive feedback loop. The implementations of the proposed approach on the Automatic Identification System (AIS) dataset, from the eastern coast of the United States of America which was collected, from November to December 2017, demonstrates the effectiveness and better compression, i.e. 80% compression ratio while maintaining the logical consistency. The estimated compressed trajectories are 23% more similar to their original trajectories compared to currently used simplification methods. Furthermore, the overall accuracy of the implemented hybrid method is 15.68% higher than the ordinary Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network which is currently used by various maritime systems and applications, including collision avoidance, vessel route planning, and anomaly detection systems.","recurrent neural nets,Safety,deep learning (artificial intelligence),Mathematical model,safety management,movement prediction,AIS dataset,Predictive models,curvilinear method,ubiquitous computing,deep neural networks,CLSTM network,ship behavior,deep learning,ships,automatic identification system dataset,marine safety,marine engineering,Data models,contextual hybrid model,contextual information,vessel movement prediction,United States of America,geographic context,data compression,Automatic identification system,vessel types,Trajectory,compressed trajectory estimation,context-aware LSTM network,vessel route planning,Deep learning,Context modeling,context-aware long short-term memory network,logical consistency,context-aware trajectories simplification,"
"assessment of tree and crown heights of a maritime pine forest at plot level using a fullwaveform ultraviolet lidar prototype","2010","This study aims to determine the potential of a new lidar prototype with an ultraviolet laser and a medium footprint for retrieving forest parameters. The lidar is embedded on an ultra-light aircraft. The choice of the Landes forest in southwestern France as study area was made regarding the flat topography of the area and the stand height consistency. We chose three plots from different stands (different height characteristics) and compared the lidar derived metries to field measurements. To derive metries from lidar data, we summed the lidar waveforms within a plot and calculated derived reflectance profiles to correct the lidar signal from the occlusion effect. We then retrieve plot mean total and mean crown base heights measurement from reflectance profiles. We obtain a good consistency of the lidar measurements compared to field measurements, even if we noticed the existence of a 5 to 10% bias probably linked to the lidar sampling strategy.","crown height,vegetation mapping,maritime pine forest,sampling methods,topography (Earth),signal analysis,Landes forest,ultralight aircraft,tree height,lidar,optical radar,lidar data,Decision support systems,height measurement,southwestern France,forestry,remote sensing by radar,topography,aerosols,fullwaveform ultraviolet lidar prototype,"
"grid size optimization for potential field based maritime anomaly detection","2014","This study focuses on improving the potential field based maritime data modeling method, developed to extract traffic patterns and detect anomalies, in a clear, understandable and informative way. The method's novelty lies in employing the concept of a potential field for AIS vessel tracking data abstraction and maritime traffic representation. Unlike the traditional maritime surveillance equipment, such as radar or GPS, the AIS system comprehensively represents the identity and properties of a vessel, as well as its behavior, thus preserving the effects of navigational decisions, based on the skills of experienced seamen. In the developed data modeling process, every vessel generates potential charges, which value represent the vessel's behavior, and drops the charges at locations it passes. Each AIS report is used to assign a potential charge at the reported vessel positions. The method derives three construction elements, which define, firstly, how charges are accumulated, secondly, how a charge decays over time, and thirdly, in what way the potential is distributed around the source charge. The collection of potential fields represents a model of normal behavior, and vessels not conforming to it are marked as anomalous. In the anomaly detection prototype system STRAND, the sensitivity of anomaly detection can be modified by setting a geographical coordinate grid precision to more dense or coarse. The objective of this study is to identify the optimal grid size for two different conditions – an open sea and a port area case. A noticeable shift can be observed between the results for the open sea and the port area. The plotted detection rates converge towards an optimal ratio for smaller grid sizes in the port area (60-200 meters), than in the open sea case (300-1000 meters). The effective outcome of the potential filed based anomaly detection is filtering out all vessels behaving normally and presenting a set of anomalies, for a subsequent incident analysis using STRAND as an information visualization tool.","maritime traffic,potential field,anomaly detection,AIS,"

Based on the AIS trajectory data of 2014, this paper constructs the oil transportation network of the MSR and analyzes the topological structure and spatial pattern of the oil transportation network of the MSR by applying the complex network theory. The study finds: The oil transportation network of the MSR exhibits the characteristics of the small-world and scale-free as a whole; The space difference of degree and degree distribution is large, and the network centrality shows a trend of decreasing scale and stratification; In the oil transport network, the ports who have the three largest centralities are all the Jurong Port, which has the highest overall centrality and is in the absolute core position; The top 10 ports of the three centralities are basically similar, with only a slight difference in the position order.

"intelligent anomaly detection of trajectories for iot empowered maritime transportation systems","2023","The convergence of Maritime Transportation Systems (MTS) and Internet of Things (IoT) has led to the promising IoT-empowered MTS (IoT-MTS). However, abnormal trajectories of maritime transportation ships can have highly negative impacts on the management of IoT-MTS. Therefore, anomaly detection of trajectories is important for the successful deployment of IoT-MTS. In this paper, we propose a Transfer Learning based Trajectory Anomaly Detection strategy, named TLTAD, for IoT-MTS. Specifically, a variational autoencoder is used to discover the potential connections between each dimension of the normal trajectory, while a graph variational autoencoder is used to explore the spatial similarity between normal trajectories. Based on internal connection of trajectories, a deep reinforcement learning algorithm, Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic policy gradient (TD3), is employed to train the trajectory anomaly detection model. To reduce the model training time, transfer learning is used to migrate the trained anomaly detection model between different regions of an ocean area or between similar ocean areas. Moreover, an efficient data transformation module is designed to improve the efficiency of model transfer. The experiments were conducted on a real-world automatic identification system (AIS) dataset. The results indicate that the proposed TLTAD can provide accurate anomaly detection on shipsâ€™ trajectories in IoT-MTS with reduced model training times.","reduced model training times,Transportation,deep learning (artificial intelligence),Anomaly detection,maritime transportation systems,anomaly detection,Internet of Things,transportation,Marine vehicles,abnormal trajectories,Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic policy gradient,highly negative impacts,model training time,ships,IoT-MTS,trajectory anomaly detection model,deep reinforcement learning algorithm,Data models,normal trajectory,reinforcement learning,maritime transportation ships,Artificial intelligence,real-world automatic identification system dataset,Maritime Transportation Systems,graph variational autoencoder,trained anomaly detection model,Trajectory Anomaly Detection strategy,gradient methods,Deep reinforcement learning,model transfer,Trajectory,promising IoT-empowered MTS,intelligent Anomaly Detection,transfer learning,learning (artificial intelligence),data handling,Analytical models,"
"potential impact of long-life environmental sonobuoys on littoral asw","2009","The focus of military activity has recently shifted from large area engagements to regional conflicts. Consequently, supportive Naval maritime operations have continued to evolve toward littoral warfare in complicated shallow-water, near-shore environments. This evolution requires new sensors, advanced Concept of Operations, and improved data-analysis capabilities, among others. Planning operations in these harsh-environment areas is difficult because accurate predictions of tactical sensor performance depend on detailed knowledge of the local environmental conditions. Tactical mission planning is thus seldom optimal or efficient, often resulting in coverage gaps, increased risk, and reduced mission success. According to a Navy Mission Need Statement, 'Air ASW tactical execution, especially in littoral seas, requires in-situ environmental updates for preflight mission planning. In the conduct of ASW operations, an urgent need for explicit knowledge of environmental variables is required to optimize the effectiveness of operational acoustic sensors, as well as acoustic sensors in development ' The Naval Air Systems Command has considered extended-life environmental sonobuoy concepts to better characterize the littoral environment. Most designs contain a thermistor string to measure ocean temperatures and also hydrophones to measure ambient noise. This type of complex sonobuoy would be more expensive than a traditional single-measurement AXBT but it could provide a more thorough littoral environment assessment. This paper examines the trade-off between increased sensor complexity and improved ASW performance, in terms of cumulative detection probability. Some advantages of an extended-life combined thermistor string/hydrophone approach, compared to AXBTs and tactical hydrophones, are: 1) higher accuracy of the raw data; 2) temporal averaging to smooth out fluctuations; 3) extended area coverage during drift; 4) less chance for surface temperature anomalies (e.g., mixed-layer-depth errors) caused by various electronic and mechanical variability upon impact; 5) opportunities to discover thermal and acoustic feature boundaries during drift; and 6) less need to re-seed thus allowing longer tactical mission times. These advantages are evaluated relative to the following disadvantages: 1) increased cost; 2) potential drift outside the mission area; and 3) need for increased battery life for longer durations. The analysis is tempered by considering how a potential new system might be used. One assumption is that an environmental sampling decision aid is available to determine the minimum number and best initial locations of drifting sensors to meet performance objectives. The November 2007 Requirements Document from the Naval Oceanographic Office states ?Sampling guidance: Development of guidance on the best way to deploy, spatially and temporally, observation systems in order to meet various forecasting, model assimilation, and model evaluation objectives is needed.? Work in this area is reported in this Oceans '09 Conference in a paper entitled ?Uncertainty-based Adaptive AXBT Sampling with SPOTS?, which addresses optimal sampling requirements. For this trade-off analysis, temperature data from watersampling flights in the Sea of Japan off the east coast of Korea were used to simulate expected capability of a long-term drifting thermistor string. Then optimal initial positions for three notional buoys were determined followed by a simulation of drifting positions and data collected over 12 days. Ocean nowcasts were constructed and used to determine acoustic performance of a notional tactical sonobuoy field. The analysis shows that a drifting extended-life thermistor string can provide significant improvement in environmental characterization, tactical planning, and ASW detection performance.","Acoustic measurements,Sea measurements,military systems,Predictive models,Sonar equipment,Sampling methods,Ocean temperature,Noise measurement,littoral ASW,operational acoustic sensors,Thermistors,Temperature measurement,Acoustic sensors,long-life environmental sonobuoys,"
"societal need for improved understanding of climate change, anthropogenic impacts, and geo-hazard warning drive development of ocean observatories in european seas","2011","Society’s needs for a network of in situ ocean observing systems cross many areas of earth and marine science. Here we review the science themes that benefit from data supplied from ocean observatories. Understanding from existing studies is fragmented to the extent that it lacks the coherent long-term monitoring needed to address questions at the scales essential to understand climate change and improve geo-hazard early warning. Data sets from the deep sea are particularly rare with long-term data available from only a few locations worldwide. These science areas have impacts on societal health and well-being and our awareness of ocean function in a shifting climate. Substantial efforts are underway to realise a network of open-ocean observatories around European Seas that will operate over multiple decades. Some systems are already collecting high-resolution data from surface, water column, seafloor, and sub-seafloor sensors linked to shore by satellite or cable connection in real or near-real time, along with samples and other data collected in a delayed mode. We expect that such observatories will contribute to answering major ocean science questions including: How can monitoring of factors such as seismic activity, pore fluid chemistry and pressure, and gas hydrate stability improve seismic, slope failure, and tsunami warning? What aspects of physical oceanography, biogeochemical cycling, and ecosystems will be most sensitive to climatic and anthropogenic change? What are natural versus anthropogenic changes? Most fundamentally, how are marine processes that occur at differing scales related? The development of ocean observatories provides a substantial opportunity for ocean science to evolve in Europe. Here we also describe some basic attributes of network design. Observatory networks provide the means to coordinate and integrate the collection of standardised data capable of bridging measurement scales across a dispersed area in European Seas adding needed certainty to estimates of future oceanic conditions. Observatory data can be analysed along with other data such as those from satellites, drifting floats, autonomous underwater vehicles, model analysis, and the known distribution and abundances of marine fauna in order to address some of the questions posed above. Standardised methods for information management are also becoming established to ensure better accessibility and traceability of these data sets and ultimately to increase their use for societal benefit. The connection of ocean observatory effort into larger frameworks including the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) and the Global Monitoring of Environment and Security (GMES) is integral to its success. It is in a greater integrated framework that the full potential of the component systems will be realised.",""

"comparison of new technologies for data exchange in the maritime hf frequency band","2013","Recently, the use of HF radiotelex on ships, as the only terrestrial communication system for data exchange has been kept to a minimum, and the need for alternative systems, which would use the existing HF communication channels to exchange data between ships and end users on land, arose. Satellite communication systems represent the main aid for the exchange of large amounts of data with high transmission rates, but at high costs of equipment and services. Hence, there is the need to explore new, simpler and cheaper technologies for data exchange, which could be an alternative or a substitute for the existing radiotelex system. In this paper, a detailed analysis of the two systems, which could easily replace the existing maritime NBDP (Narrow-Band Direct Printing) telegraphy, has been done. One of the systems is based on the OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplex) protocol, while the other, on the PACTOR-III protocol.

"ship trajectory prediction based on machine learning and deep learning: a systematic review and methods analysis","2023","Ship trajectory prediction based on Automatic Identification System (AIS) data has attracted increasing interest as it helps prevent collision accidents and eliminate potential navigational conflicts. Therefore, it is necessary and urgent to conduct a systematic analysis of all the prediction methods to help reveal their advantages to ensure safety at sea in different scenarios. It is particularly important and significant within the context of unmanned ships forming a new hybrid maritime traffic together with manned ships in the future. This paper aims to conduct a comparative analysis of the up-to-date ship trajectory prediction algorithms based on machine learning and deep learning methods. To do so, five classical machine learning methods (i.e., Kalman Filter, Gaussian Process Regression, Support Vector Regression, Random Forest, and Back Propagation Network) and eight deep learning methods (i.e., Recurrent Neural Networks, Long Short-Term Memory, Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory, Gate Recurrent Unit, Bi-directional Gate Recurrent Unit, Sequence to Sequence, Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network, and Transformer) are thoroughly analysed and compared from the algorithm essence and applications to excavate their features and adaptability for manned and unmanned ships. The findings reveal the characteristics of various prediction methods and provide valuable implications for different stakeholders to guide the best-fit choice of a particular method as the solution under a specific circumstance. It also makes contributions to the extraction of the research difficulties of ship trajectory prediction and the corresponding solutions that are put forward to guide the development of future research.","Deep learning,Maritime safety,Hybrid maritime traffic,Trajectory prediction,AIS data,Machine learning,"
"minimum winter temperature reconstruction from average earlywood vessel area of european oak (quercus robur) in n-poland","2016","Tree-ring-based temperature reconstructions form a substantial part of the international proxy data base used to examine and model global climate variations of the last Millennium. However, most tree-ring-based reconstructions are derived from study sites in the high latitudes or high altitudes, paying very little attention to low elevation sites. Thus, a large gap in the geographical coverage of climate reconstructions from temperate low elevation sites in central Europe still exists. This motivated us to concentrate our efforts on the European oak (Quercus robur) in N-Poland. We developed a new robust tree-ring width chronology (TRW), as well as four wood anatomical chronologies (e.g. average vessel area and number of vessels) from Q. robur for the period 1810 to 2010. The chronologies were examined for their climatological responses. While TRW was found to have weak correlations with climate, the earlywood vessel parameters (EVP), especially average vessel area (AVA), revealed significant positive correlations to minimum winter temperatures. Based on stable climate–growth correlations, a reconstruction of minimum winter temperatures (29th November to 20th January) back to 1810 was performed for north Poland. The reconstruction indicates a promising potential to reveal low-frequency climate information. An additional extreme year analysis suggested that in cold winters, a cold–warm–cold pattern in the minimum temperatures was responsible for the relatively small earlywood vessels. Spatial field correlations imply that our reconstruction is more related to temperature variations towards the east of Europe. The reconstructed temperature compared well with two existing temperature reconstructions, especially during most of the 20th century, even though the temperature reconstructions differ spatially and temporally. Based on these findings, the relatively extensive resource of archeological oak material from this region may be useful to perform multicentennial climate reconstructions in the temperate climate zone.","Temperature reconstruction,Poland,Temperate lowlands,Wood anatomy,Dendroclimatology,Earlywood vessel parameter,"

"mitigating threats of small vessels to maritime security","2012","This paper discusses technology solutions that may be used to mitigate potential threats and security risks arising from small vessels operating in a busy urban maritime domain such as the New York / New Jersey maritime domain. The solutions focus on persistent surveillance by detecting, tracking, and classifying small vessels, and address the risk posed by these vessels. In a series of experiments conducted in the Hudson River, we collected and analyzed data from various sensors and evaluated several potential technology solutions for detecting these security threats. The threats are addressed across multiple scenarios, ranging from man-made threats to coastal hazards, using assets including radars; acoustic and infrared sensors; vessels and vehicles; and oceanographic and meteorologic prediction tools focused on the water surface, underwater, and urban environments. The results of our experiments show that the combination of sensors provides a valuable means to identify small vessels that may pose a threat in a busy harbor.","Satellites,security threats,New York/New Jersey maritime domain,urban security,radar detection,acoustic sensors,maritime security,infrared sensors,underwater,radars,small vessel detection,security risks,Hudson river,Rivers,marine safety,small vessel tracking,man-made threats,small vessel threats,persistent surveillance,busy urban maritime domain,small vessel classification,Radar tracking,port security,coastal hazards,Acoustics,oceanographic prediction tools,water surface,urban environments,radar tracking,multiple scenarios,infrared detectors,Sensors,threat mitigation,acoustic transducers,Security,meteorologic prediction tools,"
"trial results of a new low-cost and covert technology to trace the path of maritime containers worldwide","2008","There are approximately 7 million maritime style containers within Canada, and 70 million within the USA. The interiors of such containers are rarely inspected. With market globalization, a large amount of these containers enter North America on a daily basis. Such containers may include contraband or dangerous items that present an economic or security risk. Despite significant security improvements, only 3 to 5% of the maritime containers, that arrive in or transition through North America, go through physical inspection. Current container tracking technologies based on GPS consume high DC power, are costly, require line-of-sight with satellites and they are often too large to be covert. It is possible to overcome some of these limitations by basing the tracking system on the FM broadcast signal which is an alternative man-made signal that is reasonably ubiquitous, provides a geographically unique frequency spectrum and is about 100,000 as strong as a GPS satellite signal. This allows the development of a low cost, low power and miniature FM receiver that can record frequency spectrums and compare them to known data in order to trace the path that the container has taken for less than 10$ per container. This paper presents the first results of highway trials (train and sea trials are to be conducted in 2009) of such a low cost, covert, non-GPS based technology (called 'FM Tag') that records the worldwide displacement of containers and displays the path undertaken by the container while in transit. As an added security benefit, the tag is also capable of detecting container door openings. In addition to presenting the first trial results, this paper covers the innovative engineering aspects of using the metal enclosure of a maritime container as a VHF antenna, thereby eliminating the need to add an external antenna and achieving the goal of being 100% covert.","Maritime container traceability,Costs,Inspection,low-cost covert technology,Global Positioning System,FM broadcast signal,ships,Containers,alternative man-made signal,high DC power,Maritime container intrusion sensor and Article traceability,Globalization,market globalization,maritime containers path,GPS,Satellite broadcasting,North America,Frequency,Power generation economics,Security,"
"a hierarchical graph-based model for mobility data representation and analysis","2022","Hierarchical representations of transportation networks should provide a better understanding of mobility patterns and the underlying structures at various abstraction levels. This paper introduces a hierarchical graph-based model for representing moving objects and trajectories according to multiple spatial, temporal and semantic scales. This formal model is implemented in a graph database and experimented with historical maritime data. Several experimental analyses explore and extract knowledge patterns from the hierarchical graph database. A series of queries applied to an European maritime network derive mobility patterns and highlight network structures.","Graph-based model,Maritime mobility,Network analysis,Hierarchical representation,Knowledge extraction,"
"detection and mapping of shipwrecks embedded in sea-floor sediments","2015","The paper discusses the detection of shipwrecks embedded in sea-floor sediments using a Chirp sub-bottom profiler. From a methodological-historical perspective it presents four examples of recent chirp recordings of verified shipwrecks embedded in different types of sediment environments, from different geographical and geological areas and from different periods. The effects of shallow water depths, different sediment types, recording speed and different (2D and 3D) sub-bottom profiler systems are briefly discussed. It is concluded that Chirps are well suited for survey purposes, producing high quality 2D profiles of good resolution and satisfactory penetration depth. Furthermore, the equipment is easy to handle from a small boat and allows flexible sailing. This type of 2D data is cheaper and faster to acquire and is easier to interpret and apparently also provides better resolution and detail than present 3D systems. Chirp data are therefore of great value in identifying and outlining shipwrecks hidden in the sea floor in survey situations where larger areas must be covered. The overall conclusion is that there are grounds for optimism with regard to this method of detection of maritime archaeological targets.","Subbottom seismics,Shallow water,Hard sediments,Akko,Mapping,Shipwreck,Detection,Maritime archaeology,"
"data-driven assessment of the survivability and maintainability of offshore renewable energy devices in irelandâ€™s harsh maritime climate","2023","Unobstructed across the vast expanse of the North Atlantic Ocean, the Irish maritime area encompasses some of the worldâ€™s most energy-intensive waves. However, high winds and associated large waves present a substantial engineering challenge to ensure the survivability of offshore renewable energy devices during extreme weather events. Finding adequate weather windows for installation, operation, and maintenance activities is another obstacle when deploying these devices. This paper presents the results of a large-scale analysis of wave and wind data around the coasts of Ireland and Wales. Extreme Value Analysis calculates the expected wave heights and wind speeds for extreme events (1-year, 10-year, 50-year and 100-year return periods). Weather windows are also calculated based on a matrix of wave heights, wind speeds and minimum durations required. A custom-developed GIS (Geographic Information System) tool visualises the results.","Weather window,survivability,Ireland's harsh maritime climate,vast expanse,data-driven assessment,extreme weather events,maintenance engineering,50-year,wind speeds,Extreme Value Analysis,energy-intensive waves,adequate weather windows,North Atlantic Ocean,ocean waves,offshore renewable energy,Wind speed,Renewable energy sources,Oceans,renewable energy sources,associated large waves,GIS mapping,high winds,Copernicus,Faces,offshore installations,geographic information systems,open source data,climatology,oceanographic regions,Robustness,wind speed,offshore renewable energy devices,wind,substantial engineering challenge,Irish maritime area,wave height,100-year return periods,expected wave heights,Predictive maintenance,Geographic information systems,"
"interannual variability of the physical characteristics of north thermaikos gulf (nw aegean sea)","2012","Thermaikos Gulf is a marine ecosystem of major importance, not only environmental, but also due to the various socioeconomic activities associated with the area. The physical characteristics of the gulf's waters were studied, analyzing in situ measurements of oceanographic parameters, collected during 5 oceanographic surveys from 1994 to 2007, on the same grid of 26 sampling stations. Aim of this paper is the detection and description of the main changes (seasonal and interannual) in the water masses' characteristics that are related to the seawater quality of the North Thermaikos. The connection between the main forcing factors and the major circulation patterns is also under investigation. The interannual analysis of the collected data revealed the existence of strong seasonal fluctuations that present significant deviations from a mean seasonal pattern in specific periods. A general decreasing trend of the salinities of the domain is observed during the study period. At the same time, a strong relation between open Aegean Sea waters and riverine freshwater fluxes is identified, factors that significantly influence stratification, circulation and renewal of the gulf. Based on the thermohaline properties, two dense water formation events (February 2000 and 2005), not previously reported, are detected and analyzed for the first time.","Hydrodynamic circulation,Dense water formation,Physical oceanography,Thermaikos Gulf,Stratification,Freshwater fluxes,"
"leveraging graph and deep learning uncertainties to detect anomalous maritime trajectories","2022","Understanding and representing traffic patterns are key to detecting anomalous trajectories in the transportation domain. However, some trajectories can exhibit heterogeneous maneuvering characteristics despite confining to normal patterns. Thus, we propose a novel graph-based trajectory representation and association scheme for extraction and confederation of traffic movement patterns, such that data patterns and uncertainty can be learned by deep learning (DL) models. This paper proposes the usage of a recurrent neural network (RNN)-based evidential regression model, which can predict trajectory at future timesteps as well as estimate the data and model uncertainties associated, to detect anomalous maritime trajectories, such as unusual vessel maneuvering, using automatic identification system (AIS) data. Furthermore, we utilize evidential deep learning classifiers to detect unusual turns of vessels and the loss of transmitted signal using predicted class probabilities with associated uncertainties. Our experimental results suggest that the graphical representation of traffic patterns improves the ability of the DL models, such as evidential and Monte Carlo dropout, to learn the temporal-spatial correlation of data and associated uncertainties. Using different datasets and experiments, we demonstrate that the estimated prediction uncertainty yields fundamental information for the detection of traffic anomalies in the maritime and, possibly in other domains.","Monte Carlo methods,classification,recurrent neural nets,graph,deep learning (artificial intelligence),Anomaly detection,DL models,graph-based trajectory representation,automatic identification system data,Monte Carlo dropout,graphical representation,traffic movement patterns,detect anomalous maritime trajectories,Predictive models,regression analysis,evidential deep learning,marine engineering,Data models,data patterns,pattern classification,Artificial intelligence,graph theory,RNN,regression,clustering,uncertainty,Trajectory,Uncertainty,probability,Computational modeling,traffic engineering computing,recurrent neural network-based evidential regression model,deep learning uncertainties,AIS data,"

"modeling and simulation in support of understanding maritime security and defense capabilities and requirements (the maritime timeline and analysis requirements toolset (m-tart))","2011","Those responsible for the Maritime Security of North America face a daunting task. The breadth of activities in the maritime domain makes it very difficult to achieve an acceptable level of understanding and control. This leaves decision makers to deal with a multi-national challenge that is very much connected to the aerospace, land and cyberspace domains. In order for the decision makers responsible for the Maritime Security and Defense of North America to effectively execute their missions, they require both an understanding of their current capabilities and gaps, and a means to determine the capability requirements to close any identified gaps. This paper presents the Maritime Timeline Analysis and Requirements Toolset (M-TART) as a modeling and simulation solution to address this problem. The M-TART is a deterministic, scenario-based model that accounts for the various states of the maritime event timeline and provides decision makers with statistical and graphical information regarding current capabilities and gaps.","computer graphics,maritime defense,cyberspace domain,Maritime Security of North America,aerospace domain,Monitoring,maritime security,military computing,graphical information,Force,Availability,Oceans,land domain,maritime timeline and analysis requirements toolset,Probability,Security,statistical information,maritime event timeline,Analytical models,statistics,"
"a method for maritime target tracking based on kernelized spectral filter","2022","Maritime target tracking can be applied in the fields of intelligent marine transportation and resource protection. The spectral filter tracking method focuses on the adaptability of the local appearance changes of targets, with the graph representation. Considering the complexity and diversity of the marine environment, we propose a maritime target tracking algorithm based on kernelized spectral filter. The spectral filtering is modeled as a tracking framework based on kernel regression. According to graph signal processing and spectral graph theory, based on the description of kernel regression on graph signals, we deduce and discuss the construction of the filter, the calculation of kernel matrix, the solution of kernel regression model, and the prediction of tracking position. With the help of a nonlinear model, it can effectively improve the precision under complex tracking conditions. The experimental results on the benchmark dataset verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, especially when the target tracking is affected by waves or wakes.","graph representation,graph signal processing,matrix algebra,Feature extraction,intelligent transportation systems,kernel regression,Predictive models,regression analysis,kernel matrix,Filtering algorithms,Filtering,target tracking,position tracking,Target tracking,spectral filter tracking method,particle filtering (numerical methods),kernelized spectral filter,Signal processing,graph theory,kernel regression model,spectral graph theory,resource protection,spectral filtering,Signal processing algorithms,maritime target tracking,intelligent marine transportation,"
