"ship anti-grounding with a maritime autonomous surface ship and digital twin of port of hamburg","2023","We present the virtual demonstration of a novel ship Anti-Grounding Service in a digital twinned use case scenario in the Port of Hamburg. The scenario is generated from real bathymetry survey data collected in the Port. The virtual model of a Maritime Autonomous Surface Ship travels the route ahead of merchant ships on approach to the Port and is integrated with a real-time high-resolution Multibeam SONAR Simulator that synthesizes underkeel survey data. The automated data processing workflow detects potential grounding hazards in the synthetic survey data and provides a real-time update of the Port nautical chart, which is presented in the Electronic Chart Display and Information System of a Ship Handling Simulator. Our method is the first to consider Multibeam SONAR equipped Maritime Autonomous Surface Ship platforms for provision of ship Anti-Grounding Services. The results validate the full-scale simulation and automated hazard detection workflow and incorporate tests conducted with certified mariners (N=10) to address human factors of introducing new technologies into safety critical situations. The key contributions of this work are summarized as: 1) Validation of Maritime Autonomous Surface Ships as an Anti-Grounding Service delivery platform; 2) Demonstration of a Digital Twin for hydrography survey and bottom hazard detection; and 3) Experimental validation with certified mariners of the anti-grounding service Human-Computer Interface on the ship bridge.","digital twinned use case scenario,automated data processing workflow,ship antigrounding service,underkeel survey data,electronic chart display,Bridges,human factors,bathymetry survey data,safety,grounding hazards,antigrounding service delivery platform,hydrography,Surveys,digital twins,ships,marine safety,maritime autonomous surface ship platforms,autonomous,port nautical chart,synthetic survey data,Seaports,object detection,automated hazard detection workflow,simulation,digital twin,ship handling simulator,sonar,unmanned vehicle,Autonomous aerial vehicles,bathymetry,Real-time systems,antigrounding service human-computer interface,real-time high-resolution multibeam SONAR simulator,merchant ship,Hazards,hazards,Hamburg port,SONAR,ports,navigation,Digital twins,merchant ships,oceanographic techniques,ship bridge,"
"evaluation of the effectiveness of co-processors gpu-based in solving of generating sea waves in the operation simulation model of unmanned maritime vehicles","2023","The article considers the matters of developing the models of the bottom sonar survey applying unmanned surface vehicles. The purpose of the work is the assessment of the efficiency of applying available firmware means to conduct computer-intense calculations when using simulation model. Within the work, the main attention was paid to considering the process of forming the sea surface at various parameters of the environment as one of the most resource-intense in the simulation model from the point of view of computation efforts. It is shown that the whole process of the sea surface forming can be kept to the determined stages. The result of the process of forming is a map of the surface peaks. The sea surface forming process can be performed both in sequential and parallel form, whereat some computing blocks can be performed with use of distributed systems. The work has carried out the estimation of the calculation time in implementing the sequential process on the general-purpose processing units of architecture x86 applying OpenCV library, and also of the parallel process applying Nvidia graphics processing units supported by the CUDA technology. The computational experiments conducted for various general-purpose processing units and graphic processors issued during the period from 2010 to 2021 has shown that the use of graphic computing units allows increasing the speed of performing the stage of the complex values of frequencies amplitudes by 20 times, while in performing the stage of an inverse Fourier transform the speed is increased 3 times at average.","CUDA,Fourier transform,Sea surface,sonar systems,Computational modeling,Atmospheric modeling,unmanned maritime vehicles,Surveys,sea surface,Industries,Surface waves,Graphics,"
"satellite-derived bathymetry for maritime archaeology: testing its effectiveness at two ancient harbours in the eastern mediterranean","2021","High-resolution bathymetry is an essential tool in maritime archaeology, often used for underwater prospection, imaging, palaeo-landscape reconstruction and change detection. The commonest acquisition method relies on shipborne acoustic systems (e.g. multibeam echosounder). However, most of the world’s seabed has not been surveyed using these methods. Derivation of bathymetry from high-resolution multispectral satellite imagery (Satellite-Derived Bathymetry: SDB) can redress this in shallow (<20–30 m depth) clear water. It can be derived empirically using depth control points, or independent of control data through physics-based approaches. Given global satellite coverage, it is applicable almost anywhere with suitable water conditions and is becoming increasingly widespread in the hydrographic survey community. However, archaeological application of SDB is almost totally un-investigated. This paper examines the utility of SDB for maritime archaeology through 2 case studies: the ancient harbours of Tyre (Lebanon) and Ras Ibn Hani (Syria). Tested data comprise 2 m-resolution physics-based commercial SDB and medium-resolution (10–30 m) SDB empirically derived from open access multispectral imagery (Landsat 8, Sentinel-2). SDB was assessed for its ability to detect submerged cultural features and landforms and as input into palaeo-geographic reconstructions. Tested SDB performed poorly for feature detection, but was better-suited to landform identification and palaeo-geographic reconstruction. SDB also has clear advantages: low cost, wide area coverage, speed and data availability. Disadvantages include variable accuracy, technical limitations (e.g. need for clear water) and approach-specific requirements (e.g. depth control points for empirical and complex modelling for physics-based approaches). For maritime archaeology, its current limitations means that it will not replace acoustics for prospection and imaging but it does have utility for submerged landscape investigation and reconstruction, particularly in areas which now only have no/poor bathymetric data.","Bathymetry,SDB,Submerged landscapes,Geoarchaeology,Shipwrecks,Satellite imagery,"

"a novel approach to automate surrounding ships in a virtual maritime environment","2014","Full mission marine training scenarios are essential in training marine trainees with ship handling simulators. In a good training simulation not only the static environment but also the dynamic surrounding ships plays a major role in terms of behaviour realism. The surrounding ships also need to navigate according to COLREG (Convention on International Regulation for Preventing Collisions at Sea) navigational rules. This research presents a novel approach to automate the surrounding vessels in a marine simulation environment with a central controller to control the behaviours of each surrounding vessel in the marine environment. The controller uses positioning data of real ships which are derived from a set of historical Automatic Identification System (AIS) data and map the positioning data with the surrounding ships in virtual environment to obtain the navigation. An Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm is used to avoid the collisions by generating a new path when both trainee's ship and surrounding ships are in the vicinity of each other. The collision handling mechanism uses COLREG rules. The ACO algorithm generates successful collision avoided paths in all head-on, crossing and over-taking encountering situations. The number of turning points is used to measure the smoothness of the path and number of obstacles in the environment and number of nodes in the graph affects the smoothness of the path. With these results it is revealed that AIS data can be used as an assistant to automate surrounding vessels in a virtual maritime environment together with a proper collision avoidance mechanism.","head-on situations,collision handling mechanism,virtual maritime environment,ACO algorithm,crossing situations,virtual reality,ant colony optimization,target ships,ant colony optimisation,over-taking encountering situations,surrounding ships automation,marine navigation,Radio frequency,surrounding ships,ship handling simulators,ships,Automatic Identification System,AIS,surrounding vessels,Convention on International Regulation for Preventing Collisions at Sea,central controller,marine simulation environment,collision avoidance,Ant Colony Optimization (ACO),autonomous navigation,historical AIS data,COLREG navigational rules,"
"assessment of marine litter through remote sensing: recent approaches and future goals","2021","This bibliographic review provides an overview of techniques used to detect marine litter using remote sensing. The review classified studies in terms of platform (satellite, aircrafts, drones), sensors (passive or active), spectral (visible, infrared, microwaves), spatial resolution (<1 to >30 m), type and size (macroplastics, microplastics), or classification methodology (sighting, photointerpretation, supervised). Most studies applied satellite information to address marine litter using multi- and hyper- spectral optical sensors. The correspondence analysis on analyzed variables exhibited that aircrafts with high spatial resolution (<3 m) with optical sensors (λ = 400 to 2500 nm) seem to be the most optimum combination to target marine litter, while satellites carrying Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensors (λ = 3.1 to 5.6 cm) may detect sea-slicks associated to surfactants that might contain high concentration of microplastics. Gaps indicate that future goals in marine litter detection should be addressed with platforms including optical and SAR sensors.","SAR,Remote sensing,Sea-slicks,Marine plastic litter,Optical sensors,"
"subterranea: notes on the notion of a geopolitical unconscious","2022","New technologies are increasingly making it possible to colonize and inhabit realms previously deemed beyond-the-human. While airspace and maritime spaces feature particularly prominently in these larger geopolitical formations, subterranean spaces have not elicited the same levels of dynamism, anxiety, or excitement. Unlike air or water, subterranean spaces are often imagined to be static and inhibitive of movement, and are therefore less amenable to geopolitical mobilizations. Focusing precisely on this absence, the paper will look at the subterranean as spatial metaphor for what remains unspoken, unexplored, or forcibly repressed in geopolitical narratives. In doing so, the argument will touch upon nonhuman geographies, insularity, and the “monstrous” through two examples of subterranean sites, namely the UK/France Channel Tunnel and the Korean DMZ.","Unconscious,Cutaneity,Monsters,Tunnels,Concorporate,Geopolitics,"
"precise positioning using stand-alone gps for maritime application","2012","The geographical position of the sea floor, the depth of the water, and the heights of bridges, facilities, and vessel mainmasts are currently determined using tidal data that are time-dependent and not very accurate. Disasters due to global warming and rising sea levels have increased casualties as well. As such, a warning system is required for freak events such as tsunami. To avoid such accidents, safe maritime applications are needed to determine the overhead clearance of vessels and wave height in real time using precise positioning technology. This paper proposes architectures for secure safe maritime applications. It also evaluates a software platform for precise positioning using measurements acquired in a test bed.","Satellites,warning system,disasters,seafloor phenomena,Stand-alone GPS,Tsunami,tides,tidal data,seawater,Global Positioning System,Sea measurements,real time system,global warming,ocean waves,safe maritime applications,real-time systems,Safe maritime application,Extraterrestrial measurements,software platform,sea levels,Precise positioning,seafloor geographical position,Orbits,Clocks,sea level,precise positioning technology,stand-alone GPS,wave height,Tsunami warning system,"
"research on ship abnormal behavior detection method based on graph neural network","2022","Because of the existing maritime intelligent supervision, ship abnormal behavior detection ignores the interdependence between different time series of ships and different abnormal behavior characteristics, which leads to poor real-time performance and limited detection accuracy of abnormal detection. This paper explores the mechanism of ship abnormal behavior monitoring and detection based on graph attention network. This mechanism uses a sliding window to generate fixed data input, uses graph attention network to capture the dependence between ship behavior characteristics, and determines the threshold of anomaly according to the sea environment set in this paper. In order to complete the online real-time detection of ship abnormal behavior with multivariate and multidimensional time series, improve the accuracy of ship abnormal behavior detection and reduce the blind area of VTS (Vessel Traffic Service) system monitoring.","ship abnormal behavior monitoring,VTS system,sea environment set,graph attention network,multivariate time series,graph neural network,Marine vehicles,neural nets,Mechatronics,ships,marine safety,VTS system monitoring,multidimensional time series,sliding window,Data models,object detection,vessel traffic service,Time series analysis,existing maritime intelligent supervision,online real-time detection,Real-time systems,graph theory,time series,ship abnormal behavior detection method,Trajectory,maritime supervision,fixed data input generation,Cognition,traffic engineering computing,ship abnormal behavior detection,abnormal behavior characteristics,ship behavior characteristics,"
"ship path optimization that accounts for geographical traffic characteristics to increase maritime port safety","2022","Maritime ports face challenges associated with navigation safety, operational efficiency, and management. With the development of the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence simulation technologies, geographical information systems, and cloud computing technologies as well as navigation aids and decision support systems in maritime transportation, ports have the potential to better manage traffic, loading, and unloading. Recently, there has been growing attention in unmanned shipping to support the maritime industry and the military. This paper aims to extend the application of geographical theory and methodology in unmanned ship path optimization. Automatic collision avoidance concerning maneuvering capabilities of ships as well as complying with maritime traffic rules remains a challenge. This study attempts to tackle development needs associated with path optimization in maritime travel. By integrating ship movement behavior, geographical features, and the International Regulations for Avoiding Collisions at Sea, the proposed methods seek to reduce the human error associated with maritime accidents. This paper proposes economic efficiency and safety-driven unmanned ship path planning that will promote the future growth of intelligent port development.","automatic collision avoidance,decision support systems,marine accidents,ship maneuvering capabilities,Risk management,safety-driven unmanned ship path,Safety,Internet of Things,unmanned shipping,transportation,Marine vehicles,unmanned ship path optimization,control engineering computing,cloud computing technologies,geographical information systems,ship movement behavior,artificial intelligence simulation technologies,ships,Spatial-temporal traffic dynamics,marine safety,cloud computing,maritime transportation,collision risk,maritime traffic rules,Collision avoidance,navigation aids,Data models,optimisation,navigation safety,maritime port safety,sea ports,geographic information systems,intelligent port development,marine engineering computing,path optimization,Optimization,unmanned surface vehicles,maritime industry,Navigation,maritime accidents,collision avoidance,artificial intelligence,geographical traffic characteristics,geographical theory,"

"multiple strings planing problem in maritime service network: hyper-heuristic approach","2015","The service network design problems arising in liner shipping industry are very intractable problems. Several exact method are proposed for such problems where almost all of them are limited by the instance size that can be resolved. In this article, we consider the problem of designing multiple strings among a set of ports, in order to maximize the industry profit.

"assessment of the resilience of a complex network for crude oil transportation on the maritime silk road","2020","As one of the most strategically important natural resources, crude oil can be dangerous to transport by sea. The resilience of a maritime transport network denotes the ability of the system to withstand damage and remain operational after disturbances, representing the invulnerability of the network and its ability to recover from harm. In this study, we built a crude oil transportation network titled the Maritime Silk Road using Automatic Identification System (AIS) sensor data, designed a resilience assessment framework based on complex network theory, and assessed the resilience of the maritime crude oil transportation network from both qualitative and quantitative perspectives with the help of complex network metrics and a resilience model. The results show that the topology of the crude oil transportation network has a significant impact on its resilience, in that network density and centrality are negatively related to network resilience, whereas network connectivity and size are positively related to resilience. Subsequently, the resilience of crude oil transportation networks declines at a steady rate under random attacks but declines sharply under intentional attacks. Finally, a comprehensive analysis of invulnerability and recovery in the context of resilience concludes that strengthening small and medium-sized ports in the network is important to enhance network resilience. These results can provide reference and decision support for port planning, route design, optimization, and form a foundation for a more secure and reliable maritime transportation network system.","resilience assessment framework,Safety,maritime transport network,crude oil transportation network,complex network metrics,goods distribution,network resilience,Resilience,Maritime Silk Road,complex network theory,reliable maritime transportation network system,complex network,Oils,network connectivity,secure maritime transportation network system,network theory (graphs),Complex networks,Artificial intelligence,sea ports,crude oil,network density,Roads,maritime crude oil transportation network,mathematical analysis,petroleum industry,complex networks,AIS data,maritime silk road,"

"cyber risk perception in the maritime domain: a systematic literature review","2021","This paper aims to present an approach to investigate cyber risk perception with use of recognized psychological models, and to give an overview of state-of-the-art research within the field of cyber risk perception in general and in the context of the maritime domain. The focus will be on determinative dimensions within the psychometric paradigm and cognitive biases, and to give recommendations on further research within these fields. Okoli and Schabramâ€™s eight-step guide to plan, select, extract, and execute a systematic literature review is used as guidance. The search process resulted in 25 relevant articles which describes 24 dimensions of cyber risk perception in different online environments. Research within the area of maritime cyber security is increasing, however, no studies relevant for our literature review were found within the maritime domain. The nine dimensions in the psychometric model, perceived benefit and the optimistic bias is presented and discussed in a maritime context. Cyber risk perception is a complex research-area where both determinative factors and other cognitive processes can be influenced by each other. This can indicate that the dimensions differ across populations and professions, creating grounds for why context-specific studies are important. Further research may benefit from more multidisciplinary, descriptive, and inductive approaches, and contextual studies within maritime cyber risk perception can contribute to develop targeted tools for risk mitigation to enhance safety at sea.","risk perception,Safety,online environments,systematic literature review,maritime cyber risk perception,human behavior,security of data,human factors,psychology,Cyberspace,cognition,search process,Bibliographies,marine safety,psychological models,marine engineering,cognitive biases,project management,Computer crime,cognitive processes,maritime cyber security,cyberpsychology,risk analysis,Psychology,psychometric paradigm,Maritime cyber security,Tools,risk communication,Systematics,"
"graph representation learning with encoding edges","2019","Network embedding aims at learning the low dimensional representation of nodes. These representations can be widely used for network mining tasks, such as link prediction, anomaly detection, and classification. Recently, a great deal of meaningful research work has been carried out on this emerging network analysis paradigm. The real-world network contains different size clusters because of the edges with different relationship types. These clusters also reflect some features of nodes, which can contribute to the optimization of the feature representation of nodes. However, existing network embedding methods do not distinguish these relationship types. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised network representation learning model that can encode edge relationship information. Firstly, an objective function is defined, which can learn the edge vectors by implicit clustering. Then, a biased random walk is designed to generate a series of node sequences, which are put into Skip-Gram to learn the low dimensional node representations. Extensive experiments are conducted on several network datasets. Compared with the state-of-art baselines, the proposed method is able to achieve favorable and stable results in multi-label classification and link prediction tasks.","Edge representation,Feature learning,Network mining,Network embedding,"
"maritime containers tracking trial results","2009","There are approximately 7 million maritime-style containers within Canada, and 70 million within the US. The interiors of such containers are rarely inspected. With market globalization, a large amount of these containers enter North America on a daily basis. Such containers may include contraband or dangerous items that present an economic or security risk. Despite significant security improvements, only 3 to 5 % of the maritime containers, that arrive in, or transition through, North America, go through physical inspection. Current container tracking technologies based on GPS consume high DC power, are costly, require line-of-sight with satellites, and are often too large to be covert. It is possible to overcome some of these limitations by basing the tracking system on the FM broadcast signal which is an alternative man-made signal that is reasonably ubiquitous, provides a geographically-unique frequency spectrum and is about 100,000 times as strong as a GPS satellite signal. This allows the development of a low-cost, low-power and miniature FM receiver that can record frequency spectrums and compare them to known data in order to trace the path that the container has taken for less than $10 per container. This presents the first results of highway trials (train and sea trials are currently being conducted) of such a low-cost, covert, non-GPS based technology (called 'FM Tag') that records the worldwide displacement of containers and displays the path undertaken by the container while in transit. As an added security benefit, the tag is also capable of detecting container door openings. In addition to presenting the first trial results, this covers the innovative engineering aspects of using the metal enclosure of a maritime container as a VBF antenna, thereby eliminating the need to add an external antenna and achieving the goal of being 100% covert.","maritime containers tracking,US,Inspection,Canada,VHF antennas,Global Positioning System,FM broadcast signal,metal enclosure,Containers,Globalization,frequency spectrum,containers,market globalization,GPS,Satellite broadcasting,North America,Frequency,Road transportation,container tracking technologies,VHP antenna,Power generation economics,Security,"
"cancerous diseases in aquatic animals and their association with environmental pollutants: a critical literature review","1986","This review of the literature on neoplastic or cancer-like disorders in fish and shellfish sets out to (1) summarize what is known of the occurrence of neoplastic diseases in indigenous populations of aquatic animals found in different geographic areas of the world; (2) critically evaluate existing reports so as to determine whether or not environmental pollutants are implicated as causal agents of the cellular disorders and (3) describe the current state of knowledge in the general areas of fish and shellfish metabolism and the use of aquatic animal models in studies of chemical carcinogenesis. Tumors and neoplasms have been described in fish and shellfish populations from many areas throughout the world. Although environmental pollutants have been suggested as the cause of neoplasms in at least some cases, the existing evidence does not permit a firm conclusion. For fish, the quality of the reports and data reviewed varied considerably. There are rather good experimental data to suggest that cancer-like conditions in fish from certain areas of Puget Sound (Washington), the Fox River (Illinois) and Japan are associated with chemical contaminants in the environment. The data purported to support a chemical etiology for highly publicized tumors in fish from the Buffalo River, Torch Lake and Black River are not of a high quality. Most of the studies from those areas are compromised by inadequate experimental designs, and further research will be necessary to achieve a more complete in relation to the existence of tumors in fish from those areas. There are also reports providing impressive evidence that chemical pollutants are not associated with neoplasms in fish, even in those inhibiting environments known to contain mutagenic substances. Large surveys conducted from highly polluted aquatic systems in Yugoslavia (Sava River), Germany (Rhine and Elbe Rivers) and Australia (Port Phillip Bay) all reported negative results. Many other studies and surveys have produced data that neither supported nor refuted a pollution-neoplasm association. In contrast to fish, there is little evidence that neoplasms of clams, oysters and mussels are associated in any significant way with environmental pollution. The most obvious conclusion, from reviewing the existing literature, is that much additional research is required before the relationship(s) between environmental pollution and neoplasms in indigenous aquatic species can be understood. There are severe constraints associated with conducting credible field studies in this area, given the incalculable number of variables in natural environments. In the future, it may be advisable to place more emphasis on laboratory studies employing state-of-the-art methods to provide fundamental information that can be used to understand the nature and causes of neoplasms in aquatic species.",""
"augmenting and complementing current maritime domain awareness systems within the gulf of mexico using fiber optic network systems","2002","For the maritime domain awareness in the Gulf of Mexico region, accurate information, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance of vessels, cargo and people is paramount to safely maintain the multitude of physical, biological and socio-economic parameters. In this region of heavy interdependent use, the Gulf of Mexico cradles many of the environmental and economic interactions for the continental United States. It provides sanctuary to countless biological species, contains energy resources and allows efficient transportation of economic goods and cargo. Any disruption to this area would be catastrophic, with complicated and far-reaching effects. Currently, the resources that provide monitoring and allow intervention are provided by multi agency organizations and are finite and limited. It is proposed that addition of a fiber optic network system will augment and complement these resources allowing real time data capture and expanded risk management decision making capability. Well placed within the geographic region of the Gulf is an already installed fiber optic system called FiberWeb. It encircles the heart of the oil and gas production in the Gulf of Mexico, running from the tip of Louisiana to the Texas coast, along the continental shelf, with an intended purpose of providing secure, reliable and expendable communications link between offshore production facilities and onshore bases.

Although this topic has been extensively researched, the navigational situation of vessels has received little attention. However, such a navigational situation is essential for understanding water bodies and ensuring maritime safety. To provide effective navigation information, this study first analyzes the actual situation of vessel traffic using Automatic Identification System (AIS) data. Operators can be based on the analysis to understand the trend of navigation ships in water bodies as an important reference. From the results of the analysis, we constructed a representable navigational information system. Different information was unified on a Geographical Information System (GIS) in two-and three-dimensional formats. The system was demonstrated in a navigation simulation of a real voyage ship in Osaka Bay, Japan. The integrated information can be comprehensively and realistically interpreted by operators.

First, we measured the seasonal dynamic of the vegetation index PVI using a time series of seasonal reflectance data acquired from 2002 to 2007 with the VEGETATION radiometer. Also, we monitored the seasonal changes of LAI and fAPAR of the understory and tree canopy layers from ground measurements with hemispherical photographs and PAR sensors on four sites, which were representative of the different ecological conditions found in 'Les Landes'. Finally, we compared the seasonal dynamic of PVI with the seasonal dynamic of LAI and fAPAR measured for both layers. The first results showed that the seasonal variation of PVI could mainly be explained by the seasonal variation of LAI and fAPAR of understory vegetation.","radiometer,remote sensing,atmospheric radiation,AD 2002 to 2007,VEGETATION sensor,atmospheric boundary layer,satellite sensor,remote sensing observation,VEGETATION,radiometry,maritime pine forest,Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer,photosynthesis,fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation,fAPAR,PVI,sensors,Les Landes,hemispherical photograph,vegetation,MODIS,PAR measurement,southwestern France,LAI,seasonal dynamics,ecology,Photosynthetically active radiation,tree canopy,leaf area index,seasonal reflectance data,understory,ecology condition,vegetation index,Reflectivity,Northern Hemisphere,phenology,"

Big data from heterogeneous sources such as sensors, buoys, vessels, and satellites could potentially fuel a large number of interesting applications for environmental protection, security, fault prediction, shipping routes optimization, and energy production. However, because of several challenges related to big data and the high heterogeneity of the data sources, such applications are still underdeveloped and fragmented. In this paper, we analyze challenges and requirements related to big maritime data applications and propose a scalable data management solution.

"spatial ontologies for detecting abnormal maritime behaviour","2012","The upsurge in piracy and the impact of recent environmental disasters have highlighted the need to improve maritime surveillance. Governmental and private initiatives have developed monitoring systems with improved acquisition and analysis capabilities. These systems rely on one major component, namely the detection of abnormal ship behaviour. This implies a detailed formalisation of expert knowledge. However, the quantity of data, the complexity of situations, the failure to take into account their spatial characteristics and the potential for the same scenario to be interpreted in different ways have proved to be significant problems.

"unsupervised maritime traffic graph learning with mean-reverting stochastic processes","2018","Inspired by the fair regularity of the motion of ships, we present a method to derive a representation of the commercial maritime traffic in the form of a graph, whose nodes represent way-point areas, or regions of likely direction changes, and whose edges represent navigational legs with constant cruise velocity. The proposed method is based on the representation of a ship's velocity with an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process and on the detection of changes of its long-run mean to identify navigational way-points. In order to assess the graph representativeness of the traffic, two performance metrics are introduced, leading to distinct graph construction criteria. Finally, the proposed method is validated against real-world Automatic Identification System data collected in a large area.","real-world data,Clustering algorithms,Anomaly detection,unsupervised learning,graph construction criteria,Marine vehicles,mean-reverting stochastic processes,unsupervised maritime traffic graph learning,Stochastic processes,maritime situational awareness,DBSCAN,Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process,change detection,ships,automatic identification system,stochastic processes,motion control,AIS,navigational legs,maritime traffic graph,Artificial intelligence,velocity control,graph theory,constant cruise velocity,Legged locomotion,clustering,graph representativeness,Navigation,navigation,graph learning,navigational way-points,ship velocity,"
"an ecosystem-based approach to evaluate the ecological quality of mediterranean undersea caves","2015","A theoretical model of structure and functioning was constructed for the Mediterranean undersea cave ecosystem. This model integrates almost all representative components of the cave ecosystem and gives an idea of their faunal compositions, characteristics and related interactions. This model constitutes the basis of the Ecosystem-Based Quality Index (EBQI) of the European Union's Marine Strategy Framework Directive, which aims at evaluating the ecological quality of an ecosystem. It is based on four crucial complementary elements: (i) each component was weighted in accordance with its importance in determining the structure and functioning of the cave ecosystem; (ii) a suite of relevant parameters were defined to assess the ecological state of each component of the cave ecosystem; (iii) these parameters were aggregated into one relevant index, the Cave EBQI (CavEBQI), to summarize the quality evaluation for each cave site; (iv) each value of ecological state is accompanied by a Confidence Index as a measure of its reliability. The CavEBQI was used on 22 Mediterranean undersea caves of France and Italy. Disparities of ecological quality were found among caves but most of them ranged from moderate to high ecological quality. For some caves, no conclusion can be drawn when our method predicts a poor reliability of the evaluation of their ecological quality. This ecosystem-based evaluation of the quality of undersea caves seems to be a powerful tool, with the advantage of being based on almost all its components, rather than just on a few species. It is accompanied by a measure of its reliability, hence it provides a reliable idea of the ecological state of the entire ecosystem at each cave site. Monitoring the ecological state of caves and the effects of disturbances over large geographic and temporal scales is made possible with CavEBQI. Applying the same method to other ecosystems, can provide an integrated view of a marine region, which is essential when addressing questions about protection, conservation and restoration.","Mediterranean Sea,Ecological quality,Marine Strategy Framework Directive,Underwater marine caves,Undersea caves,Ecosystem-based quality index,"
"tightly coupled, graph-based dvl/imu fusion and decoupled mapping for slam-centric maritime infrastructure inspection","2023","In this article, we address the problem of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM)-centric maritime infrastructure inspection [using unmanned surface vehicles (USVs)] via novel approaches in tightly-coupled, graph-based DVL/IMU fusion and decoupled mapping. As our first contribution, we formalize the preintegration of linear velocity measurements, obtained by a Doppler velocity log (DVL), in combination with angular velocity measurements, obtained by an inertial measurement unit (IMU), as binary factors encoding relative position. To evaluate state estimation improvements imparted by DVL/IMU fusion, we implement our proposed factor within a state-of-the-art, graph-based lidar-visual-inertial (LVI) SLAM system as our second contribution. Accuracy and robustness improvements are demonstrated in simulation by comparing maximum a posteriori pose estimates with and without DVL/IMU fusion against ground truth poses. As our third contribution, we propose a map generation framework for downstream inspection applications decoupled from SLAM. In our framework, volumetric data (captured by sonar, lidar, etc.) is transformed into a common world coordinate frame using extrinsic calibrations and SLAM pose estimates as input. Our framework operates over the complete set of raw volumetric data, whereas SLAM systems (both online and offline) typically operate over a subset of down-sampled volumetric data. To address the processing of additional volumetric data, we present innovations in refined pose correction and staged filtering for user-controlled denoising. We experimentally evaluate our map generation framework against the LVI SLAM system adopted for this study using real-world data and demonstrate improvements to map quality metrics important to inspection.","decoupled mapping,sensor fusion,Inspection,robot vision,unmanned surface vehicles (USVs),SLAM (robots),LVI SLAM system,Sea measurements,Laser radar,Doppler velocity log,SLAM systems,inspection,pose estimation,Simultaneous localization and mapping,angular velocity measurements,inertial measurement unit,graph-based lidar-visual-inertial SLAM system,state estimation,map generation framework,SLAM-centric maritime infrastructure inspection,mapping,Sonar,optical radar,Robustness,map quality metrics,state estimation improvements,unmanned surface vehicles,calibration,Velocity measurement,mobile robots,downstream inspection applications,linear velocity measurements,simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM),velocity measurement,"
"mining vessel tracking data for maritime domain applications","2016","The growing number of remote sensing systems and ship reporting technologies (e.g. Automatic Identification System, Long Range Identification and Tracking, radar tracking, Earth Observation) are generating an overwhelming amount of spatio-temporal and geographically distributed data related to vessels and their movements. Research on reliable data mining techniques has proven essential to the discovery of knowledge from such increasingly available information on ship traffic at sea. Data driven knowledge discovery has very recently demonstrated its value in fields that go beyond the original maritime safety and security remits of such data. They include, but are not limited to, fisheries management, maritime spatial planning, gridding ship emissions, mapping activities at sea, risk assessment of offshore platforms, and trade indicators. The extraction of useful information from maritime Big Data is thus a key element in providing operational authorities, policy-makers and scientists with supporting tools to understand what is happening at sea and improve maritime knowledge. This work will provide a survey of the recent JRC research activities relevant to automatic anomaly detection and knowledge discovery in the maritime domain. Data mining, data analytics and predictive analysis examples are introduced using real data.

"holocene interaction of maritime and continental climate in central europe: new speleothem evidence from central germany","2019","Central European climate is strongly influenced by North Atlantic (Westerlies) and Siberian High circulation patterns, which govern precipitation and temperature dynamics and induce heterogeneous climatic conditions, with distinct boundaries between climate zones. These climate boundaries are not stationary and shift geographically, depending on long-term atmospheric conditions. So far, little is known about past shifts of these climate boundaries and the local to regional environmental response prior to the instrumental era. High resolution multi-proxy data (stable oxygen and carbon isotope ratios, S/Ca and Sr/Ca) from two Holocene stalagmites from Bleßberg Cave (Thuringia) are used here to differentiate local and pan-regional environmental and climatic conditions Central Germany through the Holocene. Carbon isotope and S/Ca and Sr/Ca ratios inform us on local Holocene environmental changes in and around the cave, while δ18O (when combined with independent records) serves as proxy for (pan-)regional atmospheric conditions. The stable carbon isotope record suggests repeated changes in vegetation density (open vs. dense forest), and increasing forest cover in the late Holocene. Concurrently, decreasing S/Ca values indicate more effective sulfur retention in better developed soils, with a stabilization in the mid-Holocene. This goes in hand with changes in effective summer infiltration, reflected in the Sr/Ca profile. Highest Sr/Ca values between 4 ka and 1 ka BP indicate intensified prior calcite precipitation resulting from reduced effective moisture supply. The region of Bleßberg Cave is sensitive to shifts of the boundary between maritime (Cfb) and continental (Dfb) climate and ideally suited to reconstruct past meridional shifts of this divide. We combined the Bleßberg Cave δ18O time series with δ18O data from Bunker Cave (western Germany) and a North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) record from lake SS1220 (SW Greenland) to reconstruct the mean position of the Cfb-Dfb climate boundary. We further estimate the dynamic interplay of the North Atlantic Oscillation and the Siberian High and their influence on Central European climate. Repeated shifts of the Cfb-Dfb boundary over the last 4000 years might explain previously observed discrepancies between proxy records from Europe. Detailed correlation analyses reveal multi-centennial scale alternations of maritime and continental climate and, concurrently, waning and waxing influences of Siberian High and NAO on Central Europe.","S/Ca,Speleothem,Climate boundary,Sr/Ca,Oxygen isotopes,Palaeoclimate,Germany,Continental climate,Carbon isotopes,Holocene,Maritime climate,"
"diapycnal diffusivity in the core and oxycline of the tropical north atlantic oxygen minimum zone","2016","Diapycnal diffusivity estimates from two Tracer Release Experiments (TREs) and microstructure measurements in the oxycline and core of the oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) in the Eastern Tropical North Atlantic (ETNA) are compared. For the first time, two TREs within the same area at different depths were realized: the Guinea Upwelling Tracer Release Experiment (GUTRE) initiated in 2008 in the oxycline at approximately 320m depth, and the Oxygen Supply Tracer Release Experiment (OSTRE) initiated in 2012 in the core of the OMZ at approximately 410m depth. The mean diapycnal diffusivity Dz was found to be insignificantly smaller in the OMZ core with (1.06±0.24)×10−5m2s−1 compared to (1.11±0.22)×10−5m2s−1 90m shallower in the oxycline. Unexpectedly, GUTRE tracer was detected during two of the OSTRE surveys which showed that the estimated diapycnal diffusivity from GUTRE over a time period of seven years was within the uncertainty of the previous estimates over a time period of three years. The results are consistent with the Dz estimates from microstructure measurements and demonstrate that Dz does not vary significantly vertically in the OMZ within the depth range of 200–600m and does not change with time. The presence of a seamount chain in the vicinity of the GUTRE injection region did not cause enhanced Dz compared to the smoother bottom topography of the OSTRE injection region, although the analysis of vertical shear spectra from ship ADCP data showed elevated internal wave energy level in the seamount vicinity. However, the two tracer patches covered increasingly overlapping areas with time and thus spatially integrated increasingly similar fields of local diffusivity, as well as the difference in local stratification counteracted the influence of roughness on Dz. For both experiments no significant vertical displacements of the tracer were observed, thus diapycnal upwelling within the ETNA OMZ is below the uncertainty level of 5myr−1.","Tropical Atlantic,Guinea Dome,Tracers,Diffusion coefficients,Upwelling,Oxygen minimum zone,Ventilation,"

"an intelligent maritime scene frame prediction based on digital twins technology","2021","This paper proposes a scene frame prediction system based on digital twin technology. The system is mainly composed of an unmanned perception module, a communication link module, a command center module that provides intelligent computing services, and an interaction and visualization module for human operators.

"graph-based ship traffic partitioning for intelligent maritime surveillance in complex port waters","2023","Maritime Situational Awareness (MSA) is a critical component of intelligent maritime traffic surveillance. However, it becomes increasingly challenging to gain MSA accurately given the growing complexity of ship traffic patterns due to multi-ship interactions possibly involving classical manned ships and emerging autonomous ships. This study proposes a new traffic partitioning methodology to realise the optimal maritime traffic partition in complex waters. The methodology combines conflict criticality and spatial distance to generate conflict-connected and spatially compact traffic clusters, thereby improving the interpretability of traffic patterns and supporting ship anti-collision risk management. First, a composite similarity measure is designed using a probabilistic conflict detection approach and a newly formulated maritime traffic route network learned through maritime knowledge mining. Then, an extended graph-based clustering framework is used to produce balanced traffic clusters with high intra-connections but low inter-connections. The proposed methodology is thoroughly demonstrated and tested using Automatic Identification System (AIS) trajectory data in the Ningbo-Zhoushan Port. The experimental results show that the proposed methodology 1) has effective performance in decomposing the traffic complexity, 2) can assist in identifying high-risk/density traffic clusters, and 3) is sufficiently generic to handle various traffic scenarios in complex geographical waters. Therefore, this study makes significant contributions to intelligent maritime surveillance and provides a theoretical foundation for promoting maritime anti-collision risk management for the future mixed traffic of both manned and autonomous ships.","Graph partitioning,Intelligent maritime surveillance,Maritime safety,Maritime knowledge extraction,AIS data,"
"an integrated dynamic ship risk model based on bayesian networks and evidential reasoning","2021","The paper proposes a probabilistic framework for assessing the risk of ships based on a hybrid approach and multiple data sources. A Bayes-based network learning approach uses data from the New Inspection Regime of the Paris MoU on Port State Control to characterise the relationships among risk parameters and uses these parameters to evaluate the ship static risk. Other data sources are used to develop a Bayesian Network model to assess the dynamic risk of the ship. The data is aggregated by Bayesian Network and Evidential Reasoning approaches to evaluate the overall risk of ships in coastal waters. The objective of the study is to develop a model to assess the risk of an individual ship by considering its static risk profile and the geographical-dependant risk factors related to the characteristics of the maritime traffic flow and other local characteristics that influence the navigational risk of the ship. The results show that the integrated approach is able to assess the overall risk of a ship based on multiple data sources, providing empirical evidence of using multiple data sources in risk analysis applications. Moreover, the developed model identifies the most critical circumstances and the key impact factors in the study waters, which can support decisions on risk prevention and mitigation measures and local maritime traffic management.","Evidential Reasoning,Rule-based approach,Static and dynamic ship risk,Bayesian Networks,Automatic identification system data,Port State Control inspection data,Maritime risk analysis,"

"smoke aerosol transport patterns over the maritime continent","2013","Smoke transport patterns over the Maritime Continent (MC) are studied through a combination of approaches, including a) analyzing AODs obtained from satellite products; b) aerosol transport modeling with AOD assimilation along with the atmospheric flow patterns; c) analyzing smoke wet deposition distributions; and d) examining forward trajectories for smoke events defined in this study. It is shown that smoke transport pathways are closely related to the low-level atmospheric flow, i.e., during June–Sept, smoke originating from the MC islands with a dominant source over central and southern Sumatra, and southern and western Borneo, is generally transported northwestward south of the equator and northeastward north of the equator with the cross-equatorial flow, to the South China Sea (SCS), the Philippines and even further to the western Pacific. During the October–November transitional period, smoke transport paths are more zonally oriented compared to June–September. Smoke originating from Java, Bali, Timor etc, and southern New Guinea, which are in the domain of easterlies and southeasterlies during the boreal summer (June–November), is generally transported westward. It is also found that smoke transport over the MC exhibits multi-scale variability. Smoke typically lives longer and can be transported farther in El Niño years and later MJO phases compared with non El Niño years and earlier MJO phases. During El Niño periods there is much stronger westward transport to the east tropical Indian Ocean. Finally, orographic effect on smoke transport over the MC is also clearly discernable.","Aerosol transport,Smoke,El Niño,MJO,Smoke transport,Maritime Continent,"

Few, if any hydrographic surveys to modern standards have been performed in these areas other than along this specific route that was recently surveyed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Due to the large geographic areas involved and a lack of national assets, aids to navigation in the form of buoys, lights and other physical aids do not exist.

"the utility of body size indices derived from optical plankton counter data for the characterization of marine zooplankton assemblages","2012","To evaluate the utility of size-based indices derived from an Optical Plankton Counter (OPC) through detection of spatial and temporal trends in zooplankton biomass, zooplankton size data were collected with an OPC across the Scotian Shelf region of the northwest Atlantic Ocean in April and October of 1997, 1998, and 1999. Eight size-based indices were computed – three simple size metrics (arithmetic mean, geometric mean, coefficient of variation) and metrics derived from the Normalized Biomass Size Spectrum (NBSS; X- and Y-coordinates and curvature of a fitted quadratic function) and the Pareto distribution (Y-intercept and slope). Results indicate that the simple size indices and those derived from the Pareto distribution consistently accounted for the greatest portion of annual variation in zooplankton biomass whereas indices derived from the NBSS accounted only for some secondary patterns. Simple indices also accounted for the greatest portion of spatial variance in zooplankton biomass whereas the NBSS and Pareto accounted for secondary patterns. Patterns in zooplankton communities based on these indices reflected broad taxonomic trends and were related to independent observations on atmospheric and hydrographic conditions in the study area. Size-based zooplankton data from continuous survey instruments can provide powerful adjuncts to both freshwater and marine aquatic monitoring.","Pareto distribution,Optical Plankton Counter,Zooplankton,Body-size index,Scotian Shelf,Size spectrum,"
"a methodology to improve the assessment of vulnerability on the maritime supply chain of energy","2015","The globalization of trade is due to the transportation possibilities and the standardization (containerization of freight). The dependency of the economy to the sea and to the merchant navy has increase this last decade. This process forms a worldwide maritime network between the different locations of production and consumption. This network, representing between 80 % and 90% of world traffic is a major economic concern, including freight distribution, raw materials or energy. Rodrigue demonstrates[1] the economic dependency of energy is increasing in the industrialized countries (North America, Europe, East Asia). The inter-regional trade of oil was 31 million bbl/day in 2002 and is expected to grow up to 57 bbl/day in 2030 [2]. Most of the international traffic use a maritime way, where may occur disruptions. For example, the Suez crisis (1956-1957) caused a closure of the canal, reducing the throughput capacity of transportation. This disruption cost a 2 millions of barrels lost per day.

"a geospatial hub to support wind energy and maritime activity spaces near hampton roads, virginia, u.s.a.","2022","The urgent need for clean, sustainable energy development prompts the Commonwealth of Virginia (U.S.A.) to support the development of wind energy in state and federal waters. The port of Hampton Roads is a vital region for maritime commerce, recreation, and national defense, and the state also aims to avert wind development impacts on national security. This project assessed the state of marine geodata portals and decisionsupport methods for wind energy siting and developed a solution to inform energy developers, military stakeholders, and state and local government. An interdisciplinary team developed a user experience (UX) design approach to the problem, gathering persona-driven requirements and designing, prototyping, and testing a solution. Extensive geospatial wind resource data, energy infrastructure, shore and maritime air and vessel activity, protected lands, energy grid connections, and administrative processes are integrated in a web-based solution to screen and assess compatibility. This paper highlights Geographic Information Systems (GIS) used to provide decision support for site suitability analysis of offshore wind energy potential. With a focus on military use spaces, the project sought to gather publicly available activity spaces and areas of critical concern to military siting. We also integrated the newest available maritime vessel traffic activity from AIS data. A user-driven design is applied with GIS data that incorporates the diverse variability of energy, jurisdictional, and potential activity use space conflicts of an increasingly busy maritime environment. The approach taken in this project demonstrates that UX can support the range of developers, regulators, and maritime space users. The WindsiteVA hub spans onshore as well as offshore and nearshore (state waters and the Chesapeake Bay). Spatial analyses include several webmap capabilities, a library of basemaps, site exploration and coordinate conversion tools, reporting tools, and metadata and external data resources. Users are guided through pathways unique to personas: Developers, government agency personnel, or military personnel. As a â€œone-stop toolâ€ the webbased site is accessible publicly and utilizes Esri ArcGIS Hub technology. The site steps users through critical processes and data elements, such as informal queries, Notice of Proposed Construction for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), VA Department of Environmental Quality Permit by Rule (PBR), the US Department of Defense siting clearinghouse, and other procedures. Results suggest improved spatial decision-making and marine spatial planning can be achieved at minimal cost by combining UX design and geospatial hub technology. Wind resource development around seaports can be optimized and spatial conflicts reduced, costs lowered, and cumulative impacts identified. WindSiteVA captures complex processes and major concerns for wind energy availability and military concerns, yet it is not redundant with other policies or rules nor does it reflect sitescale reviews such as environmental impact assessments. Early results of WindSiteVA show that a screening-level approach can assist wind energy developers in coastal inshore and offshore waters, where relatively abundant wind energy resources exist, and reduce impacts to military and national defense and other maritime activities.","decision support systems,maritime vessel traffic activity,maritime commerce,wind energy availability,user experience design,vessel activity,web-based solution,government agency personnel,WindSiteVA captures complex process,Costs,maritime space users,Geospatial analysis,administrative process,wind energy siting,maritime activity spaces,UX design,extensive geospatial wind resource data,wind energy developers,webbased site,maritime air,military concerns,offshore waters,Hampton Roads,Esri ArcGIS Hub technology,local government,wind development impacts,persona-driven requirements,Virginia,clean energy development,wind energy resources,maritime activity space,military stakeholders,environmental impact assessments,Seaports,offshore wind energy potential,sustainable energy development,military personnel,Wind energy,Wind,busy maritime environment,external data resources,military siting,site suitability analysis,user-driven design,offshore installations,geographic information systems,wind power,publicly available activity spaces,military use spaces,national defense,US Department of Defense,Roads,Federal Aviation Administration,offshore wind,GIS data,geospatial hub,geographic information system,national security,energy grid connections,federal waters,wind resource development,WindsiteVA hub,energy infrastructure,maritime activities,site suitability,marine geodata portals,informal queries,AIS data,screening-level approach,FAA,"
"a simulation approach to estimate the value of information in maritime supply chains","2010","With the rapid increase in global trade and introduction of new security measures, maritime supply chain costs have increased and so has the need for business intelligence in improving maritime shipping operations. We develop a seaport operations model that simulates the decision making process associated with scheduling and processing of ships with the objective of evaluating the value of Geographical Information System (GIS) information. We consider two scenarios: (1) A traditional model where there is no GIS information on future ship arrivals; and (2) An information-rich model in which the arrival time of the next ship is known. We propose look-ahead based heuristics for the resulting optimization problems, determine the value of information (VOI), and tabulate how VOI varies as a function of the various operational parameters. Adding such operational intelligence to shipping operations improves the performance by as much as 60% (and by 15% on average) and reduces the costs without expanding the physical footprint of the seaport.","Biological system modeling,maritime shipping operation,Servers,competitive intelligence,supply chain management,geographical information system,Mathematical model,sea ports,geographic information systems,maritime supply chains,seaport operations model,value-of-information estimation,transportation,Marine vehicles,Geographic Information Systems,business intelligence,Analytical models,Supply chains,"

This paper describes resilience of ports to emergent conditions in three areas: Energy and fuels, controls and automation, and logistics transformation. First, the sustainability of energy and fuels have become a priority for ports due to growing concerns of carbon emissions. Liquified natural gas (LNG) is both a cost-effective and safe alternative fuel for reducing emissions of container ships. The feasibility and several strategies for adopting LNG bunkering at ports are described. Second, ports must leverage technological development to drive greater efficiency and operative resiliency. Recent developments in industrial automation and electrification are described. Lastly, the impact of corporate development to the region of the port is discussed. An analysis of enterprise capacity expansion includes both risks and benefits to increase competitiveness. This paper uses methodology of systems and data analysis, mathematical simulation, and risk cost-benefit optimization. The key results include identifying operational and security risks for container ports and providing strategies for risk mitigation and resilience. The recommendations are discussed in context of a USD $750 million ten-year strategic plan of a major container port on the Atlantic Coast of the United States.","sustainability,enterprise resilience,maritime container ports,sustainable development,United States,logistics systems,Atlantic Coast,electrification,Industries,Marine vehicles,cost-benefit analysis,logistics transformation,Resilience,industrial automation,data analysis,Liquefied natural gas,Containers,logistics,ships,safe alternative fuel,liquified natural gas,natural gas technology,optimisation,strategic planning,sea ports,container port,container ships,risk analysis,mathematical analysis,risk mitigation,risk cost-benefit optimization,Batteries,mathematical simulation,Systems engineering,"
"summer bloom of vulcanodinium rugosum in cienfuegos bay (cuba) associated to dermatitis in swimmers","2021","The marine dinoflagellate Vulcanodinium rugosum produces powerful paralyzing and cytotoxic compounds named pinnatoxins (PnTX) and portimines. Even though, no related human intoxication episodes following direct exposure in seawater or the ingestion of contaminated seafood have been documented so far. This study aimed at investigating a dinoflagellate bloom linked to acute dermatitis cases in two recreational beaches in Cienfuegos Bay, Cuba. We used epidemiological and clinical data from 60 dermatitis cases consisting of individuals in close contact with the bloom. Seawater physical-chemical properties were described, and the microorganism causing the bloom was identified by means of light and scanning electron microscopy. Morphological identification was confirmed genetically by sequencing the internal transcribed spacers ITS1 and ITS2, and the 5.8S rDNA region. Toxic compounds were identified from a bloom extract using liquid chromatography (LC) coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS), and their concentrations were estimated based on low-resolution tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Sixty people who had prolonged contact with the dinoflagellate bloom suffered acute dermal irritation. Most patients (79.2%) were children and had to be treated with antibiotics; some required >5-day hospitalization. Combined morphological and genetic characters indicated V. rugosum as the causative agent of the bloom. rDNA sequences of the V. rugosum genotype found in the bloom aligned with others from Asia, including material found in the ballast tank of a ship in Florida. The predominant toxins in the bloom were portimine, PnTX-F and PnTX-E, similar to strains originating from the Pacific Ocean. This bloom was associated with unusual weather conditions such as frequent and prolonged droughts. Our findings indicate a close link between the V. rugosum bloom and a dermatitis outbreak among swimmers in Cienfuegos Bay. Phylogenetic evidence suggests a recent introduction of V. rugosum from the Pacific Ocean into Caribbean waters, possibly via ballast water.","Microbial biogeography,Harmful algal bloom,Human health,Emergent toxin,Toxic dinoflagellate,Skin irritation,"
"pan-european distribution modelling of stream riparian zones based on multi-source earth observation data","2013","Freshwater ecosystems are among the most degraded and threatened globally. A need for systematic assessment of riverine habitats is thus well-documented. Riparian zones are especially important due to the large array of ecosystem and social services they can provide, while also recently gaining a major role in the new European biodiversity policy. In this context, the necessity to gather spatial information on extent, distribution and characteristics of the riparian zones is clear. This paper presents the development of a novel model to derive geographical distribution and basic characteristics of stream riparian zones in Europe, including both river-floodplain systems and the riparian networks of minor and ephemeral streams. A series of relevant descriptive attributes (water boundary, vegetation presence, land-cover, upland boundary and local geomorphology) is initially selected from the existing literature to describe the presence of riparian zones. Spatially explicit estimates of these attributes are obtained using available Earth Observation data and pan-European thematic datasets. Finally, the information layers are combined through an aggregation system that assigns a degree of belonging to the riparian zone class using two fuzzy membership functions to evaluate water influence and presence of natural vegetation, respectively. Riparian zones with no hydrological connection are also incorporated in by the model based on functional considerations. The distribution of stream riparian zones was derived and mapped for the whole of Europe at fine resolution. Modelled riparian zones extend for approximately 91,000km2, considering the entire range of low to high membership to the riparian class. A characterization of land-cover types was derived based on Corine Land Cover 2000 data, showing that European riparian zones are strongly dominated by forest habitats. Accuracy assessment was performed using independent ecological datasets and visual validation, indicating that producer accuracy is equal to 84.5±1.3% and user accuracy to 72.6±5.8% at 95% confidence level. The proposed model and output can represent valuable information for large-scale research activities of riparian environments and to support national and supra-national conservation programmes.","Geographical distribution,Riverine habitats,Transitional environments,Riparian zones,Fuzzy index,"
"heat, salt and volume transports by eddies in the vicinity of the luzon strait","2012","The heat, salt and volume transports by oceanic meso-scale eddies generated near the Luzon Strait and moving into the South China Sea (SCS) are estimated by combining satellite altimetry and sea surface temperature (SST) data with hydrographic data. By establishing a statistical relationship among steric height, SST and subsurface temperature, together with a multi-grid 3D-Var assimilation method, an eddy-resolving temperature/salinity dataset from 1993 to 2008 is reconstructed from the altimetry sea surface height (SSH) anomaly, remote sensing SST and historical temperature/salinity profiles in the SCS. Using two cases of eddies in the reconstructed temperature/salinity dataset, we show that a cyclonic eddy can carry negative heat anomaly with −6.7±2.5×1018J, which contributes to the heat balance of the region where it travels through, and freshwater of 0.0005±0.0002Sv into the SCS, and that an anti-cyclonic eddy can transport positive heat anomaly with 4.6±1.8×1018J, which might have affected the inteannual variation of heat in the upper layer of the SCS and bring freshwater of 0.0004±0.0001Sv into the SCS on top of the 26.5σθ isopycnal surface. The 16-year averaged heat, salt and volume transports by meso-scale eddies near the Luzon Strait are estimated as 0.00003±0.00001PW, 0.004±0.001×106kgs−1 and 0.3Sv into the SCS on top of the 25.0σθ isopycnal surface. During the 16-year period, these transports show significant interannual variations. Generally, the heat transport is positive during summers of El Niño, while it is negative or weakly positive during summers of La Niña.","Kuroshio intrusion,Luzon Strait,Meso-scale eddy,Data assimilation,Heat transport,"
"turia river delta and coastal barrier-lagoon of valencia (mediterranean coast of spain): geomorphological processes and global climate fluctuations since iberian-roman times","2019","Extensive drillings and 31 new C-14 datings were used to establish the geomorphological evolution of the Turia river delta and coastal barrier-lagoon system of Valencia (Spain) over the last three millennia. Integration of geomorphological, stratigraphic, malacological, sedimentological and geoarchaeological data enables us to relate river Turia avulsions and alluvial episodes to the development of coastal spits and barriers. Geomorphological changes in the study area may also be associated with global climate events, sea-level fluctuations or anthropogenic periods in the Turia catchment. Six phases may be differentiated: (1) a major early alluviation phase during the Iberian period, when the Turia river ran to the north of the coastal plain and sand spits closed the Valencia open lagoon environments, forming a permeable barrier (2800 BP to 2300 BP approximately); (2) an avulsion phase of the Turia river to the south at the end of the Roman period (4th century AD); (3) formation of a more advanced spit just behind the most recent barrier during the Late Antique Little Ice Age (LALIA, Visigothic period); (4) a flood period of high-magnitude with coarser sediments throughout the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA, 11th century AD), when La Punta meridional deltaic ridge developed, which can be related to beach ridge closing and marine isolation of the Valencia lagoon around the 12th century; (5) important river alluviation and growth of the recent coastal barrier favoured by Turia channel changes during the Middle Ages, in the early Little Ice Age (LIA); (6) rapid coastal progradation and decline in salinity in the Valencia lagoon between the Maunder sunspot minimum (MM) and the end of LIA.","River avulsions,Western Europe,Mediterranean,Coastal geomorphology,Holocene,Paleoclimatology,"

"seasonal oceanographic changes and their implications for the abundance of small pelagic fishes in the southern south china sea","2022","The seasonal variations in shelf circulation and their implications for the distribution of light fishing vessels positions (VBD) that capture small pelagic fishes in the southern South China Sea (SSCS) are investigated by using multi-datasets between 2008–2014. It is found that the SSCS shelf circulation is indicated by the strong seasonal reversal western boundary current (WBC) and prominent cyclonic circulation (eddy). The southeastward WBC brings homogeneous salty, colder, and high primary production of nanophytoplankton (PPN) water during winter-time from the northern and the cyclonic eddy region into the southern SSCS. In contrast, less salty, warmer, and less PPN are advected northwestward from Karimata into the northern region. These factors significantly influence the distribution of VBD and in turn the production of captured small pelagic fishes (CPUE), revealing two maxima (peaks) of both VBD and CPUE during the monsoon breaks (MB) with a time-lag of 2–3 month from the monsoon peaks. Relationship between oceanographic parameters and CPUE is examined statistically revealing that ocean current and PPN are significantly affect the CPUE. A relatively high PPN and strong current during the peaks of monsoon are correlated with lower CPUE. In contrast, during the MBs period CPUE maxima are associated with a relatively weak ocean current and consumed PPN that favor the abundance of small pelagic fishes.","Small pelagic fishes,Southern South China Sea,Light fishing vessels,Oceanographic parameters,"
"chapter four - the coral sea: physical environment, ecosystem status and biodiversity assets","2013","The Coral Sea, located at the southwestern rim of the Pacific Ocean, is the only tropical marginal sea where human impacts remain relatively minor. Patterns and processes identified within the region have global relevance as a baseline for understanding impacts in more disturbed tropical locations. Despite 70 years of documented research, the Coral Sea has been relatively neglected, with a slower rate of increase in publications over the past 20 years than total marine research globally. We review current knowledge of the Coral Sea to provide an overview of regional geology, oceanography, ecology and fisheries. Interactions between physical features and biological assemblages influence ecological processes and the direction and strength of connectivity among Coral Sea ecosystems. To inform management effectively, we will need to fill some major knowledge gaps, including geographic gaps in sampling and a lack of integration of research themes, which hinder the understanding of most ecosystem processes.","Food web,Pristine ecosystems,Connectivity,Tropical sea,Collaborative research,Ecosystem function,"
"gpu-accelerated compression and visualization of large-scale vessel trajectories in maritime iot industries","2020","The automatic identification system (AIS), an automatic vessel-tracking system, has been widely adopted to perform intelligent traffic management and collision avoidance services in maritime Internet-of-Things (IoT) industries. With the rapid development of maritime transportation, tremendous numbers of AIS-based vessel trajectory data have been collected, which make trajectory data compression imperative and challenging. This article mainly focuses on the compression and visualization of large-scale vessel trajectories and their graphics processing unit (GPU)-accelerated implementations. The visualization was implemented to investigate the influence of compression on vessel trajectory data quality. In particular, the Douglas-Peucker (DP) and kernel density estimation (KDE) algorithms, respectively, utilized for trajectory compression and visualization, were significantly accelerated through the massively parallel computation capabilities of the GPU architecture. Comprehensive experiments on trajectory compression and visualization have been conducted on large-scale AIS data of recording ship movements collected from three different water areas, i.e., the South Channel of Yangtze River Estuary, the Chengshan Jiao Promontory, and the Zhoushan Islands. Experimental results illustrated that: 1) the proposed GPU-based parallel implementation frameworks could significantly reduce the computational time for both trajectory compression and visualization; 2) the influence of compressed vessel trajectories on trajectory visualization could be negligible if the compression threshold was selected suitably; and 3) the Gaussian kernel was capable of generating more appropriate KDE-based visualization performance by comparing with other seven kernel functions.","trajectory compression,Douglas-Peucker algorithm,vessel trajectory data quality,trajectory visualization,Internet of Things,Industries,GPU-accelerated compression,large-scale vessel trajectories,data visualisation,Acceleration,compression threshold,vessel trajectory,parallel computing,ships,KDE-based visualization,marine safety,kernel density estimation,marine engineering,GPU-based parallel implementation frameworks,maritime transportation,graphics processing units,automatic identification system,collision avoidance services,maritime IoT industries,intelligent traffic management,compressed vessel trajectories,KDE algorithm,Artificial intelligence,AIS-based vessel trajectory data,data compression,Data visualization,graphics processing unit (GPU),graphics processing unit,Graphics processing units,Trajectory,maritime Internet-of-Things industries,large-scale AIS data,marine vehicles,automatic vessel-tracking system,"
"variability and change in the west antarctic peninsula marine system: research priorities and opportunities","2019","The west Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) region has undergone significant changes in temperature and seasonal ice dynamics since the mid-twentieth century, with strong impacts on the regional ecosystem, ocean chemistry and hydrographic properties. Changes to these long-term trends of warming and sea ice decline have been observed in the 21st century, but their consequences for ocean physics, chemistry and the ecology of the high-productivity shelf ecosystem are yet to be fully established. The WAP shelf is important for regional krill stocks and higher trophic levels, whilst the degree of variability and change in the physical environment and documented biological and biogeochemical responses make this a model system for how climate and sea ice changes might restructure high-latitude ecosystems. Although this region is arguably the best-measured and best-understood shelf region around Antarctica, significant gaps remain in spatial and temporal data capable of resolving the atmosphere-ice-ocean-ecosystem feedbacks that control the dynamics and evolution of this complex polar system. Here we summarise the current state of knowledge regarding the key mechanisms and interactions regulating the physical, biogeochemical and biological processes at work, the ways in which the shelf environment is changing, and the ecosystem response to the changes underway. We outline the overarching cross-disciplinary priorities for future research, as well as the most important discipline-specific objectives. Underpinning these priorities and objectives is the need to better define the causes, magnitude and timescales of variability and change at all levels of the system. A combination of traditional and innovative approaches will be critical to addressing these priorities and developing a co-ordinated observing system for the WAP shelf, which is required to detect and elucidate change into the future.","Primary production,Physical oceanography,Southern Ocean,Ecosystems,Sea ice,Nutrient and carbon cycling,Antarctica,Climate change,West Antarctic Peninsula,"

"efficient scheduling for video transmissions in maritime wireless communication networks","2015","This paper develops a framework for vessel surveillance video uploading via maritime wideband communication networks. A broadband wireless network utilizing a time-division-multiple-access (TDMA)-based media access control protocol is employed to establish a shore-side network infrastructure, and a packet store-carry-forward routing mechanism is adopted to achieve intermittent network connectivity in maritime communications. To provide high-quality videos to the administrative authority, a resource allocation problem is formulated to maximize the throughput priority-based video transmission problem, subject to the intermittent network connections and the time indexes such as the release time and deadline of each video packet. To reduce computational complexity, time-capacity mapping is applied to transform the original resource allocation problem into a two-machine nonpreemptive scheduling problem. Three offline scheduling algorithms are proposed, namely, a time-capacity-mapping-based two-phase (TMTP) algorithm for a single machine, a TMTP algorithm for two machines, and an interval graph-theory-based job relay selection (IGTJRS) algorithm. It is mathematically proved that the IGTJRS algorithm has an approximation ratio (i.e., the ratio of the throughput of an optimal schedule to that of the IGTJRS algorithm) of 2 and time complexity of O(n2).

In a first stage, models based on standardized structure-functional diagram are computed .[2] In a second stage, these diagrams as inputs are transformed through a model-driven engineering process, involving a library of ecological graphical representations and an interface background. Then, an ecological interface prototype can be generated. Previously, Anaxagore was used to generate conventional synoptic representation .[3] To validate its EID extended version, an experimental protocol has been established. The experiment was conducted at the National Maritime College, with 14 naval officers randomly divided into two groups according to the used interface. After a preliminary training of participants to the use of the interfaces, four scenarios were simulated during the experiment. For each scenario, the performance was evaluated by a success score and by measuring the time to detect and understand failure. With the EID interface generated by Anaxagore, faster detection time and better diagnosis accuracy were observed. Anaxagore seems to constitute a response for assisting the rapid prototyping of ecological interface.","automatic generation,ecological interface design,protyping,design,"
"maritime pattern extraction from ais data using a genetic algorithm","2016","The long term prediction of maritime vessels' destinations and arrival times is essential for making an effective logistics planning. As ships are influenced by various factors over a long period of time, the solution cannot be achieved by analyzing sailing patterns of each entity separately. Instead, an approach is required, that can extract maritime patterns for the area in question and represent it in a form suitable for querying all possible routes any vessel in that region can take. To tackle this problem we use a genetic algorithm (GA) to cluster vessel position data obtained from the publicly available Automatic Identification System (AIS). The resulting clusters are treated as route waypoints (WP), and by connecting them we get nodes and edges of a directed graph depicting maritime patterns. Since standard clustering algorithms have difficulties in handling data with varying density, and genetic algorithms are slow when handling large data volumes, in this paper we investigate how to enhance the genetic algorithm to allow fast and accurate waypoint identification. We also include a quad tree structure to preprocess data and reduce the input for the GA. When the route graph is created, we add post processing to remove inconsistencies caused by noise in the AIS data. Finally, we validate the results produced by the GA by comparing resulting patterns with known inland water routes for two Dutch provinces.","data mining,Clustering algorithms,Genetic algorithms,vessel position data cluster,marine navigation,directed graph,maritime pattern extraction,sailing pattern analysis,quadtrees,Biological cells,genetic algorithms,genetic algorithm,ships,Genetic Algorithms,automatic identification system,inland water routes,Dutch provinces,logistics planning,Automatic Identification System,quad tree structure,Data Mining,directed graphs,pattern clustering,Artificial intelligence,route querying,maritime vessel destination prediction,Pattern Recognition,Logistics,Synchromodal Logistics,long term prediction,route waypoints,Boats,logistics data processing,Data mining,AIS data,arrival time prediction,data handling,"

"real time observations of oceanographic and meteorological parameters for maritime transportation: origins and novel applications","2018","The first NOAA Physical Oceanographic Real-Time System (PORTSÂ®) was established in Tampa Bay, Florida, becoming operational in 1991 (https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/ports/index.shtml?port=tb). In April 2018, the Miami Physical Oceanographic Real-Time System was dedicated as the 30th such system in the US, followed closely by Port Everglades PORTSÂ® in June 2018 as the 31st. PORTSÂ® collects and disseminates real time meteorological and oceanographic data within major harbors around the US. PORTSÂ® data are an essential component for maintaining the safety and efficiency of maritime operations. Before the advent of PORTSÂ®, knowledge of environmental conditions relevant to ship operations in US harbors was generally limited to wind and precipitation sensors at the local airports and similar shipboard instrumentation. Water levels were inferred from standard tide tables even though surface winds were known to produce significant deviations from predicted values. This incomplete knowledge often led to navigational errors and to accidents. This paper will review the history of PORTSÂ® development, highlighting recent advances in sensor technologies and novel uses of PORTSÂ® data. On May 9, 1980, the 580 foot, 20,000 ton bulk carrier Summit Venture was approaching a critical turn toward the Sunshine Skyway Bridge in Tampa Bay, Florida and was overtaken by a violent, blinding thunderstorm. The ship veered off course and crashed into a main support pier of the bridge, collapsing the southbound span. Thirty-six people in vehicles fell into the water; 35 did not survive. The main ship channel into Tampa Bay port facilities was closed for 6 weeks, causing severe disruption to supplies of fuel and other commodities to the entire central Florida region. In the wake of the disaster, the local maritime community, led by the Tampa Bay Pilots Association and the Tampa Port Authority, petitioned the US Congress for funding to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to improve environmental monitoring capabilities in the bay. Nearly a decade later, the Tampa Bay Oceanography Project (TOP) began in 1990 as part of NOAA's Coastal Ocean Circulation Program (COCP). This included a 15 month study of currents, water levels, water temperatures, salinity, winds, and other meteorological/oceanographic parameters. By the end of the project, TOP had collected the largest number of circulation measurements in one estuary in the 100-year history of COCP. Successful completion of TOP was followed by permanent deployment of real-time telemetered sensors measuring winds, currents, and water levels at critical locations in the bay - the first official NOAA PORTSÂ® installation. Since 1991, local operations and maintenance of the system have been directed by the Greater Tampa Bay Marine Advisory Council-PORTS, Inc., a non-profit consortium of maritime interests, through cooperative agreements with the NOAA National Ocean Service Center for Operational Products and Services and the University of South Florida Center for Maritime and Port Studies. The success of TB-PORTS made it a prototype for a national program. Within three years of TB-PORTS becoming operational, San Francisco Bay and Houston/Galveston Bay implemented their own PORTSÂ® networks. Today PORTSÂ® operates 24 hours a day/7 days a week in 31 locations around the coasts and Great Lakes of the United States and is a component of the Integrated Ocean Observing System national backbone. The local operation and maintenance of PORTSÂ® facilities in each port remains funded by local maritime interests under the direction of NOAA/NOS/CO-OPS, who sets operational standards and manages the data quality control and dissemination through the Continuous Operational Real-Time Monitoring System (CORMS). PORTSÂ® data are provided to the public through the NOAA websitehttp://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/ports.html. A prototype project in Tampa Bay provides PORTSÂ® data to pilots aboard ships over the Automatic Identification System (AIS), now required on all commercial vessels over 20 m in length, in collaboration with the US Coast Guard R&D Center. The long time series observations of winds, currents, water levels, and other parameters in Tampa Bay from PORTSÂ® has fueled numerous scientific studies on the dynamics of the estuary. New sensor technologies have been incorporated into the PORTSÂ® data stream in recent years, including wave height, period, and direction, atmospheric visibility, and most recently, current measurements from sensors mounted on standard US Coast Guard aids to navigation buoys.","water levels,tides,Marine vehicles,transportation,https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/ports/index.shtml,Bridges,Sea measurements,environmental monitoring (geophysics),Maritime transportation,oceanographic equipment,ships,marine safety,real-time systems,Oceans,US Government agencies,NOAA websitehttp://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/ports.html,quality control,sea ports,Real-time systems,oceanographic regions,Tampa Bay port facilities,wind,precision navigation,bridges (structures),ocean observing,Greater Tampa Bay Marine Advisory Council-PORTS,Sensors,Port Everglades PORTS,TB-PORTS,oceanographic techniques,"
"obstacle avoidance and target search of an autonomous surface vehicle for 2016 maritime robotx challenge","2017","This paper describes algorithms for Autonomous Surface Vehicle(ASV) obstacle avoidance and target search task. This work is primarily designed for task mission of 2016 Maritime RobotX competition. In this task, ASV must avoid obstacle buoys, while it is searching for totem-shaped buoy. To deal with such problem, algorithms for both perception and motion planning stage was designed. In perception stage, 2D scanning LIDAR and monocular vision sensor are used to detect any floating objects on the water. To recognize target (totem buoy), HSV color space information was used. Detected object (both obstacle and totem buoy) information is tracked by using Kalman filter. In action planning stage, both deliberative and reflexive action [2] planning are designed. In deliberative action planning stage, based on the Kalman filter tracked obstacle information, a grid map can be generated. Using the grid map and A* search algorithm, desired path for searching totem can be calculated. In reflexive action planning stage, once ASV accidently enters hazardous region, where it has high probability of getting collide, it is designed to reflexively escape the region by making pure sway motion. An ASV experiment was performed to validate proposed method.","deliberative action planning stage,A* search algorithm,Kalman filter,Kalman filters,task mission,totem buoy recognition,remotely operated vehicles,perception stage,robot vision,2016 Maritime RobotX competition,2D scanning LIDAR,floating object detection,Planning,target search,monocular vision sensor,Laser radar,Image color analysis,image colour analysis,grid map,totem-shaped buoy,reflexive action planning stage,object tracking,autonomous surface vehicle,Collision avoidance,Target tracking,object detection,motion planning stage,Robots,optical radar,graph theory,obstacle buoy avoidance,search problems,ASV,probability,mobile robots,image sensors,marine vehicles,collision avoidance,HSV color space information,target recognition,object recognition,"
"a molecular dynamics approach for modeling the geographical distribution of ship collision risk","2020","Collision is one of the major accidents that put the safety of navigation at risk all the time. The effective monitoring on the geographical distribution of collision risk is conducive to reducing the chance of collision accidents. In this paper, a novel model intended for identifying the geographical distribution of collision risk in water area was proposed on the basis of radial distribution function in molecular dynamics. In this model, ship traffic and ships were converted into a molecular system. After being obtained using an analytical method, collision risk was generalized as distance to model the collision risk by radial distribution function. Finally, a space interpolation technique was applied to visualize the geographical distribution of collision risk. To validate the proposed model, the AIS data contained in Bohai Strait was used to conduct experiment. According to the experimental results, the map as obtained by the proposed model is capable to identify the geographical distribution of collision risk, and is advantageous over the traditional method in the instantaneity and accuracy of identification. Moreover, the proposed model can assist surveillance operators in the monitoring of collision risk and the improvement of work efficiency, thus enhancing the navigational safety in the water area.","Geographical distribution,AIS data,Radial distribution function,Collision risk,"

"assessing the range of radio maritime links in different waterbodies: effect of antenna height and band diversities","2021","In this paper, we analyze the weather information for 14 waterbodies from geographical areas with different meteorological characteristics. We estimate the sub-hourly instances of the evaporation duct height (EDH) throughout a period of 10 years. Then, considering the frequency range 1 to 6 GHz, based on the parabolic equation method, we analyze the quality for a presumed shore-to-ship link throughout 100 km range. We evaluate the maximum range that can be supported for different reliability requirements and we focus specifically on analyzing the gain that can be obtained when antenna height and/or band diversity are used. It was found that for high reliability requirements, the antenna height at the shore is the main factor on deciding the maximum communication range that can be maintained. On the other hand, for applications that tolerate delay and work seasonally on an opportunistic basis, the evaporation duct statistics is the main factor deciding the likelihood of increasing the link range and establishing over-the-horizon communications.","telecommunication network reliability,Antennas,evaporation duct height distributions,reliability requirements,Ducts,Delays,Conferences,microwave antennas,EDH,Reliability,Vehicular and wireless technologies,time 10.0 year,size 100.0 km,antenna height diversity,shore-to-ship communications,band diversities,Meteorology,band diversity,statistical analysis,maximum communication range,parabolic equation method,link range,frequency 1.0 GHz to 6.0 GHz,meteorological characteristics,evaporation duct height,evaporation duct statistics,weather information,radio maritime links,over-the-horizon communications,shore-to-ship link,parabolic equations,marine communication,geographical areas,water bodies,antenna height,"
"optimising maritime processes via artificial intelligence: the vesselai concept and use cases","2022","The beginning of this decade finds artificial intelligence, high performance computing (HPC), and big data analytics in the forefront of digital transformation that is projected to heavily impact various industries and domains. Specifically, the maritime industry, which is already a relatively advanced area concerned to others could stand to gain great benefits from the combination and application of innovative technologies in its practices. This fact, combined with the amount of data generated from naval vessels and sensors points to the direction of AI and big data, two technologies that have the ability to absorb large amounts of data, process them and provide automated and optimised solutions for all maritime stakeholders. Integrating these technologies and tools in a unified system poses various challenges. Under this context, the current publication presents the concept and pilot use cases of VesselAI, an EU-funded project that aims to develop, validate and demonstrate a novel holistic framework based on a combination of the state-of-the-art HPC, Big Data and AI technologies, capable of performing extreme-scale and distributed analytics for fuelling the next-generation digital twins in maritime applications and beyond, including vessel motion and behaviour modelling, analysis and prediction, ship energy system design and optimisation, unmanned vessels, route optimisation and fleet intelligence.

"how maritime education and training (met) instructors address assessment protocol","2020","With the advent of more technologies being utilized on a modern Ships Navigational Bridge it is important to address all human elements that play a role in the safety of the vessel. Of these elements, the training of personal in the use of the ships modern equipment is imperative. To address this, the maritime industry both on the international and national levels implements a series of assessments to validate a potential officer's knowledge base. This study looks to identify the Maritime Bridge Simulators instructor's interpretation of the assessments done on a Navigation simulator. An Auto Ethnographic approach is utilized to highlight current and previous interactions with the former Mariners, who are now educators. These Maritime Education and Training (MET) instructors, who utilize a modern Full Mission Bridge Simulator, as they assess a navigational bridge team will be examined. The preliminary understanding and projected findings is that both the performance based assessment and the interactive assessments done on these simulators, inform teaching and enhance learning experiences. However, the assessments themselves which are mandated, are vague and unsuccessful in properly assessing a future Maritime Officer. As Mariners have all experienced some subject matter experts who may have all of the qualifications needed to teach, yet are incapable of doing so. On the other hand, some may not have mastery of the subject but are able to pass on the knowledge needed for one to succeed sufficiently. In a worst-case scenario, there are those who â€œcan neither do nor teach.â€ How can we prevent these instances from offering? Is there something within mandated regulations that can be used to avoid this from occurring? Could there be a cultural or societal aspect that we can use as a preventative means? These questions are difficult to answer. There is a need to be judged on many levels, as well as discussed and debated. Instructors in the Maritime industry are no different than the Instructors in other fields. They have all been exposed to the subject that they are required to teach, how they prepare and interpret the lessons needed is not always the same as one would think. Simulation as an educational tool has been used across a broad spectrum of subjects and industries. How these simulations are integrated within the classroom differs depending on the simulator. One of the main objectives of simulation is Project-Based learning. Simulations that encompass the Project-Based Learning design can be defined as complex tasks based on difficult questions. These situations provoke the student to design, implement problem-solving, and decision making processes. The fact-finding activities embedded in the simulation can provide students with situations where they need to work independently over significant periods. At the end of the simulation, there is a concluding event that emulates realistic products or situations [1]. In addition to the â€œProjectâ€ associated with this theory, there are other defining factors; these factors include authentic content, authentic assessment, teacher facilitation, and clear educational goals[2]. All of these play a significant role within the realm of Maritime Simulation. For a successful Simulation of a Ships Navigational bridge to occur, the preliminary understanding and projected findings is that the performance-based assessment and the interactive assessments done on these simulators, inform teaching and enhance learning experiences. In order to accomplish this, many challenges are facing the educators that operate these simulated exercises. The first challenge is the Professional Development of the educators. Unlike most professional educators, the requirements to teach within this field are limited. The students that these instructors teach also differ in that they are an older student. This method is called Andragogy. The way the instructor approaches this must be different from the Petrological approach of young students. The final challenge addressed here is the instructor's interpretation of both international and national regulations. By utilizing Authentic Assessment, educators need to cultivate a better understanding of the concept or subject taught and focus less on the improved learning outcomes associated with them [3].","international regulations,interactive assessments,Project-Based Learning,human elements,project-based learning design,Regulation,Andragogy,assessment protocol,MET Instructors,Industries,Marine vehicles,modern ships navigational bridge,potential officer,maritime simulation,Bridges,Instructor Training,educational courses,preliminary understanding,Mariners,Maritime Simulation,ships,Authentic Assessment,navigational bridge team,marine engineering,clear educational goals,international levels,educational tool,Auto Ethnographic approach,computer based training,decision making,Professional Development,modern Full Mission Bridge Simulator,ships modern equipment,simulated exercises,teaching,Maritime Education and Training,performance-based assessment,MET,subject matter experts,Performance-based Assessment,future maritime officer,professional educators,maritime industry,Navigation,Task analysis,performance based assessment,Tools,authentic assessment,learning experiences,maritime education and training instructors,navigation simulator,maritime bridge simulators instructor,"
"lanepost: lane-based optimal routing protocol for delay-tolerant maritime networks","2017","Ship-to-ship, ship-to-shore radio links empowered by WiFi, WiMAX etc have been recently exploited to build maritime multi-hop mesh networks to provide internet services to on-ship users. However, because of the mobility of the vessels/ships and the large inter-ship distances, nodes in the maritime network are frequently disconnected, forcing data communication in the maritime mesh networks to be opportunistic and delay-tolerant. In this paper, we present LanePost, an optimization approach for maritime delay-tolerant routing protocol. We exploit the shipping lane information to predict the rendezvous opportunities of the ships to optimize the route selection in delay-tolerant routing. In particular, we show that when the shipping lane information is available, an opportunistic routing graph (ORG) for each ship can be constructed to predict its multi-hop data routing opportunities to the other ships or to the shore. Based on the ORG, we develop an optimal route protocol (i.e., LanePost) for each ship to minimize its delay of multi-hop packet delivery via dynamic programming. We discussed the ways of collecting shipping lane information by centralized method or distributed method. The proposed LanePost protocol was evaluated by ONE, an open-source delay-tolerant network simulator, which shows its dramatic performance improvement in terms of delay reduction compared to the state-of-the-art opportunistic routing protocols.","radio links,maritime,wireless mesh networks,Marine vehicles,delay-tolerant,Delays,Mesh networks,routing protocols,ORG,delay minimization,waterway networks,trafficlane,Routing protocols,opportunistic routing graph,Internet service,data communication,ships,intership distance,route selection,centralized method,maritime multihop mesh network,LanePost protocol,shipping lane information,multihop packet delivery delay,delay-tolerant maritime network,dynamic programming,Spread spectrum communication,graph theory,ship-to-shore radio link,opportunistic routing,distributed method,on-ship user,open-source delay-tolerant network simulator,delay reduction,optimization approach,lane-based optimal routing protocol,Routing,delay tolerant networks,ship-to-ship radio link,marine communication,vessel-ship mobility,multihopnetworks,"

"regional scale assessment of submarine groundwater discharge in ireland combining medium resolution satellite imagery and geochemical tracing techniques","2012","This paper sets the foundation for the use of freely available Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) thermal infrared (TIR) imagery in a regional scale assessment of submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) to coastal waters. A comprehensive, tiered, three-step approach is proposed as the most effective and affordable means to determine the spatial extent and scale of SGD from coastal aquifers to the coastal margin. As the preliminary step, Sea Surface Temperature (SST) values derived from Landsat ETM+ TIR are used to successfully detect plumes of colder water eventually associated with SGD in close proximity to the shoreline. Subsequently, potential sites of SGD are linked to geological features on land acting as possible sources, by combining within a Geographical Information System (GIS), mapped temperature anomalies with ancillary on-shore spatial datasets describing bedrock geology including aquifer fault lines. Finally, nearshore surveys mapping the activity of 222Rn (radon) and salinity are carried out to verify the presence of SGD and provide a qualitative assessment of fresh groundwater inputs to the coastal zone. Practical application of the complete approach in the context of coastal zone management is illustrated through a case-study of the Republic of Ireland. As part of this study, over 30 previously unidentified links between aquifers on land and the sea are shown along the Irish coast, hence illustrating the tight coupling between coastal waters and groundwater inputs at an unprecedented spatial scale. The study demonstrates the potential of the combined applications of remote sensing methods and geochemical tracing techniques for a cost-effective regional-scale assessment of groundwater discharge to coastal waters.","Radon,Landsat ETM+,Submarine groundwater discharge,Salinity,Thermal remote sensing,Geochemical tracing,"

"ferrybox and meris – assessment of coastal and shelf sea ecosystems by combining in situ and remotely sensed data","2008","An automatic measuring system called “FerryBox” was installed in the North Sea on a ferry travelling between Germany (Cuxhaven) and Great Britain (Harwich), enabling online oceanographic and biological measurements such as salinity, temperature, fluorescence, turbidity, oxygen, pH, and nutrient concentrations. Observations made along the ferry transect reveal characteristic phenomena such as high salinity inflow through the Channel into the Southern Bight, algal bloom dynamics and related oxygen and pH changes. Combination of these online observations with remote sensing enhances the spatial resolution of the transect related measurements. Several examples of the synergy between these two measuring strategies are shown, both for large-scale algal blooms in the North Sea as well as for local intense but short-term blooms in the German Bight. Coherence of the data sets can be gained and improved by using water transport models in order to obtain synoptic overviews of the remotely sensed and FerryBox related parameters. Limitations of the currently used algorithms for deriving chlorophyll-a from remote sensing images for coastal and shelf seas (Case-2 water) are discussed, as well as depth related processes which cannot be properly resolved on the basis of water intake at a fixed point. However, in unstratified coastal waters under normal conditions FerryBox data represent average conditions. The importance of future applications of this combination of methods for monitoring of coastal waters is emphasized.","monitoring,ships-of-opportunity,colour remote sensing,primary production,chlorophyll-,"
"coral skeletal geochemistry as a monitor of inshore water quality","2016","Coral reefs maintain extraordinary biodiversity and provide protection from tsunamis and storm surge, but inshore coral reef health is degrading in many regions due to deteriorating water quality. Deconvolving natural and anthropogenic changes to water quality is hampered by the lack of long term, dated water quality data but such records are required for forward modelling of reef health to aid their management. Reef corals provide an excellent archive of high resolution geochemical (trace element) proxies that can span hundreds of years and potentially provide records used through the Holocene. Hence, geochemical proxies in corals hold great promise for understanding changes in ancient water quality that can inform broader oceanographic and climatic changes in a given region. This article reviews and highlights the use of coral-based trace metal archives, including metal transported from rivers to the ocean, incorporation of trace metals into coral skeletons and the current ‘state of the art’ in utilizing coral trace metal proxies as tools for monitoring various types of local and regional source-specific pollution (river discharge, land use changes, dredging and dumping, mining, oil spills, antifouling paints, atmospheric sources, sewage). The three most commonly used coral trace element proxies (i.e., Ba/Ca, Mn/Ca, and Y/Ca) are closely associated with river runoff in the Great Barrier Reef, but considerable uncertainty remains regarding their complex biogeochemical cycling and controlling mechanisms. However, coral-based water quality reconstructions have suffered from a lack of understanding of so-called vital effects and early marine diagenesis. The main challenge is to identify and eliminate the influence of extraneous local factors in order to allow accurate water quality reconstructions and to develop alternate proxies to monitor water pollution. Rare earth elements have great potential as they are self-referencing and reflect basic terrestrial input.","Scleractinian corals,Trace element uptake,Coral calcification,Coral geochemical proxies,Water quality,"

"ecological bridges and barriers in pelagic ecosystems","2017","Many highly mobile species are known to use persistent pathways or corridors to move between habitat patches in which conditions are favorable for particular activities, such as breeding or foraging. In the marine realm, environmental variability can lead to the development of temporary periods of anomalous oceanographic conditions that can connect individuals to areas of habitat outside a population's usual range, or alternatively, restrict individuals from areas usually within their range, thus acting as ecological bridges or ecological barriers. These temporary features can result in novel or irregular trophic interactions and changes in population spatial dynamics, and, therefore, may have significant implications for management of marine ecosystems. Here, we provide evidence of ecological bridges and barriers in different ocean regions, drawing upon five case studies in which particular oceanographic conditions have facilitated or restricted the movements of individuals from highly migratory species. We discuss the potential population-level significance of ecological bridges and barriers, with respect to the life history characteristics of different species, and inter- and intra-population variability in habitat use. Finally, we summarize the persistence of bridge dynamics with time, our ability to monitor bridges and barriers in a changing climate, and implications for forecasting future climate-mediated ecosystem change.","Population connectivity,Tuna,Oceanographic features,Species distribution,Migration corridors,Billfish,Brazilian episode,Marine mammal,"
"carbon and nitrogen elemental and isotopic ratios of filter-feeding bivalves along the french coasts: an assessment of specific, geographic, seasonal and multi-decadal variations","2018","Primary consumers play a key role in coastal ecosystems by transferring organic matter from primary producers to predators. Among them, suspension-feeders, like bivalve molluscs are widely used in trophic web studies. The main goal of this study was to investigate variations of C and N elemental and isotopic ratios in common bivalves (M. edulis, M. galloprovincialis, and C. gigas) at large spatial (i.e. among three coastal regions) and different temporal (i.e. from seasonal to multi-decadal) scales in France, in order to identify potential general or specific patterns and speculate on their drivers. The observed spatial variability was related to the trophic status of the coastal regions (oligotrophic Mediterranean Sea versus meso- to eutrophic English Channel and Atlantic ocean), but not to ecosystem typology (estuaries, versus lagoons versus bays versus littoral systems). Furthermore, it highlighted local specificities in terms of the origin of the POM assimilated by bivalves (e.g., mainly continental POM vs. marine phytoplankton vs. microphytobenthic algae). Likewise, seasonal variability was related both to the reproduction cycle for C/N ratios of Mytilus spp. and to changes in trophic resources for δ13C of species located close to river mouth. Multi-decadal evolution exhibited shifts and trends for part of the 30-year series with decreases in δ13C and δ15N. Specifically, shifts appeared in the early 2000's, likely linking bivalve isotopic ratios to a cascade of processes affected by local drivers.","Carbon,Coastal ecosystems,Elemental and isotope ratios,France,Nitrogen,Bivalves,"
"the structure and dynamics of multilayer networks","2014","In the past years, network theory has successfully characterized the interaction among the constituents of a variety of complex systems, ranging from biological to technological, and social systems. However, up until recently, attention was almost exclusively given to networks in which all components were treated on equivalent footing, while neglecting all the extra information about the temporal- or context-related properties of the interactions under study. Only in the last years, taking advantage of the enhanced resolution in real data sets, network scientists have directed their interest to the multiplex character of real-world systems, and explicitly considered the time-varying and multilayer nature of networks. We offer here a comprehensive review on both structural and dynamical organization of graphs made of diverse relationships (layers) between its constituents, and cover several relevant issues, from a full redefinition of the basic structural measures, to understanding how the multilayer nature of the network affects processes and dynamics.",""

"obligations and challenges for national maritime administrations concerning the latest requirement for ships to carry ecdis equipment","2007","Since the earliest sailing exploits, the safety of navigation has been conditioned by the availability and reliability of adequate shipboard navigation aids. Surely, the success of such exploits also depended on officers' competence for using these aids in an adequate manner. Through the centuries, there were no significant changes in the technical performance of basic navigation aids or in their usage, and therefore there was no need for additional education of navigation officers. However, a rapid technological development in many areas of human activities has brought about significant changes in the last several decades. Maritime transport of goods is an important part of the total transport of goods in the world, the result of which is a rapid development and the use of state-of-the-art technologies in the design and building of ships of different sizes and for different purposes. Such dynamics of the use of new technologies in the maritime transport has not followed the dynamics of the development of modern navigation systems. For that reason, even today a great number of ships are fitted with navigation equipment whose safety level is lower than that of the modern navigation systems used in other kinds of transport.

"knowledge discovery using genetic algorithm for maritime situational awareness","2014","Due to the large volume of data related to vessels, to manually pore through and to analyze the information in a bid to identify potential maritime threat is tedious, if at all possible. This study aims to enhance maritime situational awareness through the use of computational intelligence techniques in detecting anomalies. A knowledge discovery system based on genetic algorithm termed as GeMASS was proposed and investigated in this research. In the development of GeMASS, a machine learning approach was applied to discover knowledge that is applicable in characterizing maritime security threats. Such knowledge is often implicit in datasets and difficult to discover by human analysts. As the knowledge relevant to maritime security may vary from time to time, GeMASS was specified to learn from streaming data and to generate up-to-date knowledge in a dynamic fashion. Based on the knowledge discovered, the system functions to screen vessels for anomalies in real-time. Traditionally in maritime security studies, datasets that are applied as knowledge sources are related to vessels’ geographical and movement information. This study investigated a novel leverage of multiple data sources, including Automatic Identification System, classification societies, and port management and security systems for the enhancement of maritime security. A prototype of GeMASS was developed and employed as a vehicle to study and demonstrate the functions of the proposed methodology.","Defense,Maritime security,Genetic algorithm,Knowledge discovery,Decision support,Machine learning,"

"reconstructing the landscape evolution and the human occupation of the lower sagone river (western corsica, france) from the bronze age to the medieval period","2017","This paper aims to reconstruct the landscape evolution together with the vegetation history of the lower Sagone Valley, Western Corsica, which was occupied from the Bronze Age to the Medieval Period. Adopting a geoarchaeological approach, the combination of sedimentological, palynological, and geophysical data enables the reconstruction of various stages in the landscape evolution of the Lower Sagone River over the last 4000years, together with the history of human occupation. The methods consist of a palaeoenvironmental study of 9 boreholes drilled in the modern deltaic plain, at a maximum distance of 500m from the present-day shoreline. The laboratory analyses included mollusk identification and measurements of the grain-size distribution (by wet sieving). A series of 21 radiocarbon dates on charcoal, plant remains, wood fragments, and marine mollusk samples formed the basis for a chronostratigraphy. In order to reconstruct the vegetation history of the catchment, with particular attention to anthropogenic activity, pollen analysis was conducted on clay samples from the deepest borehole, and they revealed a semi-open forest during the Bronze Age and Late Iron Age with extensive pastoral activity and limited cereal cultivation. Electric Resistivity Tomography (ERT) of 3 profiles across the alluvial plain was conducted in order to reveal the geometry of the sedimentary bodies. The salient features are the presence of a freshwater lake during the Mid- to Late Bronze Age (from 1500 to 1100cal. BCE), its transformation into an open marine bay from ca. 1100 until 500cal. BCE, and the formation of a confined lagoon from 500cal. BCE to 200cal. CE.",""
"cultural dynamics and ceramic resource use at late bronze age/early iron age troy, northwestern turkey","2013","Changes in resource use over time can provide insight into technological choice and the extent of long-term stability in cultural practices. In this paper we re-evaluate the evidence for a marked demographic shift at the inception of the Early Iron Age at Troy by applying a robust macroscale analysis of changing ceramic resource use over the Late Bronze and Iron Age. We use a combination of new and legacy analytical datasets (NAA and XRF), from excavated ceramics, to evaluate the potential compositional range of local resources (based on comparisons with sediments from within a 10 km site radius). Results show a clear distinction between sediment-defined local and non-local ceramic compositional groups. Two discrete local ceramic resources have been previously identified and we confirm a third local resource for a major class of EIA handmade wares and cooking pots. This third source appears to derive from a residual resource on the Troy peninsula (rather than adjacent alluvial valleys). The presence of a group of large and heavy pithoi among the non-local groups raises questions about their regional or maritime origin.","Local production,Bottom-up sampling,Macro-analysis,Multivariate analysis,Neutron Activation Analysis,Statistical power relationships,Legacy datasets,"

"palaeomagnetism and magnetic anisotropy of carboniferous red beds from the maritime provinces of canada: evidence for shallow palaeomagnetic inclinations and implications for north american apparent polar wander","2010","A palaeomagnetic and magnetic anisotropy study was conducted on the lower-middle Carboniferous Maringouin and Shepody red bed formations of the Maritime Provinces of Canada to detect and correct inclination shallowing. Because of the shallow inclinations commonly observed in red beds and the strong dependence of North America's Palaeo-Mesozoic apparent polar wander (APW) on red beds, inclination shallowing may substantially affect large portions of North America's APW path. Hematite is the primary magnetic mineral carrier in these red beds, accompanied by secondary magnetite, maghemite, goethite and pigmentary hematite. Thermal and chemical demagnetization of the Shepody Fm. successfully isolated characteristic remanence directions of D= 177Â°, I= 20.4Â°, Î±95= 6.5Â°, N= 19 and D= 177.8Â°I= 17.7Â°, Î±95= 6.9Â°, N= 16, respectively. Thermal demagnetization of the Maringouin Fm. isolated a characteristic remanence direction of D= 178.7Â°, I= 24.9Â°, Î±95= 14.5Â°, N= 9.High field anisotropy of isothermal remanence followed by alternating field and thermal cleaning on leached samples was used to isolate the fabric of hematite. Individual particle anisotropy was measured directly from magnetic separates using a new technique. Hematite's magnetic fabric and particle anisotropy were used to apply an inclination correction. Our inclination corrections indicate up to 10Â° of inclination shallowing, corresponding to corrected palaeopole positions of 27.2Â°N, 118.3Â°E, A95= 6.2Â° and 27.4Â°N, 117.2Â°E, A95= 13.1Â° for the Shepody and Maringouin formations, respectively. This correction corresponds to a âˆ¼ 6Â° increase in colatitude for Carboniferous North America, which translates into approximately a 650 km change in North America's palaeogeographic position. The proposed position of North America supports a Pangea B-type reconstruction.","Palaeomagnetism applied to Tectonics,Magnetic mineralogy and petrology,Palaeomagnetism applied to geologic processes,Magnetic fabrics and anisotropy,Rock and mineral magnetism,"
"maritime linked data for situational awareness heterogeneous sensor networks","2021","Maritime heterogeneous sensor networks (HSN), which are widely used in support of marine monitoring, maritime security and safety applications, combine diversified sensing systems and platforms observing the state of environmental features of interest or the status of anthropogenic objects to achieve awareness on the situation. To model the information characteristics of HSN observations for maritime situational awareness (MSA), we developed the MSA-HSN ontology, an integrated semantic model for maritime linked data, specifically observations suiting the requirements of maritime information fusion systems. MSA-HSN integrates established ontologies and models for sensors, observations, measurements, quantities, and occurrents, tailored to MSA applications and requirements. To support the interoperability with existing maritime data models, MSA-HSN is aligned with the relevant aspects of the EUCISE/e-CISE (Common Information Sharing Environment) data models. As a validation use case, in this paper the MSA-HSN ontology is applied to model the information elements of the maritime surveillance system developed within the Interactive Extreme-Scale Analytics and Forecasting (INFORE) project, where different situational views offered by a variegate suite of sensors and platforms are fused using big data analytics to achieve maritime situational awareness for maritime security.

"intelligent decision making solutions for maritime search and rescue missions","2022","Safety accidents are always the key issue for enterprises to prevent and avoid, and offshore accidents are particularly hard to resolve due to their special geographical characteristics. Marine accidents not only bring a large number of casualties, but also generate large property losses. In addition, the marine environment will also be affected to a certain extent. In the event of a maritime accident, the efficiency of maritime search and rescue work is seriously affected by the relatively complex rescue environment due to the large number of factors affecting maritime disasters, which makes it difficult to develop maritime search and rescue measures in a short period of time. The result is infected with the intuitive impact brought by human factors on maritime search and rescue work. In order to avoid the impact of human factors, the maritime intelligent auxiliary decision-making system should be actively built to assist the commander to judge the maritime accident information, and do a good job of scientific and reasonable search and rescue guidance work. Especially in the situation of rapid development of information technology, the construction of artificial intelligence-based auxiliary system for maritime search and rescue to provide strong technical support, are to ensure the safe development of the maritime industry, should increase the research on intelligent auxiliary decision-making system, so that it becomes a cornerstone to help commanders quickly improve the maritime search and rescue program, leading them to work smoothly.",""
"maritime traffic route detection framework based on statistical density analysis from ais data using a clustering algorithm","2022","Maritime traffic routes by ships navigation vary according to country and geographic characteristics, and they differ according to the characteristics of the ships. In ocean areas adjacent to coasts, regulated routes are present, e.g., traffic separation scheme for ships entering and leaving; however, most ocean areas do not have such routes. Maritime traffic route research has been conducted based on computer engineering to create routes; however, ship characteristics were not considered. Thus, this article proposes a framework to generate maritime traffic routes using statistical density analysis. Here, automatic identification system (AIS) data are used to derive quantitative traffic routes. Preprocessing is applied to the AIS data, and a similar ship trajectory pattern is decomposed into a matrix based on the Hausdorffâ€“distance algorithm and then stored in a database. A similar pattern makes the AIS trajectory simple using the Douglasâ€“Peucker algorithm. In addition, density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) is performed to identify the waypoints of vessels then create routes by connecting waypoints. The width of maritime routes created based on a similar ship trajectory is subjected to kernel density estimation analysis (KDE). Then, waypoints evaluation of the main route is performed from the results of KDE 75% and 90% considering the statistical in the total maritime traffic, and the results applied to the targeted ocean area are compared. Finally, the result of KDE 90% of maritime traffic with framework analyzed the safety route, which can be a basis for developing routes for maritime autonomous surface ships.","traffic separation scheme,ocean areas,marine accidents,Clustering algorithms,Safety,targeted ocean area,Douglas-Peucker algorithm,automatic identification system data,vehicle routing,total maritime traffic,Marine vehicles,maritime autonomous surface ships,quantitative traffic routes,geographic characteristics,DBSCAN,statistical analysis,ships,marine safety,kernel density estimation,AIS trajectory simple,maritime traffic route detection framework,kernel density estimation analysis,Oceans,Hausdorff-distance algorithm,ship trajectory pattern,framework,pattern clustering,Artificial intelligence,statistical density analysis,marine engineering computing,Trajectory,ship characteristics,maritime traffic route research,Navigation,safety route,density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise,clustering algorithm,AIS data,maritime traffic route,"
"geochemistry and petrology of witwatersrand and dwyka diamictites from south africa: search for an extraterrestrial component","2001","Diamictites are poorly sorted sediments characteristically carrying coarse-grained clasts in a fine-grained matrix. They have generally been considered of glaciogenic or glaciomarine origin. Recently, however, it has been suggested that some massive tillite/diamictite layers could represent impact breccias. An earlier petrographic study of rock and mineral clasts from Dwyka Group diamictites revealed no evidence for shock metamorphism, such as planar deformation features. Detailed geochemical studies of diamictite samples from the Archean Witwatersrand Supergroup and the Dwyka Group of the Mesozoic Karoo Supergroup from South Africa are reported. We studied the contents of the siderophile elements in these breccias, as elevated abundances of such elements, especially iridium, could be indicative for an impact origin. By use of γ-γ coincidence spectrometry and other trace element analysis, geochemical tracers of extraterrestrial components were sought. However, no enrichments of indicator elements for extraterrestrial components, compared with ordinary continental crust, were found. Thus, neither geochemical nor petrographic evidence supports an impact origin of the diamictites from the Dwyka Group and the Witwatersrand Supergroup in South Africa.",""
"toward the automated construction of probabilistic knowledge graphs for the maritime domain","2021","International maritime crime is becoming increasingly sophisticated, often associated with wider criminal networks. Detecting maritime threats by means of fusing data purely related to physical movement (i.e., those generated by physical sensors, or hard data) is not sufficient. This has led to research and development efforts aimed at combining hard data with other types of data (especially human-generated or soft data). Existing work often assumes that input soft data is available in a structured format, or is focused on extracting certain relevant entities or concepts to accompany or annotate hard data. Much less attention has been given to extracting the rich knowledge about the situations of interest implicitly embedded in the large amount of soft data existing in unstructured formats (such as intelligence reports and news articles). In order to exploit the potentially useful and rich information from such sources, it is necessary to extract not only the relevant entities and concepts, but also their semantic relations, together with the uncertainty associated with the extracted knowledge (i.e., in the form of probabilistic knowledge graphs). This will increase the accuracy of, and confidence in, the extracted knowledge and facilitate subsequent reasoning and learning. To this end, we propose Maritime DeepDive, an initial prototype for the automated construction of probabilistic knowledge graphs from natural language data for the maritime domain. In this paper, we report on the current implementation of Maritime DeepDive, together with preliminary results on extracting probabilistic events from maritime piracy incidents.

"variability of lightning activity in south/southeast asia during 1997–98 and 2002–03 el nino/la nina events","2012","Impacts of the 1997–98 and 2002–03 ENSOs on total number of flashes and number of flash days from the LIS (Lightning Imaging Sensor) on board the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission satellite and on the average flash rate from the combined OTD (Optical Transient Detector) / LIS data are studied in South/Southeast Asia (8° –30°N, 60°–120°E) for the period 1998–2005. Also examined is the difference between the geographical distributions of these parameters in the El Nino period in 1998 and in the corresponding normal period in 1999. During the 1997–98 ENSO event, the number of flashes and average flash rate increase by 12% and 36%, respectively, during the El Nino period and during the La Nina period decrease by 22% and 5%, respectively, as compared to the corresponding normal periods. Similarly, during the 2002–2003 ENSO event, the number of flashes and average flash rate increase by 28% and 5% during the El Nino period in 2002 as compared to the corresponding normal period. The contrast in lightning activity between the El Nino and La Nina periods is more pronounced in Southeast Asia than in South Asia because of the southeastward shift in the convection activity during the ENSO events. In both regions, however, monthly variations of both total number of flashes and average flash rate are almost parallel to that of surface temperature. Although, the inverse relationship between the Indian Summer Monsoon Rainfall (ISMR) and El Nino broke down in 1997–98, the relationship between the El Nino and lightning maintains its normal increasing trend, indicating that the lightning activity is more sensitive to the convective activity than to rainfall on seasonal time scale. The total number of flashes and aerosol loading increase in the break‐period regime as compared to the monsoonal regime. The number of flash days in both ENSO events is higher in the EL Nino phase and lower in the La Nina phase as compared to their normal values in the subsequent years. Enhancement of lightning activity is mostly concentrated over land areas. Our results show that although diurnal variations in lightning activity can be related to the variations in surface temperature, convective adjustment induced by the corresponding ENSO phase needs to be considered for explaining the lightning activity variations on these longer time scales.","ENSO impact,South/Southeast Asia,El Nino impact,Lightning activity,"

One of the main challenges in the development of such transport systems is to ensure functionality and safety. Due to the introduction of non-deterministic approaches, such as the use of self-learning artificial intelligence, classical methods for safety verification are no longer suitable. Systematic scenario-based validation and verification approaches have already been proposed to address this problem. Often these are based on the use of simulations. Currently, a lot of effort is put into the implementation of such simulation systems and many (partial) solutions have already been proposed. Nevertheless, a common line of thought seems to be missing. This study, therefore, identifies requirements for such systems, systematically searches for published scientific literature to identify existing systems, reviews the systems found regarding the posed requirements, and in that way identifies open research gaps.

"anomaly detection in maritime data based on geometrical analysis of trajectories","2015","Anomaly detection is an important use of the Automatic Identification Systems (AIS), because it offers support to users to evaluate if a vessel is in trouble or causing trouble. For instance, it can be used to detect if a ship is doing something that may cause an accident or if it has changed its route to avoid bad weather condition. In this work, a new method for finding anomalies in the ships' movements is proposed. The method analyzes the trajectory of ships from a geometrical perspective. The trajectory of the ship is compared with a near-optimal path that is generated by a graph search algorithm. The proposed method extracts some scale-invariant features from the real trajectory and also from the optimal movement pattern, and it compares the two sets of features to generate an abnormality score. The method is unsupervised and it does not require training. Instead of labeling the trajectories as normal/abnormal it calculates a score value that denotes the extent of abnormality. The scoring scheme provides a ranking system in which the user can sort the trajectories based on their abnormality score. This is useful when dealing with large number of trajectories and the user wants to picks the most abnormal cases. For the evaluation, the method was run on three months data of North Pacific Ocean and score values were generated. Among the entire dataset, 100 randomly chosen trajectories were labeled by an expert. After applying a threshold on the score value, the proposed method had 94% accuracy.","maritime data,Clustering algorithms,randomly chosen trajectories,optimal movement pattern,anomaly detection,North Pacific Ocean,Marine vehicles,abnormality score,Mathematical model,Feature extraction,geometrical trajectories analysis,scale-invariant features,ships,marine engineering,bad weather condition,AIS,Oceans,near-optimal path,ship trajectory,ship movements,graph theory,graph search algorithm,Joining processes,score values,search problems,Trajectory,automatic identification systems,"
"a data mining method to extract traffic network for maritime transport management","2023","Maritime traffic network is essential for navigation efficiency and safety of the maritime transport system. This study proposes a framework for extracting maritime traffic network based on Automatic Identification System (AIS) data. The framework consists of maritime traffic pattern recognition, semantic routes extraction, route decomposition, and network generation. Firstly, a data-driven method is introduced to recognize ship behavior patterns and extends the single ship behaviors to regional characteristics to determine the departure-arrival areas. Then, based on the different combination of departure-arrival areas, the ship trajectories are classified to traffic groups. Subsequently, the grid-system is used to rasterize each traffic group, which realizes the fusion of trajectory data and geographic location information. Finally, to obtain the main routes and navigation channels, the extraction method is introduced by establishing the cumulative grid importance function. The main routes, together with the navigation channels, compose the maritime traffic network. The method is applied to AIS data in the Beibu Gulf, and the results show that the traffic network contains 12 stop areas, 4 entry/exit locations, 13 main routes as well as their corresponding navigation channels. It is therefore concluded that the proposed method helps (1) provide a theoretical framework to obtain and analyze the maritime traffic network and (2) enrich navigation channel identification methods for maritime transport management.","Maritime traffic network,Maritime transport management,AIS,Machine learning,Big data analytics,"

"unsupervised reconstruction of sea surface currents from ais maritime traffic data using learnable variational models","2021","Space oceanography missions, especially altimeter missions, have considerably improved the observation of sea surface dynamics over the last decades. They can however hardly resolve spatial scales below ~ 100km. Meanwhile the AIS (Automatic Identification System) monitoring of the maritime traffic implicitly conveys information on the underlying sea surface currents as the trajectory of ships is affected by the current. Here, we show that an unsupervised variational learning scheme provides new means to elucidate how AIS data streams can be converted into sea surface currents. The proposed scheme relies on a learnable variational framework and relate to variational auto-encoder approach coupled with neural ODE (Ordinary Differential Equation) solving the targeted ill-posed inverse problem. Through numerical experiments on a real AIS dataset, we demonstrate how the proposed scheme could significantly improve the reconstruction of sea surface currents from AIS data compared with state-of-the-art methods, including altimetry-based ones.","AIS maritime traffic data,neural ODE,unsupervised learning,sea surface currents,size 100.0 km,space oceanography missions,AIS dataset,learnable variational models,variational learning,AIS data streams,ocean circulation,unsupervised variational learning scheme,Sea surface,unsupervised reconstruction,Artificial intelligence,Surface reconstruction,Numerical models,targeted ill-posed inverse problem,data assimilation,learnable variational framework,Training,Sea surface currents,Trajectory,sea surface dynamics,variational auto-encoder approach,AIS monitoring,Inverse problems,oceanographic techniques,"
"permeability and voids influence on the thermal signal, as inferred by multitemporal uav-based infrared and visible images","2020","This work presents for the first time associated thermal anomalies and deformations over subsurface cavities/voids located within two harbour quays in Le Havre Harbourg, Normandy, France. An U.A.V. (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) was used to acquire visible and thermal images over a diurnal cycle (from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m.). The visible images were processed to realize an altimetric model of the platforms by mean of the photogrammetric method, while the thermal infrared (TIR) images were used to study the evolution of their surface temperatures. The obtained 3D model shows the location of five topographic depressions on both quays. The analysis of the evolution of the surface thermal field leads to the detection of cold thermal anomalies that are (1) not correlated to surface properties, and (2) spatially associated to the flanks of the five topographic depressions. Using a 2D conductive-radiative model, we show that these anomalies are not directly due to the thermally insulating effect of an air-filled area. Finally, we conclude that preferential infiltration and subsequent evaporation in the micro-fracturation present within the flanks of the depressions may be responsible for the strong cooling of these zones.","Thermal infrared,Photogrammetry,Remote Sensing,infiltration,Subsurface cavity,Natural hazards,UAV,"
"remote sensing satellite technology to determine the center of the maritime defense logistics route for securing the indonesian capital city (ikn)","2022","Displacement of the capital of Indonesia has been provided for in Law Number 3 of 2022, namely the IKN Nusantara which is one of the centers of gravity or the center of national strategic strength so that security for the area is very much needed. In order to secure the IKN from all possible enemy attacks, a military defense base is needed that functions as a Logistics support center to support all military operations. The purpose of this study is to determine a strategic location as a center for maritime defense logistics distribution lines in order to secure the IKN area using the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) method combined with satellite image analysis using a Geographic Information System (GIS) by considering the criteria and sub-criteria in determining the location center for maritime defense logistics distribution lines. The results of the research from the AHP weighting method show that the priority order of criteria based on experts is safety from natural conditions, population conditions, environmental locations, distribution line conditions, and required cost. The results of remote sensing satellite image data processing with analysis using Geographic Information Systems with ArcGIS software shows that the results of satellite image overlays are equipped with regional boundaries and routes around IKN. The determination of the location of the center of the distribution line for the defense logistics of the marine sector is concentrated in Samboja District, surely in the Kampung Lama Village which is also used as the location point for the pier plan.

"measurement campaign and mathematical model construction for the ship zodiak magnetic signature reproduction","2021","The paper presents the partial work done within the framework of the EDA Siramis II project focused on magnetic signature reproduction of ships. Reproduction is understood here as the ability to determine the magnetic anomaly of the local Earth magnetic field in any direction and at any measurement depth due to the presence of the analysed object. The B-91 type hydrographic ship Zodiak was selected as the real case study. The work was divided into two main stages: the development of a measurement campaign taking into account physical measurements, and the development of a mathematical model on the basis of the measured values. The measurement campaign included: preparation of the measuring range, selection of equipment for the measurement of magnetic quantities and geographical location, and data recording while the ship passes the measuring point according to the designated course. As a result of the measurement campaign, magnetic flux density components were collected in different positions in relation to the measuring instruments and the ship's heading. A multi-dipole model was used to build the mathematical model in accordance with the idea of inverse modelling. The effectiveness of this model was previously checked on synthetic data of virtual ships generated using the finite element method. Experiments performed with simulation models were helpful in determining the structure of the model, the nature of the data, and the number of samples needed to properly determine the multi-dipole model parameters. The parameters were determined using the nonlinear least squares method according to the idea of data fitting. The classical Ridge and Lasso regularization methods were applied to prevent the developed multi-dipole model from overfitting. Other regularization methods based on GPS accuracy marks and modification of fitness functions were also considered. The verification was done using real data: the data generated by the model was compared with patterns recorded during the Zodiak measurement campaign. High degree of conformity of the shape of characteristics was obtained. Moreover, the correctness of model execution was confirmed by low values of quantitative indices such as RMSE and MAE representing modelling errors. The methodology presented in the paper is quite universal and can be used to determine the signatures of other ferromagnetic objects.","Sea measurements,Magnetic anomaly detection,Magnetic variables measurement,Magnetic signatures,Model checking,Electromagnetic modelling,Marine vehicles,Magnetic fields,"
"a maritime data analytics platform for policy recommendation","2015","The Aegean Sea is characterized by an extremely high marine safety risk, mainly due to the significant increase of the traffic of tankers from and to the Black Sea that pass through narrow straits formed by the 1600 Greek islands. Reducing the risk of a ship accident is therefore vital to all socio-economic and environmental sectors. This paper presents a maritime data analytics platform for policy recommendation. The online tool focuses on extracting aggregated vessel risks using spatiotemporal analysis of multilayer information: vessel trajectories, vessel data, meteorological data, bathymetric/ hydrographic data as well as information regarding environmentally important areas (e.g. protected high-risk areas, etc.). The web interface enables user-friendly spatiotemporal queries at the front-end, while a series of data mining functionalities extracts aggregated statistics regarding: (a) marine risks and accident probabilities for particular areas (b) trajectories clustering information (c) general marine statistics (vessel types, etc.). Employing the above tool, if-then-scenarios can be constructed and resulting statistics and diagrams can provide essential arguments at maritime policy makers.","maritime data analytics platform,bathymetric-hydrographic data,if-then-scenarios,multilayer information:,Spatiotemporal phenomena,Greek islands,Marine vehicles,Monitoring,Aegean sea,spatiotemporal database,socio-economic sectors,vessel data,statistical analysis,maritime policy makers,data analysis,trajectories clustering information,marine safety,spatiotemporal analysis,marine engineering,Accidents,general marine statistics,marine risks,policy recommendation,pattern clustering,aggregated vessel risks,vessel trajectories,Black sea,bathymetry,narrow straits,accident probabilities,Histograms,Trajectory,meteorological data,Marine safety,high marine safety risk,user-friendly spatiotemporal queries,Data mining,environmental sectors,vessel trajectory visualization,query processing,"
"elemental geochemistry and organic facies of selected cretaceous coals from the benue trough basin in nigeria: implication for paleodepositional environments","2022","Benue Trough basin is geologically subdivided into three segments. It consists of marine and continental sediments that are affected by folding movements. In the upper section, the continental coal-bearing Campano-Maastrichtian-age is found within Gombe Sandstone and the Cenozoic Kerri-Kerri Formation of the Tertiary. In the middle segment, the late Turonian/early Santonian coal-bearing Awgu Formation lies conformably on the Ezeaku Formation. In the lower part, shales at Nkporo mark marine incursion and deposition of the Maastrichtian Mamu Formation coal measures. Cretaceous coal samples taken from the three segments of Benue Trough basin were examined using ultimate and proximate, organic petrographic, x-ray fluorescence (XRF) and laser ablation-induced coupled plasma spectroscopy (LA-ICPMS) analytical techniques. Results of trace element ratios, Ce/Ce* values (“where Ce* is the theoretical Ce value derived from a chondrite-normalized rare earth element (REE) pattern”), authigenic uranium values, and low hydrogen content indicate deposition under oxic to suboxic conditions. However, the V/Ni and V/Sc ratios indicate under oxic, suboxic to reducing conditions. The Y/Ho values for selected coals are lower than the range for seawater, indicating terrigenous influence. The Sr/Ba values indicate low influence of saline water during deposition and a strong continental rather than marine influence. High value of vitrinite and low proportion of liptinite/intertinite suggest that peat in the study areas were situated on the irregular basin floor where sediment thicknesses vary from place to place thus the depositional environments shifted causing mineral matter filling in coal. Based on the tissue preservation index (TPI) and gelification index (GI), LFB, CHK, OKB, LMZ, IMG; and ENG (high GI and high TPI) were deposited in telmatic facies; wet-forest swamps with rapid organic matter accumulation. This trend indicates mild humification and strong gelification of plant tissues which ascribed to high rate of subsidence with wood- and bark-derived telovitrinite. The MGA peats were deposited in terrestrial facies in a dry-forest swamp with wood-derived telo-inertinite. The coal samples code-named IMG and ENG were deposited in planar margin mires. However, coal samples code-named LFB, CHK and LMZ were deposited in planar central mires. Lastly, OKB and MGA were deposited in transitional-wet and transitional-dry mire. The low V and Ni concentrations, low H/C, high O/C, high C/N, and very low N/C ratios <0.05 implies Type III land-plant organic matter that is not oil-prone. The depositional environments interpretations of investigated coal seams indicate that the coals were deposited within a telmatic, limnic, limno-telmatic and open march zone. Generally, a combination of results from inorganic geochemistry and organic petrology is required for precise and all-inclusive determination of coal depositional environments.","Macerals,Coal,Petroleum source evaluation,Benue Trough,Depositional facies,"

"rapid prototyping of high performance fuzzy computing applications using high level gpu programming for maritime operations support","2011","The advent of relatively cheap general purpose graphics processing units (GPUs) is having a huge impact on scientific computing. This is opening the door to high performance fuzzy computing (HPFC) to the masses, due to the low cost and the possibility to have GPUs on desktop computers at home. Furthermore, even mobile HPFC seems imminent, provided that your laptop is equipped with a general purpose GPU. Very recently another innovation has occurred: the availability of libraries for high level GPU programming. By using them, the programmer avoids the necessity of having detailed knowledge of the GPU's hardware architecture. The availability of such facility on Matlab (today among the most used rapid prototyping software) is also opening the door to the rapid prototyping of high performance applications, in general, and to the rapid prototyping of HPFC, in particular. In this work we show how to speed up an existing Matlab software prototype (which computes spatial maps for supporting decision making during maritime operations) with little effort.

"insights from archaeological analysis and interpretation of marine data sets to inform marine cultural heritage management and planning of wave and tidal energy development for orkney waters and the pentland firth, ne scotland","2014","The Orkney archipelago has a rich heritage that includes the Heart of Neolithic Orkney World Heritage Site, Viking settlements, harbours supplying Hudson's Bay Company ships, and the wartime naval base of Scapa Flow. This rich history has left its mark on the seabed but accurate maps showing the location and character of surviving seabed archaeology do not exist to the same extent as for archaeology on land. ORCA Marine was commissioned by Historic Scotland to work with the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland in interrogating marine data sets to enhance historic environment records of Orkney Waters and the Pentland Firth. These waters were prioritised for their history of maritime activity and to help guide planning and developments in an area highlighted by the Scottish Government for marine renewable energy. A variety of recent and legacy datasets, including wreck databases; sonar data gathered by public sector bodies; aerial photography; seabed cores; Admiralty charts; and local knowledge, were examined for their effectiveness in discovering and interpreting marine cultural heritage cost-effectively. A methodology was developed that enabled marine cultural heritage information to be quickly assimilated within the national and regional inventories for dissemination online. Polygonisation of records resulted in GIS-based shapefiles identifying site extents, and areas of archaeological potential in relation to wrecks, submerged prehistoric landscapes, anchorages and fishing areas. Substantial gaps in data coverage were identified and areas of the seabed have been surveyed at resolutions that are sufficient to detect large upstanding remains such as iron shipwrecks but insufficient to identify smaller archaeological features. Other geophysical datasets have been created at a resolution detailed enough to allow the recognition of smaller anomalies but in some cases processing of the data has removed small anomalies of interest to archaeologists. Intensively used marine areas often contain the most artefactual remains such as historic ports being developed to service the marine renewable industry. Zones of high wave and tidal energy favoured for renewable energy devices include navigation channels and hazards where a large number of wrecks are documented. Transmission cable routes cross deep water where 20th-century wartime losses occurred. Planning and development of infrastructure relating to renewables may also interact with significant built heritage and archaeology on the foreshore and coast edge.",""
"dem analyses and morphotectonic interpretation: the plio-quaternary evolution of the eastern ligurian alps, italy","2012","The Ligurian Alps (Italy) straddle a complex and ill-defined tectonic transition that accommodates Eurasia–Adria shortening driving concurrent growth of the western Alps and northern Apennines. We focus on the Plio-Quaternary landscape evolution of the eastern part of the Ligurian Alps with the goal of defining the active tectonics through an analysis of topography, drainage networks, and river long profiles. The Ligurian Alps have a steep, seaward-facing escarpment with topographic features reminiscent of the geomorphic markers preserved on both actively-uplifting coastlines and passive margins. For example, there are seaward-facing benches that are thought to be uplifted marine terraces common to active margins; but the drainage divide of the seaward escarpment shows clear evidence of recent northward migration into the Po foreland, a process consistent with escarpment retreat characteristic of passive or subsiding margins. This study explores the active tectonics consistent with these diverse landscape evolution pathways. Our analysis reveals that rock-type strongly throttles the development of topographic relief, drainage networks, and northward migration of the drainage divide. However, we also identify segments of the escarpment that indicate recent base level falls through an analysis of modeled channel steepness and comparison with mean hillslope gradient. The base level falls are consistent with numerous barbed tributaries that are best explained as recent stream captures. No significant correlation among the stream captures at the drainage divide, suspected marine terraces at the coast, Ligurian Sea bathymetry, and active seismicity indicates that the escarpment is the footwall of a segmented normal fault. This normal fault is embedded in a regionally subsiding margin where actively uplifting segments lead to a straightened, pinned drainage divide, whereas, relatively inactive segments permit divide migration into the footwall block. These results are broadly consistent with rock uplift increasing eastward toward Genova across the long-suspected Alps–Apennine Sestri–Voltaggio fault zone. They highlight the respective roles of legacy structures, rock-type, and localized rock uplift in constructing a landscape in an otherwise extending and subsiding crustal retrowedge of an active subduction plate boundary.","Tectonic geomorphology,DEM analysis,Ligurian Alps,River longitudinal profile,"
"environment-aware coverage optimization for space-ground integrated maritime communications","2020","To satisfy the growing demand for broadband maritime communications, space-ground integrated maritime communication networks (MCNs) arise, which are envisioned to take full advantage of both satellites and terrestrial shore-based networks. In practice, due to the frequent beam hopping of satellites and the limited number of geographically available onshore base-station sites, the space-ground integrated MCN usually presents a highly non-cellular network structure, leading to both challenging blind zones and coverage areas with severe interference. In this paper, we optimize the coverage performance by exploiting the marine environment information. Particularly, the transmit antenna correlation is estimated using the location and mobility information of scatterers on the sea, such as lighthouses, reefs, islands, and vessels. The position and attitude information of satellites are also utilized for interference estimation. Based on that, we optimize the input covariance and precoding matrix to maximize the ergodic sum capacity for all mobile terminals within the coverage. It is a complicated non-convex problem, especially because the ergodic sum capacity is difficult to be expressed straightly without the expectation operator. We introduce an upper bound of the ergodic sum capacity using the path loss and the transmit antenna correlation estimated from the environment information, and then propose an iterative algorithm to solve the problem by solving a set of convex subproblems. The proposed environment-aware scheme is evaluated using the real-world geographic information of a coastal area of China. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can greatly improve the ergodic sum capacity and the energy efficiency compared with existing approaches, and achieve dynamic coverage to match the non-cellular network structure.","Satellites,complicated nonconvex problem,ergodic sum capacity maximization,space-ground integrated MCN,Antenna arrays,matrix algebra,input covariance optimization,convex programming,path loss,non-cellular,environment-aware coverage optimization,Transmitting antennas,concave programming,coverage performance optimization,beam hopping,space-ground integrated maritime communications,dynamic coverage,environment-aware scheme,precoding matrix,scatterer mobility information,precoding,Maritime communications,broadband maritime communications,Propagation losses,satellite-based networks,real-world geographic information,Correlation,radiofrequency interference,terrestrial shore-based networks,coverage optimization,transmitting antennas,satellite antennas,iterative methods,noncellular network structure,Optimization,onshore base-station sites,broadband networks,marine environment information,marine communication,attitude information,interference estimation,upper bound,transmit antenna correlation,Interference,iterative algorithm,mobile terminals,energy efficiency,"

"the vöhrum section (northwest germany) and the aptian/albian boundary","2003","Prior to 1947, the Aptian/Albian boundary was placed at the base of the Nolaniceras nolani ammonite Zone. From (Trav. Lab. Géol. Fac. Sci. 26 (1947) 17), until (Cret. Res. 20 (1999) 609), the base of the Albian stage has been taken at the first appearance of the ammonite Leymeriella (Proleymeriella) schrammeni, a species known only from a limited area of northwest Germany. The early succession of Leymeriella and its relationship with ammonite taxa from the underlying Hypacanthoplites jacobi ammonite Zone can only be determined in the northwest German sections, all of which are ephemeral clay pits. Thus, the definition of the base of the Albian on these criteria cannot be used in a global context. The positioning of the boundary has been the subject of intense discussion in the last years. After the second International Symposium on Cretaceous Stage Boundaries in 1995 (Bull. Inst. R. Sci. Nat. Belgique, Sci. Terre 66 (1996) 45). (Cret. Res. 20 (1999) 609) lowered the boundary to the base of his Hypacanthoplites rubricosus ammonite Subzone without describing a global boundary stratotype section. (Cret. Res. 21 (2000) 591) raised the boundary to the alleged first occurrence (FO) of Leymeriella tardefurcata in a permanent section, but neither proposals can be accepted globally (Cret. Res. 23 (2002) 1). (Cret. Res. 22 (2001) 677) supported by (Cret. Res. 23 (2002) 1), suggested a radical solution by raising the boundary to the base of the geographically widespread Lyelliceras lyelli ammonite Subzone, currently the base of the Middle Albian.

"multi-scale collision risk estimation for maritime traffic in complex port waters","2023","Ship collision risk estimation is an essential component of intelligent maritime surveillance systems. Traditional risk estimation approaches, which can only analyze traffic risk in one specific scale, reveal a significant challenge in quantifying the collision risk of a traffic scenario from different spatial scales. This is detrimental to understanding the traffic situations and supporting effective anti-collision decision-making, particularly as maritime traffic complexity grows and autonomous ships emerge. In this study, a systematic multi-scale collision risk estimation approach is newly developed to capture traffic conflict patterns under different spatial scales. It extends the application of the complex network theory and a node deletion method to quantify the interactions and dependencies among multiple ships within encounter scenarios, enabling collision risk to be evaluated at any spatial scale. Meanwhile, an advanced graph-based clustering framework is introduced to search for the optimal spatial scales for risk evaluation. Extensive numerical experiments based on AIS data in Ningbo_Zhoushan Port are implemented to evaluate the model performance. Experimental results reveal that the proposed approach can strengthen maritime situational awareness, identify high-risk areas and support strategic maritime safety management. This work therefore sheds light on improving the intelligent levels of maritime surveillance and promoting maritime traffic automation.","Intelligent maritime surveillance,Maritime safety,Multi-scale collision risk,Graph clustering,Network theory,"

"graph signal variation detection: a novel approach for identifying and reconstructing ship ais tangled trajectories","2023","Tangles are a common anomaly in Automatic Identification System (AIS) data, resulting from disorder in time sequences. They increase the spatial complexity of trajectories, making existing methods unable to fully recognize and process them. This will seriously affect the analysis of ship behavior. Furthermore, existing methods often directly remove after recognition, resulting in a significant loss of local information. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an algorithm called Graph Signal Variation Detection (GSVD) to recognize and reconstruct tangles. Initially, data preprocessing is conducted to remove redundant and stationary points. Then, construct the vertices and edges of the graph using indicators integrating AIS data features and ship trajectories, respectively. The tangled region is identified by calculating the total variation theory of the graph. The tangled region is reconstructed using the greedy heuristic, and the optimal reconstruction path is determined by combining total variation quantization. Finally, the GSVD is compared with four prevailing methods, through qualitative and quantitative analyses. The results demonstrate that the GSVD surpasses the other methods in terms of recognition accuracy, recall rates, and false alarm rates. Additionally, the GSVD can effectively reconstruct the tangle.","Total variation,Trajectory preprocessing,Graph signal,AIS data,Greedy algorithm,"

"a strategy for detecting derelict fishing gear at sea","2012","Derelict fishing gear (DFG) is a highly persistent form of marine pollution known to cause environmental and economic damage. At-sea detection of DFG would support pelagic removal of this gear to prevent and minimize impacts on marine environments and species. In 2008, experts in marine debris, oceanography, remote sensing, and marine policy outlined a strategy to develop the capability to detect and ultimately remove DFG from the open ocean. The strategy includes three interrelated components: understanding the characteristics of the targeted DFG, indirectly detecting DFG by modeling likely locations, and directly detecting pelagic DFG using remote sensing. Together, these components aim to refine the search area, increase the likelihood of detection, and decrease mitigation response time, thereby providing guidance for removal operations. Here, we present this at-sea detection strategy, relate it to relevant extant research and technology, and identify gaps that currently prevent successful at-sea detection and removal of DFG.","Remote sensing,Marine debris,Derelict fishing gear,"
"system controls of coastal and open ocean oxygen depletion","2021","The epoch of the Anthropocene, a period during which human activity has been the dominant influence on climate and the environment, has witnessed a decline in oxygen concentrations and an expansion of oxygen-depleted environments in both coastal and open ocean systems since the middle of the 20th century. This paper provides a review of system-specific drivers of low oxygen in a range of case studies representing marine systems in the open ocean, on continental shelves, in enclosed seas and in the coastal environment. Identification of similar and contrasting responses within and across system types and corresponding oxygen regimes is shown to be informative both in understanding and isolating key controlling processes and provides a sound basis for predicting change under anticipated future conditions. Case studies were selected to achieve a balance in system diversity and global coverage. Each case study describes system attributes, including the present-day oxygen environment and known trends in oxygen concentrations over time. Central to each case study is the identification of the physical and biogeochemical processes that determine oxygen concentrations through the tradeoff between ventilation and respiration. Spatial distributions of oxygen and time series of oxygen data provide the opportunity to identify trends in oxygen availability and have allowed various drivers of low oxygen to be distinguished through correlative and causative relationships. Deoxygenation results from a complex interplay of hydrographic and biogeochemical processes and the superposition of these processes, some additive and others subtractive, makes attribution to any particular driver challenging. System-specific models are therefore required to achieve a quantitative understanding of these processes and of the feedbacks between processes at varying scales.","Deoxygenation,Eutrophication,Respiration,Global warming,Stratification,Ventilation,"

The system described in this article is a wireless mesh network based on the IEEE 802.16. An analysis of the node connectivity based on real ship traffic data shows that the network is feasible in shipping lanes with a high density of ships. The system also considers the use of an intelligent middleware to allow communications to switch back to a satellite link in cases where neighboring ships are sparse or at locations far away from mesh base stations. Protocol enhancements to both the Medium Access Control (MAC) and networking layers and a hardware design that features multiple transceivers and the implementation of antenna switching to counter sea wave reflection and rocking problems are presented. Measurements of field trials show that the proposed wireless mesh network could be an effective solution for maritime communications.","medium access control,high-speed maritime wireless mesh network,antenna switching implementation,wireless mesh networks,intelligent middleware,radio transceivers,Marine vehicles,node connectivity,protocol enhancement,Mesh networks,Sea measurements,real ship traffic data,Wireless networks,MAC,antennas,TRI-media Telematic Oceanographic Network project,access protocols,ships,rocking problem,low-cost maritime communication system,Maritime communication,Sea surface,networking layer,multiple transceiver,mesh base station,satellite link,telecommunication traffic,TRITON,satellite links,sea wave reflection,marine communication,IEEE 802.16 standard,IEEE 802.16 Standards,WiMax,middleware,"
"a multiagent system for maritime navigation simulation","2005","The paper introduces the principles underlying the TRANS prototype, a multi-agent system oriented to concurrent maritime navigations. TRANS integrates several multi-agent modelling notions such as role and group behaviours, it extends those to the concepts of permanent and temporary roles and allows for priority and constraint management. Agents model either mobile entities or static geographical references. Mobile agents, i.e., ships behave according to international navigation rules. A Java-based prototype implements those modelling concepts and supports simulation of concurrent navigations. Overall the TRANS prototype acts as a simulation environment that can be used for either training or real monitoring purposes.","static geographical reference,Mobile agents,international navigation rules,Monitoring,Marine vehicles,computerised navigation,Autonomous agents,Watches,ships,TRANS prototype,Prototypes,role behaviour,mobile entity,Multiagent systems,Virtual prototyping,Java,group behaviour,Navigation,maritime navigation simulation,multiagent system,"
"assessment of trace metal contamination in surficial fine-grained sediments and mussel, mytilus galloprovincialis from safi areas in the northwestern atlantic coast of morocco","2020","During the spring season, trace metal concentrations of cadmium (Cd) and copper (Cu) were investigated in surficial fine-grained sediments and the blue mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis. The study was conducted on the Atlantic coast of Morocco at two selected points along Safi shores, a supposed clean station and a recognized metal-contaminated one. The main objectives were to assess the pollution status of these two stations and to highlight the environmental and human risks associated with metal contamination. The bioavailability and the bioaccumulation of the selected metals, several physiological and biometric parameters of mussels were assessed at both sampling stations. As expected, the station located near industry plants showed the highest metal concentrations in the two compartments and was associated with lower values in the physiological and biometric indices. At the mussel scale, inter-station and inter-tissue variations in metal concentrations were observed showing a preferential accumulation within the digestive gland. Besides, strong reliable negative relations of Cd and Cu concentrations were obtained with physiological indices. Surprisingly, a significant occurrence of both selected metals was recorded at the location assumed as a reference station. Therefore, the hypothesis that this station presumed to be clean and currently used as a control station must be reconsidered. As for the risk for the consumer, the estimated daily intake (EDI) of Cd and Cu indicated a potential health risk through mussel consumption since the EDI values were markedly above the international guidelines and threshold levels for human consumption. Finally, our data were compared to those previously obtained along the Safi coastline (NW Morocco) and other geographical regions, including the Mediterranean and western Atlantic areas within the temperate zone.","Bioaccumulation,Mediterranean blue mussel,Pollution indices,Risk assessment,Metal contamination,Marine sediments,"
"marine parameters from synergy of optical and radar satellite data","2002","In 2001 the European Space Agency ESA will launch the earth observation satellite ENVISAT. It will carry several instruments that provide new opportunities to measure oceanographic variables. Together, they represent the main measurement techniques of satellite oceanography, and complement each other in an ideal manner. These instruments are to be used in synergy to: &#x02022;Improve the analysis of measured wind and ocean wave fields, and thereby improve weather forecasting at weather centers;&#x02022;Determine the extent and variables of sea ice and develop a five-day sea ice prediction model, to support maritime shipping and offshore activities;&#x02022;Monitor and map sediment and suspended matter transport in coastal regions, especially in areas with large river estuaries, which greatly affects shipping lanes, harbors, and dredging activities;&#x02022;Monitor hydrobiological and bio-geochemical variables related to water quality in coastal regions and large inland waters, which affects ecology, coastal development, aquaculture, drinking water supplies, and tourism. To prepare the oceanographic community to make best use of the ENVISAT sensors in the pre-launch phase, existing algorithms to derive marine parameters are used and validated using data from the ERS SAR, the ERS RA, SeaWiFS and IRS MOS sensors now in operation. Derived products are used to address problems that can best be tackled using the synergy of radar and optical data, such as the effect of surface slicks on radar wind measurements, of sea state on ocean color, of wind and waves on the resuspension of suspended matter, and of wind and waves on sea ice variables.",""
"temporal-spatio evolution of maritime accidents","2023","As an important passage connecting China with Southeast Asia, South Asia and the Middle East, the South China Sea has an important geopolitical and economic strategic position. Based on geographic information system (GIS), this paper studies the spatial distribution characteristics of maritime accidents in the South China Sea from 1984 to 2021 in the Lloydâ€™s List Intelligence(LLI)database, and makes a spatial analysis of maritime accidents in the South China Sea. It is concluded that the hot spots of accidents in the South China Sea are mainly distributed in several important ports and coastal areas of the South China Sea, showing an obvious spatial clustering phenomenon. Meanwhile, combined with the time evolution of the past 40 years, this paper analyzes the spatio-temporal evolution of maritime accidents in the South China Sea, evaluates the risk of different maritime accidents and proposes corresponding prevention strategies, including strengthening supervision, conducting operation and technical training for sailors, using digital system to manage cargo and improving information sharing mechanism to promote cooperation among neighboring countries. In order to improve the safety of navigation in the South China Sea, the results of this study provide a scientific basis for the prevention of maritime accidents in the South China Sea, and are of great significance to the safety management and development of the South China Sea region.","South China Sea region,Risk prevention,Information sharing,safety management,Sea measurements,Asia,ships,digital system,economic strategic position,Graphical models,Southeast Asia,Safety management,geographic information systems,geopolitical strategic position,Middle East,GIS,South Asia,Training,geographic information system,Navigation,A maritime accident,maritime accidents,Space-time evolution,The South China Sea,Lloyd List Intelligence database,"
"unsupervised extraction of maritime patterns of life from automatic identification system data","2019","This paper presents an unsupervised approach to extract maritime Patterns of Life (PoL) from historical Automatic Identification System (AIS) data based on a low-dimensional synthetic representation of ship routes. Recent advances in long-term vessel motion modeling through Ornstein-Uhlenbeck mean-reverting stochastic processes allow to encode knowledge about maritime traffic via a compact graph-based model where waypoints are graph vertices and the connections between them, i.e., the navigational legs, are graph edges. The resulting directed graph ultimately leads to the detection and statistical characterization of recurrent maritime traffic patterns. To demonstrate its effectiveness and applicability to real-world case studies, the proposed methodology has been tested on two extensive AIS datasets, collected in the areas of two operational trials of EU-H2020's MARISA (Maritime Integrated Surveillance Awareness) project.","Ornstein-Uhlenbeck mean-reverting stochastic processes,surveillance,statistical characterization,graph vertices,Pattern-of-Life analysis,long-term vessel motion modeling,Marine vehicles,marine navigation,DBSCAN clustering,directed graph,Stochastic processes,EU-H2020 MARISA project,maritime situational awareness,graph edges,maritime integrated surveillance awareness,patterns of life,Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process,change detection,ships,recurrent maritime traffic patterns,PoL,marine engineering,stochastic processes,Automatic Identification System,low-dimensional synthetic representation,Data models,unsupervised extraction,ship routes,directed graphs,maritime traffic graph,pattern clustering,Artificial intelligence,maritime patterns,Legged locomotion,AIS datasets,Navigation,Data mining,historical automatic identification system data,graph-based model,"
"adaptive detection tracking system for autonomous uav maritime patrolling","2020","Nowadays, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are considered reliable systems, suitable for several autonomous applications, especially for target detection and tracking. Although significant developments were achieved in object detection systems over the last decades using the deep learning technique known as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), there are still research gaps in this area. In this paper, we present a new object detection-tracking algorithm that can be used on low power consuming processing boards. In particular, we analysed a specific application scenario in which a UAV patrols coastlines and autonomously classifies different kind of marine objects. Current state of the art solutions propose centralised architectures or flying systems with human in the loop, making the whole system poorly efficient and not scalable. On the contrary, applying a Deep Learning detection system that runs on commercial Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) makes UAVs potentially more efficient than humans (especially for dull tasks like coastline patrolling) and the whole system becomes easily scalable because each UAV can fly independently and the Ground Control Station does not represent a bottleneck. To deal with this task, a database consisting of more than 115000 images was created to train and test several CNN architectures. Furthermore, an adaptive detection-tracking algorithm was introduced to make the whole system faster by optimizing the balancing between detecting new objects and tracking existing targets. The proposed solution is based on the measure of the tracking confidence and the frame similarity, by means of the Structural SIMilarity (SSIM) index, computed both globally and locally. Finally, the developed algorithms were tested on a realistic scenario by means of a UAV test-bed.","unmanned aerial vehicles,coastline patrolling,target detection,robot vision,adaptive detection tracking,Machine learning,Feature extraction,target tracking,service robots,object detection tracking,CNN,deep learning detection system,graphics processing units,Target tracking,object detection,pinhole camera model,image classification,autonomous UAV maritime patrolling,neural net architecture,convolutional neural nets,autonomous aerial vehicles,convolutional neural networks,Training,Convolutional neural networks,Unmanned aerial vehicles,CNN architectures,Detection-Tracking System,structural similarity index,autonomous classification,learning (artificial intelligence),Detectors,UAV,"
"a marine geoarchaeological investigation for the cultural anthesis and the sustainable growth of methoni, greece","2020","The ‘Evolved GE.N.ESIS Project’ highlights the underwater cultural heritage resources off the coast of Methoni, Greece that could locally drive sustainable socioeconomic growth. An integrated marine geophysical survey, a hydrographic survey, and a GNSS survey were conducted off Methoni, recording six historic wreck sites, artefacts, the ruins of a submerged prehistoric settlement, and the town's ancient harbour/breakwater, as well as the geophysical properties of the underwater environment. The preliminary project results present bathymetric surfaces, backscatter intensity and magnetic maps, drawings, and seismic reflection profiles of the underwater antiquities and of the seabed, all fused in a 3D geographical platform. The results also shed light on the archaeological potential of the site, the nearshore physical processes, and their effect on the underwater archaeological resources. The project outcomes have shown that the establishment of an underwater archaeological park and diving sites at the cultural heritage sites will support cultural tourism development in the area and will have a positive impact on local socioeconomic development. The underwater archaeological park should comply with the basic principles of a site management plan – one that is established in the context of an integrated coastal management plan that identifies the maritime synergies or conflicts among human activities, archaeological resources, and the local environment, and utilises the 3D synthesis of marine knowledge from the project outcomes as a decision-making tool.","Bathymetry,Marine geophysics,Hydrography,Underwater cultural heritage,Site evolution,Maritime archaeology,"
"accelerated loss of alpine glaciers in the kodar mountains, south-eastern siberia","2013","The recession of mountain glaciers around the world has been linked to anthropogenic climate change and small glaciers (e.g. <2km2) are thought to be particularly vulnerable, with reports of their disappearance from several regions. However, the response of small glaciers to climate change can be modulated by non-climatic factors such as topography and debris cover and there remain a number of regions where their recent change has evaded scrutiny. This paper presents results of the first multi-year remote sensing survey of glaciers in the Kodar Mountains, the only glaciers in SE Siberia, which we compare to previous glacier inventories from this continental setting that reported total glacier areas of 18.8km2 in ca. 1963 (12.6km2 of exposed ice) and 15.5km2 in 1974 (12km2 of exposed ice). Mapping their debris-covered termini is difficult but delineation of debris-free ice on Landsat imagery reveals 34 glaciers with a total area of 11.72±0.72km2 in 1995, followed by a reduction to 9.53±0.29km2 in 2001 and 7.01±0.23km2 in 2010. This represents a ~44% decrease in exposed glacier ice between ca. 1963 and 2010, but with 40% lost since 1995 and with individual glaciers losing as much as 93% of their exposed ice. Thus, although continental glaciers are generally thought to be less sensitive than their maritime counterparts, a recent acceleration in shrinkage of exposed ice has taken place and we note its coincidence with a strong summer warming trend in the region initiated at the start of the 1980s. Whilst smaller and shorter glaciers have, proportionally, tended to shrink more rapidly, we find no statistically significant relationship between shrinkage and elevation characteristics, aspect or solar radiation. This is probably due to the small sample size, limited elevation range, and topographic setting of the glaciers in deep valleys-heads. Furthermore, many of the glaciers possess debris-covered termini and it is likely that the ablation of buried ice is lagging the shrinkage of exposed ice, such that a growth in the proportion of debris cover is occurring, as observed elsewhere. If recent trends continue, we hypothesise that glaciers could evolve into a type of rock glacier within the next few decades, introducing additional complexity in their response and delaying their potential demise.","Mountain glaciers,Remote sensing,Kodar Mountains,Russia,Climate change,"
"integrated late quaternary chronostratigraphy for san salvador island, bahamas: patterns and trends of morphological change in the land snail cerion","2008","Reconstructing the phylogeny and biogeography of the Caribbean land snail Cerion requires a robust stratigraphic and chronological framework. To this end, we have determined the stratigraphic succession on San Salvador, a Bahamian island with a rich fossil and modern Cerion fauna. A primary purpose of this paper is to independently verify this succession through whole-rock and Cerion aminostratigraphies and AMS 14C-based age models. Over 150 individual Cerion shells were age-ranked from 140 ka to modern using stratigraphic position and reverse-phase HPLC (RPC) amino acid racemization, which was sufficiently sensitive to resolve stratigraphic subunits within the Holocene and late Pleistocene. A secondary purpose of this paper is to assess broad changes in the gross morphology (height, width) of supersets of Cerion from age-ranked lots spanning this ~140 kyr chronostratigraphy. Through each of the three interglacial sequences (i.e., marine isotope stages 5e, 5a, and 1), between-sample trends in mean gross morphology often greatly exceed within-sample variances (±1σ). Live-collected Cerion exhibit a range in gross morphology that nearly encompasses that of the entire fossil sequence. A trend of increasing gross shell size characterizes each of the interglacial phases, with a major step-decrease between marine isotope stages 5a and 1. While between-unit variation is often great in Cerion from SSI, within-unit variation appears unimodal through the record.","land snails,Reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography,The Bahamas,San Salvador Islands,Accelerator mass spectrometry C chronology,Biostratigraphy,Amino acid racemization,"
"variability and propagation of labrador sea water in the southern subpolar north atlantic","2009","The variability of two modes of Labrador Sea Water (LSW) (upper and deep Labrador Sea Water) and their respective spreading in the interior North Atlantic Ocean are investigated by means of repeated ship surveys carried out along the zonal WOCE line A2/AR19 located at 43–48°N (1993–2007) and along the GOOS line at about 48–51°N (1997–2002). Hydrographic section data are complemented by temperature, salinity, and velocity time series recorded by two moorings. They have been deployed at the western flank of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR) in the Newfoundland Basin during 1996–2004. The analysis of hydrographic anomalies at various longitudes points to a gradual eastward propagation of LSW-related signals, which happens on time scales of 3–6 years from the formation region towards the MAR. Interactions of the North Atlantic Current (NAC) with the Deep Western Boundary Current (DWBC) close to Flemish Cap point to the NAC being the main distributor of the different types of LSW into the interior of the Newfoundland Basin. Comparisons between the ship data and the mooring records revealed that the mooring sites are located in a region affected by highly variable flow. The mooring time series demonstrate an elevated level of variability with eddy activity and variability associated with the NAC considerably influencing the LSW signals in this region. Hydrographic data taken from Argo profiles from the vicinity of the mooring sites turned out to mimic quite well the temporal evolution captured by the moorings. There is some indication of occasional southward flow in the LSW layer near the MAR. If this can be considered as a hint to an interior LSW-route, it is at least of minor importance in comparison to the DWBC. It acts as an important supplier for the interior North Atlantic, distributing older and recently formed LSW modes southward along the MAR.","Water mass spreading,Subpolar North Atlantic,Mid-Atlantic Ridge,Ocean circulation,Labrador Sea Water,"
"response strategies of the main forest types to climatic anomalies across croatian biogeographic regions inferred from fapar remote sensing data","2014","Croatia is positioned in the transitional zone of South-eastern Europe and the Mediterranean, a region with frequent occurrence of severe droughts and dry spells, which makes it particularly vulnerable to the impact of climate change. It distends across three main European biogeographical regions – Continental, Alpine and Mediterranean – and therefore has a very high level of forest diversity comprised of 11 out of 14 European forest types. This makes it very convenient to study the exposure of main European forest types to extreme climatic events in the southern limits of their species distribution range. This study provides an assessment of responses of forest vegetation under episodes of climatic anomalies consisting of the most severe historical dry and warm spells in 2000 and 2003, together with the extremely rainy season in 2005 across Croatian territory. The question of interest in this study was to reveal how the existing forest types across the territorial gradient respond to highly expressed extreme climatic variations and to infer some clues about related adaptive strategies. The regional scale approach was applied which previously performed structural delineation of forest cover into eleven main forest groups or bioclimates and were examined considering functional differences. Responses of eleven bioclimatic types were analyzed by time series (1998–2005) of monthly FAPAR (The Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetic Active Radiation) coverage with a spatial resolution of 1.2km, freely available from JRC FAPAR project. To quantify and differentiate the vegetation response in the considered years we adopted indices of resilience (resistance, recovery, resilience and relative resilience). We also provided a modified approach by applying these indices on a seasonal scale to examine the relationship between variations of phenology and ecosystem responses. The results confirmed the modification of seasonality of photosynthetic activity in relation to the altitudinal and spatial gradient. At the intra-seasonal scale, we distinguished specific opportunistic behavior of the common beech and oak forest types to alternating climatic conditions. Beech forest types show a very high ability to shift their phenology to earlier spring warming as a consequence of global warming. However, continental and Mediterranean oak forest types and in particular Aleppo pine and holm oak forests showed a higher increase of FAPAR during rainy events. The revealed capability of some tree species to better exploit rainfall in very wet periodic episodes has to be further evaluated in drawing conclusions about the overall resilience of forests under future climate change scenarios.","Extreme climatic events,Forest resilience,Climate change impacts,Land surface phenology,Forest responses,Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR),"

"former el niño events: records from western south america","1993","The quasi-periodic alterations of the climate in South America and of the oceanographical conditions in the eastern Pacific Ocean, referred to as the “El Niño” phenomenon, are part of a global anomaly in the ocean-atmosphere interactive system (the El Niño-Southern Oscillation, ENSO). As this phenomenon is responsible for the major interannual climatic variability and has a great potential to document links between the atmospheric and oceanic circulations, it is important to understand its mechanism, its boundary conditions and the causes of the variations of its intensity. Many answers to such questions can be sought in the historical and geological record of El Niño occurrences. Former impacts of the El Niño phenomenon along the western coast of South America are documented by remnants of catastrophic rainfalls and associated river floods, records of lake salinity variations, beach ridge sequences and numerous evidences of alterations in the biotic and physical coastal environment. For the last millennium or so, relatively precise (although discontinuous) archaeological and historical data are available. Continuous, high-resolution, proxy records are provided by glaciological data (last 1500 yr) from the Quelccaya ice cap of southern Peru and are potentially available from coral cores from the Galapagos Islands. No marine varves that would permit a detailed and sequential study of El Niño-related oceanographic anomalies during the late Quaternary have yet been obtained off western South America. The reconstruction of the sequence of the main ENSO events during the last millennia is thus hampered by the fact that there are too few continuous records and that these have not necessarily registered every El Niño occurrence and/or the relative intensity of each event. The discontinuous records of major El Niño events are more numerous, but often lack the required chronological accuracy. Obviously, both series of data need to be cross-checked and compared with information (e.g. dendroclimatology and marine varves) from other regions of the globe where climate teleconnections with the ENSO phenomenon can be assessed.",""
"integrated characterization of ancient burial mounds using ert and limited drillings at the hepu han tombs, in coastal area of southern china","2019","The Hepu Han Tombs, located on the south coast of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, in southern China, bordering the Beibu Gulf, can date back to the Han dynasty (206 BCE–220 CE), when Hepu was an important international trade port of the maritime Silk Road, spreading strong and persistent cultural influence to neighboring countries from ancient China, and also connecting China with African, European and other Asian countries in national migration, religious communication, political, trade, technical and cultural exchanges, and so on. The research of the Hepu Han Tombs can offer opportunities to understand the burial customs and the Han culture in the Chinese Han Dynasty. With the aim of detecting the location, depth and geometry of two burial mounds at Jinjiling Site of Hepu Han Tombs, an electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) survey was performed in cooperation with archaeological team to calibrate the results with detailed information from the limited drillings in the area. Besides, series of 2-D ERT sections, acquired above the larger mound, were combined into a “Pseudo 3-D” volume, and iso-resistivity surfaces were further calculated to emphasize the location and lateral variations within the data volume, expected towards a more detailed and quantitative interpretation. Both the 2-D and 3-D resistivity imaging gave a clear evidence of structural details of the burial mounds. The results have shown a general consistency between the geophysical work and traditional archaeological drilling explorations, improving our knowledge on the un-excavated mounds, and allowing detailed pre-excavation plan at the Hepu Han Tombs.","Burial mounds,Hepu Han Tombs,Electrical resistivity tomography (ERT),Drillings,"
"demand and supply-side determinants of electric power consumption and representative roadmaps to 100% renewable systems","2021","The need to transform electric power systems to a cleaner electricity mix to help save the climate is undisputable but existing transition pathways have become unreliable due to inadequate representation of both demand and supply-side determinants of electric power supply, as well as failure to inculcate volatility in electric power systems in the core transition modelling. This study inculcates demand and supply-side determinants to investigate the long- and short-run causal relationships between the electric power system, macroeconomic performance, demography, environmental quality, and capital formation, for Sweden. We also propose and implement econometric and two-stage attention-based machine learning models for volatility-consistent electric power forecasting. Using annual data spanning 1990–2018, the results suggest a long-run relationship exists between electricity generation and the independent variables. Empirical results for the volatility-consistent attention-based machine learning model predict that Sweden’s electric power demand in 2050 could reach ∼112 TWh if conservation practices are implemented, and ∼146 TWh if otherwise. If conservation practices are implemented, evidence from selected volatility-consistent simulations show that Sweden can provide 100% of all her electricity demand from cleaner sources by 2030. The findings depict that Sweden must implement stringent and radical policies to achieve its mid-century green electricity targets.","Demand and supply-side determinants,100% renewable Electricity consumption,Two-stage attention-based recurrent neural network,Volatility-consistent cleaner electricity transition pathways,Causality,Climate change,"
"building resilience through foresight: the case of maritime container shipping firms","2022","Maritime container shipping (MCS) firms represent the backbone of worldwide supply chains. Due to the emergence of global trends and disruptions, MCS firms increasingly face an uncertain environment. Consequently, MCS firms must develop dynamic capabilities to enable the reconfiguration of organizational resources for building resilience in a constantly changing business ecosystem. To create adequate dynamic capabilities, MCS firms need to anticipate the future of their macro environment through advanced foresight techniques. Using a Delphi-based scenario analysis, this study systematically examines scenarios for MCS firmsâ€™ macro environment. Twelve projections for the MCS industry were systematically created and were then assessed by 51 maritime experts. The resulting three distinct scenarios deliver valuable insights for MCS firmsâ€™ executives, whereas the blockchains and drones technology will have already increased efficiency in the short-term scenario â€œpicking the low-hanging fruit,â€ other technological disruptions will only affect the industry in the medium-term scenario â€œexperiencing an era of dichotomy.â€ In the long-term scenario â€œovercoming the obstacles of the generational shift,â€ MCS firms will experience a transfer toward alternative fuel powered and autonomously driven vessels. Offering detailed scenarios for the future MCS macro environment, this study represents a guide for decision-makers on how to create dynamic capabilities in MCS firms to build resilience. Moreover, the results revealed differences in the expertsâ€™ assessments due to their characteristics. Therefore, the study contributes to the academic focus on in-depth diversity analysis in the Delphi methodology and emphasizes the relevance of incorporating multiple stakeholders and panelists in future planning.","Pandemics,freight transportation,maritime,Uncertainty,scenarios,technology foresight,Delphi,Containers,COVID-19,judgmental forecasting,Bibliographies,Industries,Planning,Supply chains,"
"eloran: resilient positioning, navigation, and timing infrastructure in maritime areas","2020","Global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and localization technology have become highly compact and effective. Although GNSS has been proven to be vulnerable to jamming when the signal strength is weak, most vehicles rely on it for navigation. Compared to GNSS, enhanced Loran (eLoran) is more resistant to jamming and is recommended as a realistic alternative to GNSS. Therefore, South Korea embarked on an eLoran testbed development project to provide resilient navigation information for maritime users. The primary goal of this project was to demonstrate that the system can provide a 20-m position accuracy to the maritime user within a 30-km coverage of a differential Loran station. In this paper, we describe the development of the eLoran testbed implementation and the performance of its preliminary experimental results. To confirm the feasibility of the eLoran testbed performance, we installed an eLoran transmitter and two differential Loran stations and subsequently conducted a zero-baseline performance test at the Pyeongtaek differential Loran station with a new eLoran signal. We also conducted a survey to collect conventional Loran signals along the western and southern coastlines of South Korea.

"stratigraphic pattern of soil remnants, cultural and colluvial deposits in a small dry valley in the viking settlement hedeby, northern germany","2023","This study aimed to identify spatial distribution of soil remnants, colluvial and cultural deposits in a small dry valley of the early medieval Viking settlement Hedeby; reconstruct factors of soil destruction and main phases of deposits formation. Hedeby (54° 29′ 27.77″ N, 9° 33′ 54.42″ E) is located approximately 40 km northwest of Kiel, Northern Germany, at the western shore of the lake Haddebyer Noor. The protected status of the settlement as a UNESCO heritage site predetermined the choice of a minimum-destructive technique of coring. The stratigraphy demonstrated that the main factors of soil destruction were surface erosion, incorporation of the soil horizon A into a cultural layer and extraction of soil material for earthwork formation such as construction of the semi-circular fortification rampart. Buried soil horizons were additionally mixed by active local bioturbation. Three periods of deposit formation were identified. The occurrence of soil erosion due to intensive deforestation in the earliest period of settlement erection was indicated by the deepest colluvial layer M1. During the Viking settlement period formation of the exposed colluvial layer M2 and cultural deposits must have been simultaneous but at different locations. After the Viking Age settlement period, the erosion was activated by agricultural land use in late medieval time. This was clearly seen in the central part of the valley, where cultural deposits were covered by colluvium. This study closes a gap in the long-term archaeological and geoarchaeological study of Hedeby, i.e. it contributes to the discussion of the relationship between human activity and landscape development in this significant settlement. Moreover, it brings new knowledge on the large-scale vision of the landscape transformation performed by Viking Age settlers.","Viking Age,Hedeby,Colluvial deposits,Deposit modeling,Past soil erosion,Palaeoenvironmental reconstruction,"

"a multi-task learning-based framework for global maritime trajectory and destination prediction with ais data","2022","Automatic Identification System (AIS) was initially developed for tracking ships and avoiding collisions. As numerous small satellites were launched in recent years, millions of AIS messages are captured by these satellite AIS providers every day. The massive amount of data allow shipping firms and port operators to better predict vessels’ movement. In this study, a computational framework is developed to predict future trajectories and destinations of vessels by applying deep learning to the satellite AIS messages containing self-reporting positioning data. We employed deep learning approaches for large-scale maritime prediction and identifies the most suitable deep neural networks for this specific application. Three prediction models, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Dense Neural Networks (DNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) have been tested in the framework. A multi-task learning architecture is implemented based on test results. Through sharing parameters while training, this architecture enables long-term destination predictions by balancing short-term trajectory predictions. The framework is validated globally with the experiments covering five large-scale sea areas. The experimental results demonstrate that the LSTM model with an average accuracy percentage of 85.1% outperforms the CNN and DNN with accuracy percentages of 68.3% and 78.2% respectively. The LSTM model with multi-task architecture can achieve an accuracy of 87.0%. With the proposed computational framework, AIS data can be utilized for maritime predictions, supporting more complex marine applications and covering more expansive geographic areas.","Vessel trajectory prediction,Automatic Identification System,Vessel origin–destination analysis,Vessel destination prediction,"
"resilience assessment of maritime container shipping networks â€“ a case of the maritime silk road","2019","This paper presents a framework for the resilience assessment of maritime shipping networks by quantifying its recovery performance under natural hazards. The vulnerability of the maritime shipping network is measured according to the variation of network efficiency and the relative size of the largest connected subgraph in the face of the disruption of transportation systems (shutdown of ports). The service performance of the maritime shipping network is indicated by the global network efficiency, and the resilience of maritime shipping network is associated to the network performance loss triangle considering the whole process from a partial disruption to full recovery. The proposed resilience assessment method is applied to a container shipping network of the Maritime Silk Road (MSR) under the storm risks. Two recovery strategies, which are random recovery strategy and multi-centrality based recovery strategy, are adopted respectively, and the recovery performance of the container shipping network under different strategies are comparatively analyzed. The research results can be used to not only support the identification of the weak points of the maritime transportation network along the MSR through vulnerability analysis but also provide a reference for the effective risk management of maritime transportation, so as to improve the safety and reliability of the whole system.","Transportation,Risk management,storm risks,Safety,transportation,Resilience,subgraph,maritime container shipping networks,maritime risk,ships,Containers,marine safety,natural hazards,risk management,storms,maritime transportation network,sea ports,graph theory,network performance loss triangle,global network efficiency,maritime shipping network,Indexes,resilience assessment,Container shipping network,hazards,multi-centrality,Loss measurement,transportation resilience,multicentrality based recovery strategy,transportation systems,random recovery strategy,maritime silk road,"
"a visibility graph approach for path planning and real-time collision avoidance on maritime unmanned systems","2021","In high navigation traffic areas, path planning and collision avoidance is a crucial element of safe navigation, mostly in view of possible future applications in hybrid scenarios where both manned and Autonomous Surface Vehicles (ASV) share the environment.This paper deals with a novel procedure to generate optimal paths in presence of static and moving obstacles. The proposed path planning approach deals with an optimization problem based on the so-called Essential Visibility Graph (EVG) [1], an extension of the standard Visibility Graph (VG) [2], in order to find the minimum cost piecewise linear path between two points in a scenario with several obstacles. Such approach can be used also in presence of multiple ASV or movable obstacles, by using a re-planning procedure to update the EVG over a selected prediction time interval. To make the solution compliant with the current regulation and make ASV behaviour predictable by human pilots on manned vehicles, EVG was extended by implementing a cut procedure based on Collision Regulations (COLREGS) [3]. Finally, the use of Dubins curves provides smooth paths, compliant with physics constraints such as the minimum turn radius.A campaign of numerical simulations was carried out to test the effectiveness of the proposed technique in different operational scenarios. Results show that the algorithm is always able to identify COLREGS-compliant trajectories, in order to avoid collisions and assure minimum safety distance as well. Furthermore, the low computational burden suggests that the proposed procedure can be considered a promising approach for real-time applications.","minimum turn radius,real-time collision avoidance,Autonomous Surface Vehicles,Regulation,Safety,operational scenarios,Costs,COLREGS-compliant trajectories,standard visibility graph,real-time applications,Dubins curves,maritime unmanned systems,movable obstacles,optimization problem,essential visibility graph,cut procedure,manned autonomous surface vehicles,prediction time interval,optimal paths,optimisation,EVG,smooth paths,Essential Visibility Graph,Real-time systems,graph theory,minimum cost piecewise linear path,path planning approach,Numerical simulation,COLREGs,unmanned surface vehicles,mobile robots,high navigation traffic areas,Collision Avoidance,multiple ASV,Navigation,collision avoidance,re-planning procedure,Heuristic algorithms,"
"an overview of cawses-india program with emphasis to equatorial atmospheric coupling processes","2012","This paper presents an overview of CAWSES—India program, highlighting some of the Indian coordinated efforts to understand the Sun−Earth system as a whole, with special emphasis to the equatorial and low latitude phenomena. Two multi-institutional, multi-instrument campaigns, one under ‘Space Weather: Science and Applications’ and the other emphasizing tides under ‘Atmospheric Coupling Processes’ were conducted during February–April 2006. The highlights of the campaigns include improved prediction of equatorial spread-F (ESF) based on a ‘new factor’ combining the strength and asymmetry of the equatorial ionization anomaly (EIA); simultaneous detection of quasi-2-day wave at both E and F region heights; tomographic image showing a Traveling Ionospheric Disturbance (TID) in association with a counter electrojet (CEJ) event—all highlighting the neutral and electrodynamical coupling of the equatorial ionosphere−thermosphere regions; an unusual lowering of mesospheric temperature during a moderate geomagnetic storm—highlighting a new space weather effect; diurnal tide showing a peak amplitude of 35m/s at 45km in zonal wind and a significantly lower amplitude (∼15m/s) in the meridional wind and also evidence of convective activity in the lower atmosphere influencing the tidal variability in the Mesosphere−Lower Thermosphere (MLT) region highlighting the vertical coupling of the atmospheric regions. The development of models for equatorial and low latitude ionosphere has been among the prime activities taken up under ‘Space Climate’. Two models have been developed towards this end: one based on Second Degree (SD) relationships of F region parameters to the mean sun spot number and the other a Multiple Regression Analysis (MRA) based model involving expressions relating F region parameters to that representing solar and geomagnetic activities. The two models, intended for long and short term predictions, have been found to represent the equatorial and low latitude ionosphere over Indian longitudes better than the commonly used International Reference Ionosphere (IRI). Under the theme of ‘Solar Influence on Atmospheric Climate’, a study has been made on the effects of solar variability on middle atmosphere using satellite data and model simulations, highlighting the significant differences between them.","Ionosphere,Magnetosphere,CAWSES,Stratosphere–troposphere,Solarwind,Mesosphere,Thermosphere,"
"a generic bayesian network for identification and assessment of objects in maritime surveillance","2012","Identification and assessment of objects are key capabilities of surveillance and information systems for maritime environments. Bayesian methodology provides established instruments for fusion of uncertain identification and assessment indications from various information sources. Particularly, Bayesian Networks are well qualified for modeling and inference in this application context. In order to standardize and simplify generation of Bayesian Identification Networks for new operational scenarios, a generic Bayesian Network for identification is proposed. This generic model defines adequate and necessary node types, well suited for modeling of identification and assessment tasks. In addition, the model provides a dependency structure by subgraphs, which simplifies provision of more complex cause-effect relations in Bayesian Identification Networks. Nevertheless, the generic model is flexible enough to cover various application scenarios with manifold operational demands. Closing, generation of a Bayesian smuggler detection Network for maritime surveillance in an exemplary littoral application scenario is presented.","surveillance,military radar,Bayesian Network,Bayesian identification networks,marine radar,generic Bayesian network,Generic Model,cause-effect relations,Identification,Marine vehicles,Taxonomy,belief networks,Bayesian methodology,Sea measurements,Affiliation & Threat Assessment,Uncertainty Modeling,target tracking,Bayesian smuggler detection,Bayesian methods,information systems,maritime surveillance,Context,Maritime Surveillance Systems,radar tracking,dependency structure,Uncertainty,Surveillance,"
"perturbation analysis for maritime applications","2012","Target detection of marine features is a major topic for the security and monitoring of coastlines. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) has been shown to be particularly useful because of its all-weather and night capability. In this paper a methodology based on the perturbation analysis developed by the authors is presented. The latter can be applied for detection of ships (non-marine targets) or classification of sea ice. The algorithm can be considered to be a negative filter focused on sea. Consequently, all the features which have a polarimetric behaviour different from the sea are detected and considered as targets. A complete validation with RADARSAT-2 full polarimetric data was performed in Portsmouth, UK. An accurate ground truth carried out during the acquisition, was accompanied, considering AIS GPS location and photographic evidences. Moreover, a map of the buoys helped locating this typology of targets. The results showed impressive accuracy, with detection of all the vessels seen during the ground truth.","Clutter,Classification algorithms,Vectors,Scattering,Marine vehicles,Detectors,Feature extraction,"
"smart anomaly detection for slocum underwater gliders with a variational autoencoder with long short-term memory networks","2022","Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are used extensively for monitoring the world’s oceans, taking measurements of oceanographic characteristics along the water column. Presently, there is no holistic anomaly detection system in operation and AUVs require experienced pilots to monitor the progress of missions. This results in a large operational overhead and reduces the number of AUVs that can be deployed simultaneously. This article proposes an online anomaly detection system for underwater gliders based on a data-driven approach. A novel Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Variational Autoencoder (VAE) has been developed and trained using field data from four deployments with healthy glider behaviour and then tested against four deployments where faults are present. The system is able to detect wing loss with a high degree of accuracy on gliders unseen during the models training, highlighting the generality of the model to different platforms. Additionally, the VAE method outperforms model-based solution for the detection of biofouling, proving its generality to different types of anomalies. The proposed smart anomaly detection will contribute to increasing the capacity of AUVs and reducing the dependence on support vessels and experienced pilots.","Underwater glider,Variational autoencoder,Marine autonomous system,Anomaly detection,Long short-term memory network,"
"model-based reconstruction of the ulysse-virginia oil spill, october–november 2018","2020","In response to the oil spill caused by the collision between the Ro-Ro ship Ulysse and CSL Virginia on 7th October 2018, the Lagrangian oil spill model MEDSLIK-II was utilized to predict spill transport and fate. Oil drift was forced by the high-resolution sea circulation provided by CMEMS and the ECMWF wind. Successive model runs were restarted 5 times with the distinct overflight- and satellite-derived observations provided by REMPEC and the Copernicus Sentinel-1 mission. The results were verified based on the ability to predict the first oil-beaching event that happened near Saint-Tropez (France) in the early afternoon of 16th October. Despite the general consistency among the runs, only the last initialization was able to forecast the oil beaching. Stochastic MEDSLIK-II simulations forced by the historical meteo-oceanographic datasets 2014–2018 revealed that the coastlines between Cap Lardier and the Gulf of Saint-Tropez were among the most impacted areas.","Oil spill emergency,MEDSLIK-II,REMPEC-MONGOOS collaboration,Deterministic and stochastic forecasts,Liguro-Provençal basin,CMEMS,"
"simulated seasonal oceanographic changes and their implication for the small pelagic fisheries in the java sea, indonesia","2023","Small pelagic fisheries in the Java Sea (JS) contributes to about 26.6% of the total marine fisheries resources, where their spatial-temporal variation is controlled by seasonal oceanographic changes. This study aims to investigate a relationship between seasonal reversal circulation and number of light-fishing vessels (VBD) dispersion that capture small pelagic fishes, using multi-datasets from a regional ocean circulation model, satellite-derived datasets, and pelagic fish landing datasets between 2010 and 2020. The model demonstrates that main axis of eastward (westward) monsoon current that brings warmer and fresher (cooler and saltier) water, confines much closer along the northern Java (southern Kalimantan) during the northwest (southeast) monsoon period. These changes are followed unprecedentedly by southward (northward) shift of VBD and high abundance of euryhaline (stenohaline) fish species. This new evidence implies that reversal monsoon current and surface component of Makassar Throughflow play a significant role on delineating potential small pelagic fishing ground and fish productions.","Small pelagic fishery,CROCO model,Satellite-derived dataset,Monsoon current,Java sea,"
"mesoscale modeling of smoke transport over the southeast asian maritime continent: interplay of sea breeze, trade wind, typhoon, and topography","2013","The online-coupled Weather Research and Forecasting model with Chemistry (WRFchem) is used to simulate the transport of smoke particles over the Southeast Asian Maritime Continent during September–October 2006. In this period, dry conditions associated with the moderate El Niño event caused the largest regional biomass burning outbreak since 1997. Smoke emission in WRFchem is specified according to the Fire Locating and Modeling of Burning Emissions (FLAMBE) database derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) fire products. The modeled smoke transport pathway is found to be consistent with the MODIS true color images and measured mass concentration of surface PM10 (particulate matter with diameter less than 10μm). The interplay of sea/land breezes, typhoons and storms over the subtropical western Pacific Ocean, trade winds, and topographic effects, can be clearly seen in the model simulation. The most severe smoke events in 1–5 October 2006 are found to be associated with the meteorological responses to the typhoon Xangsane (#18) over the western subtropical Pacific Ocean, which moved smoke from Sumatra eastward in the lower troposphere (below 700hPa), forming smoke layers mixed with and above the boundary layer clouds over Borneo. In contrast, the second largest week-long smoke transport event of 15–18 October 2006 was associated with the seasonal monsoonal transition period, during which smoke plumes were wide spread over the 5°S–5°N zone as a result of (a) the near surface divergence coupled with the 700hPa bifurcation of wind (flowing both to the west and to the east), and (b) the near-surface southeasterly and easterly winds along the equator transporting smoke from Borneo to Sumatra and Peninsular Malaysia. Analysis of data from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarisation (CALIOP) shows that smoke particles in October 2006 were primarily located within 3.5km above the surface. Smoke particles contributed roughly half of the total aerosol extinction retrieved by CALIOP. Results suggest that the smoke injection height in the model should be set lower than the 2–5km commonly used in transport simulations; smoke release at ~0.8km instead of 2km above surface gives a consistently better match to CALIOP observations. Numerical experiments further show that the Titiwangsa Mountains in Malaysia Peninsula and Tama Abu Mountains in Borneo have significant impacts on smoke transport and the surface air quality in the vicinity.","Sea breeze,Trade wind,Typhoon,Southeast Asian Maritime Continent,Smoke particles,"
"the amphi-atlantic distribution of the younger dryas paleoclimatic oscillation","1989","Interest in significant climatic fluctuations affecting large geographic areas but having a time range that is too brief to adduce the Milankovitch radiation cycles has focused on the Alleröd/Younger Dryas event, which is a well-established phenomenon of western Europe manifested by glacial and vegetational reconstructions. It is also shown by the foraminiferal evidence for shifts in the polar front in the North Atlantic. Recent pollen and lithostratigraphic investigations in the Maritime Provinces of eastern Canada and in the till plains of west-central Ohio on opposite sides of the late-glacial spruce forest indicate that the event also left a record in eastern North America. Experiments with an atmospheric general circulation model, with the temperature of North Atlantic surface waters depressed to full-glacial levels, lowered summer temperatures in ‘upwind’ periglacial eastern North America by 2°C — just as far inland as they did downwind in western Europe, where the paleoecological record of cooling is clear. A leading hypothesis for the cause for the Younger Dryas cooling appeals to the influx of tabular icebergs released from arctic ice shelves around the wasting Scandinavian and Siberian ice sheets during the Alleröd warming. The resulting cooling of the North Atlantic waters during the Younger Dryas could be facilitated or precipitated by the abrupt influx of glacial meltwater derived from almost the entire southern margin of the Laurentide ice sheet and emerging from the Gulf of St Lawrence, as brought about by a major shift in drainage direction from the Mississippi River to the St Lawrence River about 10.8 ka BP. A supplemental influx of fresh water may have come from the contemporaneous drainage of the Baltic Ice Lake. The diversion of Laurentide meltwater to the Atlantic was caused by retreat of an ice lobe in northwestern Ontario north of Minnesota, allowing the huge Glacial Lake Agassiz in Saskatchewan and Manitoba to drain into the Great Lakes and more than double the inflow of meltwaters in the North Atlantic, thereby diverting the Gulf Stream and permitting the influx of icebergs from the north to cool the ocean surface. Minor readvance of the ice lobe about 10 ka BP temporarily diverted the Lake Agassiz drainage to the south. With the final retreat of the ice, the drainage again went to the east, but by this time the ice sheets were much diminished and the regional climate had warmed enough so that the effects of the meltwater flux on the Gulf Stream were muted, and the ice sheets bordering the North Atlantic had retreated onto the land and no longer delivered enough icebergs to cool the surface waters. The Younger Dryas interval thus was terminated, and the warming manifested in the Alleröd was renewed.",""

Dagu, based on multi-source remote-sensing data of an aerial topographic map from 1966 and Landsat MSS, TM, ETM+, and OLI data from 1975 to 2017 for six sub-regions of the glacier covering 1.747Â±0.068 km2 at present. The results show that: first, the area of glacier exhibits an exponentially decreasing trend and retreated as much as 5.094 Â± 0.301 km2 during 1975-2017, with a shrinkage rate of 0.120 Â± 0.004 km2a-1. Second, the highest area shrinkage rates of glaciers are in the north, northwest, southwest, and south aspects. The largest retreat altitude of the glacier terminus is in the southwest aspect of region 2. Of which, the absolute retreat elevation is 303 m (from 4587 to 4890 m a.s.l.), at a mean rate of 7.2 m a-1. Third, the temperature has increased at a rate of 0.02754Â°C a-1 (R2 = 0.6132, p <; 0.05) by a total of 0.9Â°C (1961-2017), more higher than the region's average increase. However, there is no significant increasing precipitation trend. The warm-dry trend is aggravated and this is the main reason for the glacier recession. Finally, the accelerated retreat presents a severe challenge to the sustainability of the glaciers and glacier-oriented tourism.

"meteorological regimes modulating dust outbreaks in southwest asia: the role of pressure anomaly and inter-tropical convergence zone on the 1–3 july 2014 case","2015","The present work examines the characteristics (source regions, pathways, vertical profiles) as well as the meteorological conditions and the role of the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) during a dust event on 1–3 July 2014 over southwest (SW) Asia. NCEP/NCAR reanalysis, meteorological and satellite remote sensing (MODIS, Meteosat, CALIPSO) observations are utilized. The major dust storm (AOD550 up to 1.5–2.0) was generated in the southern Karakum desert in Turkmenistan as a result of intense north winds (Levar), due to enhanced pressure gradient between the Caspian Sea and Hindu Kush Mountains. The dust storm was vertically extended up to 5km over the arid terrain of SW Asia, as a consequence of the deep mixing layer and increased convection, while over northern Arabian Sea it was mixed with another dust plume coming from Arabia and marine aerosols due to strong monsoon winds within the boundary layer. The regional topography, variations in pressure, monsoon circulation and the position of the ITCZ play a decisive role on modulation of the wind field, dust-storm pathways and vertical distribution of dust. Enhanced knowledge of atmospheric circulation and processes responsible for dust export over SW Asia and Arabian Sea in linkage to the Levar wind and Indian summer monsoon is essential for improving dust forecasts and simulations over the region.","MSLP anomalies,SW Asia,ITCZ position,Dust storm,Karakum desert,Vertical dust distribution,"

"deployment strategies of mobile networks for internet-of-things in smart maritime ports","2022","It is estimated that 80% of world trade is transported via maritime logistic. The maritime trade networks can be seen as a graph with links and nodes. For an optimal network, the links representing the maritime routes must be short (with minimal cost) and secure. The nodes of the network represents the maritime ports, which are hub sending, receiving or switching the goods (in form of containers). The ports has passed from analog to digital ports to make use of IT tools to speed up the process, especially the administrative part. Nowadays, we talk about smart ports that uses data to further speed up the process administratively but also use a full automation to accelerate/optimize the processing of the goods/containers in terminals/quay. Terminal Operation System (TOS) is the main components in these operations. Therefore, the use of Internet-of-Thing (IoT) in TOS a decisive step towards smart ports.

"a prototype gui for unmanned air vehicle mission planning and execution","2014","This paper describes the development of a graphical user interface which provides unique mission control services to unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) operators. The software has two modes of operation, Planning Mode and Execution Mode. In Planning Mode an operator can readily simulate a desired flight plan to determine mission feasibility. Key features of this mode include integration of forecast weather data and interactive trajectory planning. Harsh North Atlantic weather can jeopardize a mission, so running a simulation with predicted wind conditions may greatly reduce the risk of a UAV loss. In Execution Mode the operator can deploy an autonomous vehicle, change the route “on the fly”, hold the aircraft over a point of interest, and return the UAV to home base whenever necessary. In both modes the predicted and actual weather conditions are the key to mission success. All weather data required for these functions is automatically downloaded via the internet. Operation of the software, including interactive trajectory planning, weather observation, mission planning and execution, is achieved through a user-friendly graphical user interface. Simulation results, flight trajectories, and weather data can be saved for further analysis. Comparing missions with and without weather information, it was determined that meteorological information can have a very significant impact on the mission success or failure. In a typical example mission discussed here, including forecast weather conditions increased the UAV's fuel consumption by 18% and mission time by 26%.","airborne surveillance,autonomous vehicles,maritime security,UAV mission planning,graphical user interface,UAV mission control,Unmanned aerial vehicle control,"
"observation needs for climate information, prediction and application: capabilities of existing and future observing systems","2010","The demand for long-term, sustained, reliable data and derived information on climate and its changes has never been greater than today. Long-term, well-calibrated, global observations of Essential Climate Variables (ECV) such as air temperature, precipitation, and sea-surface temperature are critical for defining the evolving state of the Earth's climate. Observing systems routinely collect much of the required data covering 49 ECVs, and significant progress has been made in coverage and technological capability over the two decades since the Second World Climate Conference. However, many key regions and climatic zones remain poorly observed, and gaps are widening in some cases. Supporting infrastructures for data stewardship and analysis are largely in place but require strengthening, while those for linking with socio-economic data and for providing user-oriented information services require more substantial development. The current capabilities are summarized, and further actions are identified to ensure that climate observation activities more fully meet the needs of science and society. The Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) was established in 1992 with the goal of providing comprehensive information on the total climate system, involving a multidisciplinary range of physical, chemical and biological observations of the atmosphere, oceans and land. GCOS is a “system of systems” that builds on the climate-relevant components of existing observing systems, and relies almost entirely upon national efforts to maintain and enhance those systems. Contributing systems include the World Meteorological Organization Global Observing System (GOS) for meteorology, its Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW) for atmospheric composition, the Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS), led by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC), and the Global Terrestrial Observing System (GTOS), led by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). GCOS itself is the climate observing system within the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) developed under the auspices of the Group on Earth Observations (GEO). The established in situ networks and space-based components must be sustained and operated with ongoing attention to data quality in accordance with the GCOS Climate Monitoring Principles; enhancements must be made for some types of observations; the exchange of observations and delivery of data and information to users must be ensured; reprocessing and reanalysis must be strengthened; and national and international coordination must be improved. The consequence of not meeting these requirements would be to seriously compromise the information on, and predictions of, climate variability and change. Detailed information on GCOS and the datasets that are produced as a result of GCOS observing activities can be found at the Global Observing Systems Information Center (GOSIC) at http://gosic.org.","GEOSS,climate observations,GEO,ECV,GAW,GTOS,GOOS,essential climate variables,GCOS,"

Nevertheless, for very long temporal series, it might be challenging to find a graphic visualization technique that allows representing a time range that is long enough to capture these seasonal events, while at the same time preserving short isolated events.

"spatiotemporal variability in bio-optical characteristics of the southwestern tropical indian ocean during boreal summer: biophysical influences","2022","The bio-optical characteristics of the surface ocean play a pivotal role in radiative transfer and photosynthetic carbon fixation. To examine spatiotemporal variability of bio-optical properties in the tropical Indian Ocean, a 10-day time-series comparative study was made at one fixed and 3 variable stations in the southwestern tropical Indian Ocean (SWTIO), and 4-stations in the Equatorial Indian Ocean (EIO) during June 2014. A total of 24 hyperspectral radiometer profiles were collected along with physicochemical parameters and phytoplankton pigments analysis. A negative sea level anomaly (SLA), higher precipitation, a more stable mixed layer, and higher buoyancy frequency (N2) were observed in SWTIO compared to EIO. The deep chlorophyll maxima (DCM) in SWTIO were characterised by deep biomass maxima (DBM) whereas in the EIO it was due to deep photoacclimation maxima (DAM). The photosynthetically available radiation (PAR) profiles were obtained by integrating downwelling irradiance from 400 to 700 nm suggesting that the SWTIO had a greater abundance of optically active substances (OAS) than the EIO. Surface chlorophyll a (Chl-a) was found to have significant relationships with phytoplankton absorption coefficient (aph(443)). Chl-a-specific phytoplankton absorption coefficients (a*ph(443)), total absorption coefficient (at(443)), and particulate backscattering (bbp(555)) were also related to Chl-a implying that the phytoplankton was in growth/active phase. The time-series variability of the phytoplankton and changes in the photosynthetic pigments (PSP) to photoprotective pigments (PPP) ratio at SWTIO suggested phytoplankton community shift during 5th to 7th days. Microplankton percent-abundances showed distinct linear relationships with Chl-a and bbp(555) implying that carbon fixation per unit Chl-a was higher in microplankton than in nano and picoplankton at SWTIO.

In addition, this would contribute valuable bio-optical data from an under-sampled geographical area.","Subsurface stratification,Light absorption,Tropical Indian Ocean,Particulate backscattering,Deep chlorophyll maxima,Phytoplankton pigments,"
"a method to extract the quaternion ship domain parameters from ais data","2022","The ship domain concept is of great interest for ship traffic modelling, risk assessment and intelligent collision avoidance. The paper proposes and applies a method to define AIS data-based empirical polygonal ship domains, based on traffic density matrices that are derived around each reference ship from an AIS dataset. A modified Quaternion Ship Domain allowing for different shapes for each quadrant is proposed, which results in a better fitting to the empirical domain. The parameters of Quaternion Ship Domains that best fit the empirical polygonal domains are determined for cargo ships and tankers of different lengths. Violations of the Quaternion Ship Domain are then used as an indicator of collision risk that is graphically represented in the study area, providing important information to support maritime traffic monitoring and control tasks.","Collision risk,Automatic identification system (AIS),Maritime traffic,Ship domain,"
"bio-inspired topology control mechanism for autonomous underwater vehicles used in maritime surveillance","2013","Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are increasingly used in maritime applications to acquire underwater information. With the guidance of intelligent topology control algorithms, AUVs adjust their positions efficiently such that they achieve desired underwater wireless sensor network (UWSN) configurations. A suitable application can be using AUVs in surveillance tasks, where they uniformly spread throughout a harbor entry or around a large civilian or military maritime vessel (e.g., an aircraft carrier) to detect any hostile or unexpected underwater intrusions. Since geographical characteristics are different for each port (shape, depth, etc.) and underwater currents constantly change, manually controlling underwater vehicles for these tasks is not feasible. In this paper, we present a particle swarm optimization (PSO) based topology control mechanism, called 3D-PSO, for AUVs operating in unknown 3D underwater spaces. 3D-PSO uses limited information collected from an AUV's neighborhood to make movement decisions over an unknown 3D space. Each AUV, using our 3D-PSO, is able to adjust its movement speed and direction to achieve a better location towards obtaining a uniform distribution. Simulation experiments demonstrate that, despite the significant variance of topographies of harbor entrances and the undersides of ships, 3D-PSO is an efficient tool to guide AUVs in creating a protection area for a harbor or a maritime vessel.","surveillance,topology control,bio-inspired topology control mechanism,harbor entrances,underwater information,civilian vessel,bio-inspired algorithms,particle swarm optimisation,3D-PSO,underwater wireless sensor networks,protection area,Network topology,wireless sensor networks,Topology,maritime surveillance,self-organizing networks,particle swarm optimization,autonomous underwater vehicles,Underwater vehicles,unknown 3D underwater spaces,harbor entry,surveillance tasks,military maritime vessel,Nickel,UWSN configurations,marine vehicles,intelligent topology control algorithms,underwater wireless sensor network configuration,AUVs,security,unexpected underwater intrusion detection,Mobile nodes,geographical characteristics,"
"seasonal oceanography from physics to micronekton in the south-west pacific","2015","Tuna catches represent a major economic and food source in the Pacific Ocean, yet are highly variable. This variability in tuna catches remains poorly explained. The relationships between the distributions of tuna and their forage (micronekton) have been mostly derived from model estimates. Observations of micronekton and other mid-trophic level organisms, and their link to regional oceanography, however are scarce and constitute an important gap in our knowledge and understanding of the dynamics of pelagic ecosystems. To fill this gap, we conducted two multidisciplinary cruises (Nectalis1 and Nectalis2) in the New Caledonian Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) at the southeastern edge the Coral Sea, in 2011 to characterize the oceanography of the region during the cool (August) and the hot (December) seasons. The physical and biological environments were described by hydrology, nutrients and phytoplankton size structure and biomass. Zooplankton biomass was estimated from net sampling and acoustics and micronecton was estimated from net sampling, the SEAPODYM ecosystem model, a dedicated echosounder and non-dedicated acoustics. Results demonstrated that New Caledonia is located in an oligotrophic area characterized by low nutrient and low primary production which is dominated by a high percentage of picoplankton cyanobacteria Prochlorococcus (>90%). The area exhibits a large-scale north–south temperature and salinity gradient. The northern area is influenced by the equatorial Warm Pool and the South Pacific Convergence Zone and is characterized by higher temperature, lower salinity, lower primary production and micronekton biomass. The southern area is influenced by the Tasman Sea and is characterized by cooler temperature, higher salinity, higher primary production and micronekton biomass. The dynamic oceanography and the complex topography create a myriad of mesoscale features including eddies, inducing patchy structures in the ecosystem. During the cool season, a tight coupling existed between the ocean dynamics and primary production, while there was a stronger decoupling during the hot season. There was little difference in the composition of mid-trophic level organisms (zooplankton and micronekton) between the two seasons. This may be due to different turn-over times and delays in the transmission of primary production to upper trophic levels. Examination of various sampling gears for zooplankton and micronekton showed that net biomass estimates and acoustic-derived estimates compared reasonably well. Estimates of micronekton from net observations and the SEAPODYM model were in the same range. The non-dedicated acoustics adequately reproduced trends observed in zooplankton from nets, but the acoustics could not differentiate between zooplankton and micronekton and absolute biomasses could not be calculated. Understanding the impact of mesoscale features on higher trophic levels will require further investigation and patchiness induced by eddies raises the question of how to best sample highly dynamic areas via sea experiments.","Primary production,Oceanographic surveys,Oligotrophic,Zooplankton,Acoustic data,Mesoscale eddies,Nekton,"
"natural and anthropogenic submarine morphologies revealed by high resolution acoustic data in the gulf of izmir, western turkey","2016","This study includes the interpretation of submarine morphological structures using the multibeam echo sounder bathymetry and CHIRP high resolution seismic in the Gulf of Izmir. The faults as the indicator of active tectonics, submarine channels, gas seeps, active and inactive pockmarks are the main natural morphological features in the gulf. Additionally, man-made (anthropogenic) structures like navigation channels, excavation debrises and ships wrecks are also observed. Geomorphological development of the gulf is controlled by the active faults in the Neotectonic period. Therefore, detection of active faults is very critical for the morphology of the gulf where many faults with different orientations have been interpreted on the seismic data. In the central-outer part of the gulf to the W NW, there are some normal faults trending in the N NW and S SE direction, and in the eastern and southern part of the gulf, E–W trending normal faults are evident in the seabed topography. The water depth increases from the eastern (inner) to the outer section of the gulf in the W NW direction. The N NE margin and the coastal area are very shallow (<25 m) because of the Quaternary deltaic sediment influx from the Gediz River. There are several biogenic, shallow gas accumulations in and around the delta of this river. In addition, many active and inactive pockmarks and gas seeps are also observed in the delta sediments and near the active faults as evidence of hydrocarbon generation and seepage.","Gulf of Izmir,Gediz Delta,Uzunada Fault Zone,Chirp,Multibeam echo sounder,"
"deep sea archaeological survey in the black sea – robotic documentation of 2,500 years of human seafaring","2019","Between 2015 and 2017 the Black Sea Maritime Archaeology Project (Black Sea MAP) discovered and recorded 65 shipwreck sites dating from the 4th Century BC to the 19th Century AD in the Bulgarian Exclusive Economical Zone (EEZ). Using state-of-the-art remotely operated vehicles to survey the seabed, the team captured more than 250,000 high-definition (HD) photographs; hundreds of hours of ultra high-definition (UHD) video together with acoustic bathymetric, laser, side-scan sonar and seismic data. The wrecks were located in depths from 40 to 2200 m – those shipwrecks in the deeper range presented extraordinary archaeological preservation due to the Black Sea's anoxic conditions. This paper will introduce the range of deep-sea optic and acoustic survey techniques to accurately record and create 3D and pseudo 4D models of the shipwrecks. It will focus on a Early 4th Century BC shipwreck demonstrating the project's survey strategy as well as adaptations developed in response to operational conditions; the implementation of deep sea robotics to generate georeferenced high-resolution photogrammetric models and the benefits this has as an on-site, as well as a post-cruise, interpretative tool. It demonstrates that in-theatre acquisition and processing of high-quality datasets is a working reality and has fundamental implications for management as well as the advantages that this brings to the archaeological research process: Firstly, in the creation of spatio-temporal models, i.e., 4D representations of a site pre and post archaeological excavation and secondly, in monitoring such wreck sites, and provides a viable non-intervention tool for the assessment of sites as part of a long-term management strategy. It also shows the value of well-funded collaboration between academia and industry and that deep water archaeology can and must be totally in accordance to the 2011 United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) convention.","Anoxic preservation,Photogrammetry,Shipwrecks,Black sea,Deep sea archaeology,Underwater robotics,"
"textual risk mining for maritime situational awareness","2014","In this paper, we propose an auxiliary Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) integrated system for maritime situational awareness (MSA) operations. We bring into account a new and influential asset - human intuition and perception - to the existing semi-automated decision support systems that mostly rely on numerical data collected by electronic sensors or cameras located either directly on the vessels or in the maritime command-and-control centers. For our project, we gathered weekly textual reports spanning twelve months from the United States Worldwide Threats to Shipping Reports repository that belongs to the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), We considered the maritime incident reports written by human operators as a valuable and accessible unstructured textual input source in which a span of text1 is called â€œriskâ€ if it expresses one of the following kinds of vessel incidents: fired, robbed, boarded, hijacked, attacked, chased, approached, kidnapped, boarding attempted, suspiciously approached or clashed with. Our approach benefits from probability distributions of some useful features annotated based on a list of lexicons that contain expressions denoting vessel types, risks types, risk associates, maritime geographical locations, dates and times. These distributions are captured and used to anchor the span of â€œrisksâ€ as they are described in the textual reports. After some preprocessing steps that include tokenization, named entity extraction and part-of-speech tagging, the textual risk mining system applies a variety of sequence classification algorithms, e.g., Conditional Random Fields, Conditional Markov Models and Hidden Markov Models in order to compare the risk classification performance. Empirical results show that our NLP/ML-based system can extract variable-length risk spans from the textual reports with about 90% correctness.","Markov processes,decision support systems,hidden Markov models,statistical distributions,tokenization,Risk management,attacked vessel incident,human intuition,Hidden Markov models,maritime geographical locations,conditional Markov models,maritime domain awareness,maritime command-and-control centers,Feature extraction,natural language processing,chased vessel incident,entity extraction,variable-length risk span extraction,maritime incident reports,maritime situational awareness,sequence classification algorithms,conditional random fields,robbed vessel incident,electronic sensors,United States worldwide threats to shipping reports repository,maritime situational awareness operation,fired vessel incident,marine safety,National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency,marine engineering,boarded vessel incident,feature annotation,machine learning,semiautomated decision support systems,cameras,part-of-speech tagging,risk management,NLP/ML-based system,Classification algorithms,probability distributions,risks types,risk classification performance,textual risk mining system,weekly textual reports,auxiliary ML,auxiliary machine learning,hijacked vessel incident,command and control systems,vessels,human perception,vessel types,MSA operation,kidnapped vessel incident,risk associates,risk detection,NGA,text analysis,boarding attempted vessel incident,approached vessel incident,Data mining,learning (artificial intelligence),sequence-based classifiers,"
"combining fm broadcast, accelerometers, ieee 892.15.4 wireless and gps to secure maritime containers worldwide","2010","There are approximately 50 million maritime style containers entering and leaving ports in North America every year and 500 millions worldwide [8]. The interiors of such containers are rarely inspected. With market globalization, a large amount of these containers enter North America on a daily basis. Such containers may include contraband or dangerous items that present an economic or security risk. Despite significant security improvements, only 3 to 5% of the maritime containers, that arrive in or transition through North America, go through physical inspection. Current container tracking technologies solely based on GPS consume high DC power, are costly, require line-of-sight with satellites and they are often too large to be covert. It is possible to overcome some of these limitations by combining GPS with a tracking system based on the FM broadcast signal. Digital FM broadcast is an alternative man-made signal that is ubiquitous, provides a geographically unique frequency spectrum and is about 100,000 as strong as a GPS satellite signal. The combination of GPS and FM, called 'Broadcast Assisted GPSâ„¢' allows the development of a low-cost, low-power and miniature FM-GPS receiver that can trace the path that a container has taken for less than 25$ per container. This paper presents the first results of highway trials (train and sea trials are to be conducted in 2010-2011) of such a low cost, covert, 'Broadcast Assisted GPS'based technology, called 'FM-RFID Tagâ„¢' that records the worldwide displacement of containers and displays the path undertaken by the container while in transit. As an added security benefit, the tag is also capable of detecting container intrusion, either door or side panel intrusion.","accelerometers,container tracking,container intrusion,FM broadcast,Monitoring,Global Positioning System,maritime containers,object tracking,Containers,Noise,IEEE 892.15.4 wireless,Maritime container intrusion sensor and Active RFID,sea ports,USA Councils,containers,GPS,Logic gates,radiofrequency identification,Receivers,Maritime container traceability,tracking system,"

"multiple ornsteinâ€“uhlenbeck processes for maritime traffic graph representation","2018","We propose an unsupervised procedure to automatically extract a graph-based model of commercial maritime traffic routes from historical Automatic Identification System (AIS) data. In the proposed representation, the main elements of maritime traffic patterns, such as maneuvering regions and sea-lanes, are represented, respectively, with graph vertices and edges. Vessel motion dynamics are defined by multiple Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes with different long-run mean parameters, which in our approach can be estimated with a change detection procedure based on Page's test, aimed to reveal the spatial points representative of velocity changes. A density-based clustering algorithm is then applied to aggregate the detected changes into groups of similar elements and reject outliers. To validate the proposed graph-based representation of the maritime traffic, two performance criteria are tested against a real-world trajectory dataset collected off the Iberian Coast and the English Channel. Results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach, which is suitable to be integrated at any level of a JDL system.","automatic identification system data,unsupervised learning,density-based clustering algorithm,Marine vehicles,maritime traffic routes,Mathematical model,JDL system,maritime traffic patterns,Pages Test OU Process,maneuvering regions,Stochastic processes,Electronic mail,Maritime Surveillance Awareness (MSA),DBSCAN,ships,vessel motion dynamics,marine engineering,spatial points representative,Page's test,Data models,unsupervised procedure,maritime traffic graph representation,pattern clustering,Artificial intelligence,English Channel,graph theory,Trajectory,multiple Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes,trajectory dataset,sea-lanes,long-run mean parameters,Iberian Coast,collision avoidance,AIS data,Graph-based Maritime Traffic Representation,change detection procedure,"
"colregs-compliant unmanned surface vehicles collision avoidance based on improved differential evolution algorithm","2024","Unmanned surface vessel (USV) has a wide range of applications in oceanographic research, resource development, environment detection, and security rescue due to its advantages of maneuverability, flexibility, fast response, and intelligence. The ability of USVs to autonomously and effectively avoid obstacles in highly dynamic and uncertain marine environments is a prerequisite for the successful completion of their tasks. Therefore, in this article, a USV collision avoidance based on International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea and the Collision Risk Model with the Improved Differential Evolution Algorithm (CRI-DE) has been considered. Based on the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGs) and common practices of seafarers, an improved ship collision risk model is proposed. Specifically, the model is innovatively combined with the differential evolution algorithm (DE) as a constraint condition to further realize path planning in complex situations. Moreover, chaotic multi-population parallel optimization, parameter adaptive adjustment strategy, and the construction of fitness function based on individual path points are added to the DE. In this way, the ability to escape from local optima and enrich population diversity can be guaranteed. Finally, experiments based on the proposed CRI-DE are conducted and the results indicate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method.","Collision risk model,Path planning,Multi-ship collision avoidance,Improved differential evolution algorithm,"
"reversals of the geomagnetic field, magnetostratigraphy, and relative magnitude of paleosecular variation in the phanerozoic","1976","The percentage of normal and reversed magnetization in land-based paleomagnetic studies of Phanerozoic rocks (0 to − 570 m.y.) have been compiled in order to determine the long-term variation in polarity bias of the geomagnetic field. Where possible the results are compared with the record from marine magnetic anomalies. Only rarely is there an even balance between normal and reversed polarity. During the past 350 m.y. two quiet intervals can be recognized when few reversals occurred, the Cretaceous (KN about − 81 to − 110 m.y.) and Permo-Carboniferous (PCR about − 227 to − 313 m.y.). Less firmly established are two other quiet intervals, one in the Jurassic (JN about − 145 to − 165 m.y.), and one in the Triassic (TRN about − 205 to − 220 m.y.). Between these quiet intervals there are disturbed intervals when reversals were comparatively frequent. From − 680 to − 350 m.y. the paleomagnetic record is inadequate to delineate a succession of quiet and disturbed intervals although one is probably present. Maximum entropy spectral analysis reveals three periodicities, a dominant one at about 300 m.y. and others, less well-defined, at 113 and 57 m.y. The variations in polarity bias are compared with the paleosecular variation, and it is shown that the magnitude of the paleosecular variation is greater in disturbed than in quiet intervals. This indicates that the magnitude of paleosecular variation and polarity bias are governed by variations in the balance between non-dipole and dipole components of the field, and that these variations probably had their origin in processes near the core—mantle interface. The correspondence between the dominant periods of 300 m.y. and plate tectonics is noted and a causal relationship suggested.",""
"reasoning with conceptual graphs and evidential networks for multi-entity maritime threat assessment","2022","Hybrid threat events are rare and cannot be modelled solely based on data. Instead they require a focus on discovery of emergent knowledge through information sharing across agencies and systems. That requires a shared conceptualisation of the problem and entities involved. It also means that uncertain and possibly conflicting information describing multiple entities and their relationships needs to be reasoned about. In this paper we discuss the relationship between uncertain conceptual graphs and belief functions. We put forward a fusion process which allows for taking advantage of evidential reasoning capabilities in a multi-entity context. We show how information from conceptual graphs can be fed into or represented as an evidential networks and how the inference results obtained from valuation networks can be used to generate a probability distribution on conceptual graphs. This is demonstrated on a multi-entity threat assessment situation where a hybrid threat is formed by several possibly cooperating vessels.","data mining,evidential reasoning capabilities,hybrid threat events,probability distribution,emergent knowledge discovery,valuation networks,Information sharing,belief networks,information fusion,evidential networks,Cost accounting,threat assessment,Evidence theory,multientity context,shared conceptualisation,Data models,Probability distribution,fusion process,conceptual graphs,situational awareness,belief functions,graph theory,uncertainty handling,multientity threat assessment situation,marine engineering computing,inference mechanisms,information sharing,probability,possibly cooperating vessels,Cognition,multientity maritime threat assessment,Threat assessment,hybrid threats,uncertain conceptual graphs,"
"cyber-physical framework for early integration of autonomous maritime capabilities","2013","The increasing demand for more self-governed assistance in maritime activities is leading ocean engineering research projects to combine diverse autonomous capabilities developed at geographically-dispersed locations. Availability of such capabilities as well as experiments in water is a critical issue that can seriously impact on the project milestones. The ability to perform verification and validation at an initial integration stage of maritime capabilities while they are still physically located at the partner's site can reduce significantly costs and risks. This paper proposes an early integration framework for autonomous capabilities of maritime vehicles by means of system and context simulation (including emulation of maritime vehicles and operational environment). This makes interaction between the computational and physical process become crucial as in cyber-physical systems. The framework proposed allows project patterns to pre-verify and pre-validate requirements before the system is physically integrated.

"climate reconstructions for the last glacial maximum from a simple cirque glacier in fiordland, new zealand","2022","Mountain glacier records offer important constraints on the timing and magnitude of climate variability during the last glacial cycle. Existing moraine chronologies from the central Southern Alps indicate maximum ice extent was achieved during marine isotope stages 3–4, followed by repeated advances of similar, but gradually declining extent during marine isotope stage 2, until onset of the glacial termination. Questions remain over the precise role of climate in driving these changes, as most existing moraine chronologies come from large, complex former valley glacier systems, where non-climatic influences such as changing bed topography and proglacial lake formation may have influenced glacier length changes. Here we address this problem via a new cosmogenic 10Be chronology and equilibrium line altitude reconstruction from a cirque glacier situated in Fiordland, New Zealand. Our chronology shows moraine deposition at 32 ± 11 ka, 18.7 ± 0.2 ka, 18.1 ± 0.1 ka, and c. 17.2 ± 0.3 ka. The simple geometry of the former glacier supports the role of climate in driving a net decline of regional ice volume during marine isotope stages 3–2. Close spacing and good preservation of the 19–17 ka moraines permits 2D glacier reconstruction which suggests the equilibrium line altitude remained depressed by c.1130 m (equivalent to 5.8 ± 0.6 °C colder than present) during this interval. Onset of warming after 17.2 ± 0.2 ka is consistent with climate proxy evidence for a sustained southward shift in the southern westerly winds, which may have promoted deglaciation via shifting ocean currents and promoting increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide.","Glaciation,Pleistocene,Quaternary,Geomorphology,Southern pacific,Degree day modelling,Cosmogenic isotopes,Equilibrium line altitude,Paleoclimatology,Glacial,"
"non-satellite broadband maritime communications for e-navigation services","2021","The development of broadband network access technologies available to users on land has triggered a rapid expansion of a diverse range of services provided by terrestrial networks. However, due to limitations of digital communication technologies in the off-shore area, the maritime ICT systems evolution so far has not followed that trend. Despite the e-navigation initiative defining the set of Maritime Services, the progress in the maritime ICT systems evolution has been slow. Only a few systems, including the VHF Data Exchange System (VDES), or the TRI-Media Telematic Oceanographic Network (TRITON) have been proposed to extend the basic set of services offered by classical radio-communication solutions. However, all those systems have significant limitations. The purpose of this paper is to introduce the netBaltic system designed as a fully heterogeneous system for modern maritime communications. Its unique feature is the capability to transparently use different communication technologies to efficiently support maritime ICT services, as well as openness for the incorporation of future communication technologies. The paper presents an overview of VDES, TRITON and netBaltic systems and analysis showing their expected strengths and weaknesses. The systems are then compared in simulated environments, illustrating real-world usage scenarios based on real maritime traffic information and performance measurements obtained during off-shore measurement campaigns. Results indicate that netBaltic seems to be the most versatile one and is capable of offering access to all services defined by International Maritime Organization, due to its ability to use different communication technologies simultaneously and functionality offered by its Delay Tolerant Networking component.","international maritime organization,Safety,wireless mesh networks,broadband network access technologies,wireless communication,Organizations,Communication systems,Wireless communication,VHF data exchange system,maritime ICT services,future communication technologies,maritime ICT systems evolution,different communication technologies,satellite communication,data communication,performance measurements,terrestrial networks,Broadband communication,digital communication technologies,TRI media telematic oceanographic network,modern maritime communications,netBaltic system,maritime services,maritime traffic information,telecommunication traffic,fully heterogeneous system,marine technology,classical radio communication solution,nonsatellite broadband maritime communications,broadband networks,computer networks,marine communication,e-navigation Services,network topology,mobile communication,Navigation,Task analysis,Information and communication technology,"

"analyzing congestion interdependencies of ports and container ship routes in the maritime network infrastructure","2018","Events, such as prolonged congestion in ports or unavailable ship routes in the maritime network, often initiate cascading congestions that block transportation and/or disrupt services over wide areas. Existing traffic flow analysis methods lack the ability to understand the cascading effects of delays in ship routes or how to reduce overall delays in greater maritime areas. Dependency risk graphs have been proposed as a tool for analyzing such cascading events using dependency chains. This paper proposes a risk-based interdependency analysis method capable to detect large-scale traffic congestions between interconnected ports and ship routes in the maritime network and provide solutions to improve flow. Presented dependency risk chains of ports along with graph theory help us analyze ship routes and detect ports that are affected most when other major ports are congested in the maritime network, detect the causes of bottlenecks, and provide valuable info in relieving delays across container ship routes. We apply the proposed method on historical container ship routing data provided by the MarineTraffic company that maintains a comprehensive maritime database worldwide for more than six million users monthly. This application-oriented, interdisciplinary effort culminated in a prototype tool is able to analyze the historical data for container ships in the entire global maritime network and detect congestion dependencies. The tool can be used to identify key shipping routes or ports that: 1) are prone to delays; 2) greatly affect the overall maritime network due to position, connections and risk of congestion; and/or 3) get affected the most by delays in previous route legs.","maritime database worldwide,cascading effects,Transportation,telecommunication network routing,graph,congestion interdependency analysis,centrality,vehicle routing,interconnected ports,transportation,Marine vehicles,sector,Delays,Mathematical model,Maritime,infrastructure,cascading,delay,Containers,ships,dependency risk chains,container,risk-based interdependency analysis method,dependency,flow,congestion,MarineTraffic company,impact,global maritime network infrastructure,sea ports,historical container ship routing data,containers,traffic flow analysis methods,graph theory,large-scale traffic congestion detection,risk,marine communication,Tools,route,Analytical models,port,"
"a merchant ship thermo-salinograph network in the pacific ocean","1996","The need for better knowledge of sea surface salinity (SSS) and sea surface temperature (SST) distribution in the tropical oceans was brought to light during the 10 years of the TOGA programme (1985–1994). In order to improve on the original “meteorological bucket” method of sampling, we developed a network of merchant ships among those operating regular routes through the tropical Pacific, and equipped them with thermo-salinographs. Accurate positioning of the ships was obtained using a satellite positioning system. High frequency sampling (every 15 s) and recording of the median values for every 5 min resulted in quite precise monitoring of the SST and SSS, and in a description of the salinity fronts along the routes followed by the ships. Using this equipment, we were able to detect the influence of local rainfall on salinity and temperature and the diurnal cycle of sea surface temperature. The accuracy of salinity measurements (0.02) was better than that of the old sampling technique by one order of magnitude. Temperature measurement by the thermo-salinograph was very stable but yielded results that are 0.2–0.3°C higher than sea surface temperature. To ensure reliability of data, the equipment was carefully checked every time the ships called at Noumea (i.e. every 2–3 months), and re-calibration every year or two is essential.",""
"eprd: exploiting prior knowledge for evidence-providing automatic rumor detection","2023","With the prevalence of social media platforms, rumors have been a serious social problem. Notably, existing rumor detection methods simply provide detection labels while ignoring their explanation. However, illustrating the reasons why a suspicious statement is a rumor is essential. To address this realistic scenario, we propose a novel Evidence-Providing Rumor Detection model called EPRD. EPRD incorporates a wide variety of information from both prior knowledge sources and current comments. It also learns bilaterally friendly representations for interpretable rumor detection. EPRD first retrieves evidence from prior knowledge sources and checks the relationship between the given statement and its evidence. Our model then constructs two heterogeneous graph objects to simulate the propagation layout of the current comments and evidence relationships. Finally, EPRD integrates the GraphSAGE component and attention mechanism to detect rumors. To the best of our knowledge, we propose the first model that incorporates prior knowledge to verify rumors and boost credibility. Experiments on two real-world Twitter datasets demonstrate that EPRD consistently exhibits the best rumor detection performance. Moreover, EPRD outperforms other baselines in the early rumor detection task.","Deep learning,Graph neural network,Rumor detection,Evidence,Natural language inference,"
"application scenarios of nautical ad-hoc network for maritime communications","2009","In terrestrial wireless communications, high data-rate transmission can be readily achieved by installing base stations on the ground. However, the same system may not be adapted to maritime communication due to the geographically restricted nature of the sea, and therefore, MF/HF modems, capable of long-distance transmission, with low data-rate are frequently employed in maritime communication. Maritime satellite communication through Inmarsat is conventionally used to compensate for the low data-rate transmission of MF/HF modems, but its high cost still remains as a main drawback. In order to enhance the transmission speed with a fairly low price, in general, a network whose architecture is similar to Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (VANET), that allows peer-to-peer communications without base stations, i.e., ad-hoc network, is crucial. Herein, we propose an ad-hoc network for nautical environment, which is named as Nautical Ad-hoc Network (NANET).

Our research relates to (1.) specific places connected to distant lands through sea travel featuring time-enabled layers of inter-connective place names in terms of self identification and social transformation, (2.) motivation for mariners, merchants, and monks to carry the dharma from South Asian harbors to other distant ports for religious, economic, and political exchange, and (3.) presenting notions of geographies as points and lines, not boundaries, as a tool for linking the significance of what seems to be unrelated elements, found to be connected in various ways leading to our better understanding of historical continuity, or discontinuity, at designated places. This work in turn becomes a contributing module to the ECAI Atlas of Maritime Buddhism.","naval engineering computing,merchant motivation,ECAI Atlas of Maritime Buddhism,Bali,cartography,maritime transportation systems,transportation,Sulawesi,historical Buddhism,human factors,dynamic GIS mapping of religious networks,maritime Buddhism,astronomical atlases,innovative methods of visualizing data,History,electronic cultural atlas initiative,Asia,marine systems,Indonesia,Austronesia Team,Cultural differences,Rivers,geographies,Monsoons,early historical navigation,Southeast Asia,Oceans,interconnectivity of ports,self identification,GIS mapping,geophysics computing,mariner motivation,ECAI,Southern Asia,geographic information systems,history,social transformation,Austronesian voyaging,Geographic information systems,"
"marine ecosystems’ responses to climatic and anthropogenic forcings in the mediterranean","2011","The semi-enclosed nature of the Mediterranean Sea, together with its smaller inertia due to the relative short residence time of its water masses, make it highly reactive to external forcings, in particular variations of water, energy and matter fluxes at the interfaces. This region, which has been identified as a “hotspot” for climate change, is therefore expected to experience environmental impacts that are considerably greater than those in many other places around the world. These natural pressures interact with the increasing demographic and economic developments occurring heterogeneously in the coastal zone, making the Mediterranean even more sensitive. This review paper aims to provide a review of the state of current functioning and responses of Mediterranean marine biogeochemical cycles and ecosystems with respect to key natural and anthropogenic drivers and to consider the ecosystems’ responses to likely changes in physical, chemical and socio-economical forcings induced by global change and by growing anthropogenic pressure at the regional scale. The current knowledge on and expected changes due to single forcing (hydrodynamics, solar radiation, temperature and acidification, chemical contaminants) and combined forcing (nutrient sources and stoichiometry, extreme events) affecting the biogeochemical fluxes and ecosystem functioning are explored. Expected changes in biodiversity resulting from the combined action of the different forcings are proposed. Finally, modeling capabilities and necessity for modeling are presented. A synthesis of our current knowledge of expected changes is proposed, highlighting relevant questions for the future of the Mediterranean ecosystems that are current research priorities for the scientific community. Finally, we discuss how these priorities can be approached by national and international multi-disciplinary research, which should be implemented on several levels, including observational studies and modeling at different temporal and spatial scales.",""
"national and international maritime situational awareness model examples and the effects of north stream pipelines sabotage","2023","While many countries and international organizations with maritime security interests and rights at sea have developed new security strategies or policies in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks in the United States of America, they have accordingly changed or created new maritime security strategies or doctrines with appropriate Maritime Situational Awareness (MSA) models as well. Maritime deterioration, climate change, cyberattacks, serious and organized crime, epidemics, and state-made threats are just some of the new and growing concerns affecting maritime security. The sabotage of the Nord Stream gas pipelines in the Baltic Sea has given maritime security doctrines and frameworks a new dimension. In this article, the current maritime security approaches and maritime domain or situational awareness (MDA/MSA) model examples of some countries and international organizations from different geographic regions and also the ones that are located in the maritime choke point regions where global maritime trade routes are located and also the effects of the Nord Stream Pipelines sabotages on these are examined in light of the new threats and risks. The principle result reached in this study is that countries and international structures should have a cross governmental maritime security strategy, or at least a doctrine, in order to guide their own maritime situational awareness models and identify information sharing architectures. The most important result of the sabotages on Nord Stream Pipelines for MSA models in this study is that the fastest and most cost-effective method for protecting critical infrastructure under the seas is the concept of systems such as Mothership controlled autonomous and unmanned underwater vehicles, extra large unmanned undersea vehicles and Synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) satellites.","Maritime situational awareness,Maritime security,Maritime domain awereness,Strategy,Sabotage,"
"information flow along the maritime transport chain - a simulation based approach to determine impacts of estimated time of arrival messages on the capacity utilization","2014","Various actors are involved in hinterland transportation of incoming rail containers along the maritime transport chain. To coordinate each actor's logistics processes, and therefore to improve utilization of existing transport capacity, the early provision of information, e.g. in form of estimated time of arrival (ETA), is inevitable. The objective of this paper is to determine impacts of these information flows on capacity utilization via a simulation based approach. To simulate the effect of ETA container from vessel to hinterland transport mode rail, a system dynamic simulation model is developed based on a case study about input containers at the port of Hamburg. As result the container output on rail is compared with and without ETA for different container input volumes. It will be shown; managing provision of information in supply chains - such as maritime transport chains - is a valuable approach for increasing existing utilization.","time-of-arrival estimation,supply chain management,Transportation,capacity utilization,information flow,container input volume,hinterland transportation,transportation,Cranes,system dynamic simulation model,marine systems,logistics,Containers,Bibliographies,input container,estimated time of arrival message,transport capacity,simulation based approach,supply chain,Stacking,Adaptation models,containerisation,hinterland transport mode rail,Rails,ETA container,rail container,maritime transport chain,logistics process,"
"maritime target detection based on radar graph data and graph convolutional network","2022","Due to the complex sea clutter environment and target features, the conventional statistical theory-based methods cannot achieve high performance in maritime target detection tasks. Conventional deep learning, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs)-based target detection methods process each signal sample independently, and the temporal-spatial domain correlation information is seldom used. To achieve full utilization of information contained in radar signals and improve the detection performance, a graph convolutional network (GCN) is considered, which has shown great advantages in graph data processing and has been applied in the field of signal processing. This letter proposed a maritime target detection method based on radar signal graph data and graph convolution. Graph structure data is applied to define the detection units and to represent the temporal and spatial information of detection units. The target detection of the signal corresponding to the nodes is conducted via GCN. Experimental results show that the proposed approach can effectively detect marine targets when the signal-to-noise ratio is above âˆ’5 dB and can effectively suppress false alarms in the pure clutter area, which is not adjacent to targets. Compared with the popular used CNN method, e.g., LeNet, the proposed method can achieve higher detection probability with the same given false alarm rate.","marine radar,deep learning (artificial intelligence),signal processing,radar detection,graph data processing,radar clutter,graph convolutional network,conventional statistical theory-based methods,radar signals,Feature extraction,sea clutter,signal sampling,Manganese,deep learning,radar target detection,temporal-spatial domain correlation information,object detection,radar signal graph data,convolutional neural networks-based target detection methods,Radar,graph theory,Convolution,radar signal processing,convolutional neural nets,graph structure data,Graph convolutional network (GCN),higher detection probability,graph data,temporal information,CNN method,marine targets,maritime target detection method,Clutter,Object detection,signal-to-noise ratio,radar graph data,maritime target,Radar detection,spatial information,"
"adaptive detection of spatial point event outliers using multilevel constrained delaunay triangulation","2016","Spatial outlier detection is a research hot spot in the field of spatial data mining. Because of the lack of specific research on spatial point events, this study presents an adaptive approach for spatial point events outlier detection (SPEOD) using multilevel constrained Delaunay triangulation. First, the spatial proximity relationships between spatial point events are roughly captured by Delaunay triangulation. Then, three-level constraints are described and used to refine spatial proximity relationships with the consideration of statistical characteristics. Finally, those spatial point events connected by remaining edges are gathered to form a series of subgraphs. Those subgraphs containing very few point events are regarded as spatial outliers. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world spatial data sets are used to show that the proposed SPEOD algorithm can detect various types of spatial point event outliers with high efficiency. Moreover, there is no need to input any parameter in SPEOD.","Spatial point events,Multilevel constrained Delaunay triangulation,Spatial outliers,"
"traffic pattern detection using the hough transformation for anomaly detection to improve maritime domain awareness","2014","Techniques for extracting traffic patterns from ship position data to generate atlases of expected ocean travel are developed in this paper. An archive of historical data is used to develop a traffic density grid. The Hough transformation is used to extract linear patterns of elevated density from the traffic density grid, which can be considered the â€œhighwaysâ€ of the oceans. These highways collectively create an atlas that is used to define geographical regions of expected ship locations. The atlas generation techniques are demonstrated using automated information system (AIS) ship position data to detect highways in both open-ocean and coastal areas. Additionally, the atlas generation techniques are used to explore variability in ship traffic as a result of extreme weather. The development of an automatic atlas generation technique that can be used to develop a definition of normal maritime behavior is a significant result of this research.","Traffic control,historical data archive,highway detection,Pattern Extraction,geographical regions,automatic atlas generation technique,cartography,anomaly detection,Marine vehicles,maritime domain awareness,traffic density grid,geography,AIS ship position data,Meteorology,Hough transformation,normal maritime behavior,ships,Maritime Domain Awareness,marine engineering,Hough Transformation,Hough transforms,Oceans,traffic information systems,traffic pattern extraction,coastal area,automated information system ship position data,linear pattern extraction,traffic pattern detection,Road transportation,Market research,ship traffic,image processing,Data mining,ocean travel,open-ocean area,Automated Information System,"
"accurate prediction system for maritime navigation route of rescue ship","2022","Due to the lack of pheromone, the basic ant colony algorithm applied in the route prediction system leads to low route prediction accuracy under a certain number of iterations.

"cyber-maritime cycle: autonomy of marine robots for ocean sensing","2016","Marine robots are being increasingly deployed in environmental sensing and ocean observation applications. The key challenges in mobile ocean sensing are to design and control the motion of the robots to collect Lagrangian data over a large spatial domain, and then convert these Lagrangian data streams into Eulerian spatial-temporal maps for scientific and operational benefits. This monograph introduces cyber maritime cycle as a collection of feedback loops where the flow of data is regulated by functional blocks of autonomy. As a new development, the split between the data-driven cycle and the geo-scientific modeling cycle allows the separation of data streams with different time and spatial scales. This separation allows the conversion between Lagrangian and Eulerian data representations to happen more frequently for navigation of marine robots. This monograph introduces the overall systems architecture and patterns for data streams that enables autonomy for marine robots towards environmental sensing applications. It is an ideal reference for researchers, students or practitioners already doing research in this field, or planning to do so.",""
"spatial relationship between phytophthora ramorum and roads or streams in oregon tanoak forests","2014","The pathogen, Phytophthora ramorum, causal agent of sudden oak death (SOD) of oaks and tanoaks, continues to expand its range within Oregon despite an effort to eradicate it from native forests. With its early detection and prompt removal of infected hosts, the Oregon SOD eradication program has produced a landscape distribution of disease resulting predominantly from the long distance (100m to 4km) dispersal of inoculum between sites. Using a regionally restricted randomization test reflecting the south to north intensification of the SOD epidemic in Oregon, we assessed if the movement of P. ramorum between sites was spatially dependant upon roads and streams, topographic features associated with the landscape-scale movement of soil and water borne inoculum of related Phytophthora spp. Dissimilar to other forest Phytophthora spp. we found no association between SOD sites and the road network. We did, however, determine that SOD sites are occurring closer to streams than would be expected by chance, especially in regions with microclimates less conducive to establishment. Environmental conditions and/or dispersal mechanisms associated with streams may contribute to the distribution of SOD in Oregon tanoak forests. Monitoring and management should therefore concentrate on susceptible forests in close proximity to streams, especially in stands further inland from a coastal climate.","Sudden oak death,Spatial spread,Invasive pathogen,Forest pathology,Restricted randomization,"
"eeg-based maritime object detection for iot-driven surveillance systems in smart ocean","2020","Automated maritime object detection is a significant research challenge in intelligent marine surveillance systems for the Internet of Things (IoT) and smart ocean applications. In particular, ship detection is recognized as one of the core research issues of these IoT-driven intelligent marine surveillance systems. Traditional methods based on machine learning have made some achievements in detection tasks for specific objects. However, the ship objects are relatively small, and they are usually not accurately detected. In this article, we propose an electroencephalography (EEG)-based maritime object detection algorithm for IoT-driven surveillance systems in the smart ocean. For this purpose, we conduct experiments to record the EEG signals of subjects when they are watching the maritime image scenes. With the feature analysis of EEG signals, the event-related potential (ERP) components associated with detecting objects are induced, such as the  $P3$  and  $N2$  components. Employing classification based on linear discriminant analysis (LDA), the area under curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) is used to evaluate the detection accuracy. We use this novel method to determine and identify essential objects and areas from IoT devices, such as digital camera imaging sensors. Our proposed method can not only help to detect small objects accurately using fewer samples but can also be used to reduce the data volume needed to be stored and transmitted in IoT-driven marine surveillance systems.","medical signal processing,surveillance,Electroencephalography,Electroencephalography (EEG),Internet of Things (IoT),ship detection,Internet of Things,Marine vehicles,maritime image scenes,Feature extraction,smart ocean applications,IoT-driven intelligent marine surveillance systems,maritime object detection,automated maritime object detection,ships,electroencephalography-based maritime object detection algorithm,Oceans,object detection,feature extraction,intelligent surveillance systems,IoT-driven marine surveillance systems,IoT devices,image sensors,smart ocean,Object detection,Surveillance,learning (artificial intelligence),electroencephalography,"

As a result, we experiment with pre-trained CNNs based on the Inception and ResNet architectures to perform ship classification.

"late quaternary hydroclimatology of a hyper-arid andean watershed: climate change, floods, and hydrologic responses to the el niño-southern oscillation in the atacama desert","2008","Although certain characteristics of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) are well known on contemporary timescales, less is known about the magnitude–frequency relationships of this atmospheric phenomenon on longer timescales or its relationship to widespread flooding, especially in its core zone along the sub-tropical Andes where La Niña or El Niño episodes control regional hydroclimatology. Using a combination of stratigraphic evidence, geochronologic dating (14C and OSL), stable isotope analyses, and water geochemistry along the Rio Moquegua in the northern fringes of the Atacama Desert, we assemble a paleoflood chronology for mainstem and tributary sections for the past ca. 20 ka and ascertain the variation in ENSO frequency and magnitude. Because of the inherent watershed structure and regional hydroclimatology, mid-valley tributaries of the Rio Moquegua only flood during El Niño episodes and thus provide an important proxy of extreme El Niños while mainstem stratigraphy records both La Niña and El Niño episodes. El Niño floods appear to have been pronounced during the Late Pleistocene and up to at least the Younger Dryas (~12,000 cal yr BP) while stratigraphic evidence of large El Niño floods is lacking in tributary systems during the Mid-Holocene. Flood stratigraphy in a ~2 ka 7 m high terrace along the mainstem indicates an increased frequency and magnitude of large floods between ca. 700 and 1610 AD as compared to the period from ca. 160 BCE to 700 AD with “mega-Niños” occurring ca. 1330 AD and ca. 1650 AD. Water geochemistry and radiocarbon dating indicate that at least two major aquifers exist, with wells and springs in the mid-valley dating to 710 and 3100 14C yr BP, respectively, while water from a spring in the headwaters dates to 10,320 14C yr BP. This range in dates suggests that groundwater flow in the mid-valley is neither fossil water nor exclusively recharged from local precipitation while the older date for headwater sections suggests a more fossil groundwater source and lack of contemporary recharge. The 18O similarity between groundwater in the mid-valley and the regional meteoric water line (MWL) suggests a Pacific moisture source and the role of El Niño precipitation in recharging local aquifers. Thus, El Niños and Pacific-sourced moisture are an important component of the regional hydroclimatology and the variation in ENSO frequency and intensity has significant social and hydrologic repercussions in these hyper-arid settings.","Andes,Floods,El Niño,Tiwanaku,Isotopes,Climate change,"

The probabilistic belief of the ship's intention is modeled and quantified using probabilistic tools such as dynamic Bayesian networks.

"many-objective maritime path planning for dynamic and uncertain environments","2021","Weather-impacted asset routing is a complex problem, involving nonlinear, non-convex costs due to spatiotemporally varying uncertainty of weather parameters over a finite time horizon. To this end, we have augmented a previously published tool for multiobjective planning and asset routing, termed TMPLAR, with a new approximate dynamic programming-based Pareto optimization (NAPO) algorithm. TMPLAR is a mixed-initiative tool to solve the asset routing problem in dynamic and uncertain environments. It is built upon multi-objective dynamic programming algorithms to route assets in a timely fashion, while considering objectives, such as fuel efficiency, voyage time, distance, and adherence to real world constraints (asset vehicle limits, navigator-specified deadlines, etc.). The asset routing problem is exacerbated by the need to address multiple conflicting objectives, spatial and temporal uncertainty associated with the weather and multiple constraints on asset operation. The NAPO algorithm optimizes weather-based objectives in a reasonable amount of time, optimizing arrival and departure times at waypoints, asset speed and bearing. The key algorithmic contribution is a fast approximate method for substantially containing the computational complexity by generating the Pareto-front of the multi-objective shortest path problem for networks with stochastic non-convex edge costs, utilizing approximate dynamic programming and clustering techniques. The proposed algorithm is validated and we compare its performance with the new approach to multi-objective A* (NAMOA*).","key algorithmic contribution,published tool,Clustering algorithms,termed TMPLAR,vehicle routing,voyage time,Approximation algorithms,weather-based objectives,multiobjective shortest path problem,route assets,multiobjective planning,weather parameters,asset vehicle limits,asset operation,multiple conflicting objectives,asset routing problem,mixed-initiative tool,Aerodynamics,ships,complex problem,nonconvex costs,dynamic programming,asset speed,uncertain environments,graph theory,temporal uncertainty,NAPO algorithm,finite time horizon,path planning,considering objectives,search problems,Pareto optimisation,Routing,departure times,Uncertainty,computational complexity,spatial uncertainty,approximate dynamic programming-based Pareto optimization algorithm,weather-impacted asset routing,clustering techniques,nonconvex edge costs,Tools,approximation theory,Heuristic algorithms,dynamic environments,multiobjective dynamic programming algorithms,objective maritime path planning,"

"initiation of a severe thunderstorm over the mediterranean sea","2011","The Mediterranean basin is regularly affected by severe weather associated with deep convection. Although convective systems are usually linked to coastal orography, some severe thunderstorms develop and mature over the sea. A recent example is the severe thunderstorm that affected the island of Mallorca in the afternoon of 4 October 2007. The storm formed early in the morning offshore of Murcia, and steadily became organized into a squall line. Arriving in Palma city, this squall line produced severe gusts, heavy rain and several tornadoes. The initiation and evolution of convection in these kinds of maritime events depend on both synoptic and mesoscale features. Representing such interactions is a challenge for numerical weather prediction. The aim of this study is to determine the prominent factors involved in the initiation and evolution of the damaging squall line, by means of high resolution numerical experiments. We also focus on squall line mesovortices to explain the potential for tornado development and the role of Mallorcan orography on their evolution. Simulations performed with the mesoscale model Méso-NH allowed relevant mechanisms for initiation and development of the strong squall line to be identified. The squall line initiates in an area with conditional instability, characterized by a cut-off and a southerly jet aloft and by moist, warm air at low-levels along a front. In addition, the area of low-level convergence offshore of Murcia, associated with the front and enhanced by a low downstream of the Atlas range, was shown to be crucial during the early stage of the convective system. The dry layer in the mid-troposphere and the strong sheared environment provide elements for understanding the development of such a damaging squall line. Moreover, a very high resolution experiment (600m mesh) gave a very realistic representation of the squall line, including mesovortices ahead of the gust front, which confirmed the potential of this strong convective system for the genesis of small-scale vortices that may precede tornado development. A sensitivity experiment pointed out the prominent role of Mallorcan orography in straightening mesovortices approaching Palma city, and provided interesting elements for the understanding of the localization of tornadoes that occurred on 4 October 2007.","Bow echo,Mesovortices,Mediterranean convection,"

"a fast sar image position algorithm for maritime target location","2016","In order to find the maritime targets location in SAR image accurately, a fast R-D algorithm is introduced in this paper and it can solve targets location problems which are in the sea area. The real latitude and longitude coordinates measure system and geographical coordinates are built up for SAR image, then the targets located in the sea can be point out. First, based on information in SAR satellite data headers the Doppler center frequency coefficients can be calculated. Then the parameters are carried in the R-D pattern for calculate four vertex coordinates of SAR image. Generally the solution of R-D pattern is an iterative process, here a fast algorithm is proposed which combined with slope distance, Doppler parameters and earth model to reduce variables, then and the position of SAR is calculated and the latitude and longitude coordinates of target is also obtained. Second, the SAR image geocoding can be made up and the target in SAR image over sea can be found out. Finally, compare these results with AIS data, the accuracy of location is analyzed.

On this latter occasion it was decided to collect contributions of scientists, engineers and managers involved in the worldwide altimetry community to depict the state of altimetry and propose recommendations for the altimetry of the future. This paper summarizes contributions and recommendations that were collected and provides guidance for future mission design, research activities, and sustainable operational radar altimetry data exploitation. Recommendations provided are fundamental for optimizing further scientific and operational advances of oceanographic observations by altimetry, including requirements for spatial and temporal resolution of altimetric measurements, their accuracy and continuity. There are also new challenges and new openings mentioned in the paper that are particularly crucial for observations at higher latitudes, for coastal oceanography, for cryospheric studies and for hydrology. The paper starts with a general introduction followed by a section on Earth System Science including Ocean Dynamics, Sea Level, the Coastal Ocean, Hydrology, the Cryosphere and Polar Oceans and the “Green” Ocean, extending the frontier from biogeochemistry to marine ecology. Applications are described in a subsequent section, which covers Operational Oceanography, Weather, Hurricane Wave and Wind Forecasting, Climate projection. Instruments’ development and satellite missions’ evolutions are described in a fourth section. A fifth section covers the key observations that altimeters provide and their potential complements, from other Earth observation measurements to in situ data.

The conclusions of the synthesis include: 1) China has emerged as a dominant force in the region in producing scientific literature in coastal oceanography, although the area of publications has shifted from its traditional fields such as physical oceanography; 2) there has been an increasing number of publications with cross-disciplinary themes between physical oceanography and other fields of the biological, chemical, and geological disciplines, but vigorous and systematic funding mechanisms are still lacking to ensure the viability of large scale multi-disciplinary teams and projects in order to support trans-disciplinary research and newly emerging fields; 3) coastal oceanography is responding to new challenges, with many papers studying the impacts of human activities on marine environment and ecology, but so far very few studying management and conservation strategies or offering policy solutions.","Yellow Sea and East China Sea,Japan,conservation,Taiwan,Korea,physical and biogeochemical processes,management,coastal oceanography,China,"

"incorporating discrete unmanned maritime system data collections into ncei synthesized data products","2020","In recent years, Unmanned Maritime Systems (UMS) have become widely used in hydrographic surveys and oceanographic studies, especially in coastal regions. NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) has received an increased amount of data collected by UMS in the past 10 years. A variety of different types of data are typically collected simultaneously by UMS, which raises questions about the best practices for UMS data management. In this manuscript, we discuss enhancing the value of UMS data through integration into NCEI synthesized products. These products range from data-type specific databases like the Surface Underway Marine Database, and the World Ocean Database to analyses (value-added) products such as climatological mean fields and ocean time series of variables such as ocean heat and oxygen content. Data from Saildrones and Wave Glider missions demonstrate how data collected by Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USV) are integrated into the Surface Underway Marine Database. The integration of data from Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUV) systems - such as gliders - into the World Ocean Database is also described. Data management procedures and quality controls are discussed. The application of standardized methods adds long-term value to the original UMS, and improves the quality and reliability of the synthesized products. NCEI stewardship practices maximize NOAA's investment in environmental research, converting scientific insights into dynamic, usable information that inform strategy and decision making in government, academia, and the private sector.","NCEI stewardship practices,Vehicle dynamics,ocean heat,remotely operated vehicles,Surface waves,Essential Oceanographic Variables,Unmanned Underwater Vehicle,Data Synthesis,Unmanned underwater vehicles,underwater vehicles,climatological mean fields,World Ocean Database,oceanographic equipment,Glider,marine engineering,Databases,Unmanned Underwater Vehicles systems,autonomous underwater vehicles,Sea surface,NCEI synthesized products,US Government agencies,data-type specific databases,data management procedures,Time series analysis,climatology,Saildrone,oceanographic regions,Unmanned Maritime Systems,NOAA investment,NOAA NCEI,Unmanned Surface Vehicle,unmanned surface vehicles,Data Management,discrete UMS data collections,marine vehicles,oxygen content,National Centers for Environmental Information,surface underway marine database,UMS data management,oceanographic techniques,"

"lagrangian analysis of multi-satellite data in support of open ocean marine protected area design","2017","Compared to ecosystem conservation in territorial seas, protecting the open ocean has peculiar geopolitical, economic and scientific challenges. One of the major obstacle is defining the boundary of an open ocean Marine Protected Area (MPA). In contrast to coastal ecosystems, which are mostly constrained by topographic structures fixed in time, the life of marine organisms in the open ocean is entrained by fluid dynamical structures like eddies and fronts, whose lifetime occurs on ecologically-relevant timescales. The position of these highly dynamical structures can vary interannually by hundreds of km, and so too will regions identified as ecologically relevant such as the foraging areas of marine predators. Thus, the expected foraging locations suggested from tracking data cannot be directly extrapolated beyond the year in which the data were collected. Here we explore the potential of Lagrangian methods applied to multisatellite data as a support tool for a MPA proposal by focusing on the Crozet archipelago oceanic area (Indian Sector of the Southern Ocean). By combining remote sensing with biologging information from a key marine top predator (Eudyptes chrysolophus, or Macaroni penguin) of the Southern Ocean foodweb, we identify a highly dynamic branch of the Subantarctic front as a foraging hotspot. By tracking this feature in historical satellite data (1993–2012) we are able to extrapolate the position of this foraging ground beyond the years in which tracking data are available and study its spatial variability.",""
"maritime mathematics course renovation in maritime training programs in new zealand","2022","Maritime Mathematics is a fundamental part of Maritime Training Programs, as it is deeply involved in maritime affairs, e.g. ship stability and navigation are the problems that can be solved by computing using mathematics. Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping (STCW) requires the trainees to be assessed and deemed competent in maritime mathematics, a New Zealand Qualifications Authority (NZQA) Level 3 course with 15 credits is to assess for competency in maritime mathematics in the following six topics: Algebra, Mensuration, Graphs, Calculus, Geometry, Trigonometry. Until end of 2021, the program specific regulations allow open entry for domestic students and no mathematics access criteria for international students. This means that the students start their maritime mathematics class at varying levels of proficiency. However, all learning outcomes in six maritime mathematics topics must be achieved for a student to be deemed competent by completion of their training programs. A study is conducted to identify the gaps caused by the open entry policy, based on observation of interaction of teaching and learning with results in course final exam, to analyze the weakness of the current teaching contents and start Maritime Mathematics course renovation in maritime training programs in New Zealand. This study has contributions to Programme Change Application, which has been approved by NZQA at end of 2021, that Applicants must meet the following criteria for admission into the programme Applicants with no seagoing experience: 14 credits in either Mathematics (calculus, algebra or equivalent) and/or Physics. As the programme Applicants with seagoing experience still have no mathematics access criteria, this study has led to the production of a new Industry-oriented teaching strategy to the course development in 2022. And a formative test at the time of student enrolment to identify this group of students. thus, a pre-course session will be offered to the group of students who are lack of Mathematics foundation.

"maritime communications and remote voyage monitoring","2020","For ships at sea, communicating with other ships or even to land-based sites has always been a very difficult task. Around 1900, the installation of wireless communication equipment on ships began. This form of communication initially used radio waves in the MF (Medium Frequency) band. Ever since it has been undergoing various technological innovations. At present, in addition to typical terrestrial communication in the VHF band, satellite communication using microwaves is also possible. Further, these forms of data communication have replaced the telegraph and telephone. Even now, however, the speed and capacity of data communication are significantly less than that of the land-based data communication network. After reviewing the situation of maritime communication, this paper studies the data communication for autonomous navigation of ships that is currently in demand focusing on remote monitoring. It appears that few instances of obtaining verification through detailed on-board data related to real-time communication have previously been possible. That being the case, the authors posit that it is worthwhile to demonstrate the feasibility of obtaining relevant verification based on actual data via a university training vessel equipped with the latest data collection system - a system that is relatively unavailable even on new, large-scale merchant ships. Particularly for digital data, maritime communication remains mainly via relatively slow and expensive narrowband satellite transmission. Though speedier and more efficient data transfer is possible through the use of simple data compression, the costs for this mode are currently prohibitively high. It is posited that economical, speedy, and efficient data transfer via data compression will increasingly become economically available for more ships in the future.","Digital Ship,marine navigation,terrestrial communication,VHF band,latest data collection system,satellite communication,medium frequency band,data communication,ships,Remote Monitoring,Maritime Communication,economical data transfer,data compression,wireless communication equipment,history,Data Communication,marine communication,remote voyage monitoring,autonomous navigation,maritime communications,"
"producing marine geophysical archive files from raw underway data","2019","Preserving costly marine geophysical trackline data is of paramount importance but variability in priorities, funding, personnel, and technology impact our data archival capacity. We have addressed one crucial facet of this dilemma by devising an open source approach to merge and reduce underway geophysical data and to generate marine geophysical archive files using common command line programs along with the Generic Mapping Tools and its mgd77 supplement. Archive files generated using this approach retain full precision and may be converted automatically to MGD77T, MGD77+, as well as MGD77 formats. We successfully applied the approach to 340 geophysical data sets acquired by R/V Kilo Moana from 2002 to 2018 and in the near term we plan to submit the non-proprietary archive files to the National Centers for Environmental Information’s trackline geophysics archive. We encourage international oceanographic communities to explore our methodology as a larger user-base will strengthen the software and the procedures.","Data structures,Algorithms,Data processing,Marine geophysical trackline data,Data assimilation,MGD77,"

"observing and understanding the southeast asian aerosol system by remote sensing: an initial review and analysis for the seven southeast asian studies (7seas) program","2013","Southeast Asia (SEA) hosts one of the most complex aerosol systems in the world, with convoluted meteorological scales, sharp geographic and socioeconomic features, high biological productivity, mixtures of a wide range of atmospheric pollutants, and likely a significant susceptibility to global climate change. This physical complexity of SEA is coupled with one of the world's most challenging environments for both in situ and remote sensing observation. The 7-Southeast Asian Studies (7SEAS) program was formed to facilitate interdisciplinary research into the integrated SEA aerosol environment via grass roots style collaboration. In support of the early 7SEAS program and the affiliated Southeast Asia Composition, Cloud, Climate Coupling Regional Study (SEAC4RS), this review was created to outline the network of connections linking aerosol particles in SEA with meteorology, climate and the total earth system. In this review, we focus on and repeatedly link back to our primary data source: satellite aerosol remote sensing and associated observability issues. We begin with a brief rationale for the program, outlining key aerosol impacts and, comparing their magnitudes to the relative uncertainty of observations. We then discuss aspects of SEA's physical, socio-economic and biological geography relevant to meteorology and observability issues associated with clouds and precipitation. We show that not only does SEA pose significant observability challenges for aerosol particles, but for clouds and precipitation as well. With the fundamentals of the environment outlined, we explore SEA's most studied aerosol issue: biomass burning. We summarize research on bulk aerosol properties for SEA, including a short synopsis of recent AERONET observations. We describe long range transport patterns. Finally, considerable attention is paid to satellite aerosol observability issues, with a face value comparison of common aerosol products in the region including passive and active aerosol products as well as fluxes. We show that satellite data products diverge greatly due to a host of known artifacts. These artifacts have important implications for how research is conducted, and care must be taken when using satellite products to study aerosol problems. The paper ends with a discussion of how the community can approach this complex and important environment.","Southeast Asia,Air Pollution,Biomass Burning,Aerosol,Meteorology,Remote Sensing,Maritime Continent,"
"maritime radar odometry inspired by visual odometry","2023","Future autonomous ships will need several redundant positioning systems to navigate reliably. Global Navigation Satellite Systems are highly accurate but they are susceptible to disruptions and intentional jamming. Maritime radars have long range and are robust against bad weather and darkness, but the use for ownship motion estimation has received relatively little attention in the research field. In this work, we present a radar odometry estimation method inspired by advances in visual odometry and simultaneous localization and mapping. The method works on raw radar data in a coastal environment and combines the Kanade-Lucas-Tomashi tracker with a factor graph back-end. We test it on data from a large ship with a maritime radar with a range of 19 km. We find that it is robust with only a small drift and no erroneous jumps in the estimate.","motion estimation,maritime,ownship motion estimation,distance measurement,darkness,robot vision,odometry,ship,SLAM (robots),Kanade-Lucas-Tomashi tracker,jamming,maritime radar odometry,bad weather,ships,satellite navigation,radar,visual odometry,Radar tracking,Radar clutter,Radar,Global Navigation Satellite Systems,path planning,Tracking,relatively little attention,size 19.0 km,radar odometry estimation method,raw radar data,mobile robots,Radar imaging,Visualization,positioning,navigation,future autonomous ships,Spaceborne radar,redundant positioning systems,intentional jamming,"
"multi-scale analysis reveals changing distribution patterns and the influence of social structure on the habitat use of an endangered marine predator, the sperm whale physeter macrocephalus in the western mediterranean sea","2020","The habitat use of marine megafauna emerges from the complex interplay between access to patchy and variable food resources and several intrinsic biological factors, such as the interaction with conspecifics and offspring care, resulting in dynamic distribution patterns. Quantifying species' relationships with the underlying environment is further complicated by the scale-dependent nature of these processes. Multi-scale analyses that incorporate aspects of a species' biology and build on large datasets are therefore required to understand long-term distribution and inform appropriate management measures. In this study, we use monitoring data collected over two study periods (2003–2008 and 2012–2018) to assess the habitat use, trend in local occurrence, and change in distribution of sperm whales, Physeter macrocephalus, around the Balearic Islands (Spain), one of the few recognised breeding and feeding grounds for the ‘Endangered’ population in the Mediterranean Sea. Moreover, we investigate the differences in the habitat use of single animals and groups, to explore intra-specific niche partitioning in this highly social but behaviourally dimorphic species. Results suggest that overall the occurrence of sperm whales in the area has been increasing over time. Animals were found to associate with distinct bathymetric features, but the mechanisms generating these relationships, and the underlying oceanographic processes within this habitat, remained uncertain. Sperm whale distribution also underwent a significant shift between the two study periods, with an increased occurrence in the Mallorca channel and north of Menorca, which further points towards a dynamic use of the broader bathymetric range preferred around the archipelago. Finally, our analyses highlighted that single animals and groups used areas with different characteristics, with groups preferring deeper, warmer waters characterised by lower sea level anomaly, which resulted in some fine-scale spatial segregation. The results of this study shed light on the mechanisms underpinning the biogeography and complex social system of the species, and support the design of targeted conservation measures in this important breeding and feeding ground.","Mediterranean sea,Distribution shift,Balearic archipelago,Sperm whale,Long-term monitoring,Habitat modeling,"

"exploiting the shipping lane information for energy-efficient maritime communications","2019","Energy efficiency is a crucial issue for maritime communications, due to the high path loss and limited number of geographically available base station sites. Different from previous studies, we promote the energy efficiency by exploiting the specific characteristics of maritime channels and user mobility. Particularly, we utilize the shipping lane information of marine users to estimate their large-scale channel state information. Based on that, the resource allocation is jointly optimized for all users over all time slots during the voyage, which is a mixed 0-1 non-convex programming problem. We transform this problem into a convex one by means of variable substitution and time-sharing relaxation, and propose an iterative algorithm to solve it based on the Lagrangian dual decomposition method. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can significantly reduce the power consumption compared with existing approaches, due to the global optimization over a much larger time span by utilizing the shipping lane information.","telecommunication power management,high path loss,Channel state information,Resource management,geographically available base station sites,user mobility,marine users,energy-efficient maritime communications,large-scale channel state information,Quality of service,ships,Power demand,Maritime communications,shipping lane,shipping lane information,optimisation,Two dimensional displays,maritime channels,nonconvex programming problem,Optimization,marine communication,Transforms,resource allocation,energy efficiency,"

"joint stochastic prediction of vessel kinematics and destination based on a maritime traffic graph","2022","Maritime traffic increases every year, and therefore also the amount of traffic data from the Automatic Identification System (AIS). Utilizing these data on traffic patterns and possible destinations for long-term vessel prediction is here an important way of gaining maritime situational awareness (MSA) for use in the decision making in autonomous ships, such as collision avoidance algorithms, which can reduce collision risk during voyage. In this article, we present a destination inference method based on piece-wise Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) processes for predicting vessel motions along common traffic lanes toward a set of destinations. The mean velocities of the processes are inferred through the creation of a maritime graph that represents the major traffic patterns in the area of consideration. After using an OU process for prediction along major sea lanes, the Equilibrium Reverting Velocity (ERV) bridging model is used to enable convergence of the prediction towards considered destinations. Then, based on the OU process and ERV bridging model for prediction, Bayesian inference is used to estimate the posterior destination distribution. Tested on a real-time AIS dataset, the method is shown to perform better than current state-of-the art methods in destination inference as it indirectly takes land and passed destinations into account.","Traffic control,mean velocities,Prediction algorithms,vessel kinematics,Bayes methods,equilibrium reverting velocity bridging model,Destination inference,traffic patterns,posterior destination distribution,Stochastic processes,Predictive models,traffic lanes,sea lanes,maritime situational awareness,long-term vessel prediction,piece-wise Ornstein-Uhlenbeck,Mechatronics,ships,marine safety,automatic identification system,marine engineering,stochastic processes,joint stochastic prediction,collision risk,maritime graph,real-time AIS dataset,maritime graphs,traffic data,Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes,vessel motions,maritime traffic graph,decision making,collision avoidance algorithms,Bayesian inference,Real-time systems,graph theory,ERV bridging model,telecommunication traffic,inference mechanisms,traffic engineering computing,Navigation,collision avoidance,OU process,AIS data,destination inference method,autonomous ships,"

"estimation of the contributions of the sources driving pm2.5 levels in a central mediterranean coastal town","2018","Receptor modelling techniques are widely used in order to identify the main natural and anthropogenic processes driving aerosol levels at a receptor. In this work, Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) was used to apportion PM2.5 levels at a traffic site (Msida) located in a coastal town. 180 filters collected throughout a yearly sampling campaign conducted in 2016, were chemically characterized by light absorbance analysis, x-ray fluorescence and ion chromatography in order to determine the concentrations of black carbon, 17 elements and 5 ions, respectively. The resulting chemical data base was used in conjunction with PMF in order to identify the 7 components affecting the PM2.5 levels at the receptor site. Six of these sources are considered to be typical of the atmospheric composition of coastal traffic sites: traffic (27.3%), ammonium sulfate (23.6%), Saharan dust (15%), aged sea salt (12.7%), shipping (5%) and fresh sea salt (4.6%). This is the first time that such a study was carried out in Malta and helps in understanding the aerosol pollution climate of the Central Mediterranean, which is still relatively understudied when compared to the Eastern and Western Mediterranean. Furthermore, we have isolated a factor exclusive to Malta: the fireworks component, which is responsible for 2.9% of the PM2.5 and which has health implications due to its chemical composition. The results of this work should also serve to guide the policy makers in achieving the necessary emission reductions in order to achieve the WHO guideline for PM2.5 by 2020.","PM,Positive matrix factorization,Natural aerosol sources,Anthropogenic aerosol sources,Source apportionment,Central mediterranean,"
"influence of climate variability on anchovy reproductive timing off northern chile","2016","We investigated the relationship between environmental variables and the Gonadosomatic Monthly Mean (GMM) index of anchovy (Engraulis ringens) to understand how the environment affects the dynamics of anchovy reproductive timing. The data examined corresponds to biological information collected from samples of the landings off northern Chile (18°21′S, 24°00′S) during the period 1990–2010. We used the Humboldt Current Index (HCI) and the Multivariate ENSO Index (MEI), which combine several physical-oceanographic factors in the Tropical and South Pacific regions. Using the GMM index, we studied the dynamics of anchovy reproductive timing at different intervals of length, specifically females with a length between 11.5 and 14cm (medium class) and longer than 14cm (large class). Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Mobile Average (SARIMA) was used to predict missing observations. The trends of the environment and reproductive indexes were explored via the Breaks For Additive Season and Trend (BFAST) statistical technique and the relationship between these indexes via cross-correlation functions (CCF) analysis. Our results showed that the habitat of anchovy switched from cool to warm condition, which also influenced gonad development. This was revealed by two and three significant changes (breaks) in the trend of the HCI and MEI indexes, and two significant breaks in the GMM of each time series of anchovy females (medium and large). Negative cross-correlation between the MEI index and GMM of medium and large class females was found, indicating that as the environment gets warmer (positive value of MEI) a decrease in the reproductive activity of anchovy can be expected. Correlation between the MEI index and larger females was stronger than with medium females. Additionally, our results indicate that the GMM index of anchovy for both length classes reaches two maximums per year; the first from August to September and the second from December to January. The intensity (maximum GMM values at rise point) of reproductive activity was not equal though, with the August–September peak being the highest. We also discuss how the synchronicity between environment and reproductive timing, the negative correlation found between MEI and GMM indexes, and the two increases per year of anchovy GMM relate to previous studies. Based on these findings we propose ways to advance in the understanding of how anchovy synchronize gonad development with the environment.","Length,Reproduction,Anchovy,Environment,Northern Chile,Humboldt Current System,"
"massive diatom bloom initiated by high winter sea ice in admiralty bay (king george island, south shetlands) in relation to nutrient concentrations in the water column during the 2009/2010 summer","2022","The South Shetland Islands, including King George Island (KGI), are located in the northern hydrographic zone on the West side of the Antarctic Peninsula (Northern WAP), which is washed mainly by the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC). Continuous vertical mixing of the water column by strong currents, violent tidal water exchanges in deep fjords and frequent strong winds do not favour the seasonal appearance of large phytoplankton blooms. In contrast, the southern WAP is bound by the continental shelf, and is under the influence of the weaker Antarctic Peninsula Coastal Current (APCC), maintaining seasonal winter sea ice, which provides a shallow mixed layer, which in turn supports high levels of biological production in summer. During the 2009 / 2010 summer, however, a distinctive bloom event (chl-a > 20 μgL−1) was documented for in Admiralty Bay (AB), the largest and deepest fjord in KGI. It commenced in early summer (29 December 2009) at the edge of melting sea ice which had persisted since the preceding cold winter of 2009. The phytoplankton group dynamics, determined using photosynthetic pigment data, and associated changes in nutrient concentration during the bloom, have been described in this paper. The area where the phytoplankton bloom developed coincided with the surface of the brash sea ice cover. The sequence and size of biological and chemical changes recorded within the fjord during the bloom resembled the recurring ice edge blooms which occur in the southern WAP, although they had a much shorter lifespan (< two weeks), which may have been due to the slow SE winds and related surface water movement direction, which hindered vertical mixing and kept the surface water within the fjord.","Nutrient dynamics,Maritime Antarctica,Antarctic fjord,HPLC pigment taxonomic group,West Antarctic peninsula,Phytoplankton bloom,"
"multiocular surveilance of wide dynamic environments based on optical vision, event modelling and end-to-end data encryption: a cloud-based monitoring approach of maritime activities","2012","The success of contemporary surveillance systems depends on their cost and their ability to automatically and correctly interpret events that take place in an observed environment. Correct decisions enhance the situation awareness of an operator, while wrong ones lead to false or no alarms, damaging the system's credibility. In this paper a low-cost, secure, cloud-based surveillance system is described for monitoring wide dynamic environments.

"exploring ais data for intelligent maritime routes extraction","2020","Maritime traffic route is the basis for the analysis of ship traffic characteristics and navigation safety. However, the spatial freedom of ship navigation makes the extraction of maritime traffic route a challenging task. In order to realize the extraction of ship traffic routes at sea, a maritime route extraction method based on ship history automatic identification system (AIS) data is proposed. In this method, the ship trajectory with rich position information is transformed into a ship trip semantic object (STSO) with semantic information, and each ship trip is abstracted as a “stop-waypoint-stop” trip object. In addition, based on the graph theory, the STSO is further integrated into the nodes and edges of a directed maritime traffic graph to realize the extraction and expression of the shipping routes. In order to prove the effectiveness of this method, the real-world AIS historical data are used for testing, and the results show that this method can effectively extract maritime traffic routes.","Automatic Identification System (AIS),Semantic trajectory,Shipping route,Maritime traffic,Graph theory,"

"a new efficient wave model for maritime training simulator","2001","The market for maritime training simulators is as important as the market for aeronautical training simulators. Many maritime accidents are caused by piloting errors in critical situations. Such situations are usually due to the environment (waves and streams). Hence, the main challenge of a maritime simulator is to simulate this environment as accurately as possible and, more precisely, to simulate ocean waves. Nowadays, two kinds of wave simulation theories are being presented. Firstly, accurate models are being created by physicists, while in computer graphics, researchers are putting forward some simpler physically-based models in order to produce static photorealistic images. This paper describes a new, efficient, real-time model of wave propagation and shows its integration in a real maritime simulator.","Aerospace simulation,piloting errors,streams,digital simulation,naval engineering computing,computer graphics,Marine vehicles,critical situations,efficient wave model,Ocean waves,maritime training simulator,Sonar navigation,marine systems,ocean waves,Computer graphics,realistic images,Accidents,real-time systems,computer based training,physically-based models,engineering graphics,static photorealistic images,environment,Instruments,wave propagation,real-time model,Computational modeling,maritime accidents,wave simulation theories,Layout,accidents,Marine animals,"
"an ais-based deep learning framework for regional ship behavior prediction","2021","This study presents a deep learning framework to support regional ship behavior prediction using historical AIS data. The framework is meant to aid in proactive collision avoidance, in order to enhance the safety of maritime transportation systems. In this study, it is suggested to decompose the historical ship behavior in a given geographical region into clusters. Each cluster will contain trajectories with similar behavior characteristics. For each unique cluster, the method generates a local model to describe the local behavior in the cluster. In this manner, higher fidelity predictions can be facilitated compared to training a model on all available historical behavior. The study suggests to cluster historical trajectories using a variational recurrent autoencoder and the Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise algorithm. The past behavior of a selected vessel is then classified to the most likely clusters of behavior based on the softmax distribution. Each local model consists of a sequence-to-sequence model with attention. When utilizing the deep learning framework, a user inputs the past trajectory of a selected vessel, and the framework outputs the most likely future trajectories. The model was evaluated using a geographical region as a test case, with successful results.","Collision avoidance,Deep learning,Maritime safety,Trajectory prediction,AIS,Ship navigation,Maritime situation awareness,"
"context-based models to overcome operational challenges in maritime security","2015","Piracy and smuggling are major international problems which not only threaten maritime security but also affect the global economy. Even though NATO and international forces have been relentlessly fighting maritime crime in East Africa (Gulf of Aden), the problems still persist and maritime crime has moved to West Africa (Gulf of Guinea). In the same vein, the Joint Interagency Task Force-South (JIATF-S) has had substantial operational success, controlling the vast geographical spread of smugglers in the East Pacific and Caribbean Sea. Due to limited number of maritime assets available, every resource needs to be efficiently allocated, both in time and space. This poses a great operational challenge requiring the integration and fusion of disparate information relevant to the mission and dynamic allocation of resources under uncertainty. Operational planning and execution for counter-smuggling and counter-piracy operations involve surveillance (to search, detect, track and identify potential threats) and interdiction operations (to intercept, investigate and potentially apprehend the suspects) in a dynamic and uncertain mission environment. In this paper, we present context-based models for counter-smuggling and counter-piracy missions, where the smuggling and piracy activities are represented in the form of color coded heat maps built using Intelligence information (INTEL), meteorological and oceanographic (METOC) information and other mission-specific attributes (sensor observations, target types and their behavior, etc.); these maps are interpreted as probability of activity (PoA) surfaces.

"mkcl: medical knowledge with contrastive learning model for radiology report generation","2023","Automatic radiology report generation has the potential to alert inexperienced radiologists to misdiagnoses or missed diagnoses and improve healthcare delivery efficiency by reducing the documentation workload of radiologists. Motivated by the continuous development of automatic image captioning, more and more deep learning methods have been proposed for automatic radiology report generation. However, the visual and textual data bias problem still face many challenges in the medical domain. Additionally, do not integrate medical knowledge, ignoring the mutual influences between medical findings, and abundant unlabeled medical images influence the accuracy of generating report. In this paper, we propose a Medical Knowledge with Contrastive Learning model (MKCL) to enhance radiology report generation. The proposed model MKCL uses IU Medical Knowledge Graph (IU-MKG) to mine the relationship among medical findings and improve the accuracy of identifying positive diseases findings from radiologic medical images. In particular, we design Knowledge Enhanced Attention (KEA), which integrates the IU-MKG and the extracted chest radiological visual features to alleviate textual data bias. Meanwhile, this paper leverages supervised contrastive learning to relieve radiographic medical images which have not been labeled, and identify abnormalities from images. Experimental results on the public dataset IU X-ray show that our proposed model MKCL outperforms other state-of-the-art report generation methods. Ablation studies also demonstrate that IU medical knowledge graph module and supervised contrastive learning module enhance the ability of the model to detect the abnormal parts and accurately describe the abnormal findings.

"ensemble estimates reveal a complex hydroclimatic sensitivity of pine growth at carpathian cliff sites","2012","Carpathian pine growth at its natural range limit, where small hydroclimatic fluctuations are indicated by tree-ring width anomalies, may provide insight into past ecological responses to climatic changes. Tree-ring chronologies from extreme cliff sites may also contain annually resolved and accurately dated information to facilitate the development of palaeoclimatic reconstructions. Complex and spatiotemporally inconsistent relationships between biotic and abiotic factors, however, often complicate our understanding of forest growth dynamics. In this study, we utilized a novel ensemble approach of 3240 growth–climate interactions to evaluate the likelihood of temporal fluctuations in the hydroclimatic sensitivity of three newly developed tree-ring width chronologies from 515 Scots pines (Pinus sylvestris). The data represent undisturbed cliff habitats across the northwestern Carpathian arc between 700 and 1050m asl. These sites are located in the northern (N) and southern (S) Tatra Mountains and in-between (M). Two sites (N, S) share common interannual to multi-decadal ring width variability (r=0.73), and they significantly capture variations in 20th-century summer drought conditions (r=0.52–0.65). Temporal instability in the growth–climate response, however, occurred in all three tree-ring chronologies, thus challenging any possible palaeoclimatic value. Orographic-induced climatology was found to dominate the observed growth–climate inconsistency, whereas age-related physiological mechanisms and differences in the absolute growth levels of the trees, as well as methodological standardization constraints and seasonal climate differences appeared to be less important. Our results suggest that environmental and ecological site criteria should be routinely supplemented by statistical data assessments prior to employing tree-ring chronologies for climate reconstructions.","Tatra Mountains,Dendroclimatology,Drought,Tree rings,Dendroecology,Climate variability,"
"a contextual hybrid model for vessel movement prediction","2021","Predicting the movement of the vessels can significantly improve the management of safety. While the movement can be a function of geographic contexts, the current systems and methods rarely incorporate contextual information into the analysis. This paper initially proposes a novel context-aware trajectoriesâ€™ simplification method to embed the effects of geographic context which guarantees the logical consistency of the compressed trajectories, and further suggests a hybrid method that is built upon a curvilinear model and deep neural networks. The proposed method employs contextual information to check the logical consistency of the curvilinear method and then, constructs a Context-aware Long Short-Term Memory (CLSTM) network that can take into account contextual variables, such as the vessel types. The proposed method can enhance the prediction accuracy while maintaining the logical consistency, through a recursive feedback loop. The implementations of the proposed approach on the Automatic Identification System (AIS) dataset, from the eastern coast of the United States of America which was collected, from November to December 2017, demonstrates the effectiveness and better compression, i.e. 80% compression ratio while maintaining the logical consistency. The estimated compressed trajectories are 23% more similar to their original trajectories compared to currently used simplification methods. Furthermore, the overall accuracy of the implemented hybrid method is 15.68% higher than the ordinary Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network which is currently used by various maritime systems and applications, including collision avoidance, vessel route planning, and anomaly detection systems.","recurrent neural nets,Safety,deep learning (artificial intelligence),Mathematical model,safety management,movement prediction,AIS dataset,Predictive models,curvilinear method,ubiquitous computing,deep neural networks,CLSTM network,ship behavior,deep learning,ships,automatic identification system dataset,marine safety,marine engineering,Data models,contextual hybrid model,contextual information,vessel movement prediction,United States of America,geographic context,data compression,Automatic identification system,vessel types,Trajectory,compressed trajectory estimation,context-aware LSTM network,vessel route planning,Deep learning,Context modeling,context-aware long short-term memory network,logical consistency,context-aware trajectories simplification,"
"assessment of tree and crown heights of a maritime pine forest at plot level using a fullwaveform ultraviolet lidar prototype","2010","This study aims to determine the potential of a new lidar prototype with an ultraviolet laser and a medium footprint for retrieving forest parameters. The lidar is embedded on an ultra-light aircraft. The choice of the Landes forest in southwestern France as study area was made regarding the flat topography of the area and the stand height consistency. We chose three plots from different stands (different height characteristics) and compared the lidar derived metries to field measurements. To derive metries from lidar data, we summed the lidar waveforms within a plot and calculated derived reflectance profiles to correct the lidar signal from the occlusion effect. We then retrieve plot mean total and mean crown base heights measurement from reflectance profiles. We obtain a good consistency of the lidar measurements compared to field measurements, even if we noticed the existence of a 5 to 10% bias probably linked to the lidar sampling strategy.","crown height,vegetation mapping,maritime pine forest,sampling methods,topography (Earth),signal analysis,Landes forest,ultralight aircraft,tree height,lidar,optical radar,lidar data,Decision support systems,height measurement,southwestern France,forestry,remote sensing by radar,topography,aerosols,fullwaveform ultraviolet lidar prototype,"
"grid size optimization for potential field based maritime anomaly detection","2014","This study focuses on improving the potential field based maritime data modeling method, developed to extract traffic patterns and detect anomalies, in a clear, understandable and informative way. The method's novelty lies in employing the concept of a potential field for AIS vessel tracking data abstraction and maritime traffic representation. Unlike the traditional maritime surveillance equipment, such as radar or GPS, the AIS system comprehensively represents the identity and properties of a vessel, as well as its behavior, thus preserving the effects of navigational decisions, based on the skills of experienced seamen. In the developed data modeling process, every vessel generates potential charges, which value represent the vessel's behavior, and drops the charges at locations it passes. Each AIS report is used to assign a potential charge at the reported vessel positions. The method derives three construction elements, which define, firstly, how charges are accumulated, secondly, how a charge decays over time, and thirdly, in what way the potential is distributed around the source charge. The collection of potential fields represents a model of normal behavior, and vessels not conforming to it are marked as anomalous. In the anomaly detection prototype system STRAND, the sensitivity of anomaly detection can be modified by setting a geographical coordinate grid precision to more dense or coarse. The objective of this study is to identify the optimal grid size for two different conditions – an open sea and a port area case. A noticeable shift can be observed between the results for the open sea and the port area. The plotted detection rates converge towards an optimal ratio for smaller grid sizes in the port area (60-200 meters), than in the open sea case (300-1000 meters). The effective outcome of the potential filed based anomaly detection is filtering out all vessels behaving normally and presenting a set of anomalies, for a subsequent incident analysis using STRAND as an information visualization tool.","maritime traffic,potential field,anomaly detection,AIS,"

"intelligent anomaly detection of trajectories for iot empowered maritime transportation systems","2023","The convergence of Maritime Transportation Systems (MTS) and Internet of Things (IoT) has led to the promising IoT-empowered MTS (IoT-MTS). However, abnormal trajectories of maritime transportation ships can have highly negative impacts on the management of IoT-MTS. Therefore, anomaly detection of trajectories is important for the successful deployment of IoT-MTS. In this paper, we propose a Transfer Learning based Trajectory Anomaly Detection strategy, named TLTAD, for IoT-MTS. Specifically, a variational autoencoder is used to discover the potential connections between each dimension of the normal trajectory, while a graph variational autoencoder is used to explore the spatial similarity between normal trajectories. Based on internal connection of trajectories, a deep reinforcement learning algorithm, Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic policy gradient (TD3), is employed to train the trajectory anomaly detection model. To reduce the model training time, transfer learning is used to migrate the trained anomaly detection model between different regions of an ocean area or between similar ocean areas. Moreover, an efficient data transformation module is designed to improve the efficiency of model transfer. The experiments were conducted on a real-world automatic identification system (AIS) dataset. The results indicate that the proposed TLTAD can provide accurate anomaly detection on shipsâ€™ trajectories in IoT-MTS with reduced model training times.","reduced model training times,Transportation,deep learning (artificial intelligence),Anomaly detection,maritime transportation systems,anomaly detection,Internet of Things,transportation,Marine vehicles,abnormal trajectories,Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic policy gradient,highly negative impacts,model training time,ships,IoT-MTS,trajectory anomaly detection model,deep reinforcement learning algorithm,Data models,normal trajectory,reinforcement learning,maritime transportation ships,Artificial intelligence,real-world automatic identification system dataset,Maritime Transportation Systems,graph variational autoencoder,trained anomaly detection model,Trajectory Anomaly Detection strategy,gradient methods,Deep reinforcement learning,model transfer,Trajectory,promising IoT-empowered MTS,intelligent Anomaly Detection,transfer learning,learning (artificial intelligence),data handling,Analytical models,"
"potential impact of long-life environmental sonobuoys on littoral asw","2009","The focus of military activity has recently shifted from large area engagements to regional conflicts. Consequently, supportive Naval maritime operations have continued to evolve toward littoral warfare in complicated shallow-water, near-shore environments. This evolution requires new sensors, advanced Concept of Operations, and improved data-analysis capabilities, among others. Planning operations in these harsh-environment areas is difficult because accurate predictions of tactical sensor performance depend on detailed knowledge of the local environmental conditions. Tactical mission planning is thus seldom optimal or efficient, often resulting in coverage gaps, increased risk, and reduced mission success. According to a Navy Mission Need Statement, 'Air ASW tactical execution, especially in littoral seas, requires in-situ environmental updates for preflight mission planning. In the conduct of ASW operations, an urgent need for explicit knowledge of environmental variables is required to optimize the effectiveness of operational acoustic sensors, as well as acoustic sensors in development ' The Naval Air Systems Command has considered extended-life environmental sonobuoy concepts to better characterize the littoral environment. Most designs contain a thermistor string to measure ocean temperatures and also hydrophones to measure ambient noise. This type of complex sonobuoy would be more expensive than a traditional single-measurement AXBT but it could provide a more thorough littoral environment assessment. This paper examines the trade-off between increased sensor complexity and improved ASW performance, in terms of cumulative detection probability. Some advantages of an extended-life combined thermistor string/hydrophone approach, compared to AXBTs and tactical hydrophones, are: 1) higher accuracy of the raw data; 2) temporal averaging to smooth out fluctuations; 3) extended area coverage during drift; 4) less chance for surface temperature anomalies (e.g., mixed-layer-depth errors) caused by various electronic and mechanical variability upon impact; 5) opportunities to discover thermal and acoustic feature boundaries during drift; and 6) less need to re-seed thus allowing longer tactical mission times. These advantages are evaluated relative to the following disadvantages: 1) increased cost; 2) potential drift outside the mission area; and 3) need for increased battery life for longer durations. The analysis is tempered by considering how a potential new system might be used. One assumption is that an environmental sampling decision aid is available to determine the minimum number and best initial locations of drifting sensors to meet performance objectives. The November 2007 Requirements Document from the Naval Oceanographic Office states ?Sampling guidance: Development of guidance on the best way to deploy, spatially and temporally, observation systems in order to meet various forecasting, model assimilation, and model evaluation objectives is needed.? Work in this area is reported in this Oceans '09 Conference in a paper entitled ?Uncertainty-based Adaptive AXBT Sampling with SPOTS?, which addresses optimal sampling requirements. For this trade-off analysis, temperature data from watersampling flights in the Sea of Japan off the east coast of Korea were used to simulate expected capability of a long-term drifting thermistor string. Then optimal initial positions for three notional buoys were determined followed by a simulation of drifting positions and data collected over 12 days. Ocean nowcasts were constructed and used to determine acoustic performance of a notional tactical sonobuoy field. The analysis shows that a drifting extended-life thermistor string can provide significant improvement in environmental characterization, tactical planning, and ASW detection performance.","Acoustic measurements,Sea measurements,military systems,Predictive models,Sonar equipment,Sampling methods,Ocean temperature,Noise measurement,littoral ASW,operational acoustic sensors,Thermistors,Temperature measurement,Acoustic sensors,long-life environmental sonobuoys,"
"societal need for improved understanding of climate change, anthropogenic impacts, and geo-hazard warning drive development of ocean observatories in european seas","2011","Society’s needs for a network of in situ ocean observing systems cross many areas of earth and marine science. Here we review the science themes that benefit from data supplied from ocean observatories. Understanding from existing studies is fragmented to the extent that it lacks the coherent long-term monitoring needed to address questions at the scales essential to understand climate change and improve geo-hazard early warning. Data sets from the deep sea are particularly rare with long-term data available from only a few locations worldwide. These science areas have impacts on societal health and well-being and our awareness of ocean function in a shifting climate. Substantial efforts are underway to realise a network of open-ocean observatories around European Seas that will operate over multiple decades. Some systems are already collecting high-resolution data from surface, water column, seafloor, and sub-seafloor sensors linked to shore by satellite or cable connection in real or near-real time, along with samples and other data collected in a delayed mode. We expect that such observatories will contribute to answering major ocean science questions including: How can monitoring of factors such as seismic activity, pore fluid chemistry and pressure, and gas hydrate stability improve seismic, slope failure, and tsunami warning? What aspects of physical oceanography, biogeochemical cycling, and ecosystems will be most sensitive to climatic and anthropogenic change? What are natural versus anthropogenic changes? Most fundamentally, how are marine processes that occur at differing scales related? The development of ocean observatories provides a substantial opportunity for ocean science to evolve in Europe. Here we also describe some basic attributes of network design. Observatory networks provide the means to coordinate and integrate the collection of standardised data capable of bridging measurement scales across a dispersed area in European Seas adding needed certainty to estimates of future oceanic conditions. Observatory data can be analysed along with other data such as those from satellites, drifting floats, autonomous underwater vehicles, model analysis, and the known distribution and abundances of marine fauna in order to address some of the questions posed above. Standardised methods for information management are also becoming established to ensure better accessibility and traceability of these data sets and ultimately to increase their use for societal benefit. The connection of ocean observatory effort into larger frameworks including the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) and the Global Monitoring of Environment and Security (GMES) is integral to its success. It is in a greater integrated framework that the full potential of the component systems will be realised.",""

"comparison of new technologies for data exchange in the maritime hf frequency band","2013","Recently, the use of HF radiotelex on ships, as the only terrestrial communication system for data exchange has been kept to a minimum, and the need for alternative systems, which would use the existing HF communication channels to exchange data between ships and end users on land, arose. Satellite communication systems represent the main aid for the exchange of large amounts of data with high transmission rates, but at high costs of equipment and services. Hence, there is the need to explore new, simpler and cheaper technologies for data exchange, which could be an alternative or a substitute for the existing radiotelex system.

"distribution and coalification patterns in canadian bituminous and anthracite coals","1989","Canadian resources of bituminous and anthracite coal occur in six of ten provinces and in the Yukon and Northwest Territories. These higher-rank coals are found in 12 of the 16 coal-bearing basins within Canada. For some of these basins, knowledge of rank and coalification patterns is limited; in others, it is extensive. Coalification patterns were examined in detail for two areas: the southern end of the Canadian Rocky Mountain coal belt which is underlain by the coal-bearing Kootenay Group and the Maritimes Basin which is underlain by several coal-bearing formations of Pennsylvanian (Late Carboniferous) age. In the southern Rockies, reflectances on coal range from 0.61 to 2.65% R0 max, which represent high-volatile B bituminous coal to semianthracite. In general, there is an increase in rank from SE to NW and from NE to SW. Superimposed on this pattern are several anomalies. At several locations, ranks change rapidly over short distances. An example is in the Mount Allan syncline, where the reflectances in the Kootenay section on the SW vertical limb range from 0.68 to 0.94% R0 max in contrast to a range of 1.30–2.49% R0 max for a comparable section on the NE upright limb. This variation occurs over a distance of about 3 km. Multiple intersections of Kootenay strata in oil wells at the south end of the area show low reflectances (0.76% Ro max) at depths of about 3800 m with no change in the shallower Kootenay repeats, whereas wells farther north show higher reflectances and increase with depth. Different burial depths, the influence of thick thrust plates, different paleogeothermal gradients and ground-water movements, all likely have played a part in generating these coalification patterns. A significant part of the coalification in the Kootenay Group appears to have been postdeformational. The rank of the coals in the various subbasins of the Maritimes Basin is nearly all bituminous. Evidence indicates that most of the coalification is postdeformational. Rank within a given coal bed generally increases with increase in depth of present-day burial and the pattern seems to be generally true for most of the coal fields studied. The average postdeformational component of total coalification has been calculated to be 72%. The most important coal field in the Maritimes Basin is the Sydney coal field. Here ranks have been shown to increase from NW to SE and from SW to NE, the latter direction following the downdip structure of the field. Coalification gradients for the Sydney field range from 0.052 to 0.088 R0 max/100 m, reflecting different paleogeothermal gradients. In New Brunswick, local rank increases to anthracite are believed to be related to igneous activities. Reflectance measurements have been used to interpret stratigraphy and structure in several fields and even to trace the origin of coaly fragments obtained from deep-sea drilling near Bermuda.",""

"ship trajectory prediction based on machine learning and deep learning: a systematic review and methods analysis","2023","Ship trajectory prediction based on Automatic Identification System (AIS) data has attracted increasing interest as it helps prevent collision accidents and eliminate potential navigational conflicts. Therefore, it is necessary and urgent to conduct a systematic analysis of all the prediction methods to help reveal their advantages to ensure safety at sea in different scenarios. It is particularly important and significant within the context of unmanned ships forming a new hybrid maritime traffic together with manned ships in the future. This paper aims to conduct a comparative analysis of the up-to-date ship trajectory prediction algorithms based on machine learning and deep learning methods. To do so, five classical machine learning methods (i.e., Kalman Filter, Gaussian Process Regression, Support Vector Regression, Random Forest, and Back Propagation Network) and eight deep learning methods (i.e., Recurrent Neural Networks, Long Short-Term Memory, Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory, Gate Recurrent Unit, Bi-directional Gate Recurrent Unit, Sequence to Sequence, Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network, and Transformer) are thoroughly analysed and compared from the algorithm essence and applications to excavate their features and adaptability for manned and unmanned ships. The findings reveal the characteristics of various prediction methods and provide valuable implications for different stakeholders to guide the best-fit choice of a particular method as the solution under a specific circumstance. It also makes contributions to the extraction of the research difficulties of ship trajectory prediction and the corresponding solutions that are put forward to guide the development of future research.","Deep learning,Maritime safety,Hybrid maritime traffic,Trajectory prediction,AIS data,Machine learning,"
"minimum winter temperature reconstruction from average earlywood vessel area of european oak (quercus robur) in n-poland","2016","Tree-ring-based temperature reconstructions form a substantial part of the international proxy data base used to examine and model global climate variations of the last Millennium. However, most tree-ring-based reconstructions are derived from study sites in the high latitudes or high altitudes, paying very little attention to low elevation sites. Thus, a large gap in the geographical coverage of climate reconstructions from temperate low elevation sites in central Europe still exists. This motivated us to concentrate our efforts on the European oak (Quercus robur) in N-Poland. We developed a new robust tree-ring width chronology (TRW), as well as four wood anatomical chronologies (e.g. average vessel area and number of vessels) from Q. robur for the period 1810 to 2010. The chronologies were examined for their climatological responses. While TRW was found to have weak correlations with climate, the earlywood vessel parameters (EVP), especially average vessel area (AVA), revealed significant positive correlations to minimum winter temperatures. Based on stable climate–growth correlations, a reconstruction of minimum winter temperatures (29th November to 20th January) back to 1810 was performed for north Poland. The reconstruction indicates a promising potential to reveal low-frequency climate information. An additional extreme year analysis suggested that in cold winters, a cold–warm–cold pattern in the minimum temperatures was responsible for the relatively small earlywood vessels. Spatial field correlations imply that our reconstruction is more related to temperature variations towards the east of Europe. The reconstructed temperature compared well with two existing temperature reconstructions, especially during most of the 20th century, even though the temperature reconstructions differ spatially and temporally. Based on these findings, the relatively extensive resource of archeological oak material from this region may be useful to perform multicentennial climate reconstructions in the temperate climate zone.","Temperature reconstruction,Poland,Temperate lowlands,Wood anatomy,Dendroclimatology,Earlywood vessel parameter,"
"gis-based simulation methodology for evaluating ship encounters probability to improve maritime traffic safety","2019","Evaluating ship encounters probability efficiently is significant for maritime transportation risk analysis as well as improving maritime traffic safety. In practice, ship encounters probability estimate by using traditional observation or field experiments is nearly impossible due to the expensive cost. In this paper, we propose a methodology framework for evaluating ship encounters probability based on an agent-based simulation paradigm. Individual shipâ€™s navigation behavior is modeled as an agent, and their encounters are detected by an innovative geographic information system (GIS)-based intelligent algorithm. We then design and implement a prototype simulator based on the methodology framework and apply it in the mid-western waters of Bohai Sea of China to demonstrate its functionalities and utility.

"trial results of a new low-cost and covert technology to trace the path of maritime containers worldwide","2008","There are approximately 7 million maritime style containers within Canada, and 70 million within the USA. The interiors of such containers are rarely inspected. With market globalization, a large amount of these containers enter North America on a daily basis. Such containers may include contraband or dangerous items that present an economic or security risk. Despite significant security improvements, only 3 to 5% of the maritime containers, that arrive in or transition through North America, go through physical inspection. Current container tracking technologies based on GPS consume high DC power, are costly, require line-of-sight with satellites and they are often too large to be covert. It is possible to overcome some of these limitations by basing the tracking system on the FM broadcast signal which is an alternative man-made signal that is reasonably ubiquitous, provides a geographically unique frequency spectrum and is about 100,000 as strong as a GPS satellite signal. This allows the development of a low cost, low power and miniature FM receiver that can record frequency spectrums and compare them to known data in order to trace the path that the container has taken for less than 10$ per container. This paper presents the first results of highway trials (train and sea trials are to be conducted in 2009) of such a low cost, covert, non-GPS based technology (called 'FM Tag') that records the worldwide displacement of containers and displays the path undertaken by the container while in transit. As an added security benefit, the tag is also capable of detecting container door openings. In addition to presenting the first trial results, this paper covers the innovative engineering aspects of using the metal enclosure of a maritime container as a VHF antenna, thereby eliminating the need to add an external antenna and achieving the goal of being 100% covert.","Maritime container traceability,Costs,Inspection,low-cost covert technology,Global Positioning System,FM broadcast signal,ships,Containers,alternative man-made signal,high DC power,Maritime container intrusion sensor and Article traceability,Globalization,market globalization,maritime containers path,GPS,Satellite broadcasting,North America,Frequency,Power generation economics,Security,"
"graphstgan: situation understanding network of slow-fast high maneuvering targets for maritime monitor services of iot data","2023","With the rapid growth of the maritime internet of things (IoT) devices for maritime monitor services (MMS), maritime traffic controllers could not handle a massive amount of data in time. For unmanned MMS, one of the key technologies is situation understanding. However, the complex motion of sea surface targets, the presence of slow-fast high maneuvering targets and track breakages due to radar blind zones make modeling the dynamics of marine multi-agents difficult, and pose significant challenges to maritime situation understanding. In order to comprehend the situation accurately and thus offer unmanned MMS, it is crucial to model the complex dynamics of multi-agents using IoT big data. Nevertheless, previous methods typically rely on complex assumptions, are plagued by unstructured data, and disregard the interactions between multiple agents and the spatial-temporal correlations. A deep learning model-Graph neural Spatial-Temporal GAN (GraphSTGAN) Network is proposed in this paper, which uses graph neural network to model unstructured data and uses STGAN to learn the spatial-temporal dependencies and the interaction. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method.","Maritime monitoring services,Multi-agents,Graph neural network,Internet of things,"

"detection and mapping of shipwrecks embedded in sea-floor sediments","2015","The paper discusses the detection of shipwrecks embedded in sea-floor sediments using a Chirp sub-bottom profiler. From a methodological-historical perspective it presents four examples of recent chirp recordings of verified shipwrecks embedded in different types of sediment environments, from different geographical and geological areas and from different periods. The effects of shallow water depths, different sediment types, recording speed and different (2D and 3D) sub-bottom profiler systems are briefly discussed. It is concluded that Chirps are well suited for survey purposes, producing high quality 2D profiles of good resolution and satisfactory penetration depth. Furthermore, the equipment is easy to handle from a small boat and allows flexible sailing. This type of 2D data is cheaper and faster to acquire and is easier to interpret and apparently also provides better resolution and detail than present 3D systems. Chirp data are therefore of great value in identifying and outlining shipwrecks hidden in the sea floor in survey situations where larger areas must be covered. The overall conclusion is that there are grounds for optimism with regard to this method of detection of maritime archaeological targets.","Subbottom seismics,Shallow water,Hard sediments,Akko,Mapping,Shipwreck,Detection,Maritime archaeology,"

A comparison is made between satellite communication and the existing MF/HF system, including direct-printing radio telegraph (marine radio telex). From various standpoints, it appears that maritime satellite systems are more desirable than conventional (nontelex) marine telegraph/telephone. In addition, the improved performance, capability, and potential of satellites could outweigh the slightly lower annual traffic and equipment cost for HF marine telex.","Telegraphy,Oceans,Telephony,Marine-vehicle navigation,Satellite navigation systems,Satellite broadcasting,Communication industry,multiaccess,Costs,Satellite communication,Radio navigation position measurement,Marine vehicles,Shipbuilding industry,Marine-vehicle communication,Government,"
"cetacean occurrence and spatial distribution: habitat modelling for offshore waters in the portuguese eez (ne atlantic)","2015","In the Portuguese Economic Exclusive Zone (EEZ) (NE Atlantic), little survey effort dedicated to cetacean species has been carried out in offshore waters. As a consequence, data on their occurrence, distribution and habitat preferences is scarce. In this area, 48 sea surveys along fixed transects within Continental Portugal and Madeira Island were performed in 2012 and 2013, from July to October, using platforms of opportunity. We used an environmental envelope approach and GAM habitat models to identify the role of oceanographic, topographic and geographical variables in shaping cetacean distribution. Results demonstrate the richness of offshore waters in this area as in 10,668nmi sampled, we recorded 218 sightings from at least nine cetacean species, resulting in an overall ER of 2.04 sightings/100nmi. The interaction of topographic and oceanographic features was shown to influence the distribution of the species/groups along the routes. Among the sighted species, only common dolphin showed a preference for coastal waters, while for all the other species high seas proved to be determinant. This result reinforces the need to address conservation issues in open ocean. This preliminary assessment showed the importance of the entire area for the distribution of different cetacean species and allowed the identification of several species/group specific potential suitable habitats. Considering the Habitats Directive resolutions, ACCOBAMS priorities, EEZ extension for the area and Maritime Spatial Planning Directive, and the urgent need for management plans, we suggest that the sampling strategy here presented is a cost-effective method to gather valuable data, to be used to improve cetacean habitat models in the area.","Management,Cetacean distribution,Portuguese EEZ,High seas,Habitat modelling,"

Aim of this paper is the detection and description of the main changes (seasonal and interannual) in the water masses' characteristics that are related to the seawater quality of the North Thermaikos. The connection between the main forcing factors and the major circulation patterns is also under investigation. The interannual analysis of the collected data revealed the existence of strong seasonal fluctuations that present significant deviations from a mean seasonal pattern in specific periods. A general decreasing trend of the salinities of the domain is observed during the study period. At the same time, a strong relation between open Aegean Sea waters and riverine freshwater fluxes is identified, factors that significantly influence stratification, circulation and renewal of the gulf.

"leveraging graph and deep learning uncertainties to detect anomalous maritime trajectories","2022","Understanding and representing traffic patterns are key to detecting anomalous trajectories in the transportation domain. However, some trajectories can exhibit heterogeneous maneuvering characteristics despite confining to normal patterns. Thus, we propose a novel graph-based trajectory representation and association scheme for extraction and confederation of traffic movement patterns, such that data patterns and uncertainty can be learned by deep learning (DL) models. This paper proposes the usage of a recurrent neural network (RNN)-based evidential regression model, which can predict trajectory at future timesteps as well as estimate the data and model uncertainties associated, to detect anomalous maritime trajectories, such as unusual vessel maneuvering, using automatic identification system (AIS) data. Furthermore, we utilize evidential deep learning classifiers to detect unusual turns of vessels and the loss of transmitted signal using predicted class probabilities with associated uncertainties. Our experimental results suggest that the graphical representation of traffic patterns improves the ability of the DL models, such as evidential and Monte Carlo dropout, to learn the temporal-spatial correlation of data and associated uncertainties. Using different datasets and experiments, we demonstrate that the estimated prediction uncertainty yields fundamental information for the detection of traffic anomalies in the maritime and, possibly in other domains.","Monte Carlo methods,classification,recurrent neural nets,graph,deep learning (artificial intelligence),Anomaly detection,DL models,graph-based trajectory representation,automatic identification system data,Monte Carlo dropout,graphical representation,traffic movement patterns,detect anomalous maritime trajectories,Predictive models,regression analysis,evidential deep learning,marine engineering,Data models,data patterns,pattern classification,Artificial intelligence,graph theory,RNN,regression,clustering,uncertainty,Trajectory,Uncertainty,probability,Computational modeling,traffic engineering computing,recurrent neural network-based evidential regression model,deep learning uncertainties,AIS data,"

In order for the decision makers responsible for the Maritime Security and Defense of North America to effectively execute their missions, they require both an understanding of their current capabilities and gaps, and a means to determine the capability requirements to close any identified gaps. This paper presents the Maritime Timeline Analysis and Requirements Toolset (M-TART) as a modeling and simulation solution to address this problem. The M-TART is a deterministic, scenario-based model that accounts for the various states of the maritime event timeline and provides decision makers with statistical and graphical information regarding current capabilities and gaps.","computer graphics,maritime defense,cyberspace domain,Maritime Security of North America,aerospace domain,Monitoring,maritime security,military computing,graphical information,Force,Availability,Oceans,land domain,maritime timeline and analysis requirements toolset,Probability,Security,statistical information,maritime event timeline,Analytical models,statistics,"
"providing engineering support to advance maritime research through successful at-sea experimentations: 60 yearsâ€™ experience in cmre facing evolving complex challenges and providing efficient solutions. a practical example","2019","Providing state-of-the-art, at-sea engineering capability to advance maritime research has been for 60 years a day-to-day mission for the NATO Centre for Maritime Research and Experimentation (CMRE). Along those years, CMRE has been demonstrating its excellence in such endeavor, gaining worldwide recognition and awards. Numerous scientific and technology breakthrough were achieved, that were carefully transitioned and are now in use within the NATO Navies. While at-sea experimentation remains a fundamental stage to validate and advance research in the maritime domain, well performing during maritime operations is not a chance, requiring extensive experience, and expertise in multiple complementary domains. Such multidisciplinary approach includes underwater acoustics, oceanography, electronics, mechanical and ocean engineering, through embedded and real time software and data management, up to the more recent domain of unmanned systems. The purpose of this paper aims at making aware the OCEANS Research Community, by means of a description of a recent at-sea experimentation, on how complex and how challenging it may be for a well experienced and dedicated engineering team to ensure the success of a scientific at-sea trial, Description of issues that had to be faced during the preparation and the execution of the sea trials are given. Solving them allowed the proper collection of calibrated and validated data sets, necessary for the Researchers to confirm and verify their models and algorithms. Some examples of the scientific achievements are given, to illustrate the relevance of the provided engineering support.","multiple complementary domains,day-to-day mission,Acoustic arrays,numerous scientific technology breakthrough,naval engineering,remotely operated vehicles,aware the OCEANS Research Community,worldwide recognition,triplet array,Marine vehicles,ocean engineering,underwater acoustics,autonomy,oceanography,Cranes,electronics,providing engineering support,marine systems,oceanographic equipment,NATO Navies,NATO Centre,marine engineering,Oceans,time 60.0 year,maritime domain,at-sea experimentation,at-sea engineering capability,underwater acoustic communication,data management,extensive experience,Acoustics,real time software,provided engineering support,Software,underwater sound,providing state-of-the-art,advance maritime research,calibration,unmanned systems,dedicated engineering team,Sensors,maritime operations,military vehicles,sea trials,mechanical ocean engineering,providing efficient solutions,at-sea experimentations,oceanographic techniques,"
"ship behavior prediction via trajectory extraction-based clustering for maritime situation awareness","2022","This study presents a method in which historical AIS data are used to predict the future trajectory of a selected vessel. This is facilitated via a system intelligence-based approach that can be subsequently utilized to provide enhanced situation awareness to navigators and future autonomous ships, aiding proactive collision avoidance. By evaluating the historical ship behavior in a given geographical region, the method applies machine learning techniques to extrapolate commonalities in relevant trajectory segments. These commonalities represent historical behavior modes that correspond to the possible future behavior of the selected vessel. Subsequently, the selected vessel is classified to a behavior mode, and a trajectory with respect to this mode is predicted. This is achieved via an initial clustering technique and subsequent trajectory extraction. The extracted trajectories are then compressed using the Karhunen–Loéve transform, and clustered using a Gaussian Mixture Model. The approach in this study differs from others in that trajectories are not clustered for an entire region, but rather for relevant trajectory segments. As such, the extracted trajectories provide a much better basis for clustering relevant historical ship behavior modes. A selected vessel is then classified to one of these modes using its observed behavior. Trajectory predictions are facilitated using an enhanced subset of data that likely correspond to the future behavior of the selected vessel. The method yields promising results, with high classification accuracy and low prediction error. However, vessels with abnormal behavior degrade the results in some situations, and have also been discussed in this study.","Collision avoidance,Unsupervised learning,Trajectory prediction,AIS,Machine learning,Ship navigation,Maritime situation awareness,"
"heterogeneous swarms for maritime dynamic target search and tracking","2020","Current strategies employed for maritime target search and tracking are primarily based on the use of agents following a predetermined path to perform a systematic sweep of a search area. Recently, dynamic Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithms have been used together with swarming multi-robot systems (MRS), giving search and tracking solutions the added properties of robustness, scalability, and flexibility. Swarming MRS also give the end-user the opportunity to incrementally upgrade the robotic system, inevitably leading to the use of heterogeneous swarming MRS. However, such systems have not been well studied and incorporating upgraded agents into a swarm may result in degraded mission performances. In this paper, we propose a PSO-based strategy using a topological k-nearest neighbor graph with tunable exploration and exploitation dynamics with an adaptive repulsion parameter. This strategy is implemented within a simulated swarm of 50 agents with varying proportions of fast agents tracking a target represented by a fictitious binary function. Through these simulations, we are able to demonstrate an increase in the swarm's collective response level and target tracking performance by substituting in a proportion of fast buoys.","fast agents,predetermined path,topological k-nearest neighbor graph,heterogeneous swarms,maritime dynamic target search,tracking solutions,Multi-Robot Search,multi-robot systems,multirobot systems,particle swarm optimisation,target tracking,tunable exploration,upgraded agents,maritime target search,Target tracking,Dynamic Target Search,heterogeneous swarming MRS,Particle swarm optimization,Scalability,Robots,exploitation dynamics,degraded mission performances,systematic sweep,Heterogeneous Swarm,graph theory,Robustness,dynamic particle swarm optimization algorithms,end-user,robotic system,mobile robots,simulated swarm,adaptive repulsion parameter,PSO-based strategy,marine vehicles,Swarm Intelligence,Heuristic algorithms,Systematics,"
"a method for maritime target tracking based on kernelized spectral filter","2022","Maritime target tracking can be applied in the fields of intelligent marine transportation and resource protection. The spectral filter tracking method focuses on the adaptability of the local appearance changes of targets, with the graph representation. Considering the complexity and diversity of the marine environment, we propose a maritime target tracking algorithm based on kernelized spectral filter. The spectral filtering is modeled as a tracking framework based on kernel regression. According to graph signal processing and spectral graph theory, based on the description of kernel regression on graph signals, we deduce and discuss the construction of the filter, the calculation of kernel matrix, the solution of kernel regression model, and the prediction of tracking position. With the help of a nonlinear model, it can effectively improve the precision under complex tracking conditions. The experimental results on the benchmark dataset verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, especially when the target tracking is affected by waves or wakes.","graph representation,graph signal processing,matrix algebra,Feature extraction,intelligent transportation systems,kernel regression,Predictive models,regression analysis,kernel matrix,Filtering algorithms,Filtering,target tracking,position tracking,Target tracking,spectral filter tracking method,particle filtering (numerical methods),kernelized spectral filter,Signal processing,graph theory,kernel regression model,spectral graph theory,resource protection,spectral filtering,Signal processing algorithms,maritime target tracking,intelligent marine transportation,"
