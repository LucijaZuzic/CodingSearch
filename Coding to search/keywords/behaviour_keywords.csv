"water penetrating radar","2021","Ground penetrating radar (GPR) is a commonly-usedgeophysicaltechnique, yet the use of water-penetrating radar (WPR) has been less-well researched and published on. This is surprising, given the wide use of GPR on ice and the success of early aquatic experiments in the 1970s and 1980s. The past 15 years have seen advances in modes of antenna deployment, understanding of limiting environmental conditions and applications to geotechnical engineering (e.g. bridge support scour), siltation (e.g. sedimentation in reservoirs and flood-relief water-courses, sometimes due to climate change); location of sediment cores for palaeoecology; search and rescue operations and environmental crime (e.g. illegal dumping of waste in water). This manuscript will review the above, from common techniques through to typical applications with geotechnical engineering, archaeological and forensic case studies that demonstrate some of the surveys covered in the review.","Archaeology,Palaeoenvironments,Civil engineering,Radar,Forensic science,"
"context-driven dynamic risk management for maritime domain awareness","2016","Endowing Decision Support Systems (DSSs) with a risk-aware view of the environment they operate in is critical to maintaining an acceptable level of Situational Awareness (SAW) as well as helping decision makers arrive at more accurate and timely conclusions. In particular, determining the situational elements that are presently impacting the system behaviour - and to what extent- leads to a refined SAW picture and ensures valuable knowledge propagation to the upstream layers of the underlying fusion/decision making process. In this paper, we augment an existing Risk Management Framework (RMF) with a set of atomic risk models capturing different situational elements. Contextual information feeding the DSS is employed to either activate one or more of these models or tailor their internal risk assessment. We show how context-aware dynamic risk management can be achieved in a DSS governed by the proposed architecture. Two maritime scenarios (vessel encountering active weather and vessel navigating in a piracy-infested region) serve to illustrate the advantages of the proposed context-aware methodology in terms of improved situational understanding, system interpretability, support to other fusion processes (e.g., threat assessment) and computational tractability. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that contextual information is used to drive the risk assessment module of a DSS. The methodology is not exclusive to the maritime arena and can be easily extrapolated to other domains.","decision support systems,RMF,Risk management,context-driven dynamic risk management,Hidden Markov models,maritime domain awareness,Feature extraction,Meteorology,ubiquitous computing,marine engineering,SAW,risk management,contextual information,decision making,situational awareness,knowledge propagation,Decision support systems,DSS,Context modeling,knowledge based systems,Random access memory,"
"improving the maritime surface picture with a visualization aid to provide rapid situation awareness of information uncertainty","2009","The maintenance of good situational awareness by government agencies for the maritime surface picture is of critical importance for national security, regional safety, pollution mitigation, immigration enforcement and protection from smuggling etc. Unfortunately, this picture, as currently implemented, provides the user with no immediate awareness of the quality or timeliness of the information for any specific vessel track that is plotted. The present research describes the development of visualization concepts in the form of icons that can be integrated into the existing symbology used to plot the picture. Several design concepts were initially developed and evaluated heuristically against Human Factors principles. Subsequently, the best candidates were evaluated in the laboratory for their capability for improving situational awareness in a search task. The results provided evidence of which designs were more effective, and how they could potentially make operational decisions more effective by increasing awareness of the underlying data uncertainty. Each of the designs was then evaluated by Navy operators who performed simulated operational tasks and assessed the utility and usability of the new functionality. The results of the experiment and the outcome of this validation process were then used to support a recommendation as to which design would be proposed for future implementation.","Pollution,National security,Safety,rapid situation awareness,situation awareness,Laboratories,data visualisation,Human factors,situational awareness maintenance,data uncertainty,marine systems,military computing,Surface contamination,visualization aid,human factors principle,Protection,maritime surface picture,information uncertainty,uncertainty,Uncertainty,Visualization,image processing,visualization,component,Government,"
"a comprehensive maritime benchmark dataset for detection, tracking and threat recognition","2021","This paper describes a new multimodal maritime dataset recorded using a multispectral suite of sensors, including AIS, GPS, radar, and visible and thermal cameras. The visible and thermal cameras are mounted on the vessel itself and surveillance is performed around the vessel in order to protect it from piracy at sea. The dataset corresponds to a series of acted scenarios which simulate attacks to the vessel by small, fast-moving boats (â€˜skiffsâ€™). The scenarios are inspired by real piracy incidents at sea and present a range of technical challenges to the different stages in an automated surveillance system: object detection, object tracking, and event recognition (in this case, threats towards the vessel). The dataset can thus be employed for training and testing at several stages of a threat detection and classification system. We also present in this paper baseline results that can be used for benchmarking algorithms performing such tasks. This new dataset fills a lack of publicly available datasets for the development and testing of maritime surveillance applications.","comprehensive maritime benchmark dataset,Benchmark testing,visible cameras,Thermal sensors,Sensor phenomena and characterization,computer crime,multimodal maritime dataset,thermal cameras,classification system,automated surveillance system,object tracking,cameras,object detection,image classification,Radar,marine engineering computing,event recognition,maritime surveillance applications,Boats,Object detection,Surveillance,video surveillance,threat recognition,threat detection,piracy incidents,"
"a novel technique to identify ais transmissions from vessels which attempt to obscure their position by switching their ais transponder from normal transmit power mode to low transmit power mode","2022","Automatic Identification Systems (AIS) are transponder systems installed on marine vessels which transmit the location, speed and other vessel details. These signals are received by shore side AIS Base stations. The use of AIS is mandatory under international SOLAS regulations for certain categories of vessels. AIS is used to monitor for pollution, search and rescue (SAR) and illegal fishing activity. Some vessel operators deliberately interfere with their AIS transponders, including spoofing their real position or switching their AIS transponder to low transmit power, to reduce the likelihood of being detected but still being in compliance with SOLAS regulations. This might suggest that they are involved in nefarious activity. This paper presents a technique to detect vessels which are switching their Class-A, AIS transponders from normal transmit power to low transmit power mode, by utilising the Received Signal strength Indicator field (RSSI) that the receiving Base Station tags incoming AIS messages with. The technique presented, analyses received RSSI in combination with predicted RSSI values via mathematical modelling and presents a unique detection algorithm. Data from the Irish National AIS was used for the study. Although only a small amount of testing was carried out, results showed that for a test vessel which switched its transponder to low power transmit mode, it was found that a specific drop in RSSI of approximately 10 dBm (decibel-milliwatts) was detectable for different distances from the receiving base station.","AIS spoofing,Received signal strength indicator,Low transmit power,Sybil attack,Automatic identification system,"
"applicability of alos2 to maritime surveillance","2014","The recent increase in seaborne piracy attacks on the important sea lanes such as Straits of Malacca and Gulf of Aden significantly affects to not only security of the crews but also economy around the marine transportation. In addition to that, the issues of illegal fishing boats around Exclusive economic zone (EEZ) and oil spills has made ocean surveillance one of the most important SAR applications for safe navigation of ships due to its flexible operability. In this context, an experimental investigation of the applicability of PALSAR2/ALOS2, facilitating the world's most flexible pointing ability and various observation modes at L-band, to maritime monitoring is scheduled. The validation plan and the core image processing technology to support the global ocean surveillance by ALOS2 are also introduced.",""

Second, the KGS information also will be calculated on the drone by placing a small computer. The result of this preliminary research is the UAV design with the capability to do KGS computation. The simulation also was conducted with KGS calculation using many indicators and hypothesis. In testing, we use 19 indicators, 6 hypotheses, and 36 observations.

"spatial ontologies for detecting abnormal maritime behaviour","2012","The upsurge in piracy and the impact of recent environmental disasters have highlighted the need to improve maritime surveillance. Governmental and private initiatives have developed monitoring systems with improved acquisition and analysis capabilities. These systems rely on one major component, namely the detection of abnormal ship behaviour. This implies a detailed formalisation of expert knowledge. However, the quantity of data, the complexity of situations, the failure to take into account their spatial characteristics and the potential for the same scenario to be interpreted in different ways have proved to be significant problems. We therefore propose a new prototype for the analysis of abnormal ship behaviour. The system is based on a spatial ontology associated with a geographical inference engine. It automatically identifies suspicious vessels and associates them with probable behaviours defined by operational staff.","surveillance,disasters,abnormal ship behaviour detection,Anomaly detection,spatial ontology,Marine vehicles,monitoring systems,geographical inference engine,detailed expert knowledge formalisation,Maritime surveillance systems,OWL,ships,operational staff,environmental disasters,marine engineering,maritime surveillance,acquisition capabilities,automatic suspicious vessel identification,piracy,ontologies (artificial intelligence),private initiatives,expert systems,abnormal maritime behaviour detection,inference mechanisms,Spatial ontology,Ontologies,governmental initiatives,Engines,Sensors,Surveillance,Automated reasoning,"
"unmanned aircraft systems for maritime operations: choosing 'a' good design for achieving operational effectiveness","2016","Modern navies perform various missions such as maritime security, maritime interdiction, and counter piracy operations in addition to their traditional wartime duties. However, most warships are not built flexible enough to conduct these tasks. Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) increase the flexibility of the warships and enhance mission success. The capabilities of the UAS determine how effective the mission is performed. However, tactical decisions in using UAS also affect the results of a mission. Therefore, deciding on the design parameters requires a thorough analysis of how UAS will be used together with other assets in maritime operations. This paper presents some of the current maritime challenges, explains the use of UAS in maritime operations, and assesses the operational effectiveness of UAS in a Maritime Interdiction Operation scenario using an agent-based modelling and simulation platform. The results show that UAS significantly increase the mission success, and that there is not one set of parameters to achieve a certain level of effectiveness, there may be various UAS designs which yield same results.","aircraft,Unmanned Aircraft Systems,Marine vehicles,Aircraft,Buildings,Unmanned Aerial Vehicle,modelling and simulation,Maritime Interdiction Operation,Atmospheric modeling,agent-based modelling,navy,application,unmanned aircraft systems,design,autonomous aerial vehicles,Unmanned aerial vehicles,Sensors,operational effectiveness,maritime operations,Security,UAS,maritime interdiction operation scenario,UAV,"
"parsec, an application of probabilistic case based reasoning to maritime surveillance","2009","This paper describes the theoretical basis and practical implementation of PARSEC, a knowledge-based system that uses probabilistic case based reasoning. PARSEC is a major component in the PANDA surveillance system, developed under DARPA leadership to support maritime situation awareness monitoring on a global scale. PANDA detects unusual vessel motions (deviations) based on learned normalcy models and then flags those particular deviations that an analyst is likely to describe as remarkable or suspicious, given the available context for the deviation. The context data include information on weather and sea-state, notices to mariners, piracy events, vessel ownership changes, commodity prices, and other information. Performance evaluation results with real data confirm that PARSEC greatly reduces the probability of false alarm while maintaining a high probability of detecting those deviations that require an analyst's attention.","surveillance,Motion analysis,PARSEC,Monitoring,alarm systems,piracy events,probabilistic case based reasoning,Knowledge based systems,marine safety,marine engineering,maritime surveillance,object detection,maritime situation awareness monitoring,DARPA leadership,sea-state condition evaluation,false alarm reduction,Jacobian matrices,learned normalcy model,Tracking,PANDA surveillance system,unusual vessel motion detection,Motion detection,Pattern analysis,Context modeling,Surveillance,case-based reasoning,Detectors,"
"machine learning-assisted anomaly detection in maritime navigation using ais data","2020","The automatic identification system (AIS) reports vessels' static and dynamic information, which are essential for maritime traffic situation awareness. However, AIS transponders can be switched off to hide suspicious activities, such as illegal fishing, or piracy. Therefore, this paper uses real world AIS data to analyze the possibility of successful detection of various anomalies in the maritime domain. We propose a multi-class artificial neural network (ANN)-based anomaly detection framework to classify intentional and non-intentional AIS on-off switching anomalies. The multi-class anomaly framework captures AIS message dropouts due to various reasons, e.g., channel effects or intentional one for carrying illegal activities. We extract position, speed, course and timing information from real world AIS data, and use them to train a 2-class (normal and anomaly) and a 3-class (normal, power outage and anomaly) anomaly detection models. Our results show that the models achieve around 99.9% overall accuracy, and are able to classify a test sample in the order of microseconds.","security of data,maritime traffic situation awareness,multiclass anomaly framework,pattern classification,multiclass artificial neural network,AIS message dropouts,neural nets,illegal fishing,learning (artificial intelligence),illegal activities,ships,automatic identification system,marine engineering,machine learning-assisted anomaly detection,maritime navigation,AIS transponders,"

"unseen annihilation: illegal fishing practices and nautical patrol","2023","A host of regulations should protect fish, a common-pool resource, from overexploitation, but detecting violations of these regulations is challenging, both at sea and in port. We present a novel approach to uncover a supposedly widespread and particularly harmful illegal fishing practice, the use of nets with illegally small mesh size. Our approach relies on readily available data on reported fish landings. We focus on bottom trawling, the world’s most widely used fishing method. We exploit the fact that using illegally small mesh size increases the share of small fish in the catch. Using quasi-random variation in nautical patrol as a source of variation in the incentive to comply, we show that in weeks without patrol the share of small fish in the landed catch is systematically larger than in adjacent weeks with patrol. Our results are in line with widespread use of illegally small mesh. The resulting catch and discard of juvenile fish is many times larger than the gain in the catch of marketable fish. This harm has thus far been largely ignored in estimates of the externalities from fishing.","Environmental economics,Fisheries,Enforcement,Regulation,"
"simultaneous data collection of small maritime targets using multistatic and forward scatter radar","2015","Radar detection of small maritime targets is of great interest in the context of coastal and port security for prevention of activities such as smuggling and piracy. Multistatic radar and forward scatter radar offer detection advantages compared with conventional monostatic systems, such as advantageous multi-perspective target view for the former and target radar cross section enhancement for the latter. In this paper, preliminary experimental results of simultaneous measurements to investigate the detection of a small inflatable boat by a multistatic and a forward scatter radar are presented. These results are believed to be the first example of simultaneous experimental comparison of such systems.","small inflatable boat detection,marine radar,low observable target,radar detection,Sea measurements,Radar scattering,small maritime target data collection,coastal security,object detection,port security,Context,Radar cross-sections,radar signal processing,Decision support systems,Maritime surveillance,multistatic radar,small maritime target radar detection,electromagnetic wave scattering,Radar detection,forward scatter radar,"
"contextual verification for false alarm reduction in maritime anomaly detection","2015","Automated vessel anomaly detection is immensely important for preventing and reducing illegal activities (e.g., drug dealing, human trafficking, etc.) and for effective emergency response and rescue in a country's territorial waters. A major limitation of previously proposed vessel anomaly detection techniques is the high rate of false alarms as these methods mainly consider vessel kinematic information which is generally obtained from AIS data. In many cases, an anomalous vessel in terms of kinematic data can be completely normal and legitimate if the 'context' at the location and time (e.g., weather and sea conditions) of the vessel is factored in. In this paper, we propose a novel anomalous vessel detection framework that utilizes such contextual information to reduce false alarms through 'contextual verification'. We evaluate our proposed framework for vessel anomaly detection using massive amount of real-life AIS data sets obtained from U.S. Coast Guard. Though our study and developed prototype is based on the maritime domain the basic idea of using contextual information through 'contextual verification' to filter false alarms can be applied to other domains as well.","Kinematics,AIS Data,emergency management,vessel kinematic information,Contextual Verification,Trajectory Clustering,Anomaly Detection,contextual verification,US coast guard,Meteorology,False Alarm Reduction,illegal activities,marine engineering,automated vessel anomaly detection,false alarms,Big data,contextual information,Context,false alarm reduction,maritime anomaly detection,Real-time systems,emergency response,Tracking,Trajectory,territorial waters,AIS data,"
"enhanced sismaris: (systã¨me d'information et de surveillance maritime etendu pour l'identification des comportements suspects): enhanced maritime surveillance and information system for abnormal behaviour identification","2010","The number of ships and the diversity of threat in maritime surveillance increase every day. Tracking and monitoring from the coast all type of ship on a common operational picture is no more sufficient. An Innovative solution shall be set up to support human operators in their permanent surveillance tasks in vulnerable trading lanes and zones in order to detect abnormal or illicit vessel behaviour and to understand and to early identify threatening situations. Displaying thousands of tracks on a single display has be demonstrated its inefficiency, in front of all the cases of illegal immigration, terrorism, drugs trafficking, smuggling, illegal fishing, pollution, etc... that were recorded this year. This future generation of maritime surveillance system must allow: 1) Permanent and all weather coverage of border maritime areas. 2) Continuous collection and fusion of heterogeneous data provided by various types of sensors deployed on coast and on mobile platforms and other information from external sources. 3) Supervised automatic detection of abnormal vessel behaviours (in track and performed activity) and generate justified alarms. 4) Understanding of suspicious events and early identification of threats from series of detected spatiotemporal abnormal vessel behaviours (alarms). 5) Generate electronic and formatted interpretation reports on the suspicious event to keep periodically informed decisional authorities. 6) Anticipate the operational response mobilizing and using means with the best efficiency as possible 7) To capitalize knowledge and work of each partner, within an inter-agencies and international framework, for a common benefit on a real time basis 8) To ensure the data protection respecting the respective rules of information sharing. No equipment and information system deployed are currently able to answer all these requirements together. However, in the horizon of 2015 significant technical progresses will be made in wide maritime area coverage detection and highlighting abnormal behaviors methodology that could be usefully used together to built up an new generation of sea border surveillance integrated system for efficient security applications in high density traffics. The objectives of the SISMARIS project are: 1) To build up a complete test system (end to end information acquisition and processing system). 2) To test new maritime surveillance sensors and other available intelligent information sources in order to obtain optimal maritime security awareness. 3) To demonstrate that this new information system will help the operator to analyze automatically a high density of tracks in order to highlight only the useful information, and detect some predefined behavior that could be abnormal or not. 4) To give the police authorities a helpful tool to collect and register evidences in order to prosecute usefully offenders. The objectives of the ESISMARIS project are to extend the coverage of detection of SISMARIS by including Satellite AIS across North Atlantic Ocean, and to evaluate a new innovative solution in the fight against drugs transfer between Central America and Europe.

"ais data visualization for maritime spatial planning (msp)","2016","The constant increase in marine traffic and the simultaneous growth of the demand for exploiting marine areas (e.g., installing offshore wind power plants) require an adequate planning strategy for managing high traffic volumes. Maritime Spatial Planning (MSP) is the process of public development of an allocation plan for distributing, both spatially and temporally, human activities in marine areas. The adoption of e-Navigation is a possible solution for improving safety and security at sea by integrating maritime information on board and ashore. Automatic Identification System (AIS) data represents a fundamental source of information, since the analysis of AIS data can highlight the presence of congested areas as well as of illegal actions, such as smuggling, pollution, and unauthorized phishing in protected areas. Indeed, those activities are often characterized by abnormal manoeuvres that can be recognized by analyzing the routes of the vessels. However, the huge dimension of the AIS data to process requires the adoption of careful strategies for the data visualization. In this paper, we present a complete pipeline for visualizing ship routes from raw AIS data, which is a fundamental pre-requisite for carrying out a significant AIS-based route analysis, and describe a real case study, where 90 million AIS records, corresponding to one month of world-wide observations, are visualized using only open-source software.","AIS data visualization,route analysis,intelligent transport systems,e-Navigation,AIS data,"

"on the effectiveness of ai-assisted anomaly detection methods in maritime navigation","2020","The automatic identification system (AIS) has become an essential tool for maritime security. Nevertheless, how to effectively use the static and dynamic voyage information of the AIS data in maritime traffic situation awareness is still a challenge. This paper presents a comparative study of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques on their effectiveness in dealing with various anomalies in maritime domain using the AIS data. The AIS on-off switching (OOS) anomaly is critical in maritime security, since AIS technology is susceptible to manipulation and it can be switched on and off to hide illegal activities. Thus, we try to detect and distinguish between intentional and non-intentional AIS OOS anomalies through our AI -assisted anomaly detection framework. We use AIS data, in particular positional and navigational status of vessels, to study the effectiveness of seven AI techniques, such as artificial neural network, support vector machine, logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, decision tree, random forest and naive Bayes, in detecting the AIS OOS anomalies. Our experimental results show that ANN and SVM are the most suitable techniques in detecting the AIS OOS anomalies with 99.9% accuracy. Interestingly, the ANN model outperforms others when trained with a balanced (i.e., same order of samples per class) dataset, and SVM, on the other hand, is suitable when training dataset is unbalanced.","maritime traffic situation awareness,AI-assisted anomaly detection,decision trees,Support vector machines,logistic regression,Anomaly detection,static voyage information,random forests,ANN,marine navigation,Feature extraction,security of data,maritime security,k-nearest neighbors,regression analysis,AIS technology,naive Bayes,neural nets,naive Bayes methods,automatic identification system,marine safety,marine engineering,support vector machines,maritime navigation,dynamic voyage information,maritime domain,random forest,SVM,Artificial intelligence,AIS on-off switching anomaly,nearest neighbour methods,artificial neural network,Training,Trajectory,support vector machine,nonintentional AIS OOS anomalies,Navigation,artificial intelligence,decision tree,AIS data,"
"enabling maritime risk assessment using natural language processing-based deep learning techniques","2020","Maritime vessels around the world risk encountering dangerous situations during their voyages such as piracy, kidnappings, hijackings, and smugglings. Such dangers may put crews at risk and potentially cause extensive damage to both the vessel and its cargo. Maritime risk assessment is a process of analyzing such factors to positively impact the safety and timeliness of operations. Analyzing the high-risk areas in seas and oceans can help vessels route around areas with previously recorded high levels of dangerous activities. This information is scraped and extracted from various maritime documents, including newspaper articles, social media, incident blogs, and operational reports. After textual data sources are parsed, it is possible to use this extracted information as training datasets into a Machine Learning (ML) model using Natural Language Processing (NLP) Deep Learning (DL) techniques. With these methods, we can perform document classification, risk extraction, text summarization, topic modeling, and information extraction in an automated manner. Methods that are used include the bag-of words (BOW) approach and, in particular, the use of Named Entity Recognition (NER) to identify specific areas around the world that are considered a risk to a particular voyage. Once this information is processed, the model can determine and aggregate specific areas of high-risk activity. We propose a Maritime Event Log (MEL) pipeline using DL methods. This pipeline includes binary document classification (DC) to extract positive instances of incidents, an incident type classification (IC,) and an information extraction module (IE) including date and location and ship type extraction. With such information available, it is possible to avoid dangerous situations, which may have a significant level of impact on the safety and success rate of maritime operations.","Bit error rate,Pipelines,newspaper articles,Text categorization,Hidden Markov models,deep learning (artificial intelligence),Information retrieval,machine learning model,maritime vessels,information retrieval,natural language processing,maritime risk assessment,safety,bag-of words approach,high-risk activity,information extraction module,ships,marine safety,marine engineering,maritime event log pipeline,vessels route,operational reports,ship type extraction,named entity recognition,risk management,pattern classification,incident type classification,Classification algorithms,maritime documents,text summarization,incident blogs,Training,risk extraction,textual data sources,text analysis,deep learning techniques,social media,maritime operations,binary document classification,topic modeling,"
"vessel detection and classification: an integrated maritime surveillance system in the tyrrhenian sea","2010","In recent years a number of organizations, both national and international, have put significant efforts in developing knowledge-based integrated maritime surveillance (IMS) systems. The final aim is to have a clear picture of the position, classification, identification and movement of cooperative and non-cooperative targets entering and leaving the 200 nautical miles limit of the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). Each sensor (i.e. satellite-based, ground-based, shipborne or airborne) has its own task and, in such a context, high frequency (HF) surface wave (SW) radars are inexpensive tools for long range early warning applications in open waters. They allow maximizing the effectiveness in dealing with fisheries protection, drug interdiction, illegal immigration, terrorist threats, search and rescue tasks. This paper focuses on the possibility of combining automatic identification system (AIS) data with HFSWR data for vessel detection and classification purposes. Three algorithms for target detection in compound Gaussian HF sea clutter are presented and their performance evaluated. The combined use of AIS plots provided by cooperative targets can allow the operator to discriminate non-cooperative targets and possible threats.

"iuu safe havens or psma ports: a global assessment of port state performance and risk","2023","The 2009 Port State Measures Agreement (PSMA) was the first legally binding international instrument to empower port States to deny foreign vessels suspected of having engaged in illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing from using their ports and to land catches. This paper builds upon previous work analyzing 2020 AIS data to rank fishing ports globally and assessing evolving port State risk and port States performance in PSMA implementation. Internal and external indicators were identified to highlight the port States at risk of becoming exposed to IUU fishing transactions. This paper includes an analysis of designated port use, a key requirement of PSMA implementation. The paper also establishes an ongoing methodological framework for port associated IUU risk assessment using the outputs as a benchmark against which follow-up trend analyses are planned, the next using 2023 data. Port rankings evolved because of continued AIS adoption, port State business diversification and Covid-19 related disruptions. 3% of commercial port calls globally are made by foreign vessels. Globally, internal port State risk has dropped, while external risk has increased, the former driven by parties to the PSMA, and the latter by PSMA non-parties. Higher-risk fleets are now diverting to PSMA non-parties. The findings underline the transformational nature of the Agreement. Overall port State risk correlates more strongly with quality of governance than with national income. The paper finds that the PSMA’s designated port entry rule for foreign vessels is currently weakly applied in advanced economies whilst it is more strongly applied across the developing world.","Port State performance,Illegal,unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing,Automatic identification system (AIS),Risk analysis,Ranking of fishing ports,Agreement on Port State Measures,"
"the effectiveness of dazzlers for maritime security","2010","A dazzler, sometimes called an optical distracter, transmits a visually intense light, usually in a narrow beam, in order to 1) attract the attention of a person and to make them alert to other visual or audible warnings against approaching a protected asset in a threatening manner, or 2) to suppress the actions of noncompliant persons (continued advance or aiming of weapons) by obscuring their vision with disability glare. Dazzlers feature in land operations, at military check points in non-combat land operations, to momentarily distract an assailant, to alert drivers in vehicles approaching a check point, and to alert civilian traffic to approaching forces. Dazzlers are being considered for maritime security; for port protection, counter piracy, and critical infrastructure protection to warn the occupants of small boats and for suppressing the vision of noncompliant persons who may be intent on attacking. The distances of initial detection and warning for maritime operations are generally much longer (on the order of 300 to 3000 m) than the distances in land operations (50 to 300 m). Dazzler aiming is furthermore likely to be under automatic control rather than handheld as in land operations, in order to more control dwell time against a distant contact, and to provide a large operator-dazzler separation for operator safety in counter piracy. The requirements for dazzler effectiveness therefore change when going from land operations to maritime. Models of disability glare are used here to model and study the effectiveness of dazzlers for maritime security across changing ambient light conditions, with aiming uncertainties, and for different types of sources (coherent lasers versus incoherent spotlights). Key requirements for specifying a dazzler system are considered.","dazzler effectiveness,Lighting,Safety,military equipment,Disability Glare,Optical Distractor,Spotlight,Maritme Security,maritime security,optical distracter,noncombat land operations,military check points,Response Measures,visually intense light,marine safety,disability glare,Humans,laser beam applications,Laser beams,Uncertainty,Weapons,Visualization,laser dazzler,security,Laser Dazzler,automatic control,"

The novel method developed to design AIS constellations leads to a candidate system relying on 8 satellites on 4 orbital planes which guarantee a ship location update of less than 1 hour and a mean time between EO images and AIS data retrieval of slightly less than 30 minutes.","Satellites,COSMO-SkyMed,ship traffic management,remote sensing,pollution measurement,EO constellations,Marine vehicles,Monitoring,illegal maritime operation identification,ships,maritime surveillance,Europe,Orbits,marine pollution,traffic control,artificial satellites,Imaging,automatic identification systems,marine control,Spaceborne radar,Mediterranean area,earth observing constellations,future space AIS systems,oceanographic techniques,"
"integrated maritime surveillance: protecting national sovereignty","2003","Protection of national sovereignty requires the ongoing, systematic collection of data from a range of sensors and other sources and the assembly and maintenance of a picture of the position, classification, identification and movement of cooperative and non-cooperative ships, aircraft and hazards in the exclusive economic zone. Integrated maritime surveillance maintains a continuous and affordable real-time picture of ship and aircraft tracks to beyond the 200 nautical mile limit of the EEZ using land based HF and microwave radar systems. The system associates ancillary data from other sources to provide a knowledge-based 'recognized maritime picture' and the most effective surveillance of all significant targets within the EEZ. Overlays of GIS referenced data such as sea-state, currents, ice, water temperature, phytoplankton, etc., can be included to support the deployment of air and surface assets and maximize their effectiveness in dealing with fisheries protection, drug interdiction, illegal immigration, terrorist threats, search and rescue and other aspects of national sovereignty.","aircraft,marine radar,air assets,illegal immigration,Aircraft,Marine vehicles,Sensor systems,integrated maritime surveillance,sea-state,Assembly systems,GIS referenced data,HF surface wave radar,terrorism,recognized maritime picture,Target tracking,terrorist threats,fisheries protection,search radar,national sovereignty,noncooperative ships,Radar tracking,Protection,geographic information systems,drug interdiction,Real time systems,currents,ice,microwave radar systems,search and rescue,Hazards,hazards,national security,phytoplankton,cooperative ships,Surveillance,EEZ limit,exclusive economic zone,surface assets,water temperature,"
"maritime awareness for counter-piracy in the gulf of aden","2011","Maritime awareness is a keystone of counter-piracy activities, as they are nowadays unfortunately called for in the Gulf of Aden and the Western Indian Ocean. There are a number of space-based systems that can be used to obtain knowledge of shipping and ship traffic patterns beyond coastal range, e.g. Satellite AIS, LRIT and satellite SAR. Based on data gathered during a trial in 2010, this paper analyses the capabilities of these systems when used to obtain a fused maritime picture. It is concluded that all data sources contribute to the maritime picture, but that in particular for Satellite AIS the update rates need to increase to enable accurate fusion of the non-cooperative data.","Counter-Piracy,Satellites,space-based system,counter piracy activity,marine radar,Marine vehicles,shipping knowledge,fused maritime picture,ship traffic pattern,Reliability,Sea measurements,Gulf of Aden,Accuracy,noncooperative data,ships,Maritime Surveillance,synthetic aperture radar,maritime awareness,Interpolation,Western Indian Ocean,coastal range,data source,Satellite AIS,satellite AIS,Surveillance,Satellite SAR,traffic,"
"outlier detection approach for discovering anomalous maritime profiles","2023","Maritime authorities play a key role in ensuring the safety and security of shipping lanes and ports. The port state control mechanism enables these authorities to physically verify suspect vessels (e.g., involved in smuggling or piracy events), but choosing the most relevant vessels to be inspected represents a challenging task. This decision can be enhanced by AI-powered systems that analyse large amounts of data, identify patterns and report all observed discrepancies. This paper presents a statistical analysis on the temporal durations of four types of naval statuses: sailing, docked in port, waiting at anchor and not transmitting AIS data. These durations were extracted from the historical activity of different classes of vessels that passed the Black Sea region (Romanian Exclusive Economic Zone) in 2022. Probability density functions were built for these vessels and all statuses' durations were fitted into known parametric distributions. Finally, the paper shows the results of multiple outlier detection algorithms that searched for anomalous data in a multivariate manner.","shipping lanes,probability density functions,Electric potential,Safety,unsupervised learning,naval statuses,public administration,Black Sea region,maritime authorities,outlier detection,Probability density function,temporal durations,port state control,statistical analysis,ships,port state control mechanism,marine safety,marine engineering,observed discrepancies,anomalous maritime profiles,AIS,Seaports,historical activity,Artificial intelligence,sea ports,maritime anomaly detection,Statistical analysis,anomalous data,smuggling,AIS data,Romanian exclusive economic zone,outlier detection approach,probability,AI-powered systems,Security,production engineering computing,data handling,suspect vessels,"

"automatic identification of maritime incidents from unstructured articles","2018","In this paper, we present two Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for identifying maritime incidents described in unstructured articles from multiple sources. The first technique is a document classification scheme that determines if an article describes a maritime incident. Two variations of each article are created: the first only contains the article's title, the other contains the title and content. These are converted to both binary and frequency bags-of-words. Furthermore, two feature selection methods are tested: Weka's CfsSubsetEval and retaining the 300 most frequent words. Each dataset is tested with 41 classifiers from the Weka suite, with the most accurate classifiers including Logistic Regression (98.5%), AdaBoostM1(BayesNet) (98.33%), and RandomForest (97.56%). The second technique performs information extraction on an article to determine the location of the maritime incident. In addition to using regular expressions and Named Entity Recognition (NER), the approach focuses its attention on sentences that contain piracy keywords as well as sentences which occur earlier in the article. In our testing, this approach achieved 87.9% accuracy. Together the two techniques form a pipeline where the positive examples from the document classification algorithm are fed into the information extraction algorithm.","Risk management,unstructured articles,information extraction algorithm,Natural Language Processing,Information retrieval,word processing,Conferences,Feature extraction,natural language processing,maritime risk assessment,regression analysis,automatic maritime incident identification,RandomForest,Weka suite classifiers,marine engineering,Logistic Regression,piracy keywords,feature extraction,pattern classification,risk management,random processes,Named Entity Recognition,feature selection,document classification,text analysis,Natural language processing,Task analysis,Weka CfsSubsetEval,Data mining,learning (artificial intelligence),binary bags-of-words,AdaBoostM1,frequency bags-of-words,"
"improving maritime situational awareness by fusing sensor information and intelligence","2011","In present-day military security operations threats are more difficult to reveal than in conventional warfare theatres, since they take place during the course of normal life. These maritime missions often take place in littoral environments, where acts of piracy, drug trafficking and other threatening events become obscured in the crowd of everyday fisheries, cargo traders, ferries and pleasure cruises, hindering situation awareness. We aim to improve situation awareness and threat detection capabilities in maritime scenarios by combining sensor-based information with context information and intelligence from various sources. The fusion and analysis in order to reveal suspect from normal behavior is based on domain ontologies. A test bed allows the study of various exploitation and assessments techniques applied to these domain ontologies. Using an appropriate scenario we have simulated suspect and normal behaviour to test the applicability of the various techniques.","Semantics,sensor fusion,ferries,cargo traders,situation awareness,Decision support,context information,military systems,drug trafficking,Situation awareness,maritime scenarios,domain ontologies,maritime situational awareness,littoral environments,Decision trees,Bayesian methods,Intelligence,threatening events,Context,sensor-based information,warfare theatres,Ontologies,everyday fisheries,threat detection capabilities,Context modeling,Sensors,Threat assessment,maritime missions,military security operations,Security,pleasure cruises,"
"toward the automated construction of probabilistic knowledge graphs for the maritime domain","2021","International maritime crime is becoming increasingly sophisticated, often associated with wider criminal networks. Detecting maritime threats by means of fusing data purely related to physical movement (i.e., those generated by physical sensors, or hard data) is not sufficient. This has led to research and development efforts aimed at combining hard data with other types of data (especially human-generated or soft data). Existing work often assumes that input soft data is available in a structured format, or is focused on extracting certain relevant entities or concepts to accompany or annotate hard data. Much less attention has been given to extracting the rich knowledge about the situations of interest implicitly embedded in the large amount of soft data existing in unstructured formats (such as intelligence reports and news articles). In order to exploit the potentially useful and rich information from such sources, it is necessary to extract not only the relevant entities and concepts, but also their semantic relations, together with the uncertainty associated with the extracted knowledge (i.e., in the form of probabilistic knowledge graphs). This will increase the accuracy of, and confidence in, the extracted knowledge and facilitate subsequent reasoning and learning. To this end, we propose Maritime DeepDive, an initial prototype for the automated construction of probabilistic knowledge graphs from natural language data for the maritime domain. In this paper, we report on the current implementation of Maritime DeepDive, together with preliminary results on extracting probabilistic events from maritime piracy incidents.

"improving group transit schemes to minimize negative effects of maritime piracy","2014","Contemporary maritime piracy around the Horn of Africa presents a serious threat to the global shipping industry. A number of countermeasures were deployed to minimize the probability of a successful ship hijack, one of them being the establishment of the International Recommended Transit Corridor (IRTC). Currently, all ships transiting the Gulf of Aden are recommended to follow the IRTC and take part in group transit schemes (GTSs)-prescribed fixed schedules stating a time of arrival to the beginning of the corridor and a speed at which to sail through the corridor. We provide a number of contributions that improve the GTS: we formalize the grouping problem, we design an efficient algorithm able to compute optimal fixed GTSs with respect to the distribution of ships' speeds, we provide a real-world data set with speeds of ships transiting the IRTC, and we compare the optimal fixed schedules with the currently deployed schedule and quantify possible savings. Additionally, we propose on-demand GTSs-customized schedules for a group of arriving ships-that take into account speeds, risk aversion, and actual positions of arriving ships. We formulate the problem of the optimal on-demand grouping as a biobjective mixed integer program, and we compute a set of Pareto optimal solutions.

"china's vessel security system under the background of the revision of maritime traffic safety law of the people's republic of china: connotation and development","2021","Since the 21st century, piracy, armed hijacking and terrorist attacks have occurred frequently, threatening the safety of international maritime transportation and the interests of shipping enterprises. Under such circumstance, in order to satisfy the requirements of shipping development and respond to the maritime threats, the Maritime Traffic Safety Law of the People's Republic of China (2021) has been revised based on the notion of rationality and feasibility. This paper analyses the Articles 12, 32 and 38 of the Maritime Traffic Safety Law of the People's Republic of China (2021), which jointly constitute the legal basis of China's vessel security system. Such security system is applicable to the coastal waters under the jurisdiction of China, international ships of Chinese nationality and related maritime safety activities. We find the security system not only protects the safety of China's maritime transport activities, but also provides certain protection for the interests of shipping enterprises in various countries. At present, the provisions of the MTSL for the vessel security system are relatively general. To implement security vessel system in the future, China may refer to other countries' legislation and state practice to further apply these articles.","Transportation,Legislation,Safety,international maritime transportation,transportation,Sea measurements,marine systems,maritime transport activities,ships,marine safety,vessel security system,government policies,piracy,security vessel system,People's Republic of China,shipping enterprises,vessel security,legislation,terrorist attacks,country legislation,Maritime Traffic Safety Law,armed hijacking,Security,Terrorism,Law,maritime safety,"

"analysis and design of cubesat constellation for the mediterranean south costal monitoring against illegal immigration","2018","Costal monitoring is focused on fast response to illegal immigration and illegal ship traffic. Especially, the illegal ship traffic has been present in media since April 2015, as the number of reported deaths of immigrants crossing the Mediterranean significantly increased. Satellite images provide a possibility to at least partially control both types of events. This paper defines the principal criteria to select the best satellite constellation architecture for maritime and coastal monitoring, filling the gaps of imagery techniques in term of real-time control. The primary purpose of a constellation is to obtain global measurement improving the temporal resolution. The small size and low-cost are the main factors, which make CubeSats ideal for use in constellations. We propose a constellation of 9 Cubesats distributed evenly in 3 different planes. This reduces the revisit time enhancing the coverage duration. In addition, it also allows observing fire, damage on building and similar disasters. In this analysis, the performance criteria were reported such as the revisit time, the vision duration and the area coverage.","Revisit time,CubeSat,Constellation,Coverage,"
"a risk assessment and alerting system for maritime attacks","2014","The impact of piracy on the maritime economy has been increasing dramatically over the last decade, which encouraged actors of maritime security to support research works on detection and protection against this threat. However, providing automated support for attacks in the maritime domain is highly dependent on the context and on the information available to the system. In this paper, we present an algorithmic module and its underlying rule-based risk model, designed to detect abnormal behaviours such as maritime attacks from heterogeneous sources of information.

"maritime smuggling detection and mitigation using risk-aware hybrid robotic sensor networks","2017","With the rise of more resourceful unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), their inclusion into robotic sensor networks (RSNs) is inevitable. The highly mobile nature of UAVs allows greater monitoring capabilities, making them most suitable for RSNs. Compared to traditional nodes in RSNs, UAVs suffer even more from communication disruptions and energy depletion, must often rapidly determine actions for themselves, and consequently require more autonomy. Prior work has been done in wireless sensor network (WSN)/aerial sensor network (ASN) coordination in a few applications such as protecting critical infrastructure, restoring communication between nodes, and healing networks, while other work has been accomplished on using the UAV network for augmenting the monitoring capabilities of WSNs. We introduce a novel methodology to integrate UAVs into RSNs for monitoring purposes by formulating the problem in the context of a risk management framework (RMF). This methodology allows a more precise risk feature classification and a more efficient task allocation for the ground network by utilizing the monitoring capabilities of the UAVs to informatively warn the RSN of any incoming events. We also present a fictitious but credible maritime smuggling scenario near the Port of Barcelona based on expert knowledge, and apply the methodology to detect and mitigate maritime smuggling. The network's behaviour is traced throughout the scenario and is repeated with civilian ships to assure that they are not flagged as smugglers.

This work presents a data-driven non-parametric Bayesian model, based on Gaussian Processes, to model normal shipping behaviour. This model is learned from Automatic Identification System (AIS) data and uses an Active Learning paradigm to select an informative subsample of the data to reduce the computational complexity of training. The resultant model allows a measure of normality to be calculated for each newly-observed transmission according to its velocity given its current latitude and longitude. Using this measure of normality, ships can be identified as potentially anomalous and prioritised for further investigation. The model performance is assessed by its ability to detect artificially generated AIS anomalies at locations around the United Kingdom.

"ais-based maritime anomaly traffic detection: a review","2023","Maritime transportation plays an essential role in global trade. Due to the huge number of vessels worldwide, there is also a non-negligible volume of Maritime incidents such as collisions/sinking and illegal events (e.g., piracy, smuggling, and unauthorized fishing). Electronic equipment/systems, such as radars and Automatic Identification Systems (AIS), have contributed to improving maritime situational awareness. AIS provides one of the fundamental sources of vessel kinematics and static data. Today, many approaches are focused on automatically detecting the vessels’ traffic behavior and discovering useful patterns and deviations from those data. These studies contribute to detecting suspicious activities and anomalous trajectories, whose developed techniques could be applied in the surveillance systems, helping the authorities to anticipate proper actions. Several concerns and difficulties are involved in the analyses of vessel kinematics data: how to deal with big data generated, inconsistencies, irregular updates, dynamic data, unlabeled data, and evaluation. This article presents the approaches, constraints, and challenges in maritime traffic anomaly detection research, presenting a review, a taxonomy, and a discussion of the proposed approaches.","Automatic Identification System (AIS),Vessel movements patterns,Maritime surveillance systems,Anomaly detection,Maritime traffic anomalous behavior,"
"designing intelligent coastal surveillance based on big maritime data","2020","The ocean is classified into several territorial regimes that span from internal waters, archipelagic waters, territorial seas, contiguous zones, exclusive economic zones (EEZ), and high seas. The relevant state authorities must perform surveillance of all ships that navigate through their respective territories to ensure the ship safety and prevent them from carrying out illegal activities such as illegal unregulated and unreported (IUU) fishing, illegal firearms smuggling, and piracy. Currently, maritime domain surveillance is carried out using a combination of Automatic Identification System (AIS), Coastal Radar System (CRS), and Long Range Camera (LRC). The massive amount of incoming data from these surveillance systems produce big maritime data. However, big maritime data is useless without artificial intelligence intervention. This research proposed an intelligent system that provides and analyzes ship path planning, identifies suspicious ships, track ships, and approaches and attacks target ships using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm.

"maritime situation analysis: a multi-vessel interaction and anomaly detection framework","2014","Maritime security is critical for protecting sea lanes, ports, harborsand other critical infrastructure against a broad range of threats and illegal activities like smuggling, human trafficking, piracy and terrorism. Limited resources constrain maritime domain awareness and compromise full security coverage at all times. This situation calls for innovative intelligent systems for interactive situation analysis to assist marine authorities and security personal in their routine surveillance operations. In this paper, we propose a novel situation analysis approach to analyze, detect and differentiate a range of interaction patterns and anomalies of interest for marine vessels that operate over some period of time in relative proximity to each other. We analyze vessel interaction scenarios to model common patterns as probabilistic processes in terms of hidden Markov models. To differentiate suspicious activities from unobjectionable behavior, we explore fusion of data and information from observable behavior (geospatial aspects, kinematic features and contextual information) and maritime domain knowledge from diverse sources.

"global route choice and its modelling of dry bulk carriers based on vessel movement database: focusing on the suez canal","2017","This paper addresses global route choices for dry bulk carriers, focusing on the competitive situation between the Suez Canal (SC) and its competitors, such as the Panama Canal (PC) and the route via the Cape of Good Hope. The authors first establish a methodology and estimate the actual route choices for dry bulk carriers based on a vessel movement database, focusing on the share of SC transit for each pair of regions where the cargo originates and is destined to. Second, an aggregated logit model is applied to predict the estimated shares by regional pair and is utilised in sensitivity analyses for simulations that consider the recent changes in the dry bulk shipping market such as the PC's expansion, the decline in bunker prices, and the suppression of Somali piracy risk. The results suggest that the proposed methodology is useful for estimating the share of SC transit by regional pair and that the model for describing route choice is validated through not only output indices such as prediction rate but also sensitivity analyses, a time transferability check, and a comparison with the results of a shortest-path model.","Logit model,Vessel movement data,Global route choice,Suez Canal,Dry bulk carrier,"
"deep learning to enhance maritime situation awareness","2019","Maritime surveillance sensors like AIS (Automatic Identification System) and Radar provide useful information for decision-making support, which is of paramount importance for effective operations against maritime threats and illegal activities [1]. However, decision-making systems that trust solely on AIS information tend to fail in real situations because such information could be missing, inaccurate or even deceptive [2]. On the other hand, only Radar information is not enough to get a complete description of the maritime situational picture. This paper proposes a deep learning framework for vessel monitoring that examines a particular scenario where a deep learning solution can infer a navigation status based on the vessels trajectories, and thus to detect suspicious vessels activities. For this purpose, a dataset, named DeepMarine, has been specifically created by collecting data of AIS historical recordings. We demonstrate the performance of the developed deep learning framework for the proposed vessels activity classification, which can be ultimately used to report illegal activities.","decision support systems,surveillance,sensor fusion,marine radar,maritime situation,decision-making systems,Anomaly detection,vessel activity classification,deep learning solution,marine navigation,maritime threats,navigation status,neural nets,military computing,illegal activities,DeepMarine,automatic identification system,marine safety,AIS historical recordings,Databases,radar information,pattern classification,vessel trajectories,maritime situational picture,Radar,decision-making support,suspicious vessel activities,deep learning framework,Trajectory,Deep learning,AIS information,Navigation,marine vehicles,vessel monitoring,learning (artificial intelligence),data handling,maritime surveillance sensors,"

"tracing illegal oil discharges from vessels using sar and ais in bohai sea of china","2021","In China's 14th Five-Year Plan, it is necessary to coordinate the promotion of marine ecological protection and prevent environmental risks such as marine oil spills. The illegal discharge of oily waste from ships is an important source of oil spill pollution in the Bohai Sea, and has become an important factor hindering the purification of the marine environment. Because SAR remote sensing is not restricted by light conditions, it can work at night, in heavy fog, overcast and rainy days, and has become one of the important techniques for monitoring oil spills on the sea. AIS can provide real-time and historical position and track information of ships. The combination of SAR and AIS can provide a great help for maritime regulatory authorities to find the source of oil spill pollution. However, China has not yet established a mature and effective oil spill supervision system based on SAR and AIS. This paper proposes a framework for oil spill detection and accountability using the combination of SAR, AIS and boarding inspection, and takes an example of the monitoring and tracking process of illegal oil discharge from a ship in the Bohai Sea. As far as we know, this is the first time that China has used SAR and AIS to identify ships that illegally discharge oily sewage. This work framework can provide a reference for China's maritime agencies to improve the oil spill supervision system during the 14th Five-Year Plan.","Synthetic aperture radar,Illegal discharge,Automatic identification system,Oil spill,"
"making sense of heterogeneous maritime data","2022","While an abundance of real-time maritime information exists and is readily available to monitoring authorities, there are still many instances in which ships are found to be engaged in dangerous or illegal activities. In order to prevent such activities, authorities employ Vessel Traffic Services systems since they promote safety at sea while also assisting in management of ports. In this paper we report on research done in cooperation with Denbridge Marine Ltd., a global provider of maritime solutions, and present an application integrated in a Vessel Tracking Services system that allows the detection of normal vessel activity as well as dangerous or illegal situations in real-time, using information from the Automatic Identification System, a radar sensor and other information.

"vc-gan: classifying vessel types by maritime trajectories using generative adversarial networks","2020","As maritime transport is the backbone of global trade, it is important to ensure the safety and security for sea transportation effectively. However, the dependence on experienced human operators for maritime surveillance does not scale in terms of coverage. While the ship information and trajectory data from the Automatic Identification System (AIS) can be used to automate maritime surveillance, the AIS data may be modified deliberately or accidentally, resulting in difficulties in the detection of illegal maritime activities. We have developed VC-GAN for Vessel Classification using Generative Adversarial Networks to identify vessel types based solely on the vessel trajectories in areas of interest. Our VC-GAN framework adversarially trains a multi-class classifier by learning from the labelled AIS data to classify the types of the vessels of interest, as well as to detect the out-of-class vessels.

The maritime axis is a strategic idea which embodied to ensure inter-island connectivity, shipping and fishery industries development, marine transportation improvement and focus on maritime security. So maritime monitoring is crucial in order to prevent sea pollution, fish theft, sovereignty offenses, territorial disputes, and piracy. Nowadays, maritime monitoring has been a very interesting issue over the last decade. With the rapid advancement of technology and the Internet, sensor network technology has become very important in monitoring the aquatic environment. Maritime responsibilities, such as vigilance and patrolling, wildlife monitoring, and aqua-culture inspection, mostly require large operational teams and expensive equipment.

"satellite cns for maritime transportation augmentation system (mtas)","2009","The development of the MTAS was to identify the possible applications for enhancement of digital selective call (DCS) MF/HF/VHF radio; satellite communications, navigation and surveillance (CNS); GPS and GLONASS; and safety systems including security and control of vessels, logistic and freight at sea, on inland waters and the security of crew and passengers on board ships, cruisers, boats and hovercrafts. These enhancements include many applications for the better management and operation of vessels and they are needed more than ever because of world merchant fleet expansion. Just the top 20 world ships registers have about 40,000 units under their national flags. Above all, the biggest problem today is that merchant ships and their crews are targets of the types of crime traditionally associated with the maritime industries, such as piracy, robbery and recently, a target for terrorist attacks. Thus, IMO and flag states will have a vital role in developing International Ship and Port Security (ISPS). The best way to implement ISPS is to design an Approaching and Port Control System (APCS) by special code augmentation satellite CNS including tracking and monitoring of all vehicle circulation in and out of the port area. The establishment of MTAS as a part of Global Satellite Augmentation Systems (GSAS) or GNSS-1, such as the US WAAS, European EGNOS, Japanese MSAS, Chinese SNAS, Indian GAGAN and future GSAS including African Satellite Augmentation System (ASAS) will meet all these requirements and will complement the services already provided by DGPS or Local VHF Augmentation System (LVAS) and MF radio beacons.","satellite CNS,MTAS,APCS,port area,Satellite navigation systems,Transportation,hovercrafts,US WAAS,Communication system security,GLONASS,GSAS,ISPS,Marine vehicles,Global Positioning System,European EGNOS,navigation and surveillance,Radio navigation,African satellite augmentation system,Satellite communication,crew security,marine safety,satellite navigation,cruisers,maritime transportation augmentation system,International Ship and Port Security,boats,Distributed control,Chinese SNAS,GPS,Satellite broadcasting,GNSS-1,safety systems,world merchant fleet expansion,Indian GAGAN,satellite communications,mobile satellite communication,Global Satellite Augmentation Systems,marine communication,Approaching and Port Control System,Control systems,board ships,terrorist attacks,special code augmentation satellite CNS,marine vehicles,Japanese MSAS,local VHF augmentation system,MF radio beacons,digital selective call,"

The historical radar data is mined by the cell-based method, unsupervised machine learning to obtain the vessel normal moving speeds in the monitoring area. Then a logic rule is applied to detect the abnormal targets. The proposed method is tested with real data from a coastal surveillance radar.

"maritime situation analysis framework: vessel interaction classification and anomaly detection","2015","Maritime domain awareness is critical for protecting sea lanes, ports, harbors, offshore structures like oil and gas rigs and other types of critical infrastructure against common threats and illegal activities. Typical examples range from smuggling of drugs and weapons, human trafficking and piracy all the way to terror attacks. Limited surveillance resources constrain maritime domain awareness and compromise full security coverage at all times. This situation calls for innovative intelligent systems for interactive situation analysis to assist marine authorities and security personal in their routine surveillance operations. In this article, we propose a novel situation analysis approach to analyze marine traffic data and differentiate various scenarios of vessel engagement for the purpose of detecting anomalies of interest for marine vessels that operate over some period of time in relative proximity to each other. We consider such scenarios as probabilistic processes and analyze complex vessel trajectories using machine learning to model common patterns. Specifically, we represent patterns as left-to-right Hidden Markov Models and classify them using Support Vector Machines.

"context-based models to overcome operational challenges in maritime security","2015","Piracy and smuggling are major international problems which not only threaten maritime security but also affect the global economy. Even though NATO and international forces have been relentlessly fighting maritime crime in East Africa (Gulf of Aden), the problems still persist and maritime crime has moved to West Africa (Gulf of Guinea). In the same vein, the Joint Interagency Task Force-South (JIATF-S) has had substantial operational success, controlling the vast geographical spread of smugglers in the East Pacific and Caribbean Sea. Due to limited number of maritime assets available, every resource needs to be efficiently allocated, both in time and space. This poses a great operational challenge requiring the integration and fusion of disparate information relevant to the mission and dynamic allocation of resources under uncertainty. Operational planning and execution for counter-smuggling and counter-piracy operations involve surveillance (to search, detect, track and identify potential threats) and interdiction operations (to intercept, investigate and potentially apprehend the suspects) in a dynamic and uncertain mission environment. In this paper, we present context-based models for counter-smuggling and counter-piracy missions, where the smuggling and piracy activities are represented in the form of color coded heat maps built using Intelligence information (INTEL), meteorological and oceanographic (METOC) information and other mission-specific attributes (sensor observations, target types and their behavior, etc.); these maps are interpreted as probability of activity (PoA) surfaces.

"a novel bias-tsp algorithm for maritime patrol","2023","This work aims to develop a search planning strategy to be used by a drone equipped with an inverse synthetic-aperture radar (ISAR) and an electro-optical sensor. After describing the specifics of our maritime scenario, we discuss four methodologies that can be used to find vessels involved in illegal fishing activities as quickly as possible. In addition to the clustering of the vessels, determined by the droneâ€™s electro-optical sensor range, we introduce a novel technique to bias a traveling salesman problem (TSP) tour. This bias is based on deliberately increasing distances to vessels that are classified as probable fishing vessels. This increase in distance is meant to prioritize visits to probable fishing vessels. Vessels are classified based on their length. The classification result and the vessel clustering are available before the actual planning of the tour. Simulations of scenarios in which we have a few vessels fishing illegally show that the novel technique, the bias-TSP, combined with a tour orientation based on operational considerations, outperforms the classic TSP: the mean distance traveled to find all the vessels involved in illegal fishing activities is reduced by at least 35â€“50%.

"data-driven fraud detection in international shipping","2018","Document fraud constitutes a growing problem in international shipping. Shipping documentation may be deliberately manipulated to avoid shipping restrictions or customs duties. Well-known examples of such fraud are miscoding and smuggling. These are cases in which the documentation of a shipment does not correctly or entirely describe the goods in transit. In an attempt to reduce the risks of document fraud, shipping companies and customs authorities typically perform random audits to check the accompanying documentation of shipments. Although these audits detect many fraud schemes, they are quite labor intensive and do not scale to the massive amounts of cargo that is shipped each day. This paper investigates whether intelligent fraud detection systems can improve the detection of miscoding and smuggling by analyzing large sets of historical shipment data. We develop a Bayesian network that predicts the presence of goods on the cargo list of shipments. The predictions of the Bayesian network are compared with the accompanying documentation of a shipment to determine whether document fraud is perpetrated. We also show how a set of discriminative models can be derived from the topology of the Bayesian network and perform the same fraud detection task. Our experimental results show that intelligent fraud detection systems can considerably improve the detection of miscoding and smuggling compared to random audits.","Neural networks,International shipping,Fraud detection,Logistic regression,Bayesian networks,Probablistic classification,"

An integrated maritime surveillance (IMS) system, based on high-frequency surface wave radars (HFSWR), for monitoring surface and low-level air activity within the 200 nautical mile (nm) Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) is described in this two-part paper. The science behind the long-range performance of HFSWR was presented in Part 1(Sevgi et al. 2001). The system described was installed on Canada's east coast, where it is being used to demonstrate continuous, all-weather surveillance of the EEZ to beyond 200 nm. The system consists of two land-based HFSWRs and an operations control center (OCC). The two unmanned radars provide coverage of the Grand Banks region of Newfoundland, renowned for its offshore resources, particularly fish and oil. The system has been designed to assist authorities to more efficiently monitor such illegal activities as drug trafficking, smuggling, piracy, illicit fishing and illegal immigration. In addition, the system may be used for tracking icebergs, environmental protection, search and rescue, resource protection, sovereignty monitoring, and remote sensing of ocean surface currents and winds. Extensive performance testing of the system has been conducted using the two fully functional radars. It is shown that the HFSWR system complements existing surveillance assets to dramatically increase the effectiveness of air and surface reconnaissance missions by vectoring them directly to targets of interest.","unmanned radars,operations control center,marine radar,remote sensing,operational status,IMS system,long-range performance,radar detection,illegal immigration,Surface waves,Canada,sovereignty monitoring,illicit fishing,Environmental economics,drug trafficking,Petroleum,surface air activity,Exclusive Economic Zone,Grand Banks region,reconnaissance missions,Atlantic Ocean,illegal activities,tracking,icebergs,environmental protection,Remote monitoring,continuous all-weather surveillance,high-frequency surface-wave radars,integrated maritime surveillance system,Sea surface,search radar,low-level air activity,EEZ,piracy,Protection,Radar,system performance,winds,smuggling,radar tracking,Newfoundland,search and rescue,ocean surface currents,Doppler radar,3 to 6 MHz,OCC,Control systems,resource protection,Surveillance,HFSWR,remote sensing by radar,Marine animals,"

The benefits of the architecture are highlighted for an illegal immigration scenario.","sensor fusion,object observation fusion,object-oriented world model,maritime picture,maritime domain awareness,Planning,object-oriented sensor data fusion,maritime security,heterogeneous sensors,situation awareness level,object-oriented methods,marine engineering,maritime surveillance,Data models,simulation tool,surveillance system,illegal immigration scenario,Object oriented modeling,Unmanned aerial vehicles,maritime environment,Boats,Surveillance,object-oriented approach,"
"classification of small boats in infrared images for maritime surveillance","2010","Autonomous round-the-clock observation of wide critical maritime areas can be a powerful support for border protection agencies to avoid criminal acts like illegal immigration, piracy or drug trafficking. These criminal acts are often accomplished by using small boats to decrease the probability of being uncovered. In this paper, we present an image exploitation approach to detect and classify maritime objects in infrared image sequences recorded from an autonomous platform. We focus on high robustness and generality with respect to variations of boat appearance, image quality, and environmental condition. A fusion of three different detection algorithms is performed to create reliable alarm hypotheses. In the following, a set of well-investigated features is extracted from the alarm hypotheses and evaluated using a two-stage-classification with support vector machines (SVMs) in order to distinguish between three object classes: clutter, irrelevant objects and suspicious boats. On the given image data we achieve a rate of 97% correct classifications.","infrared image sequences,suspicious boats,border protection,Support vector machines,radar clutter,illegal immigration,Feature extraction,drug trafficking,environmental condition,support vector machines,maritime surveillance,search radar,small boat classification,piracy,image quality,clutter,Histograms,Training,infrared imaging,image sequences,Boats,marine communication,Clutter,"
"a stackelberg game-theoretical approach to maritime counter-piracy","2019","In this paper, we provide a maritime counter-piracy framework to represent the strategies put in place and the interaction between a set of actors (patrollers and attackers) in a wide maritime scenario. Specifically, we model the interaction between patrollers and attackers in terms of a Stackelberg leader-follower game. With respect to the previous literature, we provide several innovations, in that we consider moving targets. Moreover, we let the attackers and patrollers ground their decisions not only on the current situation, but also on the expected evolution in the short or medium term. This is done by introducing in the payoff functions some projection terms, i.e., elements able to consider the future evolution of the scenario, up to a specified time window horizon. We conclude this paper with a simulation campaign considering a realistic test bed settled in the Gulf of Aden. Our experiments show that such a prediction is quite effective in generating better decisions allowing the patrollers to dynamically change targets. However, if the time horizon considered in the projection term is too large, we observe that the patrollers tend to patrol the area rather than focusing on specific vessels, and the resulting protection strategy has reduced effectiveness.","wide maritime scenario,moving targets,Bayes methods,specified time window horizon,Games,Stackelberg game-theoretical approach,Game theory,game theory,counter-piracy,maritime counter-piracy framework,Iris,future evolution,Antiterrorism,patrolling,defense strategy,Stackelberg leader-follower game,projection,Airports,Terrorism,"
"experimental comparison of ad hoc methods for classification of maritime vessels based on real-life ais data","2018","Classification of Maritime Vessels is a recurrent task in maritime surveillance systems. Classification can be conducted by different methods, e.g., NaÃ¯ve Bayes, k Nearest Neighbor, Decision Tree, Fuzzy Rule, or Neural Networks. The Automatic Identification System (AIS) is cooperative system of VHF-radio data exchange. By broadcasting of navigational data and ships' information it supports maritime safety, surveillance, and information. Based on measured AIS datasets of five maritime hotspots, easily implementable standard classification (i.e. ad hoc) methods from Data Science are compared to each other. These are evaluated in terms of accuracy. This experimental evaluation is motivated by the following question: Tip to which degree properties and behavior, e.g., vessel's type, can be detected by using large quantities of ship's positional, motion, and dimensions' data as provided by AIS? Future applications might include detection of fraudulent self-declarations of types, e.g., during illegal fishing activities.","surveillance,maritime surveillances systems,Fuzzy Rule,Nearest Neighbor,maritime vessels,Neural networks,Data Science,experimental comparison,Decision Tree,Decision trees,Neural Network,ad hoc methods,real-life AIS data,ships,marine safety,marine engineering,Automatic Identification System,AIS,Ions,pattern classification,NaÃ¯ve Bayes,Artificial intelligence,navigational data,maritime surveillance systems,Training,maritime hotspots,VHF radio propagation,KNIME Analytics Platform,VHF-radio data exchange,radio data systems,Surveillance,Classification,accuracy,Task analysis,performance evaluation,maritime safety,"
"automated monitoring in maritime video surveillance system","2020","Maritime surveillance for intruders/illegal activities requires monitoring of a large area of the coastline. This task being manually exhaustive, would benefit immensely by application of object detection techniques to surveillance videos. However, object detection models trained on general objects datasets cannot be expected to give best performance for this scenario as marine vessels are only a small subset of these huge datasets and also do not classify the specific type of sea vehicle. Hence, their benchmarks are not appropriate for maritime surveillance. Some studies have been done with applications of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for ship/boat detection on private and publicly available sea vessels datasets. This paper presents a summary of the benchmarks so far and presents our experiments of the latest object detection techniques for combined marine vessels dataset. A survey of the currently available datasets is also given. Results of our experiments in terms of mean Average Precision (mAP) and Frames Per Second (FPS) are presented.","Benchmark testing,object detection models,surveillance videos,sea vehicle,computerised monitoring,Meteorology,Videos,ships,marine engineering,Marine vessel identification,boats,object detection,Intruder detection,Video surveillance,convolutional neural nets,convolutional neural networks,general objects datasets,private sea vessels datasets,automated monitoring,Ship detection,Deep learning,Object detection,Computational modeling,Task analysis,video surveillance,marine vessels dataset,maritime video surveillance,"
"technologies to aid decision making for maritime security","2012","The paper presents 3 key technologies used in an integrated maritime reasoning and monitoring system [1]. These technologies fuse maritime data for decision support in the martime security domain. They support monitoring of scenarios of interest such as terrorist attacks or piracy incidents, and alert operators when such scenarios are assessed likely to happen. These 3 technologies are: a. Dynamic Bayesian Reasoning & Advanced Intelligent Networks (D'Brain), a reasoning system based on Bayesian networks. Causal and probabilistic information about scenarios of interest are structured as Bayesian networks, in which variables are set according to the interpretation of incoming situation information. The system thus provides a systematic approach to modelling and monitoring for scenarios of interest in the maritime situation. b. Graylist Ranking, a ranking technique to order entities based on their structural relationship with black-listed entities. The ranked list of entities could then be used to prioritize further investigation efforts into higher ranking entities which are considered more suspicious. c. Trajectory Analysis using a nonparametric Bayesian model, Dual Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes (Dual-HDP) [2]. It models the activity patterns (norm) of entities in motion. With the norm established, anomaly detection could be performed by evaluating how much each track deviates from the norm.","systematic approach,Dynamic Reasoning,trajectory analysis,sensor fusion,operator alerts,entity list ranking,causal information,situation information,black-listed entity ordering,anomaly detection,Anomaly Detection,Monitoring,maritime data fusion,belief networks,Knowledge engineering,computerised monitoring,Noise measurement,Scenario Modeling,entity activity pattern norm,martime security domain,Bayesian methods,structural relationship,marine safety,Cognitive science,marine engineering,D'Brain,nonparametric statistics,nonparametric Bayesian model,probabilistic information,Relationship Analysis,integrated maritime monitoring system,decision making,Trending,Graylist ranking technique,inference mechanisms,intelligent networks,probability,dual-HDP,dynamic Bayesian reasoning-and-advanced intelligent networks,Cognition,Computational modeling,terrorist attacks,dual-hierarchical Dirichlet processes,scenario-of-interest,decision support,integrated maritime reasoning system,piracy incidents,"
