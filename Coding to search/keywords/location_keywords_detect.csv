"online detection of anomaly behaviors based on multidimensional trajectories","2020","In the surveillance domain, timely detection of anomaly behaviors is very important and is a great challenge to human operators due to information overload, fatigue and inattention. Many anomaly detection algorithms based on trajectories have been proposed for this problem. However, these algorithms generally have problems such as complex parameter setting, unfaithful statistical model, not well-calibrated false alarm rate, poor ability of online learning and sequential anomaly detection, etc. The theory of conformal prediction was introduced to solve these problems by constructing the sequential Hausdorff nearest neighbor conformal anomaly detector. Yet, it only considers position information of the targets and is not sensitive to velocity and course anomaly behaviors. And the run times are increasing as the increase of the data size, which is not appropriate for early warning surveillance application. In order to solve these problems, sequential multi-factor Hausdorff nearest neighbor conformal anomaly detector (SMFHNNCAD) and sequential multi-factor Hausdorff nearest neighbor inductive conformal anomaly detector (SMFHNNICAD) based on multidimensional trajectories are proposed in this paper. Experiments in both simulated military scenario and realistic civilian scenario show the presented algorithm has a good performance to online detect anomaly behaviors and would have a wide prospect in early warning surveillance systems.","Multidimensional,Anomaly behavior,Trajectory,Online detection,"
"motion modeling and simulation of maritime autonomous surface ships in realistic environmental disturbances","2020","A novel modeling and simulation pipeline is proposed in this paper to predict the six-degrees-of-freedom (6-DOF) motion of MASS under realistic environmental disturbances. The MASS model consists of several physics-based differential equations that are built based on state-of-the-art studies. The onboard sensors are utilized to drive the MASS model to keep the consistent control input with the real ships. A build-in hydrodynamic database describes the motion characteristics of ships. Moreover, an actual sea database is developed based on the third-generation wave numerical model to reproduce the ocean characteristics in the simulation. The spatial-and time-varying environmental vector fields are obtained from the real sea database to ensure consistency with the real environment. Three real voyage cases are reproduced by the presented method. The simulation results are compared with the records from onboard sensors for validation. The RMSE of the simulated trajectories is 3.789', 3.110', and 1.318' under the single influence of disturbances due to the inappropriate description of the real sea. Under the coupling disturbances, the RMSE of trajectories reduces to 0.1829', 0.5249', and 0.4030'. Consequently, the results indicate that the ocean database accurately reflected the ocean characteristics realistically, and the presented method can effectively predict the motions of the real ship under the actual sea environmental disturbances.","onboard sensors,control system synthesis,state-of-the-art studies,third-generation wave numerical model,remotely operated vehicles,maritime autonomous surface ships,Marine vehicles,ship,Mathematical model,coupling disturbances,simulated trajectories,spatial- time-varying environmental vector fields,Predictive models,realistic environmental disturbances,ships,differential equations,hydrodynamic database,hydrodynamics,motion control,Databases,Oceans,position control,ocean database,motion modeling,motion characteristics,actual sea environmental disturbances,physics-based differential equations,Hydrodynamics,Numerical models,time series,six-degrees-of-freedom,actual sea database,mobile robots,MASS model,marine control,numerical analysis,consistent control input,ocean characteristics,"
"maritime anomaly detection in a real-world scenario: ever given grounding in the suez canal","2022","In this paper we present how automatic maritime anomaly detection tools can be successfully applied in real-world situations such as the major event of the container vessel Ever Given, which grounded in the Suez Canal on March 23rd 2021. The anomaly detector is designed to process the available sequence of Automatic Identification System (AIS) reports, information from ground-based or satellite radar systems if available, and contextual information defining the expected nominal behavior of navigation. A statistical hypothesis testing procedure is sequentially run to decide whether or not a deviation from the nominal behavior happened within a specific time period, for instance two consecutive data points. We show, based on the recorded AIS data from the Ever Given, that the proposed detector could have been triggered and alerted to anomalous behavior fully 19 minutes before the grounding.","anomaly detector,Anomaly detection,Marine vehicles,Grounding,statistical hypothesis testing,Ever Given grounding,automatic maritime anomaly detection tools,statistical analysis,Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process,Testing,ships,Containers,automatic identification system,radar,maritime surveillance,satellite radar systems,contextual information,container vessel,Suez Canal,Artificial intelligence,ground-based system,marine engineering computing,Maritime anomaly detection,Irrigation,statistical hypothesis testing procedure,expected nominal behavior,AIS data,"
"function-shape-based particle swarm optimization and its application in maritime static target cooperative search","2017","The application of particle swarm algorithm in optimization has been growing over the last few years, but this approach becomes computationally impracticable when the complexity of the problem increases. In this context, an improvement of the particle swarm algorithm-the function-shape-based particle swarm optimization (FSPSO) is presented. For a practical maritime cooperative search problem, FSPSO makes particles move around in the corresponding solution space according to certain rules to gather information firstly. Then FSPSO exploits the history data acquired during the first process to analyze the shape of the solution space. Based on the knowledge about the function shape, FSPSO generates solutions and iteration strategies. At last, the position and speed of each particle will be updated iteratively, aiming at producing a high quality solution to the optimization problem. The main idea behind FSPSO is to hybridize PSO with the search mode of a human being. This paper uses maritime static target cooperative search as a test domain. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of FSPSO, we perform a comparison between the performances of FSPSO with other approaches drawn from the scientific literature. Results demonstrate that FSPSO is able to produce statistically significantly higher quality solutions, outperforming many other approaches.","Decoding,Generators,history data,heuristics,information theory,particle swarm optimisation,Software packages,particle swarm optimization,maritime search,Multiplexing,iteration strategies,practical maritime cooperative search problem,Complexity theory,search problems,function shape,maritime static target cooperative search,FSPSO,function-shape,Algorithm design and analysis,cooperative,particle swarm algorithm-the,Field programmable gate arrays,"
"intensified aridity over the indo-pacific warm pool controlled by ice-sheet expansion during the last glacial maximum","2022","The magnitude, direction and cause of precipitation changes across the Indo-Pacific Warm Pool (IPWP) during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) remain elusive. In particular, it is still inconclusive whether tropical or extra-tropical factors controlled such precipitation changes. Determining the spatio-temporal distribution of precipitation in the IPWP during the LGM is a valid strategy to address this issue, but the existing precipitation records are dominantly from maritime continents and marginal seas, with few data from pelagic oceans. In order to fill this gap, we analyzed the oxygen isotopic compositions of single Ethmodiscus rex diatom frustules (δ18OE. rex) from a sediment core (WPD-03) consisting of laminated diatom mats (LDMs) in the eastern Philippine Sea (EPS). δ18OE. rex was controlled mainly by sea-surface salinity variation and, thus, can reflect open-ocean precipitation changes across the IPWP. Our precipitation proxy records, in combination with existing published data, reveal spatial patterns of precipitation change that indicate overall drying across the IPWP during the LGM. Based on a comparison of paleoclimatic records with modeling results, we propose that extra-tropical factors (ice-sheet size) controlled precipitation variability in the IPWP during the LGM through a combination of zonal shifts of ENSO and meridional migration of the ITCZ. Strong aridity during the LGM prevented formation of a subsurface barrier layer and, hence, allowed accessing of sufficient nutrients to surface waters, stimulating blooms of E. rex and subsequent formation of LDMs in the IPWP. These findings suggest an important role for high-latitude climate in the tropical hydrological cycle during the LGM.","Tropical West Pacific,Diatom blooms,Sea-surface salinity,Model simulation,Tropical hydroclimate,High-latitude forcing,"
"synoptic weather conditions and changing fire regimes in a mediterranean environment","2018","Analysis of global change effects on fire regimes requires evaluations of key processes explaining fire activity at the appropriate spatial and temporal scales. Classifications of the weather conditions prevailing at large continental scales (called “Synoptic Weather Types”, SWT) offer convenient potential proxies for integrating weather-related factors into our understanding of fire regime attributes at regional scales. Here we establish a methodology for identifying the major SWT that lead to wildfires and assessing their influence on fire regime in interaction with other global drivers such as drought events or fire suppression policies. Based on days with fires larger than 50 ha that occurred in Catalonia, a region located in the western Mediterranean Basin, we propose a clustering methodology using data of temperature at 850 hPa, sea level pressure and winds at 925 hPa from the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis dataset covering the whole of western Europe (25–70°N and 20°W–40°E). Our classification method proposes 6 SWT: three that were characterized by synoptic conditions leading to strong winds in the region, two that led to ‘hot and dry’ environments, and one that was not characterized by any strong weather determinants. Fires under ‘hot and dry’ conditions, such as the South intrusion SWT, triggered the bulk of fires and burnt area in the region. Spatial analyses of fire distribution under each SWT revealed markedly different fire-prone locations, opening the possibility for strategic planning of fire management based on local fire regimes. Fires occurring during mild years (wet spring conditions) and under ‘hot-and-dry’ SWTs have been eradicated from the region thanks to enhanced firefighting capability, and fire sizes in dry years have strongly reduced. In contrast, fires occurring under windy situations have not followed the same course of change and have not diminished in incidence over time, and seem to be more difficult to control using current fire suppression strategies. The role of SWT on determining fire regimes and its interaction with fire suppression strategies has a huge potential to help researchers and managers develop better fire analyses based on sound physical grounds and serve to understand and eventually regulate the adverse impacts of fire regime changes in a global change context.","Firefighting,Catalonia,Heat-wave,Drought event,Fire size distribution,Wind-driven fire,Kernel density,"
"maritime situational awareness forensics tools for a common information sharing environment (cise)","2019","CISE stands for Common Information Sharing Environment and refers to an architecture and set of protocols, procedures and services for the exchange of data and information across Maritime Authorities of EU (European Union) Member States (MS's). In the context of enabling the implementation and adoption of CISE by different MS's, EU has funded a number of projects that enable the development of subsystems and adaptors intended to allow MS's to connect and make use of CISE. In this context, the Integrated Systems Laboratory (ISL) has led the development of the corresponding Hellenic and Cypriot CISE by developing a Control, Command & Information (C2I) system that unifies all partial maritime surveillance systems into one National Situational Picture Management (NSPM) system, and adaptors that allow the interconnection of the corresponding national legacy systems to CISE and the exchange of data, information and requests between the two MS's. Furthermore, a set of forensics tools that allow geospatial & time filtering and detection of anomalies, risk incidents, fake MMSIs, suspicious speed changes, collision paths, and gaps in AIS (Automatic Identification System), have been developed by combining motion models, AI, deep learning and fusion algorithms using data from different databases through CISE. This paper briefly discusses these developments within the EU CISE-2020, Hellenic CISE and CY-CISE projects and the benefits from the sharing of maritime data across CISE for both maritime surveillance and security. The prospect of using CISE for the creation of a considerably rich database that could be used for forensics analysis and detection of suspicious maritime traffic and maritime surveillance is discussed.","EU Member States,surveillance,maritime traffic,CY-CISE projects,Maritime Security,Distributed CISE database,Forensics,security of data,maritime security,common information sharing environment,National Situational Picture Management system,Cypriot CISE,MS,deep learning,automatic identification system,marine engineering,Maritime Surveillance,Databases,AIS,CISE,C2I system,Europe,Information management,corresponding national legacy systems,Control,Artificial intelligence,Hellenic CISE,NSPM system,command and control systems,Command,maritime surveillance systems,control-command-information system,national security,fusion algorithms,integrated systems laboratory,ISL,Surveillance,AI,Tools,learning (artificial intelligence),time filtering,forensics tools,"
"fusion detection algorithm of maritime radar and electro-optical pod for complex sea conditions","2023","In order to improve the perceptual capability of Unmanned Surface Vessels (USVs) in complex sea conditions, a fusion detection algorithm has been developed that combines maritime radar and electro-optical (EO) pod. This algorithm integrates the positional state of the USV, class information of the maritime target obtained through a vision-based target detection algorithm, and processed maritime radar information. By using Gaussian and morphological filtering, the fusion of position state information from the USV, EO pod data, and maritime radar data is achieved. This effectively mitigates the negative impact of environmental factors, such as waves and water mist, on target detection. A cooperative sensing process between the maritime radar and EO pod is proposed to fuse the data obtained from both sources, resulting in accurate comprehensive target information. Experimental results show that the fusion algorithm achieves an average accuracy of 80.24% and a detection rate of 74.7%, enabling precise detection of maritime targets, including their distance, speed, and category. This enhanced perceptual capability is essential for USVs operating in complex maritime environments, enabling better decision-making and navigation performance.","maritime radar data,class information,accurate comprehensive target information,sensor fusion,marine radar,electro-optical pod,vision-based target detection algorithm,fusion algorithm,enhanced perceptual capability,target detection,complex maritime environments,positional state,combines maritime radar,fusion detection algorithm,object detection,complex sea conditions,Collaboration,synergistic sensing,Surface morphology,Radar,position state information,Unmanned Surface Vessels,unmanned surface vehicles,detection rate,maritime radar information,Radar imaging,USVs operating,Object detection,Signal processing algorithms,EO pod,maritime target,multi-sensor fusion,Radar detection,"
"generating bunkering statistics from ais data: a machine learning approach","2021","In shipping, the optimization of the bunkering location is dependent on price, deviation from the planned route and the cost of delays incurred by the bunkering operation itself. Despite their potential importance, detailed statistics for bunkering operations at the individual port call level (e.g. waiting times, barge capacity, location - anchorage or terminal) are not available. I develop a new method, based on the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm, that can a) identify tanker vessels used as bunkering tankers, b) detect stationary ocean-going vessels at anchorage or alongside terminals and c) automatically recognize bunkering operations as a rendezvous between an ocean-going vessel and a bunkering barge. I find that the high time complexity of the DBSCAN algorithm in this setting can be compensated by adjusting the algorithm to distributed computer settings. In the empirical study, I use the output to describe the relative importance of Mediterranean ports for bunkering and provide statistics on waiting and servicing times. The empirical findings are important for the optimization of the bunkering location decision in shipping and studies on regional port competitiveness.","Bunkering operations,Bunkering statistics,DBSCAN,Machine learning,Spatial recognition,"
"data augmentation method of object detection for deep learning in maritime image","2020","Maritime object detection is an essential element for the situational awareness in autonomous ships. Recently, as the deep learning technology evolves, the attempt that the ship recognize the surrounding environment by using deep learning technology is gradually increasing. Deep learning methods, however, require a lot of data, but lack a publicly available dataset for object detection in the maritime domain. In this paper, we proposed a data augmentation method that can automatically extend the object detection dataset in maritime image. Extract the mask of the foreground object and combine it with the new background to automatically generate the location information and data of the object. Through the proposed method, we can learn high quality data by configuring various limited data features.","object detection dataset,robot vision,Marine vehicles,ship,Machine learning,Conferences,data features,Feature extraction,maritime object detection,data augmentation method,deep learning methods,ships,object detection,feature extraction,publicly available dataset,maritime domain surveillance,situational awareness,deep learning technology,deep-learning,maritime image,mobile robots,Object detection,Data mining,data augmentation,learning (artificial intelligence),Detectors,autonomous ships,"
"a novel technique to identify ais transmissions from vessels which attempt to obscure their position by switching their ais transponder from normal transmit power mode to low transmit power mode","2022","Automatic Identification Systems (AIS) are transponder systems installed on marine vessels which transmit the location, speed and other vessel details. These signals are received by shore side AIS Base stations. The use of AIS is mandatory under international SOLAS regulations for certain categories of vessels. AIS is used to monitor for pollution, search and rescue (SAR) and illegal fishing activity. Some vessel operators deliberately interfere with their AIS transponders, including spoofing their real position or switching their AIS transponder to low transmit power, to reduce the likelihood of being detected but still being in compliance with SOLAS regulations. This might suggest that they are involved in nefarious activity. This paper presents a technique to detect vessels which are switching their Class-A, AIS transponders from normal transmit power to low transmit power mode, by utilising the Received Signal strength Indicator field (RSSI) that the receiving Base Station tags incoming AIS messages with. The technique presented, analyses received RSSI in combination with predicted RSSI values via mathematical modelling and presents a unique detection algorithm. Data from the Irish National AIS was used for the study. Although only a small amount of testing was carried out, results showed that for a test vessel which switched its transponder to low power transmit mode, it was found that a specific drop in RSSI of approximately 10 dBm (decibel-milliwatts) was detectable for different distances from the receiving base station.","AIS spoofing,Received signal strength indicator,Low transmit power,Sybil attack,Automatic identification system,"
"long-term trends in submicron particle concentrations in a metropolitan area of the northeastern united states","2018","Significant changes in emission sources have occurred in the northeastern United States over the past decade, due in part to the implementation of emissions standards, the introduction and addition of abatement technologies for road transport, changes in fuel sulfur content for road and non-road transport, as well as economic impacts of a major recession and differential fuel prices. These changes in emission scenarios likely affected the concentrations of airborne submicron particles. This study investigated the characteristics of 11–500nm particle number concentrations and their size spectra in Rochester, NY during the past 15years (2002 to 2016). The modal structure, diurnal, weekly and monthly patterns of particle number concentrations are analyzed. Long-term trends are quantified using seasonal-trend decomposition procedures based on “Loess”, Mann-Kendall regression with Theil-Sen slope and piecewise regression. Particle concentrations underwent significant (p<0.05) downward trends. An annual decrease of −323particles/cm3/y (−4.6%/y) was estimated for the total particle number concentration using Theil-Sen analysis. The trends were driven mainly by the decrease in particles in the 11–50nm range (−181particles/cm3/y; −4.7%/y). Slope changes were investigated annually and seasonally. Piecewise regression found different slopes for different portions of the overall period with the strongest declines between 2005 and 2011/2013, followed by small upward trends between 2013 and 2016 for most size bins, possibly representing increased vehicular traffic after the recovery from the 2008 recession.","Number concentration,Sources,Trends,Ultrafine particles,"
"maritime anomaly detection of malicious data spoofing and stealth deviations from nominal route exploiting heterogeneous sources of information","2021","Based on a proper stochastic formulation of the vessel dynamic, exploiting piecewise Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) mean-reverting processes, we propose an effective anomaly detection procedure to jointly reveal Automatic Identification System (AIS) data spoofing and/or surreptitious deviations from the planned route.

"timing of major forest compositional changes and tree expansions in the retezat mts during the last 16,000 years","2018","This paper focuses on the Late Glacial (LG) and Holocene regional and local establishment times of several tree and shrub species in the Retezat Mountains (South Carpathians) using pollen, stomata and plant macrofossil records from four lakes situated at different altitudes. We used the empirical and rational pollen percentage limits to infer the local presence and population expansion/recession times. Our results show that Pinus mugo and P. sylvestris spread first at 15,100 cal yr BP in the mountain. P. mugo arrived at high altitudes (1740 m) already at 13,600 cal yr BP. The expansion of Larix decidua was weakly recorded in the pollen diagrams, but the plant macrofossil and stomata records suggested its Late Glacial expansion mainly on the northern slope and local presence since 14,900 cal yr BP at 1740 m. The species likely went extinct in the Late Holocene (around 3330 cal yr BP). The expansion of Picea abies and Ulmus commenced earlier on the southern slope, from 15,200 to 14,400 cal yr BP respectively, compared to the northern slope, where these species expanded from 14,300 to 13,850 cal yr BP. The following step was the expansion of Quercus at 13,900 cal yr BP. Following the Younger Dryas decrease of temperate deciduous taxa and P. abies, their expansion on the northern flank was in the order of P. abies (11,750), Ulmus (11,600), Quercus (11,100), Corylus (10,600), Carpinus betulus (7100), Abies alba (5100) and Fagus sylvatica (5000 cal yr BP). Timing of the Early Holocene tree expansions on the southern flank is ambiguous due to uncertainties in the Early Holocene age-depth model of Lake Lia; however, the mid-Holocene expansion of C. betulus and A. alba were well-dated in both southern slope pollen records to 7700 and 6100 cal yr BP, respectively, and we inferred several hundred years earlier expansion on the southern flank that can be explained by climatic differences. Higher solar radiation results in longer growing seasons and milder winters on the southern flank, which likely facilitated the earlier spread of these trees. For several woody taxa studied in this paper, last glacial maximum refugial populations can be inferred either locally in the mountain (P. abies, P. mugo, P. sylvestris, L. decidua) or in the region (Quercus, Ulmus, C. betulus, F. sylvatica) on the basis of their pollen presence since at least 15,700–16,000 cal yr BP and early increase during the LG. We compared the pollen inferred population expansion times of several tree taxa along a south-north transect in the Romanian Carpathians, and found that the Early Holocene high altitude expansion of A. alba (10,650–9400 cal yr BP) is exceptional in the region. We also demonstrated that the Holocene mass expansion of Quercus and C. avellana started earliest in the Retezat, and at least two centuries later in other sites in the Romanian Carpathians. We also demonstrated that certain tree species had preference for survival and/or early expansion on the northern slopes (A. alba, L. decidua, F. sylvatica), while others on the southern slopes (C. avellana, C. betulus).","Postglacial forest succession,Plant macrofossils,Expansion times,Carpathian Mountains,Pollen analysis,"
"estimation of dipole magnetic moment orientation based on magnetic signature waveform analysis by a magnetic sensor","2020","In this paper, we propose a measurement procedure to estimate the magnetic moment orientation (MMO) of a dipole. Theoretical analysis indicates that magnetic field in each orthogonal direction Bi (i = x, y, z) is found to be a superposition of its three basic elements Bij (i = x, y, z and j = 1, 2, 3) along certain direction, allowing the obtained dipole signature to be decomposed of 9 basic elements. An orthogonal energy ratio (OER) algorithm is used to infer the MMO by calculating the signal energy distribution along each axis. A standard OER database is developed which provides a reference to be compared with the measured OER. The one having the smallest variance is determined as the estimated MMO. Owing to space symmetric property, it generally introduces 8 possible solutions. Then, a mathematic method is presented to define the common characteristics of the magnetic signature in the 8 octants, which is able to identify the octant of unknown target based on detected Bi field. As a result, the unique MMO can be estimated. The experimental results show good estimation accuracy for the dipole orientation with average error of 3.5°. In particular, the algorithm is independent of changing CPA and velocity, which is demonstrated in simulation and experiment.","Magnetic moment,Magnetic anomaly signature,Estimation,"
"intelligent maritime surveillance framework driven by fusion of camera-based vessel detection and ais data","2022","Efficient maritime surveillance is necessary for navigation, which usually uses cameras to capture the vessels. However, the information in camera-based data is limited.

Firstly, we employ a vessel detection network to get the relative positions of the vessels from the calibrated camera-based data. Meanwhile, we design a series of filters based on data completeness, detection range, and vessel course to exclude the invalid AIS data. In the end, we propose a data fusion module based on estimating the time when the vessel arrive at the specific position.

"dominant mechanisms for the delivery of fine sediment and phosphorus to fluvial networks draining grassland dominated headwater catchments","2015","Recent advances in monitoring technology have enabled high frequency, in-situ measurements of total phosphorus and total reactive phosphorus to be undertaken with high precision, whilst turbidity can provide an excellent surrogate for suspended sediment. Despite these measurements being fundamental to understanding the mechanisms and flow paths that deliver these constituents to river networks, there is a paucity of such data for headwater agricultural catchments. The aim of this paper is to deduce the dominant mechanisms for the delivery of fine sediment and phosphorus to an upland river network in the UK through characterisation of the temporal variability of hydrological fluxes, and associated soluble and particulate concentrations for the period spanning March 2012–February 2013. An assessment of the factors producing constituent hysteresis is undertaken following factor analysis (FA) on a suite of measured environmental variables representing the fluvial and wider catchment conditions prior to, and during catchment-wide hydrological events. Analysis indicates that suspended sediment is delivered to the fluvial system predominantly via rapidly responding pathways driven by event hydrology. However, evidence of complex, figure-of-eight hysteresis is observed following periods of hydrological quiescence, highlighting the importance of preparatory processes. Sediment delivery via a slow moving, probably sub-surface pathway does occur, albeit infrequently and during low magnitude events at the catchment outlet. Phosphorus is revealed to have a distinct hysteretic response to that of suspended sediment, with sub-surface pathways dominating. However, high magnitude events were observed to exhibit threshold-like behaviour, whereby activation and connection of usually disconnected depositional zones to the fluvial networks results in the movement of vast phosphorus fluxes. Multiple pathways are observed for particulate and soluble constituents, highlighting the challenges faced in mitigating the delivery of contaminant fluxes to headwater river systems.","Connectivity,Grassland,Suspended sediment,Fluvial,Water quality,Phosphorus,Headwater,Diffuse pollution,"

"long-range dependence in north atlantic sea level","2006","Sea level is an important parameter in climate and oceanographic applications. In this work the scaling behavior of sea level is analyzed from time series of sea level observations. The wavelet domain is particularly attractive for the identification of scaling behavior in an observed time series. The wavelet spectrum from a scale-by-scale wavelet analysis of variance reproduces in the wavelet domain the power laws underlying a scaling process, allowing the estimation of the scaling exponent from the slope of the wavelet spectrum. Here the scaling exponent is estimated in the wavelet domain for time series of sea level observations in the North Atlantic: at coastal sites from tide gauges, covering 50 years of monthly measurements, and in the open ocean from satellite altimetry, covering 12 years of satellite measurements at 10 days intervals. Both tide gauge and altimetry time series exhibit scaling behavior. Furthermore, the degree of stochastic persistence is spatially coherent and distinct at the coast and in the open ocean. Near the coast, the stochastic structure of the sea level observations is characterized by long-range dependence with a moderate degree of persistence. Larger values of the scaling exponent, consistent with weaker persistence, are concentrated in the northern Atlantic. At mid-latitudes the stochastic dependence of sea level observations is characterized by strong persistence in the form of strong long-range and 1/f dependence.","Scaling,North Atlantic,Sea level,Wavelet methods,"

The material may add to the understanding of mid- to upper-level circulation patterns and associated development of the weather systems over midlatitude, subtropical, and tropical areas in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Basic principles regarding the interpretation of WV imagery and dynamical fields for synoptic-scale applications have been extracted from the considerations and summarized.","Potential vorticity anomalies,Jet streams,Atmospheric fronts,Tropical cyclone intensification,Cyclogenesis,Extratropical transition,Baroclinic zone,Blocking circulation,"
"chapter 10 - on the use of evolutionary algorithms for localization and mapping: infrastructure monitoring in smart cities via miniaturized autonomous sensory agents","2019","Miniaturized autonomous sensory agents (MASAs) can play a pivotal role in smart cities of tomorrow. From monitoring underground infrastructure such as pollution in water pipes, to exploration of natural resources such as oil and gas. These smart agents will not only detect anomalies, they are expected to provide sufficient data to facilitate mapping the detected anomalies, while—cleverly—adopting their behavior based on the changes presented in the environment. However, given these objectives and due to MASA’s miniaturization, conventional designing methods are not suitable to design MASA. On one hand, it is not possible to use the widely adopted simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) schemes, because of the hardware limitations on-board of MASA. Furthermore, the targeted environments for MASA in a smart city are typically GPS-denied, hardly accessible, and either completely or partially unknown. Furthermore, designing MASA’s hardware and their autonomous on-line behavior presents an additional challenge. In this chapter, we present a framework dubbed as evolutionary localization and mapping (EVOLAM), which uses multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) to tackle the design and algorithmic challenges in using MASAs in monitoring infrastructure. This framework facilitates offline localization and mapping, while adaptively tuning offline hardware constraints and online behavior. In addition, we present different types of MOEAs that can be used within the framework. Finally, we project EVOLAM on a case-study, thus highlighting MOEA effectiveness in solving different complex localization and mapping problems.","Miniaturized autonomous sensory agents,Localization,Evolutionary computation,Mapping,Infrastructure monitoring,"
"unsupervised maritime traffic pattern extraction from spatio-temporal data","2015","Maritime traffic pattern extraction is a fundamental and crucial factor for maritime surveillance and anomaly detection. Emerging technologies like Automatic Identification System (AIS) provides multi-dimensional data which is used to construct a maritime traffic model. In this paper, we propose a framework of maritime traffic pattern extraction from vessel AIS information, which learns a traffic pattern using an unsupervised technique, and can be applied on historical Automatic Identification System data. AIS data is a kind of spatio-temporal data that contains information of location data, as well as time stamps. In this way, traffic pattern is described by AIS data. Furthermore, we conduct a simulation experiment that extracts traffic pattern from the AIS data through the unsupervised technique.

"machine learning-assisted anomaly detection in maritime navigation using ais data","2020","The automatic identification system (AIS) reports vessels' static and dynamic information, which are essential for maritime traffic situation awareness. However, AIS transponders can be switched off to hide suspicious activities, such as illegal fishing, or piracy. Therefore, this paper uses real world AIS data to analyze the possibility of successful detection of various anomalies in the maritime domain. We propose a multi-class artificial neural network (ANN)-based anomaly detection framework to classify intentional and non-intentional AIS on-off switching anomalies. The multi-class anomaly framework captures AIS message dropouts due to various reasons, e.g., channel effects or intentional one for carrying illegal activities. We extract position, speed, course and timing information from real world AIS data, and use them to train a 2-class (normal and anomaly) and a 3-class (normal, power outage and anomaly) anomaly detection models. Our results show that the models achieve around 99.9% overall accuracy, and are able to classify a test sample in the order of microseconds.","security of data,maritime traffic situation awareness,multiclass anomaly framework,pattern classification,multiclass artificial neural network,AIS message dropouts,neural nets,illegal fishing,learning (artificial intelligence),illegal activities,ships,automatic identification system,marine engineering,machine learning-assisted anomaly detection,maritime navigation,AIS transponders,"

"maritime anomaly detection and threat assessment","2010","Ships involved in commercial activities tend to follow set patterns of behaviour depending on the business in which they are engaged. If a ship exhibits anomalous behaviour, this could indicate it is being used for illicit activities. With the wide availability of automatic identification system (AIS) data it is now possible to detect some of these patterns of behaviour. Monitoring the possible threat posed by the worldwide movement of ships, however, requires efficient and robust automatic data processing to create a priority list for further investigation. This paper outlines five anomalous ship behaviours: deviation from standard routes, unexpected AIS activity, unexpected port arrival, close approach, and zone entry. For each behaviour, a process is described for determining the probability that it is anomalous. Individual probabilities are combined using a Bayesian network to calculate the overall probability that a specific threat is present.

Based on the dominance of cloud effect on solar irradiance and the advantage of the high spatial resolution of a geostationary satellite, a novel method is presented for optimizing the location of measuring sites for the newly built Hellenic Network of Solar Energy (www.helionet.gr). The k-means algorithm is used for cluster analysis and the validation of the clustering method reveals that the variability of surface solar irradiance due to cloudiness over Greece could be sufficiently monitored with the establishment of 22 ground-based instruments. The spatial representativeness of the proposed sites is also assessed.

"the nitrate radical: physics, chemistry, and the atmosphere","1991","This review surveys the present state of knowledge of the nitrate (NO3 radical. Laboratory data on the physics and chemistry of the radical and atmospheric determination of the concentrations of the radical are both considered. One aim of the review is to highlight the relationship between the laboratory and the atmospheric studies. Although the emphasis of the review is on gas-phase processes, relevant studies conducted in condensed phases are mentioned because of their potential importance in the interpretation of cloud and aerosol chemistry. The spectroscopy, structure, and photochemistry of the radical are examined. Here, the object is to establich the spectroscopic basis for detection of the radical and measurement of its concentration in the laboratory and in the atmosphere. Infrared, visible, and paramagnetic resonance spectra are considered. An important quantity discussed is the absorption cross section in the visible region, which is required for quantitative measurements. Interpretation of the spectroscopic features requires an understanding of the geometrical and electronic structure of the radical in its ground and excited states; there is still some controversy about the groundstate geometry, but the most recent experimental evidence 9eg from laser induced fluorescence) and theoretical calculations suggest that the radical has D3h symmetry. Photodissociation of the radical is important in the atmosphere, and the product channels, quantum yields, and dissociation dynamics are discussed. A short examination of the thermodynamics (heat and entropy of formation) of the radical is presented. The main exposition of laboratory studies of the chemistry of the nitrate radical is preceded by a consideration of the techniques used for kinetic and mechanistic studies. Methods for the generation and detection of the radical and the kinetic tools employed are all presented. The exact nature of the technique used in individual studies has some relevance to the way in which data must be analysed, and to the type of mechanistic information that can be extracted. Continuous and stopped flow, flash photolysis and pulse radiolysis, molecular modulation, and static reactor techniques can all provide absolute kinetic data, while relative rate measurements have been a further rich source of information. The treatment of the chemical reactions of the nitrate radical is formally divided into the interactions with non-radical inorganic (deemed to include NO and NO2) and organic species, and with atoms and free radicals. In general, the reactions with open-shell species are much more rapid than those with closed-shell reactants. With the closed-shell partners, addition reactions are faster than abstraction reactions. An attempt is made to consider critically the published data on most reactions of importance, and to tabulate rate constants and temperature dependences where possible. However, it is not the objective of this review to provide recommendations for rate parameters. Evidence for the products of the reactions is sought, and for the branching ratios into the various channels where more than one exists. One theme of this part of the review is the elucidation of correlations of reactivity with structure and with the reactions of other radical species such as OH. The review turns next to a consideration of the role of NO3 in the atmosphere, of its atmospheric sources and sinks, and of field measurements of concentrations of the radical. Long-path visible-absorption spectroscopy and matrix-isolation ESR have both been used successfully in field measurements in the troposphere as well as the stratosphere. Balloon-borne instruments and ground-based remote sensing have been used to obtain stratospheric concentrations. Two of the most important implications of the measurements are that the stratospheric profiles are consistent with accepted chemistry (and, in particular, do not require the postulation of an unidentified scavenging mechanism that had, at one stage, been proposed), and that the highly variable night-time tropospheric concentrations imply that NO3 is a reactive tropospheric constituent. The inter-relation between laboratory studies and atmospheric observations, and the problems in extrapolating laboratory data to atmospheric conditions, are both explored. Initiation of night-time chemical transformations by NO3 and the possible production of OH are considered. The available information is then brought together to see how far NO3 is a sensitive indicator of the state of the atmosphere, and some speculations are presented about the involvement of NO3 (or N2O5) in damage to trees and plants. The final section of the review suggests some issues that remain unresolved concerning the NO3 radical which is directly or indirectly relevant to a better knowledge of the part played by the radical in the atmosphere. Amongst the requirements noted are improved data for the heat of formation of the radical, its absorption cross section in the visible region (and, especially, the temperature dependence of the cross section), and the details of its photochemistry. There is also still a need for a definitive determination of the equilibrium constant and its temperature dependence for the association with NO2 and the reverse dissociation of N2O5. A series of chemical reactions deserves further investigation, especially with regard to elucidation of product channels, and overall oxidation mechanisms also need to be defined better. Future atmospheric studies that are desirable include study of basic NO3 chemistry in the field to understand the influence of humidity on the conversion (probably on surfaces) of N2O5 to HNO3, and thus on NO3 concentrations. In addition, a study of the chemistry of NO3 in the presence of volatile organic compounds and at elevated concentrations of the oxides of nitrogen should help in the understanding of, for example, polluted marine coasts, forests, and urban areas.",""

"improving volcanic ash cloud detection by a robust satellite technique","2004","Automated and reliable satellite-based techniques are strongly required for volcanic ash cloud detection and tracking. In fact, volcanic ash clouds pose a serious hazard for air traffic and the synoptic (and possibly frequent) coverage offered by satellites can provide exciting opportunities for monitoring activities as well as for risk mitigation purposes. A new, AVHRR-based technique for improved automatic detection of volcanic clouds by means of multi-temporal analysis of historical, long-term satellite records has been recently proposed. The technique basically rests on the Robust AVHRR Techniques (RAT) approach, which is an innovative strategy of satellite data analysis, devoted to a former characterisation of the measured signal, in terms of expected value and natural variability and a further recognition of signal anomalies by an automatic, unsupervised change detection step. In this work, an extension of this method to nighttime observations is presented, by using thermal infrared information coming from AVHRR bands centred approximately at 3.5, 11.0 and 12.0 μm. Results achieved for two recent eruptive events of Mount Etna (occurred in May 2000 and in July 2001) seem to be encouraging, showing clear improvements in terms of ash detection sensitivity as well as in terms of false alarms reduction. The technique performance is also evaluated by comparison with the traditional “split-window” brightness temperature difference method; this exercise revealed a general improvement obtained by the proposed approach, even though some common problems still remain unsolved. The main merits of such an approach are its intrinsic self-adaptability to different environmental/natural/observational conditions and its natural exportability also to different satellite sensors. The results here presented show the benefits of such a technique especially when different observational conditions (time of pass, seasonal period, atmospheric moisture, solar illumination, volcanic cloud composition, satellite angles of view, etc.) are considered. The future prospects, also in terms of possible operational scenarios, coming from the implementation of such an approach on the new generation of satellite sensors (like, for example, SEVIRI aboard Meteosat Second Generation platform) are also discussed.","Volcanic monitoring from space,Mount Etna,Ash clouds detection/discrimination,Multi-temporal analyses,Robust AVHRR Techniques (RAT),AVHRR,"

In addition, it could be required to correlate results with intelligence data and to integrate radar systems with the automatic identification system (AIS) and vessel traffic services (VTS). Other issues could be providing navigational risk detection to support operators, as well as improving resource allocation for greater efficiency and cost savings.

"automatic detection of rescue targets in maritime search and rescue missions using uavs","2022","Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can be an important resource when performing Search and Rescue (SAR) operations at sea, as this technology is fairly inexpensive when compared to traditional SAR approaches that use significant human resources and expensive air and naval assets, thus enabling the deployment of several UAVs simultaneously in these missions to perform rescue targets search in maritime environments.In order to maximize the usefulness of these UAVs in such operations, we propose a method which utilizes a state-of-the-art object detection network to perform real-time rescue target detection on-board the UAV, using standard RGB cameras, with minimal human intervention, thus enabling an increased vehicle autonomy and search range. Additionally, since the UAVs only relay the candidate images and locations that contain possible rescue targets, given by the onboard detector, it is possible to have several UAVs working in parallel that report back to a single human operator.We have selected the YOLOv4-tiny detection network, pretrained in the COCO dataset, and retrained it to detect rescue targets at sea. For this purpose some datasets were recorded and annotated to simulate the presence of maritime rescue targets.

"extraction of maritime road networks from large-scale ais data","2019","Extracting road network information including lane boundaries, lane centerlines, junctions and their relationship from AIS data plays an important role in location based services, urban computing and intelligent transportation systems, etc. However, AIS data are large scale, high noisy, the density and quality are very uneven in different areas, extracting a whole, continuous and smooth maritime road network with rich information from such data is a challenging problem. To address these issues, this paper proposes an adaptive maritime road network extraction approach that can extract both lane boundaries and centerlines for a large sea area from AIS data. Based on a road network definition including nodes, segments and segment curves, the approach designs parallel grid merging and filtering algorithms to determine if a grided area is inside lane or not.

"unsupervised anomaly detection for underwater gliders using generative adversarial networks","2021","An effective anomaly detection system is critical for marine autonomous systems operating in complex and dynamic marine environments to reduce operational costs and achieve concurrent large-scale fleet deployments. However, developing an automated fault detection system remains challenging for several reasons including limited data transmission via satellite services. Currently, most anomaly detection for marine autonomous systems, such as underwater gliders, rely on intensive analysis by pilots. This study proposes an unsupervised anomaly detection system using bidirectional generative adversarial networks guided by assistive hints for marine autonomous systems with time series data collected by multiple sensors. In this study, the anomaly detection system for a fleet of underwater gliders is trained on two healthy deployment datasets and tested on other nine deployment datasets collected by a selection of vehicles operating in a range of locations and environmental conditions. The system is successfully applied to detect anomalies in the nine test deployments, which include several different types of anomalies as well as healthy behaviour.

In particular, functional integration of COSMO/SkyMed with other future EO constellations offers a great improvement on revisit time of Mediterranean area, which is reduced from 15 to less than 6 hours. The novel method developed to design AIS constellations leads to a candidate system relying on 8 satellites on 4 orbital planes which guarantee a ship location update of less than 1 hour and a mean time between EO images and AIS data retrieval of slightly less than 30 minutes.","Satellites,COSMO-SkyMed,ship traffic management,remote sensing,pollution measurement,EO constellations,Marine vehicles,Monitoring,illegal maritime operation identification,ships,maritime surveillance,Europe,Orbits,marine pollution,traffic control,artificial satellites,Imaging,automatic identification systems,marine control,Spaceborne radar,Mediterranean area,earth observing constellations,future space AIS systems,oceanographic techniques,"
"analysis of maritime air defence scenarios","2014","In this paper, we examine scenarios of maritime air defence where the threats can be of different types i.e., characterized by varying different single shot probabilities of hit. We develop a methodology that integrates constrained optimization calculus, dynamic programming and a genetic algorithm to determine the optimal allocation of interceptors that globally maximize the probability of raid annihilation. We call this strategy the Heterogeneous tactic. We show that the improvement in the probability of raid annihilation could exceed thirty percent for one scenario examined, relative to a Shoot-Look-Shoot tactic with fixed size salvos.","Dynamic programming,global maximization,military systems,heterogeneous tactic,maritime air defence scenario,raid annihilation probability,probability,Weapons,Biological cells,Statistics,dynamic programming,genetic algorithms,constrained optimization calculus,Sociology,genetic algorithm,calculus,Genetic algorithms,Resource management,"
"detecting anomalies from a multitarget tracking output","2014","Surveillance systems typically incorporate multitarget tracking algorithms for sequential estimation of kinematic states (e.g. positions, velocities) of moving objects in the surveillance domain of interest. This letter proposes an algorithm for online detection of anomalies in the motion and the count of objects, using the output of a multiobject tracking algorithm. The surveillance area is partitioned by a square grid and the kinematic states that fall inside each cell of the grid are modelled by a Poisson point process. During the unsupervised learning phase, the parameters of the Poisson point process are estimated for each cell. The testing phase is performed sequentially by threshold detection at a specified level of significance. The performance of the algorithm is illustrated using the Automatic Identification System (AIS) dataset in the context of maritime surveillance.","Kinematics,Kernel,multiobject tracking algorithm,Vectors,Poisson point process,sequential estimation,target tracking,unsupervised learning phase,multitarget tracking algorithms,Testing,object tracking,automatic identification system dataset,maritime surveillance,Partitioning algorithms,Tracking,online anomaly detection,Surveillance,kinematic states,video surveillance,"
"impact of the open biomass fires in spring and summer of 2006 on the chemical composition of background air in south-eastern finland","2008","In the spring and summer of 2006 the air quality in southern Finland was affected by two major biomass fire smoke episodes. At the Virolahti background station, closest to the eastern fire areas, the episodes lasted altogether several weeks. The high point in spring was 25 April and in summer 13 August. In spring the aerosol detected at Virolahti originated at distances of even hundreds of kilometres to the south and south-east, and consequently was a mixture of material from biomass burning and from other sources (both LRT and local), all of which contributed to the detected elevation of PM10 concentrations. The elevated concentrations of trace elements (Cd, Pb, Zn) during the most intense biomass fire episode were associated with other anthropogenic emissions. In contrast, during August 2006, the PM10 at Virolahti was quite exclusively impacted by close (ca. 50–100km) biomass fire sources. The presumably organic component comprised, at its highest, as much as 90% of the total PM10. In addition to record high PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations, the concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were considerably elevated, even reaching values more typical of wintertime urban environments. During the peaks of the episodes in August, the total gaseous mercury concentration in the air was more than double its background value. In general, the trace elements did not exceed their background values.","PM,Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons,Total gaseous mercury,Open biomass fires,Trace elements,"

"maritime surveillance using spaceborne gnss-reflectometry: the role of the scattering configuration and receiving polarization channel","2018","Recent studies have analyzed the chance of exploiting Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS)-Reflectometry observables for maritime surveillance and sea target detection. In this paper, we provide a feasibility study of the ship detection problem using spaceborne GNSS-R data. The analysis is performed via the evaluation of the signal-to-noise-plus-clutter-ratio and signal-to-noise-ratio relevant to an isolated ship target in open sea. In particular, we investigated the impact of the GNSS-R acquisition geometry and radar signal polarization. The influence of sea state and ship orientation is assessed as well. The analysis is based on a sound theoretical electromagnetic model of the bistatic radar cross section of the ship target. The analysis clearly shows the benefits of 1) the backscattering configuration with respect to the conventional forward-scattering one and 2) the RHCP receiving channel w.r.t. the conventional LHCP one, used in sea surface analysis. However, the ship orientation and the sea state still play a key role in ship detectability.","marine radar,ship orientation,ship detection problem,ship detection,radar detection,radar clutter,spaceborne GNSS-Reflectometry,Marine vehicles,reflectometry,marine navigation,bistatic radar cross section,electromagnetic model,radar signal polarization,signal-to-noise-plus-clutter-ratio,ships,ship detectability,satellite navigation,bistatic radar,maritime surveillance,radar cross-sections,object detection,Sea surface,forward-scattering,Backscatter,backscattering geometry,backscattering configuration,sea target detection,Global Navigation Satellite Systems-Reflectometry,isolated ship target,sea surface analysis,Ocean temperature,spaceborne radar,Signal to noise ratio,RHCP receiving channel w.r.t,Spaceborne radar,spaceborne GNSS-R data,electromagnetic wave scattering,backscatter,GNSS-Reflectometry,Global navigation satellite system,electromagnetic wave polarisation,"
"monitoring of high biomass phaeocystis globosa blooms in the southern north sea by in situ and future spaceborne hyperspectral radiometry","2022","Phaeocystis globosa (P. globosa hereafter) is a phytoplankton species which commonly blooms at high biomass in April–May in the Southern North Sea and forms undesirable foam which accumulates on the beaches. Monitoring of this species is required by EU directives. Measurement of phytoplankton species composition has historically been made by pigment or microscopic analysis of water samples, which is spatially sparse and temporally infrequent e.g. weekly/monthly. In-water instruments such as flow cytometers can provide very high frequency data but at high acquisition and maintenance cost. Automated in situ above water radiometry has the potential to provide very high frequency data at single locations but requires very careful design of processing algorithms in turbid waters with high non-algal absorption. Spaceborne radiometry could provide both very good spatial coverage and moderate/high frequency of data, e.g. daily/weekly, but accurate determination of phytoplankton species composition is considerably more difficult in turbid waters than in open ocean waters. Prior studies based on a limited number of shipborne reflectance measurements suggested feasibility of P. globosa detection in turbid waters from hyperspectral radiometry. The availability of a new autonomous above water hyperspectral radiometer system has enabled further refinement and intensive testing of these techniques. From a time-series of 4356 water reflectance spectra measured near Ostend harbour in Belgian coastal waters from 2020/04/01 to 2020/08/18, two existing algorithms for P. globosa detection were successfully applied. Results show a high biomass P. globosa bloom occurring in late-April/early-May as found every year in water sample analyses for Belgian coastal waters. The high temporal resolution of the radiometric data allows to capture the evolution of the bloom at time scales sufficiently short (hourly and daily) compared to growth/decay and tidal processes. The challenges of extending the methods to future spaceborne instruments are also tested by simulating the impact of errors in sensor inter-band calibration, atmospheric correction and radiometric noise. Results show that because of their spectral coherence, atmospheric correction errors impact only slightly P. globosa detection whereas inaccuracy in inter-band calibration and radiometric noise are much more problematic as they affect each spectral band independently. Because radiometric noise should be reduced in the new generation of hyperspectral sensors and can always be reduced by spatial binning, the inter-band relative calibration uncertainty appears to be the main challenge for spaceborne mission design. Indeed, it was demonstrated that inter-band calibration error should be <0.25% and ideally 0.1% at top of the atmosphere highlighting the need for particular attention to inter-band calibration in sensor design and post processing treatments including vicarious calibration.","Belgian coastal zone,Inter-band calibration,PANTHYR,Signal to noise ratio,Autonomous measurements,Hyperspectral radiometry,Hyperspectral satellite sensors,"
"automatic identification of maritime incidents from unstructured articles","2018","In this paper, we present two Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for identifying maritime incidents described in unstructured articles from multiple sources. The first technique is a document classification scheme that determines if an article describes a maritime incident. Two variations of each article are created: the first only contains the article's title, the other contains the title and content. These are converted to both binary and frequency bags-of-words. Furthermore, two feature selection methods are tested: Weka's CfsSubsetEval and retaining the 300 most frequent words. Each dataset is tested with 41 classifiers from the Weka suite, with the most accurate classifiers including Logistic Regression (98.5%), AdaBoostM1(BayesNet) (98.33%), and RandomForest (97.56%). The second technique performs information extraction on an article to determine the location of the maritime incident. In addition to using regular expressions and Named Entity Recognition (NER), the approach focuses its attention on sentences that contain piracy keywords as well as sentences which occur earlier in the article. In our testing, this approach achieved 87.9% accuracy. Together the two techniques form a pipeline where the positive examples from the document classification algorithm are fed into the information extraction algorithm.","Risk management,unstructured articles,information extraction algorithm,Natural Language Processing,Information retrieval,word processing,Conferences,Feature extraction,natural language processing,maritime risk assessment,regression analysis,automatic maritime incident identification,RandomForest,Weka suite classifiers,marine engineering,Logistic Regression,piracy keywords,feature extraction,pattern classification,risk management,random processes,Named Entity Recognition,feature selection,document classification,text analysis,Natural language processing,Task analysis,Weka CfsSubsetEval,Data mining,learning (artificial intelligence),binary bags-of-words,AdaBoostM1,frequency bags-of-words,"
"cultural dynamics and ceramic resource use at late bronze age/early iron age troy, northwestern turkey","2013","Changes in resource use over time can provide insight into technological choice and the extent of long-term stability in cultural practices. In this paper we re-evaluate the evidence for a marked demographic shift at the inception of the Early Iron Age at Troy by applying a robust macroscale analysis of changing ceramic resource use over the Late Bronze and Iron Age. We use a combination of new and legacy analytical datasets (NAA and XRF), from excavated ceramics, to evaluate the potential compositional range of local resources (based on comparisons with sediments from within a 10 km site radius). Results show a clear distinction between sediment-defined local and non-local ceramic compositional groups. Two discrete local ceramic resources have been previously identified and we confirm a third local resource for a major class of EIA handmade wares and cooking pots. This third source appears to derive from a residual resource on the Troy peninsula (rather than adjacent alluvial valleys). The presence of a group of large and heavy pithoi among the non-local groups raises questions about their regional or maritime origin.","Local production,Bottom-up sampling,Macro-analysis,Multivariate analysis,Neutron Activation Analysis,Statistical power relationships,Legacy datasets,"
"analysis of potential regions for maritime using qgis tool","2022","The paper explains the advancement of seafood production using remote sensing methods virtually.

So, people are checking for the alternatives and marine aqua culture is the fast-growing food resources.

"long-term trends of upwelling and impacts on primary productivity in the alaskan beaufort sea","2013","Using a previously established wind proxy for upwelling along the North Slope of Alaska, we examine the interannual to decadal variability in upwelling as well as the climatological monthly trends. The ability of the upwelling to trigger phytoplankton blooms via upward nitrate flux from the halocline is then investigated using data from a moored array together with the proxy. The 70-year record of wind speed from the Barrow, Alaska meteorological station (1941–2010) reveals that strong upwelling events – lasting at least 4 days and exceeding 10m/s during the storm – occur throughout the year. On average there are 9–10 upwelling events per year, and the number and strength of events has increased over the last 25 years. The low-frequency variability in the upwelling co-varies with previously documented Arctic climate trends, but there is no significant correlation with various high latitude atmospheric indices. There are two seasonal peaks in the occurrence of upwelling, in May and November. The role of the Beaufort High and Aleutian Low in driving the upwelling is investigated using NCEP reanalysis fields. Fluctuations in both of these centers of action contribute to the enhanced winds, and the location of the Aleutian Low storm track plays a key role in the seasonal variability of the upwelling. The upward nitrate flux due to storms in the open water period can account for new primary production that is on par with carbon fixed during the summer growing season in the absence of storms. Evidence from satellite ocean color data of such wind-induced phytoplankton blooms is presented.","Primary production,Long-term wind trends,Upwelling trends,Nitrate flux,"

"maritime traffic route detection framework based on statistical density analysis from ais data using a clustering algorithm","2022","Maritime traffic routes by ships navigation vary according to country and geographic characteristics, and they differ according to the characteristics of the ships. In ocean areas adjacent to coasts, regulated routes are present, e.g., traffic separation scheme for ships entering and leaving; however, most ocean areas do not have such routes. Maritime traffic route research has been conducted based on computer engineering to create routes; however, ship characteristics were not considered. Thus, this article proposes a framework to generate maritime traffic routes using statistical density analysis. Here, automatic identification system (AIS) data are used to derive quantitative traffic routes. Preprocessing is applied to the AIS data, and a similar ship trajectory pattern is decomposed into a matrix based on the Hausdorffâ€“distance algorithm and then stored in a database. A similar pattern makes the AIS trajectory simple using the Douglasâ€“Peucker algorithm. In addition, density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) is performed to identify the waypoints of vessels then create routes by connecting waypoints. The width of maritime routes created based on a similar ship trajectory is subjected to kernel density estimation analysis (KDE). Then, waypoints evaluation of the main route is performed from the results of KDE 75% and 90% considering the statistical in the total maritime traffic, and the results applied to the targeted ocean area are compared. Finally, the result of KDE 90% of maritime traffic with framework analyzed the safety route, which can be a basis for developing routes for maritime autonomous surface ships.","traffic separation scheme,ocean areas,marine accidents,Clustering algorithms,Safety,targeted ocean area,Douglas-Peucker algorithm,automatic identification system data,vehicle routing,total maritime traffic,Marine vehicles,maritime autonomous surface ships,quantitative traffic routes,geographic characteristics,DBSCAN,statistical analysis,ships,marine safety,kernel density estimation,AIS trajectory simple,maritime traffic route detection framework,kernel density estimation analysis,Oceans,Hausdorff-distance algorithm,ship trajectory pattern,framework,pattern clustering,Artificial intelligence,statistical density analysis,marine engineering computing,Trajectory,ship characteristics,maritime traffic route research,Navigation,safety route,density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise,clustering algorithm,AIS data,maritime traffic route,"
"rainwater chemical composition at two sites in central mexico","2006","Chemical analyses were performed on rainwater samples collected at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) in Mexico City and at a wooded site, Rancho Viejo (RV) in the State of Mexico, for the periods 1994–2000 and 1994–1999, respectively. At UNAM, rainwater was collected for the entire rainy season period each year, while at RV, technical considerations limited collection to weekends only. The results showed large variations in rainwater chemical composition in most years, mainly because of the variability of meteorological conditions and also because of changes in source emissions. Sulfates and NH4+ showed higher annual volume-weighted mean concentrations (VWMC) in both sites. At UNAM, the maximum annual VWMC for SO42− occurred in March and the minimum in July and August. Lower concentrations of almost all ions were found at RV; however, the H+ concentration was higher at this site. The pH in Mexico City, calculated from the annual VWMC of H+, was 4.95, which is a little higher than pH values reported in some other countries. Despite the fact that sulfate and NO3− concentrations were lower at RV, the pH was lower. Air-mass back trajectories were calculated for individual concentrations of SO42−, H+, NH4+, Ca2+, and Mg2+, observed at each sampling site for weekend data. At RV, sulfate concentrations were higher when air-mass back trajectories indicated a wind flow from Mexico City and Toluca at 1000 MAGL (meters above ground level) and 3000 MAGL. The hydrogen ion exhibited the same behavior. Calcium and Mg2+ concentrations were also higher when the wind blew from urban areas at 1000 and 3000 MAGL. At UNAM, H+ concentration was lower and Ca2+ and Mg2+ were higher when wind blew from the northern sector of the city at 1000 and 3000 MAGL. In UNAM, the NO3−/SO42− and NH4+/SO42− ratios were 0.5 and 1.09 in 1994 and 0.86 and 1.64 in 2000, respectively, indicating a decrease in SO2 emissions resulting from the change of fuel oil to gas fuel. The SO42−/Ca2+ ratio was significantly lower at the UNAM site (1.82) compared to RV (5.36), and the SO42−/H+ ratio was significantly higher at the UNAM site (6.77) compared to RV (2.01). The Spearman's rho correlation between ionic concentrations indicated a positive correlation in most cases (p<0.05) for data from UNAM and RV. The multiple regression correlation analysis to predict H+ concentration in Mexico City showed that NO3−, NH4+, SO42−, and Ca2+ contributed 23.2%, 20.9%, 8.0%, and 6.1%, respectively, to the H+ prediction, while Cl− plus Na+ plus K+ only contributed 2.2%, and Mg2+ did not contribute. Sea-salt contribution to rainwater chemical composition was negligible with any wind direction at both levels. Excess sulfate (non-sea-salt sulfate) represented 98.7% of the total sulfate in rainwater collected during weekends at RV and 98.6% for weekend and annual rain samples at UNAM.","Central Mexico,Acidity in forests,Annual variations,Rainwater chemistry,"
"detection and geovisualization of abnormal vessel behavior from video","2021","Intelligent maritime situational awareness pursues an effective understanding of the majority of the activities related to the maritime domain (impacting the safety, security, economy, or environment), with the aid of artificial intelligence systems. Such an understanding requires the development of automated processes capable of not only detecting abnormal behavior but also of visually-representing and interpreting it. Although much progress has been made in anomaly detection and visualization using vessel self-reporting positioning data, there have been no corresponding advances using video data, despite the increasing use of cameras for maritime surveillance. In this work, we introduce a framework which goes beyond vessel tracking for anomaly detection in video, and is therefore applicable to scenes with a high density of vessels. The proposed framework detects abnormal behavior using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and interprets this knowledge using metrics derived from clustering the positions and courses provided by an independent vessel/motion detector. These detections are geovisualized using an advanced displaying tool where detected abnormal behavior may be localized on the globe, providing an infrastructure for intelligent maritime situational awareness.","generative adversarial network,surveillance,Safety,anomaly detection,Generative adversarial networks,data visualisation,Knowledge engineering,security of data,geovisualization,intelligent maritime situational awareness,marine engineering,abnormal vessel behavior,maritime surveillance,vessel self-reporting positioning data,object detection,maritime domain,Measurement,Real-time systems,video signal processing,artificial intelligence systems,Tools,artificial intelligence,Detectors,"

"developing a framework for attribution analysis of urban pluvial flooding to human-induced climate impacts","2021","This study proposes a framework for the attribution analysis of urban flooding to historical anthropogenic climate impacts using real (historical) and counterfactual (natural) simulations from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) and Phase 6 (CMIP6) general circulation models (GCMs). A cluster analysis is implemented to select independent GCMs and to decrease the high computational time of the urban flood modeling. A two-step spatiotemporal statistical downscaling based on the generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution parameters is performed to meet the requirement of a fine-scale precipitation resolution for the urban flood simulations. Using the downscaled distribution parameters, the intensity–duration-frequency (IDF) curves and composite design storms for four return periods of 2, 10, 20 and 50 years are created to be used as the inputs of an InfoWorks ICM hydrodynamic model for a case study in Antwerp city, Belgium. The fraction of attributable risk (FAR) framework and the causal counterfactual probability theory are used to quantify anthropogenic climate influences on urban pluvial flooding. The results show that the GEV parameters of location and scale nicely follow the power relation, providing an opportunity for the temporal downscaling of precipitation extremes. A disagreement is found between the GCMs on the contribution of anthropogenic climate factors on pluvial flooding, some illustrating a higher probability of flooding due to anthropogenic climate impacts, and some a lower one. It can therefore be concluded that the urban flooding in Antwerp is not attributable to anthropogenic climate impacts.","Scaling relations,Fraction of attributable risk,CMIP6 GCMs,Urban flood,Generalized extreme value (GEV) parameters,Extreme precipitation,"

The purpose of this study is to determine a strategic location as a center for maritime defense logistics distribution lines in order to secure the IKN area using the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) method combined with satellite image analysis using a Geographic Information System (GIS) by considering the criteria and sub-criteria in determining the location center for maritime defense logistics distribution lines. The results of the research from the AHP weighting method show that the priority order of criteria based on experts is safety from natural conditions, population conditions, environmental locations, distribution line conditions, and required cost. The results of remote sensing satellite image data processing with analysis using Geographic Information Systems with ArcGIS software shows that the results of satellite image overlays are equipped with regional boundaries and routes around IKN. The determination of the location of the center of the distribution line for the defense logistics of the marine sector is concentrated in Samboja District, surely in the Kampung Lama Village which is also used as the location point for the pier plan. Kampung Lama Village, Samboja has criteria and sub-criteria that meet to be used as a central location for maritime defense logistics distribution lines to secure the IKN area. Obviously, Kampung Lama Village is also used as the location point for the pier plan.","Satellites,IKN Nusantara,Remote sensing,remote sensing,Safety,Sociology,maritime defense Logistics route,defence industry,Logistics support center,Geographic Information System,logistics,IKN area,satellite image overlays,Statistics,maritime defense logistics distribution lines,location center,geographic information systems,Geographic Information System (GIS),satellite image analysis,distribution line conditions,Software,logistics distribution center,indonesian capital city,Analytical Hierarchy Process method,remote sensing satellite image data processing,sensing satellite technology,location point,military defense base,Security,Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP),"
"towards an ml-based semantic iot for pandemic management: a survey of enabling technologies for covid-19","2023","The connection between humans and digital technologies has been documented extensively in the past decades but needs to be evaluated through the current global pandemic. Artificial Intelligence(AI), with its two strands, Machine Learning (ML) and Semantic Reasoning, has proven to be a great solution to provide efficient ways to prevent, diagnose and limit the spread of COVID-19. IoT solutions have been widely proposed for COVID-19 disease monitoring, infection geolocation, and social applications. In this paper, we investigate the usage of the three technologies for handling the COVID-19 pandemic. For this purpose, we surveyed the existing ML applications and algorithms proposed during the pandemic to detect COVID-19 disease using symptom factors and image processing. The survey includes existing approaches including semantic technologies and IoT systems for COVID-19. Based on the survey result, we classified the main challenges and the solutions that could solve them. The study proposes a conceptual framework for pandemic management and discusses challenges and trends for future research.","Ontologies,Internet of things,COVID-19,Survey,Machine learning,Cloud architecture,"
"improving group transit schemes to minimize negative effects of maritime piracy","2014","Contemporary maritime piracy around the Horn of Africa presents a serious threat to the global shipping industry. A number of countermeasures were deployed to minimize the probability of a successful ship hijack, one of them being the establishment of the International Recommended Transit Corridor (IRTC). Currently, all ships transiting the Gulf of Aden are recommended to follow the IRTC and take part in group transit schemes (GTSs)-prescribed fixed schedules stating a time of arrival to the beginning of the corridor and a speed at which to sail through the corridor. We provide a number of contributions that improve the GTS: we formalize the grouping problem, we design an efficient algorithm able to compute optimal fixed GTSs with respect to the distribution of ships' speeds, we provide a real-world data set with speeds of ships transiting the IRTC, and we compare the optimal fixed schedules with the currently deployed schedule and quantify possible savings. Additionally, we propose on-demand GTSs-customized schedules for a group of arriving ships-that take into account speeds, risk aversion, and actual positions of arriving ships. We formulate the problem of the optimal on-demand grouping as a biobjective mixed integer program, and we compute a set of Pareto optimal solutions. We evaluate the scalability of the approach, the structure of the solution, and quantify an improvement over the current GTS with respect to the number of ships grouped and the time saved.","horn of Africa,negative effect minimization,Marine navigation,Schedules,transportation,Marine vehicles,Delays,goods distribution,group transit schemes,integer programming,on-demand GTSs,scheduling,IRTC,Gulf of Aden,optimal fixed scheduling,time of arrival,ships,Oceans,mathematical programming,Pareto optimal solutions,global shipping industry,ship hijack probability minimization,optimal on-demand grouping,Optimization,International Recommended Transit Corridor,Histograms,contemporary maritime piracy,optimization,Algorithm design and analysis,biobjective mixed integer programming,security,"
"maritime environment perception based on deep learning","2022","Environment perception is an essential aspect of automated maritime vehicles, especially in high-traffic areas. In recent years, deep-learning-based object detection using LiDAR has been well developed in the automotive sector but has not yet seen a similar level of sophisticated development in maritime applications. In these applications, LiDAR detection should be fused with other maritime navigation systems such as the automatic identification system (AIS) to expand the detection range. To address this, we propose a novel deep-learning-based concept for maritime environment perception by using LiDAR as a primary sensor and AIS as an assisting information source. This approach consists of three functional modules: object detection, multi-object tracking, and static environment mapping. For object detection, we apply a convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect floating objects represented as oriented bounding boxes. To train the CNN, we propose a method that generates simulated labeled datasets. The detected objects from CNN are tracked with Kalman Filter banks. The remaining LiDAR data points are treated as static environments and represented by polygons. We evaluated the approach by using simulative and real-world datasets. In the simulation, the average precision of the CNN object detector reaches 60.8%, with a data processing rate of 40 Hz in GPU. Our real-world evaluations show that this approach can track 83% of the vessels in a crowded harbor, with the overall intersection over union reaching 64%. Our proposed approach represents the first application of CNN for LiDAR-based maritime environment perception, demonstrating its high potential for future online and real-world applications.","high-traffic areas,real-world applications,static environment mapping,Kalman filters,CNN object detector,automated maritime vehicles,deep-learning-based concept,static environments,Laser radar,neural nets,frequency 40.0 Hz,deep learning,object tracking,automatic identification system,LiDAR detection,Intelligent vessels,supervised learning,maritime navigation,AIS,object detection,sophisticated development,image classification,Radar tracking,Artificial intelligence,convolutional neural network,optical radar,Point cloud compression,Radar,maritime applications,maritime navigation systems,detection range,LiDAR-based maritime environment perception,multi-object tracking,Object detection,deep-learning-based object detection,multiobject tracking,learning (artificial intelligence),remaining LiDAR data points,Detectors,"

"influence of the geomagnetic field on the iact detection technique for possible sites of cta observatories","2013","We investigate the influence of the geomagnetic field (GF) on the Imaging Air Cherenkov Telescope technique for two northern (Tenerife and San Pedro Martir) and three southern (Salta, Leoncito and Namibia (the H.E.S.S.-site)) site candidates for Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) observatories. We use the CORSIKA and sim_telarray programs for Monte Carlo simulations of gamma ray showers, hadronic background and the telescope response. We focus here on gamma ray measurements in the low energy, sub-100GeV, range. Therefore, we only consider the performance of arrays of several large telescopes. Neglecting the GF effect, we find (in agreement with previous studies) that such arrays have lower energy thresholds, and larger collection areas below 30GeV, when located at higher altitudes. We point out, however, that in the considered ranges of altitudes and magnetic field intensities, 1800–3600m a.s.l. and 0–40μT, respectively, the GF effect has a similar magnitude to this altitude effect. We provide the trigger-level performance parameters of the observatory affected by the GF effect, in particular the collection areas, detection rates and the energy thresholds for all five locations, which information may be useful in the selection of sites for CTA. We also find simple scaling of these parameters with the magnetic field strength, which can be used to assess the magnitude of the GF effect for other sites; in this work we use them to estimate the performance parameters for five sites: South Africa-Beaufort West, USA-Yavapai Ranch, Namibia-Calapanzi, Chile-La Silla and India-Hanle. We roughly investigate the impact of the geophysical conditions on gamma/hadron separation procedures involving image shape and direction cuts. We note that the change of altitude has an opposite effect at the trigger and analysis levels, i.e. gains in triggering efficiency at higher altitudes are partially balanced by losses in the separation efficiency. In turn, a stronger GF spoils both the shape and the direction discrimination of gamma rays, thus its effects at the trigger and analysis levels add up resulting in a significant reduction of the observatory performance. Overall, our results indicate that the local GF strength at a site can be equally important as its altitude for the low-energy performance of CTA.","Cherenkov light,Imaging Air Cherenkov technique,Monte Carlo simulations,CTA observatory project,Cherenkov detectors,Geomagnetic field,Extensive Air Shower,"
"context-aware dynamic asset allocation for maritime interdiction operations","2020","This paper validates two approximate dynamic programming approaches on a maritime interdiction problem involving the allocation of multiple heterogeneous assets over a large area of responsibility to interdict multiple drug smugglers using heterogeneous types of transportation on the sea with varying contraband weights. The asset allocation is based on a probability of activity surface, which represents spatio-temporal target activity obtained by integrating intelligence data on drug smuggler whereabouts/waypoints for contraband transportation, behavior models, and meteorological and oceanographic information. We validate the proposed architectural and algorithmic concepts via several realistic mission scenarios. We conduct sensitivity analyses to quantify the robustness and proactivity of our approach, as well as to measure the value of information used in the allocation process.

"computationally effective range migration compensation in pcl systems for maritime surveillance","2018","In this paper, we consider the possibility of extending the coherent processing interval (CPI) as a way to improve target detection capability in passive radars for maritime surveillance applications. Despite the low velocity of the considered targets, range walk effects could limit the performance of the system when long CPIs are considered. To overcome these limitations while keeping the computational load controlled, we resort to a sub-optimal implementation of the Keystone Transform (KT), based on Lagrange polynomial interpolation, recently presented by the authors and successfully applied against aerial targets. Following those promising results, we extend the proposed approach to a coastal surveillance scenario. In the considered case, since longer CPI values are used, the proposed strategy appears to be even more attractive with respect to a conventional KT implementation based on the Chirp-Z Transform interpolation. In fact, comparable detection performance are obtained with a remarkable computational load saving. In detail, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated against experimental data provided by Leonardo S.p.A., using a DVB-T based passive radar.","Chirp-Z Transform interpolation,marine radar,aerial targets,radar detection,passive radars,passive radar,transforms,passive coherent location,interpolation,target tracking,range migration compensation,target detection capability,Computational complexity,polynomials,object detection,search radar,digital video broadcasting,radar imaging,Interpolation,computational load saving,PCL systems,Keystone Trasform,DVB-T based passive radar,long coherent processing interval,coherent processing interval,Lagrange polynomial interpolation,Keystone Transform,maritime surveillance applications,Passive radar,walk effects,Signal to noise ratio,Surveillance,CPI values,Transforms,coastal surveillance scenario,KT implementation,"
"large environmental disturbances caused by magmatic activity during the late devonian hangenberg crisis","2020","A wide range of various proxies (e.g., mineralogy, organic carbon, inorganic geochemistry, C and Mo isotopes, and framboidal pyrite) were applied for interpretation of changing oceanic redox conditions, bioproductivity, and the regional history of magmatic activity. This resulted in internally consistent interpretation of the late Famennian Hangenberg Crisis in subtropical deepest water sites of the epeiric Rhenohercynian and Saxo–Thuringian basins, as well as more open sites of the Paleo-Tethys Ocean. High mercury concentrations were detected in all of the studied sections, with the highest values strata in the Carnic Alps (up to 20 ppm) and Thuringia (up to 1.5 ppm). The beginning of the Hg anomaly and the presence of pyroclastic material, indicate that local magmatic activity was initiated before the deposition of the Hangenberg Black Shale (HBS). The onset of the HBS deposition coincided with the expansion of phosphate-enriched, anoxic to euxinic waters during short-lived CO2-greenhouse spike of a warm–humid climate. Intensive magmatic activity was a trigger for climatic changes, an excessive eutrophication, and an accelerated burial of organic carbon during the Hangenberg transgressive pulse. The injection of catastrophic amounts of CO2, toxic elements and acids from volcanic activity could have led to acidification, mutation of spores, and episodes of mass mortality of marine plankton.","Redox conditions,Carbon and molybdenum isotopes,Hangenberg Black Shale,Inorganic geochemistry,Volcanic activity,Mineralogical composition,"
"relations between climate change and mass movement: perspectives from the canadian cordillera and the european alps","2021","Earth's climate is warming and will continue to warm as the century progresses. High mountains and high latitudes are experiencing the greatest warming of all regions on Earth and also are some of the most sensitive areas to climate change, in part because ecosystems and natural processes in these areas are intimately linked to the cryosphere. Evidence is mounting that warming will further reduce permafrost and snow and ice cover in high mountains, which in turn will destabilize many slopes, alter sediment delivery to streams, and change subalpine and alpine ecosystems. This paper contributes to the continuing discussion of impacts of climate change on mountain environments by comparing and discussing processes and trends in the mountains of western Canada and the European Alps. We highlight the effects of physiography and climate on physical processes occurring in the two regions. Processes of interest include landslides and debris flows induced by glacier debuttressing, alpine permafrost thaw, changes in rainfall regime, formation and sudden drainage of glacier- and moraine-dammed lakes, ice avalanches, glacier surges, and large-scale sediment transfers due to rapid deglacierization. Our analysis points out the value of integrating observations and data from different areas of the world to better understand these processes and their impacts.","Cryosphere,Mass movement,European Alps,Canadian Cordillera,Climate change,"

"a strategy for detecting derelict fishing gear at sea","2012","Derelict fishing gear (DFG) is a highly persistent form of marine pollution known to cause environmental and economic damage. At-sea detection of DFG would support pelagic removal of this gear to prevent and minimize impacts on marine environments and species. In 2008, experts in marine debris, oceanography, remote sensing, and marine policy outlined a strategy to develop the capability to detect and ultimately remove DFG from the open ocean. The strategy includes three interrelated components: understanding the characteristics of the targeted DFG, indirectly detecting DFG by modeling likely locations, and directly detecting pelagic DFG using remote sensing. Together, these components aim to refine the search area, increase the likelihood of detection, and decrease mitigation response time, thereby providing guidance for removal operations. Here, we present this at-sea detection strategy, relate it to relevant extant research and technology, and identify gaps that currently prevent successful at-sea detection and removal of DFG.","Remote sensing,Marine debris,Derelict fishing gear,"
"butyltin residues in blue mussels (mytilus edulis) and arkshells (scapharca broughtonii) collected from korean coastal waters","2002","Butyltin compounds (BTs) including tributyltin (TBT) and its degradation products, di- (DBT) and mono-butyltin (MBT), were determined in bivalves such as blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) and arkshells (Scapharca broughtonii) collected from Korean coastal waters. BTs were detected in all the blue mussels and arkshells analyzed. The concentrations of total butyltin (ΣBTs: MBT+DBT+TBT) in blue mussels and arkshells ranged from 49 to 2500 ng/g and 29 to 87 ng/g wet weight, respectively. Higher concentrations of BTs were found in blue mussels collected from Okpo and Kohyonsong Bays and Jangsengpo Harbor where large shipyards and harbors are located with dry-dock facilities. This suggested that maritime activities nearby the harbors play a major role as the source of BTs. Concentrations of TBT in mussels collected from Korea were one of the highest values reported, suggesting ongoing TBT contamination in Korea. Among BTs, TBT was the predominant compound both in blue mussels and arkshells collected from almost all the sampling locations, indicating the fresh input of TBT in Korean coastal waters. Smaller mussels tended to accumulate BTs at higher concentrations than larger ones, which may be due to higher filtration rate of small mussels and/or contact with surface microlayer in intertidal zones.","Blue mussel (),Butyltin compounds,Korean coastal waters,Antifouling paint,TBT,"

"petrogeochemical assessment of rock units and identification of alteration/mineralization indicators using portable x-ray fluorescence measurements: applications to the fire tower zone (w-mo-bi) and the north zone (sn-zn-in), mount pleasant deposit, new brunswick, canada","2017","The Mount Pleasant polymetallic deposits are located along the southwestern margin of the Late Devonian Mount Pleasant Caldera Complex in southwestern New Brunswick, Canada. The Fire Tower Zone (W-Mo-Bi) and the North Zone (Sn-Zn-In) comprise the main mineralized zones within the Mount Pleasant deposit. The rock units examined at surface in both zones are highly altered and are surface weathered to some extent. In order to classify these rock units with confidence, the Olympus X-5000 portable X-ray Fluorescence (pXRF) spectrometer was used in this study to rapidly obtain the geochemical composition of these rocks, identify lithologic discriminants, and find alteration/mineralization indicators in these areas. The immobile elements Ti, Zr, Nb, Y, and Th were selected to discriminate among various rock types. The Little Mount Pleasant Formation has the highest Ti and Zr and the Mount Pleasant Granitic Suite (MPGS, GI and GII) contains the highest Y, Nb, and Th. The McDougall Brook Granitic Suite (MBGS) has an intermediate composition between them. The element ratios of Zr/Ti, Nb/Ti, Y/Ti, and Th/Ti effectively discriminate these rock units and increase from the Little Mount Pleasant Formation, to the MBGS, and then to the MPGS. Greisen and propylitic alteration are reflected by strong depletion of K and Rb in some samples. The Fe and Mn typically are leached out of the mineralization system during the greisen alteration. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed on the pXRF datasets. The first principal component (PC1) of the pXRF data from both the Fire Tower Zone and the North Zone mainly extracts information on Ti, Zr, Ce, Cr, V, Nb, Y, U, and Th, and thus represents different rock units. The PC2 is characterized by high-positive loadings of K, Rb, Fe, and Mn and negative loading of As and Mo. It is interpreted as the W-Mo mineralization indicator showing by the enrichment in Mo and depletion of K, Rb, Fe, and Mn associated with quartz+topaz+sericite+fluorite alteration. The PC3 consists of positive loadings of Sn, Zn, Cu, and S and slightly negative loadings of Sr and Ba, and thus represents the Sn-Zn mineralization in this area.","Immobile elements,Lithogeochemistry,XRF,PCA,Mount Pleasant deposit,"
"twenty years of nasa-eos multi-sensor satellite observations at kīlauea volcano (2000–2019)","2021","Recent eruptions of Kīlauea volcano, on the Island of Hawai'i, represent an ideal test location for studying volcanic plumes, due to its remote location and minimal anthropogenic pollution. Within this work we exploit the over 20-year data record from NASA EOS satellites to investigate the degree to which space-borne observations can detect shifts in known eruption dynamics at Kīlauea. Through the combined analysis of remotely sensed plume heights, plume particle microphysical properties, lava flow thermal tracking and high resolution SO2 mapping, we provide interpretations of the satellite signals in a volcanic context and link them to ground-based eruption reports for validation. We establish common patterns of plume dispersion and particle evolution and identify when significant shifts in activity occur. We also determine where ambient conditions influence the output retrieved from the space-borne sensors. By comparing the inferences derived from remote-sensing with the extensive record of suborbital observations at Kīlauea, we assess the strengths and limitations of the satellite-based volcanic assessment techniques. The work presented here highlights the capabilities of these techniques, allowing us to more confidently interpret volcanic activity observed from space globally, particularly in cases where ground observations are limited or entirely lacking.","Eruption tracking,Volcano remote sensing,Kīlauea,NASA earth observing system,TROPOMI,MODIS,MISR,"

"a wideband satellite maritime channel model simulator","2022","In this article, we present implementation details of a generative satellite maritime propagation channel model at L-band. In an earlier paper, we presented the parameterization of the channel model for the narrowband case based on recordings of GPS L1  $C/N_{0}$  time-series in different sea state conditions. Additionally, we performed wider band measurements using GPS E5a (â‰ˆ10 Mcpsâ€”chips per secondâ€” > 20 MHz bandwidth) and obtained estimations of power delay profiles. Due to lack of dynamic range and delay resolution, in these measurements, no conclusive information was gathered on the time spreading caused by the channel. What was clear is that the time spreading was not significant outside the first signal chip, i.e.,  $\approx 0.1~\mu \text{s}$ . Still wideband modeling is required within this spreading range. Now, we want to extend the model to the wideband case. To achieve this goal, we have used a rough surface scattering model applicable to sea surfaces and employed it to characterize the time dispersion to be expected. Additionally, we also used this scattering model to help verify the validity of the existing Doppler spread model. Furthermore, ship movements in the waves play a role. We try and analyze this issue.

"detection of aeromagnetic anomaly change associated with volcanic activity: an application of the generalized mis-tie control method","2009","Repeat aeromagnetic surveys may assist in mapping and monitoring long-term changes associated with volcanic activity. However, when dealing with repeat aeromagnetic survey data, the problem of how to extract the real change of magnetic anomalies from a limited set of observations arises, i.e. the problem of spatial aliasing. Recent development of the generalized mis-tie control method for aeromagnetic surveys flown at variable elevations enables us to statistically extract the errors from ambiguous noise sources. This technique can be applied to overcome the spatial alias effect when detecting magnetic anomaly changes between aeromagnetic surveys flown at different times. We successfully apply this technique to Asama Volcano, one of the active volcanoes in Japan, which erupted in 2004. Following the volcanic activity in 2005, we conducted a helicopter-borne aeromagnetic survey, which we compare here to the result from a previous survey flown in 1992. To discuss small changes in magnetic anomalies induced by volcanic activity, it is essential to estimate the accuracy of the reference and the repeat aeromagnetic measurements and the probable errors induced by data processing. In our case, the positioning inaccuracy of the 1992 reference survey was the most serious factor affecting the estimation of the magnetic anomaly change because GPS was still in an early stage at that time. However, our analysis revealed that the magnetic anomaly change over the Asama Volcano area from 1992 to 2005 exceeded the estimated error at three locations, one of which is interpreted as a loss of magnetization induced by volcanic activity. In this study, we suffered from the problem of positioning inaccuracy in the 1992 survey data, and it was important to evaluate its effect when deriving the magnetic anomaly change.","Magnetic anomaly change,V olcanic activity,Aeromagnetic anomalies,Asama Volcano,Mis-tie control method,"

"anomaly detection and assessment of pm10 functional data at several locations in the klang valley, malaysia","2015","In environmental data sets, the occurrence of a high concentration of an unusual pollutant, more formally known as an anomaly, may indicate air quality problems. Thus, a critical understanding of the behavior of anomalies is increasingly becoming very important for air pollution investigations. This study was conducted to detect anomalies in daily PM10 functional data, to investigate the patterns of behavior as well as to identify possible factors that determine PM10 anomalies at three selected air quality monitoring stations (Klang, Kuala Selangor and Petaling Jaya) in the Klang Valley, Malaysia. The statistical method employed to detect these anomalies consisted of a combination of the robust projection pursuit and the robust Mahalanobis distance methods using air quality data recorded from 2005 to 2010. Analysis of obtained anomalous PM10 profiles showed that data recorded during El Nino years (2005, 2006 and 2009) contained the highest frequency of anomalies. More frequent anomalies appeared during the southwest (SW) monsoon which occurs in the months of July and August as well as during the northeast (NE) monsoon in February. A lesser number of anomalies were also observed during weekends compared to weekdays. The weekend and monsoonal effect phenomena were shown to be significantly existent at all stations while wind speed was positively associated with extreme PM10 anomalies at the Klang and Petaling Jaya stations. In conclusion, anomalies detection was found useful for air pollution investigation in this study. The findings of this study imply that the location and background of a station, as well as wind speed, seasonal (monsoon) and weekdays-weekend variations play important role in influencing PM10 anomalies.","anomaly detection,air quality monitoring,PM,functional data,"
"a fault detector/classifier for closed-ring power generators using machine learning","2021","Condition-based monitoring of power-generation systems is naturally becoming a standard approach in industry due to its inherent capability of fast fault detection, thus improving system efficiency and reducing operational costs. Most such systems employ expertise-reliant rule-based methods. This work proposes a different framework, in which machine-learning algorithms are used for detecting and classifying several fault types in a power-generation system of dynamically positioned vessels. First, principal component analysis is used to extract relevant information from labeled data. A random-forest algorithm then learns hidden patterns from faulty behavior in order to infer fault detection from unlabeled data. Results on fault detection and classification for the proposed approach show significant improvement on accuracy and speed when compared to results from rule-based methods over a comprehensive database.","Random forests,Condition-based monitoring,Classification,Principal components,Machine learning,Detection,"
"energy-efficient task offloading of edge-aided maritime uav systems","2023","This paper considers the autonomous detecting and tracking task of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in the maritime environment. Due to the high computational complexity of the image-processing task, the strict latency requirement of the tracking task, and the shortage of batteries and computational capability of UAVs, the UAVs can offload the computing-intensive task to the edge computing server (ECS) to reduce the task latency and energy consumption. Even though, the large latency and energy consumption brought by some high-definition image-processing task still make some visual tracking difficult to perform. We first investigate the impact of video frame resolution on computing task size and detection accuracy, and further on task latency and energy consumption. In addition, we optimize the transmission power, the local CPU frequency, the offloading rate of UAVs, and the bandwidth allocation between UAVs. We model the UAVs tracking system as an energy consumption optimization problem with the constraint of task latency. Although the proposed optimization problem is complex, we transform the optimization problem into several subproblems with decoupling and rigorous mathematical proof. By combining the convex optimization with the genetic algorithm, an offloading algorithm with low complexity and good performance is obtained, which is verified by comparing with some benchmark offloading strategies in the numerical results.","unmanned aerial vehicles,Image edge detection,energy-efficient task offloading,remotely operated vehicles,image resolution,Energy consumption,convex programming,control engineering computing,bandwidth allocation,transmission power optimization,genetic algorithms,detection accuracy,edge computing server,genetic algorithm,Energy resolution,strict latency requirement,Target tracking,optimisation,edge computing,local CPU frequency,tracking task,UAV computational capability,visual tracking,high-definition image-processing task,mathematical proof,offload,visual target tracking,power aware computing,computing task size,edge-aided maritime UAV systems,autonomous aerial vehicles,Optimization,Edge computing,maritime environment,energy consumption,Image resolution,computational complexity,energy consumption optimization problem,Task analysis,computing-intensive task,ECS,UAV,"
"a multi-task learning-based framework for global maritime trajectory and destination prediction with ais data","2022","Automatic Identification System (AIS) was initially developed for tracking ships and avoiding collisions. As numerous small satellites were launched in recent years, millions of AIS messages are captured by these satellite AIS providers every day. The massive amount of data allow shipping firms and port operators to better predict vessels’ movement. In this study, a computational framework is developed to predict future trajectories and destinations of vessels by applying deep learning to the satellite AIS messages containing self-reporting positioning data. We employed deep learning approaches for large-scale maritime prediction and identifies the most suitable deep neural networks for this specific application. Three prediction models, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Dense Neural Networks (DNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) have been tested in the framework. A multi-task learning architecture is implemented based on test results. Through sharing parameters while training, this architecture enables long-term destination predictions by balancing short-term trajectory predictions. The framework is validated globally with the experiments covering five large-scale sea areas. The experimental results demonstrate that the LSTM model with an average accuracy percentage of 85.1% outperforms the CNN and DNN with accuracy percentages of 68.3% and 78.2% respectively. The LSTM model with multi-task architecture can achieve an accuracy of 87.0%. With the proposed computational framework, AIS data can be utilized for maritime predictions, supporting more complex marine applications and covering more expansive geographic areas.","Vessel trajectory prediction,Automatic Identification System,Vessel origin–destination analysis,Vessel destination prediction,"
"maritime ship target imaging with gnss-based passive multistatic radar","2023","In the field of maritime surveillance, the global navigation satellite system (GNSS)-based passive radar has proven its potential for moving target detection (MTD), localization, and velocity estimation. The next stage is to investigate the possibility of obtaining the radar image of the moving ship for target recognition. However, the limited signal power budget of GNSS prevents the conventional inverse synthetic aperture radar technique that is based on target rotational motion and short observation time for GNSS-based passive radar imaging moving target. In this article, a two-stage imaging processing method relying on the target translational motion over a long observation time is proposed. The first stage confirms the presence of the target by a long-time MTD processing technique. In the second stage, based on the analysis of the Doppler history of the target signal in the slow-time domain, short-time Fourier transform and modified random sample consensus are combined to robustly estimate target velocity with reduced computation complexity. To obtain the focused bistatic image, azimuth compression is conducted by using the estimated target velocity. Finally, an image fusion operation is implemented to combine the bistatic images achievable from multiple satellites so that a multistatic image with high quality can be created. The effectiveness of the proposed method is confirmed by the real experimental results of three cargo ships illuminated by several satellites.","moving ship,Fourier transforms,inverse synthetic aperture radar technique,focused bistatic image,GNSS-based passive multistatic radar,short-time Fourier transform,target detection,passive radar,Marine vehicles,image fusion operation,short observation time,long observation time,maritime ship target imaging,cargo ships,image fusion,target velocity estimation,ships,satellite navigation,maritime surveillance,estimated target velocity,two-stage imaging processing method,object detection,passive radar imaging,synthetic aperture radar,bistatic images,target rotational motion,radar imaging,Doppler effect,Radar,target translational motion,velocity estimation,Global navigation satellite system (GNSS)-based passive radar,Passive radar,Radar imaging,GNSS-based passive radar,target signal,Imaging,long-time MTD processing technique,slow-time domain,radar image,target recognition,multistatic image,Global navigation satellite system,global navigation satellite system-based passive radar,"
"ship classification based on ship behavior clustering from ais data","2019","Since the introduction of the Automatic Identification System (AIS), AIS data has proven to be a valuable source of ship behavior analysis using data mining. It records ship position, speed and other behavior attributes at specific time intervals in all voyages at sea and in ports. However, the current studies in ship behavior analyze the behavior patterns either with a subjective choice of classification for behavior differences among the groups of ships or without any classification at all. In order to fill this gap, a new methodology for ship classification in ports based on behavior clustering is developed by analyzing AIS data from the port of Rotterdam. Besides a proper data preparation, the proposed methodology consists of two steps: step I, clustering ship behavior in a port area and identifying the characteristics of the clusters; step II, classifying ships to such behavior clusters based on the ship characteristics. The clustering results present both the behavior patterns and the behavior change patterns for ship path and speed over ground, which are the dominant behavior attributes for ships in ports. Some patterns of integral ship behavior can also be revealed by investigating the correlation between the two behavior attributes. Our research has shown that length and beam can be adopted as explanatory variable to classify ships to the corresponding behavior clusters. The classifiers are developed based on both unsupervised discretization (equal width binning) and supervised discretization (Chi2). The performances of classifiers are compared by three evaluation metrics, including Average Accuracy, F1score, and AUC. We found that the classification based on multi-criteria is more accurate than using a single criterion. The classifications based on Chi2 discretization outperform the ones with equal width discretization. The outcome leads to a systematic understanding of ship behavior in a port area and can be used to predict the ship behavior pattern based on their characteristics and simulate the ship behavior.","Ship classification,Ports and waterways,Behavior clustering,Data mining,AIS data,"
"spatio-temporal dynamics of the río de la plata turbidity front; combining remote sensing with in-situ measurements and numerical modeling","2021","The Río de la Plata is a micro-tidal estuary located in Southeast South America. With an annual mean flow of 26,500 m3/s, it receives 160 million tons/yr of suspended sediments. The high content of cohesive fine sediments in the estuary generates high turbidity levels in its inner and intermediate zones, which can be clearly seen in color satellite images. In this work, an image-based algorithm was successfully implemented to remotely detect the turbidity front of the Río de la Plata, based on the top of the atmosphere (TOA) reflectance in the red band of MODIS-Aqua satellite. The algorithm finds the reflectance level that ‘best’ separates two water classes: turbid fluvial and clear ocean waters. The front dynamic was studied combining remotely sensed information and data of river discharge, winds, salinity and sea level time series, in the four-year period 2014–2017. River discharge was identified as the main external forcing, revealing a solid general pattern of behavior: when discharge was high (low) the front tended to be located in the outer (intermediate) zone of the estuary. Sea level seemed to be a secondary forcing, presenting higher correlations along the center of the estuary than near both coasts. Local winds needed to have a relatively persistent (2-day) component in a given direction to affect the location of the front. Additionally, results of an already implemented numerical model of the Río de la Plata were evaluated in terms of spatio-temporal performance, considering turbidity and salinity fronts locations. New strengths and limitations of the model were identified, and an improvement in the parameterization of sediments’ settling velocity was tested. Model results revealed the relative importance of bottom shear stress on the general location of the front, and of salinity on the flocculation process of cohesive sediments. This work provided new insights for the understanding of the Río de la Plata estuarine dynamics through the combination of three complementary tools – remote sensing, in situ data, and numerical modeling, – which may be extended to other systems around the world.","Satellite images,Discharge,Hydro-sedimentological model,Wind,Suspended sediments,Salinity,Sea surface level,Estuary,MODIS,"

"adaptive mission planning for cooperative autonomous maritime vehicles","2013","This paper addresses the problem of developing an autonomous cooperative multi-vehicle system composed of one simple low-cost unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV) guided by a more capable, sensor-equipped, surface or underwater vehicle. Specifically, in this work we consider a system composed of an autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) able to localize a small-sized UUV via a multibeam sonar and, then, to guide it via an acoustic link to reach a target. The UUV is equipped with low-cost navigation sensors (a compass and a depth sensor), and to estimate its own position relies on the data received by the ASV (range and bearing from the ASV and ASV position). This paradigm was applied in the domain of mine countermeasures (MCM) to realize the NATO CMRE Autonomous Mine Neutralization System. In this system the low-cost feature of the UUV is of the most importance since the UUV is supposed to be expendable. In this approach, however, there may be cases in which the underwater vehicle cannot be detected by the sonar for extended time periods causing drifts in the UUV position estimate, potentially compromising the mission. This paper presents a set of behaviors to address this situation. The behaviors coordinate ASV circular search patterns together with sending to the UUV purposely generated navigation updates. The aim is to limit the distance between the two vehicles, increasing the probability of sonar reacquisition, and at the same time ensuring that the UUV progresses toward the target. Results from sea trials held in Elba island (Italy) during ANT12 experiments (in June 2012) are reported, and demonstrate the approach is effective and can push our system toward full autonomy.","autonomous cooperative multivehicle system,mine countermeasures domain,low-cost navigation sensors,ANT12 experiments,multi-robot systems,control engineering computing,small-sized UUV,NATO CMRE Autonomous Mine Neutralization System,ASV position bearing,Elba island,Italy,Sonar navigation,navigation updates,Vehicles,sonar reacquisition probability,autonomous surface vehicle,Three-dimensional displays,software architecture,adaptive mission planning,autonomous underwater vehicles,simple low-cost unmanned underwater vehicle,time periods,ASV circular search patterns,compass,Sonar,vehicle distance,sensors,sonar,multibeam sonar,Acoustics,depth sensor,path planning,cooperative autonomous maritime vehicles,ASV,mobile robots,MCM domain,Sensors,ASV position range,acoustic link,sensor position estimation,"
"mining regular behaviors based on multidimensional trajectories","2016","In the information fusion domain, mining regular behaviors is very important to task classification, anomaly behavior detection, situation assessment and threat estimation. Through clustering multidimensional trajectories which are accumulated in all kinds of electronic information systems, regular behaviors could be mined. Most of the trajectories clustering methods are clustering spatial position closed trajectories to a cluster. They cannot distinguish behaviors whose space position is similar but the moving speed and direction are quite different. Some sub-trajectory clustering methods which presented similarity measures considering segment direction, speed, and angle could solve this problem, but they are not suitable to some application scenarios which should clustering the whole trajectories. In this paper, we proposed a multidimensional trajectory clustering algorithm to mine regular behaviors by considering the attribute, type, position, velocity and course characteristics, and implement it on two experiments. This research is very helpful for mining all the regular behaviors in different application scenarios and would have a wide prospect in expert and intelligent systems.","Hausdorff distance,Multidimensional trajectory,Clustering,Regular behavior,"

Two multi-institutional, multi-instrument campaigns, one under ‘Space Weather: Science and Applications’ and the other emphasizing tides under ‘Atmospheric Coupling Processes’ were conducted during February–April 2006. The highlights of the campaigns include improved prediction of equatorial spread-F (ESF) based on a ‘new factor’ combining the strength and asymmetry of the equatorial ionization anomaly (EIA); simultaneous detection of quasi-2-day wave at both E and F region heights; tomographic image showing a Traveling Ionospheric Disturbance (TID) in association with a counter electrojet (CEJ) event—all highlighting the neutral and electrodynamical coupling of the equatorial ionosphere−thermosphere regions; an unusual lowering of mesospheric temperature during a moderate geomagnetic storm—highlighting a new space weather effect; diurnal tide showing a peak amplitude of 35m/s at 45km in zonal wind and a significantly lower amplitude (∼15m/s) in the meridional wind and also evidence of convective activity in the lower atmosphere influencing the tidal variability in the Mesosphere−Lower Thermosphere (MLT) region highlighting the vertical coupling of the atmospheric regions. The development of models for equatorial and low latitude ionosphere has been among the prime activities taken up under ‘Space Climate’. Two models have been developed towards this end: one based on Second Degree (SD) relationships of F region parameters to the mean sun spot number and the other a Multiple Regression Analysis (MRA) based model involving expressions relating F region parameters to that representing solar and geomagnetic activities. The two models, intended for long and short term predictions, have been found to represent the equatorial and low latitude ionosphere over Indian longitudes better than the commonly used International Reference Ionosphere (IRI).

"perturbation analysis for maritime applications","2012","Target detection of marine features is a major topic for the security and monitoring of coastlines. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) has been shown to be particularly useful because of its all-weather and night capability. In this paper a methodology based on the perturbation analysis developed by the authors is presented. The latter can be applied for detection of ships (non-marine targets) or classification of sea ice. The algorithm can be considered to be a negative filter focused on sea. Consequently, all the features which have a polarimetric behaviour different from the sea are detected and considered as targets. A complete validation with RADARSAT-2 full polarimetric data was performed in Portsmouth, UK. An accurate ground truth carried out during the acquisition, was accompanied, considering AIS GPS location and photographic evidences.

"deep learning aided beam vector assignment for massive mimo maritime communication considering location information and handover impact","2022","Location aided beamforming (LAB) has been proposed as a potential solution to fast beam vector (BV) selection for massive multi-input multi-output (M-MIMO) maritime communication systems. However, the existing LAB schemes hardly consider the impact from handover. In this paper, we propose to apply the Gaussian anomaly detection (GAD) to improve the system performance, particularly in the handover zone, by exploiting the information of sea lane and locations of the user equipment (UE). Furthermore, inspired by the rationale of deep learning (DL) aided image processing methods, we first transform the BV assignment problem to a location-based artificial gray value classification problem, and then utilize a convolutional deep belief networks (CDBN) to predict the BV indices from a predefined codebook constituted by location-related feature matrices. In addition, we exploit GAD to rectify the training data of CDBN, such that the prediction on BV assignments can be more accurate to achieve a higher capacity than known methods. Finally, an extensive comparison with selected existing schemes through simulations demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.","Convolutional deep belief network (CDBN),Maritime communication,Deep learning (DL),Massive multiple input multiple output (M-MIMO),Gaussian anomaly detection (GAD),"

"designing intelligent coastal surveillance based on big maritime data","2020","The ocean is classified into several territorial regimes that span from internal waters, archipelagic waters, territorial seas, contiguous zones, exclusive economic zones (EEZ), and high seas.

Furthermore, the accurate understanding of the historical traffic enables the classification and prediction of vessel behaviours as well as the detection of low-likelihood behaviours, or anomalies.

"discovering maritime traffic route from ais network","2016","The recent build-up network of Automatic Identification System (AIS) equipped on vessels provides a rich source of vessel movement information. AIS is originally designed for automatically exchanging navigation information, such as their unique identification, position, course, and speed, with nearby vessels and terrestrial receivers to affect collision avoidance and safety control. The collected sequences of AIS logs can be considered as maritime trajectory data, i.e., the sequences of location points with timestamps. This vast amount of AIS trajectory data can be collected and employed to achieve an awareness of maritime traffic knowledge. This paper is devoted to discovery of maritime traffic route from trajectory data generated by AIS networks. However, AIS trajectory data discovery is a challenging task because of the trajectory data is available with uncertainty. Furthermore, unlike the vehicles' movements are constrained by road networks, there is no such a sea route for vessels to follow in marine areas. To overcome the challenges, we propose a framework of Maritime Traffic Route Discovery (abbreviated as MTRD) to generate pattern-aware routes to achieve an effective understanding of maritime traffic awareness. The proposed framework is evaluated on real AIS data and the experimental results shows that the proposed MTRD is able to extract the marine traffic route effectively and provides a cornerstone of maritime traffic knowledge for traffic management, anomaly detection, and conflict analysis in the future.","data mining,MTRD,AIS trajectory data discovery,terrestrial receivers,anomaly detection,AIS logs,traffic management,marine navigation,Global Positioning System,vessel movement information,Trajectory pattern mining,Trajectory data,Electronic mail,AIS network,maritime traffic knowledge,automatic identification system,marine safety,location point sequences,maritime trajectory data,Artificial intelligence,safety control,vehicle movements,maritime traffic route discovery,Roads,Trajectory,Uncertainty,traffic engineering computing,AIS trajectory data,AIS System,Maritime Traffic knowledge,automatic navigation information exchange,collision avoidance,conflict analysis,Data mining,maritime traffic awareness,Traffic Route Discovery,"

Electromagnetic diversity is proposed as an electromagnetic resilience measure to deal with such EMI induced failures already at the network level.","Safety,Autonomous Systems,Resilience,EMI induced failures,electromagnetic interference induced failures,electromagnetic resilience measure,marine safety,Electromagnetic interference,Electromagnetics,network level,position control,risk management,electromagnetic interference,network connection safety,involved network connection,electromagnetic diversity,maritime use case,Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC),EM Resilience,maritime environment,risk-based approach,network communication,marine communication,Electromagnetic Interference (EMI),Control systems,failure analysis,marine control,dynamic positioning control system,"
"change in silica sources in roman and post-roman glass","2003","Although Roman and post-Empire glasses found in Europe are reputed to have a very constant composition and hence source of components, it appears that some 4–5th century and later specimens show evidence of a different source of silica (sand) component. Zirconium and titanium are the discriminating elements. Data presented here for 278 specimens from 1st to 4th century German and Belgian samples indicate a strongly homogeneous Zr and Ti content; N: number of analyzed samples while 62 samples from Maastricht show low Zr–Ti contents from 1st to 3rd century samples while 4–5th century samples show a strong trend of concomitant Ti and Zr increase. If the high values of Zr–Ti represent a new source of silica (sand) the trend from low to high content suggests that a significant amount of low Zr–Ti glass was recycled to form these glass objects. Similar high Ti content can be seen in analysis results reported for other but not all 4–5th century samples found in northern Europe while earlier productions show typical low Ti contents. Although the fusing agent for these glasses seems to have always been natron (a mineral deposit in the Nile delta) from Hellenistic times to the 9th century, a change in the silica source, indicated by variation of the Ti and Zr content, could very well reflect the results of political instability of the 4–5th century exemplified by the fragmentation of the Roman Empire into two parts.","Silica sources,Roman and post-Roman glass,Glass objects,"
"beidou-based passive multistatic radar maritime moving target detection technique via spaceâ€“time hybrid integration processing","2022","This article puts forward a BeiDou-based passive multistatic radar (PMR) maritime moving target (MMT) detection technique via spaceâ€“time hybrid integration (STHI) processing. Compared with passive bistatic radar (PBR), the utilization of multiple satellites provides an improvement in MMT detection performance, together with the capabilities of localization and velocity estimation. However, the multiple satellite transmitters cause the differences principally in bistatic range and Doppler centroid (DC) of the MMT. To integrate the PMR echoes, the biggest challenge is the two differences that need to be handled. In the proposed technique, first, the centroid-compensated keystone transform (CCKT) is proposed and applied to each PBR echo. It not only corrects range cell migration (RCM) but also equalizes the DC to the same. Then, the long-time integration is performed on each PBR echo, after which it is integrated into the range-Doppler frequency rate (DFR) domain. Finally, in order to settle the difference in bistatic range, an MMT position and velocity domain (i.e., the  $X$ â€“ $Y$ â€“ $V$  domain) is constituted. The obtained multiple range-DFR maps are projected to the  $X$ â€“ $Y$ â€“ $V$  domain, and then, the effective integration of multistatic echoes can be implemented. The final STHI result allows detecting the MMT reliably. Meanwhile, according to the 3-D position where the MMT is located in the  $X$ â€“ $Y$ â€“ $V$  domain, the MMT can be localized, and its velocity can be estimated simultaneously. In May 2021, we have successfully carried out the worldâ€™s first BeiDou-based PMR MMT detection experiment, and the experimental results are given to prove the effectiveness of this technique.","Satellites,MMT position,range cell migration,marine radar,MMT detection performance,radar detection,passive radar,PBR echo,RCM,transforms,passive bistatic radar,Radio transmitters,STHI processing,BeiDou-based PMR MMT detection technique,space-time hybrid integration processing,satellite navigation,centroid-compensated keystone transform,maritime surveillance,maritime moving target (MMT) detection,object detection,BeiDou-based passive radar,spaceâ€“time hybrid integration (STHI),PMR echoes,bistatic range,Doppler effect,multistatic echoes,Doppler centroid,Satellite broadcasting,range-Doppler frequency rate domain,multiple satellite transmitters,Doppler radar,Passive radar,BeiDou-based passive multistatic radar maritime moving target detection technique,Receivers,spaceborne radar,CCKT,Multistatic radar,passive multistatic radar (PMR),radar cross-sections,range-DFR domain,multiple range-DFR maps,"
"information fusion and tracking using bernoulli filters for maritime surveillance","2022","This paper concerns the application of information fusion and Bernoulli filtering to a maritime surveillance scenario. Sensor data was recorded during live trials featuring a static Leonardo Osprey maritime surveillance active electronic scan array (AESA) radar observing a cooperative rigid inflatable boat (RIB) target deployed in the Firth of Forth estuary north of Edinburgh, UK. The RIB was equipped with a global positioning system (GPS) and an automatic identification system (AIS) recording geodetic position over time, where the collected data is fused to generate ground truth. A multi-target joint detection and tracking (MTJDT) algorithm is used to both detect and track the RIB target from post-processed radar and AIS data whilst ignoring other information regarding objects and sources of interference. Generalised optimal sub-pattern assignment (GOSPA) and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis are used to evaluate target detection, localisation, and cardinality performance quantification. Results suggest conventional data processing and the proposed tracking algorithm achieve reasonable detection and tracking performance under the assumption that the ground truth well-represents the RIB position without knowledge of error statistics, but track divergence and discontinuities occur due to radar obscuration by buildings, data inaccuracies and clutter.","maritime surveillance scenario,sensor fusion,marine radar,reasonable detection,geodetic position,multitarget joint detection,target detection,Global Positioning System,information fusion,information regarding objects,target tracking,global positioning system,image fusion,sensor data,automatic identification system,data inaccuracies,filtering theory,boats,RIB target,static Leonardo Osprey maritime surveillance active electronic scan array radar,object detection,radar interference,video recording,radar imaging,radar receivers,bernoulli filters,conventional data processing,radar tracking,clutter,radar obscuration,post processed radar,rigid inflatable boat target,video surveillance,track divergence,RIB position,AIS data,"
"moving ship optimal association for maritime surveillance: fusing ais and sentinel-2 data","2022","Nowadays, a variety of different sources can be combined together to measure and monitor maritime human activities. Reliable data fusion techniques are essential to associate the targets from different systems for maritime surveillance. In particular, the fusion of data from Sentinel-2 satellites and the automatic identification system (AIS) has attracted wide attention due to their public availability and complementarity. However, most traditional methods for target association are not suitable for this particular case, due to the time lag phenomenon of Sentinel-2 data. In this study, we first construct two new datasets for the detection of moving ships and their wakes based on Sentinel-2 images. Combined with the detection results obtained by the you only look once (YOLOv5) model, the position and course information of the detected ships are first extracted. After carefully analyzing the time lag phenomenon of Sentinel-2 data, we develop a new domain adaptation-based method for target association based on the fusion of Sentinel-2 and AIS data, called moving ship optimal association (MSOA). Different from standard domain adaptation methods only for representation alignment, the proposed MSOA is able to align representation, time, and position simultaneously. A case study is provided in which the newly proposed method is tested over the Port of Long Beach, USA. Experimental results demonstrate that both moving ships and wakes are well detected. Specifically, our newly proposed MSOA exhibits more accurate and robust performance when compared to traditional methods, and the detected ships without corresponding AIS tracks can also be detected by our MSOA. Moreover, the real sensing time and time lag of Sentinel-2 data are deduced with high accuracy. Overall, it can be concluded that our MSOA provides a new perspective for accurate target association based on heterogeneous data fusion.","surveillance,Remote sensing,sensor fusion,remote sensing,MSOA,time lag,ship detection,detected ships,heterogeneous data fusion,Marine vehicles,domain adaptation,ship optimal association,Data fusion,accurate target association,geophysical image processing,Sentinel-2 images,target tracking,Optical sensors,ships,time lag phenomenon,maritime surveillance,Target tracking,target association,you only look once (YOLO),Artificial intelligence,radar tracking,moving ships,Sentinel-2 satellites,Sensors,Surveillance,maritime surveillance (MS),domain adaptation-based method,reliable data fusion techniques,AIS data,Sentinel-2 data,"
"a framework for maritime anti-collision pattern discovery from ais network","2019","The avoidance of collisions between ships in encounter situations is crucial to maritime traffic safety. Most research on maritime collision avoidance has focused on planning a safe path by which to avoid approaching ships in accordance with the requirements laid out in the International Regulations for Preventing Collision at Sea (COLREGs). The resulting solution provides reference for the navigator in planning movements to avoid collisions. Nonetheless, specific anti-collision actions are generally based on the experience of the navigator. This study differed from existing works in that we sought to derive collision avoidance behavior from the trajectory data of actual ships. The Automatic Identification System (AIS) network makes it possible to collect an enormous volume of trajectory data and investigate real-world ship behavior. Unfortunately trajectory data that introduces uncertainty can hinder behavior mining for collision avoidance. Irregular and/or asynchronous location sampling can lead to situations in which the movement of a ship does not necessarily follow a given trajectory, even if its movement behavior is similar to that of other ships. In this study, we developed a framework to decipher the anti-collision behavior of ships in encounter situations from a large database of trajectory data collected by AIS network, and to present this behavior in the form of anti-collision patterns. A prototype of the proposed framework was built to enable pattern analysis and visualization functions, thereby providing a deeper understanding of collision avoidance behavior in maritime traffic. The proposed framework is applicable to the development of pattern-aware collision avoidance systems aimed at improving maritime traffic safety.","maritime conflict detection,real-world ship behavior,Safety,Marine vehicles,ship anti-collision pattern,pattern-aware collision avoidance systems,ship trajectory data,behavior mining,AIS network,ships,marine safety,maritime collision avoidance,Collision avoidance,Artificial intelligence,automatic identification system network,Trajectory,collision avoidance behavior,anti-collision behavior,International Regulations for Preventing Collision at Sea,maritime traffic safety,Navigation,collision avoidance,Data mining,maritime anti-collision pattern discovery,"

"optimal auv trajectory planning and execution control for maritime pollution incident response","2021","Marine pollution incidents can have a huge impact on different ecosystems, with unpredictable short- and long-term consequences. Once the pollutant is detected, it is critical to quickly understand its characteristics so that authorities can lay out an adequate response. In parallel to the time- and cost-constrained traditional operational means, this paper suggests the use of AUVs for the sampling procedures of marine pollution incidents, to increase the speed and efficiency of operations. A new software architecture is developed, integrating trajectory optimization for AUVs into a software toolchain that allows human operators to plan, simulate, and control multiple vehicles deployments.

Recently, it has been suggested that GNSS-R can also be used for ship detection applications. To this purpose, an accurate electromagnetic modeling of the bistatic radar cross section of a ship lying over the sea surface would be very helpful. However, existing models are typically limited to monostatic configurations, thus restricting their applicability in multistatic scenarios, such as GNSS-R systems.

"comparison of target detectors to identify icebergs in quad- polarimetric sar alos-2 images","2021","Icebergs represent hazards to ships and maritime activities and therefore their detection is essential. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellites are very useful for this, due to their capability to acquire under cloud cover and during polar nights. Additionally, polarimetry has been proven to improve the detection capability. In this work, we compare six state-of-the-art quad polarimetric detectors to test their performance and ability to detect small sized icebergs in four locations in Greenland. These were the polarimetric notch filter (PNF), polarimetric match filter (PMF), polarimetric whitening filter (PWF), optimal polarimetric detector (OPD), reflection symmetry detector, and the dual polarisation anomaly detector (iDPolRAD). We use four single look complex ALOS-2 quad pol images. The data were calibrated and processed. We produce the covariance matrices of each image before applying a testing and training window for detection. We also add a guard window to reduce false alarms.

"path orthogonal matching pursuit for sparse reconstruction and denoising of swir maritime imagery","2018","We introduce an extension that may be used to augment algorithms used for the sparse decomposition of signals into a linear combination of atoms drawn from a dictionary such as those used in support of, for example, compressive sensing, k-sparse representation, and denoising. Our augmentation may be applied to any reconstruction algorithm that relies on the selection and sorting of high-correlation atoms during an analysis or identification phase by generating a 'path' between the two highest-correlation atoms. Here we investigate two types of path: a linear combination (Euclidean geodesic) and a construction relying on an optimal transport map (2-Wasserstein geodesic). We test our extension by performing image denoising and k-sparse representation using atoms from a learned overcomplete kSVD dictionary. We study the application of our techniques on SWIR imagery of maritime vessels and show that our methods outperform orthogonal matching pursuit. We conclude that these methods, having shown success in our two tested problem domains, will also be useful for reducing 'basis mismatch' error that arises in the recovery of compressively sampled images.","image denoising,Matching pursuit algorithms,path orthogonal matching pursuit,highest-correlation atoms,Image reconstruction,compressively sampled images,SWIR maritime imagery,high-correlation atoms,Euclidean geodesic,Dictionaries,image matching,image representation,linear combination,SWIR imagery,2-Wasserstein geodesic,orthogonal matching pursuit,Standards,Noise reduction,compressed sensing,optimal transport map,image reconstruction,Correlation,learned overcomplete kSVD dictionary,compressive sensing,k-sparse representation,reconstruction algorithm,sparse reconstruction,Imaging,learning (artificial intelligence),identification phase,"
"infrared maritime target detection based on iterative corner and edge weights in tensor decomposition","2023","High-precision infrared maritime target detection plays an important role in early warning, monitoring, search, and rescue. The methods of decomposing the original image into low-rank background components and sparse target components show favorable detection performance. However, the strong edge interference is also sparse and may be mistakenly taken as target components, resulting in a large number of false alarms and reducing detection accuracy. To solve the problem, we propose an iterative corner and edge weights method based on tensor decomposition. The original image is decomposed into the background component, target component, and additional strong edge interference component. The corner strength is designed as the weight of the target component, and the edge strength is designed as the weight of the interference component in order to separate the target and interference more accurately. And the two weights are designed to be updated during each iteration of the model solution to reduce the impact of initial imprecise weights on detection results. Compared with 8 advanced baseline methods in 10 datasets, the proposed method demonstrates outstanding results and shows engineering application prospects.","Image edge detection,maritime target detection,iterative corner,edge weights method,background component,edge strength,Solid modeling,edge detection,tensors,interference suppression,detection accuracy reduction,target component,initial imprecise weights,corner strength,false alarms,object detection,Infrared small target detection,low-rank background components,tensor decomposition,iterative weight,sparse target components,Tensors,Iterative methods,Object detection,Interference,favorable detection performance,strong edge interference component,Analytical models,"
"a design framework for a system of digital twins and services","2023","Digital twins represent physical systems in virtual space to enable knowledge intensive tasks. For complex physical systems, effective digital integration can often be achieved by means of a system of aggregated digital twins coupled with a services network. Designing such a system of digital twins and services involves a daunting array of options and considerations. This paper presents a design framework that facilitates systematic, effective decisions when designing a system of digital twins to integrate the data from a complex physical system. The design framework is arranged in six steps: 1) needs and constraints analysis, 2) physical system decomposition, 3) services allocation, 4) performance and quality considerations, 5) implementation considerations and 6) verification and validation. The design framework works with a general reference architecture that combines a digital twin aggregation hierarchy with a service-oriented architecture. This reference architecture allows for the separation of concerns, computational load distribution, incremental development and modular software design. The paper considers the merits of the design framework using two illustrative case studies, i.e. a heliostat field and a smart city. The case studies indicate that the design framework can be applied to a wide range of complex systems and can improve the effectiveness of the design process.","Design framework,Aggregation,Service-oriented architecture,Complex system,Digital twin,"
"novel climates: trajectories of climate change beyond the boundaries of british columbia’s forest management knowledge system","2018","The non-stationary climates of the 21st century are compelling forest managers to seek non-local species, provenances, and silvicultural regimes that are better suited to the anticipated future climates of their operating areas. Ideally, forest managers can source this information from climate analogs within their jurisdictions, but the emergence of unfamiliar climates is a distinct possibility with particular challenges. Here, we present an assessment of the emergence of mid-21st-century climates with no analog in the 20th-century climates of British Columbia (BC), and the extent to which these novel climates are described by climate analogs elsewhere in North America. We use a recently developed linear method of novel climate detection in parallel with Random Forest classification to evaluate the robustness of novel climate inferences. Our results suggest that a majority of the province’s area will remain free of novel climates over this time period, and therefore that BC’s ecological knowledge system, the Biogeoclimatic Ecosystem Classification, can remain the dominant source of climate analogs for mid-21st-century forest management planning horizons. Nevertheless, we detected a robust pattern of climates that are novel to BC in mid-21st-century climate projections at low elevations in the coastal, southern interior, and northeastern regions of the province. There appears to be potential to inform forest management in some of these novel climates with analogs from adjacent states and provinces. We demonstrate that extrapolations into novel climates typically understate the magnitude of climate change and modeling uncertainty, creating a false impression of robust predictions in locations where model performance is poorest. By identifying portions of their landscapes that are prone to emergence of novel climates, forest managers can avoid management errors and prioritize the search for analogs beyond the boundaries of their knowledge systems.","Mahalanobis distance,Bioclimate,No-analog,Novel climates,Random Forest,Biogeoclimatic ecosystem classification,"

"the significance of spectral position in the rhodopsins of tropical marine fishes","1973","Visual pigments were extracted from the retinae of a large and diverse sample (179 species, in 40 families) of tropical marinefishes. By the method of partial bleaching, most of these were found to be retinal-1 pigments, with their maxima tightly grouped between 489 and 502 nm; but a few have λmax at shorter wavelengths. The spectral position of these pigments does not correlate with diurnal or nocturnal activity patterns, nor do closely related species necessarily have similar pigments. In general, the deeper-living species have rhodopsins with λmax at shorter wavelengths, a correlation with the bluer quality of light in deeper water. The spectral distribution of light was measured in air and underwater at a coral atoll. During twilight the underwater spectrum narrows and shifts to shorter wavelengths, as a result of increased absorption of yellow-orange light by the atmosphere. This effect at twilight is unique among the general spectral events that constitute each day. The behavioral patterns of reef fishes make clear the relationships between underwater light and the visual pigments. During evening twilight, there is an orderly sequence, in which the diurnal fishes seek cover, and then, after a “Quiet Period”, the nocturnal species emerge. The “Quiet Period” is the most critical and visually difficult time because light intensities are transitional between the thresholds of photopic and scotopic vision. Predation reaches a maximum during the “Quiet Period”. The rhodopsins of all these fishes tend to match the background light available during evening and morning twilight. Photochemically, visual sensitivity is maximized and, as a result, predation is held in check. The relationships between light, behavior and visual physiology are discussed. Although their rhodopsins are spectrally similar to those of the prey, crepuscular predators obtain a visual advantage by having moderate numbers of very large cones, which provide adequate sensitivity and sufficient resolution for motion detection.

"asynchronous trajectory matching-based multimodal maritime data fusion for vessel traffic surveillance in inland waterways","2023","The automatic identification system (AIS) and video cameras have been widely exploited for vessel traffic surveillance in inland waterways. The AIS data could provide vessel identity and dynamic information on vessel position and movements. In contrast, the video data could describe the visual appearances of moving vessels without knowing the information on identity, position, movements, etc. To further improve vessel traffic surveillance, it becomes necessary to fuse the AIS and video data to simultaneously capture the visual features, identity, and dynamic information for the vessels of interest. However, the performance of AIS and video data fusion is susceptible to issues such as data spatial difference, message asynchronous transmission, visual object occlusion, etc. In this work, we propose a deep learning-based simple online and real-time vessel data fusion method (termed DeepSORVF). We first extract the AIS-and video-based vessel trajectories, and then propose an asynchronous trajectory matching method to fuse the AIS-based vessel information with the corresponding visual targets. In addition, by combining the AIS-and video-based movement features, we also present a prior knowledge-driven anti-occlusion method to yield accurate and robust vessel tracking results under occlusion conditions. To validate the efficacy of our DeepSORVF, we have also constructed a new benchmark dataset (termed FVessel) for vessel detection, tracking, and data fusion. It consists of many videos and the corresponding AIS data collected in various weather conditions and locations. The experimental results have demonstrated that our method is capable of guaranteeing high-reliable data fusion and anti-occlusion vessel tracking.

"application of the jpda-ukf to hfsw radars for maritime situational awareness","2012","At the present day, growing interest is paid to the development of more reliable surveillance systems for maritime situational awareness (MSA). The purpose is to detect, track and classify cooperative and non-cooperative targets. For this reason, great interest is given to low-power/cost High-Frequency Surface-Wave (HFSW) radars as an early-warning tool for over-the-horizon (OTH) applications. However, in HFSW radars there is a trade-off in terms of quality and cost, i.e. the radar system exhibits poor azimuth resolution, high non-linearity, and significant false alarm rate. All these aspects reduce tracking performance if not properly addressed. In this context, the Joint Probabilistic Data Association (JPDA) with the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) is proposed. The tracking algorithm behavior is investigated by a comparison between the tracks generated by two HFSW radars, with overlapped fields of view, and Automatic Identification System (AIS) data.

"data-driven trajectory quality improvement for promoting intelligent vessel traffic services in 6g-enabled maritime iot systems","2021","Future generation communication systems, such as 5G and 6G wireless systems, exploit the combined satellite-terrestrial communication infrastructures to extend network coverage and data throughput for data-driven applications. These ground-breaking techniques have promoted the rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT) in maritime industries. In maritime IoT applications, intelligent vessel traffic services can be guaranteed by collecting and analyzing high volume of spatial data flows from automatic identification system (AIS). This AIS system includes a highly integrated automatic equipment, including functionalities of core communication, tracking, and sensing. The increased utilization of shipboard AIS devices allows the collection of massive trajectory data. However, the received raw AIS data often suffers from undesirable outliers (i.e., poorly tracked timestamped points for vessel trajectories) during signal acquisition and analog-to-digital conversion. The degraded AIS data will bring negative effects on vessel traffic services (e.g., maritime traffic monitoring, intelligent maritime navigation, vessel collision avoidance, etc.) in maritime IoT scenarios. To improve the quality of vessel trajectory records from AIS networks, we propose to develop a two-phase data-driven machine learning framework for vessel trajectory reconstruction. In particular, a density-based clustering method is introduced in the first phase to automatically recognize the undesirable outliers. The second phase proposes a bidirectional long short-term memory (BLSTM)-based supervised learning technique to restore the timestamped points degraded by random outliers in vessel trajectories. Comprehensive experiments on simulated and realistic data sets have verified the dominance of our two-phase vessel reconstruction framework compared to other competing methods. It thus has the capacity of promoting intelligent vessel traffic services in 6G-enabled maritime IoT systems.","short-term memory-based supervised learning technique,maritime traffic monitoring,recurrent neural nets,supervised learning technique,intelligent maritime navigation,data-driven applications,AIS networks,Internet of Things,Monitoring,neural networks,6G-enabled maritime IoT systems,vessel collision avoidance,time stamped point restoration,shipboard AIS devices,BLSTM,two-phase vessel reconstruction framework,spatial data,5G mobile communication,automatic identification system,maritime IoT applications,supervised learning,vessel traffic services,signal reconstruction,intelligent vessel traffic services,6G mobile communication,pattern clustering,vessel trajectories,Artificial intelligence,analogue-digital conversion,two-phase data-driven machine,raw AIS data system,telecommunication traffic,maritime Internet of Things (IoT),6G wireless systems,integrated automatic equipment,Trajectory,signal detection,vessel trajectory reconstruction,marine communication,automatic identification system (AIS),Navigation,maritime industries,bidirectional long short-term memory,combined satellite-terrestrial communication,data-driven trajectory quality improvement,massive trajectory data,future generation communication systems,"

"a general orthogonal transform aided mimo design for reliable maritime visible light communications","2020","In maritime visible light communication (VLC) systems, user information is delivered among different terminals distributed in the atmosphere, and the underwater environment. To combat the complex and variant marine channel conditions induced by the absorption, scattering, and turbulence influence, in this article, we propose a general orthogonal transform (OT) aided multiple input multiple output (MIMO) transmission scheme to enhance the transmission reliability performances. In our design, we propose to construct the orthogonal transform matrix recursively with the Hadamard matrix. Thus we could exploit the repetitive property of the elements in the orthogonal matrix to enlarge the Euclidean distances among the signals. Moreover, the value of the elements could be adjusted dynamically to adapt to time-changing channel conditions. Thanks to the orthogonality of the matrix, and the singular value decomposition (SVD), the interferences among signals could be effectively suppressed. Accordingly, the reliability performances can be improved. Furthermore, we derive the theoretical symbol error rate (SER) expressions for the proposed design. Numerical simulations are performed to validate the theoretical analysis. Furthermore, the SER performances with different water types, and wind speeds in various scenarios of the atmosphere, underwater, and air-water interface channels are investigated, and compared with the counterpart systems.","telecommunication network reliability,multiple input multiple output transmission scheme,underwater environment,Reliability engineering,user information,transmission reliability performances,Visible light communication,maritime visible light communication systems,matrix algebra,singular value decomposition,variant marine channel conditions,reliability,multiple input multiple output,Matrix decomposition,turbulence influence,free-space optical communication,Scattering,orthogonal transform aided MIMO design,Reliability theory,error statistics,Euclidean distances,orthogonal transform matrix,maritime visible light communication,wireless channels,symbol error rate expressions,reliable maritime visible light communications,SER performances,Hadamard matrix,marine communication,complex marine channel conditions,orthogonal transform,Air and underwater channels,MIMO communication,Transforms,air-water interface channels,"
"a single-carrier delay-and-superposition based high spectral efficiency differential chaos shift keying for maritime internet of vessels","2022","The fast growing Internet of Vessels (IoV) requires maritime communications to be more spectral efficient to make full use of the scarce maritime spectral resource, provide a high data transmission rate and support massive communication nodes to access the network. However, the spectral efficiency of most existing maritime communications are still relatively low, and consequently maritime communications can hardly support high volume multi-user communications. Therefore, in this paper, a high spectral efficiency Differential Chaos Shift Keying system based on a single-carrier delay-and-superposition modulation technology (SCDS-DCSK) is proposed for IoV scenarios. In a SCDS-DCSK symbol, all sub-carriers have the same frequency, indicating that the symbol of SCDS-DCSK only occupies the bandwidth of a single sub-channel. As a result, a large amount of maritime communication resources can be saved for accommodating more communication nodes and the spectral efficiency is significantly improved. System architectures and principles are firstly demonstrated. Then, the spectral efficiency, peak mean power ratio (PAPR), complexity, and the origin of error bits of SCDS-DCSK are analyzed, and the bit-error-rate expressions are derived. Moreover, effects of various system parameters and levels of sea states on the system performance are simulated and discussed. Simulation results verify the theoretical analyses, and manifest that the SCDS-DCSK can achieve a high spectral efficiency under various sea states. Thanks to characteristics such as high spectral efficiency, flexible parameter configuration, and simple implementation, SCDS-DCSK is a promising technology for improving the quality of service (QoS) of future maritime IoV.","single-carrier delay-and-superposition,peak mean power ratio,QoS,quality of service,SCDS-DCSK symbol,PAPR,modulation,future maritime IoV,Vessels,chaos,maritime communication resources,error statistics,Maritime communications,spectral efficiency,single subchannel,single carrier delay,Modulation,superposition modulation technology,Sea state,fast growing Internet,support massive communication nodes,chaotic communication,consequently maritime communications,Frequency modulation,high data transmission rate,Symbols,high volume multiuser communications,Chaotic communication,marine communication,maritime Internet of Vessels,Spectral efficiency,Internet of Vessels (IoV),Internet,scarce maritime spectral resource,high spectral efficiency differential chaos shift keying system,maritime communications,"
"multi-use hf radar for arctic maritime domain awareness","2013","With the increased interest and presence that the U.S. Coast Guard has in the Arctic [1] there is also a rising need for increased Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) from autonomous sensors in this area. From June through November 2012, University of Alaska, Fairbanks (UAF) deployed and maintained three Long Range SeaSonde@ HF Surface Wave Radars operating in the 5 MHz band and two High Resolution SeaSondes operating in the 25 MHz band to map hourly ocean surface currents in the Chukchi Sea during the summer and fall. With funding from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) National Center for Islands, Maritime, and Extreme Environments Security (CIMES), UAF partnered with Rutgers University, a partner in the DHS Center for Secure and Resilient Maritime Commerce (CSR) and CODAR Ocean Sensors to demonstrate multi-use MDA capability of SeaSondes to provide vessel detections simultaneously with surface current maps near Barrow, Alaska. The Arctic region poses challenges to HF Radar vessel detection including: remote locations requiring specialized shelter, power and communications; extreme weather; the presence of ice floes, which have their own Doppler echoes in addition to sea clutter; and a different radio environment with auroral influences. Vessel detection results are shown with corresponding AIS data, the effect of diurnal ionosphere activity on HF Doppler spectra is shown and the performance of the UAF remote power module (RPM) is discussed.","surface current maps,marine radar,remote sensing,extreme weather,autonomous sensors,high frequency radar,radar detection,HF surface wave radars,maritime domain awareness,UAF remote power module,high resolution SeaSondes,vessel detections,Sea measurements,sea clutter,Noise measurement,HF Doppler spectra,Noise,multiuse HF radar,Oceans,multiuse MDA capability,Floors,vessel detection,diurnal ionosphere activity,arctic maritime domain awareness,CODAR ocean sensors,Doppler echoes,ocean surface currents,HF radar vessel detection,radio environment,ocean currents,Radar detection,"
"insights and guidance for offshore co2 storage monitoring based on the qics, eti mmv, and stemm-ccs projects","2020","Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is a collective term for technologies that allow society to unlock the benefits of energy intensive processes like fertiliser production and combustion of fuels (fossil or biologically sourced) without releasing the CO2 to the atmosphere. Hence, CCS could assist in accelerating decarbonisation while society pursues a just energy transition. This paper aims to summarise the learnings of three research projects that all investigated aspects of marine monitoring for CCS from a CO2 storage operator’s perspective. The QICS (Quantifying and Monitoring Potential Ecosystem Impacts of Geological Carbon Storage), ETI MMV (Energy Technologies Institute Measurement, Monitoring and Verification of CO2 Storage), and STEMM-CCS (Strategies for Environmental Monitoring of Marine CCS) projects collectively represent over twelve years of dedicated research to assess environmental impacts and to develop technologies for detection, location, and quantification of potential leakage from offshore geological storage of CO2. Each project used controlled releases in representative environments to test their methods and technologies. QICS as the first of the three projects, focused on the understanding of sensitivities of the UK marine environment to a potential leak from a CO2 storage complex and tested technologies to detect such emissions. The ETI MMV project brought together research and industry partners to develop and sea trial an operational, integrated and cost-effective marine monitoring system for geological CO2 storage. As a commercial project, these results have never been published before and this paper shares for the first-time insights from this work. In February 2020, STEMM-CCS, completed its quest to test techniques for environmental monitoring over a marine CO2 storage site in the UK North Sea, further improved near seabed leakage characterisation capabilities, and delivered a first marine CCS demonstration level ecological baseline. This paper aims to summarise some of the key insights from the three projects and provides references where available for the interested reader. The key finding of all three projects is that the impacts of small to medium CO2 leakages from large-scale storage are limited and localised. Technology capabilities exist for integrated marine CO2 storage monitoring and their performance has been benchmarked at controlled release trials. Even small leakages of 10−50 L/min can be detected at unknown locations in a large area of interest. Finally, the first important steps towards automated monitoring data analysis have been made, including automated leakage signal detection from Side Scan Sonar data (ETI MMV project) and automated species identification from marine biology images (STEMM-CCS project). Some remaining challenges include missed/false alerts because of large variations in the background signal, the cost of monitoring large areas over long periods, and making real-time decisions based on big data. Continued work to reduce the cost of marine monitoring technologies and advancing automation of data processing and analysis will be important in order to support safe and efficient offshore CCS deployment at large scale.","CCS,Location,Offshore CO2 storage,Regulation,Impact assessment,Quantification,Monitoring,Verification,Detection,Attribution,"
"low-cost, intelligent drifter fleet for large-scale, distributed ocean observation","2022","We have developed Persistent Environmental Awareness Reporting and Location (PEARL) ocean drifters. PEARL drifters are small, rugged, low-cost, autonomous, environmentally friendly ocean drifters that represent a significant opportunity for high-impact applications in both national security and environmental ecosystem monitoring. Drifters record and report data which is processed by advanced edge analytics before being compressed for satellite transmission to populate a large data repository with sensor data that is combined and analyzed to discover signals of interest in the ocean environment with the goal of increasing distributed maritime awareness. Each drifter is entirely self-contained, powered by solar panels and backup batteries, with a large array of sensors, compute module for onboard data processing, and satellite modem for data reporting. The drifter architecture is flexible and can be customized for a specific purpose. The complete data record is stored locally and processed by the onboard compute module, which runs anomaly detection algorithms that detect nearby activity. Anomalous events, as well as baseline environmental data, are reported to a cloud database using satellite short burst data transmission. Though each independent drifter is a powerful sensing tool, the low unit cost permits large scale deployment.

"the declining impact of piracy on maritime transport in the indian ocean: statistical analysis of 5-year vessel tracking data","2015","The analysis of the declining impact of piracy on maritime routes and vessel behaviours in the Indian Ocean is here performed using Long Range Identification and Tracking (LRIT) reports. A 5-year archive of vessel position data covering the period characterized by the highest number of attacks and the subsequent decline provides a unique source for data-driven statistical analysis that highlights changes in routing and sailing speeds. The work, besides demonstrating the value of LRIT data for statistical maritime traffic analysis, can be used to ultimately provide quantitative support to the estimates of the additional fuel consumption due to piracy.

"exploring ais data for intelligent maritime routes extraction","2020","Maritime traffic route is the basis for the analysis of ship traffic characteristics and navigation safety. However, the spatial freedom of ship navigation makes the extraction of maritime traffic route a challenging task. In order to realize the extraction of ship traffic routes at sea, a maritime route extraction method based on ship history automatic identification system (AIS) data is proposed. In this method, the ship trajectory with rich position information is transformed into a ship trip semantic object (STSO) with semantic information, and each ship trip is abstracted as a “stop-waypoint-stop” trip object. In addition, based on the graph theory, the STSO is further integrated into the nodes and edges of a directed maritime traffic graph to realize the extraction and expression of the shipping routes. In order to prove the effectiveness of this method, the real-world AIS historical data are used for testing, and the results show that this method can effectively extract maritime traffic routes.","Automatic Identification System (AIS),Semantic trajectory,Shipping route,Maritime traffic,Graph theory,"
"time series analyses of tree ring chronologies from pacific north america: evidence for sub-century climate oscillations","1999","Tree ring-width chronologies from the west coast of North America were obtained from on-line data archives, maintained by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Data covered the period 1650–1983, for trees sampled at 43 sites between Dawson Creek, British Columbia (55°N) and Yosemite Park, CA (37°N). These time series were analyzed using Fourier transformation methods. Spyglass Transform software allowed the resulting power spectra to be stacked and compared, based on characteristics such as topography and continentality, latitude and species ecological niche. Results suggested that several regular or quasi-regular cycles are occurring over various time periods. There are some similarities, though not an exact match, with El Niño periodicities noted by earlier authors. These patterns appear to be widespread, affecting trees at various elevations and distances from the coast, and from different species. A separate analysis of the oldest trees revealed sub-century cycles. In particular, the longer fluctuations at 50–65 years are consistent with recent findings on north Pacific climate by other authors. A Euclidean cluster analysis of individual years identified unusual year groupings between 1924–1946, a period associated with positive temperature anomalies and generally higher precipitation. These findings appear to be consistent with other basin-scale climate cycles, like the Southern Oscillation, and the recently-proposed Pacific Interdecadal Oscillation (PDO).","Power spectra,El Niño,Pacific basin,Dendrochronology,Tree rings,Pacific Interdecadal Oscillation,Climate oscillations,"

"automatic fault detection in seismic data using gaussian process regression","2019","Compartmentalization of hydrocarbon reservoirs, change in fluid contacts, effects of high permeable fractures around faults, and hydrocarbon traps created by seal faults make fault detection and extraction as a necessity in the analysis of seismic data. Faulting disrupts the smoothness trend of geological layers (reflections in seismic sections) and displaces layers along its plane. Thus, a fault could be considered as an abnormal phenomenon that globally deviates normal behavior of layers around its plane. In the present study, faults are considered as sparse global anomalies in a seismic section that can be extracted using Gaussian process regression. The Gaussian process regression is a nonparametric probabilistic model based on Bayesian statistics that can be used to model spatial properties as a regression problem. The Gaussian process usually is used to extract and describe normal interactions from the data set using smooth functions. The main idea of this study is to detect the global anomaly using Gaussian process regression. For this purpose, we considered geological layers as smooth normal events in seismic sections. Therefore, the location of the fault plane is where the Gaussian process gets an error during describing the layers. Abnormalities such as faults cause the Gaussian process to suffer an error near the anomaly. We used these errors and analyzed them to detect probable locations of fault edge. Finally, we used a consistent connection algorithm to separate most probable fault points and to connect them to an edge using morphological reconstruction algorithm. The proposed algorithm was evaluated based on the receiver operating characteristics analysis. Several synthetic seismic sections with different levels of signal to noise ratios were used to evaluate the algorithm in the presence of random noise. The results showed that all points predicted by a diagnostic test fell into the area above the diagonal of the receiver operating characteristics space, which represents a good diagnostic classification.","Global anomaly detection,Gaussian process regression,Fault,Reconstruction morphology,"
"athlete target detection method in dynamic scenario based on nonlinear filtering and yolov5","2023","In this paper firefly optimization algorithm is improved, including the method of relative firefly fluorescence brightness, the method of attraction and the method of firefly position update. The dynamic step size factor and dynamic difference factor are introduced, and the improved firefly algorithm is used to optimize the particle filter, so that the particle swarm can be concentrated to the high likelihood region as much as possible, so as to ensure the overall quality of the particle swarm. In this paper, the most commonly used non-maximum suppression algorithm in the post-processing stage of target detection model is discussed.

"the aleutian low, storm tracks, and winter climate variability in the bering sea","2007","Previous studies have found inconsistent results regarding how wintertime conditions in the Bering Sea relate to variations in the North Pacific climate system. This problem is addressed through analysis of data from the NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis for the period 1950–2003. Composite patterns of sea-level pressure, 500hPa geopotential heights, storm tracks and surface air temperature are presented for four situations: periods of strong Aleutian Low, weak Aleutian Low, warm Bering Sea air temperatures, and cold Bering Sea air temperatures. Winter temperatures in the Bering Sea are only marginally related to the strength of the Aleutian Low, and are much more sensitive to the position of the Aleutian Low and to variations in storm tracks. In particular, relatively warm temperatures are associated with either an enhanced storm track off the coast of Siberia, and hence anomalous southerly low-level flow, or an enhanced storm track entering the eastern Bering Sea from the southeast. These latter storms do not systematically affect the mean meridional winds, but rather serve to transport mild air of maritime origin over the Bering Sea. The leading indices for the North Pacific, such as the NP and PNA, are more representative of the patterns of tropospheric circulation and storm track anomalies associated with the strength of the Aleutian Low than patterns associated with warm and cold wintertime conditions in the Bering Sea.","Aleutian Low,Winds,Storm tracks,North Pacific,Bering Sea,Climate variability,"
"a bernoulli track-before-detect filter for interacting targets in maritime radar","2021","This article is devoted to the problem of multitarget tracking in the maritime environment using Bernoulli track-before-detect (TBD) filtering. Detection and tracking of weak targets in sea clutter using high-resolution airborne radar is notoriously challenging compared to classical target tracking problems. Furthermore, the measured amplitude in range-azimuth cells that are in the vicinity of closely spaced (interacting) targets represents a superposition of individual target contributions, demanding a special joint treatment. This article proposes a novel solution for multitarget tracking using Bernoulli TBD for maritime radar and covers cases when targets are both far apart and closely spaced.

"geochemical and stable isotopic variability within two rivers rising under the same mountain, but belonging to two distant watersheds","2013","Complementary geochemical and stable isotope investigations of the Gorski Kotar karst aquifer system in western Croatia were obtained for the first time, to answer the question whether both studied rivers drain the same aquifer system or not. The two main rivers, the Kupa and the Rječina, rise under the same mountain range, but belong to two different watersheds (Black Sea and Adriatic Sea). The karst aquifer of Gorski Kotar is a potentially important source of drinking water for two neighboring countries, Croatia and Slovenia (Central and South Europe), and is strongly influenced by both Mediterranean and continental weather conditions. It is a part of the Dinaric karst, which is “locus typicus” for karst worldwide and one of the most typical karst areas in the world. To answer the main question of our research, baseline data were thoroughly collected comprising stable isotopes, concentration of dissolved and total trace metals in water, and multi-elemental analyses of river sediments, together with other physical-chemical parameters (pH, dissolved oxygen, electric conductivity and temperature). Total dissolved solid (TDS) was not measured but estimated as (EC) 0.67. Such multi-technique approach was applied for the first time in the Dinaric karst systems. Multi-elemental analysis of fine sediment fraction (<63μm) of eight samples was performed by ICP-MS. Elemental composition of sediments is quite different in the two studied river valleys, which indicates different origin of their waters. Also, concentrations of selected metals were compared with existing sediment quality criteria and anthropogenic influence is evaluated and discussed. Analytical results of major ions determined in three springs (Kupa spring, Rječina spring, Zvir spring in the City of Rijeka) were used to construct a Piper diagram, which showed that they are of a Ca–Na–HCO3–Cl type. The highest concentration of Mg is present in the Kupa spring, while the highest concentrations of Na and Cl are present in the Zvir spring. Groundwaters are underlain by limestone, less by dolomite and are under a maritime influence. There is a big difference with the main groundwater types reported in North Africa, i.e. in the south Mediterranean Sea, where two main groundwater types are Na–Cl and Ca–SO4–Cl. Concentrations of total and dissolved fractions of trace metals in surface water samples were determined by voltammetry and compared to the European Water Framework Directive values. Concentrations of total Pb and Zn are significantly higher in the water of the Kupa spring than the Rječina spring, suggesting that the karst water bodies of the two springs are not of the same origin. In addition, stable isotope composition (deuterium and oxygen-18) was determined in the spring waters sampled during low and high water conditions. Due to the significant difference in oxygen isotope-ratios it was concluded that the karst reservoir for the Kupa and Rječina springs is not identical. The results obtained from the combination of physical–chemical, geochemical (water and sediment) and isotope multi-technique analyses pointed out that even though the springs of the Kupa and Rječina rivers originate from the same mountain range, they do not drain the same karst aquifer.","Risnjak National Park,Kupa and Rječina rivers (Croatia),Stable isotopes (deuterium and oxygen-18),Water quality,Transboundary karst aquifer,Perhumid climate,Sediment and water chemistry,Physical–chemical parameters,"
"satellite machine-type communication for maritime internet of things: an interference perspective","2019","Satellite machine-type communication plays a crucial role in the maritime Internet of Things. The realization of such a system, i.e., the VHF data exchange (VDES) satellite system, however, faces many technical challenges. Due to its global broadcasting nature, the interference generated from the emissions of the VDES satellite space stations to the incumbent or future land systems in the same band is of major concern to the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) spectrum allocation. However, neither regulatory rules nor related studies have been specified or made available in the literature regarding such interference. This paper utilizes the electromagnetic power flux density (PFD) mask concept for evaluating and constraining the emission onto earth from a satellite space station. The mathematical analysis and derivation are based on the principle that the actual interference from a space station that a land system experiences is no worse than that from any other land system allowed by the regulations. We demonstrate the derivation of such a PFD mask from three closely related regulations on the legacy land mobile systems by the Electronic Communications Committee (ECC) and ITU and present the corresponding constraints imposed on the VDES satellite system and their impacts on the performance of the system.","VDES satellite space station system,interference perspective,satellite machine-type communication,maritime machine-type communication,VHF data exchange satellite system,Internet of Things,Marine vehicles,satellite communication,electromagnetic PFD mask concept,Space stations,ITU,Electronic Communications Committee,e-navigation,electronic data interchange,Maritime Internet of Things,Artificial intelligence,space communication links,maritime Internet of Things,radiofrequency interference,ITU spectrum allocation,electromagnetic power flux density mask concept,Satellite broadcasting,ECC,mathematical analysis,land system experiences,land mobile systems,Interference,International Telecommunication Union spectrum allocation,"

"fault diagnosis for induction generator-based wind turbine using ensemble deep learning techniques","2022","Fault diagnosis in induction machines (IM) require effective detection at early stages to prevent permanent machine failure. This requires fast sensing of disturbances as well as efficient diagnosis methods. Conventional signal measuring techniques are usually intrusive, sensitive, with a low signal-to-noise ratio, and may show limited performance at incipient fault stages. Moreover, traditional machine learning (ML) diagnosis techniques based on handcrafted feature extraction methods suffer from limitations that can be overcome by deep learning (DL) with automatic feature extraction capabilities. In this paper, an online, non-intrusive method is proposed for fault diagnosis in a three-phase IM based on infrared imaging. The proposed method integrates three convolutional neural network (CNN)-based DL models (Inception, Xception, and MobileNet) to identify IM health status, fault types, and stator Inter-turn faults (ITF) location and severity. Deep features obtained from these CNNs are merged through Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) resulting in spatial-time-frequency features. This fusion reduces the input features’ size and improves diagnostic accuracy. Merged features’ length is further reduced using the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) where these reduced features are then used for classification. Compared to DL-based diagnosis methods introduced in previous work, the proposed method shows superior performance. First, it uses the IR images directly without the need for clustering and segmentation steps, thus saving time and effort. Moreover, ensembled DL is applied via combining the three CNNs benefits altogether rather than applying an individual DL method. Finally, unlike the huge features’ number exhibited by previous studies, the proposed approach uses minimal features, thus reducing classification complexity and time while maintaining 100% classification accuracy.","Renewable energy generating,Wind energy​ sources,Ensemble deep learning,Classification,Infrared thermal imaging,Fault diagnosis,Wind turbine inter-turn faults,Condition monitoring,"
"intelligent anomaly detection of trajectories for iot empowered maritime transportation systems","2023","The convergence of Maritime Transportation Systems (MTS) and Internet of Things (IoT) has led to the promising IoT-empowered MTS (IoT-MTS). However, abnormal trajectories of maritime transportation ships can have highly negative impacts on the management of IoT-MTS. Therefore, anomaly detection of trajectories is important for the successful deployment of IoT-MTS. In this paper, we propose a Transfer Learning based Trajectory Anomaly Detection strategy, named TLTAD, for IoT-MTS. Specifically, a variational autoencoder is used to discover the potential connections between each dimension of the normal trajectory, while a graph variational autoencoder is used to explore the spatial similarity between normal trajectories. Based on internal connection of trajectories, a deep reinforcement learning algorithm, Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic policy gradient (TD3), is employed to train the trajectory anomaly detection model. To reduce the model training time, transfer learning is used to migrate the trained anomaly detection model between different regions of an ocean area or between similar ocean areas. Moreover, an efficient data transformation module is designed to improve the efficiency of model transfer. The experiments were conducted on a real-world automatic identification system (AIS) dataset. The results indicate that the proposed TLTAD can provide accurate anomaly detection on shipsâ€™ trajectories in IoT-MTS with reduced model training times.","reduced model training times,Transportation,deep learning (artificial intelligence),Anomaly detection,maritime transportation systems,anomaly detection,Internet of Things,transportation,Marine vehicles,abnormal trajectories,Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic policy gradient,highly negative impacts,model training time,ships,IoT-MTS,trajectory anomaly detection model,deep reinforcement learning algorithm,Data models,normal trajectory,reinforcement learning,maritime transportation ships,Artificial intelligence,real-world automatic identification system dataset,Maritime Transportation Systems,graph variational autoencoder,trained anomaly detection model,Trajectory Anomaly Detection strategy,gradient methods,Deep reinforcement learning,model transfer,Trajectory,promising IoT-empowered MTS,intelligent Anomaly Detection,transfer learning,learning (artificial intelligence),data handling,Analytical models,"
"characterization of a transmitter in a medium frequency maritime terrestrial navigation system","2019","Due to the worldwide recognition of increased jamming and spoofing events, which threaten the usability of global navigation satellite systems (GNSS), positioning systems using signals of opportunity are gaining importance as backup systems. Especially for maritime usage, a terrestrial system called Ranging-Mode (R-Mode) is under development. Among other signals, it utilizes the maritime medium frequency broadcasts of the differential GNSS (DGNSS) service. Currently, the estimation of phase in a time continuous medium frequency signal is used to determine the distance between transmitter and receiver. Here, the delay of a transmitter on the signal phase is of great interest, since it directly affects the performance of the R-Mode system. In this paper, the influence of a medium frequency power amplifier is characterized as part of the transmitter chain. The aim is to give the operators of DGNSS stations the possibility to characterize their station themselves when the R-Mode system is operational. Therefore, widely used measuring instruments are utilized, rather than using well-known cost-intensive techniques like phase delay measurements. A simple setup with different evaluation methods that fit this requirement is presented. Furthermore, it is capable of measuring the absolute time delay. The presented workflow was tested on an amplifier with output power of 100 W at the transmitter station near Koblenz, Germany.","R-Mode,terrestrial system,Delays,marine navigation,transmitter delay measurement,power amplifiers,phase delay measurements,Transmitters,DGNSS stations,jamming,global navigation satellite systems,synchronisation,Delay effects,satellite navigation,R-Mode system,transmitter chain,medium frequency power amplifier,power 100.0 W,time continuous medium frequency signal,medium frequency maritime terrestrial navigation system,signal phase,Ranging-Mode,backup systems,Time-frequency analysis,Oscilloscopes,spoofing events,differential GNSS service,maritime medium frequency broadcasts,transmitter station,radio transmitters,terrestrial navigation system,"
"passive microwave remote and in situ measurements of artic and subarctic snow covers in alaska","1991","Between 11 and 19 March 1988, airborne and satellite passive microwave measurements were acquired simultaneously with ground measurements of depth, density and stratigraphy of the snow in central and northern Alaska. Five aircraft flights were flown along a north-south transect between about 147 ° W and 152 ° W, and extending from about 63° N (south of Fairbanks, Alaska) to the Arctic Ocean coastline, with an Aircraft Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (AMMR) on-board operating at 92 GHz, 37 GHz, 21 GHz, and 18 GHz. Passive microwave data from the satellite-borne Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSMI), operating at 85.5 GHz, 37 GHz, 21 GHz, 18 GHz, and 10 GHz, were obtained concurrently. A good correspondence in brightness temperature (TB) trends between the aircraft and satellite data was found. However, an expected inverse correlation between depth hoar thickness and TB was not found to be strong. A persistent TB minimum in both the aircraft and the satellite data was detected along the northern foothills of the Brooks Range. In an area located at about 68° 50'N, 149° 20'W, the TB as recorded from the aircraft microwave sensor dropped by 55 K. Satellite microwave measurements showed a TB decrease of up to 45 K at approximately the same location. Snow pit measurements did not reveal notable differences in snow characteristics or depth in this location. An examination of passive microwave satellite data from 1978 to 1987 revealed that similar low latewinter TB values were found in approximately the same locations as those observed in March 1988. According to the satellite data, the zone of low TB develops as the snow deepens, and reaches the lowest values in March or April each year. The cause of this TB minimum is unknown but thought to be related to snow stratigraphy. The observed difficulty in relating the ground measurements to data collected using aircraft and satellite passive microwave sensors is attributed to the fact that the snow depth and character are highly variable in central and northern Alaska. This variability is exemplified in the field measurements as well as in the passive microwave measurements.",""
"assessment of the possibility of using a waterway for operation of autonomous ships","2023","The development of autonomous navigation is an important element in terms of increasing the efficiency of the water transport system, and the current level of technology and technology allows building ships that will operate without a crew or with remote control. The performed literary analysis of scientific sources of information confirms the significant lack of research aimed at the development of waterway infrastructure for unmanned ships. The study described in this paper is aimed at developing a design criterion that determines the possibility of using the waterway for the operation of autonomous ships. Data on the movement and density of ships for the waters of the Gulf of Finland according to the data of Automatic Identification System are presented. The analysis of vessel density in this work was carried out using the DBSCAN mathematical algorithm. It is proposed to use the concept and term 'knowledgeable' to include sections of the waterway in the zone of autonomous navigation. The involved experts assessed five criteria in terms of their significance: the availability of data on navigation on the selected section of the waterway, the availability of electronic navigation charts, the availability of hydrometeorological information, the availability of technical means of communication and navigational fencing. As a continuation of the research, it is proposed to study many qualitative and quantitative characteristics of both the area of the water area and the specialized equipment installed on it, since the operation of autonomous ships requires a more complex technical and information infrastructure.","knowledge of the water area,vessel traffic monitoring,DBSCAN,Autonomous navigation,maritime waterways,ships position clustering,automatic identification system,water transport system,expert system,"
"meteotsunamis at the río de la plata estuary","2022","A recent numerical study showed that low-amplitude meteotsunamis could be detected at the Río de la Plata (RDP) estuary. In this work, eight sea level series (one year long, 2018) were analyzed: six measured within the RDP estuary and two at the adjacent continental shelf. All meteotsunami events during 2018 were identified and analyzed at the RDP estuary, and the maximum wave height observed was 0.78 m. The atmospheric conditions during the analyzed events were investigated, showing that the presence of atmospheric cold fronts and atmospheric gravity waves seem to happen simultaneously with meteotsunami events. From sea-level observations gathered at the estuary it was inferred that the meteotsunamis could be driven by atmospheric forcings propagating (i) mainly from SE to NW (the meteotsunami would be driven along the estuary from the outer to the upper RDP, and the Proudman resonance mechanism could explain its amplification), (ii) predominantly from SW to NE (the meteotsunami would be simultaneously generated at different locations of the RDP estuary), or (iii) the meteotsunami could be generated in waters of the continental shelf, to get into the RDP estuary, and then freely propagates from the outer to the upper RDP (in this case the Proudman resonance mechanism would not explain the amplification within the estuary). It is important to mention that the results of the present investigation are biased to the high-period band of meteotsunamis because the sampling interval (20 min, for most locations) is rather large to allow the study of the whole meteotsunami frequency band.","Río de la Plata (RPD) estuary,Proudman resonance,Meteorological tsunami,Atmospheric cold fronts,Atmospheric gravity waves,"
"long-term observation of global nuclear power plants thermal plumes using landsat images and deep learning","2023","Thermal discharge from nuclear power plants poses a threat to the received natural water bodies, but the long-term extent and intensity of their surface thermal plumes remain unclear. In this study, we proposed a method to determine the background area for each drainage outlet and delineate the mixed surface thermal plumes based on 7,172 Landsat thermal infrared images. We further used a deep convolutional neural network integrated with prior location knowledge to extract core surface thermal plumes for 74 drainage outlets of 66 nuclear power plants worldwide. Our final model achieved a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 0.8998 and an F1 score of 0.8886. We found that the mean maximal water surface temperature (WST) increment of the studied plants globally was 4.80 K. The Tianwan plant in China experienced the highest WST increase (8.51 K), followed by the Gravelines plant in France and the Ohi plant in Japan (7.91 K and 7.71 K, respectively). The Bruce plant in Canada had the largest thermal-polluted surface area (7.22 km2). We also provided the dataset, Global Coastal Nuclear power plant Thermal Plume (GCNT-Plume), to describe the long-term occurrence of water surface thermal plumes. Three influencing factors of the water surface thermal plume were further analyzed in this study, including total capacity, drainage type, and location type, which were associated with operating power, drainage method, and geographical features, respectively. Total capacity was more statistically related to the maximum of WST increment under shallow drainage condition. The mean WST increment of shallow drainage was 1.22 K higher than that of deep drainage. Surface plumes larger than 4 km2 frequently occurred in the Great Lakes, while small surface thermal plumes (< 1 km2) were primarily found in estuaries. The proposed method provides an important framework for future operational water surface thermal plume detection using remotely sensed observations and deep learning.","Landsat,WST,Surface thermal plume,Deep learning,Thermal infrared remote sensing,Nuclear power plants,"
"identifying industrial heat sources using time-series of the viirs nightfire product with an object-oriented approach","2018","Carbon-based fuels burned at industrial facilities account for a large proportion of greenhouse gas emissions, and an up-to-date spatiotemporally detailed inventory is essential for a better understanding of global carbon emission patterns. The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Nightfire product offers a quantitative estimation of the temperatures of sub-pixel heat sources, providing the potential for detecting thermal anomalies from industrial sectors across the globe. However, identifying subcategories of various industrial heat sources is challenging because there are scarcely any stable and typical characteristics for their classification at a single thermal anomaly scale. Specifically, these nighttime thermal anomalies exhibit a strong spatiotemporal heterogeneity (e.g., fluctuations in retrieved temperature, spatial shifts in position, and presence of false positives), even in industrial heat sources that do not vary through time. Here, we demonstrate an object-oriented approach to robustly segment and accurately classify various industrial heat sources from a time-series of the VIIRS Nightfire product. The approach operates from the cluster level of spatially adjacent nighttime thermal anomalies (i.e., nighttime-heat-source objects rather than individual thermal anomalies) to generate fingerprint-like characteristics and to address the challenge of spatiotemporal heterogeneity. Specifically, the spatial-aggregation characteristic of nighttime thermal anomalies from continuously operating industrial heat sources and the temporal-aggregation characteristics of biomass burnings were incorporated to differentiate industrial nighttime-heat-source objects from ubiquitous biomass burnings. Subsequently, the similarity of the thermal signals of nighttime thermal anomalies from identical industrial heat sources was used to generate highly recognizable characteristics for their identification. A spatiotemporally detailed inventory of industrial heat sources across the globe was then established from this object-oriented classification. The inventory included a total of 15,199 industrial heat sources, representing 49.52% of all higher confidence nighttime thermal anomalies in the VIIRS Nightfire product. Validation of the results showed that only 218 objects (1.43%) were biomass burnings or active volcanoes that were misclassified as industrial heat sources. Further validation of sub-categories indicated an overall classification accuracy of ~77%. Our findings suggest that the VIIRS Nightfire product has great potential for monitoring the global distribution and dynamics of industrial heat sources, and combined with the object-oriented approach developed here the methodology is simple, robust, and cost-effective.","Nightfire product,Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS),Object-oriented analysis,Identification,Industrial heat sources,Time-series,"
"improbability mapping: a metric for satellite-detection of submarine volcanic eruptions","2014","Submarine volcanic eruptions can result in both real and apparent changes in marine algal communities, e.g., increases in phytoplankton biomass and/or growth rates that can cover thousands of square kilometers. Satellite ocean color monitoring detects these changes as increases in chlorophyll and particulate backscattering. Detailed, high resolution analysis is needed to separate the optical effects of volcanic products from the response of the marine algal community. It is possible to calculate an index, which maps the magnitude of improbable change (relative to long term average conditions) following known volcanic eruptions by using low resolution, initial estimates of chlorophyll and backscatter along with an archived history of satellite data. We apply multivariate probability analysis to changes in global satellite ocean chlorophyll and particulate backscatter data to create a new metric for observing apparent biological responses to submarine eruptions. Several examples are shown, illustrating the sensitivity of our improbability mapping index to known submarine volcanic events, yielding a potentially robust method for the detection of new events in remote locations.","Improbability mapping index,Satellite detection,Submarine volcanic eruptions,"
"maritime moving target long time integration for gnss-based passive bistatic radar","2018","This paper addresses the exploitation of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) as transmitters of opportunity in passive bistatic radar systems for maritime surveillance. The main limitation of this technology is the restricted power budget provided by navigation satellites, which makes it necessary to define innovative moving target detection techniques specifically tailored for the system under consideration. To this aim, this paper puts forward long integration time techniques able to collect the signal energy over long time intervals (tens of seconds), allowing the retrieval of suitable levels of signal-to-disturbance ratios for detection purposes. A local plane based technique is first considered, providing target detection in a plane that represents the section of maritime area covered by the radar antenna. As a suboptimum solution in terms of achievable integration gain, but more efficient from a computational point of view, a second technique is considered working in the conventional bistatic range and Doppler plane (basic plane based). Results against synthetic and experimental datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.","moving target detection,GNSS-based passive bistatic radar,navigation satellites,forward long integration time techniques,radar detection,passive radar,radar antennas,Transmitters,Doppler plane,signal-to-disturbance ratios,Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) based passive radar,target tracking,passive bistatic radar (PBR),local plane based technique,maritime moving target long time integration,satellite navigation,maritime surveillance,object detection,radar antenna,Global Navigation Satellite Systems,innovative moving target detection,restricted power budget,Doppler radar,Passive radar,marine communication,Receivers,Surveillance,Spaceborne radar,Global navigation satellite system,"
"a task allocation scheme generation method for maritime oil spill emergency monitoring based on bilateral matching","2022","Aiming at the task allocation problem of maritime oil spill emergency monitoring, the bilateral matching theory is applied to standardize the task allocation process and improve the emergency effectiveness. First of all, the task of maritime oil spill emergency monitoring and the monitoring subjects carrying out the tasks are identified, and the specific types, difficulties and risks of the tasks are identified. Then, the task type is introduced to indirectly express the relationship between â€˜monitoring subject-taskâ€™. On this basis, two concepts of task demand satisfaction and emergency monitoring subject capability competency are proposed to express the preference information of bilateral subjects. And then on the basis of redefining the specific connotation of the basic concept of bilateral matching theory under the background of maritime oil spill emergency monitoring task allocation, a bilateral matching model for task allocation of maritime oil spill emergency monitoring considering attribute priority is constructed. Finally, according to the specific characteristics of the model, a fast generation algorithm of feasible solution is designed to solve the problem.

"interception of chemicals at a forest edge for a rural low-lying site at black wood, hampshire, southern england","1994","Precipitation (rainfall and snowfall), throughfall, stemflow and net-precipitation (throughfall and stemflow) chemistry data are presented for a block-network of collectors located in a beech plantation in a rural area of southern England. The precipitation shows a variable chemistry linked to the relative supplies of material derived from maritime, pollutant and lithogenic sources. Inputs of solutes are spatially variable for those components associated with pollutant sources indicating local and variable sources for these constituents. Gaseous concentrations of SOx, NOx and NH3 all average ∼ 8 ppb outside the forest: within the forest, lower concentrations were observed. The precipitation — throughfall — stemflow results indicate that the trees capture occult deposition (i.e. non-precipitation detected atmospheric supplies of materials, e.g. from fine-droplets/mist, gases and particulate matter), thereby enriching the composition of stemflow and throughfall. Concentrations and fluxes of most solutes are increased by between 50 and 100%: only strontium, barium and hydrogen ions show a depletion. At the forest edge, there is an even greater difference between the precipitation and net-precipitation, especially for the sea-salts: the trees at the forest edge are particularly efficient at scavenging the occult materials. There are differences in chemical fluxes for the blocks that are not simply confined to an edge-interior division: this is most marked for manganese where cycling through the vegetation is dominant and the various locations respond in different ways. Despite storm damage there is little sign of a change in the chemical fluxes to the catchment: the loss of canopy is probably compensated for by an increased roughness that, in turn, results in increased turbulence, higher interception loss and greater scavenging.","Rainfall,Throughfall,Forest,Beech,Chemical,Interception,Stemflow,"
"chemical composition and provenance of chinese porcelain shards recovered from old goa, west coast of india","2017","During recent archaeological explorations at Old Goa, west coast of India, twenty three Chinese porcelain shards of the Ming (Middle to late 16th century), Qing (17th century) and late Qing period (late 17th century) have been recovered. In order to understand the nature and source of raw material and kilns, these shards were analysed for major elements with X-ray fluorescence (XRF), trace and rare earth elements by Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS). The analysis suggests that porcelain shards are siliceous in nature (SiO2~70%) and contain high Al2O3 (21.6%), Rb (388ppm) and Ba (160ppm) but have low Sr (48ppm). This composition suggests that the raw materials used for producing porcelain were silica, kaolinite and sericite which are characteristics of porcelains manufactured in Southern China. Comparatively, high Al2O3 (kaolinite) content in porcelains of the Qing Dynasty suggest improvement of quality, particularly mechanical strength, of Jingdezhen porcelain. In general, major element composition, trace metals, total rare earth elements (∑REE-67ppm) and their chondrite - normalized pattern of the Ming, Qing and late Qing period are nearly similar and appear to be made of identical raw materials.","Old Goa,Jingdezhen kiln,Chinese porcelain,Ming and Qing period,South China,Maritime trade,ICP-MS and XRF analysis,"

"the response of metal mobilization and redistribution to reoxygenation in baltic sea anoxic sediments","2022","To bring life back to anoxic coastal and sea basins, reoxygenation of anoxic/hypoxic zones has been proposed. This research focuses on the metals released during the oxidization of sediments from two locations in the anoxic Eastern Gotland Basin under a laboratory-scale study. Triplicate experimental cores and reference cores were collected from the North and South Eastern Gotland Basins. The oxygenation of the water column took place over a 96-hour experiment in a dark and 5 °C environment. In 12 and 24 hour intervals, the surface waters were exchanged and, over time, analyzed for pH, electroconductivity (EC), total organic carbon (TOC), soluble metal concentrations, and the top samples (0–10 cm) were analyzed with 3-step (E1: water-soluble, E2: exchangeable, and E3: organic-bound) sequential chemical extraction (SCE). Results show stable pH and decreasing EC in the column waters. The EC indicates that metals are released in the initial phases (12 h) of reoxygenation for both sites. Arsenic, Ba, Co, Mn, Rb, U, K, Sr, and Mo are released into the water column during the 96 hour experiment, and based on the calculations for the entire East Gotland Basin, would mean 8, 50, 0.55, 734, 53, 27, 347,178, 3468, and 156 μg L−1 are released, respectively. Elements Mn, Mo, U, and As are released in higher concentrations during the experiment than previously measured in the Eastern Gotland Basin, which provides vital information for future proposed remediation and natural geochemical processes with their known environmental impacts. The SCE results show that redox-sensitive metals (Mn, U, and Mo) are released in the highest concentrations into the solution. The relationship between the highest released metals (beside redox-sensitive) into solution over the oxygenation and their initial abundant phase is noticed, where the smallest released concentrations belong to K < Rb < Sr in E2, and As<Ba in E3, respectively.","Remediation,Eutrophication,Anoxic,Metal contamination,Water contamination,Sequential chemical extraction,"

"north atlantic forcing of millennial-scale indo-australian monsoon dynamics during the last glacial period","2013","Recent studies of the Last Glacial period Indo-Australian summer monsoon (IASM) have revealed links to both northern and southern hemisphere high latitude climate as well as to regional ocean conditions. Particular interest has been paid to the monsoon response to Heinrich events, with variability explained by meridional shifts in positioning of the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ), but this model has not been adequately tested. In addition, the shorter-lived Dansgaard/Oeschger (D/O) events have not been detected (beyond D/O-1, the Bølling/Allerød) in land-based records from the Indo-Pacific, despite their prominent expression in stalagmites from southern Asia, raising questions about the sensitivity of the IASM to these events. Here we present a Southern Hemisphere stalagmite oxygen isotopic time series from Ball Gown Cave (BGC), tropical northern Australia, located on the margins of the modern austral summer ITCZ, that spans 40–31 and 27–8 ka. Elevated IASM rainfall coincides with Heinrich stadials and the Younger Dryas, while decreased rainfall characterizes D/O interstadials, a response that is anti-phased with sites spanning the Indo-Pacific Warm Pool and with Chinese records of the East Asian summer monsoon. The BGC time series thus reveals a precipitation dipole consistent with a southward (northward) migration of the ITCZ during periods of high northern latitude cooling (warming) as the primary driver of millennial-scale IASM variability during the Last Glacial period. Our record indicates a strengthening of the IASM after the Younger Dryas period, likely as a result of rising sea level and sea surface temperatures, breaking the link with the high latitudes.","Last Glacial Maximum,Oxygen isotope,Indo-Australian summer monsoon,Kimberley,Stalagmite,"

This paper compares a covariance threshold for anomalous pCO2 (a threshold based on pCO2 and dissolved oxygen), with annual and seasonal constant thresholds, using data observed in two hydrologically contrasting areas in Osaka Bay, Japan. In one of these locations the water column is typically stratified throughout the year, whereas at the other it is vertically mixed. The covariance threshold often but not consistently outperforms the constant thresholds, but is effective in all the cases analyzed in the present study. In any season in the mixed area, and in winter in the stratified area, the possibility of false-negatives in the seasonal threshold method is smaller than or comparable with that in the covariance threshold one. In areas with large natural pCO2 variations, such as during summer in the stratified area, the covariance threshold method is efficient in detecting CO2 leakage whereas the seasonal threshold method is of little use. With a good understanding of local conditions, monitoring pCO2 with the covariance threshold method is a potentially useful but not sufficient option for leakage detection in the marine environment.","Dissolved oxygen,CO leakage,Coastal ocean,Monitoring,Detection,Partial pressure of CO,"
"gis-enabled maritime awareness system (gmas)","2009","Being aware of maritime activities is important for homeland security. We have worked with the US Coast Guard to develop a waterway visual surveillance system on Elba Island, in Savannah, GA for maritime awareness. With the system, we developed an enhanced temporal difference algorithm based on active zone (ETD-AZ) to detect waterway moving objects, including container ships, commercial vessels, small vessels, sailboats, tugboats, and dolphins, etc. In the algorithm, active zone is first defined to model the imaging locations of moving objects that appear in the waterway; the model reduces noises caused by winds, clouds, and waves in the near-view fields. A thresholded difference map is computed by using temporal difference and thresholding methods. The thresholded difference map is further processed by applying morphological operations to remove noises. A final decision rule is derived to decide whether an image contains moving objects or not based on motion pixels in thresholded difference map and in the difference map after morphological operation. The proposed ETD-AZ algorithm has been tested using 21, 844 night and day images taken from Aug. 1-2, 2008, in different weather conditions: sunny, cloudy, windy, stormy with lightening, etc. The algorithm detected 89 of 94 waterway moving objects with 5.3% false negative rate while maintaining a low false positive rate of 4.0% for a total of 21, 478 non-object images. When focusing only on vessels, it detected 78 of 79 moving vessels with a 1.3% false negative rate.","homeland security,waterway visual surveillance system,enhanced temporal difference-active zone algorithm,Active noise reduction,Savannah,image motion analysis,Marine vehicles,Clouds,US Coast Guard,Elba Island,moving object location imaging,military systems,video surveillance systems,waterway moving object detection,GMAS,GIS-enabled maritime awareness system,military computing,Containers,marine safety,object detection,Dolphins,Wind,geographic information systems,ETD-AZ algorithm,national security,Morphological operations,Object detection,Surveillance,video surveillance,maritime activities,thresholded difference map,Terrorism,"
"elemental constituents of atmospheric aerosols in recife, north-east brazil","1982","Few data are available on the inorganic atmospheric pollution in the rapidly expanding cities of South America, like Recife, on the Atlantic Coast of North-east Brazil. Therefore, the elemental composition of atmospheric aerosols was investigated for nine sites in the Recife conurbation and a fairly remote site in the area. Total aerosol samples were collected on cellulose filters for analysis by energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence and cascade impactors were used to collect the aerosols as a function of particle size for subsequent analysis by proton-induced X-ray emission. Local soil aliquots were also analysed. About eighteen elements were quantified in all cases. The average total atmospheric concentrations appeared to be well above natural levels but usually lower than, or comparable with, those of North American and European cities. Dispersal of sea spray and of local soil (often contaminated with, for example, Cu, Zn and Pb from industrial sources) contributes predominantly to the total atmospheric load in Recife. However, the particle size fraction results also indicated strong excesses in the small particle mode for S, K, V, Mn, Ni, Cu, Zn, Br and Pb, mainly in the downtown area. Again, the corresponding enrichment factors were only moderate in comparison with other published urban data.",""
"leveraging graph and deep learning uncertainties to detect anomalous maritime trajectories","2022","Understanding and representing traffic patterns are key to detecting anomalous trajectories in the transportation domain. However, some trajectories can exhibit heterogeneous maneuvering characteristics despite confining to normal patterns. Thus, we propose a novel graph-based trajectory representation and association scheme for extraction and confederation of traffic movement patterns, such that data patterns and uncertainty can be learned by deep learning (DL) models. This paper proposes the usage of a recurrent neural network (RNN)-based evidential regression model, which can predict trajectory at future timesteps as well as estimate the data and model uncertainties associated, to detect anomalous maritime trajectories, such as unusual vessel maneuvering, using automatic identification system (AIS) data. Furthermore, we utilize evidential deep learning classifiers to detect unusual turns of vessels and the loss of transmitted signal using predicted class probabilities with associated uncertainties. Our experimental results suggest that the graphical representation of traffic patterns improves the ability of the DL models, such as evidential and Monte Carlo dropout, to learn the temporal-spatial correlation of data and associated uncertainties. Using different datasets and experiments, we demonstrate that the estimated prediction uncertainty yields fundamental information for the detection of traffic anomalies in the maritime and, possibly in other domains.","Monte Carlo methods,classification,recurrent neural nets,graph,deep learning (artificial intelligence),Anomaly detection,DL models,graph-based trajectory representation,automatic identification system data,Monte Carlo dropout,graphical representation,traffic movement patterns,detect anomalous maritime trajectories,Predictive models,regression analysis,evidential deep learning,marine engineering,Data models,data patterns,pattern classification,Artificial intelligence,graph theory,RNN,regression,clustering,uncertainty,Trajectory,Uncertainty,probability,Computational modeling,traffic engineering computing,recurrent neural network-based evidential regression model,deep learning uncertainties,AIS data,"

Simulations offshore Somali coast and in a South Mediterranean Sea region showed that both low and high resolution acquisitions are feasible. For the low resolution mode a probability of successful image formation no matter the azimuth position of the receiving UAS has been estimated at nearly 100%. Whereas, for the high resolution mode it decreases to about 90%, which, if deemed unsatisfactory for the application, leads to the need for UAS to adapt its route to the actual Galileo satellite coverage.","Unmanned aerial systems,Bistatic synthetic aperture radar,Parasitic remote sensing,Civil security,Galileo constellation,"

"algorithm design of maritime wireless communication resources based on interference alignment","2022","With the increasing tension of wireless spectrum, interference has become a bottleneck problem in future wireless communication, and the urgency of interference management is particularly prominent. Traditional interference management methods have the defects of low spectral efficiency or limited interference. As a technology that can effectively improve network freedom and spectral efficiency, interference alignment can obtain greater gain compared with traditional methods, and has great potential in theory. As an effective means of interference management, interference alignment technology has been widely studied, and the difficulty of interference alignment is how to design the precoding matrix at the transmitting end and the decoding matrix at the receiving end, so as to meet the needs of system freedom. In the field of modern maritime communication, there are more and more application fields based on wireless technology, such as maritime detection, target detection and scheduling, which need to use wireless resources for data transmission, while maritime wireless resources are very tight. This paper makes a reasonable allocation of limited wireless resources to ensure the quality of various services of maritime wireless communication.

"the lama system: a “smart” magnetometer network for harbour protection","2022","This work describes the development of an underwater anti-intrusion system based on a magnetometer self-informed network, whose purpose is to detect the presence of threats in the proximity of critical infrastructures (e.g, terrorist divers in harbours). In this context, the magnetic network fills the gaps of sonar systems at the critical boundaries of the water volume to be controlled (sea bed, docks, …), where acoustic performances deteriorate due to reflections and attenuations. The system operates in a port-protection scenario, characterized by a medium-high environmental magnetic noise that can hide the diver signal (a diver is a weak, quasi-point-like, moving source). The magnetometer network processes two inputs: the environmental magnetic noise and a signal including the target magnetic signal superimposed to the same noise; the frequencies of a diver signal lie within the noise band, hence frequency filtering proves inadequate for noise removal. The basic idea underlying the system is to measure and use the noise itself to filter the overall signal; measuring noise supports a background-subtraction process that allows to extract the target signal and therefore detect the threat presence. The effectiveness of the procedure depends on the positions of magnetometers: sensors must be close enough to one another to measure the common background noise, and, at the same time, should be distant enough from one another so that just one sensor can measure the target signal. To generate alarms when a threat is detected, a real-time software application processes data and activates a visual and acoustic alarm upon identification of a magnetic anomaly. Sea trials carried out in port areas provided extremely satisfactory results in the detection of intruders. The paper presents experimental results obtained during the method validation tests, when intruders were moving in the surrounding undersea environment.","Environmental magnetism,Marine geophysics,Time series analysis,Magnetic anomaly detection,Underwater magnetic systems,Harbour protection,"
"upper mississippi pb as a mid-1800s chronostratigraphic marker in sediments from seasonally anoxic lakes in eastern canada","2013","Sediment cores from eight headwater lakes located in Southern Québec, Eastern Canada, were analyzed for Pb, stable Pb isotopes, and the radioelements 210Pb, 137Cs, 241Am and 226Ra. The depth profiles of stable Pb isotope ratios show, for the post-19th century period, the influence of several isotopically distinct anthropogenic lead sources, mainly including emissions from two Canadian smelters and from leaded gasoline combustion in Canada and in the United States. A most interesting feature of the profiles, however, is the presence of sharp stable Pb isotope ratio peaks near the depth horizon, where excess 210Pb becomes undetectable. Using a binary mixing model and assuming that natural Pb concentrations and isotopic compositions from the catchment are given by the pre-industrial sediments at the bottom of the cores, we find that a significant part of the anthropogenic Pb supplied to the sediments at this horizon originated from smelting activities in the Upper Mississippi Valley. We assess that the Pb isotope ratio peaks, also observed in the laminated sediments of the Pettaquamscutt Estuary, Rhode Island, USA, are an accurate chronostratigraphic marker for the validation of mid-19th century 210Pb-derived dates. Given that the study lakes are located up to 2000km from the Mississippi Valley, we conclude that this isotopic Pb signal provides a widely distributed time-marker that is key to validate 210Pb chronologies in environmental archives from Eastern North America.",""
"comparative analysis of positioning capability of beidou and gps in maritime islands","2022","After the full deployment of the Beidou-3 global satellite navigation system constellation, the positioning service range has been expanded from the Asia-Pacific region to the whole world. At present, most of the research on the positioning capability of Beidou system is on the mainland, and there is still room for research on the positioning capability of islands at sea. In this paper, the data of four IGS tracking stations distributed in islands are selected and solved by Anubis software. The visualization of Beidou and GPS is analyzed in five aspects: satellite visible number, standard single point positioning error, DOP value, signal-to-noise ratio, and multi-path effect. The results show that: (1) In the Asia-Pacific region, the positioning accuracy of Beidou's maritime islands is better than 0.734 m, 0.724 m, and 2.115 m in the N, E, and U directions, respectively, which is basically equivalent to GPS. Whereas, it is roughly 3 m, 3 m and 6 m lower than GPS outside the Asia-Pacific region, and the average number of visible satellites of Beidou in ANMG station and SOLO station is 15 and 11 respectively, which presumably means that the satellite density of Beidou system in the Asia-Pacific region is higher. (2) The average values of signal-to-noise ratio and multipath error of C22, C23, C24 and C25 stars of BeiDou are 41.638 dBHz and 0.574 m, respectively, which are basically comparable to those of G01, G02, G03 and G04 stars of GPS.

"maritime containers tracking trial results","2009","There are approximately 7 million maritime-style containers within Canada, and 70 million within the US. The interiors of such containers are rarely inspected. With market globalization, a large amount of these containers enter North America on a daily basis. Such containers may include contraband or dangerous items that present an economic or security risk. Despite significant security improvements, only 3 to 5 % of the maritime containers, that arrive in, or transition through, North America, go through physical inspection. Current container tracking technologies based on GPS consume high DC power, are costly, require line-of-sight with satellites, and are often too large to be covert. It is possible to overcome some of these limitations by basing the tracking system on the FM broadcast signal which is an alternative man-made signal that is reasonably ubiquitous, provides a geographically-unique frequency spectrum and is about 100,000 times as strong as a GPS satellite signal. This allows the development of a low-cost, low-power and miniature FM receiver that can record frequency spectrums and compare them to known data in order to trace the path that the container has taken for less than $10 per container. This presents the first results of highway trials (train and sea trials are currently being conducted) of such a low-cost, covert, non-GPS based technology (called 'FM Tag') that records the worldwide displacement of containers and displays the path undertaken by the container while in transit. As an added security benefit, the tag is also capable of detecting container door openings. In addition to presenting the first trial results, this covers the innovative engineering aspects of using the metal enclosure of a maritime container as a VBF antenna, thereby eliminating the need to add an external antenna and achieving the goal of being 100% covert.","maritime containers tracking,US,Inspection,Canada,VHF antennas,Global Positioning System,FM broadcast signal,metal enclosure,Containers,Globalization,frequency spectrum,containers,market globalization,GPS,Satellite broadcasting,North America,Frequency,Road transportation,container tracking technologies,VHP antenna,Power generation economics,Security,"
"intelligent marine area supervision based on ais and radar fusion","2023","A weighted track fusion algorithm is proposed to address the complexity of conventional sea monitoring data and the lack of effective and convenient monitoring methods. The new algorithm uses local information entropy and fuses data from the automatic identification system (AIS) and X-band radar. The new model employs ship monitoring data to detect five types of abnormal ship behavior: speed, course, position, ship spacing, and time abnormalities. The method weights various factors using a weight matrix built up from a distance difference matrix between different track points and calculations of the distance information entropy and residual degree using information entropy theory. We tested the proposed weighted track fusion algorithm the fusion accuracy using actual data for 2813 ships, AIS, and radar track points based on local information entropy. The resulting correlation accuracy was 95.54% for 2716 ship track points and a correlation accuracy of 90.72% for 97 ship tracks. The results indicate that the proposed algorithm is suitable for fusing multiple tracks and is more robust than traditional fusion methods.","Intelligent supervision,Abnormal behavior,Radar,AIS,"
"security in iot-enabled digital twins of maritime transportation systems","2023","The purposes are to explore the safety performance of the Maritime Transportation System (MTS) based on Digital Twins (DTs) Internet of Things (IoT) and develop maritime transportation towards intelligence and digitalization. Because the comprehensive operational security of modern MTS is not yet mature, historical transportation data of the Maritime Silk Road are acquired and preprocessed. Afterward, DTs are introduced, and relay nodes are added to data transmission paths to construct a maritime transportation DTs model based on relay cooperation IoT. Eventually, this modelâ€™s security performance is validated through simulation experiments. Relay security analysis suggests that interference information is a vital guarantee to assist in information non-disclosure, from which the constructed model can harvest energy to increase the data transmission power, thereby improving communication performance and secrecy rate. Outage probability analysis reveals that the simulated and the theoretical results are almost the same; moreover, given the systemâ€™s multi-hop paths in the same environment, the more the relays and the greater the fading index, the better the system performance and the lower the outage probability. Once the iterations reach a particular number, the node secrecy rate becomes optimal and cannot cause excessive burden to the system; besides, the power distribution can establish a new equilibrium when the nodes are in different locations, so that system security performance gets improved. The simulated value is closest to the actual result under 100% successful transmission probability and  $0.01\sim 0.05~\lambda $  value. To sum up, the constructed maritime transportation DTs model presents extraordinary transmission and security performance, providing an experimental basis for intelligent and secure maritime transportation in the future.","telecommunication network reliability,telecommunication security,telecommunication power management,Maritime Transportation System,Transportation,secure maritime transportation,historical transportation data,maritime transportation systems,Internet of Things,intelligent maritime transportation,Marine vehicles,maritime transportation DTs model,data transmission paths,relay nodes,IoT-enabled digital twins,Radio frequency,Maritime Silk Road,digital twins,comprehensive operational security,outage probability analysis,Relays,digitalization,relay cooperation IoT,node secrecy rate,communication performance,wireless channels,safety performance,relay security analysis,system performance,system security performance,cooperative communication,probability,Digital Twins Internet,data transmission power,Sensors,relay cooperation,Digital twins,Security,maritime transportation system,maritime silk road,"

"single image defogging based on illumination decomposition for visual maritime surveillance","2019","Single image fog removal is important for surveillance applications, and, recently, many defogging methods have been proposed. Due to the adverse atmospheric conditions, the scattering properties of foggy images depend on not only the depth information of scene but also the atmospheric aerosol model, which has a more prominent influence on illumination in a fog scene than that in a haze scene. However, the recent defogging methods confuse haze and fog, and they fail to consider fully the scattering properties. Thus, these methods are not sufficient to remove fog effects, especially for images in maritime surveillance. Therefore, this paper proposes a single image defogging method for visual maritime surveillance. First, a comprehensive scattering model is proposed to formulate a fog image in the glow-shaped environmental illumination. Then, an illumination decomposition algorithm is proposed to eliminate the glow effect on the airlight radiance and recover a fog layer, in which the objects at the infinite distance have uniform luminance. Second, a transmission-map estimation based on the non-local haze-lines prior is utilized to constrain the transmission map into a reasonable range for the input fog image. Finally, the proposed illumination compensation algorithm enables the defogging image to preserve the natural illumination information of the input image. In addition, a fog image dataset is established for the visual maritime surveillance. The experimental results based on the established dataset demonstrate that the proposed method can outperform the state-of-the-art methods in terms of both the subjective and objective evaluation criteria.

"biologically inspired cooperative spectrum sensing scheme for maritime cognitive radio networks","2018","Spectrum sensing is imperative to the success of maritime cognitive radio networks (MCRNs). Spectrum sensing in MCRNs is challenging because of the sea surface movement, the channel interference, and the unstable link quality. Recent research reveals that existing spectrum sensing schemes work well for lower sea states; however, they have failed to perform effectively at higher sea states. There are two disadvantages of performing spectrum sensing at higher sea states: 1) low probability of detection may also cause interference with primary system and 2) energy wastage. In this paper, a biologically inspired cooperative spectrum sensing scheme (BIC3S) is proposed to deal with the reliability and energy consumption challenges associated with the sea environment. It is based on the task allocation model of an insect colony. The proposed BIC3S chooses participating secondary users for cooperative spectrum sensing according to their given sea state. Further, it enables the secondary users to decide whether or not to perform spectrum sensing based on their sea state. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed scheme in terms of energy consumption, detection performance, and throughput. It is shown that the proposed BIC3S consumes less energy and, at the same time, achieves higher detection probability and fewer probability of false alarms compared to the existing schemes. Moreover, BIC3S provides better adaptation capabilities for the sea environment.","telecommunication network reliability,cooperative detection,cognitive radio,BIC3S,Cognitive radio network,maritime cognitive radio networks,Marine vehicles,channel interference,energy wastage,radio spectrum management,Wireless communication,task allocation model,higher sea states,unstable link quality,detection probability,low probability-of-detection,sea surface movement,sea environment,biologically inspired cooperative spectrum sensing scheme,Entropy,Sea state,radio networks,maritime communication,detection performance,Biology,insect colony,cooperative communication,signal detection,probability,energy consumption,marine communication,MCRN,spectrum sensing,Detectors,"

"coastal engineering applications of high-resolution lidar bathymetry","1998","In 1994, the US Army Corps of Engineers completed development of the Scanning Hydrographic Operational Airborne Lidar Survey (SHOALS) system, a state-of-the-art hydrographic survey instrument. Using lidar (Light Detection And Ranging) technology and operating from a Bell 212 helicopter, SHOALS remotely collects accurate, high-resolution bathymetry at a rate of 8 km2/h. A nominal depth-and-position measurement spacing of 4 m yields high-density bottom coverage of coastal projects, producing soundings from the above-water beach, or coastal structure, to depths of 40 m. Since becoming fully operational, SHOALS surveyed over 2000 km2 along the Atlantic Ocean, Pacific Ocean, Gulf of Mexico, Great Lakes, and Caribbean Sea. Survey projects varied from tidal inlets and navigation channels to beach nourishment and monitoring. These projects quantify current coastal structure condition, navigation channel alignments, and morphologic changes over time. In addition to monitoring coastal projects, sediment transport can be estimated with accurate, high-resolution bathymetry. Bathymetry can be translated into sediment transport through a combination of the sediment continuity equation, a surf zone energetics-based longshore transport formula, and bathymetric data. This paper presents the SHOALS system describing both lidar technology and the survey system. Several SHOALS data sets are presented to show today's benefits of high-resolution lidar bathymetry to the coastal engineering community.

"assessment of offshore oil/gas platform status in the northern gulf of mexico using multi-source satellite time-series images","2018","Accurate knowledge of the detailed status (location and lifetime) of each oil/gas platform is crucial for ocean management and for understanding its potential environmental impact. However, this requirement is often compromised due to incomplete data records, especially when platform abandonment is not properly planned, designed, and/or executed. The availability of multi-source optical and SAR images provides the possibility of a systematic assessment, but the ubiquitous false positives and frequent geocoding errors make it technically challenging. Here, we develop a time-series remote sensing approach (TSRS) for detecting offshore platforms and determining their status, where the technical challenges are overcome using two strategies, as follows: (i) A stepwise optimization strategy applied to individual images and time-series images to mitigate numerous noises, to select platforms from candidates, and to assess platform status; and (ii) A cross geo-correction strategy using platforms derived from high-geometric accuracy images as ground control points to rectify poorly geo-referenced images. We applied the TSRS approach to the northern Gulf of Mexico using about 26,000 moderate-resolution optical/SAR images from eight satellites spanning the period from 1982 to 2017. TSRS detected a total of 9260 (5556) platforms in both Federal and State waters, including 3140 (1803) existing platforms, 5044 (3426) removed platforms, and 1076 (327) status-to-be-determined platforms where the numbers in parentheses represent those from Federal waters. Of these TSRS platforms, 4751 coincide spatially with 5476 (77.68%) of platform records of the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) platform database; 2846 (387 in Federal waters) are not found in the BSEE platform database but are convincingly supported by data from other sources (including BSEE-pipeline-database, time-series VIIRS nighttime light products, and littoral ground-truth images), meaning that 82.04% of the TSRS-derived platforms can be directly/indirectly confirmed. A site-specific validation in East Bay using multi-temporal ground-truth aerial images indicates that, for this site, the false negative rate (FNR) is ~9.63% and the false positive rate (FPR) is only 4.44%. The detailed beginning/end dates of the TSRS platforms are mostly confirmed by the corresponding Installation/Site-clear dates recorded in the BSEE platform database. Our findings suggest that the TSRS approach is a robust and cost-effective way to assess oil/gas platform status in large regions, and our results here may complement the official database, narrow down locations for future field investigations, and provide critical information for future assessment of the potential impacts of active and decommissioned platforms on the marine environments.","Landsat,Northern Gulf of Mexico,Offshore platform,Platform status assessment,Remote sensing,SAR,Time-series,"

"risk models for maritime security, area and port force protection","2010","Asymmetric and terrorist threats stand as perhaps one of the greatest threats to maritime forces at present. Accordingly, there has been an increase in the study of problems related to this threat in the defense community. This report discusses models related to maritime security, area and port force protection. The primary focus is the discussion of an area force protection model designed to consider the situation where an escorted vessel traveling through constrained waters comes under attack by a fast, small boat. A method where discrete bursts of gunfire are averaged over time to provide an effectiveness model is presented and used to identify the likelihood of defending against such an attacker. The approach is also used to identify the effects of ship maneuvers and augmentation teams in improving the probability of a positive outcome. Three other models that examine port scenarios are presented. The first is based on the same methodologies as the area force protection model and gives a measure of the ability to neutralize an incoming threat by a shore-based or moored defender. For the others, one uses an agent-based approach to identify how the positioning of a patrol boat guarding a particular asset affects its response capabilities, while the other introduces a ship-turning model to help define the areas in a port that could be struck by a hijacked commercial vessel. For all models, an example of the type of output that can be produced is presented.","Monte Carlo methods,patrol boat guarding positioning,shore-baseddefender,augmentation teams,agent-based approach,ship-turning model,maritime security,defence industry,marine safety,area force protection model,moored defender,hijacked commercial vessel,Force,port force protection,ship maneuver effect identification,sea ports,risk models,Boats,Weapons,Security,Radiation detectors,"

"contextual verification for false alarm reduction in maritime anomaly detection","2015","Automated vessel anomaly detection is immensely important for preventing and reducing illegal activities (e.g., drug dealing, human trafficking, etc.) and for effective emergency response and rescue in a country's territorial waters. A major limitation of previously proposed vessel anomaly detection techniques is the high rate of false alarms as these methods mainly consider vessel kinematic information which is generally obtained from AIS data. In many cases, an anomalous vessel in terms of kinematic data can be completely normal and legitimate if the 'context' at the location and time (e.g., weather and sea conditions) of the vessel is factored in. In this paper, we propose a novel anomalous vessel detection framework that utilizes such contextual information to reduce false alarms through 'contextual verification'. We evaluate our proposed framework for vessel anomaly detection using massive amount of real-life AIS data sets obtained from U.S. Coast Guard. Though our study and developed prototype is based on the maritime domain the basic idea of using contextual information through 'contextual verification' to filter false alarms can be applied to other domains as well.","Kinematics,AIS Data,emergency management,vessel kinematic information,Contextual Verification,Trajectory Clustering,Anomaly Detection,contextual verification,US coast guard,Meteorology,False Alarm Reduction,illegal activities,marine engineering,automated vessel anomaly detection,false alarms,Big data,contextual information,Context,false alarm reduction,maritime anomaly detection,Real-time systems,emergency response,Tracking,Trajectory,territorial waters,AIS data,"
"study of the río de la plata turbidity front, part 1: spatial and temporal distribution","1996","The Río de la Plata is a riverine system located on the east coast of South America at 35°S. It covers 35,000 km2, it is 320 km long and 230 km wide at the mouth. The Río de la Plata drains the second largest basin in South America with an average discharge of 22,000 m3 s−1. The processes associated with the interaction of the fresh river water and the saline shelf water and tidal stirring generate a turbidity front in the outer region, which is clearly defined in the satellite images as a strong gradient in reflectance and a sharp change in water color. We use a 4 yr span of NOAA-AVHRR daily images, from September 1986 to August 1990, to determine the spatial and temporal distribution of the turbidity front. Channels 1 and 2 (visible and near-infrared) are used to digitize the fronts, and channel 4 and sea surface temperature are used as complementary information for cloud detection. From a total of 2578 images, 1274 daytime images allowed us to determine 333 positions of the front. This information is used to estimate the distribution of the frontal density, a probabilistic measure of frontal occurrence. Monthly, seasonal and annual analyses were performed. The relation of the turbidity front patterns to bathymetry, tidal dynamics, river discharge and winds were investigated. A comparison between the frontal density distribution and stratification parameters is presented. The results show a high degree of variability of the frontal distribution at the northern coast of the estuary. In this region, the frontal position varies between 57°W and 54°12′W. The westernmost location occurs in the summer months, which is coincident with minimum river discharge, predominance of easterly winds and minimum occurrence of southwesterlies. The easternmost location occurs during the spring, with strong winds from the southwest. At the southern coast the modal position of the front coincides with the 5 m isobath, although great variations to this position have been observed during years of large river discharge. The fall and winter are seasons of maximum river discharge. During these periods there is a bimodal frontal distribution with maximum values of frontal density at the northern area of Bay of Samborombón and south of Montevideo, and higher variability in the center of the river.",""
"maritime anomaly detection based on mean-reverting stochastic processes applied to a real-world scenario","2018","A novel anomaly detection procedure is presented, based on the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) mean-reverting stochastic process. The considered anomaly is a vessel that deviates from a planned route, changing its nominal velocity. In order to hide this behavior, the vessel switches off its Automatic Identification System (AIS) device for a certain time, and then tries to revert to the previous nominal velocity. The decision that has to be taken is either declaring that a deviation happened or not, relying only upon two consecutive AIS contacts. A proper statistical hypothesis testing procedure that builds on the changes in the OU process long-term velocity parameter of the vessel is the core of the proposed approach and enables for the solution of the anomaly detection problem.","real-world data,Anomaly detection,Marine vehicles,mean-reverting stochastic process,security of data,maritime security,Stochastic processes,proper statistical hypothesis testing procedure,target tracking,statistical analysis,Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process,OU process long-term velocity parameter,automatic identification system,automatic identification system device,stochastic processes,marine engineering,AIS,nominal velocity,Artificial intelligence,maritime anomaly detection,vessel switches,Trajectory,statistical hypothesis test,Ornstein-Uhlenbeck,Transponders,planned route,Navigation,"
"ship collision avoidance behaviour recognition and analysis based on ais data","2022","A novel approach is proposed to automatically identify the ship collision avoidance behaviour from ship trajectories based on an improved Sliding Window Algorithm. The approach has three main stages: (1) determining the ships’ obligations according to the Convention on the International Regulations for Preventing Collision at Sea (COLREGs); (2) assessing the rudder angle according to the true bearing of the target ship; (3) identifying the corresponding ship handling behaviour from the ship trajectory taking into account the Rate of Turn and its derivative based on the Sliding Window Algorithm. Four typical encounter scenarios are studied to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method. The approach is then applied to near collision scenarios identified in the maritime traffic off the continental coast of Portugal, which allowed the characterization of the relative and spatial distributions of the locations at which the ships take evasive manoeuvres. The results show that the approach can be applied to accurately detect the ship collision avoidance behaviour from Automatic Identification System trajectory data, and the characterization of the collision avoidance behaviour can potentially be used by situational awareness systems and as the basis for ship collision avoidance decision-making.","Ship evasive manoeuvring,Near collision scenario,Collision avoidance,Sliding window Algorithm,"
"variability and change in the west antarctic peninsula marine system: research priorities and opportunities","2019","The west Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) region has undergone significant changes in temperature and seasonal ice dynamics since the mid-twentieth century, with strong impacts on the regional ecosystem, ocean chemistry and hydrographic properties. Changes to these long-term trends of warming and sea ice decline have been observed in the 21st century, but their consequences for ocean physics, chemistry and the ecology of the high-productivity shelf ecosystem are yet to be fully established. The WAP shelf is important for regional krill stocks and higher trophic levels, whilst the degree of variability and change in the physical environment and documented biological and biogeochemical responses make this a model system for how climate and sea ice changes might restructure high-latitude ecosystems. Although this region is arguably the best-measured and best-understood shelf region around Antarctica, significant gaps remain in spatial and temporal data capable of resolving the atmosphere-ice-ocean-ecosystem feedbacks that control the dynamics and evolution of this complex polar system. Here we summarise the current state of knowledge regarding the key mechanisms and interactions regulating the physical, biogeochemical and biological processes at work, the ways in which the shelf environment is changing, and the ecosystem response to the changes underway. We outline the overarching cross-disciplinary priorities for future research, as well as the most important discipline-specific objectives. Underpinning these priorities and objectives is the need to better define the causes, magnitude and timescales of variability and change at all levels of the system. A combination of traditional and innovative approaches will be critical to addressing these priorities and developing a co-ordinated observing system for the WAP shelf, which is required to detect and elucidate change into the future.","Primary production,Physical oceanography,Southern Ocean,Ecosystems,Sea ice,Nutrient and carbon cycling,Antarctica,Climate change,West Antarctic Peninsula,"
"synthetic trajectory extraction for maritime anomaly detection","2018","In the maritime domain, the main goal for large vessels is to drive as fast and efficiently as possible from one harbour to the next. This results in vessels following quite distinct routes. Deviations from these routes can be seen as indicators for illegal or at least suspicious behaviour. In order to extract these routes, clustering algorithms can be used, that will store the traffic patterns as synthetic trajectories. A vessel can be assigned to a specific route or a deviation from the routes can be detected by evaluating these route models. A challenge in designing the synthetic trajectories lies in the faithful representation, sparsity of data, treatment of outliers and split-up of routes. Here, a novel approach to model the uncertainty of the vessels movements while following a route is introduced: A cluster is now represented by a trajectory consisting of segments. Due to obstacles like shallow waters, a route might split up which will generate sub-segments. Instead of storing all cluster points, the position, speed, and course of the vessels are attached to each segment in form of normal distributions. Using these attributes, the probability of a deviation from the given trajectory can be estimated.","Clustering algorithms,Kernel,vessels movements,Anomaly detection,anomaly detection,traffic patterns,security of data,trajectory representation,ships,clustering algorithms,marine engineering,maritime domain,Heating systems,route models,pattern clustering,Artificial intelligence,maritime anomaly detection,synthetic trajectory extraction,Trajectory,data sparsity,probability,Gaussian distribution,data handling,"
"geospatial data analysis for global maritime risk assessment using the discrete global grid system","2021","The effective management of the safety of navigation by coastguards is challenged by the complexity in quantifying and describing the relative risk of accidents occurrence. The discovery of patterns in observation data is reliant on the collection and analysis of significant volumes of relevant heterogenous spatial datasets. Conventional approaches of risk mapping which aggregate vessel traffic and incident data into Cartesian grids can result in misrepresentation due to inherent inadequacies in this spatial data format. In this paper, we explore how the Discrete Global Grid System (DGGS) overcomes these limitations through the development of global maps of incident rates at multiple resolutions. The results demonstrate hot spots of relative high risk across different regions and clearly show that DGGS is more suited to global analysis than conventional grids. This work contributes to a greater understanding of both the disposition of maritime risk and the advantages of adopting DGGS in supporting big data analysis.","Risk management,Discrete Global Grid System,Safety,Navigation,Geospatial analysis,Spatial databases,Big Data,Maritime Risk,Automatic Identification System,Graphical models,Planning,"
"atmospheric circulation patterns in the arab region and its relationships with saudi arabian surface climate: a preliminary assessment","2015","This paper establishes and analyses the principal circulation patterns in and around Saudi Arabia (domain: 10°E–70°E; 5°N–40°N) based on the daily mean sea-level pressure (MSLP) 0.75°×0.75° gridded data derived from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) re-analysis ERA-Interim for the period 1979–2012. Association of the circulation patterns to the local climate is investigated using observed daily temperature and rainfall data at 27 locations over Saudi Arabia for the period 1979–2010. Using the widely-used mathematical technique principal component analysis (PCA) we determine with MSLP data the principal patterns. We only analyse data for the wet season (October–May). The automated typing procedure establishes 12 circulation types, which represent all the main synoptic features especially those that originate from the Mediterranean, the European and African continents, Siberia, and also the Red and Arabian seas. There is a strong link between the circulation types and surface climate that is synoptically and spatially interpretable. Particular circulation types are associated with specific climatic conditions across the country: rainfall is linked with Types 9, 10 and 11, whilst warm days (nights) with 1, 2, 3, 9, 10, 11 and 12 (1, 2, 3, 10, 11 and 12), and cold days (nights) with 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 11 and 12 (2, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8). In terms of regional influences, the circulation types also exhibit specific links between certain types and climatic divisions across Saudi Arabia.","Saudi Arabia,Climate patterns,Arabian Peninsula,Circulation,"
"ocean of things : affordable maritime sensors with scalable analysis","2019","DARPA's Ocean of Things (OoT) program enables persistent maritime situational awareness over large ocean areas by deploying thousands of low-cost, intelligent floats that drift as a distributed sensor network.

The floats periodically transmit processed data, or immediately report events based on internal prioritization schemes. Messages travel via commercial satellite to a government cloud for storage and real-time analysis. Cloud-based data analytics feature machine learning aimed at discovering emergent features and behaviors from sparse data.

"gps based system for detection and control of maritime boundary intruding boats","2016","Maritime boundary violation and intrusion by fishing boats has been a huge concern not only for the errant fishermen and their families but also a massive burden on governments and public alike, due to the complexity of the issue and the naivety of the people involved. The chief solution is to safe guard these fishermen from the danger which they are encountering in everyday life for their livelihood. Hence, keeping the above problems in mind, this paper proposes a GPS based boat detection and tracking system which would safe guard the fishermen from the potential dangers they might face by giving them pre-warning in case of trespassing. In particular, we are proposing to control the navigation so that the fishermen are directed to safe region. This system was designed and demonstrated already. In the proposed system, the maritime boundary is detected using GPS in real time but for our demonstration purposes, RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) readers and tags were used in which the location detection and retrieval was followed by the vital information being sent to the Peripheral Interface Controller (PIC) for taking corresponding actions.","maritime boundary violation,Radiofrequency identification,Monitoring,maritime boundary intruding boat detection,Global Positioning System,PIC,ZigBee,military systems,navigation control,microcontrollers,location retrieval,object tracking,marine safety,peripheral interface controller,fishing boats,boats,RFID,object detection,peripheral interfaces,Real-time systems,GPS,RFID readers,location detection,radiofrequency identification,Zigbee,maritime boundary intruding boat control,trespassing,Boats,Protocols,RFID tags,GPS based boat detection and tracking system,"
"clutter suppression and target tracking by the low-rank representation for airborne maritime surveillance radar","2020","Moving target detection is of vital importance to maritime security and maritime resource protection. However, the detection of slow or weak targets is difficult based on traditional methods. A new detection method is proposed by using the different motion variations of radar moving target and sea clutter in the range-Doppler spectrum sequence. The first step in implementing this method is the separation of moving target and sea clutter by the low-rank representation, in which the target and clutter are modeled as foreground and background components. Subsequently, a sea clutter discriminator is constructed within the sea clutter bandwidth to further remove the sea clutter (false alarms) that exists in the foreground. The proposed method can reduce the sea clutter power while maintaining the target power and improve the detection rate of moving targets, especially slow or weak targets. Data collected with airborne maritime surveillance radar in maritime moving target indication (MMTI) mode are used to validate the performance of the proposed method. The experimental results demonstrate that the improvement in the signal-to-clutter ratio (SCR) obtained with the proposed method is better than that obtained with space-time adaptive processing (STAP, including 1DT-STAP, 3DT-STAP and sparse-STAP) and principal component pursuit (PCP) methods; additionally, the figure of merit (FOM) of the proposed method is higher than that of the constant false alarm rate (CFAR) and PCP method. Furthermore, the tracks of ships are obtained by applying a location constraint to the foreground sequence.","airborne radar,range-Doppler sequence,marine radar,sea clutter power,detection method,target detection,radar clutter,clutter suppression,maritime security,weak targets,target detection and tracking,airborne maritime surveillance radar,signal-to-clutter ratio,target tracking,low-rank representation,target power,object detection,search radar,maritime moving target indication mode,Clutter suppression,sea clutter bandwidth,Radar clutter,radar signal processing,space-time adaptive processing,Airborne radar,detection rate,Clutter,sea clutter discriminator,Object detection,Surveillance,slow targets,Radar detection,"
"maritime pattern extraction from ais data using a genetic algorithm","2016","The long term prediction of maritime vessels' destinations and arrival times is essential for making an effective logistics planning. As ships are influenced by various factors over a long period of time, the solution cannot be achieved by analyzing sailing patterns of each entity separately. Instead, an approach is required, that can extract maritime patterns for the area in question and represent it in a form suitable for querying all possible routes any vessel in that region can take. To tackle this problem we use a genetic algorithm (GA) to cluster vessel position data obtained from the publicly available Automatic Identification System (AIS). The resulting clusters are treated as route waypoints (WP), and by connecting them we get nodes and edges of a directed graph depicting maritime patterns. Since standard clustering algorithms have difficulties in handling data with varying density, and genetic algorithms are slow when handling large data volumes, in this paper we investigate how to enhance the genetic algorithm to allow fast and accurate waypoint identification. We also include a quad tree structure to preprocess data and reduce the input for the GA. When the route graph is created, we add post processing to remove inconsistencies caused by noise in the AIS data. Finally, we validate the results produced by the GA by comparing resulting patterns with known inland water routes for two Dutch provinces.","data mining,Clustering algorithms,Genetic algorithms,vessel position data cluster,marine navigation,directed graph,maritime pattern extraction,sailing pattern analysis,quadtrees,Biological cells,genetic algorithms,genetic algorithm,ships,Genetic Algorithms,automatic identification system,inland water routes,Dutch provinces,logistics planning,Automatic Identification System,quad tree structure,Data Mining,directed graphs,pattern clustering,Artificial intelligence,route querying,maritime vessel destination prediction,Pattern Recognition,Logistics,Synchromodal Logistics,long term prediction,route waypoints,Boats,logistics data processing,Data mining,AIS data,arrival time prediction,data handling,"
"ais data visualization for maritime spatial planning (msp)","2016","The constant increase in marine traffic and the simultaneous growth of the demand for exploiting marine areas (e.g., installing offshore wind power plants) require an adequate planning strategy for managing high traffic volumes. Maritime Spatial Planning (MSP) is the process of public development of an allocation plan for distributing, both spatially and temporally, human activities in marine areas. The adoption of e-Navigation is a possible solution for improving safety and security at sea by integrating maritime information on board and ashore. Automatic Identification System (AIS) data represents a fundamental source of information, since the analysis of AIS data can highlight the presence of congested areas as well as of illegal actions, such as smuggling, pollution, and unauthorized phishing in protected areas. Indeed, those activities are often characterized by abnormal manoeuvres that can be recognized by analyzing the routes of the vessels. However, the huge dimension of the AIS data to process requires the adoption of careful strategies for the data visualization. In this paper, we present a complete pipeline for visualizing ship routes from raw AIS data, which is a fundamental pre-requisite for carrying out a significant AIS-based route analysis, and describe a real case study, where 90 million AIS records, corresponding to one month of world-wide observations, are visualized using only open-source software.","AIS data visualization,route analysis,intelligent transport systems,e-Navigation,AIS data,"
"shelf-wide analyses of sand wave migration using gis: a case study on the netherlands continental shelf","2023","Shelf seas often display rhythmic bedforms, of which tidal sand waves are the most relevant to study from an engineering point of view due to their dimensions and dynamic nature. Environmental conditions such as water depth, flow velocities and grain size vary across entire shelf regions, consequently influencing the characteristics of tidal sand waves, including migration rates. However, as opposed to site-specific analyses, shelf sea-wide analyses on sand wave migration are scarce. Through the use of timeseries of bathymetric data, we investigate the spatial variability of sand wave migration on the scale of the Netherlands Continental Shelf (NCS). Two existing data-driven techniques, Pairs of Source and Target Points (PSTP) and Spatial Cross Correlation (SCC), were implemented in a Geographic Information System (GIS). Through testing at four sites on the NCS, PSTP was deemed the preferred technique for a shelf-wide analysis and was hence used to quantify the NCS-wide migration rates and directions. To illustrate the spatial variability, the quantified migration rates and directions were averaged per km2. For the NCS in general, migration to the south-west or north-east at typical rates between 0 and 3 m/year was found. The south-western region of the NCS demonstrated migration rates below 0.5 m/year with migration directions alternating over short distances. The north-eastern region exhibited uniform migration to the north-east at rates which gradually increased when in closer proximity to the Wadden Islands. Typical rates in this region were found to be between 2 and 8 m/year. The highest migration rates were observed near coastal regions and on top of sandbanks. The presence of these sandbanks strongly deflects the migration directions of superimposed sand waves at a number of locations. The analysis performed within this study demonstrates valuable insights into methods that can be used to evaluate shelf-wide regions of interest. A deeper understanding of the dynamic nature of the North Sea bed assists in optimising hydrographic re-survey policies, critical infrastructure planning and subsequent monitoring. Furthermore, this study may offer a wider set of tools that could be used for correlating sand wave migration to its governing physical mechanisms and environmental parameters.","North Sea,Data analysis,Spatial variation,Tidal sand wave migration,GIS,Netherlands Continental Shelf,"
"discovering themes and trends in transportation research using topic modeling","2017","Transportation research is a key area in both science and engineering. In this paper, we present an empirical analysis of 17,163 articles published in 22 leading transportation journals from 1990 to 2015. We apply a latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model on article abstracts to infer 50 key topics. We show that those characterized topics are both representative and meaningful, mostly corresponding to established sub-fields in transportation research. These identified fields reveal a research landscape for transportation. Based on the results of LDA, we quantify the similarity of journals and countries/regions in terms of their aggregated topic distributions. By measuring the variation of topic distributions over time, we find some general research trends, such as topics on sustainability, travel behavior and non-motorized mobility are becoming increasingly popular over time. We also carry out this temporal analysis for each journal, observing a high degree of consistency for most journals. However, some interesting anomaly, such as special issues on particular topics, are detected from temporal variation as well. By quantifying the temporal trends at the country/region level, we find that countries/regions display clearly distinguishable patterns, suggesting that research communities in different regions tend to focus on different sub-fields. Our results could benefit different parties in the academic community—including researchers, journal editors and funding agencies—in terms of identifying promising research topics/projects, seeking for candidate journals for a submission, and realigning focus for journal development.","Research policy,Topic modeling,Transportation research,Publication data,"
"growth response of scots pines in polar-alpine tree-line to a warming climate","2017","Coniferous trees at the alpine and polar tree lines of the Northern Hemisphere represent the outermost limit of their ecological range. Under such conditions, even small temperature variations may cause growth responses, which therefore can be used as indicators for changing environmental conditions. In this study we analysed the radial growth of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) along a latitudinal and altitudinal gradient at six locations in the polar and alpine tree-line ecotone in Finnish Lapland. We evaluated the effect of climatic trends on pine growth in relation to tree age and region, specifying a northern and a southern region in the study area. We found a response of Scots pine to climatic variations until the 1980s, but not to the current warming period. Increasing growth trends could be detected since 2000 in the radial growth of southern located trees, predominantly of juvenile ages, while the northern trees did not respond significantly to the current warming. In the north recent warmer and wetter conditions during winter time, inducing snow loads, wind damages, diseases and frost damages possibly masked the benefits of warmer conditions. The missing link between warming and radial growth would affect the use of tree-rings as proxy for past climate and for predictions for forest extension in polar-alpine tree-line sites.","Environmental change,Tree age,Tree line,Growth response,Latitudinal and altitudinal gradient,Dendroecology,"

"on the effectiveness of ai-assisted anomaly detection methods in maritime navigation","2020","The automatic identification system (AIS) has become an essential tool for maritime security. Nevertheless, how to effectively use the static and dynamic voyage information of the AIS data in maritime traffic situation awareness is still a challenge. This paper presents a comparative study of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques on their effectiveness in dealing with various anomalies in maritime domain using the AIS data. The AIS on-off switching (OOS) anomaly is critical in maritime security, since AIS technology is susceptible to manipulation and it can be switched on and off to hide illegal activities. Thus, we try to detect and distinguish between intentional and non-intentional AIS OOS anomalies through our AI -assisted anomaly detection framework. We use AIS data, in particular positional and navigational status of vessels, to study the effectiveness of seven AI techniques, such as artificial neural network, support vector machine, logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, decision tree, random forest and naive Bayes, in detecting the AIS OOS anomalies. Our experimental results show that ANN and SVM are the most suitable techniques in detecting the AIS OOS anomalies with 99.9% accuracy. Interestingly, the ANN model outperforms others when trained with a balanced (i.e., same order of samples per class) dataset, and SVM, on the other hand, is suitable when training dataset is unbalanced.","maritime traffic situation awareness,AI-assisted anomaly detection,decision trees,Support vector machines,logistic regression,Anomaly detection,static voyage information,random forests,ANN,marine navigation,Feature extraction,security of data,maritime security,k-nearest neighbors,regression analysis,AIS technology,naive Bayes,neural nets,naive Bayes methods,automatic identification system,marine safety,marine engineering,support vector machines,maritime navigation,dynamic voyage information,maritime domain,random forest,SVM,Artificial intelligence,AIS on-off switching anomaly,nearest neighbour methods,artificial neural network,Training,Trajectory,support vector machine,nonintentional AIS OOS anomalies,Navigation,artificial intelligence,decision tree,AIS data,"
"enabling maritime risk assessment using natural language processing-based deep learning techniques","2020","Maritime vessels around the world risk encountering dangerous situations during their voyages such as piracy, kidnappings, hijackings, and smugglings. Such dangers may put crews at risk and potentially cause extensive damage to both the vessel and its cargo. Maritime risk assessment is a process of analyzing such factors to positively impact the safety and timeliness of operations. Analyzing the high-risk areas in seas and oceans can help vessels route around areas with previously recorded high levels of dangerous activities. This information is scraped and extracted from various maritime documents, including newspaper articles, social media, incident blogs, and operational reports. After textual data sources are parsed, it is possible to use this extracted information as training datasets into a Machine Learning (ML) model using Natural Language Processing (NLP) Deep Learning (DL) techniques. With these methods, we can perform document classification, risk extraction, text summarization, topic modeling, and information extraction in an automated manner. Methods that are used include the bag-of words (BOW) approach and, in particular, the use of Named Entity Recognition (NER) to identify specific areas around the world that are considered a risk to a particular voyage. Once this information is processed, the model can determine and aggregate specific areas of high-risk activity. We propose a Maritime Event Log (MEL) pipeline using DL methods. This pipeline includes binary document classification (DC) to extract positive instances of incidents, an incident type classification (IC,) and an information extraction module (IE) including date and location and ship type extraction. With such information available, it is possible to avoid dangerous situations, which may have a significant level of impact on the safety and success rate of maritime operations.","Bit error rate,Pipelines,newspaper articles,Text categorization,Hidden Markov models,deep learning (artificial intelligence),Information retrieval,machine learning model,maritime vessels,information retrieval,natural language processing,maritime risk assessment,safety,bag-of words approach,high-risk activity,information extraction module,ships,marine safety,marine engineering,maritime event log pipeline,vessels route,operational reports,ship type extraction,named entity recognition,risk management,pattern classification,incident type classification,Classification algorithms,maritime documents,text summarization,incident blogs,Training,risk extraction,textual data sources,text analysis,deep learning techniques,social media,maritime operations,binary document classification,topic modeling,"
"the impact of climate change on the storm surges of the mediterranean sea: coastal sea level responses to deep depression atmospheric systems","2023","This study aims to systematically assess the impacts of projected climate change on episodic events of sea level elevation in coastal areas of the Mediterranean, induced by severe weather conditions identified as deep depressions. We try to add new insight in the long-term, climatic timescale, identification of affected parts of the Mediterranean coastal zone correlated to low atmospheric pressure systems, indicative of the Mediterranean basin during the 21st century. To achieve this goal, an integrated quantitative assessment is proposed by combining projections from available and established, green-house gasses emission/concentration scenarios (based on Representative Concentration Pathways; RCP 4.5 and 8.5) with advanced numerical modelling and statistical post-processing for the definition of cyclonic weather impacts on characteristic coastal zone hotspots. To this end, climate projections and outputs from three Regional Climate Models (RCMs) of the Med-CORDEX initiative at the Mediterranean basin scale are used and extensively evaluated against re-analysis data. These atmospheric datasets feed a robust storm surge model (MeCSS) for the simulation of barotropic hydrodynamics (sea level elevation and currents) thoroughly validated against in situ sea level observations by tide-gauges. Our results corroborate a projected storminess attenuation for the end of the 21st century, yet local differentiations in storm surge maxima around the Mediterranean coastal zone are pinpointed. Moreover, a slight reduction of average storm-induced Mean Sea Level (MSL; component attributed solely to the meteorological residual of sea level elevation) is also apparent towards the end of the 21st century. Extreme storm surge magnitudes range between 0.35 and 0.50 m in the Mediterranean with higher values along parts of its northern coasts (Venice lagoon, Gulf of Lions, northern Adriatic and Aegean Seas, etc.) and the Gulf of Gabes in its southern part. Overall, the spatial distributions of surge maxima are estimated to remain similar to those of the past throughout the entire Mediterranean coastal zone. Differentiations between the two scenarios (RCP4.5-8.5) used are obvious, not so much related to the spatiotemporal distribution of storm surge maxima, which shows a very stable pattern, but more in terms of their magnitudes. Indicatively, a decrease of surge maxima from -30% to -2% can be observed towards the end of the 21st century, especially for RCP8.5-driven MeCSS simulations. This is a spatially averaged estimation, yet for some specific coastal sites in Croatia, Spain Italy, and France, such as Rovinj, Bakar, Toulon, Trieste, Ajaccio, Genova, Marseilles, Naples, Venice, Cagliari, Ancona, Ibixa, and Barcelona, the storm surge maxima might increase from 1% to 22% under different RCM/RCP combinations towards the end of the 21st century. Our analysis leads to the quantification of deep depression systems’ effect on the coastal sea level elevation due to storm surges towards 2100. The strongest correlations of deep depression events to high sea levels are observed in several parts along the northern Mediterranean coasts (Gulfs of Valencia and Lions, Ligurian and northern Adriatic Seas). They are followed by mid-latitude areas around Corsica, Sardinia, the mid-zonal Italian Peninsula and the Adriatic, and the northern Aegean Sea. The influence of deep depressions on storm surges is lower for Sicily, South Italy, Peloponnese, Crete, the southern Aegean archipelago, and Alboran Sea. The only exceptions in the generally unaffected southern Mediterranean littorals are the Gulfs of Gabes and Alexandretta. These apply to the 20th century; however, they seem to repeat for the 21st century estimations, with even more pronounced differentiations between the southern and the northern parts. A projected northward shift of the main deep depression centres over the Mediterranean towards the end of the 21st century, is likely the reason for the latter. The climate change signal (difference of Future–Reference Period) of the deep cyclones’ effect on the episodic increases of coastal sea level seems to have a very clear pattern of slight attenuation in certain regions, i.e., Sardinia, Corsica, the Ligurian and Adriatic Seas, and the entire Italian peninsula for all RCM-fed implementations towards the end of the 21st century. Conditionally, this is the case for the Gulf of Valencia, the north-western African coasts, the Alboran, Ionian, Aegean, and Libyan Sea coasts, under specific combinations of RCM/RCP forcings. On the other hand, a possible increase of the Mediterranean deep depressions’ influence on the coastal storm surges might be the case for the Gulf of Lions, the Ionian, Aegean and Levantine Sea basins, covering the north-central and north-eastern coasts of Africa. In general, a positive influence of deep depressions to storm surge maxima would probably refer to areas of mid-to-high storm surge maxima (e.g., Aegean, Ionian, Gulf of Lions or Valencia or Gabes, etc.), but not the highest throughout the basin (e.g., Venice lagoon, Ligurian, Adriatic, etc.). In the latter coastal regions, however, intense local wind forcing mechanisms (i.e., Scirocco) are bound to play an essential role in the formation of high storm surges. The produced results can be used in focused studies for integrated hydrologic/hydrodynamic modelling under projected climate change conditions in the 21st century.","Mediterranean Sea,Deep depression,Sea surface height,Coastal zone,Representative Concentration Pathway,Inverse barometer effect,Storm surge,Climate change,Med-CORDEX,"

"trajectory pattern extraction and anomaly detection for maritime vessels","2021","Trajectory analysis and extraction of trajectory patterns are crucial to enhance marine safety and marine status awareness. The major data source for such analysis is Automatic Identification System (AIS), which publishes data related to movement of the ship while cruising. AIS broadcasts information including type of ship, identity number, state, destination, estimated time of arrival (ETA), location, speed, direction, and cargo. In this paper, we focus on extracting a variety of trajectory patterns for maritime vessels. The first group of analysis we focus on is arrival port, arrival time, and next position prediction on AIS messages, which are useful to aid maritime operators. We propose three different approaches for the prediction of marine vessel movement. As the second type of analysis, anomaly detection on marine vessel trajectory is studied. For vessel movement prediction, the experiments show that the proposed solutions brought improvement against conventional supervised learning approaches.

"paleotemperature reconstructions using speleothem fluid inclusion analyses from hungary","2021","The combined use of the stable isotope compositions of speleothem carbonate and inclusion-hosted water presents great potential in paleotemperature reconstructions, due to the various temperature-dependent isotope fractionations detected in cave systems and their environment. This paper evaluates the applicational possibilities of hydrogen and oxygen isotope measurements of inclusion-hosted water and its host calcite, in three different approaches: i) direct determination of calcite-water oxygen isotope fractionation by measuring inclusion water and carbonate compositions, ii) calculation of water oxygen isotope composition from hydrogen isotope data and of temperature from the inferred calcite-water fractionation, and iii) calculation of formation temperature from measured hydrogen isotope data and its temperature dependence in the modern precipitation water. Fluid inclusion oxygen and hydrogen isotope compositions as well as calcite oxygen isotope compositions were determined for five speleothem occurrences in Hungary. Although the background processes are not resolved, calculations involving measured calcite and water oxygen isotope compositions yielded unrealistic paleotemperatures, likely because of syn-formation isotope fractionation processes and diagenetic alterations. The hydrogen isotope data may yield realistic temperatures, provided that long-term isotopic composition - temperature relationships are known and the stable hydrogen isotope composition of the precipitation waters in the study area is temperature-controlled. Winter half-year and annual isotope-temperature relationships (δ2H/T gradients) were calculated using multidecadal isotope composition records from the Global Network of Isotopes in Precipitation (GNIP), gridded surface temperatures, and precipitation amounts from the E-OBS 21.0e database. The calculations yielded a paleotemperature record for the last ~250 ka, with average precisions ranging from ±0.6 °C for interglacial to ±2.4 °C for glacial periods. Clumped isotope analyses of cave-hosted flowstones support the inferred formation temperatures based on gradients, while detection of kinetic fractionations by combined hydrogen and oxygen isotope analyses of calcite and inclusion water lead to filtering clumped isotope (Δ47) data and more coherent Δ47-temperature relationships.","Fluid inclusion,Paleotemperature reconstruction,Clumped isotope,Speleothem,Stable isotope composition,Calcite,"
"an adaptive ionosphere clutter suppression and target detection method for hfswr maritime surveillance","2023","High-frequency surface wave radar (HFSWR) as a maritime surveillance facility faces the tough challenges. One of them is that various unwanted echo components constantly destroy the detection performance of HFSWR, especially the dynamically changing ionosphere clutter. This article proposes an adaptive ionosphere clutter suppression and target detection algorithm (AICSTD) based on improved higher order singular value decomposition (HOSVD) and deep learning network. First, we analyze the multiple-dimensional characteristics of different types of ionosphere clutter echo data. Then, refer to the multichannel HFSWR echo data structure, we apply simplified HOSVD and orthogonal subspace projection to eliminate the unwanted echo component and, meanwhile, preserve the target echo. The key parameter of simplified HOSVD is determined by the mean structural similarity (MSSIM) index, which contributes to reduce the computation complexity of the proposed method. Finally, we improved the deep learning network to detect the targets in various behaviors after the clutter suppression. In order to address the issue of limited clutter data, transfer learning based on historical radar echo data is applied. A thorough experimental analysis on various real clutter data shows that the proposed method performs competitively. Our method shows a superior performance over many state-of-the-art clutter suppression methods, with a covered target detection accuracy of 92.4% under strong spread clutter background.","Ionosphere,structural similarity (SSIM) index,higher order singular value decomposition (HOSVD),ionosphere clutter suppression,Tensors,Clutter,Deep learning,Object detection,Doppler effect,target detection,high-frequency surface wave radar (HFSWR),Reflection,"
"characterizing the vertical profile of aerosol particle extinction and linear depolarization over southeast asia and the maritime continent: the 2007–2009 view from caliop","2013","Vertical profiles of 0.532μm aerosol particle extinction coefficient and linear volume depolarization ratio are described for Southeast Asia and the Maritime Continent. Quality-screened and cloud-cleared Version 3.01 Level 2 NASA Cloud Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) 5-km Aerosol Profile datasets are analyzed from 2007 to 2009. Numerical simulations from the U.S. Naval Aerosol Analysis and Predictive System (NAAPS), featuring two-dimensional variational assimilation of NASA Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer and Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer quality-assured datasets, combined with regional ground-based lidar measurements, are considered for assessing CALIOP retrieval performance, identifying bias, and evaluating regional representativeness. CALIOP retrievals of aerosol particle extinction coefficient and aerosol optical depth (AOD) are high over land and low over open waters relative to NAAPS (0.412/0.312 over land for all data points inclusive, 0.310/0.235 when the per bin average is used and each is treated as single data points; 0.102/0.151 and 0.086/0.124, respectively, over ocean). Regional means, however, are very similar (0.180/0.193 for all data points and 0.155/0.159 when averaged per normalized bin), as the two factors offset one another. The land/ocean offset is investigated, and discrepancies attributed to interpretation of particle composition and a-priori assignment of the extinction-to-backscatter ratio (“lidar ratio”) necessary for retrieving the extinction coefficient from CALIOP signals. Over land, NAAPS indicates more dust present than CALIOP algorithms are identifying, indicating a likely assignment of a higher lidar ratio representative of more absorptive particles. NAAPS resolves more smoke over water than identified with CALIOP, indicating likely usage of a lidar ratio characteristic of less absorptive particles to be applied that biases low AOD there. Over open waters except within the Bay of Bengal, aerosol particle scattering is largely capped below 1.5km MSL, though ground-based lidar measurements at Singapore differ slightly from this finding. Significant aerosol particle presence over land is similarly capped near 3.0km MSL over most regions. Particle presence at low levels regionally, except over India, is dominated by relatively non-depolarizing particles. Industrial haze, sea salt droplets and fresh smoke are thus most likely present.","Southeast Asia,Lidar,Aerosol particle scattering,CALIPSO,Aerosol composition,Maritime Continent,"
"palaeomagnetism and magnetic anisotropy of carboniferous red beds from the maritime provinces of canada: evidence for shallow palaeomagnetic inclinations and implications for north american apparent polar wander","2010","A palaeomagnetic and magnetic anisotropy study was conducted on the lower-middle Carboniferous Maringouin and Shepody red bed formations of the Maritime Provinces of Canada to detect and correct inclination shallowing. Because of the shallow inclinations commonly observed in red beds and the strong dependence of North America's Palaeo-Mesozoic apparent polar wander (APW) on red beds, inclination shallowing may substantially affect large portions of North America's APW path. Hematite is the primary magnetic mineral carrier in these red beds, accompanied by secondary magnetite, maghemite, goethite and pigmentary hematite. Thermal and chemical demagnetization of the Shepody Fm. successfully isolated characteristic remanence directions of D= 177Â°, I= 20.4Â°, Î±95= 6.5Â°, N= 19 and D= 177.8Â°I= 17.7Â°, Î±95= 6.9Â°, N= 16, respectively. Thermal demagnetization of the Maringouin Fm. isolated a characteristic remanence direction of D= 178.7Â°, I= 24.9Â°, Î±95= 14.5Â°, N= 9.High field anisotropy of isothermal remanence followed by alternating field and thermal cleaning on leached samples was used to isolate the fabric of hematite. Individual particle anisotropy was measured directly from magnetic separates using a new technique. Hematite's magnetic fabric and particle anisotropy were used to apply an inclination correction. Our inclination corrections indicate up to 10Â° of inclination shallowing, corresponding to corrected palaeopole positions of 27.2Â°N, 118.3Â°E, A95= 6.2Â° and 27.4Â°N, 117.2Â°E, A95= 13.1Â° for the Shepody and Maringouin formations, respectively. This correction corresponds to a âˆ¼ 6Â° increase in colatitude for Carboniferous North America, which translates into approximately a 650 km change in North America's palaeogeographic position. The proposed position of North America supports a Pangea B-type reconstruction.","Palaeomagnetism applied to Tectonics,Magnetic mineralogy and petrology,Palaeomagnetism applied to geologic processes,Magnetic fabrics and anisotropy,Rock and mineral magnetism,"

"magnetic detection of ship ballast deposits and anchorage sites in king herod's roman harbour, caesarea maritima, israel","2009","Ballast stone deposits are a common feature of sediments in ancient harbour basins but are often overlooked as a potential source of archaeological information. Recent geophysical investigations at Caesarea Maritima in Israel have discovered a thick, laterally extensive ballast layer in the area seaward of the 1st c. BC Roman harbour. The ballast deposits were identified by low-relief mounds on the seabed with elevated magnetic intensities. Jet probing and excavation of magnetic anomalies at several locations revealed a 20–60cm thick rubble layer containing large quantities of Late Roman and Byzantine pottery, local sedimentary boulders (kurkar sandstone, limestone cobbles) and foreign igneous and metamorphic boulders (granite, schist, volcanics; ca. 50%). The foreign boulders and pottery identify the rubble layer as ballast and ships refuse jettisoned by merchant ships outside the harbour. The strong magnetic contrast between the ballast deposits and the natural seabed sediments is attributed to the high magnetic susceptibility (>10−3SI) of crystalline boulders and pottery materials within the ballast rubble. AMS 14C and OSL dates and pottery evidence indicate the ballast accumulation began in the Late Roman period (ca. 200–330 AD) and continued well into the Late Byzantine (ca. 7th c. AD). The main phase of ballast deposition (ca. 4th–5th c. AD) coincided with a decline in the state of Caesarea's harbour following a destructive tsunami event in the early 2nd c. AD and records a shift to a more intensive use of the area seaward of the harbour as an anchorage and ballast lightening area.","Harbour,Magnetic survey,Caesarea Maritima,Ballast,Anchorages,"

The localization is achieved by what is essentially a multilateration technique, which can be applied while the transmitting platform is also in motion. The algorithms and the accuracy predictions, as a function of the number of transmitters, have been experimentally confirmed via a dedicated experimental campaign, where two different maritime targets were detected by up to 12 GNSS satellites belonging to different satellite constellations (GPS, GLONASS, and Galileo) simultaneously.

"locating submerged prehistoric settlements: a new underwater survey method using water-jet coring and micro-geoarchaeological techniques","2021","In the past few decades the field of submerged prehistory has produced important data highlighting ancient coastal habitation across the globe. Most prehistoric underwater sites are discovered by chance (e.g., by industry, fishermen or recreational divers). New methods for detecting submerged prehistoric settlements have been developed using sophisticated remote sensing devices, yet with limited success. Simple, practical, and inexpensive methods for locating submerged settlements remain rare. Over 60 years of underwater archaeology and submerged prehistory in Israel, specifically along the Carmel coast, has led to a model for locating and studying submerged settlements, based on sand removal by storms. This study aimed to take this model a step further by developing a new, inexpensive method to identify, locate and characterize submerged sites. We collected undisturbed paleosol cores from exposed areas as well as under a few meters of sand, using a newly developed water-jet core sampling system. The cores were analyzed using micro-geoarchaeological techniques initially developed on terrestrial sites. The rationale behind this methodology is based on established knowledge that where human settlements occur, sediments are enriched by specific mineralogical signatures (e.g., heated clay minerals) and anthropogenic micro-remain assemblages (e.g., phytoliths, ash pseudomorphs and dung spherulites). Additionally, micromorphology can assist in identifying micro-stratigraphic patterns typical of human settlements. We tested sediment cores in three underwater contexts: a) exposed prehistoric surfaces within two known Neolithic sites (Atlit-Yam and Neve Yam), b) exposed paleosols without visible archaeological remains (serving as a control), and c) as a blind test, a buried paleosol currently covered by 1–3 m of sand, where the existence of a site is unknown. In the cores taken from the exposed Neolithic settlements, the micro-geoarchaeological characterization showed clear anthropogenic signals (typical mineralogy, elevated micro-remain concentrations, micro-stratigraphy). In the paleosol control cores, there was an absence (or negligible presence) of anthropogenic signals. The ‘blind test’ at the sand-covered locality revealed sediments without anthropogenic enrichments (similar to the control paleosols), thus suggesting the absence of a submerged settlement in this specific location. The new method is time- and cost-effective and can easily be applied worldwide along the shallow continental shelf as well as in deep water. The new method will facilitate discovery of new underwater sites and provide selection criteria (e.g., where the highest anthropogenic signal exists) for investment in underwater excavations. Additionally, it can be used to check for anthropogenic signals in buried locations detected by remote sensing, and to understand the spatial organization of submerged sites.","Manual coring,Neolithic Carmel coast,Micro-geoarchaeology,Submerged prehistory,Underwater archaeology,Water-jet coring,"
"detection of ais messages falsifications and spoofing by checking messages compliance with tdma protocol","2023","Automatic identification system is a navigation aid system that allows vessels to exchange automatically positions, identity and other information. It improves the safety of the maritime traffic and helps to monitor it. However, this system can be manipulated to send falsified information and to mask illicit activities. While previous research has proposed strategies to detect these threats, none of them suggest a solution that considers the time-division multiple access (TDMA) communication protocol. In this work, the compliance of the sent messages with this protocol, specified by the system's standard, is checked for every ship to detect message falsifications. Furthermore, because the ships velocity affects TDMA protocol, a strategy based a Kalman filter is applied to track every ship and to assess the consistency of their velocity data sent. The proposed strategy was validated on real data and showed very promising results. Being computationally cheap, the method can be run in real time. Source codes of the method are open-source to foster research activities from both industry and academia in this field.","Automatic Identification System (AIS),Spoofing detection,TDMA protocol,Falsifications detection,Kalman filtering,"

"deep learning-powered vessel trajectory prediction for improving smart traffic services in maritime internet of things","2022","The maritime Internet of Things (IoT) has recently emerged as a revolutionary communication paradigm where a large number of moving vessels are closely interconnected in intelligent maritime networks. However, the tremendous growth of vessel trajectories, collected from the combined satellite-terrestrial AIS (automatic identification system) base stations, could lead to unsatisfactory maritime safety and efficacy. To promote smart traffic services in maritime IoT, it is necessary to accurately and robustly predict the spatiotemporal vessel trajectories. It is beneficial for collision avoidance, maritime surveillance, and abnormal behavior detection, etc. Motivated by the strong learning capacity of deep neural networks, this work proposes an AIS data-driven trajectory prediction framework, whose main component is a long short term memory (LSTM) network. In particular, the vessel traffic conflict situation modeling, generated using the dynamic AIS data and social force concept, is embedded into the LSTM network to guarantee high-accuracy vessel trajectory prediction. In addition, a mixed loss function is reconstructed to make our prediction results more reliable and robust in different navigation environments. Several quantitative and qualitative experiments have been implemented on realistic AIS-based vessel trajectories.

"a data mining method to extract traffic network for maritime transport management","2023","Maritime traffic network is essential for navigation efficiency and safety of the maritime transport system. This study proposes a framework for extracting maritime traffic network based on Automatic Identification System (AIS) data. The framework consists of maritime traffic pattern recognition, semantic routes extraction, route decomposition, and network generation. Firstly, a data-driven method is introduced to recognize ship behavior patterns and extends the single ship behaviors to regional characteristics to determine the departure-arrival areas. Then, based on the different combination of departure-arrival areas, the ship trajectories are classified to traffic groups. Subsequently, the grid-system is used to rasterize each traffic group, which realizes the fusion of trajectory data and geographic location information. Finally, to obtain the main routes and navigation channels, the extraction method is introduced by establishing the cumulative grid importance function. The main routes, together with the navigation channels, compose the maritime traffic network. The method is applied to AIS data in the Beibu Gulf, and the results show that the traffic network contains 12 stop areas, 4 entry/exit locations, 13 main routes as well as their corresponding navigation channels. It is therefore concluded that the proposed method helps (1) provide a theoretical framework to obtain and analyze the maritime traffic network and (2) enrich navigation channel identification methods for maritime transport management.","Maritime traffic network,Maritime transport management,AIS,Machine learning,Big data analytics,"
"unambiguous imaging for moving targets in maritime scenarios with dual receive channel mode of gf-3 satellite","2019","Gaofen-3 (GF-3) is the first Chinese multichannel synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensor that can operate in the dual receive channel (DRC) mode. Different from the traditional single-channel SAR system, the multichannel SAR system can overcome the inherent limitation to achieve high-resolution and wide-swath (HRWS) at the same time. However, the key challenge it faces is false target suppression. Especially for the moving vessels on the ocean, the existence of false targets will increase false alarm probability and affect the interpretation of SAR images. In this paper, the method of integration of detection, velocity estimation, location, and imaging for moving targets in the HRWS SAR system is proposed as well as applied to get an unambiguous image. The simulation and GF-3 real data experimental results show the validity of the method.","marine radar,moving targets,image resolution,SAR images,unambiguous imaging,geophysical image processing,maritime scenarios,unambiguous image,multichannel SAR system,moving vessels,GF-3 Satellite,Unambiguous imaging,false targets,object detection,false alarm probability,synthetic aperture radar,Chinese multichannel synthetic aperture radar sensor,Dual Receive Channel Mode,radar imaging,dual receive channel mode,radar receivers,wide-swath,probability,HRWS SAR system,traditional single-channel SAR system,gaofen-3,inherent limitation,remote sensing by radar,false target suppression,oceanographic techniques,"
"permeability and voids influence on the thermal signal, as inferred by multitemporal uav-based infrared and visible images","2020","This work presents for the first time associated thermal anomalies and deformations over subsurface cavities/voids located within two harbour quays in Le Havre Harbourg, Normandy, France. An U.A.V. (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) was used to acquire visible and thermal images over a diurnal cycle (from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m.). The visible images were processed to realize an altimetric model of the platforms by mean of the photogrammetric method, while the thermal infrared (TIR) images were used to study the evolution of their surface temperatures. The obtained 3D model shows the location of five topographic depressions on both quays. The analysis of the evolution of the surface thermal field leads to the detection of cold thermal anomalies that are (1) not correlated to surface properties, and (2) spatially associated to the flanks of the five topographic depressions. Using a 2D conductive-radiative model, we show that these anomalies are not directly due to the thermally insulating effect of an air-filled area. Finally, we conclude that preferential infiltration and subsequent evaporation in the micro-fracturation present within the flanks of the depressions may be responsible for the strong cooling of these zones.","Thermal infrared,Photogrammetry,Remote Sensing,infiltration,Subsurface cavity,Natural hazards,UAV,"

"arduino based maritime border alert system for fisherman","2022","Fishermenâ€™s livelihoods are so insecure that if they cross the countryâ€™s border accidently, it is treated as a serious offence. The severity of the situation seems to worsen when impoverished fisherman are shot and their boats are taken. The fundamental cause of this problem is that marine borders between countries are difficult to identify. The term â€œmaritime border alert systemâ€ refers to a system that assists fishermen by informing them of the countryâ€™s border while protecting them and their boats. Technology such as global navigation satellite system, universal mobile telecommunications network and ultrasonic sensors are used to achieve this purpose. The proposed framework includes a low-cost maritime boundary crossing warning system for fishermen.","warning system,LCD,Telecommunications,Arduino Uno,passive radar,Sensor systems,3G mobile communication,low-cost maritime boundary,impoverished fisherman,ultrasonic sensor,ships,marine safety,satellite navigation,boats,fishermen,term maritime border alert system,country,fundamental cause,Alarm systems,Acoustics,serious offence,signal detection,Boats,global navigation satellite system,marine communication,Sensors,Global positioning system,marine borders,Global navigation satellite system,oceanographic techniques,"
"directional wave climate and power variability along the southeast australian shelf","2015","Variability in the modal wave climate is a key process driving large-scale coastal behaviour on moderate- to high-energy sandy coastlines, and is strongly related to variability in synoptic climate drivers. On sub-tropical coasts, shifts in the sub-tropical ridge (STR) modulate the seasonal occurrence of different wave types. However, in semi-enclosed seas, isolating directional wave climates and synoptic drivers is hindered by a complex mixed sea-swell environment. Here we present a directional wave climate typology for the Tasman Sea based on a combined statistical-synoptic approach using mid-shelf wave buoy observations along the Southeast Australian Shelf (SEAS). Five synoptic-scale wave climates exist during winter, and six during summer. These can be clustered into easterly (Tradewind), south-easterly (Tasman Sea) and southerly (Southern Ocean) wave types, each with distinct wave power signatures. We show that a southerly shift in the STR and trade-wind zone, consistent with an observed poleward expansion of the tropics, forces an increase in the total wave energy flux in winter for the central New South Wales shelf of 1.9GJm–1 wave-crest-length for 1° southerly shift in the STR, and a reduction of similar magnitude (approximately 1.8GJm–1) during summer. In both seasons there is an anti-clockwise rotation of wave power towards the east and south-east at the expense of southerly waves. Reduced obliquity of constructive wave power would promote a general disruption to northward alongshore sediment transport, with the cross-shore component becoming increasingly prevalent. Results are of global relevance to sub-tropical east coasts where the modal wave climate is influenced by the position of the zonal STR.","Wave climate,Cluster analysis,Wave power,Sub-tropical ridge,Tasman Sea,Southeast Australia,"
"security and qos issues in blockchain enabled next-generation smart logistic networks: a tutorial","2022","The blockchain-enabled smart logistics market is expected to grow worth USD 1620 billion and at a compound annual growth rate of 62.4%. Smart logistics ensures intelligence infrastructure, logistics automation, real-time analysis of supply chain data synchronization of the logistics process, cost transparency, unbroken shipment tracking all the way down to the transportation route, etc. In the smart logistics domain, significant advancement and growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) sensors are evident. However, the connectivity of IoT systems, including Tactile Internet, without proper safeguards creates vulnerabilities that can still be deliberately or inadvertently cause disruption. In view of this, we primarily notice two key issues. Firstly, the logistics domain can be compromised by a variety of natural or man-made activities, which eventually affect the overall network security. Secondly, there are thousands of entities in the supply chain network that use extensive machine-learning algorithms in many scenarios, and they require high-power computational resources. From these two challenges, we note that the first concern can be addressed by adding blockchain to IoT logistic networks. The second issue can be addressed using 6G. This will support 1-μs latency communications, support seamless computing at the edges of networks, and autonomously predict the best optimal location for edge computing. Motivated by this, we have highlighted motivational examples to show the necessity to integrate 6G and blockchain in smart logistic networks. Then, we have proposed a 6G and blockchain-enabled smart logistic high-level framework. We have presented the key intrinsic issues of this framework mainly from the security and resource management context. In this paper, recent state-of-the-art advances in blockchain enabled next-generation smart logistic networks are analyzed. We have also examined why 6G and not 5G would be compatible with the smart network. We have introduced five different use cases of blockchain technology in smart logistics. Later, this paper discusses some important concerns that blockchain in smart logistics might face. We have also provided potential solutions to tackle these concerns.","Smart logistics,Blockchain,6G,Internet of Things,Security,5G,"
"real-time infrared horizon detection in maritime and land environments based on hyper-laplace filter and convolutional neural network","2023","The infrared (IR) horizon is an essential reference for near-ground state awareness and target detection. The traditional horizon detection algorithms based on hand-crafted features claim the advantage of being intuitive and highly targeted, however, their capability of detail extraction and robustness is not strong enough when switching among diverse scenes, meanwhile, the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have the powerful ability in feature acquisition, but has the disadvantages of interpretability and instability. Given this, this article proposes a novel horizon detection algorithm that combines the traditional method and CNN. First, the hyper-Laplace filter (HLF) is proposed to eliminate the interferences and enhance the saliency of the target. Then a positioning module (PM) based on the traditional idea which fully utilizes the structural characteristics of multifeature-maps in CNN is present to extract the endpoints of the horizon. Finally, an auxiliary module that consists of a revise branch (RB) and self-attention module (SAM) is designed to assist the PM with detailed corrections. Compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms, experiments based on three datasets with more than 25000 frames under various scenes demonstrate that the proposed algorithm not only achieves the best accuracy and highest stability but also addresses real-time needs. Notably, the detection deviation is controlled within 2 pixels on all three datasets while achieving a comparable detection speed of 170 frames/s. Besides, our algorithm also shows strong robustness even under harsh sea conditions and urban backgrounds.

"early 20th century warming in the arctic: a review","2011","From the 1920s to the 1940s, the Artic experienced significant warming that is comparable to the recent 30-year warming. The former warming was concentrated mostly in high latitudes, in contrast to the recent 30-year warming, which has occurred in all latitudes. Several explanations have been proposed; however, one of these proposed explanations, single external forcing, which could once explain the global average, failed to explain the early 20th century scenario. A second possible explanation was internal atmospheric variability with low frequency. Another candidate for the explanation was still forcing by black carbon deposited on snow and ice surfaces. The answer is most likely to be a combination of intrinsic internal natural climate variability and positive feedbacks that amplified the radiative and atmospheric forcing. We must continue our study by discovering historical data, analyzing ice cores, reanalyzing the Arctic system together with long-term reanalysis dating back to the 1880s, and also determine the contributions of each factor.","Early 20th century warming,Climate forcing,Internal variability,Arctic,"
"enhancing ais to improve whale-ship collision avoidance and maritime security","2009","Whale-ship strikes are of growing worldwide concern due to the steady growth of commercial shipping. Improving the current situation involves the creation of a communication capability allowing whale position information to be estimated and exchanged among vessels and other observation assets. An early example of such a system has been implemented for the shipping lane approaches to the harbor of Boston, Massachusetts where ship traffic transits areas of the Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary frequently used by whales. It uses the Automated Identification Systems (AIS) technology, currently required for larger vessels but becoming more common in all classes of vessels. However, we believe the default mode of AIS operation will be inadequate to meet the long-term needs of whale-ship collision avoidance, and will likewise fall short of meeting other current and future marine safety and security communication needs. This paper explores the emerging safety and security needs for vessel communications, and considers the consequences of a communication framework supporting asynchronous messaging that can be used to enhance the basic AIS capability. The options we analyze can be pursued within the AIS standardization process, or independently developed with attention to compatibility with existing AIS systems. Examples are discussed for minimizing ship interactions with Humpback Whales and endangered North Atlantic Right Whales on the east coast, and North Pacific Right Whales, Bowhead Whales, Humpback Whales, Blue Whales and Beluga Whales in west coast, Alaskan and Hawaiian waters.","marine accidents,North Atlantic right Whales,Whale-ship collision avoidance,Communication system security,Standardization,Marine vehicles,vessel communications,maritime security,Sea measurements,Whale position information,AIS technology,Humpback Whales,ships,marine safety,marine engineering,Collision avoidance,Oceans,Beluga Whales,Boston,automated identification systems technology,North Pacific Right Whales,Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary,Economic forecasting,AIS enhancement,Marine technology,Bowhead Whales,Marine safety,Massachusetts,collision avoidance,Blue Whales,Whales,"
"prospects and challenges in unlocking natural-gas-hydrate energy in india: recent advancements","2022","Natural gas hydrate deposits hold huge potential as a future energy resource of the world including India. To help realize these resources, India carried out two dedicated research expeditions (NGHP-01 and 02) to identify, characterize and analyze natural gas hydrate resource potential in its maritime boundaries. This work presents a review of the current status of research and development activities in the area of natural gas hydrate systems in India taking a cue from the NGHP-02 research findings. The NGHP-02 is considered one of the most extensive research programs to date for drilling and pressure core collection. This program resulted in minimally disturbed and well-preserved core samples collected from pressure-coring. Logging while drilling, wireline logging, formation pressure testing, vertical seismic profiling, and pressure core analysis confirmed one of the highly saturated (~40%–100%), sand-based, hydrate accumulation in three ultradeep locations, Area B, C, and E, eastern offshore India. The shipborne evaluation helped in the collection of the most suitable core samples to perform the first-ever comprehensive post-cruise triaxial testing, to obtain key petrophysical and geomechanical properties of interest. Further, a suitably designed experimental strategy helped to collect multiple sets of data from utilizing a lesser number of pressure core samples. The most prominent experiments included drained-undrained consolidation and compression, multistage compression and consolidation, alternating strain-rate compression, and permeability evaluation tests. The seal overlying hydrate layer are primarily made of clay rich sediments. The permeability measurements findings of the tested samples were reported in the range of 0.01 to tens of mD depending upon hydrate saturation, sand particle distribution, and range of applied effective stress. Significant permeability loss (∼90%) with increasing effective stress (up to 10 MPa) was noted. Further, permeability anisotropy, a ratio of horizontal to vertical permeability = 4, is reported to be consistent with the values reported for other marine hydrate-bearing sediments. The geochemical analysis put the natural gas to be primarily composed of methane mostly from microbial sources however part contribution from deeper sources was not ruled out. Moreover, numerical modeling of sand migration, thermal characterization, hydrate morphology, and extensive reservoir simulations was also used to obtain greater insight into the nature of the hydrate deposition system and its resource potential. Hydrate occurrences in an ultradeep and shallow subseafloor environment, such as those found in the Krishna-Godavari basin, pose challenge to well bore stability and sustained gas production due to the combined effect of high-pressure drawdown and hydrate dissociation induced strength loss and sand migration. Hence, incorporation of a coupled flow, geomechanical and sand migration analysis in well bore stability and reservoir simulation are suggested as a way forward. The NGHP-02 program and its findings not only advance India's endeavor to locally produce natural gas from these unconventional resources but also provides valuable information concerning exploitation of other marine gas hydrate accumulations found elsewhere in the world.","Gas hydrate reservoir,Logging while drilling,Seismic profile,Pressure core,Reservoir simulation,Geomechanical properties,Krishna-Godavari basin,"

"operational active fire mapping and burnt area identification applicable to mexican nature protection areas using modis and noaa-avhrr direct readout data","2009","Since 1999, the National Commission for the Knowledge and Use of the Biodiversity (CONABIO) in Mexico has been developing and managing the “Operational program for the detection of hot-spots using remote sensing techniques”. This program uses images from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard the Terra and Aqua satellites and from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA-AVHRR), which are operationally received through the Direct Readout station (DR) at CONABIO. This allows the near-real time monitoring of fire events in Mexico and Central America. In addition to the detection of active fires, the location of hot spots are classified with respect to vegetation types, accessibility, and risk to Nature Protection Areas (NPA). Besides the fast detection of fires, further analysis is necessary due to the considerable effects of forest fires on biodiversity and human life. This fire impact assessment is crucial to support the needs of resource managers and policy makers for adequate fire recovery and restoration actions. CONABIO attempts to meet these requirements, providing post-fire assessment products as part of the management system in particular for satellite-based burnt area mapping. This paper provides an overview of the main components of the operational system and will present an outlook to future activities and system improvements, especially the development of a burnt area product.

"“mystify”: a proactive moving-target defense for a resilient sdn controller in software defined cps","2022","The recent devastating mission Cyber–Physical System (CPS) attacks, failures, and the desperate need to scale and to dynamically adapt to changes, revolutionized traditional CPS to what we name as Software Defined CPS (SD-CPS). SD-CPS embraces the concept of Software Defined (SD) everything where CPS infrastructure is more elastic, dynamically adaptable and online-programmable. However, in SD-CPS, the threat became more immanent, as the long-been physically-protected assets are now programmatically accessible to cyber attackers. In SD-CPSs, a network failure hinders the entire functionality of the system. In this paper, we present MystifY, a spatiotemporal runtime diversification for Moving-Target Defense (MTD) to secure the SD-CPS infrastructure. In this paper, we relied on Smart Grid networks as crucial SD-CPS application to evaluate our presented solution. MystifY’s MTD relies on a set of pillars to ensure the SDN controller resiliency against failures and attacks. The 1st pillar is a grid-aware algorithm that optimally allocates the most suitable controller–deployment​ location in large-scale grids. The 2nd pillar is a special diversifier that dynamically relocates the controller between heterogeneously configured hosts to avoid host-based attacks. The 3rd pillar is a temporal diversifier that dynamically detours controller–workload between multiple controllers to enhance their reliability and to detect and avoid controller intrusions.

"one-dimensional spectral analysis of aeromagnetic data from temiscouata area and the western sector of the gulf of st. lawrence","1979","1-D spectral analysis is useful to determine the mean depths to buried magnetic Precambrian basement rocks. The average thickness of the sedimentary cover which may contain favourable petroleum reservoirs overlying the basement of the Northern Appalachians of Quebec was determined by this method. Additional information related to structural geology of the basement and the sedimentary cover can also be obtained with this technique. The center of the Temiscouata area is located at longitude 69° W and latitude 47° 45′ N and the one of the Gulf at 67° 45′ W and 49° 05′ N. The aeromagnetic data were digitized from the 1 mile = 1 inch total field contour maps published by EMR. In the digitization process, the magnetic intensities were read on contour lines only. Interpolation at fixed intervals were calculated with the help of a computer program subroutine. The fixed intervals were chosen at 0.25, 0.50 on shore and 1.00 mile offshore in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. The magnetic gradient was removed using the IGRF formula or numerical filters. The least square method was avoided because of the biasing it involves. Additional smoothing was occasionally done. After these different steps were executed, the transformation to obtain the Fourier co-efficients was carried out using an algorithm for computing the Mixed Radix Fast Fourier Transform. Mean depths are then calculated from the energy spectra; this constitutes a statistical approach. The mean depths obtained from the 1-D energy spectrum are comparable within 10–15% with the ones obtained from the 2-D energy spectrum. 1-D spectral analysis of AM data offers some advantages on the 2-D counterpart. Among these, we can mention the eventuality of obtaining mean depths to the basement from the analysis of only a few AM flight lines in a new area and of detailing more accurately structural features of local nature in the basement. Such structural features may be controlling agents in eventual reservoirs within the sedimentary rocks.",""
"response strategies of the main forest types to climatic anomalies across croatian biogeographic regions inferred from fapar remote sensing data","2014","Croatia is positioned in the transitional zone of South-eastern Europe and the Mediterranean, a region with frequent occurrence of severe droughts and dry spells, which makes it particularly vulnerable to the impact of climate change. It distends across three main European biogeographical regions – Continental, Alpine and Mediterranean – and therefore has a very high level of forest diversity comprised of 11 out of 14 European forest types. This makes it very convenient to study the exposure of main European forest types to extreme climatic events in the southern limits of their species distribution range. This study provides an assessment of responses of forest vegetation under episodes of climatic anomalies consisting of the most severe historical dry and warm spells in 2000 and 2003, together with the extremely rainy season in 2005 across Croatian territory. The question of interest in this study was to reveal how the existing forest types across the territorial gradient respond to highly expressed extreme climatic variations and to infer some clues about related adaptive strategies. The regional scale approach was applied which previously performed structural delineation of forest cover into eleven main forest groups or bioclimates and were examined considering functional differences. Responses of eleven bioclimatic types were analyzed by time series (1998–2005) of monthly FAPAR (The Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetic Active Radiation) coverage with a spatial resolution of 1.2km, freely available from JRC FAPAR project. To quantify and differentiate the vegetation response in the considered years we adopted indices of resilience (resistance, recovery, resilience and relative resilience). We also provided a modified approach by applying these indices on a seasonal scale to examine the relationship between variations of phenology and ecosystem responses. The results confirmed the modification of seasonality of photosynthetic activity in relation to the altitudinal and spatial gradient. At the intra-seasonal scale, we distinguished specific opportunistic behavior of the common beech and oak forest types to alternating climatic conditions. Beech forest types show a very high ability to shift their phenology to earlier spring warming as a consequence of global warming. However, continental and Mediterranean oak forest types and in particular Aleppo pine and holm oak forests showed a higher increase of FAPAR during rainy events. The revealed capability of some tree species to better exploit rainfall in very wet periodic episodes has to be further evaluated in drawing conclusions about the overall resilience of forests under future climate change scenarios.","Extreme climatic events,Forest resilience,Climate change impacts,Land surface phenology,Forest responses,Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR),"
"hourly composition of gas and particle phase pollutants at a central urban background site in milan, italy","2017","A comprehensive range of gas and particle phase pollutants were sampled at 1-hour time resolution in urban background Milan during summer 2012. Measurements include several soluble inorganic aerosols (Cl−,NO2−,NO3−,SO42−,Ca2+,K+,Mg2+,Na+,NH4+) and gases (HCl, HNO2,HNO3, NH3, NO, NO2,O3, SO2), organic, elemental and black carbon and meteorological parameters. Analysis methods used include mean diurnal pattern on weekdays and Sundays, pollution roses, bivariate polar plots and statistical models using backtrajectories. Results show how nitrous acid (HONO) was mainly formed heterogeneously at nighttime, with a dependence of its formation rate on NO2 consistent with observations during the last HONO campaign in Milan in summer 1998, although since 1998 a drop in HONO levels occurred following to the decrease of its precursors. Nitrate showed two main formation mechanisms: one occurring through N2O5 at nighttime and leading to nitrate formation onto existing particles; another occurring both daytime and nighttime following the homogeneous reaction of ammonia gas with nitric acid gas. Air masses reaching Milan influenced nitrate formation depending on their content in ammonia and the timing of arrival. Notwithstanding the low level of SO2 in Milan, its peaks were associated to point source emissions in the Po valley or shipping and power plant emissions SW of Milan, beyond the Apennines. A distinctive pattern for HCl was observed, featured by an afternoon peak and a morning minimum, and best correlated to atmospheric temperature, although it was not possible to identify any specific source. The ratio of primary-dominated organic carbon and elemental carbon on hourly PM2.5 resulted 1.7. Black carbon was highly correlated to elemental carbon and the average mass absorption coefficient resulted MAC=13.8 ± 0.2 m2 g−1. It is noteworthy how air quality for a large metropolitan area, in a confined valley and under enduring atmospheric stability, is nonetheless influenced by sources within and outside the valley.","Gas-phase pollutants,Po valley,PM,Hourly ionic composition,"
"variability and propagation of labrador sea water in the southern subpolar north atlantic","2009","The variability of two modes of Labrador Sea Water (LSW) (upper and deep Labrador Sea Water) and their respective spreading in the interior North Atlantic Ocean are investigated by means of repeated ship surveys carried out along the zonal WOCE line A2/AR19 located at 43–48°N (1993–2007) and along the GOOS line at about 48–51°N (1997–2002). Hydrographic section data are complemented by temperature, salinity, and velocity time series recorded by two moorings. They have been deployed at the western flank of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR) in the Newfoundland Basin during 1996–2004. The analysis of hydrographic anomalies at various longitudes points to a gradual eastward propagation of LSW-related signals, which happens on time scales of 3–6 years from the formation region towards the MAR. Interactions of the North Atlantic Current (NAC) with the Deep Western Boundary Current (DWBC) close to Flemish Cap point to the NAC being the main distributor of the different types of LSW into the interior of the Newfoundland Basin. Comparisons between the ship data and the mooring records revealed that the mooring sites are located in a region affected by highly variable flow. The mooring time series demonstrate an elevated level of variability with eddy activity and variability associated with the NAC considerably influencing the LSW signals in this region. Hydrographic data taken from Argo profiles from the vicinity of the mooring sites turned out to mimic quite well the temporal evolution captured by the moorings. There is some indication of occasional southward flow in the LSW layer near the MAR. If this can be considered as a hint to an interior LSW-route, it is at least of minor importance in comparison to the DWBC.

It influences almost all successive operations, including storage position allocation for individual container, equipment scheduling, stowage planning and container relocation, etc. This paper studies storage space pre-allocation for outbound containers of arriving ships. Considering the complexity influence of random factors and the coupling relations with other subsystems, rules are collected from the real container terminals and are described in the form of constraint. The decision-making frame with mathematics model and system simulation is proposed, in which mathematics expresses are defined for clearing up objectives, variables and influencing factors of the storage plan problem, and simulation scenarios with the random factors considered are built and run to verify the mathematics model.

"mobility pattern analysis of ship trajectories based on semantic transformation and topic model","2020","Recognition and understanding of ship mobility pattern have great significance for intelligent maritime applications, i.e. route discovery and anomaly detection. Besides a number of pattern discovery techniques currently derived from ship trajectory, topic modeling popular in the field of Natural Language Processing may provide a novel way to detect implicit patters underlying massive ship trajectories treated as documents. This paper is motivated to apply a semantic analysis method to explore potential mobility patterns from ship trajectories in inland river by combining semantic transformation and topic model. A coarse-grained semantic transformation model is firstly defined to translate each ship trajectory into a document containing a series of sequential motion words. A motion word is generally a synthetic semantic representation of three trajectory features (location, course and speed). All ship trajectories can then be examined and analyzed as a document corpus. A classic topic model (i.e. Latent Dirichlet Allocation, LDA) is employed to explore hidden ship mobility patterns from trajectory document corpus. The effectiveness of this approach is illustrated through a case study at Wuhan waterway, located at middle stream of Yangtze River in China.","Ship mobility pattern,Trajectory analysis,Topic modeling,Automatic identification system,"
"effective and efficient pixel-level detection for diverse video copy-move forgery types","2022","Video copy-move forgery detection (VCMFD) is a significant and greatly challenging task due to a variety of difficulties, including a huge amount of video information, diverse forgery types, rich forgery objects, and homogenous forgery sources. These difficulties raise four unresolved key challenges in VCMFD: i) ineffective detection in some popular forgery cases; ii) inefficient matching in processing numerous video pixels with hundred-dimensional features under dozens of matching iterations; iii) high false positive (FP) in detecting forgery videos; iv) low trade-off of efficiency and effectiveness in filling forgery region, and even failing in indicating forgeries at the pixel level. In this paper, a novel VCMFD method is proposed to address these issues: i) an innovatively improved SIFT structure that can address the thorough feature extraction in all video copy-move forgery cases; ii) a novel fast keypoint-label matching (FKLM) algorithm is proposed that creates some keypoint-label groups so that every high-dimensional feature is assigned into one of these groups. As a result, matching of video pixels can be directly done on a small number of keypoint-label groups only, leading to a nearly 500% raise in matching efficiency; iii) a new coarse-to-fine filtering relying on intrinsic attributes of exact keypoint-matches is designed to more effectively reduce the false keypoint-matches; iv) the adaptive block filling relying on true keypoint-matches contributes to the accurate and efficient suspicious region filling, even at the pixel level. Finally, the suspicious region locations with the forgery vision persistence concept indicate forgery videos. Compared to the state-of-art methods, the experiments show that our proposed method achieves the best detection accuracy, lowest FP, and improved at least 16% and 8% of F1 scores on the GRIP 2.0 dataset and a combination of SULFA 2.0 & REWIND datasets. Furthermore, the proposed method is with low computational time (4.45 s/Mpixels), which is about 1/2-1/3 times of the latest DFMI-BM (8.02 s/Mpixels) and PM-2D (13.1 s/Mpixels) methods.","Video copy-move forgery detection,Fast keypoint-label matching,Adaptive block filling,Thorough feature extraction,Coarse-to-fine filtering,"
"environmental impact of disposal of coal mining wastes on soils and plants in rostov oblast, russia","2018","Underground coal mining in Southern European Russia leads to soil cover destruction in areas directly occupied by spoil tips and rock dumps located nearby. Coal producing areas in Rostov Oblast were selected for a detailed consideration. Soil samples were taken from the uppermost horizons: a layer of 0–10cm of spoil tips and surrounding areas, as well as from 1.5m depth vertical soil profiles. The soil samples were analysed for mineral composition, particle-size distribution and gross contents of Cu, Zn, Pb, Ag, Sn, Mo, Ba, Co, Ni, Mn, Ti, V, Cr, Ga, P, Li, Sr, Y, Yb, Nb, Sc and Zr, using emission spectral analysis. The plant species of mining influenced areas were described. The process of Technosol formation at the waste sites was considered separately. Soils have not yet formed as a result of a self-restoration on the spoil tips aged more than 50years and burnt-out decades ago. A vegetation cover, which emerged during this time range, practically does not support the progress of any considerable soil-forming process. The ponds formed by the flooding of burning spoil tips, do not give the possibility for the formation of soils and hardly contribute to plant growth. The surface layers of spoil tips at all stages of their development are different from the surrounding steppe soils in geochemical characteristics and mineralogical composition. The atmospheric and water inflow of material from spoil tips changes (in the cases studied - worsens) a state of steppe soils within a radius of 1 km, and leads to the increase of heavy metal content in these soils.","Geochemical impact assessment,Heavy metals,Technogenic anomalies,Soil pollution,"
"malicious ais spoofing and abnormal stealth deviations: a comprehensive statistical framework for maritime anomaly detection","2021","The automatic identification system (AIS) is an essential and economical equipment for collision avoidance and maritime surveillance. However, AIS can be subject to intentional reporting of false information, or â€œspoofingâ€. This article assumes the vessel trajectory nominally follows a piecewise mean-reverting process; thereby, it addresses the problem of establishing whether a vessel is reporting adulterated position information through AIS messages in order to hide its current planned route and a possible deviation from the nominal route. Multiple hypothesis testing suggests a framework to enlist reliable information from monitoring systems (coastal radars and space-born satellite sensors) in support of detection of anomalies, spoofing, and stealth deviations. The proposed solution involves the derivation of anomaly detection rules based on the generalized likelihood ratio test and the model-order selection methodologies. The effectiveness of the proposed anomaly detection strategy is tested for different case studies within an operational scenario with simulated data.","Ornsteinâ€“Uhlenbeck (OU) process,surveillance,maximum likelihood estimation,generalized likelihood ratio test,Automatic identification system (AIS),model-order selection (MOS),monitoring systems,AIS messages,security of data,maritime security,maritime situational awareness,target tracking,statistical analysis,vessel trajectory,model-order selection methodologies,Testing,automatic identification system,marine engineering,maritime surveillance,Data models,data spoofing,abnormal stealth deviations,Radar tracking,multiple hypothesis testing,Artificial intelligence,maritime anomaly detection,coastal radars,Radar,statistical framework,piecewise mean-reverting process,Trajectory,multiple statistical hypothesis test,space-born satellite sensors,Surveillance,collision avoidance,malicious AIS spoofing,"
"observation needs for climate information, prediction and application: capabilities of existing and future observing systems","2010","The demand for long-term, sustained, reliable data and derived information on climate and its changes has never been greater than today. Long-term, well-calibrated, global observations of Essential Climate Variables (ECV) such as air temperature, precipitation, and sea-surface temperature are critical for defining the evolving state of the Earth's climate. Observing systems routinely collect much of the required data covering 49 ECVs, and significant progress has been made in coverage and technological capability over the two decades since the Second World Climate Conference. However, many key regions and climatic zones remain poorly observed, and gaps are widening in some cases. Supporting infrastructures for data stewardship and analysis are largely in place but require strengthening, while those for linking with socio-economic data and for providing user-oriented information services require more substantial development. The current capabilities are summarized, and further actions are identified to ensure that climate observation activities more fully meet the needs of science and society. The Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) was established in 1992 with the goal of providing comprehensive information on the total climate system, involving a multidisciplinary range of physical, chemical and biological observations of the atmosphere, oceans and land. GCOS is a “system of systems” that builds on the climate-relevant components of existing observing systems, and relies almost entirely upon national efforts to maintain and enhance those systems. Contributing systems include the World Meteorological Organization Global Observing System (GOS) for meteorology, its Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW) for atmospheric composition, the Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS), led by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC), and the Global Terrestrial Observing System (GTOS), led by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). GCOS itself is the climate observing system within the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) developed under the auspices of the Group on Earth Observations (GEO). The established in situ networks and space-based components must be sustained and operated with ongoing attention to data quality in accordance with the GCOS Climate Monitoring Principles; enhancements must be made for some types of observations; the exchange of observations and delivery of data and information to users must be ensured; reprocessing and reanalysis must be strengthened; and national and international coordination must be improved. The consequence of not meeting these requirements would be to seriously compromise the information on, and predictions of, climate variability and change. Detailed information on GCOS and the datasets that are produced as a result of GCOS observing activities can be found at the Global Observing Systems Information Center (GOSIC) at http://gosic.org.","GEOSS,climate observations,GEO,ECV,GAW,GTOS,GOOS,essential climate variables,GCOS,"
"maritime traffic networks: from historical positioning data to unsupervised maritime traffic monitoring","2018","The large maritime traffic volume and its implications in economy, environment, safety, and security require an unsupervised system to monitor maritime traffic. In this paper, a method is proposed to automatically produce synthetic maritime traffic representations from historical self-reporting positioning data, more specifically from automatic identification system data. The method builds a two-layer network that represents the maritime traffic in the monitored area, where the external layer presents the network's basic structure and the inner layer provides precision and granularity to the representation. The method is tested in a specific scenario with high traffic density, the Baltic Sea. Experimental results reveal a decrease of over 99% storage data with a negligible precision drop. Finally, the novel method presents a light and structured representation of the maritime traffic, which sets the foundations to real-time automatic maritime traffic monitoring, anomaly detection, and situation prediction.","two-layer network,automatic identification system data,anomaly detection,traffic monitoring,synthetic maritime traffic representations,unsupervised maritime traffic monitoring,statistical analysis,real-time automatic maritime traffic monitoring,situation prediction,ships,marine engineering,maritime surveillance,AIS,Artificial intelligence,high traffic density,maritime traffic networks,Sensors,traffic engineering computing,Navigation,Surveillance,Baltic Sea,Data mining,Maritime traffic representation,Security,self-reporting positioning data,"
"results from 3 seasons of surveys in maritime canada using the leica chiroptera ii shallow water topo-bathymetric lidar sensor","2017","The coastal zone is a challenging place to map, techniques for mapping the land cover and elevation do not work under water and methods for mapping the seabed cover and elevation work well in deep water but are dangerous and expensive in shallow water. As a result, detailed information in the shallow coastal zone is lacking. This presentation will focus on the Chiroptera II, a new shallow water topo-bathymetric lidar sensor that is designed to collect seamless elevation data from land to the submerged terrain under coastal or freshwater. The sensor is equipped with a 1064 nm laser capable of a laser scanning frequency up to 500 kHz and a 515 nm green laser capable of a scanning frequency of 35 kHz. The lasers pulses are directed to the surface using a palmer scanner that results in an elliptical scan pattern with a 14 degree forward and back scan angle and a 20 degree left and right scan angle. The NIR laser is used to map details on the land and to assist in defining the water surface, which is critical in order to compensate for the 515 nm laser beam diffraction angle and the change of speed from air to water, thus accurately positioning the reflected seabed return. In addition to collecting the elevation at high resolution ~ 1m and vertical precision ~ 15 cm, the intensity of the reflected green laser also provides insights into what is on the seabed. A 60 MPIX RCD30 camera capable of capturing NIR and RGB bands of imagery is co-aligned with the lidar sensor to provide additional data that can be directly georeferenced with a ca 5 cm resolution. Full waveforms of the green laser are recorded and used to calculate discrete points representing the water surface, objects in the water column and the seabed bathymetry. Standard point attributes include the x, y, z positioning, echo information and intensity or amplitude of the reflected signal. An empirical method has been developed to compensate for the exponential energy loss of the green laser energy with water depth. This method results in a â€œdepth normalizedâ€ seabed intensity image which provides details on the seabed cover materials. Tools have been built to calculate waveform metrics of the seabed return including: total area under the curve, skewness, kurtosis, the left and right distance and angle to the peak. These waveform metrics can then be used to construct grids representing the metrics which can be used for subsequent bottom cover classification. NSCC-AGRG has conducted topo-bathy lidar surveys throughout Maritime Canada for the past 3 years using this sensor. Since the sensor relies on the penetration of 515 nm light to detect the seabed, water clarity and the reflectivity of the seabed are constraints on the depth of penetration of the lidar. Coastal waters have variable turbidity, often dominated by wind induced wave action that suspends near shore sediments causing poor survey conditions. A turbidity management system has been designed that relies on meteorological forecasts and observed wind conditions as well as shoreline orientation along the coast to predict suitable periods for bathymetric lidar surveys. The turbidity management system will be presented as well as the results of several surveys. Various applications of these data will be presented including mapping submerged aquatic vegetation, providing input to hydrodynamic model simulations to support aquaculture site selection and improve oil spill preparedness, and shoreline sensitivity mapping. In areas of repeat surveys, the sensor has demonstrated the capability of mapping subtle changes in the dynamic near shore environment.","seagrass,wavelength 1064.0 nm,aquaculture site selection,wavelength 515.0 nm,near shore sediments,turbidity management system,Surface waves,water clarity,Sea measurements,shoreline sensitivity mapping,Leica Chiroptera II shallow water topobathymetric lidar sensor,Laser radar,geophysical image processing,Surface emitting lasers,seabed cover materials,topo-bathymetric lidar,frequency 500.0 kHz,water column,NSCC-AGRG,circulation model,laser scanning frequency,remote sensing by laser beam,land cover,green laser energy,laser beam diffraction angle,coastal waters,oil spill preparedness,map details,optical radar,bathymetry,aquatic vegetation mapping,freshwater,near shore environment,bottom mapping,vegetation,NIR laser,MPIX RCD30 camera,maritime Canada,bathymetric lidar surveys,depth normalized seabed intensity image,bottom reflectance,frequency 35.0 kHz,shallow coastal zone,lasers pulses,Vegetation mapping,palmer scanner,sediments,aquaculture,Reflectivity,"

"systems evaluation for defense operations of maritime transport","2020","Mobility of personnel and cargo, such as maritime transport, is subject to safety and security risks within a system corridor. Maritime transport has a critical role in the global economy but is subject to intentional attacks and site-specific risks. Decision-makers are informed by quantitative and qualitive factors in the prioritization of corridor risks through multi-objective criteria analysis. Previously, corridor analysis has been accomplished with innovative straight-line diagrams for land transportation but can be extended to evaluate disorganized corridors such as waterways. Attacks can originate from aerial, submerged, and surface origins with unique security risks associated with waterway channel geometry. A prioritization framework is required for defense operations of maritime transport, which is achieved through a multi-factor security and safety corridor analysis. The analysis classifies corridor locations into critical locations to inform operators.

"instantaneous global navigation satellite system (gnss)-based attitude determination for maritime applications","2012","Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) is a valuable technology for a large number of maritime applications. Other than providing the absolute positioning service, it aids many demanding applications, such as precise docking, formation of surface craft, autonomous vehicles, sinkage monitoring, etc. GNSS carrier-phase-based algorithms provide high-precision positioning solutions, but an integer number of cycles inherent to the observed signal have to be resolved. A newly developed GNSS carrier-phase ambiguity resolution method is tested. The new method solves for the unknown number of integer cycles by exploiting the known placement of the GNSS antennas aboard the vessel. The a priori information on the antennas baseline separation is employed as a hard constraint. A simplified (linearized) version of the method, suitable for large vessels, is also analyzed. The new method was tested against the most challenging scenario when processing GNSS data: single-frequency, single-epoch, unaided ambiguity resolution. Through different tests, the high performance of the new method is demonstrated: high fixing rate, large robustness, and short time-to-fix after initialization, cycle slips, and/or loss of locks. Considerations about the wide spectra of maritime applications are given, and a specific experiment is carried out to demonstrate the capabilities of the method for navigation in shallow waters.","Antennas,shipborne attitude,Position measurement,Vectors,high-precision positioning,Marine vehicles,sinkage monitoring,under-keel clearance (UKC),instantaneous global navigation satellite system,satellite navigation,GNSS antennas,Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS),Ambiguity resolution,carrier-phase ambiguity resolution,maritime applications,Global Navigation Satellite Systems,Minimization,marine communication,attitude determination,Estimation,constrained least squares,"

"textual risk mining for maritime situational awareness","2014","In this paper, we propose an auxiliary Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) integrated system for maritime situational awareness (MSA) operations. We bring into account a new and influential asset - human intuition and perception - to the existing semi-automated decision support systems that mostly rely on numerical data collected by electronic sensors or cameras located either directly on the vessels or in the maritime command-and-control centers. For our project, we gathered weekly textual reports spanning twelve months from the United States Worldwide Threats to Shipping Reports repository that belongs to the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), We considered the maritime incident reports written by human operators as a valuable and accessible unstructured textual input source in which a span of text1 is called â€œriskâ€ if it expresses one of the following kinds of vessel incidents: fired, robbed, boarded, hijacked, attacked, chased, approached, kidnapped, boarding attempted, suspiciously approached or clashed with. Our approach benefits from probability distributions of some useful features annotated based on a list of lexicons that contain expressions denoting vessel types, risks types, risk associates, maritime geographical locations, dates and times. These distributions are captured and used to anchor the span of â€œrisksâ€ as they are described in the textual reports. After some preprocessing steps that include tokenization, named entity extraction and part-of-speech tagging, the textual risk mining system applies a variety of sequence classification algorithms, e.g., Conditional Random Fields, Conditional Markov Models and Hidden Markov Models in order to compare the risk classification performance. Empirical results show that our NLP/ML-based system can extract variable-length risk spans from the textual reports with about 90% correctness.","Markov processes,decision support systems,hidden Markov models,statistical distributions,tokenization,Risk management,attacked vessel incident,human intuition,Hidden Markov models,maritime geographical locations,conditional Markov models,maritime domain awareness,maritime command-and-control centers,Feature extraction,natural language processing,chased vessel incident,entity extraction,variable-length risk span extraction,maritime incident reports,maritime situational awareness,sequence classification algorithms,conditional random fields,robbed vessel incident,electronic sensors,United States worldwide threats to shipping reports repository,maritime situational awareness operation,fired vessel incident,marine safety,National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency,marine engineering,boarded vessel incident,feature annotation,machine learning,semiautomated decision support systems,cameras,part-of-speech tagging,risk management,NLP/ML-based system,Classification algorithms,probability distributions,risks types,risk classification performance,textual risk mining system,weekly textual reports,auxiliary ML,auxiliary machine learning,hijacked vessel incident,command and control systems,vessels,human perception,vessel types,MSA operation,kidnapped vessel incident,risk associates,risk detection,NGA,text analysis,boarding attempted vessel incident,approached vessel incident,Data mining,learning (artificial intelligence),sequence-based classifiers,"
"sea surface height measurements using a low-cost gnss buoy with multiple gnss receivers","2023","Accurate Sea surface height (SSH) measurements are important for global climate change and sea level rise monitoring. Satellite altimeters can provide global coverage observations but with coarse temporal and spatial resolution, while tide gauges offer high-precision measurements but are limited to coastal regions. The advent of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) buoys bridge the gap between the tide station and the satellite altimeter, which realize continuous and reliable absolute SSH measurements in the coastal zone. However, most of buoys are equipped with GNSS geodetic receivers and antennas, which are expensive and with high power consumption. The emergence of low-cost receivers has been applied in fields such as autonomous driving and disaster monitoring, yet low-cost receivers suffer precision limitations due to signal quality issue in the harsh marine environment. To solve the reliability issue of low-cost receivers in SSH measurements, firstly, a low-cost buoy platform with four dual-frequency receivers is designed in this contribution. GNSS antennas are installed on the four corners of a square with a side length of 1.180 m, and the total power consumption is less than 4 W. Additionally, a robust outlier detection method, the Geometric Constraint algorithm, is proposed to improve the reliability and accuracy of GNSS SSH results. The performance of our buoy was validated in Jingye Lake at Tianjin University on April 30, 2022, and another experiment was conducted in Bohai Bay, Tianjin, on August 20, 2022, to assess the performance of a self-developed MG-Buoy for SSH measurement under real oceanic conditions. The experimental results indicate that the precision of single-frequency SSH measurement is 0.91 cm using the GNSS Post Processed Kinematic (PPK) technique with a single antenna, while the dual-frequency can achieve 0.50 cm accuracy. After adopting the Geometric Constraint method, the measurement accuracy of single-frequency and dual-frequency SSH values are 0.49 cm and 0.40 cm, respectively, representing a 46.2% and 20.0% improvements compared to the root mean square (RMS) value for the single GNSS antenna.","Geometric Constraint,Sea surface height,Attitude measurements,Multiple GNSS receivers,Low-cost,Buoy,"
"automatic self-reconstruction model for radio map in wi-fi fingerprinting","2022","The Wi-Fi fingerprinting is applied to the indoor positioning system (IPS) based on the radio map, which is the established received signal strength indication (RSSI) fingerprint database. However, since static radio maps built offline are vulnerable to environmental dynamics, interruptions occur in the online phase. To solve this problem, in this paper, we propose an Automatic Self-Reconstruction (ASR) model that combines Radio Encoding-based Deep Fingerprint Positioning (RE-DFP) and Radio Anomaly Detecting (RAD), which enables seamless positioning of Wi-Fi fingerprinting. The proposed model consists of an encoder-decoder-based RE-DFP network to improve positioning accuracy and data efficiency and a RAD network to analyze environmental dynamics according to APs. In the proposed RE-DFP, a CNN-based encoder is applied to increase efficiency by minimizing the dependence of the radio map, and the position is estimated through an LSTM-based decoder. RAD identifies the AP, which is the cause of the change in the radio map and excludes it from the online phase, preventing a decrease in positioning accuracy. Simultaneously, the proposed model collects the RSSI of the identified AP through crowdsourcing and reconstructs the radio map by itself, enabling a seamless positioning service in the online phase.","Radio map,RE-DFP,Indoor positioning system,Fingerprinting,RAD,"
"a continuous record of vegetation, fire-regime and climatic changes in northwestern patagonia spanning the last 25,000 years","2018","We present a high-resolution precisely dated terrestrial paleovegetation/paleoclimate record from Lago Pichilaguna, northwestern Patagonia (40°–44°S), which spans continuously from the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) to the present. We find abundant and continuous presence of arboreal pollen (chiefly Nothofagus) during the LGM, accompanied by other trees, shrubs, and alpine herbs. These results suggest Subantarctic parkland and/or scattered woodlands under a cold and hyperhumid climate during the LGM (∼25,000–17,800 cal. yr BP) with expansion of Nothofagus under relatively warm interstadial conditions between 25,000 and 19,200 cal. yr BP. This was followed by cooling and a precipitation increase between 19,200 and 17,800 cal. yr BP, which was contemporaneous with the youngest LGM advance of Andean glaciers in the region and maximum influence of the Southern Westerly Wind (SWW). The Last Glacial Termination (T1) started at 17,800 cal. yr BP and featured the spread of thermophilous trees and ferns characteristic of North Patagonian rainforests, along with lake level lowering. These results suggest a warm pulse and southward shift of the SWW, concurrent with a rapid collapse of Andean glacier lobes. Subsequent changes led to the establishment of closed-canopy rainforests under peak interstadial warmth between ∼16,000 and 15,000 cal. yr BP. We detect a shift to cold/wet conditions during the Antarctic Cold Reversal (14,800–12,700 cal. yr BP) and a precipitation decline during Younger Dryas time, followed by maximum temperature, relatively lower lake level and minimum SWW influence between 11,300 and 7700 cal. yr BP. Precipitation then rose punctuated by centennial-scale variations since 6200 cal. yr BP. Chilean-European deforestation and spread of invasive exotic species started at ∼350 cal. yr BP aided by fire. We conclude that temperate rainforests have persisted with little interruption since T1, with major changes in floristic composition driven by climate change and fires. Rainforest composition and heterogeneity declined in response to Chilean/European disturbance during the 1600s and intensified since the 1800s. These events constitute the fastest/largest-magnitude vegetation changes of the last ∼25,000 years.","Southern westerly winds,Vegetation history,Last glacial termination,Fire disturbance,Holocene,Last glacial maximum,Northwestern patagonia,"
"the wedge clam (donax trunculus) hand-operated fishery in the nw mediterranean sea: landings, catch composition, damage rates and impact of fishing activity","2023","The bivalve wedge clam Donax trunculus is a highly valued species in Spain, but wild stocks have decreased in the Mediterranean region in recent decades. Internal demand exceeds the existing supply derived from local production. Hand-operated dredge fishery is still important in some coastal areas of Spain, such as the Ebro Delta (NE Spain). However, scientific information is lacking on most aspects of this fishery which is essential for its sustainable management. In this context, this study aimed to provide the first characterization of the hand-operated dredges fishery; evaluate the damage of this fishery on the megabenthic fauna; and analyze the impact of the fishing activity on the wedge clam. Our results indicate that landings declined dramatically since the mid-1990s and the main causes for this decline are postulated. Fishing effort was highly seasonal, being more intense from March to September. The discard fraction was very small (5.74% in abundance and the 3.74% in biomass) and 61.93% of the discards did not suffer damage. Clam fishing activity had an impact on recruit density in the short term (3 months), but not on recruit size and commercial fraction density, biomass and size. Our results provide tools for a better management of this type of fisheries.","Small-scale fisheries,Wedge clam,Clam fisheries,Management,"
"changes in maritime traffic patterns according to installation of floating lidar using spatial analysis","2023","Recently, with the development of marine space around the world, friction between maritime traffic and various marine activities is intensifying. In particular, different recommendations are being made for the buffer zone between offshore wind farms and maritime traffic, as the criteria vary significantly. In order to respond to these changes in marine space, conducted this study on the change of maritime traffic patterns before and after the installation of floating LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) in marine facilities and apply it to future changes in maritime traffic patterns. The maritime traffic data was based on Automatic Identification System (AIS) data, and it was targeted at cargo ships and tankers with regular traffic patterns. A trajectory and spatial analysis were performed based on the AIS in the marine space. As a result of analyzing the globally maritime traffic patterns targeting the location of the installation complex of LiDARs, it can be confirmed that the existing maritime traffic patterns change into three maritime traffic patterns. Furthermore, the study employed the Hausdorff-distance algorithm for clustering analysis, categorizing vessels with similar trajectories. This approach facilitated a locally analysis of the buffer zone associated with individual LiDAR, considering the length of the vessels. As a result, it was analyzed that each vessel navigated at different buffer zone depending on the size of the vessel, and it is possible for safe navigation and forecast the future maritime traffic patterns.","Traffic control,Maritime traffic,maritime traffic data,buffer zone,Marine vehicles,wind power plants,globally maritime traffic patterns,Laser radar,marine space,existing maritime traffic patterns change,ships,marine safety,marine engineering,Wind farms,marine facilities,Oceans,regular traffic patterns,pattern clustering,Artificial intelligence,offshore installations,optical radar,future maritime traffic patterns,telecommunication traffic,spatial analysis,automatic identification system (AIS),Analytical models,"
"a history of vegetation, sediment and nutrient dynamics at tivoli north bay, hudson estuary, new york","2012","We conduct a stratigraphic paleoecological investigation at a Hudson River National Estuarine Research Reserve (HRNERR) site, Tivoli Bays, spanning the past 1100 years. Marsh sediment cores were analyzed for ecosystem changes using multiple proxies, including pollen, spores, macrofossils, charcoal, sediment bulk chemistry, and stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes. The results reveal climatic shifts such as the warm and dry Medieval Warm Period (MWP) followed by the cooler Little Ice Age (LIA), along with significant anthropogenic influence on the watershed ecosystem. A five-fold expansion of invasive species, including Typha angustifolia and Phragmites australis, is documented along with marked changes in sediment composition and nutrient input. During the last century, a ten-fold sedimentation rate increase due to land-use changes is observed. The large magnitude of shifts in vegetation, sedimentation, and nutrients during the last few centuries suggest that human activities have made the greatest impact to the marshes of the Hudson Estuary during the last millennium. Climate variability and ecosystem changes similar to those observed at other marshes in northeastern and mid-Atlantic estuaries, attest to the widespread regional signature recorded at Tivoli Bays.","nitrogen cycle,tidal marshes,invasive species,New York,Little Ice Age,Medieval Warm period,paleoecology,stable isotopes,climate change,European settlement,palynology,"
"making sense of heterogeneous maritime data","2022","While an abundance of real-time maritime information exists and is readily available to monitoring authorities, there are still many instances in which ships are found to be engaged in dangerous or illegal activities. In order to prevent such activities, authorities employ Vessel Traffic Services systems since they promote safety at sea while also assisting in management of ports. In this paper we report on research done in cooperation with Denbridge Marine Ltd., a global provider of maritime solutions, and present an application integrated in a Vessel Tracking Services system that allows the detection of normal vessel activity as well as dangerous or illegal situations in real-time, using information from the Automatic Identification System, a radar sensor and other information. We use a set of phenomena representing maritime activities of interest in the language of Phenesthe, our Complex Event Processing engine, and detect them on real maritime data streams from the area of Liverpool, United Kingdom. We evaluate our application and show that our system is capable of detecting and visualising maritime activities on the map in real time. Finally, we study and demonstrate the significance of using data from the Automatic Identification System along with radar data for maritime monitoring.","RADAR,complex event processing engine,Safety,vessel tracking services system,complex event processing,Marine vehicles,radar data,vessel traffic services systems,temporal logic,ships,automatic identification system,marine safety,marine engineering,AIS,Seaports,heterogeneous maritime data monitoring,Radar tracking,Real-time systems,Data visualization,maritime monitoring,condition monitoring,United Kingdom,Radar detection,"
"study of the classification task into an integrated multisensor system for maritime border control","2008","This work focuses on the classification task performed into a multi-sensor system for the coastal surveillance. The system is composed of two platforms of sensors: a land based platform, equipped with a land based radar, an Automatic Identification System (AIS) and an infrared camera (IR); an airborne platform, carrying an airborne radar that can operate in a spotlight Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) mode, a video camera, and a second IR camera. The tasks performed by the system are the detection, tracking, identification, and classification of multiple targets, the evaluation of their threat level, and the selection of an intervention on them. The classification algorithm implemented inside the system exploits an analytical approach based on the confusion matrix (CM) of the imaging sensors that belong to the system.

"the first detection of the madden-julian oscillation signal in daily to hourly resolution proxy records derived from a natural archive of giant clam shell (tridacna spp.)","2021","The Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) is the most prominent mode of intraseasonal variability in the tropics which is responsible for much of the observed intraseasonal climate variance not only there but also in higher latitudes. The short time-span of modern instrumental data limits our understanding of the MJO and obtaining MJO information from natural archives could extend this greatly. Here a Giant Clam shell (Tridacna spp.) with a life span about two years (from January 29, 2012 to December 9, 2013) was collected from the northern South China Sea, in the western Pacific. Several daily to hourly resolution biological and geochemical proxy records, including the daily growth rate, hourly Fe/Ca, Sr/Ca and fluorescence intensity, were developed to compare these with local weather/climate records. Spectral analyses suggested that these ultra-high resolution proxy records can clearly record MJO variability in the tropics. The substantial connection between the proxy records and MJO possibly linking through the local effective solar radiation, SST, precipitation and wind speeds. This is the first record of the MJO signal in a natural paleoclimate archive. Our findings provide new insights to study the MJO beyond the instrumental records, and since fossil Tridacna shells from different geological times can be used to investigate the MJO under various climate conditions.","shell,MJO,proxy records,daily growth rate,ultra-high-resolution,"
"a framework for discovering maritime traffic conflict from ais network","2017","Thanks for the common use of Automatic Identification System (AIS) network has made a large number of the maritime traffic data to be available. Ships equipped with AIS automatically exchange navigational information with nearby ships and terrestrial AIS receivers to facilitate the tracking and monitoring of ships' location and movement for collision avoidance and control. Obviously, with increasing amount of maritime shipping traffic, the navigational collisions are one of the growing safety concerns in maritime traffic situation awareness. To understand the collision situations can help the maritime traffic managers to improve the safety control of maritime traffic. However, it is difficult to statistically analyze such collision due to the number of collected real cases of collisions are relatively low within a short period of time. To overcome the problem of low sample size, we discover traffic conflict from data collected by AIS network to substitute the real collision. Given a set of maritime traffic data collected from AIS network, we try to discover ships' movements that have conflict behaviors and these behaviors may bring a possible collision if they do not take any evasive action. We propose a framework of Clustering-and-Detection to automatically discover the clusters of conflict trajectory from AIS trajectory data in an unsupervised way. Based on real AIS data, the experimental results show that the proposed framework is able to effectively discover sets of trajectory with conflict situation from maritime AIS traffic data. The statistical analysis on the discovered sets of conflict trajectory is able to provide useful knowledge for maritime traffic monitoring.","maritime traffic situation awareness,maritime traffic monitoring,maritime shipping traffic,maritime traffic conflict,maritime AIS traffic data,collision situations,Safety,maritime traffic data,Automatic Identification System network,Marine vehicles,AIS network,ships,marine safety,marine engineering,real AIS data,terrestrial AIS receivers,pattern clustering,Trajectory data mining,Artificial intelligence,safety control,conflict behaviors,clustering-and-detection,AIS data,Roads,Trajectory,conflict trajectory,conflict situation,Conflict detection,Maritime traffic data,Navigation,navigation,nearby ships,collision avoidance,Data mining,navigational collisions,maritime traffic managers,Navigation collision,"
"application of track-before-detect techniques in gnss-based passive radar for maritime surveillance","2019","GNSS-based passive radar has been recently proved able to enable moving target detection in maritime surveillance applications. The main restriction lies in the low Equivalent Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRP) level of navigation satellites. Extending the integration times with proper target motion compensation has been shown to be a viable solution to improve ship detectability, but this involves computational complexity and increasing sensitivity to motion model mismatches. In this work, we consider the application of a Track-Before-Detect (TBD) method to considerably increase the integration time (and therefore the detection capability) at the same time keeping the computational complexity affordable by practical systems. Dynamic programming TBD algorithms have been specialized for the considered framework and tested against experimental dataset. The obtained results show the effectiveness of this approach to improve the detection capability of the system despite the restricted power budget.","Satellites,moving target detection,long-integration time,marine radar,radar detection,passive radar,track-before-detect,Program processors,ship detectability,satellite navigation,track-before-detect techniques,maritime surveillance,Target tracking,track-before-detect method,search radar,motion model mismatches,Radar tracking,Doppler effect,integration time,radar tracking,low equivalent isotropic radiated power level,maritime surveillance applications,restricted power budget,Passive radar,marine communication,GNSS-based passive radar,Surveillance,detection capability,target motion compensation,"
"disentangling dust and sand deposition using a peat record in ce europe (northern romania): a multiproxy approach","2019","Aeolian sediments play an important role in the global climatic system and occur in the atmosphere due to soil and bedrock erosion. Here, we applied three different methods: geochemical (XRF), manual and laser-based particle size analysis to an ombrotrophic peat profile in the Carpathian Mountains to determine changes in aeolian deposition and wind/storm activity over the last 7800 years. The results show the following changes in aeolian fluxes (dust and sand) over time: 7800–4150 cal. yr BP – generally low dust fluxes with a periodic intensification of sand fluxes; 4150–2300 cal. yr BP – intense deposition of both dust and sand; 2300–150 cal. yr BP – fluctuating dust and sand fluxes; the last 200 years – the highest amplitude of both sand and dust fluxes. This study found that patterns in aeolian fluxes were influenced by a combination of climate and human impact, but with anthropogenic drivers, such as disturbance by fire, becoming more important in recent times. We also found a good agreement with other studies of dust fluxes for the earlier part of this record, but an increasing divergence over the last 3500 years. In terms of a methodological approach, we suggest that the three approaches each have both advantages and disadvantages; though overall laser-based particle size dust and sand reconstruction appears to best capture the most complex changes in both aeolian deposition rates and sources.","Particulate mineralogy,Manual counting of sand particles,Particle size analysis,Aeolian particles,Geochemistry,"

We first propose the space-air-ground-edge (SAGE) maritime communication network architecture. This novel architecture is used to offload computing-intensive applications and services for IoT users in the marine environment. At the same time, based on the Multi-Armed Bandits (MAB) problem, considering budget constraints and other marine environmental conditions such as delay and energy consumption, we propose an algorithm for selecting an edge server strategy.

"gis-based identification of spatial variables enhancing heat and poor air quality in urban areas","2012","Due to anthropogenic climate change heat waves are expected to occur more frequently in the future, which might cause adverse health effects for urban population. Especially the combination of high temperatures and poor air quality impinges on the well-being of man. This accentuates the need for assessing the health risks of residents regarding air pollutants and anomalously high summer air temperatures. However, comprehensive information on the spatial and temporal distribution of temperature and particulate matter (PM) concentration in cities are presently difficult to obtain since only few measurement sites exist. In order to identify hot spots with high health risks for distinct groups of urban population, measurement campaigns were carried out, capturing the spatial distribution of temperature and PM concentrations in the City of Aachen, Germany (pop. 245,000). Several locations were selected to examine spatial influences such as topography, building density, vegetation and traffic on temperature and PM. The findings permit the detection of urban environmental variables that contribute to both temperature enhancement and poor air quality. Those variables were used as spatial predictors for the identification of possible hot spots inside and outside the area of field measurements. The zones of enhanced risks of high air temperature and PM levels were detected by means of GIS based geo-statistic modeling. These areas were mainly identified in the inner city, which is characterized by a dense building structure and heavy traffic. A chemical characterization of different PM fractions complements the GIS based investigations. The analysis of toxicologically relevant components provides information on air quality at urban, suburban and rural sites. The results of the chemical analyses support the results obtained from geo-statistical modeling. It reveals high concentrations of health relevant airborne species like metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons within the zone of enhanced risk for the coincidence of temperature stress and PM pollution.","Heat,Air pollution,Health,Particulate matter,Climate change,GIS,"

"maritime border security using sensors, processing, and platforms to detect dark vessels","2018","Maritime security is critical to national prosperity, but with a large area to be secured and limited resources available, our current maritime situational awareness is not sufficient to secure our borders. This challenge is compounded by the fact that many bad actors intentionally avoid using transponders to obscure their location and actions for nefarious purposes. New solutions are required to detect these â€œdarkâ€ vessels in the expansive maritime domain and thereby enable increased maritime situational awareness and security. In this paper, we present a concept for increased maritime situational awareness, specifically designed to secure our borders against dark vessels using a novel combination of existing technologies.

"estimation of the contributions of the sources driving pm2.5 levels in a central mediterranean coastal town","2018","Receptor modelling techniques are widely used in order to identify the main natural and anthropogenic processes driving aerosol levels at a receptor. In this work, Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) was used to apportion PM2.5 levels at a traffic site (Msida) located in a coastal town. 180 filters collected throughout a yearly sampling campaign conducted in 2016, were chemically characterized by light absorbance analysis, x-ray fluorescence and ion chromatography in order to determine the concentrations of black carbon, 17 elements and 5 ions, respectively. The resulting chemical data base was used in conjunction with PMF in order to identify the 7 components affecting the PM2.5 levels at the receptor site. Six of these sources are considered to be typical of the atmospheric composition of coastal traffic sites: traffic (27.3%), ammonium sulfate (23.6%), Saharan dust (15%), aged sea salt (12.7%), shipping (5%) and fresh sea salt (4.6%). This is the first time that such a study was carried out in Malta and helps in understanding the aerosol pollution climate of the Central Mediterranean, which is still relatively understudied when compared to the Eastern and Western Mediterranean. Furthermore, we have isolated a factor exclusive to Malta: the fireworks component, which is responsible for 2.9% of the PM2.5 and which has health implications due to its chemical composition. The results of this work should also serve to guide the policy makers in achieving the necessary emission reductions in order to achieve the WHO guideline for PM2.5 by 2020.","PM,Positive matrix factorization,Natural aerosol sources,Anthropogenic aerosol sources,Source apportionment,Central mediterranean,"

"intelligent edge-enabled efficient multi-source data fusion for autonomous surface vehicles in maritime internet of things","2022","With the rapid development of low-end Internet of Things (IoT) devices and shipborne sensors, efficient multi-source data fusion methods for autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) have recently attracted significant research interest in intelligent edge-enabled maritime applications. The data fusion capacity can enhance the situation awareness of ASVs, leading to improved efficacy and safety in ASV-empowered maritime IoT (MIoT). Both cameras and automatic identification system (AIS) equipment, which provide visual and positioning information, respectively, have become the commonly adopted cost-effective sensors. In this work, we first introduce a lightweight YOLOX-s network with transfer learning to accurately and robustly detect the moving vessels at different scales in real time. A data augmentation method is then proposed to promote its generalization ability. The detected vessels and synchronous AIS messages are finally fused to make full use of the multi-source sensing data, contributing to an augmented reality (AR)-based maritime navigation system at the shipborne intelligent edges. The AR system is able to superimpose both static and dynamic information from the collected AIS messages onto the video-captured images. It has the capacity of providing auxiliary information for early warning of navigation risks for ASVs in MIoT networks. Compared with traditional single-sensor-based navigation methods, our data fusion framework exhibits more reliable and robust results, and appears to have substantial practical potential applications.

"efficient lidar-based object segmentation and mapping for maritime environments","2019","This paper proposes a method that utilizes a 3-D occupancy grid to efficiently map a large area while retaining simple representations of objects for path planning and provide spatial characteristics of objects, which may be used for object classification. To enable large-scale mapping of objects, a region around the unmanned surface vehicle (USV) is defined where a high density of LiDAR returns is expected, termed the visibility horizon. The polygon intersection between the visibility horizon and the newly detected objects is computed, as well as the polygon subtraction of the visibility horizon from the mapped list of polygons. The two polygon lists are then combined using a polygon union operation, with the objects retaining class designations. The result is a 2-D map that contains polygon representations of objects, where the object is described with a tunable number of vertices and may have an associated object class. Thus, providing necessary information for path planning and tasking.

"learning maritime obstacle detection from weak annotations by scaffolding","2022","Coastal water autonomous boats rely on robust perception methods for obstacle detection and timely collision avoidance. The current state-of-the-art is based on deep segmentation networks trained on large datasets. Per-pixel ground truth labeling of such datasets, however, is labor-intensive and expensive. We observe that far less information is required for practical obstacle avoidance - the location of water edge on static obstacles like shore and approximate location and bounds of dynamic obstacles in the water is sufficient to plan a reaction. We propose a new scaffolding learning regime (SLR) that allows training obstacle detection segmentation networks only from such weak annotations, thus significantly reducing the cost of ground-truth labeling. Experiments show that maritime obstacle segmentation networks trained using SLR substantially outperform the same networks trained with dense ground truth labels, despite a significant reduction in labelling effort.

"radar detection of low-altitude targets in a maritime environment","1995","Results from a unique analytical and experimental effort to assess low-altitude, short-range, radar detection capabilities in an evaporation ducting environment are presented. Within the horizon, the duct may shift the location of the last interference null several kilometers in range, which may cause nondetection at ranges where detection is expected and detection at ranges where detection is not expected. In addition, the evaporation duct may reduce the signal strength at ranges near the last interference peak so that detection of low-altitude, small-size, targets may not be possible until the target is much closer. At ranges near and beyond the horizon, radar signal strength depends both on the surface layer and on the mixed layer. To accurately model propagation in this region, knowledge of both surface layer and upper air meteorology Is required. An empirical model to merge the surface layer with the mixed layer has been developed. Comparisons of measured to calculated detection range indicate that the assumption of a standard atmosphere minimizes the variance of the difference between the detection ranges whereas ranges calculated using the measured surface meteorological conditions and a modified surface layer model minimizes the median of the difference.<>","evaporation,surface layer,propagation,Ducts,radar detection,surface meteorological conditions,atmospheric boundary layer,signal strength,low-altitude targets,SHF,9415 MHz,Sea measurements,military systems,Meteorology,Atmospheric modeling,tropospheric electromagnetic wave propagation,marine systems,X-band,microwave propagation,electromagnetic wave interference,Atmosphere,Oceans,atmospheric humidity,Sea surface,radar interference,Atmospheric measurements,radiofrequency interference,evaporation ducting environment,maritime environment,mixed layer,small-size targets,short-range radar detection,horizon,Interference,last interference null,Radar detection,"
"trial results conducted by multiple canadian government agencies of the recent covert technology developped by tektrap to trace and track the integrity of maritime containers worldwide","2012","iCargo is an easy-to-install miniature covert electronic device combining GPS and door lock tracking with wireless and satellite communications to remotely track the status and position of maritime containers worldwide. A system of strategically placed readers combined with satellite or cellular communications and redundant technologies ensures that security breaches are detected early and reliably anywhere along the supply chain. iCargo provides a GPS trace of where a container has travelled and where the container might have been opened. Deviations from the expected itinerary in time and/or distance are detected and the container can be flagged for physical inspection. Such a system helps borders authorities to focus their energy on suspicious cargo with the overall impact of speeding the flow of all cargo. iCargo uses a patented technique to convert the metal structure of the container into an antenna thereby allowing it to be installed behind the rubber seal of the door in a truly covert fashion. Other technologies are visible from the exterior and vulnerable to tampering and damage during container handling. The location within the door gasket is ideal for monitoring the door open/close status as well as for acting as a communications gateway to optional internal sensors. There are approximately 7 million maritime containers entering/leaving North America every year. The interiors of such containers are rarely inspected. Such containers may include contraband, hazmats, weapons or illegal items that present an economic or security risk. Despite significant security improvements since Sept-11th, only 5% of the maritime containers go through physical inspection. The use of the iCargo mounted on a container at the point of departure will assist government authorities in making better decisions about which containers to inspect thereby speeding up the overall throughput of all containers. In today's lean economy, goods in transit do not contribute to economic growth but instead are added costs to customers and shippers. With rising fuel and transportation costs, delays at borders are becoming increasingly expensive. Early detection via the iCargo system will help to reduce these costs by not only helping to shorten inspection delays but by also allowing officials to focus their energy on suspicious cargo thereby improving border security. Tektrap has been selected for the Pool of Pre-qualified Proposals for the Canadian Innovation Commercialization Program (CICP). CICP is a very competitive program that targets recent innovations, especially in the field of national security, which are ready for the beta phase of product development. Within this award, iCargo will be evaluated during spring and early summer 2012 by Canada Border Services Agency for Canadian-US border application, by Defense Research and Development Canada, DND, for land, rail and air applications in the Canada Nordic environment, and by Transport Canada for trans-Canada land/rail and Asia-Canada sea conditions.

Although multiple probabilistic approaches have been implemented for explaining different parametric maritime phenomena, most of them are focused only on the analysis of primary kinematic data, such as position, speed, course of vessels, or lateral displacement relative to an obstacle. This article presents an analysis on multiple complex maritime activities (e.g., fishing, drifting, hidden activities) that were derived by processing AIS messages collected in the Black Sea region. Quantitative histograms were made for each type of activity while probability and cumulative distribution functions were plotted using kernel density estimation applications. After that, multiple evaluation metrics analysed the possibilities of representing these distributions in the form of known parametric distributions (e.g., Gaussian, Gamma, Rayleigh, Log-normal).

"fault detection and diagnosis of a blade pitch system in a floating wind turbine based on kalman filters and artificial neural networks","2021","This paper describes the development of a fault detection and diagnosis method to automatically identify different fault conditions of a hydraulic blade pitch system in a spar-type floating wind turbine. For fault detection, a Kalman filter is employed to estimate the blade pitch angle and valve spool position of the blade pitch system. The fault diagnosis scheme is based on an artificial neural network method with supervised learning that is capable of diagnosing a predetermined fault type. The neural network algorithm produces a predictive model with training, validation and test procedures after the final performance evaluation. The validation and test procedures of the artificial neural network model are conducted with the training model to prove the model performance. The proposed method is demonstrated in case studies of a spar floating wind turbine with stochastic wind and wave conditions and with consideration of six different types of faults, such as biases and fixed outputs in pitch sensors and excessive friction, slit-lock, wrong voltage, and circuit shortage in actuators.

Then, S- and X-band range/velocity acquisitions allowed to confirm the coherent dual band operation, posing the basis for the next step: the development of adapted coherent data fusion algorithms for target imaging.","silicon,silicon-on-insulator platform,outdoor field trial,sensor fusion,dual-band silicon integrated photonics-based radar,Ku-band,radar system,dual-band photonics-based radar,radar detection,radio transceivers,radar antennas,dual band radar transceiver,CW radar,Laser radar,integrated optics,Radio frequency,complex maritime scene,maritime field trial,silicon photonics,ships,Integrated optics,Optical modulation,system level,radar,object detection,search radar,printed circuits,relevant maritime environment,Radar,radar signal processing,complete radar system,conventional radars,X-bands,radar behavior,chip,X-band radar acquisitions,integrated photonic circuits,coherent dual band operation,probability,Photonic integration,Photonics,dual band operation,developed apparatus,printed circuit board,Spaceborne radar,transceivers,FM radar,radar state,"
"potential impact of long-life environmental sonobuoys on littoral asw","2009","The focus of military activity has recently shifted from large area engagements to regional conflicts. Consequently, supportive Naval maritime operations have continued to evolve toward littoral warfare in complicated shallow-water, near-shore environments. This evolution requires new sensors, advanced Concept of Operations, and improved data-analysis capabilities, among others. Planning operations in these harsh-environment areas is difficult because accurate predictions of tactical sensor performance depend on detailed knowledge of the local environmental conditions. Tactical mission planning is thus seldom optimal or efficient, often resulting in coverage gaps, increased risk, and reduced mission success. According to a Navy Mission Need Statement, 'Air ASW tactical execution, especially in littoral seas, requires in-situ environmental updates for preflight mission planning. In the conduct of ASW operations, an urgent need for explicit knowledge of environmental variables is required to optimize the effectiveness of operational acoustic sensors, as well as acoustic sensors in development ' The Naval Air Systems Command has considered extended-life environmental sonobuoy concepts to better characterize the littoral environment. Most designs contain a thermistor string to measure ocean temperatures and also hydrophones to measure ambient noise. This type of complex sonobuoy would be more expensive than a traditional single-measurement AXBT but it could provide a more thorough littoral environment assessment. This paper examines the trade-off between increased sensor complexity and improved ASW performance, in terms of cumulative detection probability. Some advantages of an extended-life combined thermistor string/hydrophone approach, compared to AXBTs and tactical hydrophones, are: 1) higher accuracy of the raw data; 2) temporal averaging to smooth out fluctuations; 3) extended area coverage during drift; 4) less chance for surface temperature anomalies (e.g., mixed-layer-depth errors) caused by various electronic and mechanical variability upon impact; 5) opportunities to discover thermal and acoustic feature boundaries during drift; and 6) less need to re-seed thus allowing longer tactical mission times. These advantages are evaluated relative to the following disadvantages: 1) increased cost; 2) potential drift outside the mission area; and 3) need for increased battery life for longer durations. The analysis is tempered by considering how a potential new system might be used. One assumption is that an environmental sampling decision aid is available to determine the minimum number and best initial locations of drifting sensors to meet performance objectives. The November 2007 Requirements Document from the Naval Oceanographic Office states ?Sampling guidance: Development of guidance on the best way to deploy, spatially and temporally, observation systems in order to meet various forecasting, model assimilation, and model evaluation objectives is needed.? Work in this area is reported in this Oceans '09 Conference in a paper entitled ?Uncertainty-based Adaptive AXBT Sampling with SPOTS?, which addresses optimal sampling requirements. For this trade-off analysis, temperature data from watersampling flights in the Sea of Japan off the east coast of Korea were used to simulate expected capability of a long-term drifting thermistor string. Then optimal initial positions for three notional buoys were determined followed by a simulation of drifting positions and data collected over 12 days. Ocean nowcasts were constructed and used to determine acoustic performance of a notional tactical sonobuoy field. The analysis shows that a drifting extended-life thermistor string can provide significant improvement in environmental characterization, tactical planning, and ASW detection performance.","Acoustic measurements,Sea measurements,military systems,Predictive models,Sonar equipment,Sampling methods,Ocean temperature,Noise measurement,littoral ASW,operational acoustic sensors,Thermistors,Temperature measurement,Acoustic sensors,long-life environmental sonobuoys,"
"the assessment of air and soil as contributors of some trace metals to vegetable plants i. use of a filtered air growth cabinet","1989","The sources of heavy metals in a number of consumer crops were investigated in the laboratory by growing plants in a dual growth cabinet supplied with both clean and ambient air. Under these conditions, plants were exposed separately to filtered and normal ambient air to assess the influences of soil and atmosphere on the accumulation of Cd, Pb, Zn, Cr and Ni. Radish, carrot, pea, spinach and lettuce plants were successfully grown in the cabinet. Analysis of the metals in the plant tissues showed that the foliar route is potentially of similar importance to the soil-root pathway as a route of transport to the exposed parts of the plants. Whilst the exposed parts showed the highest metal accumulation from the air, the levels of metals in fruits and storage roots resulting from foliar translocation of the airborne component appeared to be low generally. The metal which achieved highest translocation from foliar deposition was Pb. The effect of spraying plants with rain-water was to enhance slightly the total content of all trace metals analysed.",""
"incipient anomalous ionospheric divergence fast detection for coastal differential global navigation satellite system","2023","Differential Global Navigation Satellite System (DGNSS) plays an increasingly important role in the maritime field. Irregular ionospheric divergences may result in DGNSS performance degradation and increase risk in terms of positioning accuracy and navigation integrity. To speed up incipient ionospheric anomaly detection, this paper proposes a novel method for the DGNSS stations which employs (1) the Wasserstein distance (WD) to identify dissimilarity between GNSS pseudorange and carrier-phase measurements and (2) the least-mean-square (LMS) filter to smooth the calculated metrics. The combined WD-LMS is proposed to ensure the rapid identification of abnormal ionospheric divergences. Taking the multipath into account, which is especially severe in the low elevation angle case, elevation-angle related strategies are developed. Both semi-simulated and real experiments are conducted. For the high-elevation angle case, the WD-LMS is even potential to detect large ionospheric divergences within ten epochs. Therefore, the WD-LMS has encouraging potential to enhance maritime DGNSS navigation performance.","DGNSS,Marine navigation,Ionospheric divergences,"
"track association and fusion in maritime tactical data system: a review","2022","Tactical Data System (TDS) is a software system used on ship/aircraft platforms for navigation and surveillance. In the maritime domain, modern TDS is connected to various sensors such as Radar, Automatic Identification System (AIS), and Tactical Data Link Processor (TDLP) where each sensor usually has its independent tracking system. The tracks of each tracker must be associated and fused so that valid and reliable information about situational awareness appears in TDS. Each of the data generated by trackers has different characteristics and problems, which prompted many researchers to formulate algorithms suitable for track associations. In this paper, we present the results of our preliminary research regarding the track association to be used in maritime TDS. The results of the analysis from this study will then be used in further research that is more specific about the proposed track association method.","modern TDS,surveillance,tracker,track association,sensor fusion,telecommunication computing,reliable information,tactical data link processor,aircraft platform,maritime tactical data system,TDLP,valid information,target tracking,ship platform,software system,military computing,ships,automatic identification system,track fusion,tactical data system,radar,AIS,track association method,maritime domain,Radar tracking,Software systems,situational awareness,Radar,command and control systems,Training,maritime TDS,Navigation,Surveillance,independent tracking system,navigation,military communication,Technological innovation,"
"contribution of anthropogenic and natural sources in pm10 during north african dust events in southern europe","2021","The influence of North African (NAF) dust events on the air quality at the regional level (12 representative monitoring stations) in Southern Europe during a long time series (2007–2014) was studied. PM10 levels and chemical composition were separated by Atlantic (ATL) and NAF air masses. An increase in the average PM10 concentrations was observed on sampling days with NAF dust influence (42 μg m−3) when compared to ATL air masses (29 μg m−3). Major compounds such as crustal components and secondary inorganic compounds (SIC), as well as toxic trace elements derived from industrial emissions, also showed higher concentrations of NAF events. A source contribution analysis using positive matrix factorisation (PMF) 5.0 of the PM10 chemical data, discriminating ATL and NAF air mass origins, allowed the identification of five sources: crustal, sea salt, traffic, regional, and industrial. A higher contribution (74%) of the natural sources to PM10 concentrations was confirmed under NAF episodes compared with ATL. Furthermore, there was an increase in anthropogenic sources during these events (51%), indicating the important influence of the NAF air masses on these sources. The results of this study highlight that environmental managers should take appropriate actions to reduce local emissions during NAF events to ensure good air quality.","PM10,Source contribution,North African dust,Southern Europe,"
"soil anomaly mapping using a caesium magnetometer: limits in the low magnetic amplitude case","2006","Caesium magnetometers are new tools for soil property mapping with a decimetric resolution [Mathé, V., Lévêque, F., 2003. High resolution magnetic survey for soil monitoring: detection of drainage and soil tillage effects. Earth and Planetary Science Letters 212 (1–2), 241–251]. However, when the magnetic anomalies are only a few nanoteslas (nT), the geologic and pedogenic signal must first be isolated from magnetic disturbances for this method to be useful. This paper investigates the instrumental artifacts and environmental disturbances to adapt the survey protocol to slightly magnetic soils. Among the possible instrumental sources of disturbances listed and quantified, the most significant are: 1) The battery effect upon sensors 2 m away (classic protocol, about ±0.15 nT) while increasing this distance up to 10 m cancelled it; 2) The noise level of magnetometers and sensors, which, according to tests on two magnetometers and three sensors, rarely and randomly exceeds 0.1 nT, but seems to increase with the electronic component age. Among the environmental disturbances, temporal variations such as diurnal variation or fluctuations linked to the moving of metallic masses play a major role, although the pseudogradient or base-station methods have commonly cancelled them. The efficiency of the latter is strongly dependent on the source nature. However, the ground currents and electromagnetic fields propagating in soils cause more problems. As a first step to better understand such disturbance sources, uncommon magnetic signal variations supposedly due to electromagnetic wave conversions and likely linked to the railway traffic are presented. Based on previous results, an adapted protocol using one magnetometer and two caesium sensors (0.3 and 1.6 m above the surface) is proposed to increase the signal/noise ratio. At first, to maintain an accurate horizontal and vertical location of the sensors, the latter are affixed to a wooden handcart running on plastic rails. Rails adapt to micro-topography, thereby decreasing strongly the soil–sensors distance variations. Anomalies due to topography rarely exceed 0.1 nT. Finally, a method to remove diurnal variations from high-resolution magnetic maps is proposed. Parallel profiles performed successively are adjusted by a cross-profile. Assuming that the temporal variations during each profile are negligible (less than 0.05 nT), this technique, contrary to the pseudogradient, preserves both the decimetric and the metric anomalies (gain of more than 1 nT).","Marshland soils,Survey protocol,Caesium magnetometer,High-resolution magnetic survey,Seismomagnetic wave conversions,"
"a deep learning framework for enhancing maritime coastal security","2021","The concerns of coastal security are very dynamic which depends on several factors like the neighbourhood of the country, the terrain and the marine traffic. As in the present system, only the vessels which emit Automatic Identification System (AIS) data streams can be detected and identified. Small vessels like some boats do not have AIS system setup, so they can get past without getting detected. Therefore, we propose a solution by framing a deep learning architecture namely faster region based convolutional neural network (Faster R-CNN) which accurately detects vessels in satellite images and outputs the latitude and longitude coordinates which when merged with AIS data helps identify whether the vessel is registered or not. Along with this, our paper also focuses on threat level detections from the unregistered vessels to analyze any terrorizing activity that may occur along the coastline.","Satellites,Faster Region Based Convolutional Neural Network,deep learning (artificial intelligence),maritime coastal security,Faster R-CNN,threat level detections,Sea measurements,marine safety,terrorism,marine engineering,Automatic Identification System,AIS,maritime surveillance,object detection,data streams,longitude coordinates,Haversine,neural net architecture,faster region based convolutional neural network,Real-time systems,latitude coordinates,convolutional neural nets,Tracking,terrorizing activity,Euclidian,Deep learning,Surveillance,deep learning architecture,vessel,Security,AIS data,"
"maritime route and vessel tracklet dataset for vessel-to-route association","2022","With an ever-increasing number of vessels at sea, the modelling, analysis and visualisation of maritime traffic are of paramount importance to support the monitoring tasks of maritime stakeholders. Sensors have been developed in this respect to track vessels and capture the maritime traffic at the global scale. The Automatic Identification System (AIS) is transmitting maritime positional and nominative information at highest frequency rate, making it a valuable source for maritime traffic modelling. From an original AIS dataset covering the area of Brest, France, we extracted a set of 17 maritime routes, connecting ports in this area. Two different representations for the routes are provided: (1) clusters of AIS contacts, and (2) route prototypes, representing the nominal trajectory of the vessels following the route. Additionally, a set of tracklets (built by five consecutive AIS contacts from the same vessel trajectory) has been extracted from the set of routes and the original dataset, and labelled either with the route name to which they belong or as off-route tracklets. This dataset provides thus some ground truth on the routes followed by vessels and is aimed at testing and validating vessel-to-route or track-to-route association algorithms.","Track-to-route association,Vessel-to-route association,Route prototypes,Maritime routes,Automatic identification system,"
"minimum winter temperature reconstruction from average earlywood vessel area of european oak (quercus robur) in n-poland","2016","Tree-ring-based temperature reconstructions form a substantial part of the international proxy data base used to examine and model global climate variations of the last Millennium. However, most tree-ring-based reconstructions are derived from study sites in the high latitudes or high altitudes, paying very little attention to low elevation sites. Thus, a large gap in the geographical coverage of climate reconstructions from temperate low elevation sites in central Europe still exists. This motivated us to concentrate our efforts on the European oak (Quercus robur) in N-Poland. We developed a new robust tree-ring width chronology (TRW), as well as four wood anatomical chronologies (e.g. average vessel area and number of vessels) from Q. robur for the period 1810 to 2010. The chronologies were examined for their climatological responses. While TRW was found to have weak correlations with climate, the earlywood vessel parameters (EVP), especially average vessel area (AVA), revealed significant positive correlations to minimum winter temperatures. Based on stable climate–growth correlations, a reconstruction of minimum winter temperatures (29th November to 20th January) back to 1810 was performed for north Poland. The reconstruction indicates a promising potential to reveal low-frequency climate information. An additional extreme year analysis suggested that in cold winters, a cold–warm–cold pattern in the minimum temperatures was responsible for the relatively small earlywood vessels. Spatial field correlations imply that our reconstruction is more related to temperature variations towards the east of Europe. The reconstructed temperature compared well with two existing temperature reconstructions, especially during most of the 20th century, even though the temperature reconstructions differ spatially and temporally. Based on these findings, the relatively extensive resource of archeological oak material from this region may be useful to perform multicentennial climate reconstructions in the temperate climate zone.","Temperature reconstruction,Poland,Temperate lowlands,Wood anatomy,Dendroclimatology,Earlywood vessel parameter,"
"resource management of maritime edge nodes for collected data feedback","2020","With the development of marine economy, more marine applications emerge leading to more deployed sensors and more generated data. However, current marine Internet only provides low transmission rate constrained by limited communication resources and bad transmission environment. How to efficiently use these resources and guarantee quality-of-service (QoS) of applications need to be addressed. This paper proposes an online optimization resource management algorithm to improve the communication resource efficiency with guaranteed QoSs for different applications. This algorithm needs neither of the resource cost function nor QoS constraint function at the resource scheduling node. Furthermore, the gradient information, which is usually needed in learning strategies, is not required either. Instead, this algorithm performs resource management of both computation and communication resources in each time slot only based on the observation of the last time slot. With slot-by-slot resource allocation, the communication cost can be minimized to be suitable for maritime scenarios. In the meantime, a long-term delay constraint can be satisfied. Results show that the proposed algorithm achieves the goal of reducing communication cost while guaranteeing the delay-constraint of different applications. Although more computation resources will improve its performance, this algorithm still can obtain the minimized cost given a low computation resource.","Image edge detection,marine applications,guaranteed QoSs,long-term delay constraint,quality of service,Delays,time slot,online optimization resource management algorithm,Resource management,gradient information,telecommunication scheduling,resource scheduling node,communication cost minimization,Online resource management,resource cost function,Quality of service,learning strategies,data feedback,optimisation,communication resources,computation resources,low computation resource,communication resource efficiency,edge computing,marine economy,maritime edge nodes,collected data feedback,Bandwidth,quality-of-service,communication cost reduction,current marine Internet,low transmission rate,marine communication,Scheduling,slot-by-slot resource allocation,Internet,resource allocation,maritime communications,QoS constraint function,bad transmission environment,"

"trial results of a new low-cost and covert technology to trace the path of maritime containers worldwide","2008","There are approximately 7 million maritime style containers within Canada, and 70 million within the USA. The interiors of such containers are rarely inspected. With market globalization, a large amount of these containers enter North America on a daily basis. Such containers may include contraband or dangerous items that present an economic or security risk. Despite significant security improvements, only 3 to 5% of the maritime containers, that arrive in or transition through North America, go through physical inspection. Current container tracking technologies based on GPS consume high DC power, are costly, require line-of-sight with satellites and they are often too large to be covert. It is possible to overcome some of these limitations by basing the tracking system on the FM broadcast signal which is an alternative man-made signal that is reasonably ubiquitous, provides a geographically unique frequency spectrum and is about 100,000 as strong as a GPS satellite signal. This allows the development of a low cost, low power and miniature FM receiver that can record frequency spectrums and compare them to known data in order to trace the path that the container has taken for less than 10$ per container. This paper presents the first results of highway trials (train and sea trials are to be conducted in 2009) of such a low cost, covert, non-GPS based technology (called 'FM Tag') that records the worldwide displacement of containers and displays the path undertaken by the container while in transit. As an added security benefit, the tag is also capable of detecting container door openings. In addition to presenting the first trial results, this paper covers the innovative engineering aspects of using the metal enclosure of a maritime container as a VHF antenna, thereby eliminating the need to add an external antenna and achieving the goal of being 100% covert.","Maritime container traceability,Costs,Inspection,low-cost covert technology,Global Positioning System,FM broadcast signal,ships,Containers,alternative man-made signal,high DC power,Maritime container intrusion sensor and Article traceability,Globalization,market globalization,maritime containers path,GPS,Satellite broadcasting,North America,Frequency,Power generation economics,Security,"

"advection pathways at the mt. cimone wmo-gaw station: seasonality, trends, and influence on atmospheric composition","2020","Relationships are analysed between advection pathways and atmospheric composition at the high-mountain station of Mt. Cimone (Italy), between 1998 and 2011. Back-trajectory cluster analysis identifies eight main advection pathways. A connection is demonstrated between the seasonality of airmass transport and atmospheric composition. Temporal trends and correlation of variables, flow types and teleconnection indices show, among other, decreasing trends of 210Pb (a radionuclide of crustal origin; −0.008 mBq m−3 year−1) as well as PM10 (−0.15 μg m−3 year−1), indicating that previously observed downward PM10 trends in Europe may actually be attributable to a combination of meteorological factors and decreasing anthropogenic emissions. The detection of a positive (negative) correlation of these tracers with Western (Arctic) air masses, showing significant downward (upward) trends at the study site, further confirms our findings. Lastly, relationships between teleconnection indices and atmospheric transport types/atmospheric variables are further analysed, focusing on large-scale atmospheric circulation indices and regional low-frequency atmospheric circulation pathways, the Mediterranean Oscillation and the Western Mediterranean Oscillation.

"an investigation on the non-stationarity of flood frequency across the uk","2021","Water infrastructure design and flood mitigation projects are currently based on a so-called stationary assumption. However, this assumption has been challenged in recent years due to increased extreme weather, potentially leading to the underestimation of flood quantiles and an increased risk of structural failures. In the present study, peak flow series from 158 gauging stations in the UK are analysed using both stationary and non-stationary models based on the generalised additive models for location, scale and shape (GAMLSS) framework. Nine candidate covariates are used for non-stationary models to obtain information on the significant drivers of non-stationarity in each flood series. Very few stations are thus found to show temporal trends, which suggests that time-varying non-stationary flood models may not always be suitable, and the use of physically-based covariates can provide better-fitting models. In particular, the non-stationary models using rainfall-related covariates display the best performance for the vast majority of stations, thus suggesting that the variability of the rainfall regime remains the dominant driver for changes in flooding. Moreover, two atmospheric circulation patterns, namely the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the East Atlantic Pattern, were found to be closely related to the non-stationarity of flooding at a number of stations. Unlike rainfall, however, the influence of these climate indices is not particularly dominant; hence, they are more suitably employed as components of a multiple-covariate non-stationary model. Besides, a direct linkage between the variability of flooding and climate changes has not been identified either regionally or globally. For the majority of stations (70%), the use of multiple covariates can provide a better non-stationary model than the use of a single covariate.","Flood frequency analysis,Covariate,Non-stationarity,GAMLSS,UK,"

"collaborative autonomous multi-vessel detection, bounding, and containment for maritime environmental disasters","2017","This paper demonstrates the process of adapting publicly available repositories for the MOOS-IvP middleware to efficiently create and solve problems for collaborative marine autonomy. The problem introduced in this paper addresses a collaborative approach for autonomous environmental anomaly detection, bounding, and containment. An environmental anomaly may be an oil spill, radioactive contamination, or other similar undesirable and detectable event. A simulated oil spill anomaly was introduced into the maritime environment. Multiple autonomous vessels searched an area and discovered the anomaly. Upon detection, one vessel continued to search the larger area for additional spills. The second vessel began a dedicated survey of the spill area to determine the severity, approximate bounding dimensions, and spreading, if any. Upon completing its survey to a reasonable level of confidence, another vessel confirmed the boundary then surrounded the bounded spill area with an oil boom to prevent further spreading. Vessels provided detailed spill reports throughout the survey and bounding process. A final spill report was sent to the shore side control station with the overall dimensions of the spill as well as the location and dimensions of the bounding oil boom that was laid. The vehicles used in this problem were capable of avoiding collision with other marine traffic in accordance with the international collision regulations (COLREGS).","international collision regulations,disasters,bounding process,Search problems,autonomous environmental anomaly detection,Oils,MOOS-IvP middleware,oil pollution,marine safety,bounded spill area,Linear programming,Databases,maritime environmental disasters,object detection,collaborative autonomous multivessel detection,collaborative marine autonomy,Collaboration,marine traffic,Autonomous vehicles,marine pollution,bounding oil boom,spill reports,multiple autonomous vessels,Temperature sensors,vessel,radioactive contamination,simulated oil spill anomaly,oceanographic techniques,"

"in-situ acoustic monitoring of direct energy deposition process with deep learning-assisted signal denoising","2022","In-situ monitoring is crucial for detecting process anomalies and ensuring part quality in additive manufacturing. Acoustic-based monitoring techniques offer extra benefits such as adjustable sensor setup and lower hardware costs. In the direct energy deposition (DED) process, acoustic signals generated by laser-material interactions carry information about underlying complex physical mechanisms such as melting, solidification, crack propagation, and pore formation. This paper presents a novel acoustic-based in-situ monitoring method for the DED process. The raw acoustic signal is made up of laser-material interaction sound as well as noise from machine movement, inert gas flow, and powder flow. A deep learning model is developed to build an end-to-end signal denoising framework to minimize environmental noise and extract the laser-material interaction sound. Audio equalization, bandpass filtering, and Harmonic-Percussive Source Separation algorithm are used to produce a cleaned laser-material interaction sound as the model's ground truth target. Acoustic data is collected from experiments using different DED machines, materials, and varied process parameters to train the deep learning model. The proposed deep learning-assisted signal denoising strategy lays the groundwork for acoustic-based in-situ defect detection of the DED process.","Acoustic Signal Processing,Additive Manufacturing,Direct Energy Deposition,Sound Source Separation,In-situ Monitoring,Deep Learning,"
"maritime moving target detection technique for passive bistatic radar with gnss transmitters","2017","The paper puts forward a moving target detection technique for passive bistatic radar systems based on GNSS signals for maritime surveillance applications. If from one hand navigation satellites are extremely attractive as opportunistic sources for passive radar due to their global coverage and the availability of multiple satellites, on the other hand they provide a restricted power budget. To strengthen the target energy sufficiently to allow its detection, observation time has to be increased up to several tens of seconds. This requires the need to develop innovative techniques able to deal with such long integration times. In this paper, a local plane-based maritime moving target detection (M-MTD) technique is proposed. Such a technique performs the integration of the received signal for a long integration time, properly taking into account the migration of the moving target during the entire dwell time. Moreover, it provides target detection in the local plane that represents the section of maritime area covered by the radar antenna. Since this plane is common to multiple transmitters, the proposed technique can be easily extended to the multistatic case, which is the bigger benefit in using GNSS sources. Simulated and experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed M-MTD technique to detect ship targets, not detectable with conventional MTD techniques, with the GNSS-based passive radar.","Satellites,marine radar,Radar antennas,radar detection,passive radar,M-MTD technique,radar antennas,marine navigation,Transmitters,received signal integration,satellite navigation,target energy,local plane-based maritime moving target detection technique,ship target detection,radar antenna,search radar,Doppler effect,restricted power budget,maritime surveillance applications,Passive radar,Object detection,spaceborne radar,passive bistatic radar system,GNSS transmitters,"

"detecting and quantifying palaeoseasonality in stalagmites using geochemical and modelling approaches","2021","Stalagmites are an extraordinarily powerful resource for the reconstruction of climatological palaeoseasonality. Here, we provide a review of different types of seasonality preserved by stalagmites and methods for extracting this information. A new drip classification scheme is introduced, which facilitates the identification of stalagmites fed by seasonally responsive drips and which highlights the wide variability in drip types feeding stalagmites. This hydrological variability, combined with seasonality in Earth atmospheric processes, meteoric precipitation, biological processes within the soil, and cave atmosphere composition means that every stalagmite retains a different and distinct (but correct) record of environmental conditions. Replication of a record is extremely useful but should not be expected unless comparing stalagmites affected by the same processes in the same proportion. A short overview of common microanalytical techniques is presented, and suggested best practice discussed. In addition to geochemical methods, a new modelling technique for extracting meteoric precipitation and temperature palaeoseasonality from stalagmite δ18O data is discussed and tested with both synthetic and real-world datasets. Finally, world maps of temperature, meteoric precipitation amount, and meteoric precipitation oxygen isotope ratio seasonality are presented and discussed, with an aim of helping to identify regions most sensitive to shifts in seasonality.",""
"demonstrating the effect of exposure to nature on happy facial expressions via flickr data: advantages of non-intrusive social network data analyses and geoinformatics methodologies","2018","Although the role of exposure to nature (ETN) in improving well-being was previously demonstrated, most of the existing research is derived from self-report measures. Conversely, geoinformatics methodologies are seldom used. To address this gap, we examined the prevalence of happy facial expressions (HFE) in natural settings such as water bodies, green vegetation, and undeveloped areas. We applied a novel, spatio-temporal analysis of photos taken in the Boston area and posted on Flickr – a location-based social network – during 2012–2015 (N = 60,013). Photos were analyzed using Microsoft Emotion API to detect facial expressions. ETN, measured either as a composite score, or based on the three aforementioned aspects, was significantly associated with HFEs, even after controlling for temporal patterns. An exploratory visualization of spatial clusters characterized by high HFE proportion was in agreement with the statistical results. This method can be used to explore human-environment interactions more explicitly in a non-intrusive manner.",""
"aerosol characteristics and types in the marine environments surrounding the east mediterranean - middle east (emme) region during the aqaba campaign","2023","This study analyzes the aerosol optical properties (scattering, absorption coefficients, single scattering albedo), supported by chemical composition measurements, in the marine boundary layer of the East Mediterranean – Middle East (EMME) region, aiming to explore the spatio-temporal variability, aerosol mixing state, sources and dominant types. The measurements were taken during the AQABA (Air Quality and climate change in the Arabian Basin) cruise campaign (1st July – September 1, 2017) from the south of France to Kuwait and back. Both scattering and absorption coefficients for PM1 and PM10 particles maximized in the southern Red Sea, due to continental outflow from East Africa, and in the Arabian/Persian Gulf due to enhanced anthropogenic/industrial emissions, leading to 3-fold sulfate concentrations compared to the other regions. The East Mediterranean exhibited moderate aerosol loading, with high scattering Ångström Exponent (SAE) values (1.98, 1.30 for PM1 and PM10, respectively), which increased in the Suez Canal and the Arabian Gulf due to impact from combustion sources. The aerosol over the Gulf of Aden and the West Arabian Sea was dominated by coarse particles (SAE<1), with higher Ca2+ concentrations (dust influence). The absorption Ångström Exponent (AAE) remained close to 1, indicative of black carbon (BC) from fossil fuel combustion, while it increased in regions dominated by dust (Gulf of Aden, Arabian Sea). Contrasting aerosol types were identified between the sub-regions using the SAE vs. AAE classification scheme. The “BC-dominated” type prevailed over the East Mediterranean and Suez Canal, while dust mixtures dominated in the Gulf of Aden and the Arabian Sea. Over the Arabian Gulf, mixing of anthropogenic pollution with marine aerosols formed a type with fine particles and low spectral dependence of absorption (AAE<1). Spectral SSA significantly varied along the ship cruise, while it was used for determination of dust influence in the marine environment.","Marine boundary layer,Mediterranean,Aerosol scattering,Absorption,Aerosol types,Middle East,"
"ship detection using sar and ais raw data for maritime surveillance","2016","This paper studies a maritime vessel detection method based on the fusion of data obtained from two different sensors, namely a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and an automatic identification system (AIS) embedded in a satellite. Contrary to most methods widely used in the literature, the present work proposes to jointly exploit information from SAR and AIS raw data in order to detect the absence or presence of a ship using a binary hypothesis testing problem. This detection problem is handled by a generalized likelihood ratio detector whose test statistics has a simple closed form expression. The distribution of the test statistics is derived under both hypotheses, allowing the corresponding receiver operational characteristics (ROCs) to be computed. The ROCs are then used to compare the detection performance obtained with different sensors showing the interest of combining information from AIS and radar.","Satellites,detection,sensor fusion,marine radar,ship detection,radar detection,Marine vehicles,data fusion,maritime vessel detection method,Synthetic aperture radar,ships,automatic identification system,maritime surveillance,synthetic aperture radar,search radar,binary hypothesis testing problem,Artificial intelligence,SAR raw data,test statistics,receiver operational characteristics,AIS raw data,automatic identification system (AIS),generalized likelihood ratio detector,synthetic aperture radar (SAR),Detectors,multi-sensor fusion,"
"global change and the measurement of absolute sea-level","1987","To quantify properly the long-term response of sea-level to climate change, land motions must be separated from the apparent or relative sea-level change recorded by conventional tide/sea-level gauges. Here we present a concept for global measurement of the true or “absolute” sea-level change, which combines recent advances in space-based geodetic techniques with plans for a global sea-level network under the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP). Data from initial feasibility tests show that land motion, due to global (plate tectonic), regional (glacial rebound), or local (fluid withdrawal) effects, can probably be measured to ±1cm (on a single measurement basis) by an innovative combination of Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) and Global Positioning System (GPS) tevhniques. By making repeated observations of position at a number of tide gauges using portable, economical GPS receivers in a differential mode relative to the fewer, more stable, but more expensive VLBI observatories, it will be possible to subtract land motion from the relative sea-level signal. Decadal to century scale trends at the 1–2mm y−1 level will be resolvable in the sea-level and vertical land motion time series within about a decade. Detection of subsidence or uplift at specific gauges will allow correction for land motion or deletion of bad data when computing regional or global, i.e. eustatic, sea-level changes. In addition to their applications in oceanography and climate studies, such data will test models by Peltier and other that relate mantle viscosity and deglaciation history to present rates of crustal subsidence or uplift. If the predicted crustal motions are confirmed, we can also have more confidence in the use of historical tide/sea-level gauge records in retrospective studies of sea-level change related to climate variability on decadal or longer time scales. It is concluded that as few as one-third (about 100) of the total number of tide/sea-level gauges (250–300) required for global climate research programmes (WYRTKI and PUGH, 1984) need to be upgraded to “sea-level observatory” status, in terms of sensors and geodetic control, to build a two tier sea-level network that will provide the data needed to solve many problems of both relative and absolute sea-level change. Such a network will provide basic information supporting research on a wide range of questions related to “global change”.",""
"maritime vessel route extraction and automatic information system (ais) spoofing detection","2021","Automated Identification System (AIS) comprises of a global real-time network of maritime vessels, transmitters, and satellite or ground-station receivers, which are used to track and record time-stamped static (vessel-id, type, etc.) and dynamic (location, course, speed, etc.) information of all maritime vessels. Traditionally, this data feed has been used by vessel traffic services to avoid vessel collisions, however increasingly, marine researchers and data scientists have shown interest in developing algorithms on historical AIS data-dumps with diverse objectives such as estimating trends in global ocean-currents, maritime logistical planning, fishing fleet monitoring and enhancing maritime security. This paper aims to propose a novel shipping-route extraction algorithm to process historical AIS data (running into tens of gigabytes of daily data, from more than a hundred thousand maritime vessels), to effectively characterize global shipping route behaviour and capture its seasonal trends. This is done by formulating a sigmoid based turning waypoint identification, which does not solely depend on the change in the course of a vessel, derived from AIS message. The AIS data is further processed to excerpt the vesselâ€™s distance from the nearest port and nearest shore with resolution of about 1 km, which forms a handy metric for the identification of suspicious ports. Several other use cases are also explored, which include detecting various anomalies in individual vessel behaviour such as intentional or unintentional switching off AIS transmission, shipping-lane deviations, spoofing transmission messages. To tackle spoofing anomaly, various spoofing identification methods are discussed. A region-based spoofing identification algorithm is developed to identify spoofing points under multiple categories using a clustering algorithm. All the results are visualized through an open-source map overlay. The results contribute to a growing body of fast shipping route analysis algorithms.","Pattern recognition,fleet monitoring,Clustering algorithms,size 1.0 km,Folium,AIS transmission,ground-station receivers,historical AIS data-dumps,maritime vessels,Switches,security of data,maritime security,vessel behaviour,maritime logistical planning,Transmitters,global shipping route behaviour,Turning,logistics,ships,marine safety,Route Extraction,marine engineering,nearest port,Automatic Identification system,Port catalogue,vessel traffic services,automatic information system spoofing detection,Data Mining,shipping-route extraction algorithm,vessel collisions,Artificial intelligence,AIS message,maritime vessel route extraction,time-stamped static,data scientists,spoofing identification methods,AIS spoofing detection,Market research,DBSCAN Clustering Algorithm,fast shipping route analysis algorithms,Data mining,global ocean-currents,Python,nearest shore,marine researchers,"
"an analysis of maritime communications between a ship at sea and a shore station by a ray-based monte carlo method","2017","In this paper, an analysis of maritime communications between a ship at sea and a shore station using a ray-based Monte Carlo method has been proposed. A sea surface is modeled by the one-side Pierson-Moskowitz spectrum. A Monte Carlo method based on a ray tracing is employed to predict the scattering from the temporally evolving rough sea surface for each time step. The maximum of double reflections is restricted in the ray tracing for a practical purpose. The total received signal is the superposition of the direct propagating field and the scattered field by the sea surface. The statistical numerical result is finally obtained by averaging the results from many realizations. Numerical results for the link performance evaluation obtained by the proposed method are illustrated. The results show that the misalignment of transmitting and receiving antennas due to the rolling ship has relatively less impact on the communication link performance than the multipath fading due to the scattering by the temporally evolving rough sea surface.","direct propagating field,Monte Carlo methods,ray tracing,receiving antennas,scattered field,electromagnetic wave propagation,Marine vehicles,Rough surfaces,Transmitting antennas,Scattering,ships,ransmitting antennas,rough sea surface,one-side Pierson-Moskowitz spectrum,Sea surface,Monte Carlo method,transmitting antennas,statistical numerical result,Receiving antennas,communication link performance,Surface roughness,marine communication,shore station,electromagnetic wave scattering,maritime communications,"

Inspired by this motivation, energy harvesting space-air-sea integrated networks (EH-SASINs) for maritime computation tasks offloading are proposed in this paper. We first make the optimal deployment of tethered aerostats (TAs) with the K-means method. In addition, we study the issue of computation task offloading for vessels, focusing on minimizing the process delay of computation task based on the proposed architecture. Finally, because of the NP-hard properties of the optimization problem, we solve it in two stages and propose an improved water-filling algorithm based on queuing theory.

"first comparison of sentinel-1 and terrasar-x data in the framework of maritime targets detection: south italy case","2016","The Sentinel-1A is the first of two satellites that composes the Sentinel-1 radar mission. Both satellites operate a C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) system to give continuity to the European SAR program. SAR is a flexible sensor able to fulfil users/applications requirements in terms of resolution and coverage thanks to different operational modes and polarizations. With the in-orbit availability of very-high-resolution X-band SAR sensors, the Sentinel-1 satellites have been designed to achieve wide coverage at medium to high resolution. The interferometric wide swath (IWS) mode implemented with the terrain observation with progressive scan (TOPS) technique is the standard acquisition mode over European waters and land masses. IWS in dual-polarization (VV/VH) combination offers 250-km swath at 5 m Ã— 20 m (range Ã— azimuth) spatial resolution. These specifications are in line with the needs of the European Maritime and Security Agency (EMSA) for oil spill and ship detection applications included in the CleanSeaNet program. The main goals of this paper are: assessment of medium-to-high-resolution C-band Sentinel-1 data with very-high-resolution X-band TerraSAR-X data for maritime targets detection; synergetic use of multiplatforms satellite SAR data for target features extraction; evaluation of polarimetric target detectors for the available co-polarization and cross-polarization Sentinel-1A IWS VV/VH products.

"mercury concentration and isotopic composition on different atmospheric particles (pm10 and pm2.5) in the subtropical coastal suburb of xiamen bay, southern china","2021","The concentration and isotopic composition of particulate-bound mercury (PBM) on both PM2.5 and PM10 were simultaneously measured (24 months) in a typical subtropical coastal suburb of Xiamen bay (SCXB), southern China. The results showed that most mercury was concentrated in PM2.5 and small particulates enriched heavier isotopes of mercury more than lighter ones. Negative Δ199Hg values and slightly positive Δ200Hg values were observed in both PM2.5 and PM10. PBM input sources were identified with isotopic compositions and meteorological data using the NOAA HYSPLIT model. It revealed that biomass combustion is the main source of particulate mercury in SCXB, and the two other sources are urban anthropogenic emissions and potential marine sources. Seasonal variations in isotopic composition and correlation analysis suggested that PBM in SCXB mainly originate from inland after long-distance transportation in spring and under the influence of oceanic air masses in summer. The Δ199Hg/Δ201Hg ratios in all samples (1.01 ± 0.05, 2SE) indicated that the photoreduction of Hg(II) in the aerosol was the main reaction process of PBM transformation in the atmosphere. Seasonal variations in Δ200Hg values were also found, indicating the possibility of even mass independent fractionation in tracing the mercury sources.","Inhalable particle,Fine particle,Mercury source,Photoreduction,Mercury isotopes,"
"realistic extended target model for track before detect in maritime surveillance","2015","Traditional target tracking algorithms are generally fed a set of thresholded detections under the hypothesis that no more than one detection is generated by each single target. Improvements in modern radar systems have made possible to obtain high resolution data of the targets, making them occupy more than a single resolution cell, and have made necessary to use appropriate Extended Target Tracking (ETT) techniques, since the aforementioned hypothesis is no longer valid. However, these techniques do not often take into account the physical phenomena that are involved in the radar-sea-target system. This paper explores some of the effects involved in the transmission, propagation, backscattering and processing of the radar signal in a maritime environment, that have a crucial importance in ETT.

Although insolation forcing is the primary driver of Holocene hydroclimate changes in Europe on a multimillennial scale, the evaluation of the principal component analysis of speleothem records and correlations with sea surface temperature data indicates that North Atlantic ocean circulation played a significant role in the sub-millennial variation of continental moisture transport, with an increasing importance during the Late Holocene. The combined evaluation of speleothem-based data, climate simulations and sea surface temperature records therefore advances our understanding of the governing processes of Holocene hydroclimate changes in the European and Mediterranean regions.","European and mediterranean regions,Principal component analysis,Holocene hydroclimate,Speleothems,Ocean circulations,Stable isotope compositions,"
"remote sensing of bush fire dynamics in central africa from 1984 to 1988: analysis in relation to regional vegetation and pluviometric patterns","1995","Spatial and temporal subcontinental patterns of fire distribution in Africa, may vary strongly from year to year. These variations may be of climatic or anthropic origin. Global Area Coverage (GAC) data, from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), are known both to provide a good description of fire calendar and on a continental scale, a good indicator of locations of intense fire activity. In fact, the GAC data, available on a daily basis back to July 1981, is the only source of information actually available to determine burning patterns both on a continental scale and over long periods of time. This study presents the spatio-temporal distribution of vegetation fire in Central Africa, as derived from GAC imagery, over the four 1984/85 to 1987/88 dry seasons of the Northern Hemisphere (November to February periods). The analysis of the mean fire distribution patterns over the four dry seasons, as defined by vegetation cover and pluviometric conditions, shows a north to south gradient of fire activity in the savannah domain: This gradient of fire activity has been previously related to the annual pluviometric calendar and the amount of rainfall. The strong interannual variability in fire activity observed for this four-years-period could not, however, be explained by the monthly pluviometric patterns. The observed fire gradient therefore seems to result from additional meteorological or anthropic parameters. The methodology used in this study demonstrates the potential of GAC data for fire monitoring at a subcontinental scale. Current work is extending the area of interest to the entire African continent using the 10-yr-period of GAC imagery.",""
"vessel detection and classification: an integrated maritime surveillance system in the tyrrhenian sea","2010","In recent years a number of organizations, both national and international, have put significant efforts in developing knowledge-based integrated maritime surveillance (IMS) systems. The final aim is to have a clear picture of the position, classification, identification and movement of cooperative and non-cooperative targets entering and leaving the 200 nautical miles limit of the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). Each sensor (i.e. satellite-based, ground-based, shipborne or airborne) has its own task and, in such a context, high frequency (HF) surface wave (SW) radars are inexpensive tools for long range early warning applications in open waters. They allow maximizing the effectiveness in dealing with fisheries protection, drug interdiction, illegal immigration, terrorist threats, search and rescue tasks. This paper focuses on the possibility of combining automatic identification system (AIS) data with HFSWR data for vessel detection and classification purposes. Three algorithms for target detection in compound Gaussian HF sea clutter are presented and their performance evaluated. The combined use of AIS plots provided by cooperative targets can allow the operator to discriminate non-cooperative targets and possible threats. The concurrent exploitation of AIS and HFSWR data is presented and discussed by means of real data recorded during the NURC experiment in the northern Tyrrhenian Sea in May 2009.","marine radar,radar detection,automatic identification system data,radar clutter,target detection,Gaussian HF sea clutter,Marine vehicles,signal classification,HFSWR data,Tyrrhenian sea,Gaussian processes,search radar,vessel detection,cooperative target,high frequency surface wave radar,identification,radar tracking,vessel classification,knowledge-based integrated maritime surveillance system,noncooperative target,exclusive economic zone,"
"rare earth elements and yttrium as tracers of waste/rock-groundwater interactions","2022","Increasing concentrations of Rare Earth Elements (REE) plus yttrium (REY) are entering the environment due to human activities. The similar chemical behaviour across the whole REY, i.e. the lanthanide series (lanthanum to lutetium) and yttrium, allows their use as tracers, fingerprinting rock-forming processes and fluid-rock interactions in earth science systems. However, their use in fingerprinting waste and particularly low-level radioactive waste has not received much attention, despite the direct use of REE in the nuclear industry and the traditional use of REE as proxies to understand the environmental mobility of the actinide series (actinium to lawrencium). The highly instrumented low-level radioactive waste site at Little Forest (Australia) allows a detailed REY study, investigating interactions with local strata, neighbouring waste forms and shallow groundwater flows. Groundwater samples and solids from cored materials were recovered from 2007 to 2012 from the study site and regional baseline sites in the same geological materials. The REY in water samples were analysed by automated chelation pre-concentration (SeaFast, ESI) followed by ICP-MS determination, while solid samples were analysed using Neutron Activation Analysis (NAA) and X-ray fluorescence scanning (ITRAX). Solid rocks showed no REY departed from typical Upper Crust compositions in either Little Forest or regional background sites. Shallow groundwater from ~4–5 m, at or slightly below waste trench levels, showed water-waste interaction as a marked enrichment, relative to shale-normalised patterns, in samarium, europium and gadolinium, with depleted yttrium. Leachate samples from the neighbouring urban landfill show different REY normalised patterns. REY distribution changes with depth through increased interaction with shales and sandstones. Variations in pH and redox conditions lead to widespread precipitation of Fe-hydroxides, which scavenge REY with differential uptake by precipitating solids, resulting in increases in Y and higher Y/Ho ratio in the groundwater along the flow path. Our study revealed that the Little Forest low-level radioactive waste has a REY fingerprint different to that of groundwater in surrounding land uses. REY can be used to fingerprint diverse waste sources, assess the mobility of lanthanides inferring the mobility of selected actinides, and to trace the fate of REY during groundwater recharge. The approach presented can refine source allocation and trace pollutant mobility in current and legacy urban, mixed and radioactive waste sites around the world.","Waste-rock interaction,Rare earth elements and yttrium (REY),Low-level nuclear waste,Landfill,Tritium,Little Forest Legacy Site,"
"organotin compounds in seawater and mytilus galloprovincialis mussels along the croatian adriatic coast","2012","In this work, data on the level of organotin compounds (OTCs) in seawater and mussels collected along the entire Croatian Adriatic Coast are presented. The samples were collected in 2009 and 2010 at 48 locations representing different levels of maritime activities, including marinas, ports and reference sites. Butyltins (BuTs) were found in all analyzed samples, representing >97% of OTCs, and ranged from 0.46 to 27.98ngSnL−1 in seawater and from <6 to 1675ngSng−1 in mussels. The results indicate a recent input of TBT, with the highest concentrations of BuTs found in the marinas. It appears that the Adriatic coast is still polluted with TBT despite the fact that TBT-containing antifouling paints have been banned in Croatia since 2008. It is questionable how much TBT pollution decreased since 2005, when a high incidence of imposex was established in the same area.","Mussels,Seawater,Croatian Adriatic Coast,Tributyltin (TBT),Organotin compounds (OTCs),"

"has egnos its own place in maritime navigation?","2015","GNSS (in fact it usually means GPS) is at the moment the fundamental means of positioning for any variants of navigation. However some attributes of it can be not sufficient for every users or in some tasks, so there are many cases when this system needs support. From the mariner point of view pure GPS properties perfectly fulfils expectations of sailors at the open sea, however there are lot of cases, when accuracy of the system are not sufficient. Besides of accuracy other performance characteristics, for example availability, risk of jamming etc. are important. As the â€œmedicineâ€ for this, differential version of GPS is suggested. At the moment hundreds of DGPS reference stations exist all over the world, but simultaneously other augmentation systems provide services for example European overlay for GPS (European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service - EGNOS). But over 30 years of DGPS use at sea causes that sailors prefer it than EGNOS.At the moment as EGNOS is fully operational, it is time for evaluation of pro and cons of both services in the maritime context. As it was mentioned, at the open waters there is no doubt about GPS usability and in fact DGPS as well as EGNOS are not necessary. In real situation this is anyway impossible because of limited coverage of DGPS. It is truth that EGNOS is accessible on all the seas around Europe, however seamen do not see so far need of such high accuracy of the fixing. However on restricted waters, on approaches to harbours and on river navigation both systems seem to be indispensable, especially because their accuracy. On the other hand observation made with AIS over accuracy of ships' position on Gdanska Bay suggest that problem is not clear. In these waters two DGPS reference stations are available aside from EGNOS. Observation of AIS messages shows, that on the some leg of the route some ships' positioning data are changeover on DGPS when other one DGPS is switched on GPS, and other one does not change accuracy at all. From the other side positions fixed with DGPS at different locations but at a similar distance from Reference Station have noticeable different accuracy. The location of these places suggests the influence of the signal propagation over land on the fixes accuracy. In the paper analysis of different aspects of both systems work are presented as well as their usefulness and limitations are analysed. Finally the advantage of EGNOS over DGPS in marine navigation and field of application of both systems is discussed.","Satellites,Maritime Navigation,Global Navigation Satellite system,GNSS,European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service,Europe,AIS messages,Receivers,jamming,maritime navigation,European overlay,augmentation systems,Satellite broadcasting,DGPS reference stations,EGNOS,marine navigation,Global Positioning System,"
"real-time maritime situation awareness based on deep learning with dynamic anchors","2018","Situation awareness in maritime environment entails early detection and classification of maritime targets of varying sizes, depths, shapes, textures, and contrasts. Thus, this paper describes a novel deep learning based maritime situation awareness approach using high-definition video. Maritime object detection is achieved in three main steps. At first, a key region based tracking algorithm allows to, dynamically and parsimoniously, extract high-quality region proposals mainly focalized around rigid (i.e.; potential object) video locations. The latter are, further, fed into a Fast-RCNN for carrying out objectness detection and box regression. Finally, a mere box post-regression operation enables to extract maritime objects. Furthermore, the found object detections are fed into a second classification RCNN, specifically, trained to recognize up to 40 vessel classes. Our experiments have shown that the proposed approach achieves state of the art speed and accuracy.","real-time maritime situation awareness,object detections,objectness detection,maritime situation awareness approach,high-definition video,key region based tracking algorithm,maritime objects,Streaming media,maritime object detection,regression analysis,Object recognition,neural nets,target tracking,deep learning,object tracking,marine engineering,Proposals,object detection,maritime targets,box post-regression operation,classification RCNN,video signal processing,maritime environment,Deep learning,Object detection,high-quality region proposals,Surveillance,Task analysis,learning (artificial intelligence),dynamic anchors,"
"aligning value creation and sme competitiveness in the export of maritime services: empirical evidence from trinidad and tobago","2023","The multifaceted composition and preponderance of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) participating in the services sector create unique challenges for specialization, productivity, and innovation, particularly in the export of maritime services. Three issues distilled from the literature are (i) servitization of SMEs, (ii) diversification during periods of uncertainty, and (iii) value creation cluster initiatives as a stimulus for enhancing SME competitiveness, in a circular economy. Aligning value creation and SME competitiveness could drive maritime services export. This paper examines whether SME service-providers could improve competitiveness through value creation and cluster initiatives in the export of maritime services in Trinidad and Tobago (T&T). A survey was conducted in the Leisure Marine Services Cluster. Acquired data on five value creation determinants (namely, repair accuracy, concurrent engineering, quality standard, quality assurance, and quality control) were analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS). Empirical evidence shows that repair accuracy and quality standard had positive estimates, with reliability coefficients above 0.70. The application of cluster initiatives would support the development of a value creation program and enhance SMEâ€™s competitiveness in T&T.","Maintenance engineering,Quality control,Boats,Uncertainty,Sociology,Surveys,Technological innovation,"
"a big data approach for fuel oil consumption estimation in the maritime industry","2022","Route optimization has been a research topic for many years in the maritime industry and it constitutes one of the key components to improving energy efficiency and sustainability in ship operations. This paper deals with the challenge of estimating Fuel Oil Consumption (FOC) in the context of Weather Routing (WR). Given a plethora of features collected from the vesselâ€™s Automatic Identification System (AIS) or on-board sensor installations, we examine how a predictive FOC scheme can be coupled with WR optimization algorithms in order to reduce the vesselâ€™s FOC, emissions, and the overall cost of a voyage. In order to handle the amount of data required for FOC prediction, we employ a streaming pipeline that harvests data in real-time from different sources and processes them appropriately for visualization, causal analysis, and forecasting purposes. In this direction, we first conduct an exploratory analysis to examine and unveil the importance and inter-association between the various variables related to sea-keeping and weather features, in order to utilize them effectively in the context of a FOC predictive scheme. Furthermore, we introduce a novel recurrent neural network architecture that approximates ideally the underlying function describing the features and the vesselâ€™s FOC by taking into account historical data, and we showcase the results. Finally, we demonstrate how the FOC prediction model can be coupled with a WR algorithm to propose the optimal route for a vessel in terms of FOC efficiency.","big data collection,recurrent neural nets,sustainability,recurrent neural network architecture,sea-keeping weather features,Prediction algorithms,fuel oil consumption,WR optimization,Recurrent neural networks,Industries,recurrent neural networks,causal analysis,ship operations,information processing,weather routing,exploratory analysis,vessel data,fuel oil consumption estimation,Oils,ships,automatic identification system,energy efficiency,AIS,optimal route,optimisation,sea-keeping,fuel economy,Big Data,petroleum,on-board sensor installations,Routing,energy consumption,shipbuilding industry,energy conservation,route optimization,maritime industry,weather routing optimization,vessel,production engineering computing,Fuels,FOC prediction,"
"maritime targets velocity estimation in space-based passive multistatic radar using long integration times","2021","Target detection by means of space-based passive radar sensors generally requires the adoption of long integration time strategies to reinforce sufficiently the signal strength. These are usually based on the recovery of the target Doppler-rate to cope with the range and Doppler migration experienced over the long dwell considered. In this work, we put forward a Taylor-series approach that capitalizes on the set of bistatic Doppler-rates estimated in Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS)-based multistatic radar configurations to estimate the velocity of ship targets with increased accuracy with respect to conventional Doppler-based procedures. Both the cases of single-element and array receiver configurations have been considered. Theoretical and numerical results under different use cases show as leveraging on the long integration times adopted at the detection stage could significantly increase the accuracy of the estimated ship velocity components. Few experimental results are also provided, verifying the potentialities of the proposed approach in operative scenarios of practical interest for this technology. The proposed approach is not limited at the GNSS case, but it could be potentially applied to any multistatic passive radar system.","Satellites,estimated ship velocity components,Taylor-series approach,space-based passive radar sensors,Radar antennas,target detection,passive radar,Marine vehicles,signal strength,ship velocity estimation,detection stage,long integration time strategies,maritime targets velocity estimation,multistatic passive radar system,satellite navigation,single-element,GNSS-based radar,maritime surveillance,Global Navigation Satellite Systems-based multistatic radar configurations,object detection,ship targets,array receiver configurations,long integration times,space-based passive multistatic radar,target Doppler-rate,bistatic Doppler-rates,GNSS case,radar receivers,Radar,radar tracking,multistatic radar,Doppler radar,Passive radar,conventional Doppler-based procedures,Spaceborne radar,Estimation,Doppler migration,"
"twelve years of geophysical research in the charlevoix seismic zone","1988","Various and extensive geophysical monitoring began in 1974 in the Charlevoix Seismic Zone (CSZ). The historical record and a major earthquake in 1925 characterize this zone as the likely site of a future damaging earthquake (i.e. M = 5.5 or larger) and the aim of the monitoring was to develop the capability of predicting such earthquakes. The parameters studied included: microseismicity, seismic travel times, electrical impedance, vertical movement, horizontal movement, tilt, gravity change, and strain through water well level changes. Although no clear precursor was detected in the months before the largest seismic event that occurred during the observation period (M = 5.0), the multiparameter experiment provided new insights into the structure and the mechanics of this active region. Observations of several hundred well-located microearthquakes have permitted the delineation of ancient rift faults that are now being activated by high horizontal compression. The geographical extent of the zone is sharply defined by the microseismicity which occurs in an area of 35 km × 80 km straddling the St. Lawrence River. Observation of P-waves from accurately-timed explosions and S-waves from earthquakes support the hypothesis of Extensive Dilatancy Anisotropy (EDA) involving saturated parallel cracks in the crust. The data have permitted an estimate of both crack density and the direction for the principal compressive stress in the region (N 30° E). Changes in electrical parameters with periods of months to years were detected at five of the six magnetotelluric stations installed in the region. Changes in the polarization angle of the earth's electrical (telluric) field correlated well (for seven years) with calculated groundwater accumulation levels at one site. Electric impedance changes showed no clear correlation from station to station, but changes at one station appear to correlate with a seismic P-wave travel time change anomaly and with the disappearance of a negative gravity anomaly at the time of an unusual number of earthquakes in the range M = 2 to 3 from mid 1976 to mid 1977. It is suggested that these correlated changes could be related to aseismic stress redistribution and fluid flow along one of the NE striking rift faults about two years before theM = 5.0 earthquake in 1979. Continuous monitoring of tilt (surface and borehole) and well-water levels was carried out at a single site (Charlevoix Geophysical Observatory). Although there were unexplained near-surface tilts of the order of the earth tide amplitude within two or three days before some earthquakes, they were either not spatially coherent or were related to small unexplained temperature changes in the tiltmeter vault. No intermediate-term (one week to one year) precursors were seen against a noise level of 1–3 μrad (RMS) for near-surface tilt observations and a noise level of 0.2–0.3 μrad (RMS) for borehole tilt measurements at a depth of 50–100 m. The threshold of detectable tidal tilt admittance changes for the borehole tiltmeters was lowered to 2% but no significant changes were seen. Four coseismic changes in the levels of water in boreholes were observed (all were drops in water level) which were much larger than expected on the basis of elastic dislocation theory. It is suggested that these could be explained either by the collapse of a dilatant zone around the respective hypocentres or by triggered aseisnuc movement on a nearby active fault. Borehole water level tides observed from 1980 to 1986 exhibit significant variations in amplitude and phase which are thought to be the result of time-varying elastic properties in a nearby structure. Some constraints can now be placed on the long-term deformation of the CSZ as a whole from tiltmeter, levelling and horizontal surveys. Data from a levelling array observed from 1976 to 1986 puts a limit of 0.54 μ rad/yr on the secular tilt rate at the observatory: a further limit of 0.1 μ rad/yr is provided by borehole tilt measurements over the period 1983–1986. A limit of 2 cm is placed on vertical movements northwest of the St. Lawrence River by levelling surveys in 1965, 1978, 1980 and 1982. No significant (90% confidence) deviatoric strain has been detected across the CSZ from horizontal control surveys carried out in 1912–1919, 1965, 1978 and 1983: the maximum allowable long-term strain rate across the CSZ from 1919 to 1983 is 0.16 μ strain/yr.",""
"a multi-proxy reconstruction of tropical cyclone variability during the past 800 years from robinson lake, nova scotia, canada","2018","This study presents a multi-proxy reconstruction of tropical cyclone (TC) activity for the past 800 years from Robinson Lake, located on the north Atlantic seaboard of Nova Scotia, Canada. Two sediment cores were extracted from Robinson Lake and were dated by 210Pb and 14C methods, and analyzed for organic matter content, sediment grain size, and a range of elements and elemental ratios determined by XRF core scanning. A distinct sand layer in the most recent sediments is attributed to Hurricane Juan, which struck the coast of Nova Scotia on September 29, 2003. Our study shows that peaks in grain size farther down-core are generally correlated with abrupt increases in Br and Br/Ti. XRF-derived Br measurements are an indicator of marine organic carbon (MOC), and the increases in Br likely reflect incursions of marine water and nutrients into the lake as a result of storm surges. The results show that the period from ~1475 to 1670 CE contains at least 3–4 storm beds, and are interpreted as the most active TC period within the last ~800 years for this region. Our results are consistent with recent research from Salt Pond, Massachusetts (Donnelly et al. 2015), which provides evidence for heightened TC activity during the same period as our study at Robinson Lake. Our study represents one of the highest latitude paleotempestological studies from the North Atlantic basin which will help the testing of hypotheses concerning long-term changes in North Atlantic TC activity under future climate change scenarios.","X-ray fluorescence,Grain size analysis,North Atlantic,Tropical cyclones,Paleotempestology,"
"mid-cretaceous sequence stratigraphy and sedimentary cyclicity in the western paris basin","1992","Cenomanian and Turonian depositional patterns of the western Paris Basin are interpreted in terms of sequence stratigraphy. A system tract analysis of the epicontinental “Normandie Basin”, with pelagic chalks, and of the “Maine Platform” covered by clastics, provides evidence for relative changes in coastal onlap; various minor uncomformities are related to these changes of sea level. The four global cycles (UZA or ZC-2.2/2.5) of Haq et al. (1987, 1988) are recognised while an additional one is proposed for the Geslinianum Zone. In addition, periodic rhythmic cycles are commonly registered within the chalk, expressed by the repitition of various facies enhanced both by biosedimentary processes and diagenetic alteration. These elementary climatic cycles allow accurate lithostratigraphic correlations. During this period when the sea level peaked on the tectonically passive border of the Armorican block, the Paris Basin appears to record a detailed set of events which can be correlated with those in the Atlantic, Boreal and Tethyan provinces.

"measurement campaign and mathematical model construction for the ship zodiak magnetic signature reproduction","2021","The paper presents the partial work done within the framework of the EDA Siramis II project focused on magnetic signature reproduction of ships. Reproduction is understood here as the ability to determine the magnetic anomaly of the local Earth magnetic field in any direction and at any measurement depth due to the presence of the analysed object. The B-91 type hydrographic ship Zodiak was selected as the real case study. The work was divided into two main stages: the development of a measurement campaign taking into account physical measurements, and the development of a mathematical model on the basis of the measured values. The measurement campaign included: preparation of the measuring range, selection of equipment for the measurement of magnetic quantities and geographical location, and data recording while the ship passes the measuring point according to the designated course. As a result of the measurement campaign, magnetic flux density components were collected in different positions in relation to the measuring instruments and the ship's heading. A multi-dipole model was used to build the mathematical model in accordance with the idea of inverse modelling. The effectiveness of this model was previously checked on synthetic data of virtual ships generated using the finite element method. Experiments performed with simulation models were helpful in determining the structure of the model, the nature of the data, and the number of samples needed to properly determine the multi-dipole model parameters. The parameters were determined using the nonlinear least squares method according to the idea of data fitting. The classical Ridge and Lasso regularization methods were applied to prevent the developed multi-dipole model from overfitting. Other regularization methods based on GPS accuracy marks and modification of fitness functions were also considered. The verification was done using real data: the data generated by the model was compared with patterns recorded during the Zodiak measurement campaign. High degree of conformity of the shape of characteristics was obtained. Moreover, the correctness of model execution was confirmed by low values of quantitative indices such as RMSE and MAE representing modelling errors. The methodology presented in the paper is quite universal and can be used to determine the signatures of other ferromagnetic objects.","Sea measurements,Magnetic anomaly detection,Magnetic variables measurement,Magnetic signatures,Model checking,Electromagnetic modelling,Marine vehicles,Magnetic fields,"
"insights from archaeological analysis and interpretation of marine data sets to inform marine cultural heritage management and planning of wave and tidal energy development for orkney waters and the pentland firth, ne scotland","2014","The Orkney archipelago has a rich heritage that includes the Heart of Neolithic Orkney World Heritage Site, Viking settlements, harbours supplying Hudson's Bay Company ships, and the wartime naval base of Scapa Flow. This rich history has left its mark on the seabed but accurate maps showing the location and character of surviving seabed archaeology do not exist to the same extent as for archaeology on land. ORCA Marine was commissioned by Historic Scotland to work with the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland in interrogating marine data sets to enhance historic environment records of Orkney Waters and the Pentland Firth. These waters were prioritised for their history of maritime activity and to help guide planning and developments in an area highlighted by the Scottish Government for marine renewable energy. A variety of recent and legacy datasets, including wreck databases; sonar data gathered by public sector bodies; aerial photography; seabed cores; Admiralty charts; and local knowledge, were examined for their effectiveness in discovering and interpreting marine cultural heritage cost-effectively. A methodology was developed that enabled marine cultural heritage information to be quickly assimilated within the national and regional inventories for dissemination online. Polygonisation of records resulted in GIS-based shapefiles identifying site extents, and areas of archaeological potential in relation to wrecks, submerged prehistoric landscapes, anchorages and fishing areas. Substantial gaps in data coverage were identified and areas of the seabed have been surveyed at resolutions that are sufficient to detect large upstanding remains such as iron shipwrecks but insufficient to identify smaller archaeological features. Other geophysical datasets have been created at a resolution detailed enough to allow the recognition of smaller anomalies but in some cases processing of the data has removed small anomalies of interest to archaeologists. Intensively used marine areas often contain the most artefactual remains such as historic ports being developed to service the marine renewable industry. Zones of high wave and tidal energy favoured for renewable energy devices include navigation channels and hazards where a large number of wrecks are documented. Transmission cable routes cross deep water where 20th-century wartime losses occurred. Planning and development of infrastructure relating to renewables may also interact with significant built heritage and archaeology on the foreshore and coast edge.",""

"large area monitoring with a modis-based disturbance index (di) sensitive to annual and seasonal variations","2009","Disturbance of the vegetated land surface, due to factors such as fire, insect infestation, windthrow and harvesting, is a fundamental driver of the composition forested landscapes with information on disturbance providing critical insights into species composition, vegetation condition and structure. Long-term climate variability is expected to lead to increases in both the magnitude and distribution of disturbances. As a consequence it is important to develop monitoring systems to better understand these changes in the terrestrial biosphere as well to inform managers about disturbance agents more typically captured through specific monitoring programs (such as focused on insect, fire, or agricultural conditions). Changes in the condition, composition and distribution pattern of vegetation can lead to changes in the spectral and thermal signature of the land surface. Using a 6-year time series of MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Land Surface Temperature (LST) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) data we apply a previously proposed Disturbance Index (DI) which has been shown to be sensitive to both continuous and discontinuous change. Using Canada as an example area, we demonstrate the capacity of this Disturbance Index to monitor land dynamics over time. As expected, our results confirm a significant relationship between area flagged as disturbed by the index and area burnt as estimated from other satellite sources (R2=0.78, p<0.0001).

Further, on a regional basis the DI produces change information matching measured wide-area moisture conditions (i.e., drought) and corresponding agricultural outputs. These findings indicate that for monitoring a large area, such as Canada, the time series based DI is a useful tool to aid in change detection and national monitoring activities.","Insect,Disturbance,Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI),Land Surface Temperature (LST),Drought,Coarse spatial resolution,Disturbance Index (DI),MODIS,Fire,"
"case analysis and cfd numerical study on gas explosion and damage processing caused by aging urban subsurface pipeline failures","2019","The overall targets of this study are to focus on a comprehensive summary of the East Harlem gas explosion in Manhattan, New York. To investigate how the tragedy occurs in the neighborhood of Manhattan and how it influences the probability and the scale of this accident causing corresponding damages. CFD numerical simulations were performed to study explosion characteristics of natural gas leakage and the explosion based on the realistic accident scenario. The gas dispersion, blast wave and flame propagation process were analyzed, the simulated results agreed well with actual destruction in real accident. It further verified the location and the reasons of the ignition sources in the actual event. Moreover, a series of post-accident testing and inspections were undertaken on the accident scene, followed by an in-depth analysis of the causes. This accident highlights the potential hazards of aging urban subsurface infrastructure in such historic metropolis, which especially targets at aging pipes. It is intended to prompt a serious discussion concerning the outmoded technology, overburdened lines, maintenance programs and future risk management, which must be properly managed by authorities if NYC is to remain a dominant global urban destination.","CFD simulation,Aging subsurface infrasructure,Explosion accident,Pipeline failure,Post-accident investigation,"
"detection of invalid ais messages using machine learning techniques","2022","Coastal nations monitor maritime activities in the interest of defence, security, and safety. This form of monitoring typically occurs at operations centers that visualize the maritime environment by creating a Recognized Maritime Picture (RMP) covering a particular area of interest. The creation of this picture changed drastically with the introduction of the Automatic Identification System (AIS). AIS messages are known to contain numerous types of errors and in April 2020 a unique error was found in the data stream. This error consisted of messages indicating the appearance of over 200 vessels in the North Atlantic taking part in a yacht race when in fact no race or physical ships existed. The following work explores the application of various machine learning (ML) techniques to help identify these types of fabricated AIS messages. Specific ML techniques were explored including: K-means clustering, Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Feed-Forward Neural Networks (FNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and One-Class Support Vector Machines (One-SVM). The results showed that DT, RF, and FNN best identified the fabricated AIS messages with F1 scores greater than 93 percent on the test data.","maritime domain awareness,AIS,automatic identification system,machine learning,"

In the maritime sector, intentional interfering signals might induce poor performance of the GNSS receivers, that, in severe cases, are unable to provide reliable measurements. On board of vessels, the failure of the GNSS receiver propagates to multiple systems, like the Automatic Information System (AIS) transponder, the ship's gyro calibration system and the digital selective calling system. The AIS itself can suffer from failures due to interference in the VHF band, and the lack of bandwidth makes it difficult to introduce security any security mechanisms. The vulnerability to intentional interference as well as the availability of personal privacy devices easily sold over the Internet motivate attackers who intend to fraud services and get direct benefits.","fraud services,ship gyro calibration system,GNSS receivers,transponders,Marine vehicles,TRITON project,digital selective calling system,security mechanisms,marine navigation,Global Positioning System,robust navigation,VHF band,interference suppression,intentional spoofing,positioning systems,intentional interfering signals,Ship Reporting Systems,ships,satellite navigation,automatic information system,Jamming,interference mitigation,maritime domain,radiofrequency interference,vessels,Robustness,AIS transponder,calibration,marine communication,Receivers,failure analysis,radio receivers,Interference,maritime sector,personal privacy devices,Internet,Global Navigation Satellite System,Security,security,intentional jamming,"

"spatio-temporal analysis of aerosol optical depth using rotated empirical orthogonal function over the maritime continent from 2001 to 2020","2022","The deterioration in the annual air quality of the Maritime Continent (MC) is mainly caused by biomass burning haze (BBH) and the surrounding atmospheric conditions. This study aims to investigate the spatial and temporal variations of the aerosol optical depth (AOD) and its relationship with biomass burning and climate anomaly factors in the MC from 2001 to 2020. Using aerosol model reanalysis products from the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA-2), values of the aerosol optical depth (AOD) over the MC were collected and processed to obtain a better understanding of the characteristics of the aerosol loading over the MC. Using the varimax rotated empirical orthogonal function (REOF) approach, we assess the spatio-temporal distributions of the AOD over the MC from 2001 to 2020. The REOF maximized the variances explained for the primary modes and has shown clearer relationship between the spatiotemporal patterns of identified modes. The first three REOF modes of the AOD accounted for a total variance of 73.7%. The first mode (REOF1) explaining 35.8% is the main mode that represent fire burning that concentrated over the 0° latitude. REOF1 represents the emission from burning activities which primarily occurred in the Kalimantan and Sumatra based on their correlation with the total hotspots, which reach 0.73, which a certain extent of correlation with the climate anomalies, including El Niño, positive DM, and their coincidence. The second (REOF2) also explaining 35.8% represents the AOD distribution influenced by the biomass burning emission transported from the Indochina in the area to the north of 5°N which has an opposite mode with the general mode in MC except for Java area. Meanwhile, PC3 AOD has reduced to 2.2% in the rotation process and represent the influence of monsoon movement on the AOD level. In short, the study highlights spatial and temporal AOD distribution and the phenomena of burning mass and climate indices in the long-term MERRA reanalysis dataset to allow more understanding of the causal links of AOD in MC to the climate features.","Indian ocean dipole,Aerosol optical depth,El Niño southern oscillation,Maritime continent,"
"integrated characterization of ancient burial mounds using ert and limited drillings at the hepu han tombs, in coastal area of southern china","2019","The Hepu Han Tombs, located on the south coast of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, in southern China, bordering the Beibu Gulf, can date back to the Han dynasty (206 BCE–220 CE), when Hepu was an important international trade port of the maritime Silk Road, spreading strong and persistent cultural influence to neighboring countries from ancient China, and also connecting China with African, European and other Asian countries in national migration, religious communication, political, trade, technical and cultural exchanges, and so on. The research of the Hepu Han Tombs can offer opportunities to understand the burial customs and the Han culture in the Chinese Han Dynasty. With the aim of detecting the location, depth and geometry of two burial mounds at Jinjiling Site of Hepu Han Tombs, an electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) survey was performed in cooperation with archaeological team to calibrate the results with detailed information from the limited drillings in the area. Besides, series of 2-D ERT sections, acquired above the larger mound, were combined into a “Pseudo 3-D” volume, and iso-resistivity surfaces were further calculated to emphasize the location and lateral variations within the data volume, expected towards a more detailed and quantitative interpretation. Both the 2-D and 3-D resistivity imaging gave a clear evidence of structural details of the burial mounds. The results have shown a general consistency between the geophysical work and traditional archaeological drilling explorations, improving our knowledge on the un-excavated mounds, and allowing detailed pre-excavation plan at the Hepu Han Tombs.","Burial mounds,Hepu Han Tombs,Electrical resistivity tomography (ERT),Drillings,"
"ldsn: localization scheme for double-head maritime sensor networks","2014","Ocean covers nearly 71% of our planet's surface, yet 95% of the ocean remains unexplored by human being, and wireless sensor networks are envisioned to perform monitoring tasks over the large portion of our world. However, deploying wireless sensor networks on the sea poses many challenges and for maritime surveillance security applications we may need to deploy sensors both on the sea surface and underwater for three-dimensional detection. In this paper, we propose a hybrid ocean sensor networks called Double-head maritime Sensor Networks (DSNs), which combine the advantages of wireless sensor networks and underwater acoustic sensor networks. By leveraging the unique characteristics of DSNs, we design a localization scheme LDSN which is consisted of two algorithms SML and FLA. We first use SML to localize moored anchor nodes as seed nodes. After the underwater sensor networks have been localized, the floating double-head nodes can figure out its instant position via FLA algorithm. We evaluate the scheme by simulations and the results show that the scheme can achieve a high localization accuracy.","seed node,Wireless Sensor Networks,wireless sensor network,Wireless sensor networks,hybrid ocean sensor network,three-dimensional detection,underwater acoustic sensor network,maritime surveillance security application,sensor placement,wireless sensor networks,floating double-head node,Sea surface,FLA algorithm,LDSN,Tides,Underwater acoustics,moored anchor node,marine communication,Localization,Surveillance,double-head maritime sensor network,SML,Underwater Sensor Networks,localization scheme,"
"spectrum sensing for cognitive maritime vhf networks","2014","The Automatic Identification System (AIS) is used worldwide as a maritime system for identifying and locating vessels by exchanging data in Very High Frequency (VHF) band with other nearby ships, AIS base stations and satellites. It is an important system for safety of navigation to assist collision avoidance and enables marine traffic supervision and management. However, the expanding use of AIS band by other emerging applications and services has caused significant increase on the maritime VHF Data Link (VDL) load, hampering smooth exchange of critical AIS information. Instead of assigning new frequency resources for new marine VDL services, in this paper we present a solution to overcome this spectrum scarcity issue by utilizing Cognitive Radio (CR) technology in maritime AIS VHF network. A preliminary analysis of the performance of such an approach is carried out taking into account the different properties and challenges of marine communication channels due to sea surface movement. The outcome of our study shows how the application of CR techniques to maritime VDL indeed represents an appealing alternative to static spectrum allocation schemes to deal with overloading issues in AIS networks.","spectrum scarcity issue,Sea level,cognitive radio,static spectrum allocation schemes,Marine vehicles,radio spectrum management,VHF band,Transceivers,very high frequency band,automatic identification system,cognitive radio technology,maritime VHF data link load,Cognitive radio,sea surface movement,marine communication channels,cognitive maritime,signal detection,Fading,marine communication,maritime AIS VHF network,spectrum sensing,Detectors,"
"high-squint sar imaging of maritime ship targets","2022","High-squint synthetic aperture radar (HS-SAR) imaging technology greatly enhances the flexibility of SAR. However, the existing HS-SAR imaging algorithms are generally based on the assumption that the illuminated target is static during the synthetic aperture formation. As a consequence, the state-of-the-art algorithms are unable to focus on moving targets well, thus leading to displaced and blurred images of the targets. A maritime ship is a typical kind of moving target with complex noncooperative motion, which has received much attention. Thus, it is a difficult but valuable issue to study HS-SAR imaging of ship targets. In this work, the influence of ship translation and fluctuation is theoretically analyzed. On the basis of these analyses, the new conception of â€œthird range compression (TRC)â€ caused by ship translation is proposed, and the squint minimization (SM) operation is implemented for the compensation of TRC. Moreover, considering that the target Doppler parameters induced by ship fluctuation are related to its position, a novel method called WASH-CLEAN (watershed and CLEAN) is proposed to automatically focus ship scattering points with different swings. Finally, we propose an integrated modified range-Doppler (RD) imaging algorithm by combining the advantages of HS-SAR and inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR).

"change detection support for supervisory controllers of highly automated systems: effects on performance, mental workload, and recovery of situation awareness following interruptions","2018","Dynamic Positioning (DP) is a computer-controlled process to automatically keep a floating vessel at a specific position or to follow a pre-defined path (tracking) by using its own propellers and thrusters. The human supervisory controller has no direct need to constantly know what the status is of all parts of the automation and the system it is controlling, because the highly automated DPS is controlling all components itself. Only after a failure arises, the operator needs to take over manual control and take appropriate action(s) to prevent the failure from harming the operation. As the supervisory controller may be out of the loop, swiftly taking over control may be problematic when failures arise. The purpose of the current study was to investigate whether automation of change detection enables human operators with low awareness of the automation and the system it is controlling to quickly recover awareness in emergency take-over situations. A 2 by 2 within subjects experiment was conducted using a DP simulation (n = 22). Within-subjects factors were support (Yes, No) and interruption (Yes, No). Results showed that change detection support helps in the process of recovering situation awareness after it has been reduced, due to an interruption of the primary task of overseeing the automation. Interestingly, support was not beneficial to the participants in all conditions. In non-interrupted conditions the support unexpectedly resulted in higher workload, raising questions whether supervisory controllers should be supported continuously or only when it is required. Relevance to industry: The results show that change detection support has potential value in operational maritime environments, especially in situations where the DP operator has low situation awareness. Future research should investigate whether adaptive aiding could alleviate some of the negative effects of non-adaptive operator support in maritime environments.","Management-by-exception,Situation Awareness Recovery (SAR),Dynamic positioning,Human-automation collaboration,Out-of-the-loop (OOTL) performance problem,"
"context-enhanced vessel prediction based on ornstein-uhlenbeck processes using historical ais traffic patterns: real-world experimental results","2014","Traffic route analysis and prediction are both essential for maritime security. Specifically, the prediction of a vessel position is useful to provide alerts about upcoming events (e.g., opportunities and threats). However, accurate prediction along a route in the maritime domain is a challenging task, due to the complex and dynamic nature of traffic patterns. This paper presents a vessel prediction method, based on the popular Ornstein-Uhlenbeck stochastic processes, whose parameters are estimated from historical patterns of life. The historical traffic routes are obtained by pre-processing Automatic Identification System (AIS) data via the CMRE tool called Traffic Route Extraction for Anomaly Detection (TREAD). These recurrent routes allow prediction of the position of a vessel that is following one of these routes, surprisingly, by several hours. The method is validated using a case study related to the second data campaign of the EC FP7 Project New Service Capabilities for Integrated and Advanced Maritime Surveillance (NEREIDS)1.

"estimating the effect of decision deviation spreading in networked synergetic emergency decision-making environment: a case study on maritime accident disposition","2019","The generation and propagation of human error will have a great impact on the decision-making in emergency environment. The analysis of the model and mechanism of human error and its propagation is of great significance to the study of emergency decision-making. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a decision failure model based on confidence rule (BRB) reasoning. Individual decision-making is taken as a node in workflow, and the network workflow among decision-making units is examined in a larger scope by establishing the interactive network between nodes. On this basis, the control model of human decision-making errors is further constructed, including the accumulation, transmission and correction of decision-making errors. Finally, taking maritime emergency rescue as an example, this paper studies the capability of the fault control model to identify and correct faults in the decision-making workflow. The research shows that the model can describe the degree of decision deviation of the decision-making unit, and reflect the control and correction function of the decision workflow on the decision error to some extent.","workflow,marine accidents,maritime accident disposition,Transportation,emergency management,decision failure model,Marine vehicles,networked synergetic emergency decision-making environment,confidence rule reasoning,Organizations,human factors,decision deviation,Decision making,interactive network,Accidents,decision-making workflow,maritime emergency rescue,decision making,fault control model,human error,decision error,human decision-making errors,human error control,fault tolerant control,Belief rule base,Cognition,Task analysis,maritime decision-making,marine control,"
"a task offloading scheme in maritime edge computing network","2023","Maritime communication network is affected by many factors such as meteorological environment, resource constraints, communication distance, and so on, resulting in task packet loss, failure, and node overload when the task is offloaded and executed.

With delay and energy consumption as constraints, the revenue function for task offloading path is designed. The function comprehensively considers network resources, channel transmission and node execution ability, thereby achieving the reliable task offloading.

"inter-annual variability of net ecosystem productivity for a temperate mixed forest: a predominance of carry-over effects?","2018","This study presents twenty years of Net Ecosystem Productivity estimations obtained using eddy covariance in a mixed forest, dominated by beech with sparse conifers, at the Vielsalm station, in the Belgian Ardennes. First the quality and reliability of the data set is discussed. An uncertainty analysis showed that if, on one hand, the site heterogeneity and set-up changes may strongly affect yearly NEP estimates, questioning thus the total carbon budget relevance, on the other hand, robust inter-annual anomalies may be obtained as long as a site dedicated data treatment is carefully applied. A validation of the anomalies by comparison with a growth index derived from tree ring measurements is given. The resulting anomalies (range: [−206; + 123] g C m−2 yr−1, standard deviation: 93 g C m−2 yr−1) being larger than their own uncertainty (∼30 g C m−2 yr−1), an inter-annual variability analysis is possible. This analysis shows that the sources of NEP inter-annual variability at the Vielsalm station are multiple but the most prominent causes are biotic processes driven by carry-over effects of preceding meteorological events. The lowest observed NEP, in 2000, resulted from a bark beetle attack probably prompted by an early frost event in 1998. Besides, the robust lagged correlation between NEP anomalies and mean vapor pressure deficit during the preceding vegetation season also suggests a carry-over effect of water limitation during the previous year on the beech NEP. Mechanisms driving this carry-over effect are supposedly linked to tree physiology, which is confirmed by a dependency of canopy photosynthetic capacity to previous year water limitation. Some hypotheses, involving biomass allocation and bud formation, are proposed to explain its lagged impact on canopy photosynthetic capacity. Other causes of NEP inter-annual variability are the radiation during the current vegetation season and the temperature at the end of the winter but the latter variable rather indicates an effect on the conifers interspersed in the plot. Overall, the photosynthetic capacity combined with these two factors explained about 75% of NEP inter-annual variability.","Eddy covariance,Net Ecosystem Productivity,Interannual variability,Forest ecosystem,"

"bio-inspired topology control mechanism for autonomous underwater vehicles used in maritime surveillance","2013","Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are increasingly used in maritime applications to acquire underwater information. With the guidance of intelligent topology control algorithms, AUVs adjust their positions efficiently such that they achieve desired underwater wireless sensor network (UWSN) configurations. A suitable application can be using AUVs in surveillance tasks, where they uniformly spread throughout a harbor entry or around a large civilian or military maritime vessel (e.g., an aircraft carrier) to detect any hostile or unexpected underwater intrusions. Since geographical characteristics are different for each port (shape, depth, etc.) and underwater currents constantly change, manually controlling underwater vehicles for these tasks is not feasible. In this paper, we present a particle swarm optimization (PSO) based topology control mechanism, called 3D-PSO, for AUVs operating in unknown 3D underwater spaces. 3D-PSO uses limited information collected from an AUV's neighborhood to make movement decisions over an unknown 3D space. Each AUV, using our 3D-PSO, is able to adjust its movement speed and direction to achieve a better location towards obtaining a uniform distribution.

This concept involves utilizing the L1 tracking to perform L2/L3 data fusion, i.e. refinement and assessment for situations and threats.

The purpose of the ConTracker is to incorporate the contextual information into a traditional alpha - beta tracker in such a way so that it provides a repeller or an attractor characteristics to a specific region of interest. Any behavior of the vessel that is inconsistent with the repeller or the attractor characteristics of the current vessel location would be classified as suspicious. Such an inconsistent vessel behavior would be directly indicated by a high measurement residual which may be used to estimate an accurate process noise covariance using a multiple-model adaptive estimator.

"combining fm broadcast, accelerometers, ieee 892.15.4 wireless and gps to secure maritime containers worldwide","2010","There are approximately 50 million maritime style containers entering and leaving ports in North America every year and 500 millions worldwide [8]. The interiors of such containers are rarely inspected. With market globalization, a large amount of these containers enter North America on a daily basis. Such containers may include contraband or dangerous items that present an economic or security risk. Despite significant security improvements, only 3 to 5% of the maritime containers, that arrive in or transition through North America, go through physical inspection. Current container tracking technologies solely based on GPS consume high DC power, are costly, require line-of-sight with satellites and they are often too large to be covert. It is possible to overcome some of these limitations by combining GPS with a tracking system based on the FM broadcast signal. Digital FM broadcast is an alternative man-made signal that is ubiquitous, provides a geographically unique frequency spectrum and is about 100,000 as strong as a GPS satellite signal. The combination of GPS and FM, called 'Broadcast Assisted GPSâ„¢' allows the development of a low-cost, low-power and miniature FM-GPS receiver that can trace the path that a container has taken for less than 25$ per container. This paper presents the first results of highway trials (train and sea trials are to be conducted in 2010-2011) of such a low cost, covert, 'Broadcast Assisted GPS'based technology, called 'FM-RFID Tagâ„¢' that records the worldwide displacement of containers and displays the path undertaken by the container while in transit.

"north american vegetation dynamics observed with multi-resolution satellite data","2008","We investigated normalized difference vegetation index data from the NOAA series of Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometers and found regions in North America that experienced marked increases in annual photosynthetic capacity at various times from 1982 to 2005. Inspection of these anomalous areas with multi-resolution data from Landsat, Ikonos, aerial photography, and ancillary data revealed a range of causes for the NDVI increases: climatic influences; severe drought and subsequent recovery; irrigated agriculture expansion; insect outbreaks followed by logging and subsequent regeneration; and forest fires with subsequent regeneration. Vegetation in areas in the high Northern Latitudes appear to be solely impacted by climatic influences. In other areas examined, the impact of anthropogenic effects is more direct. The pattern of NDVI anomalies over longer time periods appear to be driven by long-term climate change but most appear to be associated with climate variability on decadal and shorter time scales along with direct anthropogenic land cover conversions. The local variability of drivers of change demonstrates the difficulty in interpreting changes in NDVI and indicates the complex nature of changes in the carbon cycle within North America. Coarse scale analysis of changes could well fail to identify the important local scale drivers controlling the carbon cycle and to identify the relative roles of disturbance and climate change. Our results document regional land cover land use change and climatic influences that have altered continental scale vegetation dynamics in North America.","Landsat,NDVI,Climate,Land cover,Vegetation dynamics,AVHRR,"
"spatial patterns of landside trade impedance in containerized south american exports","2017","The paper addresses claims implicating higher domestic transportation costs as a significant barrier to Latin America's trade and economic integration - and the region's inadequate transportation infrastructure as the primary cause. The relative “trade space” for U.S.-bound containerized shipments is delineated via reverse spatial interaction modeling. Reconfiguration and reverse calibration of the doubly constrained spatial interaction model is used to derive functional distances between origins and ports of export, as a means of estimating a Trade Impedance Quotient (TIQ) for trade flows at the scale of the continent. Global and local statistics of spatial autocorrelation are then used to analyze the spatial pattern of trade impedance. With this approach, the analysis of containerized flows establishes the existence, extent, location, and spatial distribution of discrepancies in South American landside trade impedance. A large share of trade flows have trade impedance that is disproportionate to distance. Trade impedance at origins is spatially clustered for the total dataset and randomly distributed for commodity segments, and randomly distributed at destinations.

In such a context, oceanographic high-frequency surface-wave (HFSW) radars could be cost-effective sensors for long-range early-warning ship detection and tracking. In this paper, multi-target tracking and data fusion techniques are applied to real data recorded by three low-power HFSW radars installed in the German Bight of the North Sea. Ship reports from the automatic identification system (AIS) are exploited as ground truth information for assessing system performances. Both in situ and model data are used to investigate the capabilities of the systems according to the variations of the meteorological and oceanographic conditions. Preliminary results are presented and discussed, together with an outline for future research studies.","oceanographic conditions,ship tracking,sensor fusion,early-warning ship tracking,data fusion techniques,German Bight,ship detection,Marine vehicles,data fusion,multi-target tracking,multitarget tracking,target tracking,oceanographic HF surface-wave radars,High-frequency surface-wave radar,ships,automatic identification system,oceanographic high-frequency surface-wave radars,early-warning ship detection,meteorological and oceanographic information,Sea surface,search radar,Radar tracking,Sea state,HFSW radars,radar tracking,maritime surveillance systems,meteorological conditions,Ocean temperature,Sensors,"
"an identity-based data integrity auditing scheme for cloud-based maritime transportation systems","2023","With the development of Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled Maritime Transportation Systems (MTS), massive data generated in the system not only requires to be stored reliably and cheaply, but also needs to be analyzed timely. The Cloud-based Maritime Transportation Systems (CMTS) allow users to upload the data without worrying about the price, capacity, location and so on. However, CMTS also brings some security issues, where the integrity protection of outsourced data is one of the most important issues since it is crucial for the safety, reliability and efficiency of sea lanes. To solve this problem, we propose an identity-based dynamic data integrity auditing scheme for CMTS. Our scheme decreases the burden of key management and improves the auditing efficiency by batch auditing. Besides, our scheme also supports dynamic operations on the outsourced data for CMTS. The security analysis shows that our scheme can ensure the feature of storage correctness and resist common attacks. In addition, the performance comparison results with other related schemes show that our scheme not only has the lowest computational cost on all entities, but also greatly reduces the communication overhead of the auditing phase. Therefore, our scheme is very suitable for data integrity verification in CMTS.","dynamic operations,Transportation,data integrity,Public key,outsourced data,Internet of Things,transportation,identity-based integrity auditing,reliability,CMTS,related schemes,Cloud-based Maritime Transportation Systems,Servers,batch auditing,Maritime transportation systems,cloud computing,storage management,massive data,outsourcing,data integrity verification,Data integrity,auditing,cloud storage,identity-based data integrity auditing scheme,Cloud computing,Computational modeling,Things-enabled Maritime Transportation Systems,Security,data integration,auditing efficiency,integrity protection,identity-based dynamic data integrity auditing scheme,"
"the application of remote sensing to canadian petroleum exploration: promising and yet unexploited","1986","This paper reviews some of the successful applications of digital remote sensing to petroleum exploration in different parts of the world. They include the updating of existing geologic maps, the location of anomalies related to hydrocarbon seepage, and the integration of the digital imagery into geologic databases to assess hydrocarbon potential on a given scale. Although most of these techniques are useful potentially in the Canadian environment, there seems to be some reticence in this country towards the use of remotely sensed data. Based on discussions with a number of industry and research personnel, an analysis is made of the reasons why Canadian geoscientists have not yet taken advantage of this readily available tool. Some explanations include: (1) the poor resolution of sensors such as the LANDSAT MSS, (2) the till and vegetation overlying parts of the country, and (3) the fact that some areas of the country are so well mapped that it is felt that a system such as LANDSAT could add no relevant information. Conversely, several considerations would seem to favor widespread usage of remotely sensed data in Canada now that the spectral and spatial resolutions of operational sensors are constantly improving. It is possible to map geologic features such as faults from remotely sensed imagery even if they are buried beneath deep till. The vegetation which covers so much of the land surface can provide both structural and geochemical information. There remain large expanses of the country that are relatively unexplored. Finally, considerable expertise exists in Canada in geoscience data integration and image processing, much of it related to mineral-resource work; this expertise may be directed towards petroleum-resource evaluation. Some procedures are recommended for Canadian petroleum geologists in order that they may derive maximum benefits from remotely sensed data.","Petroleum exploration,Image analysis,SPOT-1,Remote sensing,LANDSAT,Canadian petroleum industry,Data integration,"
"collision risk inference system for maritime autonomous surface ships using colregs rules compliant collision avoidance","2021","Maritime autonomous surface ships (MASS) need to be sufficiently safe to gain commercial acceptance. Collision avoidance strategies in such MASS should comply with the International Regulations for Preventing Collision at the Sea (COLREGs). According to the COLREGs, collision risk assessment, which determines the optimal positioning and timing via all available means appropriate to the prevailing circumstances and conditions, is crucial for preventing collisions. However, existing collision risk assessment methods do not consider all vital factors for the COLREGs rules compliant collision avoidance. We propose a collision risk inference system for MASS that complies with COLREGs vital rules for collision avoidance as follows: 1) actions to avoid collision are defined according to the degree of danger, and a suitable response distance is determined; 2) a collision risk index according to the enlarged ship domain based on the designated response distance by each level is set; 3) all vital factors of the COLREGs rules compliant collision avoidance are extracted as the data when the ship domain enlarged by each level is overlapped; 4) the collision risk inference system is developed by learning extracted data via the adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system. In contrast to existing research, the proposed system considers all vital variables in the COLREGs rules compliant collision avoidance guidelines, thereby improving the timings and positionings of the potential collision warning. Consequently, it could secure more time for decision making to take necessary collision prevention action.","marine accidents,existing collision risk assessment methods,Risk management,Preventing Collision,maritime autonomous surface ships,Marine vehicles,fuzzy reasoning,aerospace safety,collision risk index,necessary collision prevention action,Collision avoidance strategies,ships,marine safety,Accidents,Collision avoidance,Shape,risk management,Sea surface,decision making,ship domain,COLREGs vital rules,Adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system,risk analysis,potential collision warning,near-collision accident,COLREGs rules compliant collision avoidance guidelines,COLREGs,collision risk inference system,Navigation,collision avoidance,"
"dbscan algorithm for ais data reconstruction","2021","Automatic Identification System (AIS) is a telecommunication system created to allow ships to communicate with each other by exchanging messages containing information such as vessel’s ID, position, speed, heading, etc. AIS is useful in many cases, such as early ship collision detection. However, its terrestrial segment’s drawback is a relatively low range (about 74 km, roughly 40 nautical miles). Satellite Automatic Identification System (SAT-AIS) was introduced to overcome this limitation, but it suffers from its own problem known as packet collision. The satellite receives messages from multiple terrestrial cells and communication is synchronized within such cells, but not between them, thus messages got lost or damaged when they appear at the satellite at the same time. In this paper, we present a machine learning-based approach to reconstruct those missing messages and deeply investigate whether or not a density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) can be considered in the first stage of the reconstruction. The experiment focuses on findig the optimal parameters for the clustering, running it both on original and damaged data to finally ascertain that DSBCAN can distinguish individual trajectories in a dataset that can be further reconstructed.","clustering,DBSCAN,AIS data analysis,trajectory reconstruction,AIS,"
"an unambiguous imaging method of moving target for maritime scenes with spaceborne high-resolution and wide-swath sar","2022","In azimuth multichannel high-resolution and wide-swath (AMC-HRWS) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) system, undersampling of azimuth signal results in the failure of the single-channel echo imaging, so the echoes of all the channels should be reconstructed to obtain the unambiguous SAR image. Many methods have been proposed to reconstruct the stationary scene echoes. However, moving targets (MTs) will cause false targets in the reconstructed SAR image, which has a great influence on SAR image interpretation and moving target detection, especially in maritime scenes. Hence, we propose an unambiguous imaging method of the moving target for maritime scenes with AMC-HRWS SAR. First, azimuth deramp processing is introduced to obtain coarse-focused moving targets, and then their echoes can be extracted from the sea clutter. Based on the extracted data, a radial velocity estimation method is proposed, which is high efficiency and does not require redundant channels. In addition, based on the estimated radial velocity and the characteristics of the coarse-focused signal, a novel signal reconstruction method of moving target is presented. The reconstruction performance of this method is not affected by channel imbalance, and false targets can be removed even if there is radial velocity error. Besides, the effectiveness of this scheme is verified by the simulation data and GaoFen-3 SAR real data. The estimated radial velocities of ships are verified by automatic identification system (AIS) information. The imaging results show that false targets are effectively suppressed, and moving targets are located in correct positions.","moving target detection,GaoFen-3 SAR real data,stationary scene echoes,SAR image interpretation,Image reconstruction,image resolution,azimuth multichannel high-resolution,image sampling,wide-swath SAR,single-channel echo imaging,Synthetic aperture radar,Signal reconstruction,high-resolution and wide-swath (HRWS),AMC-HRWS SAR,false targets,object detection,synthetic aperture radar,radial velocity estimation method,signal reconstruction,unambiguous imaging method,image reconstruction,radar imaging,Doppler effect,moving target (MT) signal reconstruction,novel signal reconstruction method,radial velocity estimation,maritime scenes,Azimuth,spaceborne high-resolution,unambiguous SAR image,Imaging,maritime scene,Estimation,synthetic aperture radar (SAR),reconstructed SAR image,Azimuth multichannel (AMC),"
"oxygen isotope composition of diatoms as late holocene climate proxy at two-yurts lake, central kamchatka, russia","2015","Especially in combination with other proxies, the oxygen isotope composition of diatom silica (δ18Odiatom) from lake sediments is useful for interpreting past climate conditions. This paper presents the first oxygen isotope data of fossil diatoms from Kamchatka, Russia, derived from sediment cores from Two-Yurts Lake (TYL). For reconstructing Late Holocene climate change, palaeolimnological investigations also included diatom, pollen and chironomid analysis. The most recent diatom sample (δ18Odiatom=+23.3‰) corresponds well with the present day isotopic composition of the TYL water (mean δ18O=−14.8‰) displaying a reasonable isotope fractionation in the system silica-water. Nonetheless, the TYL δ18Odiatom record is mainly controlled by changes in the isotopic composition of the lake water. TYL is considered as a dynamic system triggered by differential environmental changes closely linked with lake-internal hydrological factors. The diatom silica isotope record displays large variations in δ18Odiatom from +27.3‰ to +23.3‰ from about ~4.5kyr BP until today. A continuous depletion in δ18Odiatom of 4.0‰ is observed in the past 4.5kyr, which is in good accordance with other hemispheric environmental changes (i.e. a summer insolation-driven Mid- to Late Holocene cooling). The overall cooling trend is superimposed by regional hydrological and atmospheric–oceanic changes. These are related to the interplay between Siberian High and Aleutian Low as well as to the ice dynamics in the Sea of Okhotsk. Additionally, combined δ18Odiatom and chironomid interpretations provide new information on changes related to meltwater input to lakes. Hence, this diatom isotope study provides further insight into hydrology and climate dynamics of this remote, rarely investigated area.","Palaeoclimate,Aleutian Low,Palaeolimnology,Diatom oxygen isotopes,Holocene,Biogenic silica,"

"changes in the supply of eastern mediterranean glasses to visigothic spain","2019","This study presents the first comprehensive analysis of glass compositions from Visigothic Spain using high resolution laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS). Major, minor and trace element patterns of 169 well-dated samples from three rural Iberian sites (Congosto, Gózquez and El Pelícano) have brought to light major chronological developments in the production, circulation and use of glass between the fifth and the eighth century CE. The data identify four distinct compositional groups of Egyptian and Levantine origin. Egyptian Foy 2.1, Foy 2.1 high Fe and so-called Magby alongside Apollonia-type Levantine I were the main glass types of the Visigothic period. Due to the tight dating of the majority of the samples, we were able to reveal fundamental changes in the geographical scope of glass supplies to the Iberian Peninsula, and to refine the chronological range of the known primary production groups. The glass group commonly known as série 2.1 or Foy 2.1 started being produced already during the second half of the fifth century. The appearance of Foy 2.1 high Fe can likewise be moved forward to the first half of the sixth century. A plant-ash group referred to as Magby was introduced around the middle of the sixth century. Egypt was undeniably the main supplier of raw glasses to the Iberian Peninsula up to the mid-sixth century CE, after which the Levantine I group became the prime glass type among the analysed assemblages. In the final stages of the Visigothic Kingdom and the early years of Islamic dominion, there is a noticeable drop in the absolute quantity of glass available, together with an increase in recycling. The implications of these transformations in the supply of glass for the organisation of Mediterranean trade are discussed.","Levantine I,Foy 2.1,Recycling,Foy 2.1 high Fe,Magby,Foy 2.2,LA-ICP-MS,"
"a spatiotemporal clustering approach to maritime domain awareness","2013","Spatiotemporal clustering is the process of grouping objects based on both their spatial and temporal similarity. This approach is useful when considering the distance between objects and how that distance changes through time. Spatiotemporal clustering analysis is applied to the maritime domain in this paper, specifically to a defined area of water, during a period of time, in order to gain behavioral knowledge of vessel interactions and provide the opportunity to screen such interactions for further investigation. The proposed spatiotemporal clustering algorithm spatially clusters vessels in the water space using k-means clustering analysis, kinematically refines the clusters based on the similarity of vessel headings, speeds and the distance between them, and temporally analyzes the continuity of membership of the kinematic clusters through time to determine which clusters are moving. The algorithm is implemented in the MATLAB programming environment, verified with a synthetic data scenario, and validated with two real-world datasets.","Kinematics,spatiotemporal clustering algorithm,Clustering algorithms,Spatiotemporal phenomena,Spatiotemporal clustering,maritime domain awareness,Global Positioning System,MATLAB programming,Filtering,marine safety,maritime domain,vessel headings,vessel interaction,water space,marine communication,Visualization,Algorithm design and analysis,k-means clustering analysis,vessel speeds,Arrays,"
"optimal offloading of computing-intensive tasks for edge-aided maritime uav systems","2022","This paper considers the autonomous detecting and tracking task of the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in the maritime environment. In the maritime UAV tracking system, due to the large size of the image computing-task and the shortage of UAV batteries and computational capability, the UAV needs to offload the computing-intensive task to the edge computing server (ECS) to reduce energy consumption and task latency. However, the task latency is still too long for the UAV tracking algorithm due to the large image size. We research the impact of image resolution on the computing task size and detection accuracy, and formulate an edge-aided UAV system with dynamic image resolution. With the constraint on task latency, we jointly optimize the image resolution, offloading rate, transmission power and local central processing unit (CPU) frequency to minimize energy consumption. Although the proposed problem is non-convex, we transform it into a convex optimization problem through decoupling and problem decomposition, and obtain an optimal offloading strategy. The numerical results show the energy efficiency of the proposed strategy by comparing it with the local first offloading strategy and the edge first offloading strategy.","Image edge detection,autonomous detecting,image resolution,Energy consumption,Vehicular and wireless technologies,edge computing server,image size,unmanned aerial vehicle,Target tracking,optimisation,edge computing,tracking task,convex optimization problem,UAV batteries,offload,visual target tracking,Autonomous aerial vehicles,power aware computing,computational capability,optimal offloading strategy,edge-aided maritime UAV systems,computing task size,autonomous aerial vehicles,marine engineering computing,dynamic image resolution,maritime environment,energy consumption,Image resolution,energy conservation,computing-intensive task,Transforms,UAV tracking algorithm,UAV,edge-aided UAV system,image computing-task,"
"sediment geochemistry in coastal maritime antarctica (admiralty bay, king george island): evidence from rare earths and other elements","2007","We report the concentrations of 22 elements in short coastal sediment cores of Admiralty Bay (King George Island, Antarctica) determined by Neutron Activation Analysis. We focus the discussion on rare earth elements (REE) because their fractionation patterns in sediments relative to local sources may offer insights about weathering, transportation, deposition, and diagenetic processes. We found strong correlations between REE and Th, indicating detrital origin. Despite strong Eh gradients, the Th-normalized redox-sensitive elements (e.g., Eu, Ce, Fe, As, and others) showed little variability within the sedimentary environment. The exceptions were U (depleted in the upper few centimeters) and Br (enriched in the upper few centimeters). While U appears to be removed from seawater via uptake across the boundary of reducing sediments, the mechanisms driving Br accumulation are unclear, but perhaps related to increasing diatom production driven by regional warming. A comparison with published concentrations from rocks representing the regional eroding units showed that the characteristics of source rock could be recognized in the REE fractionation patterns in our sediments. These results imply no significant alteration during weathering and sediment transport in the coastal region of Admiralty Bay and the prevalence of strong periglacial erosion in ice-free areas of maritime Antarctica in spite of the relatively mild regional environmental setting (e.g., high moisture and high temperatures).","Heavy metal,Diagenesis,REE,NAA,Bromine,Sediment,Antarctica,Weathering,Coastal environment,"
"observing and understanding the southeast asian aerosol system by remote sensing: an initial review and analysis for the seven southeast asian studies (7seas) program","2013","Southeast Asia (SEA) hosts one of the most complex aerosol systems in the world, with convoluted meteorological scales, sharp geographic and socioeconomic features, high biological productivity, mixtures of a wide range of atmospheric pollutants, and likely a significant susceptibility to global climate change. This physical complexity of SEA is coupled with one of the world's most challenging environments for both in situ and remote sensing observation. The 7-Southeast Asian Studies (7SEAS) program was formed to facilitate interdisciplinary research into the integrated SEA aerosol environment via grass roots style collaboration. In support of the early 7SEAS program and the affiliated Southeast Asia Composition, Cloud, Climate Coupling Regional Study (SEAC4RS), this review was created to outline the network of connections linking aerosol particles in SEA with meteorology, climate and the total earth system. In this review, we focus on and repeatedly link back to our primary data source: satellite aerosol remote sensing and associated observability issues. We begin with a brief rationale for the program, outlining key aerosol impacts and, comparing their magnitudes to the relative uncertainty of observations. We then discuss aspects of SEA's physical, socio-economic and biological geography relevant to meteorology and observability issues associated with clouds and precipitation. We show that not only does SEA pose significant observability challenges for aerosol particles, but for clouds and precipitation as well. With the fundamentals of the environment outlined, we explore SEA's most studied aerosol issue: biomass burning. We summarize research on bulk aerosol properties for SEA, including a short synopsis of recent AERONET observations. We describe long range transport patterns. Finally, considerable attention is paid to satellite aerosol observability issues, with a face value comparison of common aerosol products in the region including passive and active aerosol products as well as fluxes. We show that satellite data products diverge greatly due to a host of known artifacts. These artifacts have important implications for how research is conducted, and care must be taken when using satellite products to study aerosol problems. The paper ends with a discussion of how the community can approach this complex and important environment.","Southeast Asia,Air Pollution,Biomass Burning,Aerosol,Meteorology,Remote Sensing,Maritime Continent,"
"identifying key features in aggregated real-life ais-messages for classification of maritime vessels by random forests","2023","Classification of vessels is a major task in many duties of maritime surveillance. In previous work, ad hoc approaches for classifying maritime vessels were applied to large sets of single AIS messages. The resulting performance has been explored based on real-life datasets in different maritime areas. The approaches were used in a particular application scenario of detecting AIS spoofing in fishery scenarios. Seeing good classification results, in particular by Random Forests, the questions arise whether these at least partly resulted from overfitting phenomena and which of the feature of classification in this problem are most relevant. To address these questions in the current contribution, AIS messages are aggregated per vessel and by the hour by statistical means providing a new AIS feature representation as a basis for classification. By providing a new data representation to the Random Forest classifier, we evaluate classification performance. Then we restrict the presented data to the semantic feature subgroups of the vesselâ€™s positional, course, speed, and dimensions data individually and identify the key features of the classification. The results show that in our exemplary maritime experiments, classification relies mostly on vesselsâ€™ positional and dimensional information.","Semantics,experimental comparison,aggregated messages,Random forests,Surveillance,Classification,Artificial intelligence,key features,Sensitivity,Task analysis,Behavioral sciences,performance evaluation,maritime surveillance systems,AIS,"

"imposex and organotin prevalence in a european post-legislative scenario: temporal trends from 2003 to 2008","2009","Imposex levels and organotin tissue concentrations were assessed in Nassarius reticulatus females collected between June and August 2008 at 23 sites along the Portuguese coast. Females with imposex were present at all sampling sites with highest levels inside main harbors. Imposex parameters across sampling stations varied between 6.3% and 100% for %I, 0.2–4.4 for VDSI, 0.1–7.8mm for FPL, 0.3–88.9% for RPLI and 0.0–1.1 for AOS. TBT levels varied between 3.5 and 380ngSng−1 dw, representing an average proportion of 50.4% of total butyltins (∑BTs=MBT+DBT+TBT). Sterile females were detected at two locations. Highly significant correlations between imposex and TBT levels were found. The efficacy of the EU legislation banning the use of TBT-based antifouling paints since 2003 (EC Regulation 782/2003) was evaluated by comparing the levels of imposex observed in 2008 with those reported for 2003. OTs tissue concentrations were also determined in preserved samples collected in 2003. There was a decrease in imposex and TBT tissue contamination between 2003 and 2008 indicating that a decline in TBT pollution has occurred in the Portuguese coast since the implementation of the legislation. Considering that the EC Regulation 782/2003 is an anticipation of the IMO AFS Convention, a global scale decrease in TBT pollution can be expected in the near future. Despite the rapid amelioration in the Portuguese coast, TBT pollution is still a problem as the Ecological Quality Objective (EcoQO) proposed by OSPAR Commission was not achieved in 91% of the surveyed sites.","Portuguese coast,EC Regulation 782/2003,Sterility,Tributyltin,"
"container port performance measurement and comparison leveraging ship gps traces and maritime open data","2016","Container ports are generally measured and compared using performance indicators such as container throughput and facility productivity. Being able to measure the performance of container ports quantitatively is of great importance for researchers to design models for port operation and container logistics. Instead of relying on the manually collected statistical information from different port authorities and shipping companies, we propose to leverage the pervasive ship GPS traces and maritime open data to derive port performance indicators, including ship traffic, container throughput, berth utilization, and terminal productivity. These performance indicators are found to be directly related to the number of container ships arriving at the terminals and the number of containers handled at each ship. Therefore, we propose a framework that takes the ships' container-handling events at terminals as the basis for port performance measurement. With the inferred port performance indicators, we further compare the strengths and weaknesses of different container ports at the terminal level, port level, and region level, which can potentially benefit terminal productivity improvement, liner schedule optimization, and regional economic development planning. In order to evaluate the proposed framework, we conduct extensive studies on large-scale real-world GPS traces of container ships collected from major container ports worldwide through the year, as well as various maritime open data sources concerning ships and ports. Evaluation results confirm that the proposed framework not only can accurately estimate various port performance indicators but also effectively produces port comparison results such as port performance ranking and port region comparison.","open data,Productivity,container throughput,Ports (Computers),Throughput,regional economic development planning,performance indicators,liner schedule optimization,GPS traces,Marine vehicles,urban computing,Global Positioning System,port authorities,scheduling,port operation,terminal productivity improvement,statistical analysis,ships,Containers,shipping companies,container port performance measurement,marine engineering,berth utilization,container logistics,optimisation,Measurement,sea ports,comparison leveraging ship,maritime open data sources,logistics data processing,ship traffic,Container port,intelligent transportation system (ITS),statistical information,GPS trace,productivity,"

"synergistic abiotic and biotic stressors explain widespread decline of pinus pinaster in a mixed forest","2019","Global change potentially increases forest vulnerability. Different abiotic and biotic factors may interact to cause forest decline and accelerated tree mortality. We studied a mixed Mediterranean continental forest where Pinus pinaster Ait. (maritime pine) shows widespread decline to analyse the role of different abiotic and biotic factors on health status and growth dynamics both at the individual and plot levels. We also analysed stand composition and regeneration of tree species to check whether there is a change in species dominance. Fungal pathogens were seldom present and we detected no pervasive fungi or insect infestation and no presence of pathogens like Heterobasidion or Phytophthora. Infection of hemiparasite plants like Viscum album L. (mistletoe) can reduce leaf area and its abundance is generally considered an expression of host decline. Yet, the existence among declining trees of high defoliation levels without mistletoe, but not vice versa, suggests that defoliation in response to some abiotic stressor could be a predisposing factor preceding mistletoe infection. Compared to healthy trees, declining and dead trees exhibited higher defoliation rates, smaller needles and lower recent growth with steeper negative trends. Dead and declining trees showed similar negative growth trends since the early 1990s droughts, which we interpreted as early warning signals anticipating mortality of currently declining trees in the near future. Mortality of maritime pine extending across all size classes, the lower presence of this species in the smallest size classes and its lack of regeneration suggest it is potentially losing its current dominance and being replaced by other co-occurring, more drought-tolerant species. Our results unravelled that maritime pine decline seems to be mainly driven by a combination of predisposing and inciting abiotic factors (microenvironment and drought stress) and biotic factors (mistletoe). The absence of widespread fungal pathogens suggests that they may have a minor role on pine decline acting only eventually as contributing factors. Although there could be other interrelations among factors or other biotic agents at play, our results strongly suggest that water stress plays a major role in the decline process of the dominant species on an ecosystem with strong land-use legacies.","Abiotic stress,Mistletoe,Defoliation,Drought,Land-use,Fungal pathogens,"

"resource allocation for ofdm-based maritime edge computing networks","2020","Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs) can support various maritime applications, such as ocean environment monitoring and target tracking applications. Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) is a promising technology to improve the computing capacities and energy efficiencies of the USVs with latency sensitive computation tasks. In this paper, an OFDM-based maritime broadband MEC system model is developed, where a command surface vehicle provides edge computing service to the surrounding USVs, and the task offloading and resource allocation are formulated as an optimization problem with a goal of minimizing the USVs energy consumption, constrained by the task execution delay requirement and allowable transmit power.

"joint tracking and classification for extended targets in maritime surveillance","2018","In the framework of target tracking, joint tracking and classification (JTC) based approaches have been recently introduced to adjust the trajectory estimation to a given type of target. In a maritime surveillance framework, these approaches leverage marine radar capabilities to provide high resolution measurements. It can then be helpful to choose relevant motion models regarding the tracking algorithm. Among them, the authors recently proposed to take advantage of the target extent measurements for single or multiple-target tracking. This work was based on a point source hypothesis regarding the position measurement of each target. However, this is no longer suitable for extended target tracking. An extension of our previous work to track properly extended targets whose position measurement can be obtained from any point source of its surface is thus proposed. For this purpose, random matrix theory is leveraged. Eventually, the relevance of the proposed approach with simulated data is analyzed.","high resolution measurements,position measurement,Position measurement,marine radar,Bayesian estimation,image resolution,image motion analysis,matrix algebra,trajectory estimation,maritime surveillance framework,Radar measurements,random matrix theory,multiple-target tracking,target tracking,tracking algorithm,joint tracking and classification,Target tracking,extended target tracking,image classification,search radar,Radar tracking,radar imaging,random matrix,radar tracking,target extent measurements,Surveillance,motion models,Joint tracking and classification,target classification,marine radar capabilities,target extent,"
"controls on rainfall variability in the tropical south pacific for the last 350 years reconstructed from oxygen isotopes in stalagmites from the cook islands","2022","The hydroclimate of the South Pacific is highly variable on a range of timescales, however, the brevity of instrumental data in the region complicates the detection and attribution of this variability. Annually laminated speleothems may fill this knowledge gap by providing paleo-hydroclimate proxy data extending beyond the instrumental period. In this study, replicated oxygen isotope (δ18O) time series from two stalagmites from Pouatea (Pu17) and Nurau (Nu16) caves in the southern Cook Islands were used to reconstruct the variability of effective infiltration over the past 350 years (1672–2019 CE) based on observational rainfall data and cave monitoring and calcite farming experiments. The reconstructed infiltration was then compared to available reconstructions of known climate drivers of the South Pacific. Significant dry and wet periods over the last 350 years were identified based on the δ18O signal of compact/porous calcite fabric and their δ13C signals. The hydroclimate significance of these proxies was validated through comparison with the instrumental records. We could not reach an annual resolution of reconstructed infiltration, due to a combination of stable isotope sampling limitations and mixing effects within the aquifer. Nevertheless, the combined δ18O record of Pu17 and Nu16 identifies that the main driver of infiltration and, hence rainfall variability, in the southern Cook Islands is the location of the South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ), which in turn is modulated by the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO). This study demonstrates the hydroclimate significance of speleothem fabrics when combined with O and C stable isotopes, and adds paleoclimate information to a region that has a paucity of data.","ENSO,Stalagmites,Rainfall,SPCZ,Paleoclimate,δO,"
"submarine groundwater discharge detection through remote sensing: an application of landsat 7 and 8 in hawaiʻi and ireland","2022","Submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) represents an important component of the global water cycle. Improved assessment of SGD occurrences provides information to constrain current estimates of total freshwater discharges, which are crucial for evaluation of changes in the global water cycle. This study leverages SGD linkages to patterns in sea surface temperature (SST) and color. Typically, groundwater temperatures exhibit less variability than SST and tend to have temperature distinct from sea water. Consequently, thermally anomalous plumes often occur in coastal areas with SGD. Nutrient-enriched groundwater flows have been linked to changes in ocean color as a consequence of algae growth and of the presence of colored dissolved organic matter. Under such conditions, SGD presence may also manifest as plumes of different colors. Changes in SST and color can be captured through satellite imagery for the thermal infrared and visible bands, which are used here to detect potential SGD (PSGD) occurrences. A method based on clustering and spectroscopy techniques is applied to automatically detect PSGD plumes. SST data are clustered to map SST anomalies. Derivative analysis and angular distance are applied to identify a color signature linked to SGD. In a novel approach, SST and color are combined to identify PSGD through remote sensing. The methods presented in this study were applied to Landsat 7 and 8 imagery captured over southern Ireland and the west coast of the Island of Hawaiʻi, where past field surveys of radon isotopes activities and salinity have documented SGD occurrences. These selected sites are used as validation points. Derivative analysis and angular distance resulted in PSGD plumes in the vicinity of sampled locations, mainly locations with samples that are strong indicators of SGD. In general, the PSGD plumes derived from each method are compared as independent, parallel lines of evidence of PSGD occurrences. Results also show that PSGD pixels from derivative analysis and angular distance alone, without considering SST, can be obfuscated by confounding factors, such as low tides and unrelated chlorophyll enrichment, and that combining SST and color data reduces those effects. These results provide further evidence for PSGD occurrences along the south coast of Ireland and the west coast of the Island of Hawaiʻi, and showcase that satellite data can be used to better identify the location of PSGD occurrences over large areas.","Coastal waters,Submarine groundwater discharge,Ocean color,Sea surface temperature,"
"similarity grouping-guided neural network modeling for maritime time series prediction","2019","Reliable and accurate prediction of time series plays a crucial role in the maritime industry, such as economic investment, transportation planning, port planning, design, and so on. The dynamic growth of maritime time series has the predominantly complex, and nonlinear and non-stationary properties. To guarantee high-quality prediction performance, we propose to first adopt the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and ensemble EMD (EEMD) methods to decompose the original time series into high- and low-frequency components. The low-frequency components can be easily predicted directly through traditional neural network (NN) methods. It is more difficult to predict high-frequency components due to their properties of weak mathematical regularity. To take advantage of the inherent self-similarities within high-frequency components, these components will be divided into several continuous small (overlapping) segments. The grouped segments with high similarities are then selected to form more proper training datasets for traditional NN methods. This regrouping strategy can assist in enhancing the prediction accuracy of high-frequency components. The final prediction result is obtained by integrating the predicted high- and low-frequency components. Our proposed three-step prediction frameworks benefit from the time series decomposition and similar segments grouping. The experiments on both port cargo throughput and vessel traffic flow have illustrated its superior performance in terms of prediction accuracy and robustness.","predicted high- frequency components,Transportation,Data prediction,time series decomposition,high-frequency components,nonstationary properties,Planning,reliable prediction,Predictive models,original time series,dynamic time warping (DTW),neural nets,low-frequency components,high-quality prediction performance,marine engineering,Artificial neural networks,similar segments grouping,Time series analysis,similarity grouping,similarity grouping-guided neural network modeling,three-step prediction frameworks,empirical mode decomposition (EMD),time series,Training,prediction accuracy,NN methods,maritime industry,maritime time series prediction,neural network,neural network methods,EMD methods,"
"wave height prediction suitable for maritime transportation based on green ocean of things","2023","Nowadays, the application fields of the Internet of Things (IoT) involve all aspects. This article combines ocean research with the IoT, in order to investigate the wave height prediction to assist ships to improve the economy and safety of maritime transportation and proposes an ocean IoT Green Ocean of Things (GOoT) with a green and low-carbon concept. In the wave height prediction, we apply a hybrid model (EMD-TCN) combining the temporal convolutional network (TCN) and the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) to the buoy observation data. We then compare it with TCN, long short-term memory (LSTM), and hybrid model EMD-LSTM. By testing the data of eight selected NDBC buoys distributed in different sea areas, the effectiveness of the EMD-TCN hybrid model in wave height prediction is verified. The hysteresis problem in previous wave height prediction research is eliminated, while improving the accuracy of the wave height prediction. In the 24 h, 36 h, and 48 h wave height prediction, the minimum mean absolute errors are 0.1265, 0.1689, and 0.1963, respectively; the maximum coefficient of determination are 0.9388, 0.9019, and 0.8712, respectively.

"reliability of multi-purpose offshore-facilities: present status and future direction in australia","2021","Sustainable use of the ocean for food and energy production is an emerging area of research in different countries around the world. This goal is pursued by the Australian aquaculture, offshore engineering and renewable energy industries, research organisations and the government through the “Blue Economy Cooperative Research Centre”. To address the challenges of offshore food and energy production, leveraging the benefits of co-location, vertical integration, infrastructure and shared services, will be enabled through the development of novel Multi-Purpose Offshore-Platforms (MPOP). The structural integrity of the designed systems when being deployed in the harsh offshore environment is one of the main challenges in developing the MPOPs. Employing structural reliability analysis methods for assessing the structural safety of the novel aquaculture-MPOPs comes with different limitations. This review aims at shedding light on these limitations and discusses the current status and future directions for structural reliability analysis of a novel aquaculture-MPOP considering Australia’s unique environment. To achieve this aim, challenges which exist at different stages of reliability assessment, from data collection and uncertainty quantification to load and structural modelling and reliability analysis implementation, are discussed. Furthermore, several solutions to these challenges are proposed based on the existing knowledge in other sectors, and particularly from the offshore oil and gas industry. Based on the identified gaps in the review process, potential areas for future research are introduced to enable a safer and more reliable operation of the MPOPs.","Offshore platforms,Ocean multi-use,Blue economy,Structural integrity,Reliability analysis,"
"on some cognitive processing for airborne maritime radar","2017","This paper deals with the issue of detection tasks optimization in the case of airborne radar for maritime surveillance mission thanks to cognitive mechanisms, more precisely thanks to the learning of the radar environment (clutter). The proposed algorithm aims at selecting the most appropriate radar mode, if applicable the most appropriate platform altitude and horizontal position by analyzing the sea clutter. The analysis of the environment and then the inference of a more favorable mode of operation are based on the adjustment of the measurements to environment models, in particular clutter models. Another way to improve detection performance is the introduction of external knowledge in processing (Knowledge-Aided processing).

"frequency based satellite monitoring of small scale explosive activity at remote north pacific volcanoes","2014","Monitoring of volcanoes in the North Pacific can be an expensive and sometimes dangerous task, specifically for those located in Alaska (USA) and Kamchatka (Russia). An active frequency detection method previously used at Stromboli, Italy, uses the thermal- and mid-infrared wavelength bands from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite data to detect anomalies at a volcano. This method focuses on small scale explosive activity, often referred to as Strombolian activity which can produce small spatter fields near a volcano's active vent. In the North Pacific, there are a number of volcanoes which exhibit small scale explosive activity and three are the focus of this study: Chuginadak (Mt. Cleveland) and Shishaldin in Alaska, and Karymsky Volcano in Kamchatka. Satellite images from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) were used to monitor the frequency of thermal features as well as the occurrence of ash plumes at each volcano. This data was then used to produce a time series spanning 2005–2010 for all three volcanoes. During this time period, each volcano underwent a series of eruptive cycles including background levels of activity, heightened frequency of small explosions (identified as precursory activity), and heightened activity typified by ash plume-producing eruptions. Each location has a unique precursory signal, both in timing and magnitude. The use of a previously developed method on a new sample set of volcanoes has proved the validity of this method as a monitoring tool for volcanoes with small scale explosive activity. This method should be applied to a larger set of volcanoes to continue the development and database production for its use as a volcano monitoring tool.","Thermal infrared,Explosive activity,Remote sensing,Volcano monitoring,North Pacific,"

"context-based models to overcome operational challenges in maritime security","2015","Piracy and smuggling are major international problems which not only threaten maritime security but also affect the global economy. Even though NATO and international forces have been relentlessly fighting maritime crime in East Africa (Gulf of Aden), the problems still persist and maritime crime has moved to West Africa (Gulf of Guinea). In the same vein, the Joint Interagency Task Force-South (JIATF-S) has had substantial operational success, controlling the vast geographical spread of smugglers in the East Pacific and Caribbean Sea. Due to limited number of maritime assets available, every resource needs to be efficiently allocated, both in time and space. This poses a great operational challenge requiring the integration and fusion of disparate information relevant to the mission and dynamic allocation of resources under uncertainty. Operational planning and execution for counter-smuggling and counter-piracy operations involve surveillance (to search, detect, track and identify potential threats) and interdiction operations (to intercept, investigate and potentially apprehend the suspects) in a dynamic and uncertain mission environment. In this paper, we present context-based models for counter-smuggling and counter-piracy missions, where the smuggling and piracy activities are represented in the form of color coded heat maps built using Intelligence information (INTEL), meteorological and oceanographic (METOC) information and other mission-specific attributes (sensor observations, target types and their behavior, etc.); these maps are interpreted as probability of activity (PoA) surfaces.

"background modeling combined with multiple features in the fourier domain for maritime infrared target detection","2022","To detect ship targets in dynamic sea backgrounds, a robust foreground detection method based on background modeling combined with multiple features in the Fourier domain (BMMFF) is proposed. Because the fluctuation of seawater is similar to a sine wave, the amplitude spectrum of the seawater in the Fourier domain has strong energy concentration, and the background model is built in the Fourier domain. The local statistical characteristics can effectively reflect the properties of a specific position, and the target frequency points are extracted by comparing the local statistical characteristic differences between the amplitude spectrum of the test frame and the updated background. Additionally, two different strategies are used to update the background for cases with or without sudden waves in two adjacent test frames. When the target and seawater have different contrast in different scenes, the threshold is set according to the seawaterâ€™s fluctuation degree, which is classified into three different levels in the training stage. Moreover, the linear correlation feature between the test frame and the updated background and the oscillation feature of the test frameâ€™s amplitude spectrum are proposed in the Fourier domain, which can better segment targets in relatively calm and violent sea scenes, respectively. Thus, the two features are combined with the background model with a reasonable strategy to further improve the detection accuracy. The experimental results demonstrate that BMMFF outperforms related comparison algorithms in different challenging sea scenes. The average false alarm rate of BMMFF is reduced by approximately 30% in the case where its average detection rate is similar to that of other algorithms.","target frequency points,linear correlation feature,Marine vehicles,Feature extraction,seawater,sea scenes,statistical analysis,dynamic sea backgrounds,ships,marine engineering,background modeling,object detection,ship targets,Oscillators,feature extraction,Correlation,Adaptation models,foreground detection method,infrared imaging,Dual-mode sea background model,local statistical characteristic differences,Object detection,image segmentation,Data mining,oscillation feature,Fourier domain,maritime infrared target detection,"
"an intelligent decision algorithm for the generation of maritime search and rescue emergency response plans","2019","Maritime search and rescue (SAR) decisions are the most important part of maritime SAR operations. In the process of making maritime SAR decisions, a key factor affecting efficiency and success rate is how to quickly respond to accidents and develop an emergency response plan. At present, maritime SAR emergency response plans are still mostly obtained through a combination of drift prediction models and SAR experience. There is a lack of SAR resource scheduling and SAR task assignment. The primary purpose of this paper is to explore the possibility of using an intelligent decision-making algorithm to formulate maritime SAR emergency response plans so as to produce results more scientifically. First, the relevant research areas and research data are briefly introduced, and the main mathematical models involved in the optimal search theory are expounded. Next, key technologies involved in the process of maritime SAR emergency response plan generation, including the determination of search area, the scheduling of SAR resources, the allocation of search tasks, and the planning of search routes, are analyzed in detail. Two optimization model algorithms, namely the SAR resource scheduling model based on genetic simulated annealing algorithm (GSAA) and the regional task allocation algorithm based on space-time characteristics, are proposed as approaches to solving the problem of resource scheduling and task allocation. Finally, the effectiveness and optimization of the proposed algorithms are verified by analyzing the emergency response of a real case which occurred in the Bohai Sea and comparing the different schemes.

"debris slopes ventilation in the periglacial zone of the tatra mountains (poland and slovakia): the indicators","2012","This paper examines environmental indicators of debris slopes ventilation in the periglacial zone of the Tatra Mountains. Geomorphological and meteorological influences on ground surface temperature anomaly, hoarfrost, air ventilation funnels and snow melt windows, were analyzed as well as locations of long-lying snow and permafrost patches. The results show that debris slope ventilation is a common phenomenon occurring in different periods of the year. Its range is influenced mainly by substratum porosity (ground and snow cover), and the difference between the pressure inside and outside this medium (pore and atmospheric air temperature/dense; wind velocity). The height of the slope (‘chimney’) is less important. Some phenomena assumed to be evidences of slope ventilation are often connected with other factors influencing the thermal balance of the ground and the size of snow accumulation.","Tatra Mountains,Ground temperature,Debris slopes,Sporadic permafrost,Mountain environment,Air circulation,"

"the regional protocol for local communications among maritime autonomous surface ships based on vdes","2023","In order to provide more collision avoidance information to ships that may encounter each other in dense sea areas, prevent collision events, and minimize channel data pressure, ensure network reliability and reduce latency, this paper proposes a regional protocol for local communications among maritime autonomous surface ships based on VDES (High Frequency Data Exchange System). Based on the theoretical foundation of the ship domain model in the field of ships, the area where collision danger exists is found by guiding the ship domain model, and this area is used as the routing flood area, and the routing request is limited to this area. The improved AODV (Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector) routing forwarding algorithm is used to establish a communication link between ships in the routing request area using real-time location information. This can exchange more information with ships located in the collision risk area to assist in collaborative obstacle avoidance and prevent accidents. At the same time, it effectively avoids network-wide routing flooding, avoids network congestion, and ensures network stability. Simulation analysis shows that this protocol is superior to AIS in terms of delivery rate and delay on the basis of realizing business functions. This will be beneficial for obstacle avoidance between encountering ships.","channel data pressure,maritime autonomous surface ships,Marine vehicles,Delays,marine navigation,AODV routing protocol,regional protocol,communication link,routing protocols,high frequency data exchange system,ship field model,collision danger,collision risk area,Routing protocols,ships,marine safety,Stability criteria,collision avoidance information,network-wide routing flooding,telecommunication congestion control,mobile radio,Sea surface,routing request area,Collaboration,collaborative obstacle avoidance,collision events,dense sea areas,routing flood area,encountering ships,Routing,mobile robots,real-time location information,collision avoidance,ship domain model,VDES,local communications,network reliability,regional routing protocol,"
"a sensitivity quantification approach to significance analysis of thrusters in dynamic positioning operations","2021","The safety of offshore operations is highly dependent on the dynamic positioning (DP) capability of a vessel. Meanwhile, DP capability comes down to the ability of the thrust generated by thrusters to counteract environmental forces. Therefore, it is significant to investigate which thrusters are important to the position-keeping ability of vessels. However, complex environmental factors make the investigation of thrusters' importance more complicated. Hence, this paper proposes a new method to identify the influence of each thruster on vessel's station-keeping capability in different sea states. The station-keeping capability is quantified by a defined synthesized positioning ability criterion comprised by vessel position, heading angle, and consumed power. Through the comparison of different machine learning approaches, support vector machine (SVM) is used for building a surrogate model between DP capability and thrusters. In order to determine the most sensitive thruster in the whole process of vessel operation, an improved sensitivity analysis (SA) called ‘PAWN’ is employed along with statistical analysis to evaluate the significance of thrusters from different perspectives. Seventeen cases are investigated with respect to different thruster failures in various sea states. The results show the proposed method is able to identify the significance of each thruster in different scenarios.","Statistical analysis,Sensitivity analysis,Dynamic positioning capability,Thruster failures,"
"societal need for improved understanding of climate change, anthropogenic impacts, and geo-hazard warning drive development of ocean observatories in european seas","2011","Society’s needs for a network of in situ ocean observing systems cross many areas of earth and marine science. Here we review the science themes that benefit from data supplied from ocean observatories. Understanding from existing studies is fragmented to the extent that it lacks the coherent long-term monitoring needed to address questions at the scales essential to understand climate change and improve geo-hazard early warning. Data sets from the deep sea are particularly rare with long-term data available from only a few locations worldwide. These science areas have impacts on societal health and well-being and our awareness of ocean function in a shifting climate. Substantial efforts are underway to realise a network of open-ocean observatories around European Seas that will operate over multiple decades. Some systems are already collecting high-resolution data from surface, water column, seafloor, and sub-seafloor sensors linked to shore by satellite or cable connection in real or near-real time, along with samples and other data collected in a delayed mode. We expect that such observatories will contribute to answering major ocean science questions including: How can monitoring of factors such as seismic activity, pore fluid chemistry and pressure, and gas hydrate stability improve seismic, slope failure, and tsunami warning? What aspects of physical oceanography, biogeochemical cycling, and ecosystems will be most sensitive to climatic and anthropogenic change? What are natural versus anthropogenic changes? Most fundamentally, how are marine processes that occur at differing scales related? The development of ocean observatories provides a substantial opportunity for ocean science to evolve in Europe. Here we also describe some basic attributes of network design. Observatory networks provide the means to coordinate and integrate the collection of standardised data capable of bridging measurement scales across a dispersed area in European Seas adding needed certainty to estimates of future oceanic conditions. Observatory data can be analysed along with other data such as those from satellites, drifting floats, autonomous underwater vehicles, model analysis, and the known distribution and abundances of marine fauna in order to address some of the questions posed above. Standardised methods for information management are also becoming established to ensure better accessibility and traceability of these data sets and ultimately to increase their use for societal benefit. The connection of ocean observatory effort into larger frameworks including the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) and the Global Monitoring of Environment and Security (GMES) is integral to its success. It is in a greater integrated framework that the full potential of the component systems will be realised.",""
"use of the automatic identification system (ais) on autonomous weather buoys for maritime domain awareness applications","2006","The United States Coast Guard (USCG), as part of the Department of Homeland Security, is responsible for a wide variety of missions in the maritime domain. In order to support the accomplishment of these missions, the USCG needs to collect as much information as possible on activities occurring in the maritime domain. A large part of maritime activity relates to the movement of vessels. Therefore, detection, classification, identification and monitoring of vessels are a key component of what is known as Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA). The Automatic Identification System (AIS) is a technology that is used primarily as a tool for maritime safety, including vessel collision avoidance and as a means for coastal nations' Vessel Traffic Services (VTSs) to get information on vessels operating near their coasts. AIS equipment aboard vessels continuously and autonomously transmits information about the vessel including its identity, position, course, and speed to enhance safety. These transmissions can be received by other vessels or by land-based stations equipped with AIS receivers. The USCG sees the capability AIS provides, particularly for vessel tracking, as a major contributor to MDA and VTS. To extend the capability of USCG land-based AIS monitoring stations further offshore, the USCG Maritime Domain Awareness Program Integration Office sponsored the development of a near real-time, autonomous automatic identification and telemetry system based on AIS technology for installation on National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) weather buoys through the National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) and its technical support contractor, Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC).","Satellites,prototype system,satellite telemetry,Monitoring,geosynchronous satellite transmission system,Transmitters,satellite transmitter,AD 2005 03 to 2005 06,autonomous weather buoys,Assembly systems,oceanographic equipment,Relays,AIS-equipped vessel detection,Automatic Identification System,Cape Cod,Maritime Domain Awareness applications,MDA,Prototypes,Charleston,Strait of Juan de Fuca,offshore installations,Telemetry,real-time relay,Real time systems,USCG,South Carolina,national security,meteorology,AIS receiver,NDBC Data Assembly Center,NDAC,Massachusetts,marine vehicles,collision avoidance,System testing,Embedded system,San Francisco Harbor,"

"a new road safety indicator based on vehicle trajectory analysis","2016","In 2014, in France, accidents on rural roads accounted for roughly 63% of road mortality (ONISR, 2014). Yet, the locations of accidents are increasingly spread, and it is becoming difficult for road managers to set priorities for interventions on their road network. They can no longer base their strategy on accident analysis. Road managers need to quickly measure the effectiveness of a modified facility, improvement of facilities or modification of the environment. On this type of site accident analysis requires a period of 3 to 5 years to determine the effectiveness of a change. This period of time does not meet the requirements of road managers or road users. To provide a high safety level, managers are implementing innovative developments: wall effect chicane at crossroads, dynamic warning signs, rural roundabouts, etc. Managers want to quickly assess these innovations. In addition, they have less and less money, so it is necessary to give them tools to help prioritize their intervention. It is also preferable for road managers to take preventive action rather than having to wait for accidents or serious injuries to occur, in order to carry out diagnosis and propose countermeasures. In this article, we propose a new safety indicator based on trajectory analysis. By trajectory, we mean a time-function that describes vehicle movement including not only its path on the road but also speeds and accelerations in both horizontal directions (longitudinal and transverse). These trajectories describe vehicle/infrastructure/driver interactions and reveal inadequacies that can lead to accidents. These trajectories are obtained using two roadside observation systems that analyse vehicle trajectories on two specific locations: curves and intersections on rural roads. The first tool is a local trajectory measurement system. It records trajectories of all vehicles passing through a specific zone. The goal is to observe abnormal paths that reveal dysfunctions in the vehicle/Infrastructure/driver system. The main applications-related contribution of this work focuses on developing a comprehensive solution for accurately estimating vehicle trajectories based on a combination of video images and range finder (telemeter) measurements. The purpose of the second tool is to improve understanding of dysfunctions at a crossroads and to evaluate the effectiveness of facilities. A precise study of patterns encountered on accident-prone intersections on rural roads showed that some situations are much more dangerous and frequent than others. In particular, most accidents at intersections are caused by vehicles crossing main roads. The second system presented in this paper detects and records conflicts between users on the secondary road who are crossing the main road, and users driving straight ahead on the main road. This kind of conflict represents the main type of accidents called crossing at grade accidents. The proposed risk indicator is equal to the number of conflicts (near-misses), weighted by the severity of the conflicts recorded in a given period. We chose to take the number of conflicts per hour. The purpose of these tools is to understand anomalies in the vehicle/infrastructure/driver system, and to evaluate the effectiveness of countermeasures on safety. Associated with risk indicators they make it possible to objectively assess driver behaviours with respect to the road infrastructure.","safety,trajectories,curves,intersections,evaluation,"
"organic contaminants in bats: trends and new issues","2014","Exposure to contaminants, often pesticides, has been implicated as a major factor contributing to decreases in bat populations. Bats provide essential ecosystem services and a sustained, thriving population is vital for ecosystem health. Understanding issues threatening their survival is crucial for their protection and conservation. This paper provides the first review for 12years on organic pollutants in bats and aims to investigate trends and any new issues impacting bat resilience. Organochlorine (OC) pesticides have been reported most often, especially in the older literature, with the dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) metabolite, dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), present at highest concentrations in tissues analyzed. The OC pesticide concentrations reported in bat tissues have declined significantly since the late 1970s, presumably as a result of restrictions in use. For example, DDE study mean concentrations over time periods 1970–1980, 1981–1999 and 2000–2013 ranged from 2.6-62, 0.05–2.31, 0.08–0.19ppm wet weight, respectively. Exposure, however, still occurs from remaining residues, many years after the compounds have been actively used. In recent years (2000–2013), a range of other organic chemicals have been reported in bat tissues including brominated flame retardants (polybrominated diphenyl ether at a mean concentration of 2.9ppm lipid weight) and perfluorinated compounds (perfluorooctanyl sulfonate at a mean concentration 0.09ppm wet weight). The persistent organic compounds concentrate in tissues with higher fat content notably back-depot fat. Numerous factors influence exposure, residues detected and concentrations in different individuals, species and tissues which must be understood to provide meaningful assessment of the impacts of exposure. Exposure can lead to not only acute and lethal impacts, but also physiological sub-lethal and chronic effects, often linked to the annual cycle of fat deposition and withdrawal. Current challenges for bat conservation include collation of a more extensive and standardized database of bat exposure, especially to current use pesticides and emerging contaminants, and better prediction and definition of toxicity end points notably for the sub-lethal effects. Understanding sub-lethal effects will be of greater importance for sustaining populations in the longer-term.","Bats,Organic contaminants,Pesticides,Mortality,"
"psr-based feature adaptation with anomaly re-prediction for maritime target tracking","2022","The tracking method for the relevant filter cannot track when the target is affected by the background and in the scene of occlusion. We propose a target tracking algorithm based on the peak-to-sidelobe ratio (PSR) feature weight adaptation with anomaly re-detection based on the efficient convolution operator for manual features (ECO_HC) algorithm. The weights of the HOG features and CN features corresponding to the peak-to-sidelobe ratio are used as dynamic weight coefficients, and the maximum response value after their fusion is the area where the target may appear. Determine the target tracking status by calculating the tracking confidence of the response map, and when there is a tracking anomaly, the ECO_HC tracker is enhanced using the Kalman filter to re-predict the target position. The proposed algorithm has experimented on the OTB-50 dataset. The results show that our algorithm can cope with complex scenarios and improves by 3.0% in tracking accuracy and 2.8% in tracking success rate compared with the baseline algorithm ECO_HC. Finally, conduct tracking experiments on the actual sea surface scenes, and the proposed algorithm effectively suppresses the effects of common interference factors on the tracking effect.","response map,anomaly re-detection,tracking success rate,baseline algorithm ECO_HC,Kalman filter,Kalman filters,tracking anomaly,Prediction algorithms,target tracking status,PSR-based feature adaptation,dynamic weight coefficients,tracking confidence,maximum response value,ECO_HC tracker,tracking effect,Filtering algorithms,Filtering,feature dynamic fusion,target tracking,actual sea surface scenes,efficient convolution operator,object tracking,HOG features,manual features algorithm,relevant filter,target position,Target tracking,correlation filter,feature extraction,tracking method,Sea surface,target tracking algorithm,weight adaptation,anomaly prediction,CN features,Anomaly Re-Prediction,Interference,maritime target tracking,Heuristic algorithms,peak-to-sidelobe ratio,"
"mobile data fusion from multiple tracking sensors to augment maritime safety: mobile detection, early identification, and tracking of moving objects","2015","We present a novel mobile solution to provide efficient services for data fusion towards augmenting maritime safety. It is the first, to the best authors knowledge, complex and integrated fusion of data coming from multiple mobile and typical tracking sensors (e.g. Low weight/high performance radar, position transmission mechanisms and electro-optic/systems and hyper-spectral sensors). The key aim is to assist the detection and early identification and tracking of moving targets (e.g. With moving target indication and data fusion/correlation capabilities), as well as methods for obstacle detection and maritime surveillance. Maritime mobile services have to exchange real time data with multiple maritime/aerial assets no matter where the operation is conducted (close to harbors or at the open sea) and independently from the existing surveillance infrastructure. The proposed approach is also useful for the detection of marine pollution incidents. This innovative single window solution presents high efficiency, low operational costs' profiles and possibly contributes to standardization in construction as it utilizes typical tracking infrastructure and typical mobile devices (smartphones and tablets/ipads) & PCs.","real time data exchange,Mobile Vessel Surveillance,surveillance,surveillance infrastructure,sensor fusion,mobile geoinformatics,maritime/aerial assets,Safety,correlation capabilities,image motion analysis,Mobile Maritime Security,Cameras,Marine vehicles,Mobile Geoinformatics,multiple tracking sensors,Mobile communication,geophysical image processing,moving objects tracking,object tracking,marine safety,marine engineering,maritime surveillance,object detection,mobile computing,early identification,Radar tracking,Prototypes,obstacle detection,geographic information systems,marine pollution incidents detection,correlation methods,marine pollution,maritime mobile services,mobile detection,moving target indication,mobile data fusion,maritime safety,"
"a distributed spatial method for modeling maritime routes","2020","In this work we propose a novel spatial knowledge discovery pipeline capable of automatically unravelling the â€œroads of the seaâ€ and maritime traffic patterns by analysing voluminous vessel tracking data, as collected through the Automatic Identification System (AIS).

"green, grey and black: a comparative study of sierra de las navajas (mexico) and lipari (italy) obsidians","2018","Sierra de Las Navajas (State of Hidalgo, Mexico) and Lipari (Aeolian Islands, Italy) were among the most important sources for obsidian trade in Mesoamerica and in the Mediterranean during the Stone Age. In this paper obsidians from these two localities were compared in terms of their aspect, chemical composition, microcrystallinity and microvesiculation. In Sierra de las Navajas, the typical deep green obsidian with a golden hue has been analyzed together with a less common dark grey, porphyritic variety. Lipari obsidian is commonly black, but a light grey variety also occurs. Obsidian of both varieties was analyzed for this paper. Microvesicularity was investigated through Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) observation, microporosimetry and, for Sierra de las Navajas green obsidian, through a preliminary X-ray computed microtomographic study. Crystallinity and micro- or nano-crystallinity were investigated through X-Ray Powder Diffraction and EDS (Energy Dispersion System) microanalyses. Finally, the chemical composition in terms of major and trace elements, including rare earth elements, was determined using X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) and Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS). The comparison of samples of different colors suggests that the characteristic green color of Sierra de las Navajas obsidians could be related to their relatively high iron content, and to the occurrence of many elongated and iso-oriented vesicles which may also be responsible for the obsidian's golden hue. Low iron and an absence of vesicles give Lipari obsidian its “normal” black color. The light grey obsidian from Lipari probably owes its color and imperfect conchoidal fracture to numerous bubbles of less than 1 μm in size and to nano-crystallinity. Sierra de las Navajas obsidians show a significant chemical variability in terms of trace elements, that can be explained by common evolutionary processes in the magma chamber. However, this variability is also internal to a single volcanic complex and this makes the trace element contents unsuitable to differentiating between the different sub-sources of the same area. On Lipari, our data do not allow us to distinguish between the two sub-sources of Vallone del Gabellotto and Canneto Dentro on the basis of major and trace elements. On the whole, our study suggests that caution should be used for both Lipari and Sierra de las Navajas when identifying obsidian sub-sources on the basis of trace element contents.","Sierra de las Navajas (Mexico),XRF and ICP-MS analyses,Obsidian source analyses,Lipari (Aeolian Islands),Obsidian color,Microvesiculation,Microtexture,"
"global navigation satellite systems performance analysis and augmentation strategies in aviation","2017","In an era of significant air traffic expansion characterized by a rising congestion of the radiofrequency spectrum and a widespread introduction of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are being exposed to a variety of threats including signal interferences, adverse propagation effects and challenging platform-satellite relative dynamics. Thus, there is a need to characterize GNSS signal degradations and assess the effects of interfering sources on the performance of avionics GNSS receivers and augmentation systems used for an increasing number of mission-essential and safety-critical aviation tasks (e.g., experimental flight testing, flight inspection/certification of ground-based radio navigation aids, wide area navigation and precision approach). GNSS signal deteriorations typically occur due to antenna obscuration caused by natural and man-made obstructions present in the environment (e.g., elevated terrain and tall buildings when flying at low altitude) or by the aircraft itself during manoeuvring (e.g., aircraft wings and empennage masking the on-board GNSS antenna), ionospheric scintillation, Doppler shift, multipath, jamming and spurious satellite transmissions. Anyone of these phenomena can result in partial to total loss of tracking and possible tracking errors, depending on the severity of the effect and the receiver characteristics. After designing GNSS performance threats, the various augmentation strategies adopted in the Communication, Navigation, Surveillance/Air Traffic Management and Avionics (CNS + A) context are addressed in detail. GNSS augmentation can take many forms but all strategies share the same fundamental principle of providing supplementary information whose objective is improving the performance and/or trustworthiness of the system. Hence it is of paramount importance to consider the synergies offered by different augmentation strategies including Space Based Augmentation System (SBAS), Ground Based Augmentation System (GBAS), Aircraft Based Augmentation System (ABAS) and Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM). Furthermore, by employing multi-GNSS constellations and multi-sensor data fusion techniques, improvements in availability and continuity can be obtained. SBAS is designed to improve GNSS system integrity and accuracy for aircraft navigation and landing, while an alternative approach to GNSS augmentation is to transmit integrity and differential correction messages from ground-based augmentation systems (GBAS). In addition to existing space and ground based augmentation systems, GNSS augmentation may take the form of additional information being provided by other on-board avionics systems, such as in ABAS. As these on-board systems normally operate via separate principles than GNSS, they are not subject to the same sources of error or interference. Using suitable data link and data processing technologies on the ground, a certified ABAS capability could be a core element of a future GNSS Space-Ground-Aircraft Augmentation Network (SGAAN). Although current augmentation systems can provide significant improvement of GNSS navigation performance, a properly designed and flight-certified SGAAN could play a key role in trusted autonomous system and cyber-physical system applications such as UAS Sense-and-Avoid (SAA).","Differential GNSS,High-integrity systems,Aerospace electronic systems,Air navigation,Avionics,Integrity monitoring,GNSS augmentation,Cyber-physical systems,Ground based augmentation system,Receiver autonomous integrity monitoring,Safety-critical aviation applications,Aircraft based augmentation system,Aviation security,GNSS performance,Global navigation satellite system,Satellite based augmentation system,"
"forecasting the impact of an 1859-calibre superstorm on satellite resources","2006","We have developed simple models to assess the economic impacts to the current satellite resource caused by the worst-case scenario of a hypothetical superstorm event occurring during the next sunspot cycle. Although the consequences may be severe, our worse-case scenario does not include the complete failure of the entire 937 operating satellites in the current population, which have a replacement value of ∼$170–230 billion, and supporting a ∼$90 billion/year industry. Our estimates suggest a potential economic loss of <$70 billion for lost revenue (∼$44 billion) and satellite replacement for GEO satellites (∼$24 billion) caused by a ‘once a century’ single storm similar to the 1859 superstorm. We estimate that 80 satellites (LEO, MEO, and GEO) may be disabled as a consequence of a superstorm event. Additional impacts may include the failure of many of the GPS, GLONASS, and Galileo satellite systems in MEO. Approximately 97 LEO satellites, which normally would not have re-entered for many decades, may prematurely de-orbit by ca 2021 as a result of the temporarily increased atmospheric drag caused by a superstorm event occurring in ca. 2012. The $100 billion International Space Station may lose significant altitude, placing it in critical need for re-boosting by an amount potentially outside the range of typical Space Shuttle operations, which are in any case scheduled to end in 2010. Currently, the ability to forecast extreme particle events and coronal mass ejections, or predict their fluences and geoseverity in the 24-h prior to the event, appears to be no better than 50/50. Our analysis of economic impacts is a first attempt at estimation whose approach will suggest ways in which better estimates may eventually be obtained.","Satellite anomalies,Radiation sickness,Technology impacts,Satellite failures,Space weather,Superstorms,Economic impacts,"
"dynamic effective connectivity network based on change points detection","2022","Human brain networks can be modeled as a system of interconnected brain regions which are recorded by time-dependent observations with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In order to spot trends, detect anomalies, and interpret the temporal dynamics, it is essential to understand the connections among distinct brain regions, and how these connections evolve over time. However, the change points of dynamic reorganization in brain connectivity are unknown, which may occur frequently during the scanning session. In this paper, we introduce a fused lasso regression approach to detect the number and position of rapid connectivity changes of subject and subsequently estimate the brain effective connectivity networks within each state phase lying between consecutive change points by conditional Granger causality method from fMRI time series data. The performance of the method is verified via numerical simulations and the obtained classification accuracy with support vector machine (SVM) was 86.24% in 140 subjects from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Compared with static EC model and conventional dynamic EC model based on sliding window technique, the experimental results show that the fused lasso achieved better classification effect, which probably due to better dynamic description. The result shows that the dynamic effective connectivity based on change points detected by fused lasso method is a better feature for classification.","Alzheimer’s disease (AD),Dynamic brain connectivity,Granger causality analysis,Change points detection,Fused lasso regression,"
"a search strategy and vessel detection in maritime environment using fixed-wing uavs","2023","In this paper, we address the problem of autonomous search and vessel detection in an unknown GNSS-denied maritime environment with fixed-wing UAVs. The main challenge in such environments with limited localization, communication range, and the total number of UAVs and sensors is to implement an appropriate search strategy so that a target vessel can be detected as soon as possible. Thus we present informed and non-informed methods used to search the environment. The informed method relies on an obtained probabilistic map, while the non-informed method navigates the UAVs along predefined paths computed with respect to the environment. The vessel detection method is trained on synthetic data collected in the simulator with data annotation tools. Comparative experiments in simulation have shown that our combination of sensors, search methods and a vessel detection algorithm leads to a successful search for the target vessel in such challenging environments.","detection,target vessel,fixed-wing UAVs,unknown GNSS-denied maritime environment,Location awareness,MBZIRC,informed method,marine environment,Search problems,autonomous search,search methods,appropriate search strategy,satellite navigation,vessel detection method,noninformed method,Probabilistic logic,simulation,Annotations,autonomous aerial vehicles,search strategy,search problems,communication range,mobile robots,successful search,vessel detection algorithm,Computational modeling,Sensors,Navigation,fixed-wing UAV,"
"sperm whale (physeter macrocephalus) acoustic ecology at ocean station papa in the gulf of alaska – part 1: detectability and seasonality","2019","Sperm whales Physeter macrocephalus produce loud, stereotypical click sequences and are an ideal species to be studied with passive acoustic techniques. To increase our limited knowledge of sperm whale occurrence patterns in remote and inaccessible locations of the North Pacific, we analyzed a five-year-long (June 2007–April 2012) acoustic data set recorded at Ocean Station PAPA (OSP; 50°N, 145°W) in the Gulf of Alaska (GOA). Firstly, we assessed the sperm whale detection performance of the Passive Aquatic Listener (PAL), and secondly, we investigated temporal patterns of sperm whale presence at OSP. The PAL proved highly efficient, with above 50% probability of detecting more than two sperm whales, a condition met for over 50% of the recordings. Results indicated that sperm whale clicks were recorded year-round, with a clear seasonal pattern. The number of detections during the summer months was approximately 70% higher compared to winter. An ambient noise analysis showed that differences in detection rates were likely not driven by seasonal changes in ambient noise levels. The average propagation range of sperm whale clicks ranged between 7 and 8 km between summer and winter, with slightly decreased detection distances observed in winter. Seasonal shifts in the intensity of the Alaska Current and the latitudinal oscillations of the North Pacific Transition Zone results in changes in water mixing, transport of nutrients and the concentration of prey such as squid, which likely drives sperm whale distribution.","Ocean Station PAPA,Sperm whale (),North Pacific Transition Zone,Passive Aquatic Listener,Gulf of Alaska,Passive Acoustic Monitoring,Seasonality,"
"experimental comparison of ad hoc methods for classification of maritime vessels based on real-life ais data","2018","Classification of Maritime Vessels is a recurrent task in maritime surveillance systems. Classification can be conducted by different methods, e.g., NaÃ¯ve Bayes, k Nearest Neighbor, Decision Tree, Fuzzy Rule, or Neural Networks.

By broadcasting of navigational data and ships' information it supports maritime safety, surveillance, and information. Based on measured AIS datasets of five maritime hotspots, easily implementable standard classification (i.e. ad hoc) methods from Data Science are compared to each other. These are evaluated in terms of accuracy. This experimental evaluation is motivated by the following question: Tip to which degree properties and behavior, e.g., vessel's type, can be detected by using large quantities of ship's positional, motion, and dimensions' data as provided by AIS?

"a holistic provenance and microwear study of pre-colonial jade objects from the virgin islands: unravelling mobility networks in the wider caribbean","2022","Pre-colonial Caribbean jade objects from the National Museum of Denmark Hatt Collection were subjected to a provenance and microwear analysis. Thirty-nine jade celts and bodily ornaments from the US Virgin Islands, i.e., St. Croix, St. Thomas, St. John, and five celts from the West Indies of unknown location, St. Vincent, Cuba and the Dominican Republic were analysed. A comprehensive in-depth examination of jade adornments from St. Croix, combining typo-technological and microwear analysis, is compared to other lithologies used for pre-colonial ornaments. A portable laser ablation system was used to sample jade celts and bodily ornaments on site in a quasi-non-destructive manner. Low-blank trace element and Sr-Nd isotope ratio data were evaluated with a multiclass regression provenance prediction model. This study demonstrates that the pan-Caribbean exchange of jade raw materials, pre-forms or finished objects during the Ceramic Age (400 BC to AD 1492) occurred on a more complex scale than previously thought involving jade sources in Guatemala, eastern Cuba and the northern Dominican Republic. In addition, the study of ornaments recovered from St. Croix reveals use of specific lithologies suggesting stronger ties to Indigenous communities on Puerto Rico than other Lesser Antillean Islands.","Microwear analysis,Portable laser ablation sampling,Mobility networks,Provenance analyses,Pre-colonial jade artefacts,Virgin Islands,"
"maritime opportunistic transmission: when and how much can dtn node deliver?","2019","Maritime wireless communication delay tolerant networks (MWDTN) may develop slowly, if there is no efficient scheme to allocate network resources which are arrival data and limited energy.

In addition, we assume the node of delay tolerant networks (DTN) only uses green energy absorbed from the sun and wind. We establish a reasonable harvest-and-consumption energy model. Considering to make a delay-energy tradeoff, an optimization algorithm based on Lyapunov optimization (LO), which makes the transmission determination for waking-up the DTN node and determines the optimal data quantity should be transmitted for current system state, is proposed to cope with the delay-energy tradeoff problem.

"a generic anomaly detection approach applied to mixture-of-unigrams and maritime surveillance data","2019","This paper proposes a new generic method to detect anomalies (i.e., statistical outliers) which can be used with a generative topic model. In this paper, we specify this method in the context of the Mixture-of-unigrams model, which is widely used in text mining. It is possible to detect anomalies with a topic model by applying a threshold to the likelihood. However, it is challenging to choose the threshold since the choice needs to consider both the similarities of the topics and the length of documents. This paper describes a new intuitive method to detect anomalies which simply manipulates the output of the trained model. Such an approach is anticipated to have parameters that are more intuitive to define for a given problem. To assess the utility of the proposed approach, we also present a use case involving identifying ships misreporting their ship-type using geo-location data from the Automatic Identification System (AIS) messages.

"contaminants in two west greenland caribou populations","2016","Two caribou populations in West Greenland were sampled and the kidneys, liver and muscle analyzed for contaminants, including aluminum, arsenic, cadmium, copper, lead, mercury, selenium and zinc. Although close in proximity, the two populations are topographically separated by an ice cap, which creates different climates and vegetation types in each region. Contaminant levels reflected the differing diets of the two caribou populations. To the south in the wetter lichen-rich region, caribou had significantly more aluminum, arsenic, cadmium, lead, mercury, selenium and zinc, likely due to atmospheric deposition on lichens. To the north in the dry desert steppe where grasses predominate, caribou had higher levels of copper. Cows collected in late winter had significantly less hepatic copper, lead and mercury if pregnant, indicating placental transfer of these elements. Our results suggest that hepatic copper levels <200μgg−1 dry weight may result in copper depletion in pregnant cows and hepatic mercury concentrations above 0.5μgg−1 dry weight may negatively affect fertility in caribou cows. Hepatic mercury levels were negatively correlated with cow body weight, suggesting an adverse effect on body condition. Element concentrations found in tissues from these caribou are not considered to be of a health concern for those consuming this traditional food.","Copper,Lead,Selenium,Mercury,Cadmium,Caribou,"

"a preliminary study on an optical system for nautical and maritime traffic monitoring","2021","The nautical traffic is very difficult to monitor since many vessels are not cooperative. VTSs (Vessel Traffic Systems) use several sources of information for estimating shipsâ€™ Position Navigation and Velocity, such as AIS (Automatic Identification System) and RADAR (RAdio Detection And Ranging); nevertheless, VTS areas do not cover the entire costal area of a country. In many cases the classification and identification of small non-AIS vessels could provide an important to the safety of navigation.Indeed, especially during the summer, the nautical tourism has a great impact on the maritime traffic congestion. The issue involves many institutions such as Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) and local maritime authorities which are not able to monitor the high volume of nautical traffic. This work introduces an optical system designed to monitor the traffic in small coastal areas based on images acquired by a single camera. The reliability and accuracy of the system is conditioned by the size of the pixel on the sea surface (Ground Sample Distance-GSD) and by the camera footprint area as well.

"feasibility of investment in blue growth multiple-use of space and multi-use platform projects; results of a novel assessment approach and case studies","2019","Blue Growth is the creation of economic activity and jobs at sea, while multiple use of space makes efficient use of the available sea area by combining industries. Clearly there are many combinations and many value propositions. However, most technologies to date are considered blue sky concepts, with little robust techno-economic analysis demonstrating profitability. The paper begins by providing a comprehensive review of Blue Growth and multi-use in Blue Growth; both in policy as well as the wide range of current technologies, including ocean energy, offshore wind energy, offshore aquaculture and desalination. The Maribe H2020 project provides the vehicle for the research element of the paper. The major contribution is a new methodology for selecting, filtering, developing and ranking business propositions for multiple-use of space (MUS) and multi-use platforms (MUP). Application of the method for the first time identified three case studies where Blue Growth combination projects can be economically viable, with attractive internal rate of return (IRRs). Results presented for the case studies report standard investment metrics and show the relative contribution of each product (energy, food, water) to the system profitability, as well as socio-economic impact. Existing companies were fully engaged in the process. Co-creation between sector experts and industry led to both improved business value propositions and robust assessment of investment readiness. In contrast to the presumption that large scale platforms are commercially attractive, the highest ranking case study companies required smaller capital expenditure (CAPEX) and operated in niche subsectors. In conclusion, the positive economic performance of the case studies should provide confidence for the EC as well as investors that MUS and MUP have viable economic futures leading towards commercialisation. The macro and micro assessment methods will be particularly useful in other Blue Economy contexts and in other multiple product contexts.","Aquaculture,Multi-use platform,Blue Growth,Techno-economics,Multiple-use of space,Ocean energy,"
"multi-armed bandits learning for task offloading in maritime edge intelligence networks","2022","In the context of complex and dynamic marine environment, the offloading of computing tasks for ships of Internet of Things (IoT) users is a very challenging problem considering the different quality of service (QoS) requirements of maritime applications. Mobile edge computing driven by powerful computing capability and edge intelligence is taken as a promising solution, especially for the resource-constrained and delay-sensitive maritime IoT users. In this paper, we study the optimal edge server selection problem for ship IoT users to jointly minimize the latency and energy consumption for task offloading. Specifically, we first propose a novel space-air-ground-edge (SAGE) integrated maritime network architecture to offload computation-intensive IoT services at sea. Then, the latency and energy consumption of data transmission and processing during offloading are modelled. Based on the models, the edge server selection problem is formulated into a Multi-Armed Bandits learning problem, with considering the task latency requirement and energy budget. To achieve the optimal solution, a novel algorithm, referred to as UCB1-ESSS, is developed, which links the latency, energy consumption, and network constraints by introducing both reward and cost. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve considerably lower offloading latency and weighted latency-energy cost compared with the traditional algorithms under different QoS requirements, which proves the efficacy of theproposed algorithm.","edge intelligence,multi-armed bandits,resource-constrained,dynamic marine environment,data transmission,Internet of Things,Energy consumption,quality of service,Marine vehicles,Delays,ship IoT users,maritime edge intelligence networks,task latency requirement,powerful computing capability,energy budget,Things users,Servers,marine ship IoT users,cloud computing,MultiArmed Bandits,latency-energy cost,optimisation,mobile computing,mobile edge computing,network constraints,Computing offloading,computation-intensive IoT services,considerably lower offloading latency,maritime applications,complex environment,task offloading,energy consumption,optimal edge server selection problem,delay-sensitive maritime IoT users,computational complexity,maritime wireless networks,Computational modeling,optimal solution,Task analysis,Internet,learning (artificial intelligence),resource allocation,service requirements,novel space-air-ground-edge integrated maritime network architecture,"
"maritime structures and ships lightning protection","2007","This paper investigates and demonstrates a developed technique to use the collection volume method (CVM) for the placement of either conventional or non-conventional lightning protection systems (LPS) for ships. Each lightning eliminator assigned a striking distance, which is calculated as a function of ship height, radius of curvature, ship location, ship dimensions, risk factor, and lightning related parameters. This novel technique was applied to a medium war ship, Cargo, destroyer, as well as an air craft carrier, and showed to be a very efficient mean for lightning protection for these ships. For some design cases, a hybrid system was chosen to be the most efficient and the less expensive system.","risk factor,Electric breakdown,ships lightning protection,Radar antennas,Marine vehicles,Rubber,Design methodology,ship location,ship dimensions,ships,Electronic equipment,collection volume method,Shape,Contacts,lightning protection,risk analysis,air craft carrier,Conductivity,lightning related parameters,Lightning protection,"
"understanding global spatio-temporal trends and the relationship between vegetation greenness and climate factors by land cover during 1982–2014","2020","Analysis of the correlation between vegetation greenness and climate variable trends is important in the study of vegetation greenness. Our study used Normalized Difference Vegetation Index-3rd generation data from the Advanced Very High-Resolution Radiometer - Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies (AVHRR-GIMMS NDVI3g), land cover data from the Climate Change Initiative (CCI-LC), and climate data from the Climatic Research Unit global time series (CRU TS) of climate variables (temperature and precipitation, solar radiation) over the past 33 years. First, we estimated the overall trends for vegetation greenness and climate variables over five time periods. Second, we subjected the data to correlation, regression, and residual analyses to detect correlations between vegetation greenness and different climate variables. Third, we extracted trends and correlation results by primary land cover types for each climate zone. Our study was focused at the global scale, and findings indicate that the largest decreasing trend of vegetation greenness and grasslands occurred in the mid-latitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere and in parts of South America, Africa, Saudi Arabia, and south and northeast Asia. In particular, the cold climatic zones of forest (36.6%), cropland (36.6%), and grassland (14.1%) suffered significant decline in vegetation greenness. Anthropogenic activities are mainly responsible for declining vegetation greenness particularly in northern Africa, central and western Asia. However, residual analysis shows an increase in vegetation greenness in some parts of western Europe, southern Australia, and the northern part of South America. The study also identified temperature and precipitation as the main factors responsible for controlling vegetation growth. Hot-spot areas with the largest temperature increases were found in the Amazon, Central America, southern Greenland, east Africa, south-east Asia, and other areas. However, temperatures decreased in the western part of South America, Angola, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Papua New Guinea. Precipitation decreased the most from March to May over most parts of the world with high correlation (r = 0.88) in Russia Canada, northeast Asia, and central Africa. In general, climate factors were the principal drivers of the variation in vegetation greenness globally in recent years.","Vegetation greenness trends,Land cover,Correlation,Precipitation,Global,Temperature,"
"development and deployment of multi-mission intelligent autonomous maritime systems","2020","Cherokee Nation Strategic Programs (CNSP) and Ocean Aero, Inc. have teamed together to demonstrate the multi-mission capabilities of commercial autonomous maritime systems. CNSP has a proven record testing, fielding, and developing Unmanned Systems (UxS) programs across air, ground, and maritime domains. Ocean Aero has developed a portfolio of intelligent autonomous underwater and surface vehicles that are uniquely engineered for a wide range of applications above and below the ocean surface. The focus of our collaboration is the accelerated deployment of autonomous capabilities in operational mission scenarios. Unmanned systems are demonstrating daily value to commercial and civilian users today. Drones are rapidly moving beyond powerful remotely controlled information capture tools into advanced networks of aerial robots providing services and access that was never before considered valuable. Ground robot technologies are maturing just as rapidly and taking on many different forms as purpose-built systems are enabling subterranean exploration, driver safety on interstate highways, and disaster response support. Maritime systems are now fulfilling the same potential with robust, all-weather designs that enable long endurance, rugged missions for marine users. The operational value that these systems provide comes from the advancements in intelligent autonomy. We are currently testing the range of autonomous capabilities of the Ocean Aero Triton Series autonomous underwater and surface vehicle systems at the University of Southern Mississippi Marine Research Center (USM MRC). The Ocean Aero vehicles are designed and built with autonomous, persistent navigation capabilities as a standard feature. Additional customized, mission-centric sensors may be added to the systems to accomplish specific operational tasks and/or increase autonomous performance. The command-and-control (C2) communication architecture provides situational awareness and mission progress monitoring for the onboard vehicle decision-making, as well as the remote operator control station. To successfully achieve the high level of autonomous operations in locations without terrestrial communications (cellular) and beyond visual line of sight, UxS use satellite communications for navigation and mission data transfer. Our testing is evaluating the ability of the autonomous systems to accomplish multiple missions, including perimeter security, tracking of other surface vehicles, environmental monitoring, and marine science missions. These evaluations include the performance of the vehicles, the sensors, and the multi-domain communication systems, while characterizing the operating conditions for each test series. â€œAutonomyâ€ is a capability that means different things to different people. Our testing at the MRC is evaluating the ability of the system to react to new information, whether from external source or self-perceived, to accomplish the intended mission, such as detection of an unknown vehicle in the area. This ability to react includes concepts such as dynamic replanning for navigation, as well as communications with the operations center for mission management awareness. Through these communications and activities, we are measuring the operator workloads in multiple missions to determine if the autonomy in the system is increasing, decreasing, or improving operator performance. Our testing team was assembled specifically to accomplish these objectives. The full technical paper will include sample test cases and data collection examples for evaluating the Ocean Aero autonomous underwater and surface vehicle technologies using the Cherokee Nation Capabilities-Based Assessment process. This is the proven, repeatable process that we have used for evaluating air, ground, and maritime unmanned systems for many customers. We use this process for assessing the operational performance of mature products, not research-only test units. This focus on technologies that are commercially available or at least products from an active production line, allow us to evaluate capabilities as they relate to mission requirements and user objectives. We have the team with the experience, the equipment, the facilities, and the dedication to advance the expectations of what is possible for unmanned maritime systems. This paper covers the process for achieving that advancement, including identifying the challenges such as evaluating autonomous capabilities and operating in live environments.","research-only test units,Ocean Aero vehicles,Vehicle dynamics,operational value,autonomous navigation capabilities,mission progress monitoring,Cherokee Nation capabilities-based assessment process,UxS,remotely controlled information capture tools,Sensor systems,ocean surface,unmanned maritime systems,ground robot technologies,autonomy,terrestrial communications,maritime unmanned systems,onboard vehicle decision-making,command-and-control communication architecture,mission data transfer,satellite communication,multidomain communication systems,Testing,Vehicles,command-and-control,mission requirements,purpose-built systems,BVLOS,autonomous underwater vehicles,rugged missions,Sea surface,telecontrol,multimission intelligent autonomous maritime systems,testing team,data collection examples,CNSP,sensors,decision making,intelligent autonomy,persistent navigation capabilities,situational awareness,surface vehicle technologies,command and control systems,visual line of sight,path planning,mission management awareness,satellite communications,unmanned surface vehicles,mobile robots,sample test cases,test and evaluation,unmanned systems,UXS,Visualization,customized mission-centric sensors,maritime domains,Tools,surface vehicles,operational mission scenarios,surface vehicle systems,remote operator control station,University of Southern Mississippi Marine Research Center,Cherokee Nation Strategic Programs,intelligent autonomous underwater vehicles,"

"double-constrained rpca based on saliency maps for foreground detection in automated maritime surveillance","2015","The development of automated video-surveillance applications for maritime environment is a very difficult task due to the complexity of the scenes: moving water, waves, etc. The motion of the objects of interest (i.e. ships or boats) can be mixed with the dynamic behavior of the background (non-regular patterns). In this paper, a double-constrained Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA), named SCM-RPCA (Shape and Confidence Map-based RPCA), is proposed to improve the object foreground detection in maritime scenes. The sparse component is constrained by shape and confidence maps both extracted from spatial saliency maps.

"a cloud based architecture capable of perceiving and predicting multiple vessel behaviour","2015","Progressively huge amounts of data, tracking vessels during their voyages across the seas, are becoming available, mostly due to the automatic identification system (AIS) that vessels of specific categories are required to carry. These datasets provide detailed insights into the patterns vessels follow, while safely navigating across the globe, under various conditions. In this paper, we develop an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) capable of predicting a vessels future behaviour (position, speed and course), based on events that occur in a predictable pattern, across large map areas. The main concept of this study is to determine if an ANN is capable of inferring the unique behavioural patterns that each vessel follows and successively use this as a means for predicting multiple vessel behaviour into a future point in time. We design, train and implement a proof of concept ANN, as a cloud based web application, with the ability of overlaying predicted short and long term vessel behaviour on an interactive map. Our proposed approach could potentially assist in busy port scheduling, vessel route planning, anomaly detection and increasing overall Maritime Domain Awareness.","Vessel behaviour prediction,Soft computing applications,Artificial Neural Network,Automated identification system,Maritime Domain Awareness,"
"gnss integrity concepts for maritime users","2019","Some of the most important parameters of operational requirements for Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) are integrity, continuity, accuracy, availability and coverage. These requirements, most strictly formalized in aviation, are based on risk analysis, considering risk exposure time and critical risk exposure time. However, the GNSS user requirements in maritime domain are still not clearly set. GNSS offers worldwide coverage at a sufficient position data quality and though other means of ship's position fixing are available at sea, the use of GNSS devices is generally the most preferred method of producing valid position data. Primary means for electronic position fixing currently in use in majority of merchant ships are shipborne autonomous GPS receivers or DGPS IALA receivers. More advanced GNSS receivers able to process signals from GPS, GLONASS, Chinese Beidou, European Galileo, regional Indian IRNSS, and satellite based augmentation systems (SBAS) are still rare. But it is expected that such combined or multi-system receivers will soon become more common in maritime transport.To be prepared for a malfunction of any GNSS devices for maritime applications and e-Navigation specifically, their state of the art integrity monitoring should be developed and standardized analogously to other transport domains. The issues of existing requirements, performance standards, and future concepts of maritime GNSS integrity are discussed in this paper.","satellite based augmentation systems,operational requirements,integrity monitoring,GNSS,Radio navigation,Receivers,Standards,electronic position fixing,e-Navigation,maritime GNSS integrity,Monitoring,integrity,Global Navigation Satellite System,PNT,Global navigation satellite system,marine navigation,Global Positioning System,maritime users,"
"a comprehensive maritime benchmark dataset for detection, tracking and threat recognition","2021","This paper describes a new multimodal maritime dataset recorded using a multispectral suite of sensors, including AIS, GPS, radar, and visible and thermal cameras. The visible and thermal cameras are mounted on the vessel itself and surveillance is performed around the vessel in order to protect it from piracy at sea. The dataset corresponds to a series of acted scenarios which simulate attacks to the vessel by small, fast-moving boats (â€˜skiffsâ€™). The scenarios are inspired by real piracy incidents at sea and present a range of technical challenges to the different stages in an automated surveillance system: object detection, object tracking, and event recognition (in this case, threats towards the vessel). The dataset can thus be employed for training and testing at several stages of a threat detection and classification system. We also present in this paper baseline results that can be used for benchmarking algorithms performing such tasks. This new dataset fills a lack of publicly available datasets for the development and testing of maritime surveillance applications.","comprehensive maritime benchmark dataset,Benchmark testing,visible cameras,Thermal sensors,Sensor phenomena and characterization,computer crime,multimodal maritime dataset,thermal cameras,classification system,automated surveillance system,object tracking,cameras,object detection,image classification,Radar,marine engineering computing,event recognition,maritime surveillance applications,Boats,Object detection,Surveillance,video surveillance,threat recognition,threat detection,piracy incidents,"
"bistatic sar maritime ship target 3-d image reconstruction method without distortion in local cartesian coordinate","2023","Bistatic synthetic aperture radar (BiSAR) has been attracting worldwide attention because of its forward-looking imaging and high anti-interference. In harsh environment, it is vital for BiSAR to conduct extensive surveillance, imaging, and recognition of maritime ship targets. However, under the disturbance of sea waves, the ship target has an unknown and massive 3-D rotation, so that its imaging projection plane (IPP) is also undetermined. Thus, high-dimensional random distortion appears in imaging results, making it difficult to recognize the target through 2-D distorted images effectively. To solve these problems, BiSAR maritime ship target 3-D image reconstruction method without distortion in local Cartesian coordinate (LCC) is proposed. In this article, according to positions of scatterers and rotation parameters, significant differences of different scatterers of maritime ship targets have been found in bistatic range, Doppler centroid (DC), and Doppler frequency rate (DFR), which lays a solid foundation for the scatterer separation of ship targets. On this basis, a 3-D R-DC-DFR domain is constructed, and 2-D echoes of the maritime ship target are projected into R-DC-DFR domain to separate scatterers. Then, by remapping data of transmitter and receiver in R-DC-DFR domain to LCC, as well as evaluating their similarity metric, the optimal rotation parameters of the ship target can be obtained via the maximal similarity. Therefore, the image distortion caused by the unknown IPP has been removed, and 3-D image reconstruction of ship targets can be realized without distortion in the LCC. Furthermore, to evaluate performances of 3-D image reconstruction for different rotation parameters and bistatic configurations, 3-D reconstruction index is proposed and analyzed. Both point-targets and maritime ship targets are simulated to emphasize the effectiveness of the proposed method.","local Cartesian coordinate,bistatic synthetic aperture radar (BiSAR),marine radar,R-DC-DFR domain,Image reconstruction,maritime ship target,Marine vehicles,bistatic SAR maritime ship target 3-D image reconstruction method,high-dimensional random distortion,Transmitters,Synthetic aperture radar,geophysical image processing,3-D reconstruction,ships,synthetic aperture radar,image distortion,image reconstruction,radar imaging,Doppler effect,BiSAR maritime ship target,2-D distorted images,imaging projection plane,Receivers,Imaging,point-targets,remote sensing by radar,local Cartesian coordinate (LCC),oceanographic techniques,"

"satellite detection of increasing northern hemisphere non-frozen seasons from 1979 to 2008: implications for regional vegetation growth","2012","The landscape freeze–thaw (FT) signal from satellite microwave remote sensing is closely linked to vegetation phenology and land–atmosphere trace gas exchange where seasonal frozen temperatures are a major constraint to plant growth. We applied a temporal change classification of 37GHz brightness temperature (Tb) series from the Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR) and Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) to classify daily FT status over global land areas where seasonal frozen temperatures influence ecosystem processes. A temporally consistent, long-term (30year) FT record was created, ensuring cross-sensor consistency through pixel-wise adjustment of the SMMR Tb record based on empirical analyses of overlapping SMMR and SSM/I measurements. The resulting FT record showed mean annual spatial classification accuracies of 91 (+/−8.6) and 84 (+/−9.3) percent for PM and AM overpass retrievals relative to in situ air temperature measurements from the global weather station network. The FT results were compared against other measures of biosphere activity including CO2 eddy flux tower measurements and satellite (MODIS) vegetation greenness (NDVI). The FT defined non-frozen season largely bounds the period of active vegetation growth and net ecosystem CO2 uptake for tower sites representing major biomes. Earlier spring thawing and longer non-frozen seasons generally benefit vegetation growth inferred from NDVI spring and summer growth anomalies where the non-frozen season is less than approximately 6months, with greater benefits at higher (>45°N) latitudes. A strong (P<0.001) increasing (0.189daysyr−1) trend in the Northern Hemisphere mean annual non-frozen season is largely driven by an earlier (−0.149daysyr−1) spring thaw trend and coincides with a 0.033°Cyr−1 regional warming trend. The FT record also shows a positive (0.199daysyr−1) trend in the number of transitional (AM frozen and PM non-frozen) frost days, which coincide with reduced vegetation productivity inferred from tower CO2 and MODIS NDVI measurements. The relative benefits of earlier and longer non-frozen seasons for vegetation growth under global warming may be declining due to opposing increases in disturbance, drought and frost damage related impacts.","ESDR,NDVI,CDR,Freeze thaw,SSM/I,Vegetation growing season,Phenology,SMMR,NASA MEaSUREs,Global warming,MODIS,Climate change,"
"augmented ship tracking under occlusion conditions from maritime surveillance videos","2020","Ship tracking provides crucial on-site microscopic kinematic traffic information which benefits maritime traffic flow analysis, ship safety enhancement, traffic control, etc., and thus has attracted considerable research attentions in the maritime surveillance community. Conventional ship tracking methods yield satisfied results by exploring distinct visual ship features in maritime images, which may fail when the target ship is partially or fully sheltered by obstacles (e.g., ships, waves, etc.) in maritime videos. To overcome the difficulty, we propose an augmented ship tracking framework via the kernelized correlation filter (KCF) and curve fitting algorithm. First, the KCF model is introduced to track ships in the consecutive maritime images and obtain raw ship trajectory dataset. Second, the data anomaly detection and rectification procedure are implemented to rectify the contaminated ship positions. For the purpose of performance evaluation, we implement the proposed framework and another three popular ship tracking models on the four typical ship occlusion videos. The experimental results show that our proposed framework successfully tracks ships in maritime video clips with high accuracy (i.e., the average root mean square error (RMSE), root mean square percentage error (RMSPE), mean absolute deviation (MAD) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) are less than 10), which significantly outperforms the other popular ship trackers.","Smart ship,maritime surveillance videos,Marine vehicles,Feature extraction,maritime traffic flow analysis,augmented ship tracking,ship trajectory dataset,on-site microscopic kinematic traffic information,visual ship features,Videos,kernelized correlation filter,object tracking,ships,marine safety,marine engineering,Target tracking,object detection,feature extraction,maritime images,Correlation,curve fitting algorithm,image filtering,video signal processing,Training,curve fitting,ship occlusion videos,data anomaly detection,Visualization,traffic control,ship occlusion,traffic engineering computing,ship safety enhancement,video surveillance,visual ship tracking,"

"spatio-temporal analysis of lightning activity over greece — preliminary results derived from the recent state precision lightning network","2014","Lightning is a natural phenomenon in the atmosphere, being a major cause of storm related deaths, main trigger of forest fires and affects many electrochemical systems of the body. Significant scientific interest has come up in the last decades, as numerous lightning detection networks have been established in operational basis, providing lightning data to assess and mitigate lightning impact to the local society by spatio-temporal analysis. In this study, a preliminary analysis of spatial and temporal variabilities of recorded lightnings over Greece during the period from January 2008 to December 2009 is presented. The data for retrieving the location and time-of-occurrence (TOA) of lightning were acquired from the Hellenic National Meteorological Service (HNMS). An operational precision lightning network (PLN) has been established since 2007 by HNMS, consisting of eight time-of-arrival (TOA) sensors, spatially distributed across Greek territory. The spatial variability of lightnings revealed their incidence within specific geographical sub-regions while the temporal variability concerns the seasonal and monthly distributions. All the analyses were carried out with respect to cloud to cloud (CC), cloud to ground (CG) and ground to cloud (GC) lightnings, within the examined time period. During the autumn season, lightning activity was the highest, followed by summer and spring.

"the 19 january 2013 windstorm over the north atlantic: large-scale dynamics and impacts on iberia","2014","On 19 January 2013 Portugal was once again on an extreme meteorological risk warning state due to the landfall of a rapidly deepening low pressure system exactly on the period of its maximum explosive development. This storm, named Gong, had a central minimum pressure of 968hPa, observed wind gusts of 140kmh−1 on some locations of the Portuguese coast and was responsible for the downfall of thousands of trees on some of the Portuguese national forests, the destruction of several hundred farms among other huge socioeconomic losses and fatalities. The large-scale synoptic conditions and dynamical characteristics of windstorm Gong, as well as the associated meteorological and socioeconomic adverse impacts are reviewed in this paper. For this purpose an objective lagrangean method, which identifies and follows individual lows, is applied for the assessment of the cyclone track and lifetime characteristics, which is complemented by the analysis of several thermohydrodynamical reanalysis fields during the lifetime of the cyclone. Results show that Gong underwent an explosive development with ‘bomb’ characteristics between the Azores and the Iberian Peninsula, with a deepening rate unusually high for these latitudes. The rapid deepening of Gong was supported by the southerly displacement of the polar jet stream; by a pronounced cyclonic potential vorticity streamer which approached Iberia from northwest; and by the presence of an atmospheric river over the western and central subtropical North Atlantic converging into Gong׳s genesis region and then crossing the Atlantic basin, moving along with the storm towards Iberia. Understanding the dynamics of these high impact extreme events may be of relevance in view of improving extreme forecasts as well as of public awareness, policy making and risk assessment and management of severe weather in Portugal.","Explosive cyclogenesis,Atmospheric river,Wind and precipitation extremes,Windstorm,Natural hazards,Iberia,"
"routeminer: mining ship routes from a massive maritime trajectories","2014","Mining trajectory data has been attracting significant interest in the last years. By analyzing trajectory data, we are able to discover the movement behavior and location-aware knowledge, and then develop many interesting applications such as movement behavior discovery, location prediction, traffic analysis, and so on. However, trajectory data mining is a challenge task because of the trajectory data is available with uncertainty. Furthermore, discovering the valuable knowledge from maritime trajectory is made even more difficult due to the maritime area is a free moving space. Unlike the vehicles' movements are constrained by road networks, there is no such a sea route for ships to follow in maritime area. A ship's movement may not exactly repeat the same trajectory even the ship has the similar movement behavior with others. In this work, Route Miner system provides a framework of ship route mining for maritime traffic analysis. Given a set of ship trajectories in a maritime area, Route Miner explore the movement behavior from those massive trajectories in a free moving space. Then, ship routes are detected based on those behavioral pattern. Finally, the system generates a set of ships routes to provide operators a better understanding from ship trajectory data. We conduct the experiments on real maritime trajectories to show the effectiveness of proposed Route Miner.

Specifically, an energy-limited delay tolerant networking (DTN) node deployed in the ocean receives/transmits data from/to vessels within its communication range. To further save the energy, a long-term energy minimization problem is formulated with sleeping scheduling and opportunistic transmission.

However a series of misuses of the AIS does exist, and data may lack reliability as some users broadcast errors or intentionally falsify the information sent by the device. In this respect, a methodology to assess the integrity and veracity of AIS messages has been developed, leading to the determination of maritime risks in support to maritime monitoring activities. In this paper, an exemplification is proposed, based on AIS possible integrity issues on kinematic data.","identification technology,maritime traffic,collaborative platforms,Marine vehicles,Monitoring,maritime domain awareness,AIS messages,Reliability,Sea measurements,compulsory collision prevention device,fishing pressure,maritime monitoring activities,ships,automatic identification system,maritime risks,marine safety,Automatic Identification System,data falsification,Artificial intelligence,large worldwide AIS datasets,risk analysis,vessel-born noise,Trajectory,marine communication,air pollution,Navigation,collision avoidance,AIS possible integrity issues,"
"new insight into internal waves for maritime applications: a novel optical method with ocean experimental results","2021","Internal waves generated by the movement of surface and subsurface vehicles in the ocean have specific importance in maritime applications. These types of waves are categorized as forced internal waves. In this article, an attempt using a novel optical method is made to study the forced internal waves that are generated by a large surface vehicle in a controlled sea exercise. The optical method uses a diode laser operating at 635 nm and a lateral-effect position-sensitive photodetector. The laser beam undergoes modulation in both its intensity and beam positions with respect to the density variations that are caused in the stratified ocean by the forced internal waves. The experimental scheme, the system aspect of the optical method, and supporting theoretical aspects are detailed with corroborating experimental results. It is observed that the frequency of the forced internal waves also remains within the band of naturally occurring ambient oscillations in the ocean. The obtained results indicate that the forced internal waves detected by the optical method can be used for detecting the movement of maritime vehicles in the ocean.","lateral-effect position-sensing photodetector,optical method,maritime vehicles movement,remotely operated vehicles,Surface waves,Measurement by laser beam,Optical sensors,ocean waves,lateral-effect position-sensitive photodetector,photodetectors,laser beam,Internal waves,diode laser,semiconductor lasers,maritime applications,laser beams,laser beam deflection,Laser beams,naturally occurring ambient oscillations,naval anti-submarine warfare (ASW) applications,forced internal waves,Refractive index,ocean optics,wavelength 635.0 nm,oceanographic techniques,ocean experimental results,"
"framestep: a framework for annotating semantic trajectories based on episodes","2018","We are witnessing an increasing usage of location data by a variety of applications. Consequently, information systems are required to deal with large datasets containing raw data to build high level abstractions. Semantic Web technologies offer powerful representation tools for pervasive applications. The convergence of location-based services and Semantic Web standards allows an easier interlinking and annotation of trajectories. However, due to the wide range of requirements on modeling mobile object trajectories, it is important to define a high-level data model for representing trajectory episodes and contextual elements with multiple levels of granularity and different options to represent spatial and temporal extents, as well as to express quantitative and qualitative semantic descriptions. In this article, we focus on modeling mobile object trajectories in the context of Semantic Web. First, we introduce a new version of the Semantic Trajectory Episodes (STEP) ontology to represent generic spatiotemporal episodes. Then, we present FrameSTEP as a new framework for annotating semantic trajectories based on episodes. As a result, we combine our ontology, which can represent spatiotemporal phenomena at different levels of granularity, with annotation algorithms, which allow to create instances of our model. The proposed spatial annotation algorithm explores the Linked Open Data cloud and OpenStreetMap tags to find relevant types of spatial features in order to describe the environment where the trajectory took place. Our framework can guide the development of future expert systems in trajectory analysis. It enables reasoning about knowledge gathered from large trajectory data and linked datasets in order to create several intelligent services.","Semantic web,Trajectory modeling,Trajectory annotation,"
"historical ais data-driven unsupervised automatic extraction of directional maritime traffic networks","2020","Vessel experience route analysis can provide empirical support for maritime traffic management. Recently, the application of the Automatic Identification System (AIS) provides multi-dimensional data about voyages and vessels. However, traditional route extraction methods do not take into account information such as the vessel traffic pattern and the density distribution in the channel. The experience routes obtained is not accurate enough. This paper proposes an unsupervised method for extracting vessel experience routes from historical AIS data. The method consists of three parts: vessel traffic pattern extraction, channel boundary extraction, channel triangle network construction and hottest route extraction. The method comprehensively considers the spatiotemporal information and density distribution of the vessel trajectories, and constructs a directional maritime traffic network which can effectively convert historical data into information supporting decision-making.","Traffic control,vessel experience route analysis,data mining,Clustering algorithms,Kernel,empirical support,historical data,unsupervised method,Feature extraction,historical AIS data-driven unsupervised automatic extraction,Directional Maritime Traffic Network,maritime traffic management,vessel traffic pattern extraction,information supporting decision-making,channel triangle network construction,multidimensional data,density distribution,automatic identification system,marine safety,marine engineering,Traffic Pattern,channel boundary extraction,pattern clustering,decision making,Artificial intelligence,vessel trajectories,Trajectory,Triangular Network,traffic engineering computing,directional maritime traffic network,Data mining,voyages,vessel experience routes,"
"the twenty-first century of structural engineering research: a topic modeling approach","2022","Aiming at disclosing a general research landscape of structural engineering in the twenty-first century, this study applies the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), a topic modeling approach, to analyze 51,346 article abstracts from 23 prestigious journals in structural engineering with a publication period from 2000 to 2020. The LDA analyzes the literature inventory by extracting 50 distinguishable wordclouds, each centered around one distinct research theme and assigned a unique topic name. Subsequently, various measures have been proposed to integrate the posterior distributions of these research topics with article information such as publication year, journal name, and correspondence address. The increase index identifies five cold and hot topics, which reflect the shift of research interests in the community. Emerging research topics such as seismic risk assessment and composite material have received much more attention in recent years. Moreover, advanced metrics have been proposed to analyze the research similarity and evolution across different journals and countries/regions. As discussed in the paper, analysis findings would enable community stakeholders (e.g., students, engineers, researchers, conference organizers, journal editors, funding agencies) to explore the state of the research and develop viable strategies to further foster the healthy growth of the community. Such strategies can be (1) researchers submitting a paper to the most appropriate journal; (2) journal editors adjusting the journal focus to enhance its impact; and (3) funding agencies prioritizing research supports that best fit regional needs and circumstances, among others.","Structural engineering research,Country/region topic distribution,Topic modeling,Latent Dirichlet allocation,Cold and hot topics,Journal topic distribution,"

"are shipwrecks a real hazard for the ecosystem in the mediterranean sea?","2017","The aim of the present study was to evaluate the hazard from shipwrecks on communities by a holistic approach taking into account different effects on biological communities. Multibeam and Remotely Operated Vehicles surveys recorded ecological assessment of fish and benthic species on three shipwrecks flooded during the Second World War on Maërl beds habitats in the strait of Sicily. Pollution levels of a wide range of chemicals of ecotoxicological concern were also measured in sediments and in fish species from different trophic levels. Statistical analysis evidenced significant differences among pollutant levels between both sediments and fish collected in shipwreck sites and controls. Concerning fish, significant effects due to the vessel's cargo type and flooding position are recorded. In spite of that, our results underline that shipwrecks are also a hotspots of biodiversity and a habitat for preservation strategies in marine ecosystems that need to be monitored.","trace elements,PAHs,Pollution,POPs,Lampedusa Island,beds habitats,"
"distribution of sulfur aerosol precursors in the spcz released by continuous volcanic degassing at ambrym, vanuatu","2016","The Melanesian Volcanic Arc (MVA) emits about 12kTd−1 of sulfur dioxide (SO2) to the atmosphere from continuous passive (non-explosive) volcanic degassing, which contributes 20% of the global SO2 emission from volcanoes. Here we assess, from up-to-date and long-term observations, the SO2 emission of the Ambrym volcano, one of the dominant volcanoes in the MVA, and we investigate its role as sulfate precursor on the regional distribution of aerosols, using both satellite observations and model results at 1°×1° spatial resolution from WRF-Chem/GOCART. Without considering aerosol forcing on clouds, our model parameterizations for convection, vertical mixing and cloud properties provide a reliable chemical weather representation, making possible a cross-examination of model solution and observations. This preliminary work enables the identification of biases and limitations affecting both the model (missing sources) and satellite sensors and algorithms (for aerosol detection and classification) and leads to the implementation of improved transport and aerosol processes in the modeling system. On the one hand, the model confirms a 50% underestimation of SO2 emissions due to satellite swath sampling of the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI), consistent with field studies. The OMI irregular sampling also produces a level of noise that impairs its monitoring capacity during short-term volcanic events. On the other hand, the model reveals a large sensitivity on aerosol composition and Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) due to choices of both the source function in WRF-Chem and size parameters for sea-salt in FlexAOD, the post-processor used to compute offline the simulated AOD. We then proceed to diagnosing the role of SO2 volcanic emission in the regional aerosol composition. The model shows that both dynamics and cloud properties associated with the South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ) have a large influence on the oxidation of SO2 and on the transport pathways of volcanic species across the South Pacific atmosphere. For example, in the tropical cloudy air, the sulfate production in the aqueous phase is very efficient, resulting in the formation of a large cloud of highly scattering sulfate aerosols advected horizontally to Eastern Indonesia, in agreement with the AOD feature captured by MODIS/Aqua, but missed in CALIOP/CALIPSO (lidar) products. Model sensitivity experiments indicate that aerosol re-suspension due to evaporating droplets is a significant pathway for the supply of volcanic sulfur species in the remote marine boundary layer. By strongly modulating the irreversible loss due to wet scavenging, this aerosol process has a similar influence on the sulfur burden as natural emission from volcanoes or biogenic sources like dimethyl sulfate (DMS). The results emphasize the importance of MVA passive degassing and SPCZ dynamics on the aerosol background, and raise questions about potential impacts on the local climate and marine ecosystems.","Volcanic plume impacts,Aerosol modeling,SO dispersal,SPCZ dynamics,Remote sensing,Regional aerosol climatology,"

The YOLOv5 detector and the OceanPlus tracker have been trained on a custom dataset with good performance in accuracy and processing time. The drone's position with respect to the vessel is estimated by applying stereo triangulation to the centres of the bounding boxes returned by the object detectors and trackers.

"shell disease in eastern oysters, crassostrea virginica, reared in france","2002","Progeny of eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica, introduced into France in 1992, were reared in IFREMER facilities to test their growth performances. During the summer of 1993, sporadic mass mortalities (80–90%) occurred among C. virginica spat reared in the IFREMER laboratories in La Tremblade (Charente Maritime, France) and Bouin (Vendée, France). Affected oysters presented mantle retraction and deposition of an anomalous conchiolin layer on the inner surface of the shell. The incidence of oysters with gross signs exceeded 80%. No obvious pathogen was identified in soft tissues by histology and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). However, histological examination showed the presence of anomalous basophilic round structures, 0.5–1 μm in diameter, in gill and mantle connective tissues. These extracellular Feulgen-negative structures reacted positively with the von Kossa stain. TEM examination on mantle and gill samples in diseased spat showed that the basophilic bodies consisted of concentric deposits of an amorphous substance interpreted as containing calcium. These observations may indicate that the mineralization process in spat shells was disturbed without exact determination of the cause. Based on the similarities of the gross signs to those reported in juvenile eastern oysters in the United States, we believe that the cause of the mortalities observed in France was probably the Juvenile Oyster Disease. Moreover, we report for the first time the detection of anomalous amorphous structures in gill and mantle connective tissues associated with mortalities and deposition of an anomalous conchioloin layer on the inner shell surface in C. virginica spat.",""
"a new approach to forecast solar irradiances using wrf and libradtran models, validated with merra-2 reanalysis data and pyranometer measures","2021","Solar energy is playing an increasingly important role in the production of electricity through photovoltaic and Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) systems. This type of energy requires an efficient storage system that will allow its use when the sunset or during cloudy weather. Hence, 0-48 hours forecast lead time is crucial for electrical network managers to anticipate energy deficits during periods of cloud occurrence. This study presents a new approach to forecast solar irradiances using a Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) model outputs, coupled with a Radiative Transfer operator, namely libRadtran. The NWP model used in this study is the WRF-Solar configuration of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF), designed for solar energy in order to forecast solar irradiances. The other parameters forecasted by WRF like the vertical profiles of cloud liquid water (CLW), cloud ice water (IWC), clouds fraction, relative humidity, and temperature will be used as input for libRadtran to compute off-line the solar irradiances. Both forecasted irradiances were first compared with the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications Version-2 (MERRA-2) data, then validated a second time by ground measurements for three locations in Algeria for the years 2016 and 2017. The results clearly show that the solar irradiances forecasted directly by WRF-Solar underestimate the MERRA-2 data for high solar zenith angles. With regard to the proposed approach, there is an improvement in the forecast of the solar irradiances during clear sky days and the rRMSE of the calculated Global Tilted Irradiance (GTI) reaches 12% in winter and increases to 22% in summer.","libRadtran,Forecasting,MERRA-2,Global irradiance,WRF,"
"gnss-based passive radar for maritime surveillance: long integration time mti technique","2017","The exploitation of the Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) as transmitters of opportunity in passive radar systems for maritime surveillance is particularly attractive because of the main advantages consisting in a global coverage (even in open sea) and in the availability of multiple sources (different satellites and constellations). The main drawback stays in the restricted power budget provided by navigation satellites. This makes necessary to conceive, define and develop innovative moving target detection techniques specifically tailored for the system under consideration, in order to make this technology a powerful tool for persistent surveillance of sea areas of interest.

"sar and ais fusion for maritime surveillance","2018","This paper presents a novel approach to fuse Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images and Automatic Identification System (AIS) data for maritime surveillance. The procedure consists of four steps. First, ship detection is performed in the SAR image using a Constant False Alarm Rate (CFAR) algorithm; then feature extraction (ship position, heading and size) is performed on ships detected in the SAR image, the third step consists in identifying the detected ships and extracting the same features from the AIS data. The final step is to feed the fusion block with both features vectors extracted separately from the SAR and AIS. Here the arithmetic mean function is established. The algorithm is tested using simulated SAR images and AIS data.

"surface ozone in the north american pollution outflow region of nova scotia: long-term analysis of surface concentrations, precursor emissions and long-range transport influence","2021","Nova Scotia is in the air pollution outflow region of North America and experiences elevated surface air pollution episodes regularly. We present the first analysis of long-term (2000–2018) hourly ozone (O3) and ozone precursor gas trends at three Nova Scotia provincial monitoring locations (‘urban’ Halifax, ‘suburban’ Halifax at Lake Major and ‘regional background’ at Aylesford Mountain), together with an examination of provincial ozone precursor emission trends. The precursors considered are nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOC). Over the common data period for the three stations (2006–2017) the annual 99th percentile hourly ozone concentrations decreased significantly in Halifax (−0.77 ppb/year; p = 0.02) and at Aylesford (−0.65 ppb/year; p = 0.03), in agreement with regional trends. No statistically significant changes were found in high ozone at suburban Lake Major (−0.02 ppb/year; p = 0.94), but the annual 25th percentile, median, and 75th percentile hourly ozone concentrations increased significantly (p < 0.01) only at this location (1.09 ppb/year, 1.23 ppb/year, 1.03 ppb/year, respectively). This is consistent with the strong NOx-O3 titration effect in downtown Halifax decreasing over time. After correcting for the titration effect over the full study period, the annual median Halifax total ozone is found to be decreasing (−0.45 ppb/year; p = 0.02). Over the full study period, ambient concentrations of precursors decreased significantly (p < 0.01) in Halifax by −2.34 ppb/year for NOx and −3.41 μg/m3/year for VOCs, as did the ozone formation potential (OFP) of VOCs (−9.66 μg/m3/year; p < 0.01). The underlying emissions of precursors also decreased significantly (p < 0.01) in and near Halifax (provincial NOx: 3982 ppb/year; provincial VOCs: 1680 tonnes/year), also in agreement with regional trends. However, a linear regression during 2012–2018 showed a decelerating reduction of provincial NOx emissions. Provincial total VOC emissions also decreased approximately ten times slower during 2012–2018, albeit this was not statistically significant. Finally, we present an algorithm to identify events of long-range transported pollution in Halifax, based on spatial correlations in ozone across surface monitoring stations in Nova Scotia. Between 2000 and 2018, transported upstream pollution was found to be connected to between 45% and 63% of 1444 days when surface ozone was elevated in Halifax. The frequency with which transported pollution events occur increased by 15% across this time period.","Precursor emissions,Ozone,Transport,Trends,Transboundary,Nova scotia,"
"maritime search and rescue networking based on multi-agent cooperative communication","2019","Rapid and effective maritime search and rescue operations become the important guarantee for the safety of maritime navigation. The existing maritime search and rescue networking and model have slow response speed and low efficiency.

"“ship-port-country” multi-dimensional research on the fine analysis of china's lng trade","2023","Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) is a clean and low-carbon energy source that plays an important role in combating global warming. As the world's largest greenhouse gas (GHG) emitter, China has taken coal-to-gas as an important measure to reduce GHG emissions, and has become the world's largest LNG importer. Studying the patterns and characteristics of China's LNG trade is of great significance for ensuring energy supply security, formulating and adjusting energy strategies. However, the refined analysis of China's LNG trade is still inadequate, mainly due to the lack of research on the details of ship trajectories and port attributes. Therefore, a “ship-port-country” multidimensional LNG trade analysis method is proposed to improve the timeliness, multi-dimensionality and fineness of China's LNG trade analysis. The multidimensional characteristics of China's LNG trade are analyzed by studying the big data of nearly 3.5 billion automatic identification system (AIS) records in 2017. The study has found that (1) The arrival frequency of China's LNG trading ships varies greatly with time. For example, the most frequent daily arrivals are between 04:00 and 05:00 in the morning, while the least frequent arrivals are between 15:00 and 17:00 in the afternoon. (2) The Chinese LNG trade network consisting of 79 ports has been formed, of which NANTONG Port is the most important port. (3) The LNG trade volume calculated in this study has shown a strong correlation with the national LNG trade statistics and can be used to analyze LNG trade with higher spatial and temporal resolution. According to the characteristics of LNG trade at the three levels of ship, port and country, China can optimize its LNG trade policy from the following aspects: (1) Dynamically allocate port resources according to the arrival frequency of LNG tankers to reduce port congestion and waste of resources. (2) Expand core LNG trading ports such as NANTONG Port, ZHOUSHAN Port, TANGSHAN (JINGTANG) Port, XIUYU Port, DALIAN Port and LUSHUN Port. (3) Actively realize the diversification of LNG trading partners to reduce the dependence of LNG import sources on one country or region, and ensure energy security. The “ship-port-country” multi-level LNG trade analysis method proposed in this study provides a new research perspective for the analysis of the LNG trade pattern. This study reveals the multidimensional characteristics of China's LNG trade, which can provide decision-making support for China to formulate reasonable LNG trade policies and energy security policies, and is conducive to the stable and sustainable development of global LNG trade.","Multidimensional analysis,Ship trajectory data,China's LNG trade,LNG trade,Fine-grained trade characteristics,"

To further improve the network performance, we formulate an energy efficiency (EE) maximization resource allocation problem and solve it by an iterative algorithm based on the Dinkelbach method.

"influence of atmospheric circulation and local parameters on activity concentration of gross alpha and gross beta in granada, spain","2023","This work analyses the influence of local meteorology and air mass origin on radioactivity levels measured in Granada (Southern Spain). To the scope, gross α and gross β activities at ground-level air were weekly recorded from 2006 to 2021, by collecting aerosol filters and successively analysing them by low-level proportional counting. Time series decomposition shows a strong correlation between the seasonal components of gross α and gross β and the local meteorological parameters, in particular temperature and wind speed. Back trajectories reaching the study area during the sampling, calculated at three height levels (750 m, 1500 m, and 3000 m a.s.l.), were analysed by three methods with the aim to determine the main characteristics of air masses reaching Granada, and their impact on airborne radioactivity levels. The results of the residence time and clustering analyses showed that an increase in the radioactivity levels in the southeast of Spain is connected with air masses coming from the Mediterranean at 750 m and from the South (Sahara Desert) at 3000 m. In line with the outcomes obtained by the cluster analysis, the Concentration Weighted Trajectory (WCWT) results highlight that the air masses transported from Mediterranean and African regions are a potential source of gross α and gross β. Moreover, the findings of the WCWT bring a new aspect by revealing that the southern France region can also have a significant contribution to gross alpha and beta activities.","Gross alpha,Radioactivity,Back-trajectories,Gross beta,Air masses,"
"robust infrared maritime target detection via anti-jitter spatialâ€“temporal trajectory consistency","2022","When detecting diverse infrared (IR) small maritime targets on complicated scenes, the existing methods get into trouble and unsatisfactory performance. The main reasons are as follows: 1) affected by target characteristics and ambient temperature and so on, both bright and dark targets may exist on IR maritime images in practical application and 2) spatial information and temporal correlation of targets are not fully excavated. To these problems, we propose a robust anti-jitter spatialâ€“temporal trajectory consistency (ASTTC) method, the main idea of which is to improve detection accuracy using single-frame detection followed by multi-frame decision. First, we innovatively design adaptive local gradient variation (ALGV) descriptor, which combines local dissimilarity measure with gradient magnitude distribution to enhance the local contrast for both bright and dark targets so that the suspected targets can be robustly extracted. For multi-frame decision, interframe displacement correction is necessary to eliminate the interference of IR imager motion and vibration for target codeword. We use pyramid optical flow to track feature point extracted by Shi-Tomasi to capture interframe registration coefficients. Then, the target position is corrected in the spatialâ€“temporal domain. Finally, a robust spatialâ€“temporal trajectory descriptor (STTD), which achieves target encoding and target trajectory consistency measurement, is designed to further confirm real targets and eliminate false targets. Experiments conducted on various real IR maritime image sequences demonstrate the applicability and robustness of ASTTC, which performs more satisfactorily than the existing methods in detection accuracy.","target characteristics,Pipelines,Optical imaging,ALGV descriptor,temporal correlation,robust spatial-temporal trajectory descriptor,image motion analysis,Feature extraction,gradient magnitude distribution,small-target detection,STTD,anti-jitter spatialâ€“temporal trajectory consistency (ASTTC),Adaptive local gradient variation (ALGV),Shi-Tomasi,robust infrared maritime target detection,multiframe decision,single-frame detection,robust anti-jitter spatial-temporal trajectory consistency,Target tracking,object detection,feature extraction,target encoding,IR imager motion,local dissimilarity measure,IR maritime image sequences,interframe registration capture,image registration,correlation methods,gradient methods,ASTTC,infrared imaging,Trajectory,image sequences,target trajectory consistency measurement,spatial information,Object detection,Adaptive optics,image capture,adaptive local gradient variation descriptor,"

This is done by the pre-extraction of contextual information as the baseline patterns of life (i.e., routes) in the area under investigation. In addition to a brief description of the approach to derive the routes, their characterization and representation is presented in support of exploitable knowledge to classify anomalies. A hierarchical reasoning is proposed where new tracks are first associated to existing routes based on their positional information only and â€œoff-routeâ€ vesselsâ€ are detected. Then, for on-route vessels further anomalies are detected such as â€œspeed anomalyâ€ or â€œheading anomalyâ€.

AOD over the Indian Ocean region is observed to be significantly influenced by the transport of aerosols from Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia and Arabia. AOD as well as its latitude gradient in the Northern Hemisphere generally increase from November to April. High aerosol loading observed over the Indian Ocean during February–April period of 1999 is closely associated with the changes in atmospheric circulation features and transport from the Asian continent.","Aerosol transport,Indian Ocean experiment,ElNino,Optical depth,Satellite remote sensing,"

Our algorithms take real-time tracking information and learn motion pattern models on-the-fly, enabling the models to adapt well to evolving situations while maintaining high levels of performance. The constantly refined models, resulting from concurrent incremental learning, are used to evaluate the behavior patterns of vessels based on their present motion states. At the event level, learning provides the capability to detect (and alert) upon anomalous behavior. At a higher (inter-event) level, learning enables predictions, over pre-defined time horizons, to be made about future vessel location. Predictions can also be used to alert on anomalous behavior. Learning is context-specific and occurs at multiple levels: for example, for individual vessels as well as classes of vessels.

"sources of the seasonal-trend behaviour and periodicity modulation of 7be air concentration in the atmospheric surface layer observed in southeastern spain","2019","The components and the periodicity characterising airborne 7Be monthly concentration collected in Granada (SE Spain) between 2000 and 2018 are studied. These 19 years of measurements are particularly significant for the 7Be analysis as they cover the complete 24th solar cycle, 2008–2018. A Time Series Decomposition (TSD) technique has been applied to determine the different components present in the dataset: the trend, seasonal and irregular components. Then, the atmospheric parameters (Precipitation (Pp), Relative Humidity (RH), Temperature (Temp), Wind speed (WS), Total Cloudiness (TC), Low Cloudiness (LC)), teleconnection indices and the solar activity (Sun Spot Number, SSN) were used to justify the variability of each component. SSN and the teleconnection indices (Western Mediterranean Oscillation (WeMO), Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) and Quasi Biennial Oscillation (QBO)) are found to have a major impact on the trend component of 7Be. In turn, all the atmospheric parameters were found to have strong impact on the seasonal component. In order to observe the change in the impact of the parameters from the 24th solar cycle (from 2008 to 2018) to the complete time series (starting in 2000), the comparison between the two periods has been carried out. The results show that, over the 24th solar cycle, the SSN impacted predominantly on the trend component, whereas atmospheric parameters showed a slightly higher impact on the seasonal component. In addition, some atmospheric factors (Temp, RH, Pp, TC, LC) appeared to partially affect the irregular component. The analysis of the two phases of the 24th solar cycle shows that the influence of SSN is higher during the descending phase than during the ascending one. This behaviour is opposed to the one found for the 23rd solar cycle, which clarifies the special characteristics of the 24th cycle. Besides that, the Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) analysis was applied in order to extract the possible periodicities characterising 7Be data. The analysis revealed three sets of periodicities. Then, the Wavelet Coherence Analysis (WCA) method was particularly useful to study coherences between 7Be data and teleconnection indices. The 7Be concentrations in the large period (11–14 years) detected by CWT was found to be mainly modulated by WeMO, AMO and QBO, while the NAO modulates the smaller periods.","Wavelet analysis,Teleconnections indices,Time series decomposition,Atmospheric aerosols,Be,"
"a preliminary model for maritime accident analysis by using functional resonance analysis method (fram)","2021","With the melting of sea ice, the Arctic region attracts a large number of tourists due to its unique geographical location and abundant tourism resources. The ship tourism business scale in the Arctic region continues to expand. However, there are more ship incidents/accidents in Arctic waters with the increase of ship activities. There is a requirement to make the safety management of passenger ships in Arctic operations. This paper focuses on the accident scenario analysis in Arctic shipping. The functional resonance analysis method (FRAM) systematically analyzes ship scenario accidents in Arctic waters by transforming accident-related events into interrelated functional modules and studying the mechanism of accidents from the perspective of functional characteristics. The â€œClipper Adventurerâ€ ship grounding accident is chosen as a case to explore system functions, variability, and complex interactions in Arctic shipping.","FRAM,marine accidents,Arctic waters,accident-related events,functional characteristics,Transportation,ship tourism business scale,travel industry,Marine vehicles,Arctic operations,Clipper Adventurer ship grounding accident,maritime accident analysis,system functions,Arctic shipping,interrelated functional modules,abundant tourism resources,Clipper Adventurer,Ferroelectric films,sea ice,ships,marine safety,functional resonance analysis method,accident scenario analysis,ship activities,Nonvolatile memory,unique geographical location,Water,risk analysis,Arctic,preliminary model,maritime accident,passenger ships,Random access memory,accidents,Arctic region,"
"a neural network-based approach for the detection of heavy precipitation using gnss observations and surface meteorological data","2021","Recent years have witnessed a growing interest in using GNSS observations to detect heavy precipitation. In this study, a neural network-based (NN-based) approach taking seven meteorological variables as input data was developed based on the back propagation (BP) algorithm for detecting heavy precipitation. Apart from the surface meteorological variables of temperature, pressure and relative humidity, the model has also adopted other information such as day-of-year, hour-of-day and GNSS-derived zenith total delay and precipitable water vapor (PWV) as input variables. The feasibility of using these variables for developing the BP-NN-based model was elaborated by conducting the feature analysis of the seven input variables. In addition, the criterion for selecting a proper size of training sample was also briefly investigated by studying the impact and sensibility of the sample lengths in the model. The proposed model was developed using a sample size of an 8-year (2010–2017) period in the summer at a pair of co-located GNSS/weather stations−HKSC-KP in Hong Kong. The use of a long-term data is to “reliably” capture the characteristics of the selected variables. The detection results for the summer months in 2018 and 2019 were then compared against corresponding precipitation records to valid the effectiveness of the newly proposed model. Results of the correct detection and false alarm rates were 94.5 % and 20.8 %, respectively, which were significant improvements compared with the existing models.","Neural network,Zenith total delay (ZTD),Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS),Precipitable water vapor (PWV),Heavy precipitation detection,"
"advances in ne-atlantic coastal sea level change monitoring by delay doppler altimetry","2021","A significant part of the World population lives in the coastal zone, which is affected by sea level rise and extreme events. Consistent and precise new measurements are needed to assess and predict these changes. New altimeter missions equipped with Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) mode provide more accurate sea level heights. In this work we analyse their impacts on the estimation of the coastal sea level variability in the last 10 km. First, by analysing various standard and improved SAR altimetric products it is found that SAR altimetry will reduce the minimum usable distance from five to three kilometres. The best performance is achieved with the SAR coastal retrackers SAMOSA+ and SAMOSA++. A comparable performance is obtained in low resolution Reduced SAR (RDSAR) mode with the Spatio-Temporal Altimeter sub-waveform Retracker (STAR). In both cases, sea level heights are recovered with 4 cm accuracy up to 3 km from the coast at the Helgoland station, and the accuracy does not decrease with the distance to coast. In estuaries and coastal zones with hight tidal regimes, the discrepancy between altimetry and in-situ observations remains large (40 cm standard deviation difference (stdd) with SAR-SAM+). CryoSat-2 and Sentinel-3A have similar accuracy, despite their different repeat cycle and sampling, which require a different post-processing. The monthly coastal variability from the SAR-SAM+ product agrees most favourably with the NEMO-WAM model, with stdd 3.9 and correlation 0.90 for Sentinel-3A. Instead, the maximum departure between altimeter data products is between SAR-SAM+ and RDSAR-TALES CryoSat-2 data (stdd 2.3 and correlation 0.96). An average trend of about 3 ± 1.3 mm/yr has been detected using low resolution altimetry at ninetheen in-situ stations along the German coast over time intervals longer than 15 years. The difference of the trends of altimetry and tide gauge co-located time-series (al-tg) agrees with the GNSS rates within 1.5 mm/yr at half of the co-located locations, with error of al-tg larger than the error of the GPS rate by a factor bigger than two. The larger departure between monthly tide gauge and LRM altimetric time-series as between tide gauge and SAR altimetric time-series confirms the higher accuracy of SAR data compared to LRM. Finally, the sea level trends of the merged LRM and SAR altimetry time-series are consistent with the LRM trends.","Sea level change,Tide gauge,Delay-Doppler Altimetry,"
"footprints of fishing vessels in chinese waters based on automatic identification system data","2022","The importance and difficulty of large-scale quantitative analysis of fishing vessel footprints and fishing intensities with high resolution have received more and more attention and recognition in fishery research. In this study, a framework for identifying and analyzing fishing footprints and activities based on AIS data is proposed. The first step is the AIS data pre-processing. Through the screening and cleaning of AIS data, noise data such as non-fishing vessel trajectories are removed to retain only fishing vessel trajectories. The second step is the behavior detection of fishing vessels. Based on the proposed speed identification method, the trajectory of a fishing vessel is divided into three states: Fishing, stationary, and sailing. The third step is the calculation of fishing vessel activities. An adjacent point mean method is proposed to calculate the fishing time of each fishing point. In addition, two simple and efficient quantitative indicators, namely unit cell activity frequency (UCAF) and unit cell fishing time (UCFT), are proposed to quantify the activities of fishing vessels. The last step is the spatial and temporal analysis of fishing activities. The global Moran's index and Getis-Ord Gi* index are used to quantitatively describe the global spatio-temporal distribution and local spatio-temporal hotspots of fishing activities. Based on >130 million AIS data from 2015 to 2016, the footprints of fishing vessels in the waters of China's exclusive economic zone (EEZ) were analyzed and the 0.01° × 0.01° high-resolution fishing vessel activity distribution maps and fishing time distribution maps were generated. It is found that the footprints of fishing vessels in China's EEZ waters have a positive spatial correlation, and the areas with high fishing intensities are clustered in the coastal waters of Shandong Province, Zhejiang Province, Fujian Province and Guangdong Province. The research results can be used for fishing area identification, fishery policy making, and sustainable fisheries development.","Quantitative analysis,Spatio-temporal analysis,Fisheries management,Chinese fishery,Fishing activity,Trajectory analysis,"
"robust data association for multi-object detection in maritime environments using camera and radar measurements","2021","This letter presents a robust data association method for fusing camera and marine radar measurements in order to automatically detect surface ships and determine their locations with respect to the observing ship. In the preprocessing step for sensor fusion, convolutional neural networks are used to perform feature extraction from camera images and semantic segmentation from radar images.

"extraction of fault component from abnormal sound in diesel engines using acoustic signals","2016","In this paper a method for extracting fault components from abnormal acoustic signals and automatically diagnosing diesel engine faults is presented. The method named dislocation superimposed method (DSM) is based on the improved random decrement technique (IRDT), differential function (DF) and correlation analysis (CA). The aim of DSM is to linearly superpose multiple segments of abnormal acoustic signals because of the waveform similarity of faulty components. The method uses sample points at the beginning of time when abnormal sound appears as the starting position for each segment. In this study, the abnormal sound belonged to shocking faulty type; thus, the starting position searching method based on gradient variance was adopted. The coefficient of similar degree between two same sized signals is presented. By comparing with a similar degree, the extracted fault component could be judged automatically. The results show that this method is capable of accurately extracting the fault component from abnormal acoustic signals induced by faulty shocking type and the extracted component can be used to identify the fault type.","Cross correlation,Auto-correlation,Dislocation superimposed method,Random decrement technique,Engine fault,"

"hot moments and hotspots of cyanobacteria hyperblooms in the curonian lagoon (se baltic sea) revealed via remote sensing-based retrospective analysis","2021","A temporally and spatially detailed historical (1985–2018) analysis of cyanobacteria blooms was performed in the Curonian Lagoon (Lithuania, Russia), the largest coastal lagoon in the Baltic Sea. Satellite data allowed the mapping of cyanobacteria surface accumulations, so-called “scums”, and of chlorophyll-a concentration. The 34-year time series shows a tendency towards later occurrence (October–November) of the cyanobacteria scum presence, whereas the period of its onset (June–July) remains relatively constant. The periods when scums are present, “hot moments”, have been consistently increasing in duration since 2008. The differences in the starting, ending and annual duration of cyanobacteria blooms have been significantly altered by hydro-meteorological conditions (river discharge, water temperature, and wind conditions) and their year-round patterns. The most important environmental factors that determined the temporal changes of the scum presence and area were the standing stock of cyanobacteria and the ambient wind conditions. The “hotspots”, the areas where the blooms most likely occur, were distributed in the south-southwestern and central parts of the lagoon. The least affected areas were the northern part, which is connected to the coastal waters of the Baltic Sea, and the Nemunas River delta region. The longstanding, well-established spatial patterns of cyanobacteria blooms were linked to hydrodynamic features, namely water renewal time and current patterns, and to potential nutrient sources that included muddy sediments and the locations of colonies of piscivorous birds. Our findings confirmed that the annual and seasonal variations of cyanobacteria blooms and their regulation are a complex issue due to interactions between multiple factors over spatially and temporally broad scales. Despite great progress in the prevention and control of eutrophication and cyanobacteria blooms, the lagoon is still considered to be in a poor ecological status. This work provides a new and missing understanding on the spatial and temporal extent of cyanobacteria blooms and the factors that govern them. Such an understanding can help in planning management strategies, forecasting the magnitude and severity of blooms under changing nutrient loads and potential climate scenarios.","Curonian Lagoon,Remote sensing,Eutrophication,Cyanobacteria scum,Drivers of hyperblooms,"
"advance learning technique for the electricity market attack detection","2022","The false data injection (FDI) attacks in the AC smart microgrid (SMG) and the solution for detecting attacks on distributed energy sources in the SMG are discussed in the present paper. As the input indices for the deep machine learning (DML) algorithm, wavelet singular amounts are used as an alternative method of detecting FDI attacks (FDIAs). By means of the suggested approach, a specified error is used to adjust the precision factors of the wavelet transform and subsequently, singular value decomposition is used to retrieve features from wavelet coefficients. The wavelet singular values in switching surfaces of current and voltage are used to determine the indexes used for DML and diagnosing FDIA. Detecting FDIA with great precision is the main goal of the suggested detection plan. A simulation study using MATLAB/Simulink is conducted on SMG to demonstrate the performance of the suggested approach.","False data injection,Wavelet transform,Deep learning,Market price,Smart microgrid,"
"upper air thermal inversion and their impact on the summer monsoon rainfall over goa – a case study","2018","Profiles of periodic GPS Radiosonde ascends collected from a station at the west coast of India (Goa) during summer monsoon months (June to September) of 2009 and 2013 have been used to analyze the thermal inversion statistics at various heights and their repercussions on the regional weather is studied. The interaction of contrasting air masses over the northern Arabian Sea often produces a two layer structure in the lower 5000 m close to the coastal station with warm and dusty air (Summer Shamal) occupying the space above the cool and moist Low Level Jet (LLJ) by virtue of their density differences. The warm air intrusion creates low lapse rate pockets above LLJ and modifies the gravitational stability strong enough to inhibit convection. It is observed that the inversion occurring in the lower 3000 m layer with an optimum layer thickness of 100–200 m has profound influence on the weather beneath it. We demonstrated the validity of the proposed hypothesis by analyzing the collocated data from radiosonde, lidar and the rain gauge during 16th July 2013 as a case study. The lidar depolarization ratio provides evidence to support the two layer structure in the lidar backscatter image. The presence of dust noticed in the two layer interface hints the intrusion of warm air that makes the atmosphere stable enough to suppress convection. The daily rainfall record of 2013 surprisingly coincides with the patterns of a regional break like situation centered at 16th July 2013 in Goa.","Low Level Jet,Two layer structure,Warm air intrusion,Thermal inversion,Monsoon,"
"maritime smuggling detection and mitigation using risk-aware hybrid robotic sensor networks","2017","With the rise of more resourceful unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), their inclusion into robotic sensor networks (RSNs) is inevitable. The highly mobile nature of UAVs allows greater monitoring capabilities, making them most suitable for RSNs. Compared to traditional nodes in RSNs, UAVs suffer even more from communication disruptions and energy depletion, must often rapidly determine actions for themselves, and consequently require more autonomy. Prior work has been done in wireless sensor network (WSN)/aerial sensor network (ASN) coordination in a few applications such as protecting critical infrastructure, restoring communication between nodes, and healing networks, while other work has been accomplished on using the UAV network for augmenting the monitoring capabilities of WSNs. We introduce a novel methodology to integrate UAVs into RSNs for monitoring purposes by formulating the problem in the context of a risk management framework (RMF). This methodology allows a more precise risk feature classification and a more efficient task allocation for the ground network by utilizing the monitoring capabilities of the UAVs to informatively warn the RSN of any incoming events. We also present a fictitious but credible maritime smuggling scenario near the Port of Barcelona based on expert knowledge, and apply the methodology to detect and mitigate maritime smuggling. The network's behaviour is traced throughout the scenario and is repeated with civilian ships to assure that they are not flagged as smugglers.

"on the interest of data mining for an integrity assessment of ais messages","2016","Put in place by the International Maritime Organization, the Automatic Identification System is a worldwide maritime electronic system that sends radio broadcasted messages at a high rate between the stations, either on board the vessels or on shores.

"the small world of global marine crude oil trade based on crude oil tanker flows","2022","Global marine crude oil trade is a direct reflection of global economic trends. This study uses the real-world historical ship automatic identification system (AIS) data from 2014 to 2017 to explore the flows of crude oil tanker trade between ports and construct a port-node global crude oil trade model. An analysis framework of “AIS data -> crude oil tanker trade flows -> port-node crude oil trade network -> port-node crude oil trade backbone network” is proposed to realize the progressive analysis of global marine crude oil trade. The global port-node crude oil trade network is a small world, in which there are multiple small world port-node trade communities. Compared with the community structure of the global port-node crude oil trade in previous years, the Middle East–Southern Africa–South Asia–Oceania–Asia Pacific community and the Southern Africa–China community have more activities in port nodes and trade links in 2017, which reflects that the Asia-Pacific region, especially East Asian countries, is making efforts to expand the Oceania and African markets and increase the diversity of crude oil import sources to ensure the security of crude oil supply and demand.","Complex network,Small world,Trade community,Crude oil trade,"

"the geochemistry of gem opals as evidence of their origin","2008","Seventy-seven gem opals from ten countries were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) through a dilution process, in order to establish the nature of the impurities. The results are correlated to the mode of formation and physical properties and are instrumental in establishing the geographical origin of a gem opal. The geochemistry of an opal is shown to be dependant mostly on the host rock, at least for examples from Mexico and Brazil, even if modified by weathering processes. In order of decreasing concentration, the main impurities present are Al, Ca, Fe, K, Na, and Mg (more than 500 ppm). Other noticeable elements in lesser amounts are Ba, followed by Zr, Sr, Rb, U, and Pb. For the first time, geochemistry helps to discriminate some varieties of opals. The Ba content, as well as the chondrite-normalized REE pattern, are the keys to separating sedimentary opals (Ba>110 ppm, Eu and Ce anomalies) from volcanic opals (Ba<110 ppm, no Eu or Ce anomaly). The Ca content, and to a lesser extent that of Mg, Al, K and Nb, helps to distinguish gem opals from different volcanic environments. The limited range of concentrations for all elements in precious (play-of-color) compared to common opals, indicates that this variety must have very specific, or more restricted, conditions of formation. We tentatively interpreted the presence of impurities in terms of crystallochemistry, even if opal is a poorly crystallized or amorphous material. The main replacement is the substitution of Si4+ by Al3+ and Fe3+. The induced charge imbalance is compensated chiefly by Ca2+, Mg2+, Mn2+, Ba2+, K+, and Na+. In terms of origin of color, greater concentrations of iron induce darker colors (from yellow to “chocolate brown”). This element inhibits luminescence for concentrations above 1000 ppm, whereas already a low content in U (≤1 ppm) induces a green luminescence.","Opal,Trace element analysis,Chemical composition,Genesis,ICP-MS,"
"detection of signals linked to climate change, land-cover change and climate oscillators in tropical montane cloud forests","2021","Tropical Montane Cloud Forests (TMCFs) form biodiverse communities that are characterized by frequent occurrence of low-level clouds from which they capture a substantial proportion of their precipitation — here referred to as occult precipitation. TMCFs provide important ecosystem services, in particular the supply of water to their wider surroundings. Throughout the tropics (here 23.5∘ S to 23.5∘ N), they are under pressure from deforestation and poor land management which leads to loss of both forest area and species diversity, and reduces their capture of occult precipitation. Climate change may also reduce occult precipitation in TMCFs since the cloud base may lift in response to higher temperatures — the ‘lifting cloud-base hypothesis’. These threats to TMCFs are well understood, but their quantitative assessment is hampered by 1) uncertainty in the location and spatial extent of TMCFs and 2) limited availability of representative meteorological data. We use a Random Forest Classifier — informed by topographic data, MODIS vegetation data, TRMM precipitation data and ERA5-Land and MERRA-2 reanalysis products — to estimate the spatial distribution and extent of TMCFs (2.1 × 106 km2 ± 0.5 × 106 km2). We analyze temporal changes in climate, tree-cover and greenness of TMCFs over the past two to four decades to detect 1) multi-decadal trends, and 2) associations with the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD). Evidence for the ‘lifting cloud-base hypothesis’ in reanalysis products was inconsistent across the tropics; a lifting of the cloud base during the past four decades occurred for about 20% of TMCFs, predominantly in the Americas and a few locations in Africa, while in Asia a downward movement of the cloud base was found. However, these results in part depend on the bias correction applied to the reanalyses. Changes in TMCF tree cover and greenness varied by continent; in Africa in 50% of TMCFs tree cover declined, whereas TMCFs in the Americas and in Asia exhibited a net increase in tree cover, despite a reduction in tree cover in ~20% of these TMCFs. An important limitation of the tree-cover data is that they do not distinguish between natural tree cover and agro-forestry. ENSO signals were more strongly present in precipitation in American and Asian TMCFs, whereas IOD signals were stronger in TMCF temperature and dewpoint temperature across the tropics. ENSO and IOD signals were approximately equally important for precipitation in African TMCFs and in cloud-base height across the tropics. An arbitrary warming of 1 ∘C and a 100 m lifting of the cloud base, in accordance with the ‘lifting cloud hypothesis’, imposed on the Random Forest classifier showed a decline in the extent of TMCFs in the Americas and Africa, but an increase in Asia — mostly at the expense of evergreen broadleaf forests. The greater vulnerability of TMCFs in Africa may be linked to their more isolated and scattered distribution across the continent and drier conditions compared to a more continuous distribution and wetter conditions in the Americas and Asia.","IOD,ENSO,TRMM,Tropical Montane Cloud Forests,Reanalysis,MODIS,Climate change,Cloud-base height,"
"use of the automatic identification system (ais) for maritime domain awareness (mda)","2005","The Automatic Identification System (AIS) was developed primarily as a tool for maritime safety - vessel collision avoidance, use by Vessel Traffic Services (VTS) and as a means for littoral states to get information on vessels operating near their coasts. AIS equipment aboard vessels continuously and autonomously transmits information about the vessel including its identity, position, course and speed to enhance safety. This information has also come to be seen by the U. S. Coast Guard as a critical tool in enhancing Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) in support of all Coast Guard missions. MDA is the effective understanding of anything associated with the global maritime environment that could affect the security, safety, economy, or environment of the United States. To achieve MDA, the Coast Guard must collect as much information as possible on activities occurring in the maritime domain. A large part of this activity relates to the movement of vessels, therefore detection, classification, identification and monitoring of vessels is a key component of MDA.

In centralized fusion, the clients simply forward all of the data to a central location, and some entity at the central location is responsible for correlating and fusing the data. In this research we intend to correlate multiple maritime sensors such as RADAR, AIS, and other electronic object detection systems. Sri Lanka Navy has myriad of surveillance information sources such as AIS (Automatic Identification System), RADAR (Radio Aid Detection and Ranging), SONAR (Sound Navigation and Ranging), MSTT, HFSWR, AVL (Automatic Vessel Locating), HF Communication, Intelligence Data ect. So it is obvious that an information fusion methodology is needed to harness the effectiveness of multiple sensor information. An object identification pipeline is conceptualized such that an unknown object in the maritime domain is detected reducing the uncertainty of obtained information. The radical new virtual reality application has been developed to visualize the information fused from sensors and discussed in depth in addition to the introduction of the fusion process. The technologies used in developing the virtual world and incorporating the real time information in to the virtual world is presented in simplified modal for the purpose of clarity. Also design aspects and some experimental analysis developed in an applied project at the Sri Lanka Navy intended to demonstrate fusion technologies in this environment through an operative prototype are presented.","object identification pipeline,sensor fusion,virtual reality,virtual reality application,maritime sensor,operative prototype,Solid modeling,data visualisation,Mobile communication,sensor information fusion architecture,centralized data fusion,object detection,Networked information processing,Radar tracking,fused information visualization,virtual maritime surveillance system,Computational modeling,central location,Tactical display,video surveillance,virtual world,Information fusion,oceanographic techniques,"
"a lightweight authentication scheme for 6g-iot enabled maritime transport system","2023","The Sixth-Generation (6G) mobile network has the potential to provide not only traditional communication services but also additional processing, caching, sensing, and control capabilities to a massive number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Meanwhile, a 6G mobile network may provide global coverage and diverse quality-of-service provisioning to the Maritime Transportation System (MTS) when enabled through satellite systems. Although modern MTS has gained significant benefits from Internet of Things (IoT) and 6G technologies, threats and challenges in terms of security and privacy have also been grown substantially. Tracking the location of vessels, GPS spoofing, unauthorized access to data, and message tampering are some of the potential security and privacy vulnerabilities in the 6G-IoT enabled MTS. In this article, we propose a lightweight authentication protocol for a 6G-IoT enabled maritime transportation system to efficiently assist and ensure the security and privacy of maritime transportation systems. To validate the security characteristics, formal security assessment methods are utilized, i.e., Real-Or-Random (ROR) oracle model. The findings of the security analysis show that the proposed scheme is more secure than the existing schemes.","Satellites,IoT access,lightweight authentication scheme,computer network security,Transportation,Device access control,Sixth-Generation mobile network,6G-IoT enabled Maritime transport System,Internet of Things,satellite systems,Authentication,potential security,forged message,Global Positioning System,Things devices,blockchains,6G mobile network,6G mobile communication,device impersonation,diverse quality-of-service provisioning,Drones,traditional communication services,message authentication,lightweight authentication protocol,privacy vulnerabilities,cryptographic protocols,Security,authorisation,data privacy,maritime transportation system,"
"a network of hf surface wave radars for maritime surveillance: preliminary results in the german bight","2014","In the context of maritime surveillance, low-power HF surface-wave (HFSW) radars have demonstrated to be a cost-effective long-range early-warning sensor for ship detection and tracking. In this work, multi-target tracking and data fusion techniques are applied to live-recorded data from a network of oceanographic HFSW radars installed in the German Bight (North Sea). This experimentation closely follows the one conducted in the Ligurian Sea (Mediterranean Sea) by NATO Science and Technology Organization (STO) Centre for Maritime Research and Experimentation (CMRE) during the Battlespace Preparation 2009 (BP09) campaign. Ship reports from the Automatic Identification System (AIS), recorded from both coastal and satellite-based stations, are exploited as ground truth information and a methodology is applied to classify the fused tracks and to estimate system performances.

"location estimation in a maritime environment using a monocular camera","2014","Maritime surveillance is a very important task in coastal areas, especially in harbour environments. The most popular such systems include components like Automatic Identification System (AIS) and Radar. Camera based visual surveillance can be used as an alternative to these systems in order to overcome the lacking features of them. Sea surface object detection and identification is a major need for such visual surveillance systems. Most of the current visual surveillance systems don't have the ability of identifying vessels in real time. A vessel can be identified using information from other systems, if the location of the vessel is identified. Location estimation of sea surface objects is mainly explored in this research. Video stream from a single geo stationary camera is used as the input; however camera properties are not used for any calculation. Mainly two distance measurements are considered and different approaches for estimating the distances are explored. Neural network approach gave considerably accurate results in vertical distance estimation and it was found that the shortest distance from camera to the object can be measured best using B-spline 3D curve fitting. Data taken from AIS is used for fitting curves and training neural network. After calculating distances, latitudes and longitudes are calculated. An evaluation has been done comparing the calculated values and the values obtained from AIS data using various statistical tests. There, the different approaches are compared and accuracy levels are described. Vessel identification is done comparing the estimated location and the available location information from AIS data.","sea surface object detection,vessel identification,distance measurement,marine navigation,Global Positioning System,statistical test,splines (mathematics),geostationary camera,Maritime,video stream,Distance Estimation,neural nets,monocular camera,ships,maritime surveillance,B-spline 3D curve fitting,object detection,location estimation,sea surface object identification,vertical distance estimation,curve fitting,maritime environment,neural network approach,video surveillance,Monocular Vision,Location Estimation,camera based visual surveillance,"
"maritime anomaly detection using gaussian process active learning","2012","A model of normal vessel behaviours is useful for detecting illegal, suspicious, or unsafe behaviour; such as vessel theft, drugs smuggling, people trafficking or poor sailing. This work presents a data-driven non-parametric Bayesian model, based on Gaussian Processes, to model normal shipping behaviour. This model is learned from Automatic Identification System (AIS) data and uses an Active Learning paradigm to select an informative subsample of the data to reduce the computational complexity of training. The resultant model allows a measure of normality to be calculated for each newly-observed transmission according to its velocity given its current latitude and longitude. Using this measure of normality, ships can be identified as potentially anomalous and prioritised for further investigation. The model performance is assessed by its ability to detect artificially generated AIS anomalies at locations around the United Kingdom. Finally, the model is demonstrated on case studies from artificial and real vessel data to detect anomalies in unusual tracks.","identification technology,data mining,automatic identification system data,data-driven nonparametric Bayesian model,Bayes methods,Marine vehicles,normal vessel behaviours,unsafe behaviour detection,informative data subsampling,Accuracy,illegal behaviour detection,Bayesian methods,sampling methods,real vessel data,Gaussian process active learning,United Kingdom,Data models,Gaussian processes,artificially generated AIS anomalies detection,maritime anomaly detection,artificial vessel data,training computational complexity,training,Training,behavioural sciences,computational complexity,normal shipping behaviour model,Computational modeling,suspicious behaviour detection,learning (artificial intelligence),newly-observed transmission,AIS data,"
"silicon impacts on soil microflora under ralstonia solanacearum inoculation","2020","Silicon (Si) can increase plant resistance against bacterial wilt caused by Ralstonia solanacearum and enhance plant immune response. However, whether Si alleviates soil-borne disease stress through altering soil microbial community component and diversity is not clear. In this study, effects of Si application under R. solanacearum inoculation with or without plant on soil bacterial and fungal communities were investigated through high-throughput pyrosequencing technique. The results showed that Si addition significantly reduced bacterial wilt incidence. However, Si did not reduce the amount of R. solanacearum in rhizosphere soil. Principal components analysis showed that soil microbial community composition was strongly influenced by Si addition. Total 63.7% bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and 43.8% fungal OTUs were regulated by Si addition regardless of the presence of tomato plants, indicating the independent effects of Si on soil microbial community. Si-added soil harbored a lower abundance of Fusarium, Pseudomonas, and Faecalibacterium. Our finding further demonstrated that exogenous Si could significantly influence soil microbial community component, and this may provide additional insight into the mechanism of Si-enhanced plant resistance against soil-borne pathogens.","bacterial wilt,silicon,soil microbial community,deep pyrosequencing,"
"13.10 glacial responses to climate change","2013","The response of glaciers to atmospheric warming has become a key issue in scientific as well as public and even political discussions about human impacts on the climate system. The predominant tendency of continued worldwide glacier shrinkage may indeed constitute one of the clearest indications in nature of rapid climate change at a global scale. More than a century of systematic and internationally coordinated observations provide quantitative documentation of this development and a basis for model developments in view of possible future scenarios. Mountain ranges at lower latitudes have lost large percentages of their glacier areas and volumes since the end of the Little Ice Age. Many of them may even become largely to even completely de-glaciated already during the coming decades. Such changes have the potential to profoundly affect environmental conditions in and around cold mountain chains. Sea-level rise, changing seasonality in water supply, and local formation of new lakes reflect changes in the water cycle at global, continental, and regional to local scales. They are accompanied by rather marked changes in landscape appearance, slope stability, erosion/sedimentation, and hazard conditions. The monitoring of glaciers itself faces difficult challenges of vanishing glaciers with long-term mass-balance observations. Modern techniques of spatial modeling increasingly help with integrated analysis of observed phenomena and early anticipation of possible developments.","Slope stability,Water cycle,High mountains,Runoff,Continental ice sheets,Sea level,Snow,Climate-system monitoring,Cryosphere,Climate change impacts,Permafrost,Glacier fluctuations,Sea ice,Lakes,Glacier inventories,"
"neural network-based automatic reconstruction of missing vessel trajectory data","2019","Automatic identification system (AIS) is an independent tracking system which has been widely utilized on ships to frequently broadcast the time-stamped vessel position reports. The generated massive AIS data can contribute to protecting maritime security and enhancing maritime transportation efficiency, such as maritime surveillance, anomaly detection and traffic route extraction, etc. However, the received AIS-based vessel trajectories commonly suffer from missing data due to network overload and bad weathers. To improve the quality of vessel trajectories for further researches, a two-step calculation method for vessel trajectory reconstruction is proposed in this work. In particular, the Random Forest method is introduced in the first step to automatically identify the missing position records within vessel trajectories. The missing data points could be accurately estimated from both theoretical and practical perspectives. The second step proposes a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based supervised learning method to reconstruct the vessel trajectories with missing AIS data. The LSTM-based reconstruction method is able to take full advantage of the similar geometrical features behind massive vessel trajectories. Experimental results have confirmed the superior performance of the proposed two-step method in terms of both effectiveness and robustness.","two-step calculation method,surveillance,missing position records,massive AIS data,LSTM-based reconstruction method,random forests,anomaly detection,transportation,Marine vehicles,trajectory reconstruction,maritime security,Random Forest method,long short-term memory-based supervised learning method,network overload,Radio frequency,Decision trees,neural nets,neural network-based automatic reconstruction,vessel trajectory data,ships,automatic identification system,marine safety,marine engineering,maritime surveillance,AIS-based vessel trajectories,trajectory data mining,time-stamped vessel position reports,Logic gates,massive vessel trajectories,Automatic identification system,missing AIS data,Trajectory,traffic route extraction,missing data points,vessel trajectory reconstruction,two-step method,independent tracking system,long short-term memory,maritime transportation efficiency,learning (artificial intelligence),tracking,bad weathers,"
"an early holocene westerly minimum in the southern mid-latitudes","2021","An important coupled ocean-atmospheric system in the mid- and high latitudes involves the Southern Westerly Winds (SWW) and the Southern Ocean (SO), which controls climate in the southernmost third of the world, deep water formation, and ventilation of CO2 from the deep ocean. Most studies have examined its role as a driver of atmospheric CO2 concentrations during glacial terminations, but very few have investigated its influence during the Holocene, i.e. the current interglacial. A fundamental problem, however, is resolving whether the SWW strength increased or declined during the early Holocene (∼11.5–7.5 ka, ka = 1000 cal yr BP) in sectors adjacent to the Drake Passage. Here we assess past changes in SWW influence over the last ∼17,000 years using terrestrial paleoclimate records from southwestern Patagonia (∼52°S). We detect a zonally symmetric Early Holocene Westerly Minimum which diminished wind stress and upwelling on the SO, contributing to a contemporary decline in atmospheric CO2 concentrations and enrichment in the stable carbon isotope ratio of atmospheric CO2 (δ13Catm). Our mid-latitude data also indicate a shift to strong SWW influence at ∼7.5 ka which correlates with a sustained increase in atmospheric CO2 and halt in the δ13Catm rise, suggesting enhancement of high-latitude ocean ventilation by an invigorated SWW-SO coupled system.","Southern middle latitudes,Early holocene westerly minimum,Southern westerly winds,Southwestern patagonia,Atmospheric CO2 holocene,"
"meteorological regimes modulating dust outbreaks in southwest asia: the role of pressure anomaly and inter-tropical convergence zone on the 1–3 july 2014 case","2015","The present work examines the characteristics (source regions, pathways, vertical profiles) as well as the meteorological conditions and the role of the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) during a dust event on 1–3 July 2014 over southwest (SW) Asia. NCEP/NCAR reanalysis, meteorological and satellite remote sensing (MODIS, Meteosat, CALIPSO) observations are utilized. The major dust storm (AOD550 up to 1.5–2.0) was generated in the southern Karakum desert in Turkmenistan as a result of intense north winds (Levar), due to enhanced pressure gradient between the Caspian Sea and Hindu Kush Mountains. The dust storm was vertically extended up to 5km over the arid terrain of SW Asia, as a consequence of the deep mixing layer and increased convection, while over northern Arabian Sea it was mixed with another dust plume coming from Arabia and marine aerosols due to strong monsoon winds within the boundary layer. The regional topography, variations in pressure, monsoon circulation and the position of the ITCZ play a decisive role on modulation of the wind field, dust-storm pathways and vertical distribution of dust. Enhanced knowledge of atmospheric circulation and processes responsible for dust export over SW Asia and Arabian Sea in linkage to the Levar wind and Indian summer monsoon is essential for improving dust forecasts and simulations over the region.","MSLP anomalies,SW Asia,ITCZ position,Dust storm,Karakum desert,Vertical dust distribution,"

"improving maritime traffic emission estimations on missing data with crbms","2020","Maritime traffic emissions are a major concern to governments as they heavily impact the Air Quality in coastal cities. Ships use the Automatic Identification System (AIS) to continuously report position and speed among other features, and therefore this data is suitable to be used to estimate emissions, if it is combined with engine data. However, important ship features are often inaccurate or missing. State-of-the-art complex systems, like CALIOPE at the Barcelona Supercomputing Center, are used to model Air Quality. These systems can benefit from AIS based emission models as they are very precise in positioning the pollution. Unfortunately, these models are sensitive to missing or corrupted data, and therefore they need data curation techniques to significantly improve the estimation accuracy. In this work, we propose a methodology for treating ship data using Conditional Restricted Boltzmann Machines (CRBMs) plus machine learning methods to improve the quality of data passed to emission models that can also be applied to other GPS and time-series problems. Results show that we can improve the default methods proposed to cover missing data. In our results, we observed that using our method the models boosted their accuracy to detect otherwise undetectable emissions. In particular, we used a real data-set of AIS data, provided by the Spanish Port Authority, to estimate that thanks to our method, the model was able to detect 45% of additional emissions, representing 152 tonnes of pollutants per week in Barcelona and propose new features that may enhance emission modeling.","CRBM,Data cleaning,Emission modeling,AIS,GPS,Ship time series,"

"a biogeochemical orientation survey in the moisan gold-mineralized area, haenam district in korea","2011","A biogeochemical orientation survey was carried out in the vicinity of an epithermal Au deposit in the Moisan Au–Ag mineralized area, Haenam district in Korea. The Au–Ag bearing quartz veins of the mine occur as narrow open-space fillings within Cretaceous silicic pyroclastics. The vein minerals consist mainly of quartz, sericite, pyrite, chalcopyrite, and galena, with some electrum and argentite. The main objectives of this study were to study the geochemical characteristics of rocks, soils and plants in this area, to investigate the spatial relationship between Au and associated elements in rock–soil–plant system, and to evaluate the applicability of biogeochemical prospecting for Au vein occurrences in Korea. Samples of rocks and soils, and leaves of three plant species (Japanese red pine — P. densiflora, oriental white oak — Q. aliena, Japanese mallotus — M. japonicus) were collected from the target mineralized area and control barren locations, and analyzed for trace elements by instrumental neutron activation analysis. Sampling lines were composed of one slope line which is almost parallel to the mineralized quartz-veins, and four transect lines spaced 100m apart across the veins at 20m sampling intervals. From the multi-element data of rock samples (n=9), high values of Au (maximum 2030ppb) are spatially related to Au–quartz veins. Soil samples (n=61) collected from five sampling lines show higher values of Au (24–825ppb) whereas soil samples from the control locations have lower values of Au (below 25ppb). Many plant species collected from the vicinity of the veins have high Au contents compared with those at the control locations, but the ranges of Au values are variable among plant species. In a total of 128 samples of plant leaves, Q. aliena yielded Au values of 0.4 to 6.9ppb, and M. japonicus 0.9 to 4.1ppb. Gold contents in P. densiflora ranged from 0.1 to 5.6ppb. Plant leaves from control areas show less than 1.6ppb Au. The biological absorption coefficient (BAC) of Au in plants decreases in the order of Q. aliena>M. japonicus>P. densiflora. Based on the results of the study, Q. aliena appeared to be the best sampling media for biogeochemical prospecting of Au in the study area.","Au anomaly,Biogeochemical survey,Gold–quartz veins,"
"wavelet-based despeckling for onboard image processing in a small satellite sar maritime surveillance constellation","2012","New developments in small spacecraft capabilities will soon enable formation-flying constellations of small satellites, capable of performing remote sensing missions at low cost.

Voluntary broadcasts of vessel position and velocity via AIS are received and decoded, and compared with SAR observations to verify the data and identify potentially non-cooperative vessels. Limited transmit power and downlink time will dictate that data be processed onboard the spacecraft.

"chapter 56 - tin","2015","Inorganic tin compounds occur naturally in the Earth’s crust. In the environment, tin can be found in both inorganic and organic forms. Inorganic tin compounds are released from natural and anthropogenic sources. The conversion of metallic tin forms to compounds that may be more soluble increases the risk of exposure and toxicity. Organotin compounds in the environment largely originate from anthropogenic activities. However, chemical and biochemical methylation reactions convert inorganic tin compounds into methyltin form. Biomethylation of alkyltins results in the accumulation of more toxic organotin compounds. Tin is not regarded an essential nutrient for humans. However, tin is considered an essential for the growth of rats, with a requirement for tin of between 1 and 2mg/kg in the diet. Elemental tin, inorganic tin compounds, and long-chain alkyltins are poorly absorbed when ingested, which accounts for their relatively low toxicity. The toxicity of organotin compounds depends on the length of alkyl chain, hydrophobicity, and other physicochemical properties. Hydrophobic organotins are toxic to a wide variety of organisms owing to their high solubility in cell membranes. The alkyl tins are more toxic than the aryl tins, whereas the toxicity of short-chain alkyltin compounds such as trimethyl- and triethyltin is higher than that of long-chain compounds: toxicity increases with number of alkyl groups. The excretory routes of tin compounds may vary depending of the type of compounds and the mode of exposure. Insoluble inorganic tin compounds are largely nontoxic. However, inhalation of tin dust results in its deposition in lungs and may cause “stannosis,” a benign pneumoconiosis. Some tin salts are irritating or can liberate toxic fumes during decomposition. Gastrointestinal absorption of soluble tin salts is only a few percent of the ingested dose. In chronic exposure, tin tends to accumulate in kidney, liver, and bones. Bones comprise a major site of deposition of tin after long-term exposure and intramuscular injection. The biological half-life of tin in bone is approximately 100 days. Exposure to high concentrations of inorganic tin may cause gastrointestinal illness, as well as liver and kidney problems. No noteworthy histopathological observations of nonneoplastic nature were reported in a long-term study. Short-chain alkyls are easily absorbed from gastrointestinal tract. Some alkyltin compounds, particularly tributyltin and triphenyltin, have high toxicity. Chronic exposure to butyltin compounds causes imposex, a pathological condition characterized by development of male sex characteristics in female gastropods. Toxicity of organotins in humans is most frequently reported as loss of memory and seizure, as well as other symptoms including death. Short-chain alkyltin, particularly the trialkyl derivatives, and aromatic tin compounds are neurotoxic. Hydrophobic trimethyltin and triethyltin compounds readily diffuse into richly lipophilic tissues such as brain and cause encephalopathy, cerebral edema, and severe seizures. Tetraalkyltins are enzymatically converted to the trisubstituted form and exert delayed but similar neurotoxic effects. Tributyltin compounds are less toxic than trimethyl- and triethyltins. They may be strongly irritating to the skin in humans. It was reported that shipyard workers exposed to tributyltin oxide developed severe dermatitis, difficulty in breathing, and flu-like symptoms. Trisubstituted organotin derivatives are implicated in hepatotoxicity, immunodeficiency, endocrine disruption, and both reproductive anomalies and infertility in laboratory animals. Monobutyltin and dibutyltin show genotoxicity, while mono- and dimethyltin are not genotoxic. Organotin compounds penetrate the cell membrane and interrupt oxidative phosphorylation, disturb calcium homeostasis, damage mitochondria, and induce apoptosis.","biocompatibility,detection methods,mechanism of toxicity,metabolism,organotins,risk assessment,tin,environment,"

An area averaged mean value of AIRS CO at 600hPa is found to be 114±2ppbv (slope −0.48±0.2ppbvyr−1, y-intercept 117±1ppbv and r=0.68) with a minor declining trend at −0.41±0.18%yr−1 over the region during 2003–2015. A strong seasonality in AIRS CO concentration is observed with spring season peak in March 129±1.9ppbv, whereas low values have been observed in summer monsoon with sturdy dip in July 99.6±1.94ppbv. AIRS CO and SCIAMACHY CO Total Column (CO TC) over the study region show spatial patterns similar to MACCity and REAS emissions. An analysis of SCIAMACHY CO TC tendencies has been performed which indicates minor rising trends over some parts of the region. Background CO, Recent Emissions (RE), and spatial anomalies in RE over high anthropogenic activity zones of Indus Basin, Ganges Basin and Eastern Region were analyzed using AIRS and SCIAMACHY CO data.","AIRS,REAS,Tropospheric Co,MACCity,SCIAMACHY,Climate change,"
"analyzing congestion interdependencies of ports and container ship routes in the maritime network infrastructure","2018","Events, such as prolonged congestion in ports or unavailable ship routes in the maritime network, often initiate cascading congestions that block transportation and/or disrupt services over wide areas. Existing traffic flow analysis methods lack the ability to understand the cascading effects of delays in ship routes or how to reduce overall delays in greater maritime areas. Dependency risk graphs have been proposed as a tool for analyzing such cascading events using dependency chains. This paper proposes a risk-based interdependency analysis method capable to detect large-scale traffic congestions between interconnected ports and ship routes in the maritime network and provide solutions to improve flow. Presented dependency risk chains of ports along with graph theory help us analyze ship routes and detect ports that are affected most when other major ports are congested in the maritime network, detect the causes of bottlenecks, and provide valuable info in relieving delays across container ship routes. We apply the proposed method on historical container ship routing data provided by the MarineTraffic company that maintains a comprehensive maritime database worldwide for more than six million users monthly. This application-oriented, interdisciplinary effort culminated in a prototype tool is able to analyze the historical data for container ships in the entire global maritime network and detect congestion dependencies. The tool can be used to identify key shipping routes or ports that: 1) are prone to delays; 2) greatly affect the overall maritime network due to position, connections and risk of congestion; and/or 3) get affected the most by delays in previous route legs.","maritime database worldwide,cascading effects,Transportation,telecommunication network routing,graph,congestion interdependency analysis,centrality,vehicle routing,interconnected ports,transportation,Marine vehicles,sector,Delays,Mathematical model,Maritime,infrastructure,cascading,delay,Containers,ships,dependency risk chains,container,risk-based interdependency analysis method,dependency,flow,congestion,MarineTraffic company,impact,global maritime network infrastructure,sea ports,historical container ship routing data,containers,traffic flow analysis methods,graph theory,large-scale traffic congestion detection,risk,marine communication,Tools,route,Analytical models,port,"
"a merchant ship thermo-salinograph network in the pacific ocean","1996","The need for better knowledge of sea surface salinity (SSS) and sea surface temperature (SST) distribution in the tropical oceans was brought to light during the 10 years of the TOGA programme (1985–1994). In order to improve on the original “meteorological bucket” method of sampling, we developed a network of merchant ships among those operating regular routes through the tropical Pacific, and equipped them with thermo-salinographs. Accurate positioning of the ships was obtained using a satellite positioning system. High frequency sampling (every 15 s) and recording of the median values for every 5 min resulted in quite precise monitoring of the SST and SSS, and in a description of the salinity fronts along the routes followed by the ships. Using this equipment, we were able to detect the influence of local rainfall on salinity and temperature and the diurnal cycle of sea surface temperature. The accuracy of salinity measurements (0.02) was better than that of the old sampling technique by one order of magnitude. Temperature measurement by the thermo-salinograph was very stable but yielded results that are 0.2–0.3°C higher than sea surface temperature. To ensure reliability of data, the equipment was carefully checked every time the ships called at Noumea (i.e. every 2–3 months), and re-calibration every year or two is essential.",""
"tracing illegal oil discharges from vessels using sar and ais in bohai sea of china","2021","In China's 14th Five-Year Plan, it is necessary to coordinate the promotion of marine ecological protection and prevent environmental risks such as marine oil spills. The illegal discharge of oily waste from ships is an important source of oil spill pollution in the Bohai Sea, and has become an important factor hindering the purification of the marine environment. Because SAR remote sensing is not restricted by light conditions, it can work at night, in heavy fog, overcast and rainy days, and has become one of the important techniques for monitoring oil spills on the sea. AIS can provide real-time and historical position and track information of ships. The combination of SAR and AIS can provide a great help for maritime regulatory authorities to find the source of oil spill pollution. However, China has not yet established a mature and effective oil spill supervision system based on SAR and AIS. This paper proposes a framework for oil spill detection and accountability using the combination of SAR, AIS and boarding inspection, and takes an example of the monitoring and tracking process of illegal oil discharge from a ship in the Bohai Sea. As far as we know, this is the first time that China has used SAR and AIS to identify ships that illegally discharge oily sewage. This work framework can provide a reference for China's maritime agencies to improve the oil spill supervision system during the 14th Five-Year Plan.","Synthetic aperture radar,Illegal discharge,Automatic identification system,Oil spill,"
"detecting maneuvers in maritime observation data with cusum","2017","Understanding and building suitable marine traffic and prediction models is a difficult undertaking. To build such a model, it is necessary to understand vessels behavior and have knowledge about the driving patterns. In general, a complex dynamic model for several ship types is used. Maritime sensors like AIS or radar do not always provide the necessary information, like vessel size or type. That is why a simpler solution for detecting maneuvers in maritime observation data is needed. We present a light approach to detect maneuver in maritime observation data without information about the vessel dynamic. For the maneuver detection, we use the CUSUM method which is normally be used in change point detection and use it for geospatial data.

"traffic pattern detection using the hough transformation for anomaly detection to improve maritime domain awareness","2014","Techniques for extracting traffic patterns from ship position data to generate atlases of expected ocean travel are developed in this paper. An archive of historical data is used to develop a traffic density grid. The Hough transformation is used to extract linear patterns of elevated density from the traffic density grid, which can be considered the â€œhighwaysâ€ of the oceans. These highways collectively create an atlas that is used to define geographical regions of expected ship locations. The atlas generation techniques are demonstrated using automated information system (AIS) ship position data to detect highways in both open-ocean and coastal areas. Additionally, the atlas generation techniques are used to explore variability in ship traffic as a result of extreme weather.

"two-stage offloading optimization for energyâ€“latency tradeoff with mobile edge computing in maritime internet of things","2020","The ever-increasing growth in maritime activities with large amounts of Maritime Internet-of-Things (M-IoT) devices and the exploration of ocean network leads to a great challenge for dealing with a massive amount of maritime data in a cost-effective and energy-efficient way. However, the resources-constrained maritime users cannot meet the high requirements of transmission delay and energy consumption, due to the excessive traffic and limited resources in maritime networks. To solve this problem, mobile edge computing is taken as a promising paradigm to help mobile devices from edge servers via computation offloading considering the different quality of service (QoS) with the complex ocean environments, resulting in energy saving and increased transmission latency. To investigate the tradeoff between latency and energy consumption in low-cost large-scale maritime communication, we formulate the offloading optimization problem and propose a two-stage joint optimal offloading algorithm, optimizing computation and communication resource allocation under limited energy and sensitive latency. At the first stage, the maritime users make the decision on whether to offload a computation considering their demands and environments. Then, the channel allocation and power allocation problems were proposed to optimize the offloading policy which coordinates with the center cloud servers at the second stage, considering the dynamic tradeoff of latency and energy consumption. Finally, numerical simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.","offloading strategies,telecommunication power management,channel allocation,computation offloading,maritime data,limited resources,ocean network,dynamic tradeoff,two-stage joint optimal offloading algorithm,energy-efficiency,resources-constrained maritime users,QoS,Internet of Things,quality of service,Marine vehicles,Maritime Internet-of-Things,Resource management,large-scale maritime communication,mobile edge computing (MEC),two-stage offloading optimization,Servers,Energy???latency tradeoff,cloud computing,maritime networks,Oceans,optimisation,communication resource allocation,mobile computing,mobile edge computing,energy-latency tradeoff,offloading policy,maritime Internet of Things (M-IoT),network traffic,energy saving,transmission delay,telecommunication traffic,complex ocean environments,energy consumption,mobile devices,Cloud computing,marine communication,power allocation problems,cloud server,offloading optimization problem,Task analysis,maritime activities,resource allocation,edge servers,M-IoT devices,"

"a fast sar image position algorithm for maritime target location","2016","In order to find the maritime targets location in SAR image accurately, a fast R-D algorithm is introduced in this paper and it can solve targets location problems which are in the sea area. The real latitude and longitude coordinates measure system and geographical coordinates are built up for SAR image, then the targets located in the sea can be point out. First, based on information in SAR satellite data headers the Doppler center frequency coefficients can be calculated. Then the parameters are carried in the R-D pattern for calculate four vertex coordinates of SAR image. Generally the solution of R-D pattern is an iterative process, here a fast algorithm is proposed which combined with slope distance, Doppler parameters and earth model to reduce variables, then and the position of SAR is calculated and the latitude and longitude coordinates of target is also obtained. Second, the SAR image geocoding can be made up and the target in SAR image over sea can be found out. Finally, compare these results with AIS data, the accuracy of location is analyzed. The result shows that the deviation of distance location is less than 200 meters, and the deviation of azimuth is less than 6'. The error is reasonable for real application.

"structural health monitoring of harbor caissons using support vector machine and principal component analysis","2021","Harbor caissons are regarded as one of the most critical infrastructures, and any disruption in their operation would have dramatic economic consequences. The need for a health monitoring system for these structures is thus evident. The primary aim of this study is to develop a structural health monitoring (SHM) system to effectively detect damage in harbor caissons. To this end, through performing dynamic analysis, acceleration signals are extracted from the locations in the model corresponding to the presumed accelerometer's placement in an actual structure. Three levels of white Gaussian noises are added to the original signal to simulate the ambient noise. Using the acquired signals, the damage-sensitive features in both frequency and time domains are determined in the structure. In this study, leveraging Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Support Vector Machine (SVM), the damage-sensitive features associated with the damaged and undamaged structure are reduced in dimensionality and classified. Hence, the introduced system can assess the state of the structure based on the input signal from the accelerometer and detect possible damage and its severity. The effectiveness of the proposed system in detecting damage is shown using the numerical model of a real harbor caisson.","Support vector machine (SVM),Principal component analysis (PCA),Finite element (FE) modeling,Structural health monitoring,Autoregressive (AR) model,Machine learning,Harbor caissons,"

"meteorological analysis of chemical exchange events in the arctic basin","1995","Analysis of chemical or aerosol exchange from the troposphere to the arctic surface is considerably more complex than similar analysis of Antarctic events. The complexity of chemical or aerosol exchange experiments in the Arctic requires considering occasional frontal exchange similar to that of the mid-latitudes, potential local contamination, and local sources of heat and moisture. These concerns are eliminated through site selection in most Antarctic exchange experiments. The inherent stability of near-surface layers in the arctic tropopause causes temporal anomalies when arrival times of aerosol or gaseous contaminants are compared with conservative meteorological tracers, further complicating the analysis. Three cases are presented. One illustrates the complexity in analyzing aerosol related to a warming event, the second describes the dimensions of a deep tropospheric mixing in the Arctic Basin, and the third examines the diurnal exchange of aerosol in the arctic summer. Some criteria relative to temporal resolution of aerosol and chemical measurements with respect to meteorological processes are proposed. Potential problems in distinguishing properties of aerosols transported from lower latitudes, in the presence of local aerosol sources, are discussed.","Arctic meteorology,Arctic chemical exchange,Arctic ozone exchange,Arctic aerosol exchange,Carbon dioxide-water vapour,Arctic basin,"

"changes of extreme precipitation in the philippines, projected from the cmip6 multi-model ensemble","2022","The Philippines is highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change including increased frequency of extreme weather events such as very heavy rainfall. Extreme rain events have resulted in landslides and floods, accompanied with a loss of life and the deterioration of infrastructure. To project the future changes of extreme precipitation in Philippines, we investigated the observations based on 53 stations and 24 CMIP6 (Coupled Model Inter-Comparison Project Phase 6) models. We applied generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution and multivariate bias-correction to series of annual maximum daily precipitation (AMP1) data acquired from the observations and models under three shared socioeconomic pathway (SSP) scenarios (SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5). We employed a model ensemble method that takes both independence and performance of model into account, which is named as the PI-weighting. To quantify the uncertainty of predicting the future AMP1, variance decomposition method was applied. Return values for 20-year and 50-year as well as the return periods of the AMP1 compared to the past (1975–2014), were estimated for two future time which are period 1 (2021–2060) and period 2 (2061–2100). From this study, we predict that the relative increases of 20-year return value of the AMP1 from the past to the year 2100 be about 8.5% in the SSP2-4.5, 11.6% in the SSP3-7.0, and 17% in the SSP5-8.5 scenarios, respectively, in the spatial median over the Philippines. We also found out that a 1-in-20 year (1-in-50 year) AMP1 observed in the past in the Philippines will likely become a 1-in-16 (1-in-37) year, a 1-in-17 (1-in-32) year, and a 1-in-14 (1-in-31) year event by 2100 under the SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 scenarios, respectively.

"lagrangian analysis of multi-satellite data in support of open ocean marine protected area design","2017","Compared to ecosystem conservation in territorial seas, protecting the open ocean has peculiar geopolitical, economic and scientific challenges. One of the major obstacle is defining the boundary of an open ocean Marine Protected Area (MPA). In contrast to coastal ecosystems, which are mostly constrained by topographic structures fixed in time, the life of marine organisms in the open ocean is entrained by fluid dynamical structures like eddies and fronts, whose lifetime occurs on ecologically-relevant timescales. The position of these highly dynamical structures can vary interannually by hundreds of km, and so too will regions identified as ecologically relevant such as the foraging areas of marine predators. Thus, the expected foraging locations suggested from tracking data cannot be directly extrapolated beyond the year in which the data were collected. Here we explore the potential of Lagrangian methods applied to multisatellite data as a support tool for a MPA proposal by focusing on the Crozet archipelago oceanic area (Indian Sector of the Southern Ocean). By combining remote sensing with biologging information from a key marine top predator (Eudyptes chrysolophus, or Macaroni penguin) of the Southern Ocean foodweb, we identify a highly dynamic branch of the Subantarctic front as a foraging hotspot. By tracking this feature in historical satellite data (1993–2012) we are able to extrapolate the position of this foraging ground beyond the years in which tracking data are available and study its spatial variability.",""
"use of noma for maritime communication networks with p-df relaying channel","2020","In this paper, a partial de-code-and-forward (P-DF) cooperative relaying network (CRN) with non-orthogonal multiple access (P-DF-CRN-NOMA) for maritime space communications is proposed. Without loss of generality, three kinds of relay forwarding protocols are studied to characterize the superiority of the proposed P-DF-CRN-NOMA scheme, where, after receptions from the coastal base station (BS), the island relay forwards the successful decoded symbols to the ship user to avoid the performance loss provided by the high decoding requirement in decode-and-forward (DF). To further improve the system performance, as well as for a fairness comparison, the maximum ratio combining (MRC) is utilized at the ship user. Specifically, to present the impact of the channel qualities, the scenarios of the weak and strong links that from the source to destination (S-D) are both considered. The closed-form expressions for the outage probability of the P-DF-CRN-NOMA are derived considering the three proposed forwarding cases. Qualitative numerical results corroborating our theoretical analysis, especially for the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), show that the proposed P-DF-CRN-NOMA scheme significantly improves the outage probability performance in comparison to the conventional CRN-NOMA schemes. Furthermore, for an increased S-D link, the corresponding outage probability performance will be also better for all the cases.","Decoding,telecommunication network reliability,cooperative relaying networks (CRN),nonorthogonal multiple access,Marine vehicles,non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA),maritime space communications,outage probability,decoding,Power system reliability,NOMA,Communication networks,Relays,error statistics,power allocation,P-DF relaying channel,maximum ratio combining,cooperative relaying network,protocols,relay networks (telecommunication),diversity reception,partial decode and forward network,coastal base station,decode and forward communication,cooperative communication,probability,relay forwarding protocols,marine communication,outage probability performance,Probability,maritime communication networks,multi-access systems,island relay,partial decode-and-for-ward (P-DF),P-DF-CRN-NOMA scheme,"

Improvement to the associative learning law for learning temporal associations between vessel events enables conditional probabilities between events to be learned incrementally and locally. This allows weights in the learned model to be interpreted more readily, enabling better location prediction performance.

"pitting corrosion identification approach based on inverse finite element method for marine structure applications","2023","This paper presents a state-of-the art inverse finite element method (iFEM) for full-field, real-time structural health monitoring (SHM) of corroding structures. The study focuses on detecting the location and identifying the extent of pitting corrosion, which is one of the most hazardous forms of corrosion due to the difficulties regarding its prediction and detection. For this purpose, high-fidelity finite element (FE) models of corroded samples with complex-shaped, semi-ellipsoidal, and cylindroconical defects are developed to replicate the strain field of pitting corroded structures. The strain fields produced by the FE models, verified against experimental data, are reconstructed by the iFEM model using a robust and practical four-node quadrilateral inverse-shell element, iQS4. A strain-based damage criterion is defined to obtain the damage distribution and the location of corrosion pits on dog-bone tensile test samples with full sensor iFEM and coupled iFEM-GA reduced sensor technique. Finally, in a practical example of a structure with complex geometry, the proposed method's performance is assessed through detecting the location of corrosion damage on a cylindrical marine structure with axial stiffeners.","Structural health monitoring,Marine structures,Corrosion damage detection,Inverse finite element,"
"modelling fire perimeter formation in the canadian rocky mountains","2022","Wildfires produce a mosaic of burned and unburned patches across varying temporal and spatial scales and provide a range of essential ecosystem services. Fire perimeters mark the separation between the burned and unburned matrix of a fire. Analysis of fire perimeters in the United States, Australia, and Alberta, have identified several key factors that influence the formation of a fire boundary, including fire environment variables, such as fuel, weather, and topographic conditions, as well as anthropogenic factors. We used matched case-control conditional logistic regression to assess the fire environment's influence on the formation of fire boundaries on the 2017 Verdant Creek Fire in the western Canadian Rocky Mountain region. Results indicated that fire boundary formation was strongly influenced by non-fuels, alpine and subalpine vegetation, wetland areas, and low and sparse shrub assemblages generally associated with avalanche paths. Fire cessation was more likely near waterways; however, the fire weather conditions that characterized most burning periods likely overrode other topographic influences. Fire cessation was most likely to occur one day following precipitation events when Vapour Pressure Deficit and Fire Weather Index values decreased. To explore the potential influence of spatial data resolution and fire mapping limitations on our results, we varied the distance between matched sample points selected on each side of the mapped fire perimeter during statistical modelling. Results demonstrated matched pairs of burned and unburned sample points were effective at representing discrete states when separated by at least 100 m and that insufficient or excessive separation between matched pairs confounds results, highlighting the importance of sensitivity analysis for determining the appropriate separation distance to represent burned and unburned states.

"spatial assessment and source identification of heavy metals pollution in surface water using several chemometric techniques","2016","This study presents the determination of the spatial variation and source identification of heavy metal pollution in surface water along the Straits of Malacca using several chemometric techniques. Clustering and discrimination of heavy metal compounds in surface water into two groups (northern and southern regions) are observed according to level of concentrations via the application of chemometric techniques. Principal component analysis (PCA) demonstrates that Cu and Cr dominate the source apportionment in northern region with a total variance of 57.62% and is identified with mining and shipping activities. These are the major contamination contributors in the Straits. Land-based pollution originating from vehicular emission with a total variance of 59.43% is attributed to the high level of Pb concentration in the southern region. The results revealed that one state representing each cluster (northern and southern regions) is significant as the main location for investigating heavy metal concentration in the Straits of Malacca which would save monitoring cost and time.

"a-contrario structural inference for space object detection and tracking","2022","Monitoring space assets for safety and sustainability compliance requires active measurement of positional information, commonly done via optical remote sensing in which image-frame coordinates are extracted from a high-noise environment of stellar, atmospheric, and hardware features. This task has been traditionally approached by using a-priori models to differentiate potential Anthropogenic Space Objects from the background noise. Source extraction and track-before-detect methods rely on absolute pixel intensity thresholding and require substantial processing to remove noise (stars, hot pixels, etc.), while machine learning shows promise in reducing processing and improving low-visibility performance but requires context-specific labeled training data. We introduce a new approach based on a-contrario detection, arguing that any space object must be unattributable to noise using a sequence of low-fidelity hypotheses. Through this approach, we aim to relax the dependency on a-priori assumptions of data content and improve performance where high-quality data is sparse, poorly labeled, or challenging to characterize, e.g., in satellite-based applications, and provide detection confidence measures from individual data content to enhance risk evaluation for orbital populations. We present an initial qualitative proof-of-concept for our a-contrario approach using data collected by the ASTRIANet telescope network, showing potentially strong performance on Medium Earth Orbit observations for both rate and sidereal-tracking telescope modes. We also discuss how our approach handles epistemic uncertainties, i.e., a lack of a-priori model information, with implications to Type I and Type II error sources and potential mitigation steps when considering Low Earth Orbit observations with higher tracking noise.","Object tracking,A-contrario detection,Space domain awareness,Image processing,"

"interval prediction of vessel trajectory based on lower and upper bound estimation and attention-modified lstm with bayesian optimization","2023","Uncertainty prediction of vessel trajectory is essential to enhance maritime situational awareness and traffic safety. Traditional approaches for trajectory prediction face challenges in accurately quantifying uncertainties, thereby limiting effectiveness in decision-making. To address this challenge, we propose a hybrid interval prediction frame of vessel trajectory using the lower and upper bound estimation (LUBE) and attention-modified long short-term memory (LSTM) network with bayesian optimization (BO). Firstly, trajectory data is preprocessed to solve the scale irregularity. Then, a novel trajectory interval prediction model for perceiving the prediction uncertainties is designed based on an advanced attention-modified LSTM with interval prediction capability. Meanwhile, a supervised training strategy with differentiating the interval widths of latitude and longitude is put forward to devise sample labels for training the model. Additionally, a new prediction interval-based objective function is proposed considering the target of maximizing coverage and minimizing width of trajectory interval. The BO algorithm optimizes the weighted parameters in the LSTM network by minimizing the objective function value. Finally, cases from two water areas are implemented to test and verify the proposed method. The results illustrate the superiority of the proposed approach in (1) outperforming other methods used for comparison in both coverage probability and width criteria of prediction interval. (2) quantifying the prediction uncertainty and improving the reliability of trajectory predictor. (3) performing anomaly detection tasks using visualized trajectory prediction intervals. The research can help maritime traffic participants obtain more reliable trajectory data, which supports making more reasonable traffic supervision decisions.","Long short-term memory,Attention mechanism,Vessel trajectory,Lower and upper bound estimation (LUBE),Interval prediction,"
"maritime small target detection based on appearance stability and depth-normalized motion saliency in infrared video with dense sunglints","2023","Maritime infrared (IR) small target detection in dense sunglint environments has always been challenging. It is difficult for existing methods to distinguish the small target from dense and strong sea clutter because the sea clutter caused by the sunglints has similar spatialâ€“temporal characteristics to small targets. This article proposes a method based on appearance stability and depth-normalized motion saliency (AS-DNMS) for small target detection in IR videos or sequences. First, on each frame of the IR video, the isotropic salience measure (ISM) based on principal curvature filtering is proposed for target enhancement, and an adaptive threshold is used to extract a stable number of candidate targets. Then, we use improved pipeline filtering to form trajectory chains of the candidate targets extracted from the consecutive frames. To improve the matching accuracy of pipeline filtering, we propose an inverse optical flow method to predict the local images of the candidate targets. Third, the motion vectors of the candidate targets are extracted and depth-normalized. According to the principle of projection perspective, a depth normalization model based on the position of the sea-sky line is established, providing a simple and low-cost solution for acquiring depth information of maritime targets under sea-sky backgrounds. Finally, the appearance stability measure (ASM) and the depth-normalized motion saliency measure (DNMSM) are calculated to construct the AS-DNMS joint feature. A double asymptote decision function is employed to determine the real target. The experimental results show that our method has better detection performance in dense sunglint environments than the baseline methods.","Appearance stability and depth-normalized motion saliency (AS-DNMS),Pipelines,target detection,radar clutter,target enhancement,Sea measurements,IR video,dense sunglint environment,strong sea clutter,isotropic salience measure (ISM),object detection,dense sunglints,feature extraction,maritime targets,Sea surface,improved pipeline filtering,infrared (IR) small target detection,depth-normalized motion saliency measure,dense sunglint environments,depth normalization model,Trajectory,image sequences,Tensors,Clutter,Object detection,appearance stability measure,infrared video,sequences,candidate targets,sea-sky line,isotropic salience measure,pipeline filtering,dense sea clutter,"
"sa-hpmht for maritime dim targets tracking with sensor location uncertainty","2023","To address the problem of tracking low signal-to-clutter ratio (SCR) maritime targets with sensor location uncertainty, an effective track-before-detect (TBD) method, called the state augmentation histogram probabilistic multihypothesis tracking (SA-HPMHT) algorithm, is proposed in this article. In this algorithm, the initialization of new tracks is realized based on the constant false alarm rate (CFAR) detector with a low threshold and the  ${K}$ -means clustering algorithm. The target and sensor states are then simultaneously estimated in an iterative manner via a synthetic histogram and state augmentation (SA) method. In each iteration, we update the estimated sensor state and yield more accurate measured images, allowing for improved performance of detection and tracking targets. Finally, an  ${M}/{N}$  logic technology is invoked to confirm or terminate the tracks.

"physical-biological drivers modulating phytoplankton seasonal succession along the northern antarctic peninsula","2023","The Northern Antarctic Peninsula (NAP) shows shifts in phytoplankton distribution and composition along its warming marine ecosystems. However, despite recent efforts to mechanistically understand these changes, little focus has been given to the phytoplankton seasonal succession, remaining uncertainties regarding to distribution patterns of emerging taxa along the NAP. To fill this gap, we collected phytoplankton (pigment and microscopy analysis) and physico-chemical datasets during spring and summer (November, February and March) of 2013/2014 and 2014/2015 off the NAP. Satellite measurements (sea surface temperature, sea ice concentration and chlorophyll-a) were used to extend the temporal coverage of analysis associated with the in situ sampling. We improved the quantification and distribution pattern of emerging taxa, such as dinoflagellates and cryptophytes, and described a contrasting seasonal behavior and distinct fundamental niche between centric and pennate diatoms. Cryptophytes and pennate diatoms preferentially occupied relatively shallower mixing layers compared with centric diatoms and dinoflagellates, suggesting differences between these groups in distribution and environment occupation over the phytoplankton seasonal succession. Under colder conditions, negative sea surface temperature anomalies were associated with positive anomalies of sea ice concentration and duration. Therefore, based on sea ice–phytoplankton growth relationship, large phytoplankton biomass accumulation was expected during the spring/summer of 2013/2014 and 2014/2015 along the NAP. However, there was a decoupling between sea ice concentration/duration and phytoplankton biomass, characterizing two seasonal periods of low biomass accumulation (negative chlorophyll-a anomalies), associated with the top-down control in the region. These results provide an improved mechanistic understanding on physical-biological drivers modulating phytoplankton seasonal succession along the Antarctic coastal waters.","Shifts,Top-down control,Upper ocean physical structures,Southern ocean,Phytoplankton taxa,Climate change,"
"grid size optimization for potential field based maritime anomaly detection","2014","This study focuses on improving the potential field based maritime data modeling method, developed to extract traffic patterns and detect anomalies, in a clear, understandable and informative way. The method's novelty lies in employing the concept of a potential field for AIS vessel tracking data abstraction and maritime traffic representation. Unlike the traditional maritime surveillance equipment, such as radar or GPS, the AIS system comprehensively represents the identity and properties of a vessel, as well as its behavior, thus preserving the effects of navigational decisions, based on the skills of experienced seamen. In the developed data modeling process, every vessel generates potential charges, which value represent the vessel's behavior, and drops the charges at locations it passes. Each AIS report is used to assign a potential charge at the reported vessel positions. The method derives three construction elements, which define, firstly, how charges are accumulated, secondly, how a charge decays over time, and thirdly, in what way the potential is distributed around the source charge. The collection of potential fields represents a model of normal behavior, and vessels not conforming to it are marked as anomalous. In the anomaly detection prototype system STRAND, the sensitivity of anomaly detection can be modified by setting a geographical coordinate grid precision to more dense or coarse. The objective of this study is to identify the optimal grid size for two different conditions – an open sea and a port area case. A noticeable shift can be observed between the results for the open sea and the port area. The plotted detection rates converge towards an optimal ratio for smaller grid sizes in the port area (60-200 meters), than in the open sea case (300-1000 meters). The effective outcome of the potential filed based anomaly detection is filtering out all vessels behaving normally and presenting a set of anomalies, for a subsequent incident analysis using STRAND as an information visualization tool.","maritime traffic,potential field,anomaly detection,AIS,"

"feature enhancement and supervised contrastive learning for image splicing forgery detection","2023","Image forgery detection remains a challenging task due to the variation in the scale of the tampered areas and the forensic clues that are obscured by various post-processing operations. Most existing deep learning methods rely only on single-scale high-level features and ignore the correlations of the pixels in intra-image and inter-image. Due to this limitation, previous methods are considered unsuitable for multi-scale splicing forgery detection. To fill this gap, we propose a novel model for improving multi-scale splicing forged regions localization by utilizing multi-level multi-scale feature enhancement and pixel-level supervised contrastive learning. First, we introduce a multi-level multi-scale feature enhancement module (MFEM) to integrate the multi-level information and capture the multi-scale global contextual representation by embedding an improved atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) mechanism into the non-local module. It strengthens the capability of the model to sense multi-scale tampered regions. Second, the pixel-level supervised contrastive learning mechanism is designed to separately cluster the pixel representations of tampered and real regions within and across images. It improves intra-class compactness and inter-class separability of the pixel embedding space significantly and enhances feature expression capabilities. Third, we design a multi-loss progressive learning (MPL) strategy to integrate the complementary advantages of multi-loss functions to optimize the scale and position parameters of the tampered regions during the training process. Extensive experiments have shown that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods. It can effectively detect and segment multi-scale tampered regions, even for noisy and JPEG-compressed images.","Supervised contrastive learning,Feature enhancement,Global contextual representations,Image forgery,"

"deeptracks: geopositioning maritime vehicles in video acquired from a moving platform","2021","Geopositioning and tracking a moving boat at sea is a very challenging problem, requiring boat detection, matching and estimating its GPS location from imagery with no common features. The problem can be stated as follows: given imagery from a camera mounted on a moving platform with known GPS location as the only valid sensor, we predict the geoposition of a target boat visible in images. Our solution uses recent ML algorithms, the camera-scene geometry and Bayesian filtering. The proposed pipeline first detects and tracks the target boatâ€™s location in the image with the strategy of tracking by detection. This image location is then converted to geoposition to the local sea coordinates referenced to the camera GPS location using plane projective geometry. Finally, target boat local coordinates are transformed to global GPS coordinates to estimate the geoposition. To achieve a smooth geotrajectory, we apply unscented Kalman filter (UKF) which implicitly overcomes small detection errors in the early stages of the pipeline. We tested the performance of our approach using GPS ground truth and show the accuracy and speed of the estimated geopositions.

"detecting anomalous deviations from standard maritime routes using the ornsteinâ€“uhlenbeck process","2018","A novel anomaly detection procedure based on the Ornsteinâ€“Uhlenbeck (OU) mean-reverting stochastic process is presented. The considered anomaly is a vessel that deviates from a planned route, changing its nominal velocity $\boldsymbol{v}_0$. In order to hide this behavior, the vessel switches off its automatic identification system (AIS) device for a time  $T$ and then tries to revert to the previous nominal velocity $\boldsymbol{v}_0$. The decision that has to be made is declaring that a deviation either happened or not, relying only upon two consecutive AIS contacts. Furthermore, the extension to the scenario in which multiple contacts (e.g., radar) are available during the time period $T$ is also considered. A proper statistical hypothesis testing procedure that builds on the changes in the OU process long-term velocity parameter $\boldsymbol{v}_0$ of the vessel is the core of the proposed approach and enables the solution of the anomaly detection problem.

"fusion of camera-based vessel detection and ais for maritime surveillance","2021","Camera-based vessel identification is one of the essential maritime surveillance measures.

This paper proposed a fusion framework, which takes the visual detection and the automatic identification system (AIS) as inputs to obtain accurate and robust vessel identification to address these challenges. Visual detection uses an innovative method to estimate the distance of the identified vessel target from the camera and the azimuth angle relative to the camera based on the images from the monocular camera.

"vertical profile of aerosol characteristics including activation over a rain shadow region in india","2021","Unique airborne observations of aerosol size spectral and chemical characteristics over the peninsular Indian region are illustrated in this case study. Multimodal lognormal distributions were required to fit the observed in situ aerosol size distribution. The aerosol composition and mixing state was deduced from the single-particle analyses of aerosols using the transmission electron microscope and soot photometer coupled with satellite retrieved aerosol classification, and back trajectory analyses. Organic carbon was the most prominent aerosol type found at all altitudes. Refractory black carbon aerosols which constituted about 10–12% of the aerosols in the boundary layer were primarily internally mixed with both inorganic and organic coating. Other major aerosol types were dust and sea salt, with the latter primarily found below 2 km. Further, the cloud forming ability of in-situ aerosols is tested through a cloud condensation nuclei closure analysis. The effective hygroscopicity decreased above cloud base due to the absence of sea salt aerosols. The change in large-scale winds with altitude affected the aerosol composition and hygroscopicity. The multimodal aerosol size distribution and hygroscopicity parameter (κ = 0.18) obtained for the cloud base aerosols over the rain shadow region are useful for studying aerosol-cloud interactions using regional cloud-resolving models.","CCN closure,CAIPEEX,Solapur,Lognormal distribution,Hygroscopicity parameter,"
"aerosols heat up the himalayan climate","2023","The impact of aerosols, especially the absorbing aerosols, in the Himalayan region is important for climate. We closely examine ground-based high-quality observations of aerosol characteristics including radiative forcing from several locations in the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP), the Himalayan foothills and the Tibetan Plateau, relatively poorly studied regions with several sensitive ecosystems of global importance, as well as highly vulnerable large populations. This paper presents a state-of-the-art treatment of the warming that arises from these particles, using a combination of new measurements and modeling techniques. This is a first-time analysis of its kind, including ground-based observations, satellite data, and model simulations, which reveals that the aerosol radiative forcing efficiency (ARFE) in the atmosphere is clearly high over the IGP and the Himalayan foothills (80–135 Wm−2 per unit aerosol optical depth (AOD)), with values being greater at higher elevations. AOD is >0.30 and single scattering albedo (SSA) is ∼0.90 throughout the year over this region. The mean ARFE is 2–4 times higher here than over other polluted sites in South and East Asia, owing to higher AOD and aerosol absorption (i.e., lower SSA). Further, the observed annual mean aerosol-induced atmospheric heating rates (0.5–0.8 Kelvin/day), which are significantly higher than previously reported values for the region, imply that the aerosols alone could account for >50 % of the total warming (aerosols + greenhouse gases) of the lower atmosphere and surface over this region. We demonstrate that the current state-of-the-art models used in climate assessments significantly underestimate aerosol-induced heating, efficiency and warming over the Hindu Kush – Himalaya – Tibetan Plateau (HKHTP) region, indicating a need for a more realistic representation of aerosol properties, especially of black carbon and other aerosols. The significant, regionally coherent aerosol-induced warming that we observe in the high altitudes of the region, is a significant factor contributing to increasing air temperature, observed accelerated retreat of the glaciers, and changes in the hydrological cycle and precipitation patterns over this region. Thus, aerosols are heating up the Himalayan climate, and will remain a key factor driving climate change over the region.","Himalayas,South Asia,Model simulations,Radiative effects,Atmospheric aerosols,Observations,"
"safeway: improving the safety of autonomous waypoint detection in maritime using transformer and interpolation","2023","Detecting waypoints where vessels change their behavior (i.e., maneuvers, speed changes, etc.) is essential for optimizing vessel trajectories to increase the efficiency and safety of sailing. However, accurately detecting waypoints is challenging due to potential AIS data quality issues (i.e., missing or inaccurate messages). In this paper, we propose a five-step learning approach (SafeWay) to estimate waypoints on a given AIS trajectory. First, we interpolate trajectories to tackle AIS data quality issues. Then, we annotate historical trajectories by using an existing waypoint library that contains historical waypoints. As the historical waypoints are passage plans manually created by port operators considering sailing conditions at that time, they are not specific to other historical trajectories between the same ports. We, therefore, use a similarity metric to determine overlapping segments of historical trajectories with the historical waypoints from the waypoint library. Then, we build a transformer model to capture vessel movement patterns based on speed- and location-related features. We do not process location features directly to avoid learning location-specific context, but take into account tailored delta features. We test our approach on a real-world AIS dataset collected from the Norwegian Sea between Å lesund and Måløy and show its effectiveness in terms of a harmonic mean of purity and coverage, mean absolute error and detection rate on the task of detecting trajectory waypoints compared to a state-of-the-art approach. We also show the effectiveness of the trained model on the trajectories obtained from two other regions, the North Sea (London and Rotterdam) and the North Atlantic Ocean (Setubal and Gibraltar), on which the model has not been trained. The experiments indicate that our interpolation-enabled transformer design provides improvements in the safety of the estimated waypoints.","Transformers,Maritime,Interpolation,Safety,Trajectory prediction,Vessel,Maneuver,Waypoint detection,Automatic identification system,AIS,"
"multi-label classification for ais data anomaly detection using wavelet transform","2022","Thanks to the Automatic Identification System (AIS), ships and other maritime equipment are able to communicate with each other, for example, by sending information about their position. This solution allows for early collision detection when two or more ships are on a collision course. In the newer version of AIS, a satellite infrastructure is used to extend the communication range. Unfortunately, satellite AIS deals with so-called packet collision effect: since there is a problem with synchronizing AIS data coming from multiple terrestrial areas, a single satellite may receive several AIS messages at the same time and be unable to correctly process them, causing the data to get lost or garbled. In this article, a machine learning based framework for detecting the incorrect AIS data is presented. In this approach, after the first stage (clustering), a dedicated anomaly detection algorithm searches for damaged AIS messages and conducts multi-label classification (with Random Forest and wavelet transform) to decide which fields of such message requires further correction.

"a story about estimation of a random field of boulders from incomplete seismic measurements","2005","This paper reports on the statistical interpretation of seismic diffraction measurements of boulder locations. The measurements are made in a corridor along the planned tunnel line for the later realized bored tunnel through the till deposits under the East Channel of the Great Belt in Denmark. The investigation was made in 1987–1988 on the initiative of A/S Storebæltsforbindelsen in order to prepare its tendering for the bored tunnel. The purpose was to make a prediction of the density of boulders of maximal dimension above any specified length. The properties of the seismic measuring device and its graphical registrations on seismograms do not make a proper interpretation possible without detailed knowledge about the joint distribution of the primary dimensions of the boulders. Therefore, separate measurements were made of the dimensions of boulders deposited visibly on the cliff beaches of the Great Belt. The surprisingly simple results from the analysis of the data from this separate measuring program are reported in a companion paper. Based on the revealed geographical universality of the joint dimension distribution it is anticipated that the same distribution is applicable for the till deposits along the tunnel line. By use of this important distribution information and of the observed homogeneity of the seismic point source field together with the physical properties of diffraction it became possible to make the wanted prediction. During the excavation, the found boulders were counted and measured. These direct observations on site confirmed that the prediction was quite good.","Probabilistic models,Field investigations,Predictions,Statistical inference,Diffraction,Glacier till,Boulders,Tunnel boring,Seismic surveys,"
"integrated ship monitoring system for realtime maritime surveillance","2016","The paper introduces an integrated ship monitoring system, which has been designed and developed with the purpose of real-time maritime surveillance. The integrated system now provides ship information such as position, flag, type etc. over maritime in real-time through the automatic download, processing and visualization steps of data collected from terrestrial-and satellite-based automatic identification systems (AIS) and Sentinel-1. The collected AIS and FMCW radar data are the main source for the real-time remote maritime surveillance, and the SAR-based automatic ship detection system is operated as a SAR mode to integrate the past data because of a time delay in the Sentinel-1 acquisition. The radar and land-based AIS were installed at an ocean tower off the west coast of South Korea. This system will support a rapid and effective surveillance over a huge oceanic area.","Satellites,marine radar,ocean tower,Sentinel-1,radar detection,real-time,Marine vehicles,ship monitoring,CW radar,remote maritime surveillance,South Korea,ships,AIS,Oceans,Integrated system,search radar,FMCW radar data,Artificial intelligence,Real-time systems,integrated ship monitoring system,SAR based automatic ship detection system,automatic identification systems,Surveillance,FM radar,"
"gross and microscopic pathology of lesions in pocillopora spp. from the subtropical eastern pacific","2014","Coral reefs are threatened by a variety of factors including diseases that have caused significant damage in some regions such as in the Caribbean. At present, no data are available on coral diseases in the Mexican Pacific where Pocillopora spp. is a dominant component of coral communities. Here, we describe gross and microscopic morphology of lesions found in pocilloporids at four sites in the Mexican Pacific. Corals were identified and their lesions photographed and quantified in the field. Tissue samples were collected from healthy and affected colonies for histopathology. We recorded seven species of pocilloporids at the study sites with Isla Isabel being the location with the highest coral diversity (H′=1.27). Lesions were present in 42% of the colonies and included discoloration (32%), predation-induced tissue loss (30%), unexplained tissue loss (3%) and overgrowth by sponges or algae (35%). The most affected species, P. damicornis (50%), was also one of the most common in the region. No species was more prone to a particular lesion, but there was a significant association between location and the presence of lesions. Northern Islas Marietas (61%) and Isla Isabel (41%) had the highest prevalence of lesions, followed by Manzanillo (37%) and Bahías de Huatulco (23%). Histological changes included atrophy of the surface body wall with depletion of zooxanthellae (91%) in corals with discoloration (bleaching). Ablation of tissue from mesoglea (18%) was also observed. Colonies with unexplained tissue loss showed atrophy and thinning of the epidermis (89%), characterized by cuboidal instead of pseudocolumnar cells normally found in healthy pseudocolumnar ciliated epithelium. Bacterial aggregates between the mesoglea and gastrodermis (11%) were very conspicuous in healthy and diseased corals. Lesions produced by fish bites and gastropods were associated with tissue atrophy (40%) and, in some cases, algal overgrowth near the lesion (20%). No infectious agents associated with cell pathology were detected microscopically. Bleaching and overgrowth by algae and sponges, as well as unexplained tissue loss, are common in Pocillopora. These lesions and anatomical changes warrant further study since their incidence is potentially indicative of reef degradation.","Histopathology,Eastern Pacific,Lesions,Coral diseases,"
"26 - applications of ai and possibilities for process control","2022","Multiphase flows occur in the oil and gas industries, e.g., gas/oil/water/sand (g/o/w/s) in all possible combinations, drilling mud with cuttings and g/o/w/s, in the storage and transport of wet or dry particulates, e.g., fluidized beds, slurries and sedimentation, e.g., as in dredging, in the nuclear power industries, e.g., entrained air, and steam at supercritical temperatures in cooling water in pressurized water reactors. Most of these processes have different flow regimes with varying distributions of the different materials/phases, flowing at different speeds and spread over the cross-section of the conduit supporting the flow, an important topic in CFD studies and software development. These processes are monitored with a plethora of sensors, continuously gathering vast amount of valuable data from various locations with many control loops distributed in the processes with a dedicated overall process control using different strategies, which recently have AI and machine learning techniques in their portfolio. The data from the sensors are valuable in data fusion not only for deterministic mechanistic modeling but also for exploratory data analysis (EDA), a growing branch of AI-based industrial machine learning. Data from process tomography/tomometry using nonintrusive and noninvasive sensing provide big data in real time, useful in identifying various flow phenomena, such as flow regimes, tunneling flow in silos, infiltration of sand in pipes, unusually high presence of gas bubbles in cooling water, etc. In this chapter, some applications of ECT and EIT in the above three process industries are presented. This chapter focuses on the sensor arrays and protocols used along with excitation and sensing methods used in the ECT/EIT modules and then presents some results from EDA as applied in the growing field of industrial machine learning. In all the three branches of process industries mentioned above, interesting results are presented showing possibilities of flow regime identification based on the distribution of the phases involved with the possibilities of integrating ECT/EIT in model free adaptive control of these processes.","Fluidized bed column (FBC),Neural networks,Multiphase flow,Process safety,Sensor data fusion,Process industries,Electrical capacitance/impedance tomography (ECT/EIT),Process tomography,Flow regime,Model free adaptive control (MFAC),Pressurized water reactors,Machine learning,"
"impact of past mining activities on water quality in a karst area in the cévennes region, southern france","2023","Sampling and analysis of groundwater and surface water were conducted to assess the potential impacts of abandoned mines on water quality in a karst area in Southern France. The results of multivariate statistical analysis and geochemical mapping revealed that water quality is affected by contaminated drainage from abandoned mine sites. Acid mine drainage with very high concentrations of Fe, Mn, Al, Pb and Zn was identified in a few samples collected from mine openings and near waste dumps. In general, neutral drainage with elevated concentrations of Fe, Mn, Zn, As, Ni and Cd was observed due to buffering by carbonate dissolution. The contamination is spatially limited around abandoned mine sites, suggesting that metal(oid)s are sequestered in secondary phases that form under near-neutral and oxidizing conditions. However, the analysis of seasonal variations in trace metal concentrations showed that the transport of metal contaminants in water is highly variable according to hydrological conditions. During low flow conditions, trace metals are likely to be rapidly sequestered in Fe-oxyhydroxides and carbonate minerals in the karst aquifer and the river sediments, while low or no surface runoff in intermittent rivers limits the transport of contaminants in the environment. On the other hand, significant amounts of metal(loid)s can be transported under high flow conditions, primarily in dissolved form. Dissolved metal(loid) concentrations in groundwater remained elevated despite dilution by uncontaminated water, likely as a result of the increased leaching of mine wastes and the flushing of contaminated waters from mine workings. This work shows that groundwater is the main source of contamination to the environment and highlights the need to better understand the fate of trace metals in karst water systems.","Compositional data analysis,Seasonal variations,Groundwater,Trace metals,Croix-de-Pallières,Mine drainage,"
"coordination control strategy of mav/uav based on route detection for maritime target","2020","Aiming at tactics demand of coordination operation of MAV/UAV formation for maritime target, a coordination control strategy of MAV/UAV based on route detection was proposed, which could satisfy requirements of attack position, entering angle and launching opportunity of MAV/UAV formation.

"a wavelet-based deep learning pipeline for efficient covid-19 diagnosis via ct slices","2022","The quick diagnosis of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) disease is vital to prevent its propagation and improve therapeutic outcomes. Computed tomography (CT) is believed to be an effective tool for diagnosing COVID-19, however, the CT scan contains hundreds of slices that are complex to be analyzed and could cause delays in diagnosis. Artificial intelligence (AI) especially deep learning (DL), could facilitate and speed up COVID-19 diagnosis from such scans. Several studies employed DL approaches based on 2D CT images from a single view, nevertheless, 3D multiview CT slices demonstrated an excellent ability to enhance the efficiency of COVID-19 diagnosis. The majority of DL-based studies utilized the spatial information of the original CT images to train their models, though, using spectral–temporal information could improve the detection of COVID-19. This article proposes a DL-based pipeline called CoviWavNet for the automatic diagnosis of COVID-19. CoviWavNet uses a 3D multiview dataset called OMNIAHCOV. Initially, it analyzes the CT slices using multilevel discrete wavelet decomposition (DWT) and then uses the heatmaps of the approximation levels to train three ResNet CNN models. These ResNets use the spectral–temporal information of such images to perform classification. Subsequently, it investigates whether the combination of spatial information with spectral–temporal information could improve the diagnostic accuracy of COVID-19. For this purpose, it extracts deep spectral–temporal features from such ResNets using transfer learning and integrates them with deep spatial features extracted from the same ResNets trained with the original CT slices. Then, it utilizes a feature selection step to reduce the dimension of such integrated features and use them as inputs to three support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. To further validate the performance of CoviWavNet, a publicly available benchmark dataset called SARS-COV-2-CT-Scan is employed. The results of CoviWavNet have demonstrated that using the spectral–temporal information of the DWT heatmap images to train the ResNets is superior to utilizing the spatial information of the original CT images. Furthermore, integrating deep spectral–temporal features with deep spatial features has enhanced the classification accuracy of the three SVM classifiers reaching a final accuracy of 99.33% and 99.7% for the OMNIAHCOV and SARS-COV-2-CT-Scan datasets respectively. These accuracies verify the outstanding performance of CoviWavNet compared to other related studies. Thus, CoviWavNet can help radiologists in the rapid and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 diagnosis.","Convolutional neural networks,Discrete wavelet transform (DWT),Deep learning,Computed tomography (CT),COVID-19,ResNet,"
"distributed adaptive time slot allocation for wimax based maritime wireless mesh networks","2009","We envisage extending radio coverage of the existing terrestrial wireless broadband networks to the sea to provide ships with cost-efficient high-speed connection to the Internet. This is achieved by forming a WiMAX based maritime wireless mesh network where ships are network nodes connected to the land station across multiple hops. In such a maritime wireless mesh network, time slot allocation is an important issue as it affects the performance in terms of throughout and delay. This papers proposes a distributed adaptive time slot allocation (DATSA) scheme for WiMAX mesh MAC protocol. DATSA is a distributed scheme that allocates time slots robustly by taking into consideration difference between radio reception range and interference range, and latency in scheduling control messages. DATSA has a method to monitor reception quality of an allocated time slot, in order to detect the effect of topology changes due to ship mobility, etc. Based on the monitoring outcome, the method adaptively changes the time slot allocation if necessary. We have evaluated DATSA through random event simulation using QualNet. The simulation results confirm that DATSA outperforms the original WiMAX mesh MAC protocol that has no adaptive time slot allocation, in terms of throughput, average packet delay, and packet delivery ratio.","WiMAX mesh MAC protocol,terrestrial wireless broadband network,Robust control,Wireless mesh networks,Marine vehicles,Monitoring,distributed adaptive time slot allocation,radio reception range,IP networks,interference range,maritime wireless mesh network,ship mobility,access protocols,telecommunication network topology,Delay effects,Media Access Protocol,Broadband communication,radiofrequency interference,broadband networks,radio reception,marine communication,WiMAX,Interference,Internet,WiMax,"
