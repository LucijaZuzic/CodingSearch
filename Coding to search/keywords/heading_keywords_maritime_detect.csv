"enhancing global maritime domain awareness through sar with multiple apertures","2014","This paper investigates and demonstrates enhancements to Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) through the use of a multi-aperture space-based SAR. In contrast to a single channel SAR, it shows how modes can be designed to collect data over a wide swath (enabling wide area surveillance) at high resolution (offering improved vessel detectability and potential for classification). This paper also explores how these same data can be processed using different algorithms to enhance ship detection through clutter suppression and outlines how to estimate vessel headings and speeds. Additionally, it shows that in littoral zones, ambiguities from on-shore clutter can be minimized. Demonstrations of the claims are made using data collected by RADARSAT-2 in a dual-aperture configuration.","vessel heading estimation,ship detection enhancement,multiaperture space-based SAR,RADARSAT-2 dual-aperture configuration,radar detection,radar clutter,Marine vehicles,vessel speed estimation,Synthetic aperture radar,interference suppression,data collection,littoral zone,synthetic aperture radar,MDA,single chan- nel SAR,wide area surveillance,Azimuth,Apertures,spaceborne radar,on-shore clutter suppression,improved vessel detectability,global maritime domain awareness enhancement,improved vessel classification,Estimation,Arrays,oceanographic techniques,"
"a spatiotemporal clustering approach to maritime domain awareness","2013","Spatiotemporal clustering is the process of grouping objects based on both their spatial and temporal similarity. This approach is useful when considering the distance between objects and how that distance changes through time. Spatiotemporal clustering analysis is applied to the maritime domain in this paper, specifically to a defined area of water, during a period of time, in order to gain behavioral knowledge of vessel interactions and provide the opportunity to screen such interactions for further investigation. The proposed spatiotemporal clustering algorithm spatially clusters vessels in the water space using k-means clustering analysis, kinematically refines the clusters based on the similarity of vessel headings, speeds and the distance between them, and temporally analyzes the continuity of membership of the kinematic clusters through time to determine which clusters are moving. The algorithm is implemented in the MATLAB programming environment, verified with a synthetic data scenario, and validated with two real-world datasets.","Kinematics,spatiotemporal clustering algorithm,Clustering algorithms,Spatiotemporal phenomena,Spatiotemporal clustering,maritime domain awareness,Global Positioning System,MATLAB programming,Filtering,marine safety,maritime domain,vessel headings,vessel interaction,water space,marine communication,Visualization,Algorithm design and analysis,k-means clustering analysis,vessel speeds,Arrays,"
"maritime anomaly detection in ferry tracks","2017","This paper proposes a methodology for the automatic detection of anomalous shipping tracks traced by ferries. The approach comprises a set of models as a basis for outlier detection: A Gaussian process (GP) model regresses displacement information collected over time, and a Markov chain based detector makes use of the direction (heading) information. GP regression is performed together with Median Absolute Deviation to account for contaminated training data. The methodology utilizes the coordinates of a given ferry recorded on a second by second basis via Automatic Identification System. Its effectiveness is demonstrated on a dataset collected in the Solent area.","Markov processes,automatic anomalous shipping track detection,Hidden Markov models,unsupervised learning,Marine vehicles,Anomaly Detection,ferry tracks,Markov chain based detector,marine navigation,Gaussian Processes,heading information,displacement information regression,regression analysis,outlier detection,data analysis,Median Absolute Deviation,object tracking,ships,ferry coordinates,automatic identification system,direction information,Training data,Gaussian processes,traffic information systems,Artificial intelligence,median absolute deviation,maritime anomaly detection,Solent area,Maritime Traffic,Gaussian process model,Detectors,"
"a distance-based trajectory outlier detection method on maritime traffic data","2018","As a result of establishment of Automatic Identification System (AIS) networks, maritime vessel trajectories are becoming increasingly available. Finding outliers in a collection of patterns among AIS trajectories is critical for real time applications ranging from military surveillance to transportation management. In this paper we present a distance-based approach for trajectory outlier detection on trajectory data. First, we apply Density Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) to generate patterns from original trajectories. Second, we extract gravity vectors and sample stop points from clusters to retain stop and move information and to reduce the further computation cost. To measure the similarity between trajectory points and clusters, cluster relative distance and cluster angular distance are proposed. Finally, we present experiments on real AIS data at Chinese QiongZhou strait. The experiment results show that our methods can detect distance anomaly and speed/heading anomaly effectively and greatly reduces computation cost.","data mining,Clustering algorithms,maritime traffic data,Anomaly detection,trajectory data,AIS networks,Chinese QiongZhou strait,speed anomaly detection,cluster,trajectory points,density based spatial clustering of applications with noise,outlier detection,cluster relative distance,DBSCAN,Gravity,marine safety,marine engineering,computation cost,AIS,Data models,cluster angular distance,trajectory data mining,distance anomaly,trajectory outlier detection,gravity vectors,AIS trajectories,pattern clustering,Artificial intelligence,distance-based approach,distance-based trajectory outlier detection method,maritime vessel trajectories,heading anomaly detection,Trajectory,traffic engineering computing,stop points,automatic identification system networks,AIS data,"
