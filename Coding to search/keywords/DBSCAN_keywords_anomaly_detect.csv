"abnormal moving speed detection using combination of kernel density estimator and dbscan for coastal surveillance radars","2020","In this paper, we investigate the problem of detection of abnormal moving speeds for a coastal surveillance radar. A new definition of normal moving speeds which is based on the historical radar data of maritime targets on the monitoring area is introduced. The historical radar data is mined by the cell-based method, unsupervised machine learning to obtain the vessel normal moving speeds in the monitoring area. Then a logic rule is applied to detect the abnormal targets. The proposed method is tested with real data from a coastal surveillance radar. The test results show that the false alarm rate (FAR) is equal zero. It is also shown that this kind of anomaly detection can be integrated into a coastal surveillance radar for the detection of the maritime illegal activities.","data mining,coastal surveillance radar,vessel normal moving speeds,Kernel,marine radar,unsupervised machine learning,radar detection,Kernel Density Estimator,unsupervised learning,maritime illegal activities,anomaly detection,false alarm rate,Sea measurements,Abnormal Moving Speed,DBSCAN,radar computing,cell-based method,abnormal targets,Maritime Anomaly Detection,maritime targets,search radar,Radar,radar signal processing,abnormal moving speed detection,Surveillance,learning (artificial intelligence),Radar signal processing,monitoring area,historical radar data,Radar detection,"
"varying-scale hca-dbscan-based anomaly detection method for multi-dimensional energy data in steel industry","2023","The quality of the acquisition data in the energy system of steel industry is the basis of prediction analysis and scheduling operation. Facing with its multi-dimensional and high-noise characteristics, in this study, an anomaly detection method based on a varying-scale hypercube accelerated density based spatial clustering for applications with noise (VHCA-DBSCAN) is proposed. An HCA-DBSCAN model based on the Gaussian probability density estimation is firstly established, in which the searching radius is adaptively calculated to identify the suspected outliers efficiently. Then, a traversal search strategy for hypercube segmentation is designed, where the lengths of the edges are varying according to the characteristics of each dimension. Finally, a modified local outlier factor (LOF) by using the approximate upper boundary is presented to evaluate the degree of the suspected outliers, and the confirmed ones are identified by collaboratively considering the manufacturing signals. Validation experiments by employing real-world data from a typical steel enterprise are carried out, and the results indicate that the proposed method exhibits reliable performance and high efficiency when facing with the anomaly detection problem of multi-dimensional industrial data.","Anomaly detection,Varying-scale HCA-DBSCAN,Multi-dimensional energy data,Steel industry,"
"maritime vessel route extraction and automatic information system (ais) spoofing detection","2021","Automated Identification System (AIS) comprises of a global real-time network of maritime vessels, transmitters, and satellite or ground-station receivers, which are used to track and record time-stamped static (vessel-id, type, etc.) and dynamic (location, course, speed, etc.) information of all maritime vessels. Traditionally, this data feed has been used by vessel traffic services to avoid vessel collisions, however increasingly, marine researchers and data scientists have shown interest in developing algorithms on historical AIS data-dumps with diverse objectives such as estimating trends in global ocean-currents, maritime logistical planning, fishing fleet monitoring and enhancing maritime security. This paper aims to propose a novel shipping-route extraction algorithm to process historical AIS data (running into tens of gigabytes of daily data, from more than a hundred thousand maritime vessels), to effectively characterize global shipping route behaviour and capture its seasonal trends. This is done by formulating a sigmoid based turning waypoint identification, which does not solely depend on the change in the course of a vessel, derived from AIS message. The AIS data is further processed to excerpt the vesselâ€™s distance from the nearest port and nearest shore with resolution of about 1 km, which forms a handy metric for the identification of suspicious ports. Several other use cases are also explored, which include detecting various anomalies in individual vessel behaviour such as intentional or unintentional switching off AIS transmission, shipping-lane deviations, spoofing transmission messages. To tackle spoofing anomaly, various spoofing identification methods are discussed. A region-based spoofing identification algorithm is developed to identify spoofing points under multiple categories using a clustering algorithm. All the results are visualized through an open-source map overlay. The results contribute to a growing body of fast shipping route analysis algorithms.","Pattern recognition,fleet monitoring,Clustering algorithms,size 1.0 km,Folium,AIS transmission,ground-station receivers,historical AIS data-dumps,maritime vessels,Switches,security of data,maritime security,vessel behaviour,maritime logistical planning,Transmitters,global shipping route behaviour,Turning,logistics,ships,marine safety,Route Extraction,marine engineering,nearest port,Automatic Identification system,Port catalogue,vessel traffic services,automatic information system spoofing detection,Data Mining,shipping-route extraction algorithm,vessel collisions,Artificial intelligence,AIS message,maritime vessel route extraction,time-stamped static,data scientists,spoofing identification methods,AIS spoofing detection,Market research,DBSCAN Clustering Algorithm,fast shipping route analysis algorithms,Data mining,global ocean-currents,Python,nearest shore,marine researchers,"
"unsupervised maritime traffic graph learning with mean-reverting stochastic processes","2018","Inspired by the fair regularity of the motion of ships, we present a method to derive a representation of the commercial maritime traffic in the form of a graph, whose nodes represent way-point areas, or regions of likely direction changes, and whose edges represent navigational legs with constant cruise velocity. The proposed method is based on the representation of a ship's velocity with an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process and on the detection of changes of its long-run mean to identify navigational way-points. In order to assess the graph representativeness of the traffic, two performance metrics are introduced, leading to distinct graph construction criteria. Finally, the proposed method is validated against real-world Automatic Identification System data collected in a large area.","real-world data,Clustering algorithms,Anomaly detection,unsupervised learning,graph construction criteria,Marine vehicles,mean-reverting stochastic processes,unsupervised maritime traffic graph learning,Stochastic processes,maritime situational awareness,DBSCAN,Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process,change detection,ships,automatic identification system,stochastic processes,motion control,AIS,navigational legs,maritime traffic graph,Artificial intelligence,velocity control,graph theory,constant cruise velocity,Legged locomotion,clustering,graph representativeness,Navigation,navigation,graph learning,navigational way-points,ship velocity,"

"a novel hybrid approach for detecting abnormal vessel behavior in maritime traffic","2023","The Abnormal Behavior Detection of Vessels (ABVD) is crucial for enhancing Vesselsâ€™ situational awareness as well as achieving effective management of maritime traffic. Clustering algorithms are extensively employed for ABVD tasks, however, they are not only time-consuming but also frequently inaccurate when dealing with complex and dynamic vessel trajectory detection tasks. To address the above problems, we propose a novel hybrid approach, CSDLSTM(Course/Speed-DBSCAN and LSTM), which combines Density-based Clustering(DBSCAN) and long short-term memory networks to improve the efficiency of ABVD. Specifically, a three-dimensional CS-DBSCAN (Course/Speed-DBSCAN) algorithm is proposed, which incorporates speed and course features along with geospatial information in the clustering process to accurately describe vessel behavior. In addition, the clustering results are used as traffic patterns to train the LSTM predictor for real-time maritime anomaly detection. Experiments conducted on real AIS datasets demonstrate that the CSD-LSTM method has greater precision and efficiency in ABVD.","Traffic control,Transportation,Clustering algorithms,LSTM,Prediction algorithms,CS-DBSCAN,Sensitivity,Real-time systems,Heuristic algorithms,abnormal vessel behavior,"
"a distance-based trajectory outlier detection method on maritime traffic data","2018","As a result of establishment of Automatic Identification System (AIS) networks, maritime vessel trajectories are becoming increasingly available. Finding outliers in a collection of patterns among AIS trajectories is critical for real time applications ranging from military surveillance to transportation management. In this paper we present a distance-based approach for trajectory outlier detection on trajectory data. First, we apply Density Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) to generate patterns from original trajectories. Second, we extract gravity vectors and sample stop points from clusters to retain stop and move information and to reduce the further computation cost. To measure the similarity between trajectory points and clusters, cluster relative distance and cluster angular distance are proposed. Finally, we present experiments on real AIS data at Chinese QiongZhou strait. The experiment results show that our methods can detect distance anomaly and speed/heading anomaly effectively and greatly reduces computation cost.","data mining,Clustering algorithms,maritime traffic data,Anomaly detection,trajectory data,AIS networks,Chinese QiongZhou strait,speed anomaly detection,cluster,trajectory points,density based spatial clustering of applications with noise,outlier detection,cluster relative distance,DBSCAN,Gravity,marine safety,marine engineering,computation cost,AIS,Data models,cluster angular distance,trajectory data mining,distance anomaly,trajectory outlier detection,gravity vectors,AIS trajectories,pattern clustering,Artificial intelligence,distance-based approach,distance-based trajectory outlier detection method,maritime vessel trajectories,heading anomaly detection,Trajectory,traffic engineering computing,stop points,automatic identification system networks,AIS data,"
"clustering of maritime trajectories with ais features for context learning","2021","This paper presents an analysis on Automatic Identification System (AIS) real world ship data to build a system with the capability to extract useful information for an anomaly detection problem. The study focuses on the adjustment of a clustering technique to trajectory data, specifically using a DBSCAN algorithm that is adapted by means of two approaches. On the one hand, the DTW trajectory similarity metric is used to obtain a distance between two trajectories. On the other hand, an extraction of features of interest from each trajectory allowing a summary of the trajectory in a single multidimensional instance. The results show that both approaches are feasible, although not very scalable to larger problems due to the computational complexity of the used algorithms. In addition, the study analyses possible uses of these approaches to existing data mining problems.","data mining,Clustering algorithms,anomaly detection problem,trajectory data,Marine vehicles,Conferences,Feature extraction,information retrieval,AIS feature extraction,information extraction,AIS real world ship data,single multidimensional instance,DTW trajectory similarity metric,pattern clustering,Artificial intelligence,Measurement,marine engineering computing,automatic identification system real world ship data,Context learning,DBSCAN algorithm,Trajectory,computational complexity,maritime trajectory clustering,context learning,Data mining,learning (artificial intelligence),AIS data,Trajectory clustering,"
