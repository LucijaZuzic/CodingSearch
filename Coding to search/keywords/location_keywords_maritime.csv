"function-shape-based particle swarm optimization and its application in maritime static target cooperative search","2017","The application of particle swarm algorithm in optimization has been growing over the last few years, but this approach becomes computationally impracticable when the complexity of the problem increases. In this context, an improvement of the particle swarm algorithm-the function-shape-based particle swarm optimization (FSPSO) is presented. For a practical maritime cooperative search problem, FSPSO makes particles move around in the corresponding solution space according to certain rules to gather information firstly. Then FSPSO exploits the history data acquired during the first process to analyze the shape of the solution space. Based on the knowledge about the function shape, FSPSO generates solutions and iteration strategies. At last, the position and speed of each particle will be updated iteratively, aiming at producing a high quality solution to the optimization problem. The main idea behind FSPSO is to hybridize PSO with the search mode of a human being. This paper uses maritime static target cooperative search as a test domain. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of FSPSO, we perform a comparison between the performances of FSPSO with other approaches drawn from the scientific literature. Results demonstrate that FSPSO is able to produce statistically significantly higher quality solutions, outperforming many other approaches.","Decoding,Generators,history data,heuristics,information theory,particle swarm optimisation,Software packages,particle swarm optimization,maritime search,Multiplexing,iteration strategies,practical maritime cooperative search problem,Complexity theory,search problems,function shape,maritime static target cooperative search,FSPSO,function-shape,Algorithm design and analysis,cooperative,particle swarm algorithm-the,Field programmable gate arrays,"
"motion modeling and simulation of maritime autonomous surface ships in realistic environmental disturbances","2020","A novel modeling and simulation pipeline is proposed in this paper to predict the six-degrees-of-freedom (6-DOF) motion of MASS under realistic environmental disturbances. The MASS model consists of several physics-based differential equations that are built based on state-of-the-art studies. The onboard sensors are utilized to drive the MASS model to keep the consistent control input with the real ships. A build-in hydrodynamic database describes the motion characteristics of ships. Moreover, an actual sea database is developed based on the third-generation wave numerical model to reproduce the ocean characteristics in the simulation. The spatial-and time-varying environmental vector fields are obtained from the real sea database to ensure consistency with the real environment. Three real voyage cases are reproduced by the presented method. The simulation results are compared with the records from onboard sensors for validation. The RMSE of the simulated trajectories is 3.789', 3.110', and 1.318' under the single influence of disturbances due to the inappropriate description of the real sea. Under the coupling disturbances, the RMSE of trajectories reduces to 0.1829', 0.5249', and 0.4030'. Consequently, the results indicate that the ocean database accurately reflected the ocean characteristics realistically, and the presented method can effectively predict the motions of the real ship under the actual sea environmental disturbances.","onboard sensors,control system synthesis,state-of-the-art studies,third-generation wave numerical model,remotely operated vehicles,maritime autonomous surface ships,Marine vehicles,ship,Mathematical model,coupling disturbances,simulated trajectories,spatial- time-varying environmental vector fields,Predictive models,realistic environmental disturbances,ships,differential equations,hydrodynamic database,hydrodynamics,motion control,Databases,Oceans,position control,ocean database,motion modeling,motion characteristics,actual sea environmental disturbances,physics-based differential equations,Hydrodynamics,Numerical models,time series,six-degrees-of-freedom,actual sea database,mobile robots,MASS model,marine control,numerical analysis,consistent control input,ocean characteristics,"
"maritime anomaly detection in a real-world scenario: ever given grounding in the suez canal","2022","In this paper we present how automatic maritime anomaly detection tools can be successfully applied in real-world situations such as the major event of the container vessel Ever Given, which grounded in the Suez Canal on March 23rd 2021. The anomaly detector is designed to process the available sequence of Automatic Identification System (AIS) reports, information from ground-based or satellite radar systems if available, and contextual information defining the expected nominal behavior of navigation. A statistical hypothesis testing procedure is sequentially run to decide whether or not a deviation from the nominal behavior happened within a specific time period, for instance two consecutive data points. We show, based on the recorded AIS data from the Ever Given, that the proposed detector could have been triggered and alerted to anomalous behavior fully 19 minutes before the grounding.","anomaly detector,Anomaly detection,Marine vehicles,Grounding,statistical hypothesis testing,Ever Given grounding,automatic maritime anomaly detection tools,statistical analysis,Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process,Testing,ships,Containers,automatic identification system,radar,maritime surveillance,satellite radar systems,contextual information,container vessel,Suez Canal,Artificial intelligence,ground-based system,marine engineering computing,Maritime anomaly detection,Irrigation,statistical hypothesis testing procedure,expected nominal behavior,AIS data,"
"optimal maneuvering and control of cooperative vehicles as case study for maritime applications within harbors","2019","This paper presents the development of a networked control system for maritime applications within the joint project GALILEOnautic to enable autonomous shipping and optimal maneuvering in harbor environments. To achieve this objective, all networked vehicles estimate position, velocity, orientation and time dynamically using a maritime navigation filter. These vehicle states are broadcasted to a central computation unit via long term evolution (LTE) mobile communication in combination with virtual private network (VPN). After a data synchronization step, an optimization algorithm uses the vessel states to calculate model-based optimal trajectories for each networked participant. These trajectories consist of target positions at certain instants of time and optimal settings for the rudder and propulsion units which are used as feedforward variables for a local trajectory controller on each vessel. To compensate smaller errors due to model inaccuracies during trajectory calculation, a feedback control loop is also established. Beside active network participants, other vehicles can be considered as well using data which is broadcasted by the automatic identification system (AIS). This paper presents the promising results of GALILEOnautic demonstrating an encounter situation of two networked vessels and one disturbing, non-networked participant. To demonstrate how the approach is able to avoid critical situations, three different demonstrators with increasing complexity are shown: networked robots, unmanned surface vehicles, and a ship-handling simulator.","model inaccuracies,feedback,target positions,trajectory calculation,remotely operated vehicles,maritime navigation filter,model-based optimal trajectories,optimization algorithm,optimal control,LTE,harbor environments,VPN,local trajectory controller,feedback control loop,nonnetworked participant,ships,automatic identification system,autonomous shipping,networked vessels,central computation unit,feedforward,networked control system,virtual private network,AIS,optimisation,position control,rudder,data synchronization step,networked vehicles,networked robots,virtual private networks,maritime applications,networked participant,vehicle states,vessel states,active network participants,optimal maneuvering,trajectory control,unmanned surface vehicles,mobile robots,optimal settings,navigation,marine vehicles,collision avoidance,Long Term Evolution,propulsion units,joint project GALILEOnautic,long term evolution mobile communication,"
"a semi-supervised deep learning approach for vessel trajectory classification based on ais data","2022","Automatic identification system (AIS) refers to a new type of navigation aid system equipped in maritime vehicles to monitor ship performance. It provides trajectory information of vessels which can be used for the classification task. The classification results facilitate ocean surveillance and conservation, vessel management enhancement, fishery regulation, marine ecological sustainability, and nautical safety protection. Some progresses have been made based on machine learning or deep learning strategies to perform supervised learning by assuming that during the training process, the category labels of historical trajectory data are available. However, in reality, the label information may be difficult or expensive to obtain, resulting in that only a small part of the training data is labeled, and most of the training data is unlabeled. To address this issue, this paper proposes a semi-supervised deep learning approach to integrate the knowledge of unlabeled data for vessel trajectory classification. Here, we call our approach SSL-VTC. Specifically, we first extract vessel trajectories by integrating the kinematic and static information from historical AIS messages. Then, we design convolutional neural networks to extract feature representations from the vessel trajectories. Finally, we develop a semi-supervised learning algorithm based on the variational autoencoder to perform discriminative learning and generative learning simultaneously. In this way, our SSL-VTC framework can fully leverage the labeled data and unlabeled data during the training process. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to utilize semi-supervised learning for vessel trajectory classification. Experimental results on the public AIS dataset show that our SSL-VTC can effectively extract feature representations from the AIS messages and its performance is significantly better than the traditional supervised learning methods. The approach and findings of this study provide important implications for researchers and stakeholders in the field of ocean management.","Vessel trajectory classification,Variational autoencoder,Deep learning,Semi-supervised learning,Automatic identification system,"
"intensified aridity over the indo-pacific warm pool controlled by ice-sheet expansion during the last glacial maximum","2022","The magnitude, direction and cause of precipitation changes across the Indo-Pacific Warm Pool (IPWP) during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) remain elusive. In particular, it is still inconclusive whether tropical or extra-tropical factors controlled such precipitation changes. Determining the spatio-temporal distribution of precipitation in the IPWP during the LGM is a valid strategy to address this issue, but the existing precipitation records are dominantly from maritime continents and marginal seas, with few data from pelagic oceans. In order to fill this gap, we analyzed the oxygen isotopic compositions of single Ethmodiscus rex diatom frustules (δ18OE. rex) from a sediment core (WPD-03) consisting of laminated diatom mats (LDMs) in the eastern Philippine Sea (EPS). δ18OE. rex was controlled mainly by sea-surface salinity variation and, thus, can reflect open-ocean precipitation changes across the IPWP. Our precipitation proxy records, in combination with existing published data, reveal spatial patterns of precipitation change that indicate overall drying across the IPWP during the LGM. Based on a comparison of paleoclimatic records with modeling results, we propose that extra-tropical factors (ice-sheet size) controlled precipitation variability in the IPWP during the LGM through a combination of zonal shifts of ENSO and meridional migration of the ITCZ. Strong aridity during the LGM prevented formation of a subsurface barrier layer and, hence, allowed accessing of sufficient nutrients to surface waters, stimulating blooms of E. rex and subsequent formation of LDMs in the IPWP. These findings suggest an important role for high-latitude climate in the tropical hydrological cycle during the LGM.","Tropical West Pacific,Diatom blooms,Sea-surface salinity,Model simulation,Tropical hydroclimate,High-latitude forcing,"
"fusion detection algorithm of maritime radar and electro-optical pod for complex sea conditions","2023","In order to improve the perceptual capability of Unmanned Surface Vessels (USVs) in complex sea conditions, a fusion detection algorithm has been developed that combines maritime radar and electro-optical (EO) pod. This algorithm integrates the positional state of the USV, class information of the maritime target obtained through a vision-based target detection algorithm, and processed maritime radar information. By using Gaussian and morphological filtering, the fusion of position state information from the USV, EO pod data, and maritime radar data is achieved. This effectively mitigates the negative impact of environmental factors, such as waves and water mist, on target detection. A cooperative sensing process between the maritime radar and EO pod is proposed to fuse the data obtained from both sources, resulting in accurate comprehensive target information. Experimental results show that the fusion algorithm achieves an average accuracy of 80.24% and a detection rate of 74.7%, enabling precise detection of maritime targets, including their distance, speed, and category. This enhanced perceptual capability is essential for USVs operating in complex maritime environments, enabling better decision-making and navigation performance.","maritime radar data,class information,accurate comprehensive target information,sensor fusion,marine radar,electro-optical pod,vision-based target detection algorithm,fusion algorithm,enhanced perceptual capability,target detection,complex maritime environments,positional state,combines maritime radar,fusion detection algorithm,object detection,complex sea conditions,Collaboration,synergistic sensing,Surface morphology,Radar,position state information,Unmanned Surface Vessels,unmanned surface vehicles,detection rate,maritime radar information,Radar imaging,USVs operating,Object detection,Signal processing algorithms,EO pod,maritime target,multi-sensor fusion,Radar detection,"
"maritime situational awareness forensics tools for a common information sharing environment (cise)","2019","CISE stands for Common Information Sharing Environment and refers to an architecture and set of protocols, procedures and services for the exchange of data and information across Maritime Authorities of EU (European Union) Member States (MS's). In the context of enabling the implementation and adoption of CISE by different MS's, EU has funded a number of projects that enable the development of subsystems and adaptors intended to allow MS's to connect and make use of CISE. In this context, the Integrated Systems Laboratory (ISL) has led the development of the corresponding Hellenic and Cypriot CISE by developing a Control, Command & Information (C2I) system that unifies all partial maritime surveillance systems into one National Situational Picture Management (NSPM) system, and adaptors that allow the interconnection of the corresponding national legacy systems to CISE and the exchange of data, information and requests between the two MS's. Furthermore, a set of forensics tools that allow geospatial & time filtering and detection of anomalies, risk incidents, fake MMSIs, suspicious speed changes, collision paths, and gaps in AIS (Automatic Identification System), have been developed by combining motion models, AI, deep learning and fusion algorithms using data from different databases through CISE. This paper briefly discusses these developments within the EU CISE-2020, Hellenic CISE and CY-CISE projects and the benefits from the sharing of maritime data across CISE for both maritime surveillance and security.

"gnss-free maritime navigation using radar and digital elevation models","2020","Modern maritime navigation is heavily dependent on satellite systems. Availability of an accurate position is critical for safe operations, but satellite-based navigation systems are vulnerable to interference, jamming, and spoofing. In this work, we propose a method for maritime navigation independent of GNSS, able to provide absolute positioning of the vessel based on marine radar scans. A measurement model is presented where a Digital Elevation Model is used to predict the output of a marine radar, given a hypothetical position. The model, as used by an on-line particle filter, is used to track the movements of a ship from real recorded data. This demonstrates the feasibility of this method for robust positioning, without the need of external positioning signals, in a maritime environment. The tracking only uses sensors commonly available on maritime vessels, and demonstrates its application using freely available elevation data.","on-line particle filter,marine radar,GNSS-free maritime navigation,digital elevation models,absolute vessel positioning,maritime vessels,marine navigation,external positioning signals,Simultaneous localization and mapping,ships,freely available elevation data,modern maritime navigation,particle filtering (numerical methods),Particle measurements,Atmospheric measurements,Radar cross-sections,elevation model,radar signal processing,radar tracking,marine radar scans,maritime environment,robust positioning,hypothetical position,particle filter,navigation,ship movement tracking,satellite-based navigation systems,measurement model,oceanographic techniques,"
"generating bunkering statistics from ais data: a machine learning approach","2021","In shipping, the optimization of the bunkering location is dependent on price, deviation from the planned route and the cost of delays incurred by the bunkering operation itself. Despite their potential importance, detailed statistics for bunkering operations at the individual port call level (e.g. waiting times, barge capacity, location - anchorage or terminal) are not available. I develop a new method, based on the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm, that can a) identify tanker vessels used as bunkering tankers, b) detect stationary ocean-going vessels at anchorage or alongside terminals and c) automatically recognize bunkering operations as a rendezvous between an ocean-going vessel and a bunkering barge. I find that the high time complexity of the DBSCAN algorithm in this setting can be compensated by adjusting the algorithm to distributed computer settings. In the empirical study, I use the output to describe the relative importance of Mediterranean ports for bunkering and provide statistics on waiting and servicing times. The empirical findings are important for the optimization of the bunkering location decision in shipping and studies on regional port competitiveness.","Bunkering operations,Bunkering statistics,DBSCAN,Machine learning,Spatial recognition,"
"a ship movement classification based on automatic identification system (ais) data using convolutional neural network","2020","With a wide use of AIS data in maritime transportation, there is an increasing demand to develop algorithms to efficiently classify a ship’s AIS data into different movements (static, normal navigation and manoeuvring). To achieve this, several studies have been proposed to use labelled features but with the drawback of not being able to effectively extract the details of ship movement information. In addition, a ship movement is in a free space, which is different to a road vehicle’s movement in road grids, making it inconvenient to directly migrate the methods for GPS data classification into AIS data. To deal with these problems, a Convolutional Neural Network-Ship Movement Modes Classification (CNN-SMMC) algorithm is proposed in this paper. The underlying concept of this method is to train a neural network to learn from the labelled AIS data, and the unlabelled AIS data can be effectively classified by using this trained network. More specifically, a Ship Movement Image Generation and Labelling (SMIGL) algorithm is first designed to convert a ship’s AIS trajectories into different movement images to make a full use of the CNN’s classification ability. Then, a CNN-SMMC architecture is built with a series of functional layers (convolutional layer, max-pooling layer, dense layer etc.) for ship movement classification with seven experiments been designed to find the optimal parameters for the CNN-SMMC. Considering the imbalanced features of AIS data, three metrics (average accuracy, F1 score and Area Under Curve (AUC)) are selected to evaluate the performance of the CNN-SMMC. Finally, several benchmark classification algorithms (K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Decision Tree (DT)) are selected to compare with CNN-SMMC. The results demonstrate that the proposed CNN-SMMC has a better performance in the classification of AIS data.","Trajectory image,AUtomatic Identification System (AIS),Ship movement classification,Convolutional Neural Network (CNN),"

"data augmentation method of object detection for deep learning in maritime image","2020","Maritime object detection is an essential element for the situational awareness in autonomous ships. Recently, as the deep learning technology evolves, the attempt that the ship recognize the surrounding environment by using deep learning technology is gradually increasing. Deep learning methods, however, require a lot of data, but lack a publicly available dataset for object detection in the maritime domain. In this paper, we proposed a data augmentation method that can automatically extend the object detection dataset in maritime image.

"a novel technique to identify ais transmissions from vessels which attempt to obscure their position by switching their ais transponder from normal transmit power mode to low transmit power mode","2022","Automatic Identification Systems (AIS) are transponder systems installed on marine vessels which transmit the location, speed and other vessel details. These signals are received by shore side AIS Base stations. The use of AIS is mandatory under international SOLAS regulations for certain categories of vessels. AIS is used to monitor for pollution, search and rescue (SAR) and illegal fishing activity. Some vessel operators deliberately interfere with their AIS transponders, including spoofing their real position or switching their AIS transponder to low transmit power, to reduce the likelihood of being detected but still being in compliance with SOLAS regulations. This might suggest that they are involved in nefarious activity. This paper presents a technique to detect vessels which are switching their Class-A, AIS transponders from normal transmit power to low transmit power mode, by utilising the Received Signal strength Indicator field (RSSI) that the receiving Base Station tags incoming AIS messages with. The technique presented, analyses received RSSI in combination with predicted RSSI values via mathematical modelling and presents a unique detection algorithm. Data from the Irish National AIS was used for the study. Although only a small amount of testing was carried out, results showed that for a test vessel which switched its transponder to low power transmit mode, it was found that a specific drop in RSSI of approximately 10 dBm (decibel-milliwatts) was detectable for different distances from the receiving base station.","AIS spoofing,Received signal strength indicator,Low transmit power,Sybil attack,Automatic identification system,"

But it is not a system that excludes the latter either, since in some exceptional circumstances it is based on it In this paper we will study the operability of the proposed system for Spanish maritime routes with more relevance in terms of traffic density.","Traffic control,vessel sailing identification,high density maritime Spanish routes,medium frequency offshore grid,innovation,Distributed databases,Radio transmitters,Receivers,traffic control,marine traffic control,Repeaters,Maritime traffic control,marine control,Computers,automatic identification system,Marine vehicles,AIS,"

"an ecosystem-based approach to evaluate the ecological quality of mediterranean undersea caves","2015","A theoretical model of structure and functioning was constructed for the Mediterranean undersea cave ecosystem. This model integrates almost all representative components of the cave ecosystem and gives an idea of their faunal compositions, characteristics and related interactions. This model constitutes the basis of the Ecosystem-Based Quality Index (EBQI) of the European Union's Marine Strategy Framework Directive, which aims at evaluating the ecological quality of an ecosystem. It is based on four crucial complementary elements: (i) each component was weighted in accordance with its importance in determining the structure and functioning of the cave ecosystem; (ii) a suite of relevant parameters were defined to assess the ecological state of each component of the cave ecosystem; (iii) these parameters were aggregated into one relevant index, the Cave EBQI (CavEBQI), to summarize the quality evaluation for each cave site; (iv) each value of ecological state is accompanied by a Confidence Index as a measure of its reliability. The CavEBQI was used on 22 Mediterranean undersea caves of France and Italy. Disparities of ecological quality were found among caves but most of them ranged from moderate to high ecological quality. For some caves, no conclusion can be drawn when our method predicts a poor reliability of the evaluation of their ecological quality. This ecosystem-based evaluation of the quality of undersea caves seems to be a powerful tool, with the advantage of being based on almost all its components, rather than just on a few species. It is accompanied by a measure of its reliability, hence it provides a reliable idea of the ecological state of the entire ecosystem at each cave site. Monitoring the ecological state of caves and the effects of disturbances over large geographic and temporal scales is made possible with CavEBQI. Applying the same method to other ecosystems, can provide an integrated view of a marine region, which is essential when addressing questions about protection, conservation and restoration.","Mediterranean Sea,Ecological quality,Marine Strategy Framework Directive,Underwater marine caves,Undersea caves,Ecosystem-based quality index,"

"tightly coupled, graph-based dvl/imu fusion and decoupled mapping for slam-centric maritime infrastructure inspection","2023","In this article, we address the problem of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM)-centric maritime infrastructure inspection [using unmanned surface vehicles (USVs)] via novel approaches in tightly-coupled, graph-based DVL/IMU fusion and decoupled mapping. As our first contribution, we formalize the preintegration of linear velocity measurements, obtained by a Doppler velocity log (DVL), in combination with angular velocity measurements, obtained by an inertial measurement unit (IMU), as binary factors encoding relative position. To evaluate state estimation improvements imparted by DVL/IMU fusion, we implement our proposed factor within a state-of-the-art, graph-based lidar-visual-inertial (LVI) SLAM system as our second contribution. Accuracy and robustness improvements are demonstrated in simulation by comparing maximum a posteriori pose estimates with and without DVL/IMU fusion against ground truth poses. As our third contribution, we propose a map generation framework for downstream inspection applications decoupled from SLAM. In our framework, volumetric data (captured by sonar, lidar, etc.) is transformed into a common world coordinate frame using extrinsic calibrations and SLAM pose estimates as input. Our framework operates over the complete set of raw volumetric data, whereas SLAM systems (both online and offline) typically operate over a subset of down-sampled volumetric data.

Our focus is on the position and role of maritime ports within the PI, as the transport hubs that facilitate most of the world's international trade. We introduce the key notions of the PI vision and expand on the unique position of maritime ports in the PI with the respective challenges this may create. Finally, we discuss the requirements for maritime ports to be ready to take up their role in the PI. We found that policy directions for ports to contribute to the development and implementation of the PI lie within the areas of transport infrastructure, (PI) standardization, advanced terminal areas, ICT hardware, information systems (IS) and platforms, and sustainability management.","international trade,PI,maritime,logistics R&D,transport hubs,Freight transport,transportation,Stakeholders,organisational aspects,logistics,Containers,loading material,information systems,open information exchange,Seaports,sea ports,innovation management,Real-time systems,Logistics,packaging material,freight transport,maritime ports,system-wide optimization,freight handling,Physical Internet (PI),ports,Internet,technological innovation,Technological innovation,production engineering computing,Physical Internet,organizational innovation,"
"machine learning-assisted anomaly detection in maritime navigation using ais data","2020","The automatic identification system (AIS) reports vessels' static and dynamic information, which are essential for maritime traffic situation awareness. However, AIS transponders can be switched off to hide suspicious activities, such as illegal fishing, or piracy. Therefore, this paper uses real world AIS data to analyze the possibility of successful detection of various anomalies in the maritime domain. We propose a multi-class artificial neural network (ANN)-based anomaly detection framework to classify intentional and non-intentional AIS on-off switching anomalies. The multi-class anomaly framework captures AIS message dropouts due to various reasons, e.g., channel effects or intentional one for carrying illegal activities. We extract position, speed, course and timing information from real world AIS data, and use them to train a 2-class (normal and anomaly) and a 3-class (normal, power outage and anomaly) anomaly detection models. Our results show that the models achieve around 99.9% overall accuracy, and are able to classify a test sample in the order of microseconds.","security of data,maritime traffic situation awareness,multiclass anomaly framework,pattern classification,multiclass artificial neural network,AIS message dropouts,neural nets,illegal fishing,learning (artificial intelligence),illegal activities,ships,automatic identification system,marine engineering,machine learning-assisted anomaly detection,maritime navigation,AIS transponders,"
"unsupervised maritime traffic pattern extraction from spatio-temporal data","2015","Maritime traffic pattern extraction is a fundamental and crucial factor for maritime surveillance and anomaly detection. Emerging technologies like Automatic Identification System (AIS) provides multi-dimensional data which is used to construct a maritime traffic model. In this paper, we propose a framework of maritime traffic pattern extraction from vessel AIS information, which learns a traffic pattern using an unsupervised technique, and can be applied on historical Automatic Identification System data. AIS data is a kind of spatio-temporal data that contains information of location data, as well as time stamps. In this way, traffic pattern is described by AIS data. Furthermore, we conduct a simulation experiment that extracts traffic pattern from the AIS data through the unsupervised technique. The proposed framework takes advantage of AIS data, which is a type of the spatiotemporal data that consists of vessel motion information, to perform the experiment. The result shows that the unsupervised framework converts useful information from raw AIS data to effective traffic pattern. The proposed method strongly supports the further research on maritime traffic pattern extraction of AIS data. Besides, an overview of the framework and the unsupervised technique for high-level maritime situation awareness is presented.","Traffic control,Clustering algorithms,unsupervised learning,anomaly detection,Marine vehicles,vessel AIS information,spatiotemporal data,data analysis,ships,automatic identification system,marine engineering,Automatic Identification System,maritime traffic pattern,AIS,maritime surveillance,Data models,feature extraction,Classification algorithms,identification,Trajectory,maritime situation awareness,maritime traffic pattern extraction,density-based clustering,Data mining,"

"maritime anomaly detection and threat assessment","2010","Ships involved in commercial activities tend to follow set patterns of behaviour depending on the business in which they are engaged. If a ship exhibits anomalous behaviour, this could indicate it is being used for illicit activities. With the wide availability of automatic identification system (AIS) data it is now possible to detect some of these patterns of behaviour. Monitoring the possible threat posed by the worldwide movement of ships, however, requires efficient and robust automatic data processing to create a priority list for further investigation. This paper outlines five anomalous ship behaviours: deviation from standard routes, unexpected AIS activity, unexpected port arrival, close approach, and zone entry. For each behaviour, a process is described for determining the probability that it is anomalous. Individual probabilities are combined using a Bayesian network to calculate the overall probability that a specific threat is present.

"the nitrate radical: physics, chemistry, and the atmosphere","1991","This review surveys the present state of knowledge of the nitrate (NO3 radical. Laboratory data on the physics and chemistry of the radical and atmospheric determination of the concentrations of the radical are both considered. One aim of the review is to highlight the relationship between the laboratory and the atmospheric studies. Although the emphasis of the review is on gas-phase processes, relevant studies conducted in condensed phases are mentioned because of their potential importance in the interpretation of cloud and aerosol chemistry. The spectroscopy, structure, and photochemistry of the radical are examined. Here, the object is to establich the spectroscopic basis for detection of the radical and measurement of its concentration in the laboratory and in the atmosphere. Infrared, visible, and paramagnetic resonance spectra are considered. An important quantity discussed is the absorption cross section in the visible region, which is required for quantitative measurements. Interpretation of the spectroscopic features requires an understanding of the geometrical and electronic structure of the radical in its ground and excited states; there is still some controversy about the groundstate geometry, but the most recent experimental evidence 9eg from laser induced fluorescence) and theoretical calculations suggest that the radical has D3h symmetry. Photodissociation of the radical is important in the atmosphere, and the product channels, quantum yields, and dissociation dynamics are discussed. A short examination of the thermodynamics (heat and entropy of formation) of the radical is presented. The main exposition of laboratory studies of the chemistry of the nitrate radical is preceded by a consideration of the techniques used for kinetic and mechanistic studies. Methods for the generation and detection of the radical and the kinetic tools employed are all presented. The exact nature of the technique used in individual studies has some relevance to the way in which data must be analysed, and to the type of mechanistic information that can be extracted. Continuous and stopped flow, flash photolysis and pulse radiolysis, molecular modulation, and static reactor techniques can all provide absolute kinetic data, while relative rate measurements have been a further rich source of information. The treatment of the chemical reactions of the nitrate radical is formally divided into the interactions with non-radical inorganic (deemed to include NO and NO2) and organic species, and with atoms and free radicals. In general, the reactions with open-shell species are much more rapid than those with closed-shell reactants. With the closed-shell partners, addition reactions are faster than abstraction reactions. An attempt is made to consider critically the published data on most reactions of importance, and to tabulate rate constants and temperature dependences where possible. However, it is not the objective of this review to provide recommendations for rate parameters. Evidence for the products of the reactions is sought, and for the branching ratios into the various channels where more than one exists. One theme of this part of the review is the elucidation of correlations of reactivity with structure and with the reactions of other radical species such as OH. The review turns next to a consideration of the role of NO3 in the atmosphere, of its atmospheric sources and sinks, and of field measurements of concentrations of the radical. Long-path visible-absorption spectroscopy and matrix-isolation ESR have both been used successfully in field measurements in the troposphere as well as the stratosphere. Balloon-borne instruments and ground-based remote sensing have been used to obtain stratospheric concentrations. Two of the most important implications of the measurements are that the stratospheric profiles are consistent with accepted chemistry (and, in particular, do not require the postulation of an unidentified scavenging mechanism that had, at one stage, been proposed), and that the highly variable night-time tropospheric concentrations imply that NO3 is a reactive tropospheric constituent. The inter-relation between laboratory studies and atmospheric observations, and the problems in extrapolating laboratory data to atmospheric conditions, are both explored. Initiation of night-time chemical transformations by NO3 and the possible production of OH are considered. The available information is then brought together to see how far NO3 is a sensitive indicator of the state of the atmosphere, and some speculations are presented about the involvement of NO3 (or N2O5) in damage to trees and plants. The final section of the review suggests some issues that remain unresolved concerning the NO3 radical which is directly or indirectly relevant to a better knowledge of the part played by the radical in the atmosphere. Amongst the requirements noted are improved data for the heat of formation of the radical, its absorption cross section in the visible region (and, especially, the temperature dependence of the cross section), and the details of its photochemistry. There is also still a need for a definitive determination of the equilibrium constant and its temperature dependence for the association with NO2 and the reverse dissociation of N2O5. A series of chemical reactions deserves further investigation, especially with regard to elucidation of product channels, and overall oxidation mechanisms also need to be defined better. Future atmospheric studies that are desirable include study of basic NO3 chemistry in the field to understand the influence of humidity on the conversion (probably on surfaces) of N2O5 to HNO3, and thus on NO3 concentrations. In addition, a study of the chemistry of NO3 in the presence of volatile organic compounds and at elevated concentrations of the oxides of nitrogen should help in the understanding of, for example, polluted marine coasts, forests, and urban areas.",""

Other issues could be providing navigational risk detection to support operators, as well as improving resource allocation for greater efficiency and cost savings. Having access to other services, such as weather and environment information, could be precious for route planning.

"a geometry-based fuzzy approach for long-term association of vessels to maritime routes","2023","Either for recreational or professional reasons, ships travel across the globe generating a network of maritime traffic with routes connecting key areas such as ports, off-shore facilities or fishing areas. Monitoring vessels’ position relatively to maritime routes provides crucial information about their destination, and can help reducing the risk of collision. In this paper, we implement a fuzzy logic approach for associating vessels to maritime routes, suitable to variable surveillance contexts and very sparse data. Moreover, the framework is agnostic to the way maritime routes are provided, either reflecting patterns-of-life from statistical models extracted from real data or being hand-crafted by a user. Fuzzy membership functions enable expressing that vessels can belong more or less to route corridors, while they follow only one of the possible routes. The computation of membership scores relies on a precise distance computation involving geometrical properties of Earth, valid for very large route segments. The defuzzification step allows non-specific outputs. Several instantiations with aggregation operators of different semantics are compared on a real dataset of tracklets from the Automatic Identification System, with ground truth labels of routes. The performance is assessed in a quality space along with the three dimensions of correctness, specificity and confidence.","Performance metrics,Route segments,Maritime surveillance,Fuzzy logic classifier,"
"atmospheric reactive mercury concentrations in coastal australia and the southern ocean","2021","Mercury (Hg), especially reactive Hg (RM), data from the Southern Hemisphere (SH) are limited. In this study, long-term measurements of both gaseous elemental Hg (GEM) and RM were made at two ground-based monitoring locations in Australia, the Cape Grim Baseline Air Pollution Station (CGBAPS) in Tasmania, and the Macquarie University Automatic Weather Station (MQAWS) in Sydney, New South Wales. Measurements were also made on board the Australian RV Investigator (RVI) during an ocean research voyage to the East Antarctic coast. GEM was measured using the standard Tekran® 2537 series analytical platform, and RM was measured using cation exchange membranes (CEM) in a filter-based sampling method. Overall mean RM concentrations at CGBAPS and MQAWS were 15.9 ± 6.7 pg m−3 and 17.8 ± 6.6 pg m−3, respectively. For the 10-week austral summer period on RVI, mean RM was 23.5 ± 6.7 pg m−3. RM concentrations at CGBAPS were seasonally invariable, while those at MQAWS were significantly different between summer and winter due to seasonal changes in synoptic wind patterns. During the RVI voyage, RM concentrations were relatively enhanced along the Antarctic coast (up to 30 pg m−3) and GEM concentrations were variable (0.2 to 0.9 ng m−3), suggesting periods of enrichment and depletion. Both RM and GEM concentrations were relatively lower while transiting the Southern Ocean farther north of Antarctica. RM concentrations measured in this study were higher in comparison to most other reported measurements of RM in the global marine boundary layer (MBL), especially for remote SH locations. As observations of GEM and RM concentrations inform global ocean-atmosphere model simulations of the atmospheric Hg budget, our results have important implications for understanding of total atmospheric Hg (TAM).","Tekran 2537,Cation exchange membranes,Gaseous elemental mercury,Southern hemisphere,Cape Grim Baseline Air Pollution Station,Gaseous oxidized mercury,"
"the north atlantic ocean during the last deglaciation","1981","The last deglacial warming of the high-latitude North Atlantic Ocean (40–65°) occurred in three discrete steps: in the southeast and central regions at 13 000 B.P.; in the central and northern sectors at 10 000 B.P.; and in the western (Labrador Sea) sector between 9000 and 6000 B.P. This regionally time-transgressive sequence was punctuated by a major cooling and polar front readvance from 11 000 to 1000 B.P.; this briefly returned most of the high-latitude North Atlantic to almost full-glacial temperatures. Carbonate productivity levels reached minimum values from 16 000 B.P. to 13 000 B.P. and then gradually rose, reaching maximum values in the Holocene at about 6000 B.P. We interpret these changes in carbonate productivity as indicating a major influx of products of glacial wastage (meltwater and icebergs) from 16 000 to 13 000 B.P., with considerably reduced influx after 13 000 B.P. Combined with evidence for meltwater influx to the Gulf of Mexico via the Mississippi River, this suggests that the bulk of volumetric deglaciation in the Northern Hemisphere occurred considerably earlier than the main areal retreat of ice-sheet limits. This implies that the still-extensive ice sheets in the Northern Hemisphere were relatively thin by 13 000 B.P. Because there is no palynologic evidence of unusual atmospheric warming on the southern margins of the ice sheets before 13 000 B.P., we infer that this early phase of rapid ice disintegration occurred largely by iceberg calving and marine downdraw. We also infer that from 16 000 to 13 000 B.P. low winter insolation combined with a low-salinity meltwater layer to form sea ice south to 50°N; after that date, the winter sea-ice cover diminished significantly. We infer from this that the critical flux of winter moisture to the ice sheets was largely cut off from 16 000 to 13 000 B.P. and still significantly suppressed after 13 000 B.P. Moisture starvation thus hastened the disintegration of Northern Hemisphere ice masses. The brief but strong oceanic cooling roughly coincident with the European Younger Dryas (11 000 to 10 000 B.P.) appears to mark a major influx of tabular icebergs from a disintegrating Arctic ice shelf, perhaps enhanced by external forcing at higher frequencies (2500 yr).",""

"automatic detection of rescue targets in maritime search and rescue missions using uavs","2022","Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can be an important resource when performing Search and Rescue (SAR) operations at sea, as this technology is fairly inexpensive when compared to traditional SAR approaches that use significant human resources and expensive air and naval assets, thus enabling the deployment of several UAVs simultaneously in these missions to perform rescue targets search in maritime environments.In order to maximize the usefulness of these UAVs in such operations, we propose a method which utilizes a state-of-the-art object detection network to perform real-time rescue target detection on-board the UAV, using standard RGB cameras, with minimal human intervention, thus enabling an increased vehicle autonomy and search range. Additionally, since the UAVs only relay the candidate images and locations that contain possible rescue targets, given by the onboard detector, it is possible to have several UAVs working in parallel that report back to a single human operator.We have selected the YOLOv4-tiny detection network, pretrained in the COCO dataset, and retrained it to detect rescue targets at sea. For this purpose some datasets were recorded and annotated to simulate the presence of maritime rescue targets. The proposed approach has been validated on an independent test dataset, showing that it has good detection capabilities and thus providing convincing results regarding the use of UAVs with automatic target detection capabilities in SAR missions.","automatic target detection capabilities,rescue missions,remotely operated vehicles,real-time rescue target detection on-board,maritime rescue targets,Cameras,Search problems,significant human resources,Relays,rescue targets search,cameras,object detection,synthetic aperture radar,maritime search,YOLOv4-tiny detection network,Autonomous aerial vehicles,single human operator,increased vehicle autonomy,Real-time systems,autonomous aerial vehicles,state-of-the-art object detection network,mobile robots,search range,image sensors,Object detection,possible rescue targets,Detectors,UAV,automatic detection,"

The paper describes the subsequent adoption of the structure (FCC Rules and Regulations, 1952) by the maritime nations of Europe at the Hague, Holland, in 1957 and by the countries of the world at the International Radio Conference in Geneva, Switzerland, 1959. A description is given of the early and rapid growth of the US VHF structure on the Great Lakes, for safety and navigational purposes, and the expansion upon this usage in Europe to accomplish widespread port operations services. Major steps forward were taken in 1967 at the International Radio Conference on Maritime Mobile Services at Geneva, and in the promulgation of the FCC Rules of 1969. These actions established the 25-kHz channel bandwidth now in use. The availability, after 1968, of low-cost multichannel equipment, coupled with the increased channel availability of the new Rules set in motion a steady growth in usage by small vessels. More recent trends include the expanded usage of VHF to meet increased responsibilities of the US Coast Guard (USCG) for vessel management services and for surveillance of vessel operations. Reference is made to the current use of automation-for efficient systems management and for data exchanges between ship and shore-on the Great Lakes, and to the planning for introduction of automation on the inland rivers of the United States.","Mobile communication,Europe,Radio navigation,Cities and towns,Radio spectrum management,VHF radio communication,Safety,Surveillance,FCC,Bandwidth,Governmental regulations,Marine vehicles,Marine-vehicle communication,Lakes,"
"extraction of maritime road networks from large-scale ais data","2019","Extracting road network information including lane boundaries, lane centerlines, junctions and their relationship from AIS data plays an important role in location based services, urban computing and intelligent transportation systems, etc. However, AIS data are large scale, high noisy, the density and quality are very uneven in different areas, extracting a whole, continuous and smooth maritime road network with rich information from such data is a challenging problem. To address these issues, this paper proposes an adaptive maritime road network extraction approach that can extract both lane boundaries and centerlines for a large sea area from AIS data. Based on a road network definition including nodes, segments and segment curves, the approach designs parallel grid merging and filtering algorithms to determine if a grided area is inside lane or not. Lane boundaries are smoothed through jagged edge filtering and Simple Moving Average algorithms before centerline extraction. We evaluate our method based on real world AIS data in various area across the world's seas. Experimental results show the advantage of our method beyond the close related work.","continuous maritime road network,centerline extraction,trajectory computing,urban computing,segment curves,intelligent transportation systems,Noise measurement,moving average algorithms,road network,visual analysis,lane centerlines,spatio-temporal data mining,world AIS data,lane boundaries,marine engineering,Merging,adaptive maritime road network extraction approach,trajectory data mining,feature extraction,Artificial intelligence,roads,AIS data,Roads,Trajectory,road network information,large-scale AIS data,traffic engineering computing,location based services,Data mining,Junctions,smooth maritime road network,"
"terrigenous sediment supply in the scotia sea (southern ocean): response to late quaternary ice dynamics in patagonia and on the antarctic peninsula","2000","Geochemical and mineralogical compositions of modern and Late Quaternary marine sediments from the Scotia Sea trace sources and transport paths of terrigenous sediment. We discuss downcore variations of compositional data of two sediment cores from the northern and southern Scotia Sea that correlate with fluctuations in magnetic susceptibility. Sediments were derived from very different sources at both localities, as revealed by contrasting clay-mineral assemblages. However, a common feature is the input of more basic and undifferentiated crustal material with the potential of high magnetic susceptibility during glacial periods, indicated by variable quartz/feldspar ratios and major, trace and rare earth elements. Terrigenous sediments mainly originate from nearby terrestrial sources or are introduced through interbasinal sediment transfer from adjacent seas. The observed temporal compositional variations have to be attributed to changes in the relative detrital contributions from the diverse source areas. Ice-mass extensions in southern Patagonia, on the Antarctic Peninsula and adjacent islands likely control the supply of glaciogenic detritus to the open ocean during times of glacial expansion, diluting the sediment input of interbasinal origin. Current transport is mainly responsible for sediment dispersal to the pelagic Scotia Sea and may amplify the glaciological source signals during glacial climate periods, because of a stronger wind forcing of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current.","mineralogy,continental glaciation,Southern Ocean,geochemistry,sediment provenance,terrigenous materials,"
"unsupervised anomaly detection for underwater gliders using generative adversarial networks","2021","An effective anomaly detection system is critical for marine autonomous systems operating in complex and dynamic marine environments to reduce operational costs and achieve concurrent large-scale fleet deployments. However, developing an automated fault detection system remains challenging for several reasons including limited data transmission via satellite services. Currently, most anomaly detection for marine autonomous systems, such as underwater gliders, rely on intensive analysis by pilots. This study proposes an unsupervised anomaly detection system using bidirectional generative adversarial networks guided by assistive hints for marine autonomous systems with time series data collected by multiple sensors. In this study, the anomaly detection system for a fleet of underwater gliders is trained on two healthy deployment datasets and tested on other nine deployment datasets collected by a selection of vehicles operating in a range of locations and environmental conditions. The system is successfully applied to detect anomalies in the nine test deployments, which include several different types of anomalies as well as healthy behaviour. Also, a sensitivity study of the data decimation settings suggests the proposed system is robust for Near Real-Time anomaly detection for underwater gliders.","Anomaly detection,Generative adversarial networks,Marine autonomous systems,Underwater gliders,"
"distributed resource allocation for general energy efficiency maximization in offshore maritime device-to-device communication","2021","In maritime scenario, the communication service, if any, is likely to be expensive due to the high-cost satellite transmissions or the very limited offshore coverage of terrestrial networks. Thus, how to achieve efficient radio resource management is one of the critical issues in maritime communication. In this letter, by exploiting the device-to-device (D2D) mechanism, we identify a general energy efficiency (GEE) optimization problem, which takes into account the physical link performance and the usersâ€™ pairing willingness (PW) quantified by a modified Jaccard coefficient metric. Then, we divide the GEE optimization problem into two sub-problems of user pairing and power allocation, and solve them by a distributed pairing method and by a new distributed resource allocation scheme, respectively.

"real-time multi-object tracking using adaptive filtering and filter banks for maritime applications","2021","This paper presents a novel approach to Multi-Object-Tracking (MOT), which solves the well-known problem of maritime surveillance. We use exteroceptive sensors, such as LiDAR, and Automatic Identification System (AIS), to measure the surroundingsâ€™ Vessels. These objects are associated using evidence theory. Afterward, the proposed algorithm tracks all the objects using a new concept: each object is tracked with a respective filter bank consisting of three Adaptive Extended Kalman Filters (AEKF) as subfilters. These have the same prediction model but different correction algorithms based on various measurement sources. The covariance noise matrices are adapted based on the current measurement quality. The filter banks can overcome drawbacks such as wrong and incomplete measurements, thus improving tracking performance.We have validated the algorithm in real-world scenarios in Rostock Harbor, Germany. The proposed algorithm can track all the objects within the view simultaneously in real-time. By comparing with a reference vessel, the mean 2D position error is ca. 2 m, which is much smaller than the AIS-only solution (5 to 10 m). During the test drive, the filter bank can detect and compensate for incorrect information, such as biased AIS positioning or incomplete LiDAR measurements, to guarantee robust positioning.","covariance matrices,Kalman filters,measurement sources,signal denoising,Prediction algorithms,channel bank filters,respective filter bank,Laser radar,time multiobject tracking,Adaptive Extended Kalman Filters,MultiObject-Tracking,Filter banks,object tracking,Evidence theory,Automatic Identification System,filtering theory,maritime surveillance,Weight measurement,nonlinear filters,maritime applications,Real-time systems,adaptive filtering,size 5.0 m to 10.0 m,wrong measurements,different correction algorithms,tracking performance,Current measurement,geophysical signal processing,current measurement quality,incomplete measurements,size 2.0 m,adaptive filters,oceanographic techniques,"

"planktonic foraminiferal abnormalities in coastal and open marine eastern mediterranean environments: a natural stress monitoring approach in recent and early holocene marine systems","2018","Marine environmental status can be assessed through the study of bio-indicator species. Here, we monitor natural environmental stress by the occurrence of morphologically abnormal planktonic foraminiferal specimens from a suite of surface sediments in the eastern Mediterranean Sea. We also compare Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) abnormality observations from sapropel S1-derived sediments in the Aegean, Libyan and Levantine basins, since they provide a direct record of a natural stress experiment that took place over past time scales. At initial sapropel deposition levels, we observe increased growth asymmetry in Globigerinoides ruber twinned and twisted individuals, possibly associated with eutrophication and anoxia. In modern material, a range of malformations and aberrant morphologies from slight deformity with smaller or overdeveloped chambers to more severe deformity with abnormally protruding or misplaced chambers, distorted spirals, and double tests is also observed, as a result of the hypersaline, oligotrophic and oxygen-depleted nature of the Mediterranean Sea water column. Overall, we highlight the current use of the relative abundance of abnormal tests as a bio-indicator for monitoring natural stress, especially the occurrence of twin specimens as indicative of high-salinity stress conditions, and further illustrate the necessity to map both their spatial and temporal distribution for accurate paleoenvironmental reconstructions. Such an approach presents the advantage to rapidly provide information over wide spatial and temporal scales, extending our ability to monitor a wide variety of environments (from coastal to the open-sea). However, further investigations should extend this approach to test the robustness of our findings in a number of similar oceanic settings.","Twin planktonic bio-indicators,Eutrophication,Eastern Mediterranean hydrodynamics,Natural stress,Salinity,Marine ecosystem monitoring,"

"shipboard trials of an ozone-based ballast water treatment system","2010","Legislation introduced by the United Nations International Maritime Organization (IMO) has focused primarily on standards defining successful treatments designed to remove invasive species entrained in ballast water. An earlier shipboard study found that ozone introduced into salt water ballast resulted in the formation of bromine compounds, measured as total residual oxidants (TRO) that were toxic to both bacteria and plankton. However, the diffuser system employed to deliver ozone to the ballast water tanks resulted in patchiness in TRO distribution and toxicity to entrained organisms. In this follow-up study, the shipboard diffuser system was replaced by a single Venturi-type injection system designed to deliver a more homogeneous biocide distribution. Within-tank variability in TRO levels and associated toxicity to zooplankton, phytoplankton and marine bacteria was measured via a matrix of tubes deployed to sample different locations in treated and untreated (control) tanks. Three trials were conducted aboard the oil tanker S/T Prince William Sound in the Strait of Juan de Fuca off Port Angeles, Washington State, USA, between June and December 2007. Mortalities of plankton and bacteria and oxidant concentrations were recorded for treated and untreated ballast water up to 3days following treatment, and residual toxicity beyond this period was measured by bioassay of standard test organisms. Results indicated uniform compliance with current IMO standards, but only partial compliance with other existing and pending ballast water legislation.","Ballast water,Invasive species,Ozonation,"

"risk management with hard-soft data fusion in maritime domain awareness","2014","Enhanced situational awareness is integral to risk management and response evaluation. Dynamic systems that incorporate both hard and soft data sources allow for comprehensive situational frameworks which can supplement physical models with conceptual notions of risk.

"monitoring of high biomass phaeocystis globosa blooms in the southern north sea by in situ and future spaceborne hyperspectral radiometry","2022","Phaeocystis globosa (P. globosa hereafter) is a phytoplankton species which commonly blooms at high biomass in April–May in the Southern North Sea and forms undesirable foam which accumulates on the beaches. Monitoring of this species is required by EU directives. Measurement of phytoplankton species composition has historically been made by pigment or microscopic analysis of water samples, which is spatially sparse and temporally infrequent e.g. weekly/monthly. In-water instruments such as flow cytometers can provide very high frequency data but at high acquisition and maintenance cost. Automated in situ above water radiometry has the potential to provide very high frequency data at single locations but requires very careful design of processing algorithms in turbid waters with high non-algal absorption. Spaceborne radiometry could provide both very good spatial coverage and moderate/high frequency of data, e.g. daily/weekly, but accurate determination of phytoplankton species composition is considerably more difficult in turbid waters than in open ocean waters. Prior studies based on a limited number of shipborne reflectance measurements suggested feasibility of P. globosa detection in turbid waters from hyperspectral radiometry. The availability of a new autonomous above water hyperspectral radiometer system has enabled further refinement and intensive testing of these techniques. From a time-series of 4356 water reflectance spectra measured near Ostend harbour in Belgian coastal waters from 2020/04/01 to 2020/08/18, two existing algorithms for P. globosa detection were successfully applied. Results show a high biomass P. globosa bloom occurring in late-April/early-May as found every year in water sample analyses for Belgian coastal waters. The high temporal resolution of the radiometric data allows to capture the evolution of the bloom at time scales sufficiently short (hourly and daily) compared to growth/decay and tidal processes. The challenges of extending the methods to future spaceborne instruments are also tested by simulating the impact of errors in sensor inter-band calibration, atmospheric correction and radiometric noise. Results show that because of their spectral coherence, atmospheric correction errors impact only slightly P. globosa detection whereas inaccuracy in inter-band calibration and radiometric noise are much more problematic as they affect each spectral band independently. Because radiometric noise should be reduced in the new generation of hyperspectral sensors and can always be reduced by spatial binning, the inter-band relative calibration uncertainty appears to be the main challenge for spaceborne mission design. Indeed, it was demonstrated that inter-band calibration error should be <0.25% and ideally 0.1% at top of the atmosphere highlighting the need for particular attention to inter-band calibration in sensor design and post processing treatments including vicarious calibration.","Belgian coastal zone,Inter-band calibration,PANTHYR,Signal to noise ratio,Autonomous measurements,Hyperspectral radiometry,Hyperspectral satellite sensors,"
"automatic identification of maritime incidents from unstructured articles","2018","In this paper, we present two Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for identifying maritime incidents described in unstructured articles from multiple sources. The first technique is a document classification scheme that determines if an article describes a maritime incident. Two variations of each article are created: the first only contains the article's title, the other contains the title and content. These are converted to both binary and frequency bags-of-words. Furthermore, two feature selection methods are tested: Weka's CfsSubsetEval and retaining the 300 most frequent words. Each dataset is tested with 41 classifiers from the Weka suite, with the most accurate classifiers including Logistic Regression (98.5%), AdaBoostM1(BayesNet) (98.33%), and RandomForest (97.56%). The second technique performs information extraction on an article to determine the location of the maritime incident.

"cultural dynamics and ceramic resource use at late bronze age/early iron age troy, northwestern turkey","2013","Changes in resource use over time can provide insight into technological choice and the extent of long-term stability in cultural practices. In this paper we re-evaluate the evidence for a marked demographic shift at the inception of the Early Iron Age at Troy by applying a robust macroscale analysis of changing ceramic resource use over the Late Bronze and Iron Age. We use a combination of new and legacy analytical datasets (NAA and XRF), from excavated ceramics, to evaluate the potential compositional range of local resources (based on comparisons with sediments from within a 10 km site radius). Results show a clear distinction between sediment-defined local and non-local ceramic compositional groups. Two discrete local ceramic resources have been previously identified and we confirm a third local resource for a major class of EIA handmade wares and cooking pots. This third source appears to derive from a residual resource on the Troy peninsula (rather than adjacent alluvial valleys). The presence of a group of large and heavy pithoi among the non-local groups raises questions about their regional or maritime origin.","Local production,Bottom-up sampling,Macro-analysis,Multivariate analysis,Neutron Activation Analysis,Statistical power relationships,Legacy datasets,"

"cyber attacks and maritime situational awareness evidence from japan and taiwan","2016","This paper argues that cyber-attacks are increasingly being seen as a threat to maritime situational awareness in the Asia Pacific region, and highlights how the Japanese and Taiwanese governments have been developing both offensive and defensive cyber operations to ameliorate vulnerabilities in their naval fleets vis-a-vis their respective relationships with China. The paper begins by exploring traditional understandings of maritime situational awareness and how changes in Information and Communications Technology (ICT) have transformed the maritime strategic environment in recent decades. The paper moves on to explore how countries in the region, including China, the US, Japan and Taiwan are developing new capabilities in this area and new military doctrine to avoid disruptions to maritime operations. The final section of the paper presents a forward looking analysis of how cyber-attacks could affect military responses to territorial dispute in the South China Sea in particular, and the normative dangers of cyber militarization in the naval domain.

"maritime target localization from bistatic range measurements in space-based passive radar","2021","In this article, localization of a maritime target using a passive multistatic radar system, consisting of a single receiver and a number of satellites as its transmitters, is investigated. The set of communication satellites and also the global navigation satellite system (GNSS), including GPS, Glonass, and Galileo, are employed as illuminators of opportunity. In the receiver, the reflected signals from the target along with the direct signal from the satellites are employed to extract a set of bistatic range measurements. Leveraging these measurements and the satellite's position information, a novel localization method considering zero height of maritime target and appropriate combination of the measurement signals is presented. The proposed method is efficient for localization of maritime targets in cases with arbitrary bistatic range accuracy. The results of numerical simulations confirm the efficiency of the proposed method and its superior performance in comparison with the state-of-the-art methods.","Satellites,direct signal,GNSS,marine radar,localization method,Glonass,distance measurement,reflected signals,passive radar,Location awareness,Global Positioning System,bistatic range measurements,satellite position information,communication satellites,maritime target localization,numerical simulations,measurement signals,single receiver,passive radar sensors,satellites direct signal,arbitrary bistatic range accuracy,Satellite broadcasting,passive multistatic radar system,global navigation satellite system,Passive radar,Galileo,global navigation satellite system (GNSS),Receivers,Signal to noise ratio,space-based passive radar,Bistatic range measurements,maritime target,Global navigation satellite system,"
"maritime traffic route detection framework based on statistical density analysis from ais data using a clustering algorithm","2022","Maritime traffic routes by ships navigation vary according to country and geographic characteristics, and they differ according to the characteristics of the ships. In ocean areas adjacent to coasts, regulated routes are present, e.g., traffic separation scheme for ships entering and leaving; however, most ocean areas do not have such routes. Maritime traffic route research has been conducted based on computer engineering to create routes; however, ship characteristics were not considered. Thus, this article proposes a framework to generate maritime traffic routes using statistical density analysis. Here, automatic identification system (AIS) data are used to derive quantitative traffic routes. Preprocessing is applied to the AIS data, and a similar ship trajectory pattern is decomposed into a matrix based on the Hausdorffâ€“distance algorithm and then stored in a database. A similar pattern makes the AIS trajectory simple using the Douglasâ€“Peucker algorithm. In addition, density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) is performed to identify the waypoints of vessels then create routes by connecting waypoints. The width of maritime routes created based on a similar ship trajectory is subjected to kernel density estimation analysis (KDE). Then, waypoints evaluation of the main route is performed from the results of KDE 75% and 90% considering the statistical in the total maritime traffic, and the results applied to the targeted ocean area are compared. Finally, the result of KDE 90% of maritime traffic with framework analyzed the safety route, which can be a basis for developing routes for maritime autonomous surface ships.","traffic separation scheme,ocean areas,marine accidents,Clustering algorithms,Safety,targeted ocean area,Douglas-Peucker algorithm,automatic identification system data,vehicle routing,total maritime traffic,Marine vehicles,maritime autonomous surface ships,quantitative traffic routes,geographic characteristics,DBSCAN,statistical analysis,ships,marine safety,kernel density estimation,AIS trajectory simple,maritime traffic route detection framework,kernel density estimation analysis,Oceans,Hausdorff-distance algorithm,ship trajectory pattern,framework,pattern clustering,Artificial intelligence,statistical density analysis,marine engineering computing,Trajectory,ship characteristics,maritime traffic route research,Navigation,safety route,density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise,clustering algorithm,AIS data,maritime traffic route,"

"detection and geovisualization of abnormal vessel behavior from video","2021","Intelligent maritime situational awareness pursues an effective understanding of the majority of the activities related to the maritime domain (impacting the safety, security, economy, or environment), with the aid of artificial intelligence systems. Such an understanding requires the development of automated processes capable of not only detecting abnormal behavior but also of visually-representing and interpreting it. Although much progress has been made in anomaly detection and visualization using vessel self-reporting positioning data, there have been no corresponding advances using video data, despite the increasing use of cameras for maritime surveillance. In this work, we introduce a framework which goes beyond vessel tracking for anomaly detection in video, and is therefore applicable to scenes with a high density of vessels. The proposed framework detects abnormal behavior using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and interprets this knowledge using metrics derived from clustering the positions and courses provided by an independent vessel/motion detector. These detections are geovisualized using an advanced displaying tool where detected abnormal behavior may be localized on the globe, providing an infrastructure for intelligent maritime situational awareness.","generative adversarial network,surveillance,Safety,anomaly detection,Generative adversarial networks,data visualisation,Knowledge engineering,security of data,geovisualization,intelligent maritime situational awareness,marine engineering,abnormal vessel behavior,maritime surveillance,vessel self-reporting positioning data,object detection,maritime domain,Measurement,Real-time systems,video signal processing,artificial intelligence systems,Tools,artificial intelligence,Detectors,"
"multiple episodes of fluid flow in the sw barents sea (loppa high) evidenced by gas flares, pockmarks and gas hydrate accumulation","2012","Gas and gas hydrates have gained considerable attention in the last 20yr due to their possible impact on global climate change from methane escalations. Our study area, the SW Barents Sea, is unique in its evolution due to the effect of glaciations which removed thick layers of sediment from the seabed. Unloading due to erosion and deglaciation resulted in opening of pre-existing faults and creation of new ones, facilitating fluid migration and eventually escape into the water from the subsurface. Expressions of hydrocarbon gas accumulation and fluid flow such as gas hydrates and pockmarks are widely distributed in the Barents Sea. Several gas flares, some of them 200m high in echograms, occur along a segment of the Ringvassøy Loppa Fault Complex, indicating open fractures and active fluid flow. Observation of gas flares along regional fault complexes outside pockmark regions indicates that present gas escape occurs along faults only. The pockmark formation and gas flares belong to different episodes of fluid flow. The pockmarks are absent outside soft sediment depocentres indicating that their existence is related to the presence of recording medium. The thin sediment cover in pockmarks and their penetration down into glaciomarine sediments indicate that they formed after deposition of these sediments and that fluid escape was active to the very recent past. Methane hydrate stability zone (MHSZ) modelling shows that after the last glacial maximum 18000–2000014Cyears ago, the MHSZ has thinned from 600m to zero in most parts of the SW Barents Sea. The fluid expulsion probably happened after retreat of the glaciers causing release of methane from dissociation of methane hydrates through fluid escape processes which lasted until recently. Bottom simulating reflectors (BSR) observed are probably due to structure II hydrates formed from gas containing higher order hydrocarbon components such as ethane, propane, etc. along with methane. The study area falls close to the new gigantic oil discoveries, Skrugard and Havis, and north of the Snøhvit hydrocarbon field.","pockmarks,gas hydrate,BSR,gas flares,Barents Sea,seismic,"
"pollution levels and deposition processes of airborne organic pollutants over the central adriatic area: temporal variabilities and source identification","2021","First data on polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and nitro-aromatic compounds (NACs) in aerosols as well as of PAHs, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and NACs in bulk and wet atmospheric deposition samples were simultaneously obtained during 6-month-long field campaign at the costal central Adriatic area. Special attention was given to open-fire biomass burning episodes as extreme events common for the overall Mediterranean coastal area in order to gain a better understanding of the atmospheric variabilities and potential sources of trace organic pollutants in coastal environments. Diesel and gasoline combustion related to land and maritime traffic as well as occasional open-fire episodes (forest fires) were found to be the dominant pollution sources of PAHs in PM10 particles. NACs were determined almost exclusively in samples affected by biomass burning episodes. Open-fire episodes had a strong contribution to the overall NACs atmospheric deposition fluxes. Several chlorinated congeners of PCBs were predominantly contributed in deposition samples.","PAHs,NACs,Atmospheric deposition,PCBs,Coastal area,Biomass burning,"

"multiple oceanographic hf surface-wave radars applied to maritime surveillance","2014","In the context of maritime surveillance, low-power high-frequency surface-wave (HFSW) radars are attracting significant attention as cost-effective tools for long-range ship detection and tracking applications. In this paper, multi-target tracking and data fusion techniques are applied to live-recorded data from a network of three oceanographic HFSW radars installed on the coast of the German Bight, in the North Sea. This campaign follows a previous one conducted in 2009, in which two HFSW radars were deployed on the coast of the Ligurian Sea, in the Mediterranean. Ship reports from the automatic identification system, recorded from a number of coastal stations, are exploited as ground truth information. A methodology is then applied to classify the fused tracks and to estimate single-sensor and data fusion performances.

"a proactive system for maritime environment monitoring","2016","The ability to remotely detect and monitor oil spills is becoming increasingly important due to the high demand of oil-based products.

"energy-saving resource allocation with lightweight blockchain in maritime wireless communication networks","2020","With the exploration of the ocean resource, establishing an energy-efficient and reliable maritime wireless communication network becomes more and more urgent. In maritime wireless communication networks, data types, such as search and rescue information, business information and surveillance video, will be continuously generated and need to be scheduled and shared. At the same time, there will be some trading needs. How to realize information exchange and ensure safe transactions is an urgent problem to be solved. To this end, this paper aims to establish a distributed network architecture composed of buoys and base stations (BS) at sea, and uses blockchain technology to solve the problem of the completeness of its decentralized network system. To satisfy the computing requirement companied with the blockchain, buoys and BSs in networks also have the computing ability. Due to the fact that buoys deployed in the ocean are hard to be frequently charged, the energy consumption problem is studied in this paper via the joint optimization of the communication resource and computing resource. We combine the weighted shortest processing time first (WSPT) model and the dynamic frequency and voltage scaling (DVFS) energy consumption model to propose an improved energy-saving algorithm.

"remote sensing satellite technology to determine the center of the maritime defense logistics route for securing the indonesian capital city (ikn)","2022","Displacement of the capital of Indonesia has been provided for in Law Number 3 of 2022, namely the IKN Nusantara which is one of the centers of gravity or the center of national strategic strength so that security for the area is very much needed. In order to secure the IKN from all possible enemy attacks, a military defense base is needed that functions as a Logistics support center to support all military operations. The purpose of this study is to determine a strategic location as a center for maritime defense logistics distribution lines in order to secure the IKN area using the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) method combined with satellite image analysis using a Geographic Information System (GIS) by considering the criteria and sub-criteria in determining the location center for maritime defense logistics distribution lines. The results of the research from the AHP weighting method show that the priority order of criteria based on experts is safety from natural conditions, population conditions, environmental locations, distribution line conditions, and required cost. The results of remote sensing satellite image data processing with analysis using Geographic Information Systems with ArcGIS software shows that the results of satellite image overlays are equipped with regional boundaries and routes around IKN. The determination of the location of the center of the distribution line for the defense logistics of the marine sector is concentrated in Samboja District, surely in the Kampung Lama Village which is also used as the location point for the pier plan.

"elemental geochemistry and organic facies of selected cretaceous coals from the benue trough basin in nigeria: implication for paleodepositional environments","2022","Benue Trough basin is geologically subdivided into three segments. It consists of marine and continental sediments that are affected by folding movements. In the upper section, the continental coal-bearing Campano-Maastrichtian-age is found within Gombe Sandstone and the Cenozoic Kerri-Kerri Formation of the Tertiary. In the middle segment, the late Turonian/early Santonian coal-bearing Awgu Formation lies conformably on the Ezeaku Formation. In the lower part, shales at Nkporo mark marine incursion and deposition of the Maastrichtian Mamu Formation coal measures. Cretaceous coal samples taken from the three segments of Benue Trough basin were examined using ultimate and proximate, organic petrographic, x-ray fluorescence (XRF) and laser ablation-induced coupled plasma spectroscopy (LA-ICPMS) analytical techniques. Results of trace element ratios, Ce/Ce* values (“where Ce* is the theoretical Ce value derived from a chondrite-normalized rare earth element (REE) pattern”), authigenic uranium values, and low hydrogen content indicate deposition under oxic to suboxic conditions. However, the V/Ni and V/Sc ratios indicate under oxic, suboxic to reducing conditions. The Y/Ho values for selected coals are lower than the range for seawater, indicating terrigenous influence. The Sr/Ba values indicate low influence of saline water during deposition and a strong continental rather than marine influence. High value of vitrinite and low proportion of liptinite/intertinite suggest that peat in the study areas were situated on the irregular basin floor where sediment thicknesses vary from place to place thus the depositional environments shifted causing mineral matter filling in coal. Based on the tissue preservation index (TPI) and gelification index (GI), LFB, CHK, OKB, LMZ, IMG; and ENG (high GI and high TPI) were deposited in telmatic facies; wet-forest swamps with rapid organic matter accumulation. This trend indicates mild humification and strong gelification of plant tissues which ascribed to high rate of subsidence with wood- and bark-derived telovitrinite. The MGA peats were deposited in terrestrial facies in a dry-forest swamp with wood-derived telo-inertinite. The coal samples code-named IMG and ENG were deposited in planar margin mires. However, coal samples code-named LFB, CHK and LMZ were deposited in planar central mires. Lastly, OKB and MGA were deposited in transitional-wet and transitional-dry mire. The low V and Ni concentrations, low H/C, high O/C, high C/N, and very low N/C ratios <0.05 implies Type III land-plant organic matter that is not oil-prone. The depositional environments interpretations of investigated coal seams indicate that the coals were deposited within a telmatic, limnic, limno-telmatic and open march zone. Generally, a combination of results from inorganic geochemistry and organic petrology is required for precise and all-inclusive determination of coal depositional environments.","Macerals,Coal,Petroleum source evaluation,Benue Trough,Depositional facies,"
"improving group transit schemes to minimize negative effects of maritime piracy","2014","Contemporary maritime piracy around the Horn of Africa presents a serious threat to the global shipping industry. A number of countermeasures were deployed to minimize the probability of a successful ship hijack, one of them being the establishment of the International Recommended Transit Corridor (IRTC). Currently, all ships transiting the Gulf of Aden are recommended to follow the IRTC and take part in group transit schemes (GTSs)-prescribed fixed schedules stating a time of arrival to the beginning of the corridor and a speed at which to sail through the corridor. We provide a number of contributions that improve the GTS: we formalize the grouping problem, we design an efficient algorithm able to compute optimal fixed GTSs with respect to the distribution of ships' speeds, we provide a real-world data set with speeds of ships transiting the IRTC, and we compare the optimal fixed schedules with the currently deployed schedule and quantify possible savings. Additionally, we propose on-demand GTSs-customized schedules for a group of arriving ships-that take into account speeds, risk aversion, and actual positions of arriving ships. We formulate the problem of the optimal on-demand grouping as a biobjective mixed integer program, and we compute a set of Pareto optimal solutions.

"maritime environment perception based on deep learning","2022","Environment perception is an essential aspect of automated maritime vehicles, especially in high-traffic areas. In recent years, deep-learning-based object detection using LiDAR has been well developed in the automotive sector but has not yet seen a similar level of sophisticated development in maritime applications. In these applications, LiDAR detection should be fused with other maritime navigation systems such as the automatic identification system (AIS) to expand the detection range. To address this, we propose a novel deep-learning-based concept for maritime environment perception by using LiDAR as a primary sensor and AIS as an assisting information source. This approach consists of three functional modules: object detection, multi-object tracking, and static environment mapping. For object detection, we apply a convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect floating objects represented as oriented bounding boxes. To train the CNN, we propose a method that generates simulated labeled datasets. The detected objects from CNN are tracked with Kalman Filter banks. The remaining LiDAR data points are treated as static environments and represented by polygons. We evaluated the approach by using simulative and real-world datasets. In the simulation, the average precision of the CNN object detector reaches 60.8%, with a data processing rate of 40 Hz in GPU. Our real-world evaluations show that this approach can track 83% of the vessels in a crowded harbor, with the overall intersection over union reaching 64%.

"uav-assisted maritime legitimate surveillance: joint trajectory design and power allocation","2023","This paper investigates a novel maritime wireless surveillance scenario, where a legitimate monitor vessel moves around to eavesdrop the suspicious communication from a suspicious unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to a suspicious vessel with the help of a cooperative UAV. Specifically, the cooperative UAV can adjust its jamming power and trajectory to exactly control the transmission rate of the suspicious link, thus improving the monitor vessel's surveillance performance. Furthermore, since the cooperative UAV cannot land or replenish energy on the sea surface, its jamming power allocation on the ocean should be carefully designed by the energy thresholds. Under such setup, we formulate a sum eavesdropping rate maximization problem, which jointly optimizes the jamming power and three-dimensional (3D) trajectory of the cooperative UAV, as well as the two-dimensional (2D) trajectory of the monitor vessel. To address this non-convex optimization problem, we decompose the design problem into three subproblems and propose an iterative algorithm to find its suboptimal solution. Numerical results show that the proposed jamming-assisted 3D joint design can significantly improve the eavesdropping rate and save the jamming power compared to the benchmark schemes.","Trajectory,Wireless communication,UAV cooperative jamming,trajectory design,Eavesdropping,Surveillance,Autonomous aerial vehicles,Three-dimensional displays,power allocation,Maritime legitimate surveillance,Jamming,"
"context-aware dynamic asset allocation for maritime interdiction operations","2020","This paper validates two approximate dynamic programming approaches on a maritime interdiction problem involving the allocation of multiple heterogeneous assets over a large area of responsibility to interdict multiple drug smugglers using heterogeneous types of transportation on the sea with varying contraband weights. The asset allocation is based on a probability of activity surface, which represents spatio-temporal target activity obtained by integrating intelligence data on drug smuggler whereabouts/waypoints for contraband transportation, behavior models, and meteorological and oceanographic information. We validate the proposed architectural and algorithmic concepts via several realistic mission scenarios. We conduct sensitivity analyses to quantify the robustness and proactivity of our approach, as well as to measure the value of information used in the allocation process.

"computationally effective range migration compensation in pcl systems for maritime surveillance","2018","In this paper, we consider the possibility of extending the coherent processing interval (CPI) as a way to improve target detection capability in passive radars for maritime surveillance applications. Despite the low velocity of the considered targets, range walk effects could limit the performance of the system when long CPIs are considered. To overcome these limitations while keeping the computational load controlled, we resort to a sub-optimal implementation of the Keystone Transform (KT), based on Lagrange polynomial interpolation, recently presented by the authors and successfully applied against aerial targets. Following those promising results, we extend the proposed approach to a coastal surveillance scenario. In the considered case, since longer CPI values are used, the proposed strategy appears to be even more attractive with respect to a conventional KT implementation based on the Chirp-Z Transform interpolation. In fact, comparable detection performance are obtained with a remarkable computational load saving. In detail, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated against experimental data provided by Leonardo S.p.A., using a DVB-T based passive radar.","Chirp-Z Transform interpolation,marine radar,aerial targets,radar detection,passive radars,passive radar,transforms,passive coherent location,interpolation,target tracking,range migration compensation,target detection capability,Computational complexity,polynomials,object detection,search radar,digital video broadcasting,radar imaging,Interpolation,computational load saving,PCL systems,Keystone Trasform,DVB-T based passive radar,long coherent processing interval,coherent processing interval,Lagrange polynomial interpolation,Keystone Transform,maritime surveillance applications,Passive radar,walk effects,Signal to noise ratio,Surveillance,CPI values,Transforms,coastal surveillance scenario,KT implementation,"

"large environmental disturbances caused by magmatic activity during the late devonian hangenberg crisis","2020","A wide range of various proxies (e.g., mineralogy, organic carbon, inorganic geochemistry, C and Mo isotopes, and framboidal pyrite) were applied for interpretation of changing oceanic redox conditions, bioproductivity, and the regional history of magmatic activity. This resulted in internally consistent interpretation of the late Famennian Hangenberg Crisis in subtropical deepest water sites of the epeiric Rhenohercynian and Saxo–Thuringian basins, as well as more open sites of the Paleo-Tethys Ocean. High mercury concentrations were detected in all of the studied sections, with the highest values strata in the Carnic Alps (up to 20 ppm) and Thuringia (up to 1.5 ppm). The beginning of the Hg anomaly and the presence of pyroclastic material, indicate that local magmatic activity was initiated before the deposition of the Hangenberg Black Shale (HBS). The onset of the HBS deposition coincided with the expansion of phosphate-enriched, anoxic to euxinic waters during short-lived CO2-greenhouse spike of a warm–humid climate. Intensive magmatic activity was a trigger for climatic changes, an excessive eutrophication, and an accelerated burial of organic carbon during the Hangenberg transgressive pulse. The injection of catastrophic amounts of CO2, toxic elements and acids from volcanic activity could have led to acidification, mutation of spores, and episodes of mass mortality of marine plankton.","Redox conditions,Carbon and molybdenum isotopes,Hangenberg Black Shale,Inorganic geochemistry,Volcanic activity,Mineralogical composition,"

This work provides an overview on the jamming threat and the main countermeasures techniques, especially in the fields of robust signal processing, adaptive antenna arrays and multi sensor fusion.

"a strategy for detecting derelict fishing gear at sea","2012","Derelict fishing gear (DFG) is a highly persistent form of marine pollution known to cause environmental and economic damage. At-sea detection of DFG would support pelagic removal of this gear to prevent and minimize impacts on marine environments and species. In 2008, experts in marine debris, oceanography, remote sensing, and marine policy outlined a strategy to develop the capability to detect and ultimately remove DFG from the open ocean. The strategy includes three interrelated components: understanding the characteristics of the targeted DFG, indirectly detecting DFG by modeling likely locations, and directly detecting pelagic DFG using remote sensing. Together, these components aim to refine the search area, increase the likelihood of detection, and decrease mitigation response time, thereby providing guidance for removal operations. Here, we present this at-sea detection strategy, relate it to relevant extant research and technology, and identify gaps that currently prevent successful at-sea detection and removal of DFG.","Remote sensing,Marine debris,Derelict fishing gear,"
"butyltin residues in blue mussels (mytilus edulis) and arkshells (scapharca broughtonii) collected from korean coastal waters","2002","Butyltin compounds (BTs) including tributyltin (TBT) and its degradation products, di- (DBT) and mono-butyltin (MBT), were determined in bivalves such as blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) and arkshells (Scapharca broughtonii) collected from Korean coastal waters. BTs were detected in all the blue mussels and arkshells analyzed. The concentrations of total butyltin (ΣBTs: MBT+DBT+TBT) in blue mussels and arkshells ranged from 49 to 2500 ng/g and 29 to 87 ng/g wet weight, respectively. Higher concentrations of BTs were found in blue mussels collected from Okpo and Kohyonsong Bays and Jangsengpo Harbor where large shipyards and harbors are located with dry-dock facilities. This suggested that maritime activities nearby the harbors play a major role as the source of BTs. Concentrations of TBT in mussels collected from Korea were one of the highest values reported, suggesting ongoing TBT contamination in Korea. Among BTs, TBT was the predominant compound both in blue mussels and arkshells collected from almost all the sampling locations, indicating the fresh input of TBT in Korean coastal waters. Smaller mussels tended to accumulate BTs at higher concentrations than larger ones, which may be due to higher filtration rate of small mussels and/or contact with surface microlayer in intertidal zones.","Blue mussel (),Butyltin compounds,Korean coastal waters,Antifouling paint,TBT,"

"chapter 26 - dealing with space weather: the canadian experience","2018","Space weather phenomena, in the form of the aurora borealis (northern lights), have always been part of the Canadian experience. However, in modern times, we have come to realize how these phenomena can affect the different technological systems on which we rely. High-frequency radio opened up communication links to remote communities, except when the ionosphere was disrupted by space weather disturbances. Such disturbances are now a problem for commercial aircraft using transpolar routes. As long-distance communications shifted to using satellites, Telesat's Anik series of satellites provided phone and television links across the country, but suffered a major blow when energetic electrons damaged the attitude control circuitry for Anik-E2. After heroic efforts to implement an alternative control system, the satellite was brought back into operation 5 months later. On the ground, the expanding power network was vulnerable to the extra currents created during geomagnetic disturbances and on March 13, 1989, a major magnetic storm caused widespread effects, including the blackout of the Hydro-Québec power system. Canadian operators of aeromagnetic surveys and directional drilling have also had to cope with geomagnetic disturbances. Global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) are another technology affected by ionospheric disturbances and a number of correction services have been developed, including the Canadian Coast Guard's DGPS service for maritime users. In parallel with the increasing engineering requirements to design or manage systems in Canada that are affected by space weather, the science behind space weather phenomena has been a particular focus of Canadian scientists who have made great contributions in this area. The same high-latitude location that makes Canada more exposed to space weather hazards also makes it a prime location for space weather observations and the country is now a giant array of space weather research instruments. The challenge for the future is to use the new knowledge being generated to help protect Canadian infrastructure from future extreme space weather events.","Satellites,Radio communications,Space weather,Canada,Surveying and navigation,Power systems and pipelines,"

"tensor-based approach for background-foreground separation in maritime sequences","2021","The complexity of a scene in addition to the need for real-time processing are the main challenges that face any background/foreground separation approach for maritime environment. Recent studies on Low-rank and Sparse Separation (LSS) achieved good performance when compared to traditional background subtraction techniques in segregating the foreground from a complex background. However, the issue of maintaining this type of a separation via an updating mechanism is not well addressed by the majority of LSS approaches. The study presents a tensor based singular value decomposition approach for background/foreground separation. The approach is uniquely designed to deal with most challenges related to a maritime environment such as sea dynamics, boat wakes, variety of foreground objects, and camera jitter. Furthermore, the proposed approach operates incrementally via updating the separation components as opposed to reperforming the decomposition on the entire video sequence when a set of frames arrives. Additionally, a forgetting mechanism is employed in the proposed approach to efficiently handle challenges such as Stationary Foreground Objects (SFOs) and ghost effects. The performance of the proposed method with several state-of-the-art LSS and Non-LSS techniques on videos with complex maritime scenarios are evaluated.

In an earlier paper, we presented the parameterization of the channel model for the narrowband case based on recordings of GPS L1  $C/N_{0}$  time-series in different sea state conditions. Additionally, we performed wider band measurements using GPS E5a (â‰ˆ10 Mcpsâ€”chips per secondâ€” > 20 MHz bandwidth) and obtained estimations of power delay profiles. Due to lack of dynamic range and delay resolution, in these measurements, no conclusive information was gathered on the time spreading caused by the channel. What was clear is that the time spreading was not significant outside the first signal chip, i.e.,  $\approx 0.1~\mu \text{s}$ . Still wideband modeling is required within this spreading range. Now, we want to extend the model to the wideband case. To achieve this goal, we have used a rough surface scattering model applicable to sea surfaces and employed it to characterize the time dispersion to be expected.

"energy-efficient task offloading of edge-aided maritime uav systems","2023","This paper considers the autonomous detecting and tracking task of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in the maritime environment. Due to the high computational complexity of the image-processing task, the strict latency requirement of the tracking task, and the shortage of batteries and computational capability of UAVs, the UAVs can offload the computing-intensive task to the edge computing server (ECS) to reduce the task latency and energy consumption. Even though, the large latency and energy consumption brought by some high-definition image-processing task still make some visual tracking difficult to perform. We first investigate the impact of video frame resolution on computing task size and detection accuracy, and further on task latency and energy consumption. In addition, we optimize the transmission power, the local CPU frequency, the offloading rate of UAVs, and the bandwidth allocation between UAVs. We model the UAVs tracking system as an energy consumption optimization problem with the constraint of task latency. Although the proposed optimization problem is complex, we transform the optimization problem into several subproblems with decoupling and rigorous mathematical proof.

"a multi-task learning-based framework for global maritime trajectory and destination prediction with ais data","2022","Automatic Identification System (AIS) was initially developed for tracking ships and avoiding collisions. As numerous small satellites were launched in recent years, millions of AIS messages are captured by these satellite AIS providers every day.

We employed deep learning approaches for large-scale maritime prediction and identifies the most suitable deep neural networks for this specific application. Three prediction models, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Dense Neural Networks (DNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) have been tested in the framework. A multi-task learning architecture is implemented based on test results.

"maritime ship target imaging with gnss-based passive multistatic radar","2023","In the field of maritime surveillance, the global navigation satellite system (GNSS)-based passive radar has proven its potential for moving target detection (MTD), localization, and velocity estimation. The next stage is to investigate the possibility of obtaining the radar image of the moving ship for target recognition. However, the limited signal power budget of GNSS prevents the conventional inverse synthetic aperture radar technique that is based on target rotational motion and short observation time for GNSS-based passive radar imaging moving target. In this article, a two-stage imaging processing method relying on the target translational motion over a long observation time is proposed. The first stage confirms the presence of the target by a long-time MTD processing technique. In the second stage, based on the analysis of the Doppler history of the target signal in the slow-time domain, short-time Fourier transform and modified random sample consensus are combined to robustly estimate target velocity with reduced computation complexity. To obtain the focused bistatic image, azimuth compression is conducted by using the estimated target velocity. Finally, an image fusion operation is implemented to combine the bistatic images achievable from multiple satellites so that a multistatic image with high quality can be created. The effectiveness of the proposed method is confirmed by the real experimental results of three cargo ships illuminated by several satellites.","moving ship,Fourier transforms,inverse synthetic aperture radar technique,focused bistatic image,GNSS-based passive multistatic radar,short-time Fourier transform,target detection,passive radar,Marine vehicles,image fusion operation,short observation time,long observation time,maritime ship target imaging,cargo ships,image fusion,target velocity estimation,ships,satellite navigation,maritime surveillance,estimated target velocity,two-stage imaging processing method,object detection,passive radar imaging,synthetic aperture radar,bistatic images,target rotational motion,radar imaging,Doppler effect,Radar,target translational motion,velocity estimation,Global navigation satellite system (GNSS)-based passive radar,Passive radar,Radar imaging,GNSS-based passive radar,target signal,Imaging,long-time MTD processing technique,slow-time domain,radar image,target recognition,multistatic image,Global navigation satellite system,global navigation satellite system-based passive radar,"

"research and application of artificial intelligence techniques for wire arc additive manufacturing: a state-of-the-art review","2023","Recent development in the Wire arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) provides a promising alternative for fabricating high value-added medium to large metal components for many industries such as aerospace and maritime industry. However, challenges stemming from the demand for increasingly complex and high-quality products, hinder the widespread adoption of the conventional WAAM method for manufacturing industries. The development of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques may provide new opportunities to upgrade WAAM to the next generation. Hence, this paper provides a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art research on AI techniques in WAAM. Firstly, we proposed a novel concept of intelligent wire arc additive manufacturing (IWAAM) and revealed the challenges of developing IWAAM. Secondly, an overview of the research progress of applying AI techniques to several aspects of the WAAM process chain, including fabrication process pre-design, online deposition control and offline parameter optimization is provided. Thirdly, the relevant machine learning algorithms, and the knowledge of corresponding AI techniques, are also reviewed in detail. Through reviewing the current research articles, issues of applying AI techniques to the WAAM process are presented and analysed. Finally, future research perspectives in terms of novel AI technique applications and AI technique enhancement are discussed. Through this systematic review, it is expected that WAAM may gradually develop into a smart/intelligent manufacturing technology in the context of Industry 4.0 through the adoption of AI techniques.","Algorithm,Artificial intelligence (AI),Intelligent manufacturing,Wire arc additive manufacturing (WAAM),Machine learning,"
"ship classification based on ship behavior clustering from ais data","2019","Since the introduction of the Automatic Identification System (AIS), AIS data has proven to be a valuable source of ship behavior analysis using data mining. It records ship position, speed and other behavior attributes at specific time intervals in all voyages at sea and in ports. However, the current studies in ship behavior analyze the behavior patterns either with a subjective choice of classification for behavior differences among the groups of ships or without any classification at all. In order to fill this gap, a new methodology for ship classification in ports based on behavior clustering is developed by analyzing AIS data from the port of Rotterdam. Besides a proper data preparation, the proposed methodology consists of two steps: step I, clustering ship behavior in a port area and identifying the characteristics of the clusters; step II, classifying ships to such behavior clusters based on the ship characteristics. The clustering results present both the behavior patterns and the behavior change patterns for ship path and speed over ground, which are the dominant behavior attributes for ships in ports. Some patterns of integral ship behavior can also be revealed by investigating the correlation between the two behavior attributes. Our research has shown that length and beam can be adopted as explanatory variable to classify ships to the corresponding behavior clusters. The classifiers are developed based on both unsupervised discretization (equal width binning) and supervised discretization (Chi2). The performances of classifiers are compared by three evaluation metrics, including Average Accuracy, F1score, and AUC. We found that the classification based on multi-criteria is more accurate than using a single criterion. The classifications based on Chi2 discretization outperform the ones with equal width discretization. The outcome leads to a systematic understanding of ship behavior in a port area and can be used to predict the ship behavior pattern based on their characteristics and simulate the ship behavior.","Ship classification,Ports and waterways,Behavior clustering,Data mining,AIS data,"

"adaptive mission planning for cooperative autonomous maritime vehicles","2013","This paper addresses the problem of developing an autonomous cooperative multi-vehicle system composed of one simple low-cost unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV) guided by a more capable, sensor-equipped, surface or underwater vehicle. Specifically, in this work we consider a system composed of an autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) able to localize a small-sized UUV via a multibeam sonar and, then, to guide it via an acoustic link to reach a target. The UUV is equipped with low-cost navigation sensors (a compass and a depth sensor), and to estimate its own position relies on the data received by the ASV (range and bearing from the ASV and ASV position). This paradigm was applied in the domain of mine countermeasures (MCM) to realize the NATO CMRE Autonomous Mine Neutralization System. In this system the low-cost feature of the UUV is of the most importance since the UUV is supposed to be expendable. In this approach, however, there may be cases in which the underwater vehicle cannot be detected by the sonar for extended time periods causing drifts in the UUV position estimate, potentially compromising the mission. This paper presents a set of behaviors to address this situation. The behaviors coordinate ASV circular search patterns together with sending to the UUV purposely generated navigation updates. The aim is to limit the distance between the two vehicles, increasing the probability of sonar reacquisition, and at the same time ensuring that the UUV progresses toward the target. Results from sea trials held in Elba island (Italy) during ANT12 experiments (in June 2012) are reported, and demonstrate the approach is effective and can push our system toward full autonomy.","autonomous cooperative multivehicle system,mine countermeasures domain,low-cost navigation sensors,ANT12 experiments,multi-robot systems,control engineering computing,small-sized UUV,NATO CMRE Autonomous Mine Neutralization System,ASV position bearing,Elba island,Italy,Sonar navigation,navigation updates,Vehicles,sonar reacquisition probability,autonomous surface vehicle,Three-dimensional displays,software architecture,adaptive mission planning,autonomous underwater vehicles,simple low-cost unmanned underwater vehicle,time periods,ASV circular search patterns,compass,Sonar,vehicle distance,sensors,sonar,multibeam sonar,Acoustics,depth sensor,path planning,cooperative autonomous maritime vehicles,ASV,mobile robots,MCM domain,Sensors,ASV position range,acoustic link,sensor position estimation,"
"an overview of cawses-india program with emphasis to equatorial atmospheric coupling processes","2012","This paper presents an overview of CAWSES—India program, highlighting some of the Indian coordinated efforts to understand the Sun−Earth system as a whole, with special emphasis to the equatorial and low latitude phenomena. Two multi-institutional, multi-instrument campaigns, one under ‘Space Weather: Science and Applications’ and the other emphasizing tides under ‘Atmospheric Coupling Processes’ were conducted during February–April 2006. The highlights of the campaigns include improved prediction of equatorial spread-F (ESF) based on a ‘new factor’ combining the strength and asymmetry of the equatorial ionization anomaly (EIA); simultaneous detection of quasi-2-day wave at both E and F region heights; tomographic image showing a Traveling Ionospheric Disturbance (TID) in association with a counter electrojet (CEJ) event—all highlighting the neutral and electrodynamical coupling of the equatorial ionosphere−thermosphere regions; an unusual lowering of mesospheric temperature during a moderate geomagnetic storm—highlighting a new space weather effect; diurnal tide showing a peak amplitude of 35m/s at 45km in zonal wind and a significantly lower amplitude (∼15m/s) in the meridional wind and also evidence of convective activity in the lower atmosphere influencing the tidal variability in the Mesosphere−Lower Thermosphere (MLT) region highlighting the vertical coupling of the atmospheric regions. The development of models for equatorial and low latitude ionosphere has been among the prime activities taken up under ‘Space Climate’. Two models have been developed towards this end: one based on Second Degree (SD) relationships of F region parameters to the mean sun spot number and the other a Multiple Regression Analysis (MRA) based model involving expressions relating F region parameters to that representing solar and geomagnetic activities. The two models, intended for long and short term predictions, have been found to represent the equatorial and low latitude ionosphere over Indian longitudes better than the commonly used International Reference Ionosphere (IRI). Under the theme of ‘Solar Influence on Atmospheric Climate’, a study has been made on the effects of solar variability on middle atmosphere using satellite data and model simulations, highlighting the significant differences between them.","Ionosphere,Magnetosphere,CAWSES,Stratosphere–troposphere,Solarwind,Mesosphere,Thermosphere,"

"perturbation analysis for maritime applications","2012","Target detection of marine features is a major topic for the security and monitoring of coastlines. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) has been shown to be particularly useful because of its all-weather and night capability. In this paper a methodology based on the perturbation analysis developed by the authors is presented. The latter can be applied for detection of ships (non-marine targets) or classification of sea ice. The algorithm can be considered to be a negative filter focused on sea. Consequently, all the features which have a polarimetric behaviour different from the sea are detected and considered as targets. A complete validation with RADARSAT-2 full polarimetric data was performed in Portsmouth, UK. An accurate ground truth carried out during the acquisition, was accompanied, considering AIS GPS location and photographic evidences. Moreover, a map of the buoys helped locating this typology of targets.

"deep learning aided beam vector assignment for massive mimo maritime communication considering location information and handover impact","2022","Location aided beamforming (LAB) has been proposed as a potential solution to fast beam vector (BV) selection for massive multi-input multi-output (M-MIMO) maritime communication systems. However, the existing LAB schemes hardly consider the impact from handover. In this paper, we propose to apply the Gaussian anomaly detection (GAD) to improve the system performance, particularly in the handover zone, by exploiting the information of sea lane and locations of the user equipment (UE). Furthermore, inspired by the rationale of deep learning (DL) aided image processing methods, we first transform the BV assignment problem to a location-based artificial gray value classification problem, and then utilize a convolutional deep belief networks (CDBN) to predict the BV indices from a predefined codebook constituted by location-related feature matrices. In addition, we exploit GAD to rectify the training data of CDBN, such that the prediction on BV assignments can be more accurate to achieve a higher capacity than known methods. Finally, an extensive comparison with selected existing schemes through simulations demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.","Convolutional deep belief network (CDBN),Maritime communication,Deep learning (DL),Massive multiple input multiple output (M-MIMO),Gaussian anomaly detection (GAD),"
"vessel manoeuvring hot zone recognition and traffic analysis with ais data","2022","Automatic identification systems (AIS) are on-board compulsory devices on ships that can provide a large amount of dynamic vessel information, such as position, course and speed information, which is meaningful for marine management.

First, considering manoeuvring behaviours such as turning, acceleration and deceleration, a novel approach based on MiniBatchKMeans that recognizes ship turning hot zones, acceleration hot zones and deceleration hot zones is proposed according to course and speed variation. Second, joint probability density functions for speed over ground (SOG) and course over ground (COG) are built taking into account the combined influences of motion characteristics, which are beneficial for determining the ship traffic rules in manoeuvring hot zones and utilized in marine management. Finally, numerical and comparison experiments are conducted to test the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method.","Vessel manoeuvring,Cluster,AIS,Hot zone,Joint probability density function,"

"designing intelligent coastal surveillance based on big maritime data","2020","The ocean is classified into several territorial regimes that span from internal waters, archipelagic waters, territorial seas, contiguous zones, exclusive economic zones (EEZ), and high seas. The relevant state authorities must perform surveillance of all ships that navigate through their respective territories to ensure the ship safety and prevent them from carrying out illegal activities such as illegal unregulated and unreported (IUU) fishing, illegal firearms smuggling, and piracy. Currently, maritime domain surveillance is carried out using a combination of Automatic Identification System (AIS), Coastal Radar System (CRS), and Long Range Camera (LRC). The massive amount of incoming data from these surveillance systems produce big maritime data. However, big maritime data is useless without artificial intelligence intervention. This research proposed an intelligent system that provides and analyzes ship path planning, identifies suspicious ships, track ships, and approaches and attacks target ships using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm.

"traffic knowledge discovery from ais data","2013","Maritime Situational Awareness (i.e., an effective understanding of activities in and impacting the maritime environment) can be significantly improved by knowledge discovery of maritime traffic patterns. The recent build-up of terrestrial networks and satellite constellations of Automatic Identification System (AIS) receivers provides a rich source of cooperative vessel movement information. This vast amount of information can not be fully utilized by human operators and poses new storage and computational challenges. A compact representation of this rapidly increasing amount of information gives operational utility to data which would otherwise be ignored. This paper proposes an unsupervised and incremental learning approach to extract the historical traffic patterns from AIS data. The presented methodology called Traffic Route Extraction for Anomaly Detection (TREAD) effectively processes raw AIS data to infer different levels of contextual information, spanning from the identification of ports and off-shore platforms to spatial and temporal distributions of traffic routes. Furthermore, the accurate understanding of the historical traffic enables the classification and prediction of vessel behaviours as well as the detection of low-likelihood behaviours, or anomalies. The ultimate goal is to provide operators with a configurable knowledge framework supporting day by day decision making and general awareness of vessel pattern of life activity. The methodology is demonstrated via a real-world case study, which can be used as a reference data set for further analysis.","data mining,raw AIS data,traffic route extraction for anomaly detection,Vectors,TREAD,unsupervised learning,operational utility,maritime traffic patterns,unsupervised learning approach,incremental learning approach,low-likelihood behaviours,maritime situational awareness,automatic identification system,Knowledge discovery,marine engineering,Entropy,traffic information systems,configurable knowledge framework,traffic knowledge discovery,Trajectory,Receivers,Surveillance,Data mining,historical traffic patterns,"

"discovering maritime traffic route from ais network","2016","The recent build-up network of Automatic Identification System (AIS) equipped on vessels provides a rich source of vessel movement information. AIS is originally designed for automatically exchanging navigation information, such as their unique identification, position, course, and speed, with nearby vessels and terrestrial receivers to affect collision avoidance and safety control. The collected sequences of AIS logs can be considered as maritime trajectory data, i.e., the sequences of location points with timestamps. This vast amount of AIS trajectory data can be collected and employed to achieve an awareness of maritime traffic knowledge. This paper is devoted to discovery of maritime traffic route from trajectory data generated by AIS networks. However, AIS trajectory data discovery is a challenging task because of the trajectory data is available with uncertainty. Furthermore, unlike the vehicles' movements are constrained by road networks, there is no such a sea route for vessels to follow in marine areas. To overcome the challenges, we propose a framework of Maritime Traffic Route Discovery (abbreviated as MTRD) to generate pattern-aware routes to achieve an effective understanding of maritime traffic awareness.

"integrating inertial and satellite navigation systems to improve performance for a maritime search and rescue aircraft","2003","Inertial navigation systems (INS) are vital for airplanes, spacecraft, missiles, surface or subsurface vessels operating at sea where continuous, accurate and reliable position information, as well as heading, attitude, acceleration and velocity components of the vehicle are provided. INS have the inherent capability of being autonomous; but however, the errors in position coordinates increase unboundedly as a function of time. On the other hand, satellite navigation systems, as well as advanced radio navigation systems, which are available today and which shall be available in the near future, provide very accurate and frequently updated position information. Unfortunately, these data are prone to jamming or being lost due to the limitations of electromagnetic waves, which form the fundamental of their operation. Also, they are not usable for under-sea or under-Earth applications. To eliminate these deficiencies, INS are integrated with satellite or hyperbolic navigation systems that also obtain intermittent position information. This study gives a mathematical treatise on such an integrated system. As a feasible example, a search and rescue aircraft, involved in an expanding area search operation, equipped with strapdown INS and a Global Positioning System is simulated. The INS use two sets of acceleration and rate of rotation sensors. The model used indicates that the error in position information becomes large in time, otherwise it is limited to acceptably low levels if correction information from Global Positioning System is obtained.

On the other hand, only Radar information is not enough to get a complete description of the maritime situational picture.

"a new method for maritime traffic safety index appraisal","2011","In maritime transportation, safety during vessel's navigation at sea depends on technical and human components of the ship-system and the marine environment. The danger to the ship, on board crew and the environment continually change during the entire ship voyage due to numerous unpredictable factors. This paper proposes a new method to assess the maritime traffic safety index of the marine vessel during its journey at sea. The technology recognized as Automatic Identification System (AIS), made a compulsory fitting by the International Maritime Organization (IMO), for ships engaged in international voyages, is used to gather the information needed. This information is then transformed to obtain the various static and dynamic factor values affecting the maritime traffic safety index. Initially, identified factors are grouped under higher level factors to develop a hierarchical structure. Analytic hierarchy process is used to acquire the local weights of the factors at all the levels. Local weights are subsequently converted into normalized global weights for consideration at par. Traffic safety index of the vessel is then estimated using transformed factor values and the normalized global weights. The proposed method could be used in an online assessment of safety index and continual monitoring of variation in it. This would be helpful in the safety management of a marine vessel during its entire navigation.","analytic hierarchy process,international voyage,Safety,Marine vehicles,Monitoring,safety management,hierarchical structure,Sea measurements,ship system,ships,automatic identification system,structural engineering,marine safety,Accidents,maritime transportation,International Maritime Organization,decision making,normalized global weights,Indexes,condition monitoring,Navigation,maritime traffic safely index,marine vessel navigation,traffic,"

"beidou-based passive multistatic radar maritime moving target detection technique via spaceâ€“time hybrid integration processing","2022","This article puts forward a BeiDou-based passive multistatic radar (PMR) maritime moving target (MMT) detection technique via spaceâ€“time hybrid integration (STHI) processing. Compared with passive bistatic radar (PBR), the utilization of multiple satellites provides an improvement in MMT detection performance, together with the capabilities of localization and velocity estimation. However, the multiple satellite transmitters cause the differences principally in bistatic range and Doppler centroid (DC) of the MMT. To integrate the PMR echoes, the biggest challenge is the two differences that need to be handled. In the proposed technique, first, the centroid-compensated keystone transform (CCKT) is proposed and applied to each PBR echo. It not only corrects range cell migration (RCM) but also equalizes the DC to the same. Then, the long-time integration is performed on each PBR echo, after which it is integrated into the range-Doppler frequency rate (DFR) domain. Finally, in order to settle the difference in bistatic range, an MMT position and velocity domain (i.e., the  $X$ â€“ $Y$ â€“ $V$  domain) is constituted. The obtained multiple range-DFR maps are projected to the  $X$ â€“ $Y$ â€“ $V$  domain, and then, the effective integration of multistatic echoes can be implemented. The final STHI result allows detecting the MMT reliably. Meanwhile, according to the 3-D position where the MMT is located in the  $X$ â€“ $Y$ â€“ $V$  domain, the MMT can be localized, and its velocity can be estimated simultaneously. In May 2021, we have successfully carried out the worldâ€™s first BeiDou-based PMR MMT detection experiment, and the experimental results are given to prove the effectiveness of this technique.","Satellites,MMT position,range cell migration,marine radar,MMT detection performance,radar detection,passive radar,PBR echo,RCM,transforms,passive bistatic radar,Radio transmitters,STHI processing,BeiDou-based PMR MMT detection technique,space-time hybrid integration processing,satellite navigation,centroid-compensated keystone transform,maritime surveillance,maritime moving target (MMT) detection,object detection,BeiDou-based passive radar,spaceâ€“time hybrid integration (STHI),PMR echoes,bistatic range,Doppler effect,multistatic echoes,Doppler centroid,Satellite broadcasting,range-Doppler frequency rate domain,multiple satellite transmitters,Doppler radar,Passive radar,BeiDou-based passive multistatic radar maritime moving target detection technique,Receivers,spaceborne radar,CCKT,Multistatic radar,passive multistatic radar (PMR),radar cross-sections,range-DFR domain,multiple range-DFR maps,"
"information fusion and tracking using bernoulli filters for maritime surveillance","2022","This paper concerns the application of information fusion and Bernoulli filtering to a maritime surveillance scenario. Sensor data was recorded during live trials featuring a static Leonardo Osprey maritime surveillance active electronic scan array (AESA) radar observing a cooperative rigid inflatable boat (RIB) target deployed in the Firth of Forth estuary north of Edinburgh, UK. The RIB was equipped with a global positioning system (GPS) and an automatic identification system (AIS) recording geodetic position over time, where the collected data is fused to generate ground truth. A multi-target joint detection and tracking (MTJDT) algorithm is used to both detect and track the RIB target from post-processed radar and AIS data whilst ignoring other information regarding objects and sources of interference. Generalised optimal sub-pattern assignment (GOSPA) and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis are used to evaluate target detection, localisation, and cardinality performance quantification. Results suggest conventional data processing and the proposed tracking algorithm achieve reasonable detection and tracking performance under the assumption that the ground truth well-represents the RIB position without knowledge of error statistics, but track divergence and discontinuities occur due to radar obscuration by buildings, data inaccuracies and clutter.","maritime surveillance scenario,sensor fusion,marine radar,reasonable detection,geodetic position,multitarget joint detection,target detection,Global Positioning System,information fusion,information regarding objects,target tracking,global positioning system,image fusion,sensor data,automatic identification system,data inaccuracies,filtering theory,boats,RIB target,static Leonardo Osprey maritime surveillance active electronic scan array radar,object detection,radar interference,video recording,radar imaging,radar receivers,bernoulli filters,conventional data processing,radar tracking,clutter,radar obscuration,post processed radar,rigid inflatable boat target,video surveillance,track divergence,RIB position,AIS data,"
"moving ship optimal association for maritime surveillance: fusing ais and sentinel-2 data","2022","Nowadays, a variety of different sources can be combined together to measure and monitor maritime human activities. Reliable data fusion techniques are essential to associate the targets from different systems for maritime surveillance. In particular, the fusion of data from Sentinel-2 satellites and the automatic identification system (AIS) has attracted wide attention due to their public availability and complementarity. However, most traditional methods for target association are not suitable for this particular case, due to the time lag phenomenon of Sentinel-2 data. In this study, we first construct two new datasets for the detection of moving ships and their wakes based on Sentinel-2 images. Combined with the detection results obtained by the you only look once (YOLOv5) model, the position and course information of the detected ships are first extracted. After carefully analyzing the time lag phenomenon of Sentinel-2 data, we develop a new domain adaptation-based method for target association based on the fusion of Sentinel-2 and AIS data, called moving ship optimal association (MSOA). Different from standard domain adaptation methods only for representation alignment, the proposed MSOA is able to align representation, time, and position simultaneously. A case study is provided in which the newly proposed method is tested over the Port of Long Beach, USA. Experimental results demonstrate that both moving ships and wakes are well detected. Specifically, our newly proposed MSOA exhibits more accurate and robust performance when compared to traditional methods, and the detected ships without corresponding AIS tracks can also be detected by our MSOA. Moreover, the real sensing time and time lag of Sentinel-2 data are deduced with high accuracy. Overall, it can be concluded that our MSOA provides a new perspective for accurate target association based on heterogeneous data fusion.","surveillance,Remote sensing,sensor fusion,remote sensing,MSOA,time lag,ship detection,detected ships,heterogeneous data fusion,Marine vehicles,domain adaptation,ship optimal association,Data fusion,accurate target association,geophysical image processing,Sentinel-2 images,target tracking,Optical sensors,ships,time lag phenomenon,maritime surveillance,Target tracking,target association,you only look once (YOLO),Artificial intelligence,radar tracking,moving ships,Sentinel-2 satellites,Sensors,Surveillance,maritime surveillance (MS),domain adaptation-based method,reliable data fusion techniques,AIS data,Sentinel-2 data,"
"a framework for maritime anti-collision pattern discovery from ais network","2019","The avoidance of collisions between ships in encounter situations is crucial to maritime traffic safety. Most research on maritime collision avoidance has focused on planning a safe path by which to avoid approaching ships in accordance with the requirements laid out in the International Regulations for Preventing Collision at Sea (COLREGs). The resulting solution provides reference for the navigator in planning movements to avoid collisions. Nonetheless, specific anti-collision actions are generally based on the experience of the navigator. This study differed from existing works in that we sought to derive collision avoidance behavior from the trajectory data of actual ships. The Automatic Identification System (AIS) network makes it possible to collect an enormous volume of trajectory data and investigate real-world ship behavior. Unfortunately trajectory data that introduces uncertainty can hinder behavior mining for collision avoidance. Irregular and/or asynchronous location sampling can lead to situations in which the movement of a ship does not necessarily follow a given trajectory, even if its movement behavior is similar to that of other ships. In this study, we developed a framework to decipher the anti-collision behavior of ships in encounter situations from a large database of trajectory data collected by AIS network, and to present this behavior in the form of anti-collision patterns. A prototype of the proposed framework was built to enable pattern analysis and visualization functions, thereby providing a deeper understanding of collision avoidance behavior in maritime traffic. The proposed framework is applicable to the development of pattern-aware collision avoidance systems aimed at improving maritime traffic safety.","maritime conflict detection,real-world ship behavior,Safety,Marine vehicles,ship anti-collision pattern,pattern-aware collision avoidance systems,ship trajectory data,behavior mining,AIS network,ships,marine safety,maritime collision avoidance,Collision avoidance,Artificial intelligence,automatic identification system network,Trajectory,collision avoidance behavior,anti-collision behavior,International Regulations for Preventing Collision at Sea,maritime traffic safety,Navigation,collision avoidance,Data mining,maritime anti-collision pattern discovery,"

Major trade and energy lines pass through this ocean due to which maritime security and stability of the region are very important. To overcome these requirements, traditional as well as innovative solutions are required to be implemented. A paradigm shift is also required to enhance Regional Arrangements for Regional Disaster Response as well as Search and Rescue Operations for which role of technology in improving maritime security cannot be underestimated. This requirement rises from increasing mutual security concerns from states both in the IOR and Asia Pacific region. Technological developments are posing new threats to countries from non-state actors and causing states to mutually cooperate. As a result, emergence of these problems requires regional and global strategies for mutual cooperation. This paper presents an overview of maritime security challenges in the IOR.

"climate reconstructions for the last glacial maximum from a simple cirque glacier in fiordland, new zealand","2022","Mountain glacier records offer important constraints on the timing and magnitude of climate variability during the last glacial cycle. Existing moraine chronologies from the central Southern Alps indicate maximum ice extent was achieved during marine isotope stages 3–4, followed by repeated advances of similar, but gradually declining extent during marine isotope stage 2, until onset of the glacial termination. Questions remain over the precise role of climate in driving these changes, as most existing moraine chronologies come from large, complex former valley glacier systems, where non-climatic influences such as changing bed topography and proglacial lake formation may have influenced glacier length changes. Here we address this problem via a new cosmogenic 10Be chronology and equilibrium line altitude reconstruction from a cirque glacier situated in Fiordland, New Zealand. Our chronology shows moraine deposition at 32 ± 11 ka, 18.7 ± 0.2 ka, 18.1 ± 0.1 ka, and c. 17.2 ± 0.3 ka. The simple geometry of the former glacier supports the role of climate in driving a net decline of regional ice volume during marine isotope stages 3–2. Close spacing and good preservation of the 19–17 ka moraines permits 2D glacier reconstruction which suggests the equilibrium line altitude remained depressed by c.1130 m (equivalent to 5.8 ± 0.6 °C colder than present) during this interval. Onset of warming after 17.2 ± 0.2 ka is consistent with climate proxy evidence for a sustained southward shift in the southern westerly winds, which may have promoted deglaciation via shifting ocean currents and promoting increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide.","Glaciation,Pleistocene,Quaternary,Geomorphology,Southern pacific,Degree day modelling,Cosmogenic isotopes,Equilibrium line altitude,Paleoclimatology,Glacial,"

Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) is thus recognized as a promising technology in this case.

In this paper, we focus on the joint position-power optimization of time-shifted pilots in a maritime massive MIMO system.

"optimal auv trajectory planning and execution control for maritime pollution incident response","2021","Marine pollution incidents can have a huge impact on different ecosystems, with unpredictable short- and long-term consequences. Once the pollutant is detected, it is critical to quickly understand its characteristics so that authorities can lay out an adequate response.

A new software architecture is developed, integrating trajectory optimization for AUVs into a software toolchain that allows human operators to plan, simulate, and control multiple vehicles deployments.

However, existing models are typically limited to monostatic configurations, thus restricting their applicability in multistatic scenarios, such as GNSS-R systems.

Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellites are very useful for this, due to their capability to acquire under cloud cover and during polar nights. Additionally, polarimetry has been proven to improve the detection capability. In this work, we compare six state-of-the-art quad polarimetric detectors to test their performance and ability to detect small sized icebergs in four locations in Greenland. These were the polarimetric notch filter (PNF), polarimetric match filter (PMF), polarimetric whitening filter (PWF), optimal polarimetric detector (OPD), reflection symmetry detector, and the dual polarisation anomaly detector (iDPolRAD).

"power allocation for maritime cognitive satellite-uav-terrestrial networks","2020","In this paper, we investigate hybrid satellite-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-terrestrial networks for maritime coverage enhancement. We adopt tethered UAVs to provide aerial base station (BS) sites, and orchestrate onshore and UAV-mounted BSs in a user-centric manner. To address the spectrum scarcity problem, all available spectrum is shared among satellites, UAVs and terrestrial base stations (TBSs). This generates undesirable challenging co-channel interference (CCI) under the irregular cell-free system topology. We establish a cognitive framework to sense not only the spectrum status but also ships' position information. According to the cognitive information, user-centric virtual clusters are self organized by a group of UAVs and onshore BSs. Besides, location-dependent large-scale channel state information (CSI) can be obtained through the cognitive position information. We thus optimize the power allocation strategy with only the large-scale CSI, to further mitigate both the inter-cluster interference and leakage interference to satellite users.

"maritime coverage enhancement using uavs coordinated with hybrid satellite-terrestrial networks","2020","Due to the agile maneuverability, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have shown great promise for on-demand communications. In practice, UAV-aided aerial base stations are not separate. Instead, they rely on existing satellites/terrestrial systems for spectrum sharing and efficient backhaul. In this case, how to coordinate satellites, UAVs and terrestrial systems is still an open issue. In this paper, we deploy UAVs for coverage enhancement of a hybrid satellite-terrestrial maritime communication network. Using a typical composite channel model including both large-scale and small-scale fading, the UAV trajectory and in-flight transmit power are jointly optimized, subject to constraints on UAV kinematics, tolerable interference, backhaul, and the total energy of the UAV for communications. Different from existing studies, only the location-dependent large-scale channel state information (CSI) is assumed available, because it is difficult to obtain the small-scale CSI before takeoff in practice and the ship positions can be obtained via the dedicated maritime Automatic Identification System.

"path orthogonal matching pursuit for sparse reconstruction and denoising of swir maritime imagery","2018","We introduce an extension that may be used to augment algorithms used for the sparse decomposition of signals into a linear combination of atoms drawn from a dictionary such as those used in support of, for example, compressive sensing, k-sparse representation, and denoising. Our augmentation may be applied to any reconstruction algorithm that relies on the selection and sorting of high-correlation atoms during an analysis or identification phase by generating a 'path' between the two highest-correlation atoms. Here we investigate two types of path: a linear combination (Euclidean geodesic) and a construction relying on an optimal transport map (2-Wasserstein geodesic). We test our extension by performing image denoising and k-sparse representation using atoms from a learned overcomplete kSVD dictionary. We study the application of our techniques on SWIR imagery of maritime vessels and show that our methods outperform orthogonal matching pursuit.

"enhancing the reliability of shipborne ins/gnss integrated navigation system during abnormal sampling periods using bi-lstm and robust ckf","2023","Developing a reliable navigation system is a crucial challenge for intelligent ships. Integrating Inertial Navigation Systems (INS) with shipborne Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) provides a viable solution. However, the system's reliability heavily relies on GNSS availability. This paper proposes a method to enhance the reliability of shipborne INS/GNSS integrated navigation systems during GNSS abnormal sampling periods. The proposed method consists of two parts. Firstly, using specially designed input and output parameters, a pseudo-GNSS prediction model based on a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network (Bi-LSTM) is constructed to generate predicted pseudo-GNSS measurements during periods of GNSS loss, effectively filling in the gaps left by the absence of actual GNSS data. Secondly, Huber's M-estimation-based Robust Cubature Kalman filter (RCKF) is integrated into the data fusion algorithm, and a switching mechanism between RCKF and the Cubature Kalman filter (CKF) is established based on the source of GNSS data utilized for measurement update, to mitigate the impact of non-Gaussian distribution prediction noise introduced by pseudo-GNSS prediction model. Experimental validation using real ship navigation data in a natural marine environment confirms the proposed method's capability to maintain navigation accuracy during GNSS loss for shipborne INS/GNSS integrated navigation systems. The algorithm's superiority becomes more evident as the duration of GNSS loss increases, underscoring its effectiveness in enhancing shipborne integrated navigation system reliability.","Bi-LSTM,Intelligent ship,GNSS loss,Robust CKF,Navigation reliability,Ship integrated navigation,"
"infrared maritime target detection based on iterative corner and edge weights in tensor decomposition","2023","High-precision infrared maritime target detection plays an important role in early warning, monitoring, search, and rescue. The methods of decomposing the original image into low-rank background components and sparse target components show favorable detection performance. However, the strong edge interference is also sparse and may be mistakenly taken as target components, resulting in a large number of false alarms and reducing detection accuracy. To solve the problem, we propose an iterative corner and edge weights method based on tensor decomposition. The original image is decomposed into the background component, target component, and additional strong edge interference component. The corner strength is designed as the weight of the target component, and the edge strength is designed as the weight of the interference component in order to separate the target and interference more accurately. And the two weights are designed to be updated during each iteration of the model solution to reduce the impact of initial imprecise weights on detection results. Compared with 8 advanced baseline methods in 10 datasets, the proposed method demonstrates outstanding results and shows engineering application prospects.","Image edge detection,maritime target detection,iterative corner,edge weights method,background component,edge strength,Solid modeling,edge detection,tensors,interference suppression,detection accuracy reduction,target component,initial imprecise weights,corner strength,false alarms,object detection,Infrared small target detection,low-rank background components,tensor decomposition,iterative weight,sparse target components,Tensors,Iterative methods,Object detection,Interference,favorable detection performance,strong edge interference component,Analytical models,"

"inferences on gas transport based on molecular and isotopic signatures of gases at acoustic chimneys and background sites in the ulleung basin","2012","We present results of a comparative study of hydrocarbons collected at acoustic chimney sites and nearby non-chimney (background) sites in the Ulleung Basin (offshore Korea). At all sites, molecular (C1/C2+ ratios⩾600) and isotopic (δ13CCH4, δDCH4 and δ13CC2H6) indicators point to a microbial source of methane and ethane. Similarly, at all sites the δ13CCH4 and δ13CCO2 have minimum values at the sulfate–methane transition zone (SMTZ) throughout the basin. These data document intense carbon cycling at this horizon, whereby anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) at the SMTZ generates a dissolved inorganic carbon pool depleted in 13C that is subsequently reduced to generate the observed minima in δ13CCH4. At the background sites, the carbon isotope fractionation factor (εc=δ13CCO2−δ13CCH4) for all gases ranges from 56–66, consistent with values predicted for methanogenesis driven predominantly by microbial CO2 reduction. However, εc values measured in the two acoustic chimney sites that contain gas hydrate are significantly lower (30–46). We conclude that these abnormally small εc values reflect two phase fluid transport at gas hydrate bearing sites. The composition of the hydrocarbons sampled below the SMTZ at these sites (higher C2+ abundance and δ13C enriched methane) indicates a deep source origin for the microbial gas, which we postulate migrates upwardly and sustains the gas hydrate formation near the seafloor. If so, abnormally small εc values can be used as a potential geochemical indicator for the migration of methane in the gas phase and the consequent development of gas hydrate accumulations in shallow marine systems.",""

"the significance of spectral position in the rhodopsins of tropical marine fishes","1973","Visual pigments were extracted from the retinae of a large and diverse sample (179 species, in 40 families) of tropical marinefishes. By the method of partial bleaching, most of these were found to be retinal-1 pigments, with their maxima tightly grouped between 489 and 502 nm; but a few have λmax at shorter wavelengths. The spectral position of these pigments does not correlate with diurnal or nocturnal activity patterns, nor do closely related species necessarily have similar pigments. In general, the deeper-living species have rhodopsins with λmax at shorter wavelengths, a correlation with the bluer quality of light in deeper water. The spectral distribution of light was measured in air and underwater at a coral atoll. During twilight the underwater spectrum narrows and shifts to shorter wavelengths, as a result of increased absorption of yellow-orange light by the atmosphere. This effect at twilight is unique among the general spectral events that constitute each day. The behavioral patterns of reef fishes make clear the relationships between underwater light and the visual pigments. During evening twilight, there is an orderly sequence, in which the diurnal fishes seek cover, and then, after a “Quiet Period”, the nocturnal species emerge. The “Quiet Period” is the most critical and visually difficult time because light intensities are transitional between the thresholds of photopic and scotopic vision. Predation reaches a maximum during the “Quiet Period”. The rhodopsins of all these fishes tend to match the background light available during evening and morning twilight. Photochemically, visual sensitivity is maximized and, as a result, predation is held in check. The relationships between light, behavior and visual physiology are discussed. Although their rhodopsins are spectrally similar to those of the prey, crepuscular predators obtain a visual advantage by having moderate numbers of very large cones, which provide adequate sensitivity and sufficient resolution for motion detection.

"striking similarities in temporal changes to spring sea ice occurrence across the central canadian arctic archipelago over the last 7000 years","2010","A 7000 year spring sea ice record for Victoria Strait (ARC-4) and Dease Strait (ARC-5) in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago (CAA) has been determined by quantification of the sea ice diatom-derived biomarker IP25 in two marine sediment piston cores obtained in 2005. The chronologies of the ARC-4 and ARC-5 cores were determined using a combination of 14C AMS dates obtained from macrobenthic fossils and magnetic susceptibility measurements. The ages of the tops of the piston cores were estimated by matching chemical and physical parameters with those obtained from corresponding box cores. These analyses revealed that, while the top of the ARC-4 piston core was estimated to be essentially modern (ca. 60 cal yr BP), a few hundred years of sediment appeared to be absent from the ARC-5 piston core. Downcore changes to IP25 fluxes for both cores were interpreted in terms of variations in spring sea ice occurrence, and correlations between the individual IP25 flux profiles for Victoria Strait, Dease Strait and Barrow Strait (reported previously) were shown to be statistically significant at both 50 and 100-year resolutions. The IP25 data indicate lower spring sea ice occurrences during the early part of the record (ca. 7.0–3.0 cal kyr BP) and for parts of the late Holocene (ca. 1.5–0.8 cal kyr BP), especially for the two lower latitude study locations. In contrast, higher spring sea ice occurrences existed during ca. 3.0–1.5 cal kyr BP and after ca. 800 cal yr BP. The observation of, consecutively, lower and higher spring sea ice occurrence during two periods of the late Holocene, coincides broadly with the Medieval Warm Period and Little Ice Age epochs, respectively. The IP25 data are complemented by particle size and mineralogical data, although these may alternatively reflect changes in sea level at the study sites. The IP25 data are also compared to previous proxy-based determinations of palaeo sea ice and palaeoclimate for the CAA, including those based on bowhead whale remains and dinocyst assemblages. The spatial consistency in the proxy data which, most notably, indicates an increase in spring sea ice occurrence around 3 cal kyr BP, provides a potentially useful benchmark for the termination of the Holocene Thermal Maximum for the central CAA.",""
"ais-based evaluation of target detectors and sar sensors characteristics for maritime surveillance","2015","This paper studies the performances of different ship detectors based on adaptive threshold algorithms. The detection algorithms are based on various clutter distributions and assessed automatically with a systematic methodology.

Depending on the datasets used for testing, the detection algorithms offer different advantages and disadvantages. The systematic method used in discriminating real detected targets and false alarms in order to determine the detection rate, allows us to perform an appropriate and consistent comparison of the detectors.

"predictive control of container flows in maritime intermodal terminals","2013","Predictive control is investigated as a paradigm for the allocation of handling resources to transfer containers inside intermodal terminals. The decisions on the allocation of such resources are derived from the minimization of performance cost functions that measure the lay times of carriers over a forward horizon basing on a model of the container flows. Such a model allows one to take advantage of the information available in real time on the arrival or departure of carriers with the corresponding amounts of containers scheduled for loading or unloading. The resulting strategy of resource allocation can be regarded as a feedback control law and is obtained by solving nonlinear programming problems online. Since the computation may be too expensive, a technique based on the idea of approximating offline such a law is proposed. The approximation is performed by using neural networks, which allow one to construct an approximate feedback controller and generate the corresponding online control actions with a negligible computational burden. The effectiveness of the approach is shown via simulations in a case study.","feedback,container flows,resource allocation handling,Mathematical model,neural networks,Resource management,transfer containers,online control actions,neurocontrollers,Least squares approximation,forward horizon,Loading,predictive control,feedback control law,Containers,containers,nonlinear programming,freight handling,Container terminal management,maritime intermodal terminals,feedback controller,Predictive control,resource allocation,performance cost functions,"

To guarantee fairness, we aim to maximize the minimum expected throughput overall ships by jointly optimizing the trajectory and communication resource allocation, subject to the constraints of the USV kinetics, safe sailing, breakpoint distances, line-of-sight links, resource allocation, and information-causality.

"satellite cns for maritime transportation augmentation system (mtas)","2009","The development of the MTAS was to identify the possible applications for enhancement of digital selective call (DCS) MF/HF/VHF radio; satellite communications, navigation and surveillance (CNS); GPS and GLONASS; and safety systems including security and control of vessels, logistic and freight at sea, on inland waters and the security of crew and passengers on board ships, cruisers, boats and hovercrafts. These enhancements include many applications for the better management and operation of vessels and they are needed more than ever because of world merchant fleet expansion. Just the top 20 world ships registers have about 40,000 units under their national flags. Above all, the biggest problem today is that merchant ships and their crews are targets of the types of crime traditionally associated with the maritime industries, such as piracy, robbery and recently, a target for terrorist attacks. Thus, IMO and flag states will have a vital role in developing International Ship and Port Security (ISPS). The best way to implement ISPS is to design an Approaching and Port Control System (APCS) by special code augmentation satellite CNS including tracking and monitoring of all vehicle circulation in and out of the port area. The establishment of MTAS as a part of Global Satellite Augmentation Systems (GSAS) or GNSS-1, such as the US WAAS, European EGNOS, Japanese MSAS, Chinese SNAS, Indian GAGAN and future GSAS including African Satellite Augmentation System (ASAS) will meet all these requirements and will complement the services already provided by DGPS or Local VHF Augmentation System (LVAS) and MF radio beacons.","satellite CNS,MTAS,APCS,port area,Satellite navigation systems,Transportation,hovercrafts,US WAAS,Communication system security,GLONASS,GSAS,ISPS,Marine vehicles,Global Positioning System,European EGNOS,navigation and surveillance,Radio navigation,African satellite augmentation system,Satellite communication,crew security,marine safety,satellite navigation,cruisers,maritime transportation augmentation system,International Ship and Port Security,boats,Distributed control,Chinese SNAS,GPS,Satellite broadcasting,GNSS-1,safety systems,world merchant fleet expansion,Indian GAGAN,satellite communications,mobile satellite communication,Global Satellite Augmentation Systems,marine communication,Approaching and Port Control System,Control systems,board ships,terrorist attacks,special code augmentation satellite CNS,marine vehicles,Japanese MSAS,local VHF augmentation system,MF radio beacons,digital selective call,"
"data-driven trajectory quality improvement for promoting intelligent vessel traffic services in 6g-enabled maritime iot systems","2021","Future generation communication systems, such as 5G and 6G wireless systems, exploit the combined satellite-terrestrial communication infrastructures to extend network coverage and data throughput for data-driven applications. These ground-breaking techniques have promoted the rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT) in maritime industries. In maritime IoT applications, intelligent vessel traffic services can be guaranteed by collecting and analyzing high volume of spatial data flows from automatic identification system (AIS). This AIS system includes a highly integrated automatic equipment, including functionalities of core communication, tracking, and sensing. The increased utilization of shipboard AIS devices allows the collection of massive trajectory data. However, the received raw AIS data often suffers from undesirable outliers (i.e., poorly tracked timestamped points for vessel trajectories) during signal acquisition and analog-to-digital conversion. The degraded AIS data will bring negative effects on vessel traffic services (e.g., maritime traffic monitoring, intelligent maritime navigation, vessel collision avoidance, etc.) in maritime IoT scenarios. To improve the quality of vessel trajectory records from AIS networks, we propose to develop a two-phase data-driven machine learning framework for vessel trajectory reconstruction. In particular, a density-based clustering method is introduced in the first phase to automatically recognize the undesirable outliers. The second phase proposes a bidirectional long short-term memory (BLSTM)-based supervised learning technique to restore the timestamped points degraded by random outliers in vessel trajectories. Comprehensive experiments on simulated and realistic data sets have verified the dominance of our two-phase vessel reconstruction framework compared to other competing methods. It thus has the capacity of promoting intelligent vessel traffic services in 6G-enabled maritime IoT systems.","short-term memory-based supervised learning technique,maritime traffic monitoring,recurrent neural nets,supervised learning technique,intelligent maritime navigation,data-driven applications,AIS networks,Internet of Things,Monitoring,neural networks,6G-enabled maritime IoT systems,vessel collision avoidance,time stamped point restoration,shipboard AIS devices,BLSTM,two-phase vessel reconstruction framework,spatial data,5G mobile communication,automatic identification system,maritime IoT applications,supervised learning,vessel traffic services,signal reconstruction,intelligent vessel traffic services,6G mobile communication,pattern clustering,vessel trajectories,Artificial intelligence,analogue-digital conversion,two-phase data-driven machine,raw AIS data system,telecommunication traffic,maritime Internet of Things (IoT),6G wireless systems,integrated automatic equipment,Trajectory,signal detection,vessel trajectory reconstruction,marine communication,automatic identification system (AIS),Navigation,maritime industries,bidirectional long short-term memory,combined satellite-terrestrial communication,data-driven trajectory quality improvement,massive trajectory data,future generation communication systems,"

"application of the jpda-ukf to hfsw radars for maritime situational awareness","2012","At the present day, growing interest is paid to the development of more reliable surveillance systems for maritime situational awareness (MSA). The purpose is to detect, track and classify cooperative and non-cooperative targets. For this reason, great interest is given to low-power/cost High-Frequency Surface-Wave (HFSW) radars as an early-warning tool for over-the-horizon (OTH) applications. However, in HFSW radars there is a trade-off in terms of quality and cost, i.e. the radar system exhibits poor azimuth resolution, high non-linearity, and significant false alarm rate. All these aspects reduce tracking performance if not properly addressed. In this context, the Joint Probabilistic Data Association (JPDA) with the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) is proposed. The tracking algorithm behavior is investigated by a comparison between the tracks generated by two HFSW radars, with overlapped fields of view, and Automatic Identification System (AIS) data.

"mimo unmanned surface vessels enabled maritime wireless network coexisting with satellite network: beamforming and trajectory design","2023","Due to the flexible deployment, unmanned surface vessels (USVs) have attracted much interest recently. To solve the resource scarcity problem at sea, USV needs to leverage existing terrestrial and satellite systems for efficient backhaul and spectrum sharing. In this case, the multiple input multiple output (MIMO) technology can be applied for diversity gain improvement and interference coordination. However, how to adopt MIMO technology into maritime networks with a sparse scattering environment is still an open issue. In this paper, we employ a multi-antenna USV to support on-demand communications. Utilizing the two-ray channel, we aim to maximize the sum throughput over all USV intended users, by jointly optimizing the cooperative beamforming and trajectory, subject to several practical constraints, including the USV kinetics, quality of service requirement and backhaul capacity. Different from existing whole period designs, we decompose the problem into sequential one-slot problems.

"a general orthogonal transform aided mimo design for reliable maritime visible light communications","2020","In maritime visible light communication (VLC) systems, user information is delivered among different terminals distributed in the atmosphere, and the underwater environment. To combat the complex and variant marine channel conditions induced by the absorption, scattering, and turbulence influence, in this article, we propose a general orthogonal transform (OT) aided multiple input multiple output (MIMO) transmission scheme to enhance the transmission reliability performances. In our design, we propose to construct the orthogonal transform matrix recursively with the Hadamard matrix. Thus we could exploit the repetitive property of the elements in the orthogonal matrix to enlarge the Euclidean distances among the signals. Moreover, the value of the elements could be adjusted dynamically to adapt to time-changing channel conditions. Thanks to the orthogonality of the matrix, and the singular value decomposition (SVD), the interferences among signals could be effectively suppressed. Accordingly, the reliability performances can be improved. Furthermore, we derive the theoretical symbol error rate (SER) expressions for the proposed design. Numerical simulations are performed to validate the theoretical analysis. Furthermore, the SER performances with different water types, and wind speeds in various scenarios of the atmosphere, underwater, and air-water interface channels are investigated, and compared with the counterpart systems.","telecommunication network reliability,multiple input multiple output transmission scheme,underwater environment,Reliability engineering,user information,transmission reliability performances,Visible light communication,maritime visible light communication systems,matrix algebra,singular value decomposition,variant marine channel conditions,reliability,multiple input multiple output,Matrix decomposition,turbulence influence,free-space optical communication,Scattering,orthogonal transform aided MIMO design,Reliability theory,error statistics,Euclidean distances,orthogonal transform matrix,maritime visible light communication,wireless channels,symbol error rate expressions,reliable maritime visible light communications,SER performances,Hadamard matrix,marine communication,complex marine channel conditions,orthogonal transform,Air and underwater channels,MIMO communication,Transforms,air-water interface channels,"
"a single-carrier delay-and-superposition based high spectral efficiency differential chaos shift keying for maritime internet of vessels","2022","The fast growing Internet of Vessels (IoV) requires maritime communications to be more spectral efficient to make full use of the scarce maritime spectral resource, provide a high data transmission rate and support massive communication nodes to access the network. However, the spectral efficiency of most existing maritime communications are still relatively low, and consequently maritime communications can hardly support high volume multi-user communications. Therefore, in this paper, a high spectral efficiency Differential Chaos Shift Keying system based on a single-carrier delay-and-superposition modulation technology (SCDS-DCSK) is proposed for IoV scenarios. In a SCDS-DCSK symbol, all sub-carriers have the same frequency, indicating that the symbol of SCDS-DCSK only occupies the bandwidth of a single sub-channel. As a result, a large amount of maritime communication resources can be saved for accommodating more communication nodes and the spectral efficiency is significantly improved. System architectures and principles are firstly demonstrated. Then, the spectral efficiency, peak mean power ratio (PAPR), complexity, and the origin of error bits of SCDS-DCSK are analyzed, and the bit-error-rate expressions are derived. Moreover, effects of various system parameters and levels of sea states on the system performance are simulated and discussed. Simulation results verify the theoretical analyses, and manifest that the SCDS-DCSK can achieve a high spectral efficiency under various sea states. Thanks to characteristics such as high spectral efficiency, flexible parameter configuration, and simple implementation, SCDS-DCSK is a promising technology for improving the quality of service (QoS) of future maritime IoV.","single-carrier delay-and-superposition,peak mean power ratio,QoS,quality of service,SCDS-DCSK symbol,PAPR,modulation,future maritime IoV,Vessels,chaos,maritime communication resources,error statistics,Maritime communications,spectral efficiency,single subchannel,single carrier delay,Modulation,superposition modulation technology,Sea state,fast growing Internet,support massive communication nodes,chaotic communication,consequently maritime communications,Frequency modulation,high data transmission rate,Symbols,high volume multiuser communications,Chaotic communication,marine communication,maritime Internet of Vessels,Spectral efficiency,Internet of Vessels (IoV),Internet,scarce maritime spectral resource,high spectral efficiency differential chaos shift keying system,maritime communications,"
"moving baseline localization for multi-vehicle maritime operations","2017","Development in autonomous systems in recent years have enabled an increase on multi-vehicle maritime operations. Air, surface and underwater vehicles are now able to cooperate to jointly accomplish the objectives of a shared mission plan. In multi-vehicle scenarios, knowing accurately the platforms position is of great importance. If the navigation error is not controlled, unexpected and undesirable events such as collisions, less reliable data or loss of platforms can occur. In environments where Global Positioning System (GPS) is denied, such as underwater, updating the global position for the platform is difficult and often requires taking specific actions which are not part of the original mission. In the underwater domain, this typically means getting a GPS fix on the surface. Breaching the surface is a time consuming and potentially dangerous or unfeasible task. In this paper a framework striving to reduce or even completely remove the need for an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) to surface for GPS fix is described.

Based on that, the resource allocation is jointly optimized for all users over all time slots during the voyage, which is a mixed 0-1 non-convex programming problem. We transform this problem into a convex one by means of variable substitution and time-sharing relaxation, and propose an iterative algorithm to solve it based on the Lagrangian dual decomposition method.

"insights and guidance for offshore co2 storage monitoring based on the qics, eti mmv, and stemm-ccs projects","2020","Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is a collective term for technologies that allow society to unlock the benefits of energy intensive processes like fertiliser production and combustion of fuels (fossil or biologically sourced) without releasing the CO2 to the atmosphere.

This paper aims to summarise the learnings of three research projects that all investigated aspects of marine monitoring for CCS from a CO2 storage operator’s perspective. The QICS (Quantifying and Monitoring Potential Ecosystem Impacts of Geological Carbon Storage), ETI MMV (Energy Technologies Institute Measurement, Monitoring and Verification of CO2 Storage), and STEMM-CCS (Strategies for Environmental Monitoring of Marine CCS) projects collectively represent over twelve years of dedicated research to assess environmental impacts and to develop technologies for detection, location, and quantification of potential leakage from offshore geological storage of CO2. Each project used controlled releases in representative environments to test their methods and technologies. QICS as the first of the three projects, focused on the understanding of sensitivities of the UK marine environment to a potential leak from a CO2 storage complex and tested technologies to detect such emissions. The ETI MMV project brought together research and industry partners to develop and sea trial an operational, integrated and cost-effective marine monitoring system for geological CO2 storage. As a commercial project, these results have never been published before and this paper shares for the first-time insights from this work. In February 2020, STEMM-CCS, completed its quest to test techniques for environmental monitoring over a marine CO2 storage site in the UK North Sea, further improved near seabed leakage characterisation capabilities, and delivered a first marine CCS demonstration level ecological baseline. This paper aims to summarise some of the key insights from the three projects and provides references where available for the interested reader. The key finding of all three projects is that the impacts of small to medium CO2 leakages from large-scale storage are limited and localised. Technology capabilities exist for integrated marine CO2 storage monitoring and their performance has been benchmarked at controlled release trials. Even small leakages of 10−50 L/min can be detected at unknown locations in a large area of interest. Finally, the first important steps towards automated monitoring data analysis have been made, including automated leakage signal detection from Side Scan Sonar data (ETI MMV project) and automated species identification from marine biology images (STEMM-CCS project). Some remaining challenges include missed/false alerts because of large variations in the background signal, the cost of monitoring large areas over long periods, and making real-time decisions based on big data. Continued work to reduce the cost of marine monitoring technologies and advancing automation of data processing and analysis will be important in order to support safe and efficient offshore CCS deployment at large scale.","CCS,Location,Offshore CO2 storage,Regulation,Impact assessment,Quantification,Monitoring,Verification,Detection,Attribution,"
"low-cost, intelligent drifter fleet for large-scale, distributed ocean observation","2022","We have developed Persistent Environmental Awareness Reporting and Location (PEARL) ocean drifters. PEARL drifters are small, rugged, low-cost, autonomous, environmentally friendly ocean drifters that represent a significant opportunity for high-impact applications in both national security and environmental ecosystem monitoring. Drifters record and report data which is processed by advanced edge analytics before being compressed for satellite transmission to populate a large data repository with sensor data that is combined and analyzed to discover signals of interest in the ocean environment with the goal of increasing distributed maritime awareness. Each drifter is entirely self-contained, powered by solar panels and backup batteries, with a large array of sensors, compute module for onboard data processing, and satellite modem for data reporting. The drifter architecture is flexible and can be customized for a specific purpose. The complete data record is stored locally and processed by the onboard compute module, which runs anomaly detection algorithms that detect nearby activity. Anomalous events, as well as baseline environmental data, are reported to a cloud database using satellite short burst data transmission. Though each independent drifter is a powerful sensing tool, the low unit cost permits large scale deployment. To date thousands of drifters have been deployed over vast areas of the ocean and are reporting data to a remote database where cloud-based analytics algorithms develop global situational awareness and update local edge algorithms on the drifters based on learnings across the full network.","Satellites,data reporting,remote sensing,distributed ocean observation,complete data record,environmental ecosystem monitoring,Location ocean drifters,lagrangian drifter,intelligent drifter fleet,high-impact applications,anomaly detection,maritime domain awareness,drifter architecture,Persistent Environmental Awareness Reporting,Distributed databases,environmental data,vessel tracking,satellite communication,marine systems,Turning,oceanographic equipment,sensor data,advanced edge analytics,onboard compute module,cloud computing,ocean circulation,baseline environmental data,satellite transmission,Oceans,geophysics computing,data reduction,ocean environment,maritime awareness,satellite modem,data repository,edge processing,PEARL drifters,oceanographic regions,onboard data processing,Roads,cloud-edge algorithms,Cloud computing,national security,satellite short burst data transmission,Sensors,environmentally friendly ocean drifters,oceanographic techniques,"
"the lsts software toolchain for persistent maritime operations applied through vehicular ad-hoc networks","2017","In order to further expand the sustainability of maritime operations the use of autonomous vehicles has been employed at an increasing scale. This natural increase comes not only in the form of the multiplication of the numbers of the same vehicle model, but also in diversifying the vehicle composition setup in order to allow the exploitation of different types of payloads. Moreover, this use of heterogeneous multi-vehicle teams allows overcoming individual limitations that one specific vehicle model might have. Nevertheless, this increase in scale and functionality also causes an increase in control, management, and spatial and operational complexity. This complexity is addressed in the framework of the LSTS Neptus-IMC-Dune software toolchain. The software toolchain is a framework for mixed-initiative control (humans in the planning and control loops) of unmanned ocean and air vehicles operating in communications challenged environments with support for Disruptive Tolerant Networking (DTN) protocols. The use of such a toolchain has allowed for repeated and successful deployments of heterogeneous multi-vehicle teams.

"rainwater runoff retention on an aged intensive green roof","2013","Urban areas are characterised by large proportions of impervious surfaces which increases rainwater runoff and the potential for surface water flooding. Increased precipitation is predicted under current climate change projections, which will put further pressure on urban populations and infrastructure. Roof greening can be used within flood mitigation schemes to restore the urban hydrological balance of cities. Intensive green roofs, with their deeper substrates and higher plant biomass, are able to retain greater quantities of runoff, and there is a need for more studies on this less common type of green roof which also investigate the effect of factors such as age and vegetation composition. Runoff quantities from an aged intensive green roof in Manchester, UK, were analysed for 69 rainfall events, and compared to those on an adjacent paved roof. Average retention was 65.7% on the green roof and 33.6% on the bare roof. A comprehensive soil classification revealed the substrate, a mineral soil, to be in good general condition and also high in organic matter content which can increase the water holding capacity of soils. Large variation in the retention data made the use of predictive regression models unfeasible. This variation arose from complex interactions between Antecedant Dry Weather Period (ADWP), season, monthly weather trends, and rainfall duration, quantity and peak intensity. However, significantly lower retention was seen for high rainfall events, and in autumn, which had above average rainfall. The study period only covers one unusually wet year, so a longer study may uncover relationships to factors which can be applied to intensive roofs elsewhere. Annual rainfall retention for Manchester city centre could be increased by 2.3% by a 10% increase in intensive green roof construction. The results of this study will be of particular interest to practitioners implementing greenspace adaptation in temperate and cool maritime climates.","Rainwater runoff,Green roof,Sustainable urban drainage systems,"
"upper paleozoic mafic and intermediate volcanic rocks of the mount pleasant caldera associated with the sn–w deposit in southwestern new brunswick (canada): petrogenesis and metallogenic implications","2016","Upper Paleozoic (~365Ma) mafic and intermediate volcanic rocks of the Piskahegan Group constitute a subordinate part of the Mount Pleasant caldera, which is associated with a significant polymetallic deposit (tungsten–molybdenum–bismuth zones ~33Mt ore with 0.21% W, 0.1% Mo and 0.08% Bi and tin–indium zones ~4.8Mt with 0.82% Sn and 129g/t In) in southwestern New Brunswick (Canada). The epicontinental caldera complex formed during the opening of the late Paleozoic Maritimes Basin in the northern Appalachians. The mafic and intermediate rocks make up two compositionally distinct associations. The first association includes evolved rift-related continental tholeiitic basalts, and the second association comprises calc-alkaline andesites, although both associations were emplaced penecontemporaneously. The basalts have low Mg#~0.34–0.40, smooth chondrite-normalized REE patterns with (La/Yb)n~5–6, primitive mantle-normalized trace element patterns without noticeable negative Nb–Ta anomalies, and their ɛNd(T) ranges from +2.5 to +2.2. The basalts were generated by partial melting of a transition zone between spinel and garnet mantle peridotite at a depth of ~70–90km. The calc-alkaline andesites of the second association have chondrite-normalized REE patterns that are more fractionated, with (La/Yb)n~7–8.5, but without significant negative Eu anomalies. Compared to the basaltic rocks, they have lower ɛNd(T) values, ranging from +0.5 to +1.9, and their mantle-normalized trace element plots show negative Nb–Ta anomalies. The ɛNd(T) values display negative correlations with indicators of crustal contamination, such as Th/La, Th/Nb and SiO2. The andesitic rocks are interpreted to have formed by assimilation–fractional crystallization processes, which resulted in the contamination of a precursor basaltic magma with crustal material. The parent basaltic magma for both suites underwent a different evolution. The tholeiitic basalts experienced shallow-seated fractional crystallization and evolved along a tholeiitic trend of “early iron” enrichment (non-oxic conditions). The contaminated magma of the second association followed a calc-alkaline fractionation trend of “no iron” enrichment (oxidizing conditions) characterized by a high PH2O and PO2 environment at the mid-crust levels. The Piskahegan Group, which is associated with an important polymetallic mineral deposit, differs from the numerous non-mineralized rift-related volcanic suites of the regional Upper Devonian to Lower Carboniferous successions in the Maritimes Basin by the presence of a significant amount of coeval calc-alkaline andesite, which may be an indicator of potential mineralization.","Petrogenesis,Devonian,Sn–W deposit,Crustal contamination,Bimodal volcanic rocks,"

A 5-year archive of vessel position data covering the period characterized by the highest number of attacks and the subsequent decline provides a unique source for data-driven statistical analysis that highlights changes in routing and sailing speeds. The work, besides demonstrating the value of LRIT data for statistical maritime traffic analysis, can be used to ultimately provide quantitative support to the estimates of the additional fuel consumption due to piracy.

"exploring ais data for intelligent maritime routes extraction","2020","Maritime traffic route is the basis for the analysis of ship traffic characteristics and navigation safety. However, the spatial freedom of ship navigation makes the extraction of maritime traffic route a challenging task. In order to realize the extraction of ship traffic routes at sea, a maritime route extraction method based on ship history automatic identification system (AIS) data is proposed. In this method, the ship trajectory with rich position information is transformed into a ship trip semantic object (STSO) with semantic information, and each ship trip is abstracted as a “stop-waypoint-stop” trip object. In addition, based on the graph theory, the STSO is further integrated into the nodes and edges of a directed maritime traffic graph to realize the extraction and expression of the shipping routes. In order to prove the effectiveness of this method, the real-world AIS historical data are used for testing, and the results show that this method can effectively extract maritime traffic routes.","Automatic Identification System (AIS),Semantic trajectory,Shipping route,Maritime traffic,Graph theory,"

"the aleutian low, storm tracks, and winter climate variability in the bering sea","2007","Previous studies have found inconsistent results regarding how wintertime conditions in the Bering Sea relate to variations in the North Pacific climate system. This problem is addressed through analysis of data from the NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis for the period 1950–2003. Composite patterns of sea-level pressure, 500hPa geopotential heights, storm tracks and surface air temperature are presented for four situations: periods of strong Aleutian Low, weak Aleutian Low, warm Bering Sea air temperatures, and cold Bering Sea air temperatures. Winter temperatures in the Bering Sea are only marginally related to the strength of the Aleutian Low, and are much more sensitive to the position of the Aleutian Low and to variations in storm tracks. In particular, relatively warm temperatures are associated with either an enhanced storm track off the coast of Siberia, and hence anomalous southerly low-level flow, or an enhanced storm track entering the eastern Bering Sea from the southeast. These latter storms do not systematically affect the mean meridional winds, but rather serve to transport mild air of maritime origin over the Bering Sea. The leading indices for the North Pacific, such as the NP and PNA, are more representative of the patterns of tropospheric circulation and storm track anomalies associated with the strength of the Aleutian Low than patterns associated with warm and cold wintertime conditions in the Bering Sea.","Aleutian Low,Winds,Storm tracks,North Pacific,Bering Sea,Climate variability,"
"a bernoulli track-before-detect filter for interacting targets in maritime radar","2021","This article is devoted to the problem of multitarget tracking in the maritime environment using Bernoulli track-before-detect (TBD) filtering. Detection and tracking of weak targets in sea clutter using high-resolution airborne radar is notoriously challenging compared to classical target tracking problems. Furthermore, the measured amplitude in range-azimuth cells that are in the vicinity of closely spaced (interacting) targets represents a superposition of individual target contributions, demanding a special joint treatment. This article proposes a novel solution for multitarget tracking using Bernoulli TBD for maritime radar and covers cases when targets are both far apart and closely spaced. Comparisons with existing TBD algorithms are used to verify the efficacy of the proposed Bernoulli TBD algorithm with realistic sea clutter simulations used to create challenging scenarios with variable target strengths.","airborne radar,track before detect (TBD),existing TBD algorithms,radar detection,Maritime radar,radar clutter,high-resolution airborne radar,sea clutter,Sea measurements,weak targets,interacting targets,Noise measurement,Radio frequency,multitarget tracking,Bernoulli track-before-detect filtering,target tracking,filtering theory,Target tracking,object detection,closely spaced targets,Radar tracking,range-azimuth cells,Radar,interacting,radar tracking,maritime environment,individual target contributions,variable target strengths,Clutter,realistic sea clutter simulations,classical target tracking problems,Bernoulli track-before-detect filter,Bernoulli TBD algorithm,maritime radar,"

"geochemical and stable isotopic variability within two rivers rising under the same mountain, but belonging to two distant watersheds","2013","Complementary geochemical and stable isotope investigations of the Gorski Kotar karst aquifer system in western Croatia were obtained for the first time, to answer the question whether both studied rivers drain the same aquifer system or not. The two main rivers, the Kupa and the Rječina, rise under the same mountain range, but belong to two different watersheds (Black Sea and Adriatic Sea). The karst aquifer of Gorski Kotar is a potentially important source of drinking water for two neighboring countries, Croatia and Slovenia (Central and South Europe), and is strongly influenced by both Mediterranean and continental weather conditions. It is a part of the Dinaric karst, which is “locus typicus” for karst worldwide and one of the most typical karst areas in the world. To answer the main question of our research, baseline data were thoroughly collected comprising stable isotopes, concentration of dissolved and total trace metals in water, and multi-elemental analyses of river sediments, together with other physical-chemical parameters (pH, dissolved oxygen, electric conductivity and temperature). Total dissolved solid (TDS) was not measured but estimated as (EC) 0.67. Such multi-technique approach was applied for the first time in the Dinaric karst systems. Multi-elemental analysis of fine sediment fraction (<63μm) of eight samples was performed by ICP-MS. Elemental composition of sediments is quite different in the two studied river valleys, which indicates different origin of their waters. Also, concentrations of selected metals were compared with existing sediment quality criteria and anthropogenic influence is evaluated and discussed. Analytical results of major ions determined in three springs (Kupa spring, Rječina spring, Zvir spring in the City of Rijeka) were used to construct a Piper diagram, which showed that they are of a Ca–Na–HCO3–Cl type. The highest concentration of Mg is present in the Kupa spring, while the highest concentrations of Na and Cl are present in the Zvir spring. Groundwaters are underlain by limestone, less by dolomite and are under a maritime influence. There is a big difference with the main groundwater types reported in North Africa, i.e. in the south Mediterranean Sea, where two main groundwater types are Na–Cl and Ca–SO4–Cl. Concentrations of total and dissolved fractions of trace metals in surface water samples were determined by voltammetry and compared to the European Water Framework Directive values. Concentrations of total Pb and Zn are significantly higher in the water of the Kupa spring than the Rječina spring, suggesting that the karst water bodies of the two springs are not of the same origin. In addition, stable isotope composition (deuterium and oxygen-18) was determined in the spring waters sampled during low and high water conditions. Due to the significant difference in oxygen isotope-ratios it was concluded that the karst reservoir for the Kupa and Rječina springs is not identical. The results obtained from the combination of physical–chemical, geochemical (water and sediment) and isotope multi-technique analyses pointed out that even though the springs of the Kupa and Rječina rivers originate from the same mountain range, they do not drain the same karst aquifer.","Risnjak National Park,Kupa and Rječina rivers (Croatia),Stable isotopes (deuterium and oxygen-18),Water quality,Transboundary karst aquifer,Perhumid climate,Sediment and water chemistry,Physical–chemical parameters,"
"the recent sedimentation history of the esk estuary, cumbria, u.k.: the application of radiochronology","1984","The sediments of the Esk estuary, Cumbria, contain a variety of radionuclides which are derived from the British Nuclear Fuels Ltd (BNFL) reprocessing plant at Sellafield, Cumbria. In principle the total ecosystem of the Esk estuary is labelled with a variety of radionuclides which we have studied in order to investigate fundamental process which take place in estuaries; also to improve our knowledge of relationships which exist between the rate of release of radionuclides in the BNFL source term and their distribution in the Esk. On the basis of defined sampling procedures we have dated the rate of sedimentation for the major sediment types of the system using six different radionuclides, and four independent methods, including a procedure of statistical modelling. The model is based upon procedures for matching the shape of the BNFL radionuclide release profile over a period of ∼ 10 y, with that for the distribution of radionuclides in profiles of sediment cores. Good agreement is obtained for the match. In the Esk a large proportion of the radionuclides which are retained in sediments are associated with particulate matter and surfaces of sediment debris; in accreting sediments these deposits have not been disturbed during the past ∼ 30 y. In modelling the releases of radionuclides from point sources, attention needs to be paid to the chemical and physical composition of the source term, as this can influence the subsequent distribution of radionuclides in nearshore and estuarine marine ecosystems.",""
"a novel bias-tsp algorithm for maritime patrol","2023","This work aims to develop a search planning strategy to be used by a drone equipped with an inverse synthetic-aperture radar (ISAR) and an electro-optical sensor. After describing the specifics of our maritime scenario, we discuss four methodologies that can be used to find vessels involved in illegal fishing activities as quickly as possible. In addition to the clustering of the vessels, determined by the droneâ€™s electro-optical sensor range, we introduce a novel technique to bias a traveling salesman problem (TSP) tour. This bias is based on deliberately increasing distances to vessels that are classified as probable fishing vessels. This increase in distance is meant to prioritize visits to probable fishing vessels. Vessels are classified based on their length. The classification result and the vessel clustering are available before the actual planning of the tour. Simulations of scenarios in which we have a few vessels fishing illegally show that the novel technique, the bias-TSP, combined with a tour orientation based on operational considerations, outperforms the classic TSP: the mean distance traveled to find all the vessels involved in illegal fishing activities is reduced by at least 35â€“50%.

"geochemistry of redox-sensitive trace elements in a shallow subterranean estuary","2015","Submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) is an important component of chemical fluxes in the coastal ocean. The composition of SGD is influenced by biogeochemical reactions that take place within the subterranean estuary (STE), the subsurface mixing zone of fresh and saline groundwaters. The STE is characterized by redox gradients that affect the speciation and mobility of redox-sensitive elements (RSEs). We examined the distributions and behavior of the RSEs Mo, U, V, and Cr within the larger redox framework of a shallow STE and evaluated the source-sink function of the STE for these elements. We found that the advection of water through the STE and the apparent respiration of organic matter drives the formation of a “classic” redox sequence typically observed in diffusion-dominated fine-grained sediments. High concentrations of dissolved organic matter (up to 2.9mM) lead to extensive sulfide production (up to 1.8mM) within 3m of the surface. Both Mo and U are quantitatively removed as oxic surface waters mix into ferruginous and sulfidic zones. Molybdenum removal appears to occur where sulfide concentrations exceed ~11μM, a previously reported threshold for quantitative formation of highly particle-reactive thiomolybdate species. Uranium removal apparently occurs via reduction and formation of insoluble phases or sorption to sediments. It is not clear how readily sequestered metals may be returned to solution, but SGD may be an important sink in the marine budget for both Mo and U. In contrast, both V and Cr show non-conservative addition across the salinity mixing gradient. Increases in pH appear to promote dissolution of V from minerals within the shallow aquifer, and mobilization may also be associated with dissolved organic matter. Chromium enrichment is associated with higher dissolved organic matter and is likely due to the formation of soluble Cr-organic complexes. Fluxes of these elements were constrained using SGD volume fluxes, determined using radium isotopes as well as direct discharge measurements by Lee-type seepage meters, and concentrations in directly-sampled seepage (Mo: −0.21 to −7.7μmolm−2day−1; U: −0.02 to −0.6μmolm−2day−1; V: 0.05 to 2.0μmolm−2day−1; Cr: 0.12 to 4.4μmolm−2day−1).","Chromium,Uranium,Molybdenum,Submarine groundwater discharge,Redox sensitive elements,Subterranean estuary,Geochemistry,Vanadium,Trace metals,"
"satellite machine-type communication for maritime internet of things: an interference perspective","2019","Satellite machine-type communication plays a crucial role in the maritime Internet of Things. The realization of such a system, i.e., the VHF data exchange (VDES) satellite system, however, faces many technical challenges. Due to its global broadcasting nature, the interference generated from the emissions of the VDES satellite space stations to the incumbent or future land systems in the same band is of major concern to the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) spectrum allocation. However, neither regulatory rules nor related studies have been specified or made available in the literature regarding such interference. This paper utilizes the electromagnetic power flux density (PFD) mask concept for evaluating and constraining the emission onto earth from a satellite space station. The mathematical analysis and derivation are based on the principle that the actual interference from a space station that a land system experiences is no worse than that from any other land system allowed by the regulations. We demonstrate the derivation of such a PFD mask from three closely related regulations on the legacy land mobile systems by the Electronic Communications Committee (ECC) and ITU and present the corresponding constraints imposed on the VDES satellite system and their impacts on the performance of the system.","VDES satellite space station system,interference perspective,satellite machine-type communication,maritime machine-type communication,VHF data exchange satellite system,Internet of Things,Marine vehicles,satellite communication,electromagnetic PFD mask concept,Space stations,ITU,Electronic Communications Committee,e-navigation,electronic data interchange,Maritime Internet of Things,Artificial intelligence,space communication links,maritime Internet of Things,radiofrequency interference,ITU spectrum allocation,electromagnetic power flux density mask concept,Satellite broadcasting,ECC,mathematical analysis,land system experiences,land mobile systems,Interference,International Telecommunication Union spectrum allocation,"
"sea-ice reconstructions from bromine and iodine in ice cores","2021","As the intricacies of paleoclimate dynamics are explored, it is becoming understood that sea-ice variability can instigate, or contribute to, climate change instabilities commonly described as “tipping points”. Compared to ice sheets and circulating ocean currents, sea-ice is ephemeral and continental-scale changes to sea ice cover occur seasonally. Sea-ice greatly influences polar albedo, atmosphere-ocean gas exchange and vertical mixing of polar ocean masses. Major changes in sea ice distribution and thickness have been invoked as drivers of deglaciations as well as stadial climate variability described in Greenland climate records as “Dansgaard-Oeschger” cycles and described in Antarctic climate records as “Antarctic Isotopic Maxima”. The role of halogens in polar atmospheric chemistry has been studied intensively over the past few decades. This research has been driven by the role of bromine, primarily as gas-phase bromine monoxide (BrO), which exerts a key control on polar tropospheric ozone concentrations. Initial findings led to the discovery of boundary-layer self-catalyzing heterogeneous bromine reactions fed by sunlight and ozone, known as bromine explosions. First-year sea-ice and blowing snow have been identified as key components for this heterogeneous bromine recycling in the polar boundary layer. This understanding of polar halogen chemistry – supported by an expanding body of observations and modeling – has formed the basis for investigating quantitative links between halogen concentrations in the polar atmospheric boundary layer and sea-ice presence and/or extent. Despite the clear importance of sea-ice in paleoclimate research, the ice core community lacks a conservative and quantitative proxy for sea-ice extent. The most commonly applied proxy, methanesulphonic acid (MSA), is volatile and has not been demonstrated reliably for ice core records extending beyond the last few centuries. Sodium has also been applied to reconstruct sea-ice extent in a semi-quantitative manner although the effects of meteorological transport noise are significant. Contrary to a priori expectations, the halogens bromine and iodine appear to be stable in polar snow and ice over millennial timescales, addressing the temporal limitations of MSA records. Unfortunately, transport and meteorological variability influence sodium deposition as well as the deposition of halogens and the many other ionic impurities found in ice cores. The atmospheric chemistry of halogens is more complex than those of sodium or MSA due to the mixed-phase (gas and aerosol) nature of halogen photochemistry. Thus the application of halogen records in ice cores to sea-ice reconstruction overcomes some challenges posed by existing proxies, but also opens new challenges specific to halogens. Challenges common to all sea-ice proxies include the deconvolution of changes in emission source locations and changes in transport efficacy, particularly those occurring during climate transitions combining changes in sea-ice and atmospheric circulation, such as stadial/interstadial or glacial/interglacial climate variability. In this review, we describe the rationale and available evidence for linking the halogens bromine and iodine found in polar snow and ice to sea-ice extent. Reported measurements of bromine and iodine in polar snow and ice samples are critically discussed. We also consider aspects of halogen transport and retention in polar snow and ice that are still poorly understood. Overall, there is a growing body of evidence supporting the application of bromine to sea-ice reconstructions, and the use of iodine to reconstruct marine biological activity mediated in part by sea-ice extent. These halogens complement existing sea-ice proxies but most crucially, offer the capacity to greatly extend the temporal and spatial coverage of ice core-based sea-ice reconstructions.

"a shipborne antenna for maritime satellite communications","1974","From a cost effectiveness point of view, the shipborne antenna is usually considered the most critical component in a shipborne terminal for maritime satellite communications (MARSAT). For possible use in such a system, a high gain autotrack antenna has been developed. The antenna utilizes a combined electronical and mechanical beam steering realized with two planar phased arrays mounted on a mechanical axis. The antenna system is designed for unmanned operation, utilizing an automatic search-and-track mode. After acquisition of a beacon signal from the satellite, a monopulse track mode keeps the antenna pointing position locked, to the direction of incident beacon signal, irrespective of the motions of the ship. Attention has been paid to multipath effects that may occur, in particular reflections from the surface of the sea. This paper is concerned with the design background and the development of the antenna system.","Planar arrays,Directive antennas,Phased arrays,Marine antennas,Costs,Antenna arrays,Satellite communications,Antenna accessories,Satellite communication,Marine vehicles,Beam steering,Tracking,Satellite antennas,"

"unsupervised learning based coordinated multi-task allocation for unmanned surface vehicles","2021","In recent decades, unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) are attracting increasing attention due to their underlying capability in autonomously undertaking complex maritime tasks in constrained environments. However, the autonomy level of USVs is still limited, especially when being deployed to conduct multiple tasks simultaneously. This paper, therefore, aims to improve USVs autonomy level by investigating and developing an effective and efficient task management algorithm for multi-USV systems. To better deal with challenging requirements such as allocating vast tasks in cluttered environments, the task management has been de-composed into two submissions, i.e., task allocation and task execution. More specifically, unsupervised learning strategies have been used with an improved K-means algorithm proposed to first assign different tasks for a multi-USV system then a self-organising map (SOM) been implemented to deal with the task execution problem based upon the assigned tasks for each USV. Differing to other work, the communication problem that is crucial for USVs in a constrained environment has been specifically resolved by designing a new competition strategy for K-means algorithm. Key factors that will influence the communication capability in practical applications have been taken into account. A holistic task management architecture has been designed by integrating both the task allocation and task execution algorithms, and a number of simulations in both simulated and practical maritime environments have been carried out to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.","Unsupervised learning,Multi-task allocation,Self-organising map (SOM),K-means clustering,Unmanned surface vehicle (USV),"
"intelligent anomaly detection of trajectories for iot empowered maritime transportation systems","2023","The convergence of Maritime Transportation Systems (MTS) and Internet of Things (IoT) has led to the promising IoT-empowered MTS (IoT-MTS). However, abnormal trajectories of maritime transportation ships can have highly negative impacts on the management of IoT-MTS. Therefore, anomaly detection of trajectories is important for the successful deployment of IoT-MTS. In this paper, we propose a Transfer Learning based Trajectory Anomaly Detection strategy, named TLTAD, for IoT-MTS. Specifically, a variational autoencoder is used to discover the potential connections between each dimension of the normal trajectory, while a graph variational autoencoder is used to explore the spatial similarity between normal trajectories. Based on internal connection of trajectories, a deep reinforcement learning algorithm, Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic policy gradient (TD3), is employed to train the trajectory anomaly detection model. To reduce the model training time, transfer learning is used to migrate the trained anomaly detection model between different regions of an ocean area or between similar ocean areas. Moreover, an efficient data transformation module is designed to improve the efficiency of model transfer. The experiments were conducted on a real-world automatic identification system (AIS) dataset. The results indicate that the proposed TLTAD can provide accurate anomaly detection on shipsâ€™ trajectories in IoT-MTS with reduced model training times.","reduced model training times,Transportation,deep learning (artificial intelligence),Anomaly detection,maritime transportation systems,anomaly detection,Internet of Things,transportation,Marine vehicles,abnormal trajectories,Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic policy gradient,highly negative impacts,model training time,ships,IoT-MTS,trajectory anomaly detection model,deep reinforcement learning algorithm,Data models,normal trajectory,reinforcement learning,maritime transportation ships,Artificial intelligence,real-world automatic identification system dataset,Maritime Transportation Systems,graph variational autoencoder,trained anomaly detection model,Trajectory Anomaly Detection strategy,gradient methods,Deep reinforcement learning,model transfer,Trajectory,promising IoT-empowered MTS,intelligent Anomaly Detection,transfer learning,learning (artificial intelligence),data handling,Analytical models,"
"an ins-aided mass autonomous navigation algorithm considering virtual motion constraints and the leeway and drift angle","2023","Autonomous navigation is one of the critical enabling technologies in developing MASS or intelligent ships. This study proposes an autonomous navigation algorithm with INS-aided shipborne GNSS. The proposed algorithm constructs the ship's virtual motion attitude by considering the leeway and drift angle, and takes into account the one-dimensional speed constraints in the virtual ship body reference frame. This approach addresses the issue that the conventional INS and shipborne GNSS integrated navigation scheme can utilize the three-dimensional position information only, without considering the measurement update from the one-dimensional speed obtained by shipborne GNSS. The algorithm is verified by actual ship departure and cruising experiments in natural marine environments. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has a higher accuracy than the conventional algorithm when the GNSS speed and position information are available. In the scenario when the GNSS position information is temporarily lost, the proposed algorithm can continue to derive relatively reliable navigation parameters for the safe navigation of ships with only one-dimensional speed measurement.","Leeway and drift angle,GNSS,INS,Autonomous navigation,Motion constraints,MASS,"

This paper describes an evaluation of the resource reservation service (RRS), a distributed admission control protocol designed to guarantee end-to-end bandwidth for critical traffic in the maritime environment. The evaluation was accomplished using the OPNET discrete-event simulation tool. The RRS includes a number of features tailored for maritime networks including multiroute probing, aggregated pre-emption, and improved robustness. The effect of this service on network traffic is compared with two alternate reservation protocols: RSVP, the standard for wired networks, and INSIGNIA, a MANET reservation protocol.","Traffic control,quality of service,Telecommunication traffic,Unicast,bandwidth allocation,multiroute probing,end-to-end bandwidth,Quality of service,network traffic,Multicast protocols,protocols,Bandwidth,telecommunication traffic,Admission control,distributed admission control protocol,marine communication,maritime tactical network,Mobile ad hoc networks,Tellurium,military communication,resource allocation,resource reservation service,Communication system traffic control,"
"characterization of a transmitter in a medium frequency maritime terrestrial navigation system","2019","Due to the worldwide recognition of increased jamming and spoofing events, which threaten the usability of global navigation satellite systems (GNSS), positioning systems using signals of opportunity are gaining importance as backup systems. Especially for maritime usage, a terrestrial system called Ranging-Mode (R-Mode) is under development. Among other signals, it utilizes the maritime medium frequency broadcasts of the differential GNSS (DGNSS) service. Currently, the estimation of phase in a time continuous medium frequency signal is used to determine the distance between transmitter and receiver. Here, the delay of a transmitter on the signal phase is of great interest, since it directly affects the performance of the R-Mode system. In this paper, the influence of a medium frequency power amplifier is characterized as part of the transmitter chain. The aim is to give the operators of DGNSS stations the possibility to characterize their station themselves when the R-Mode system is operational. Therefore, widely used measuring instruments are utilized, rather than using well-known cost-intensive techniques like phase delay measurements. A simple setup with different evaluation methods that fit this requirement is presented. Furthermore, it is capable of measuring the absolute time delay. The presented workflow was tested on an amplifier with output power of 100 W at the transmitter station near Koblenz, Germany.","R-Mode,terrestrial system,Delays,marine navigation,transmitter delay measurement,power amplifiers,phase delay measurements,Transmitters,DGNSS stations,jamming,global navigation satellite systems,synchronisation,Delay effects,satellite navigation,R-Mode system,transmitter chain,medium frequency power amplifier,power 100.0 W,time continuous medium frequency signal,medium frequency maritime terrestrial navigation system,signal phase,Ranging-Mode,backup systems,Time-frequency analysis,Oscilloscopes,spoofing events,differential GNSS service,maritime medium frequency broadcasts,transmitter station,radio transmitters,terrestrial navigation system,"

The performed literary analysis of scientific sources of information confirms the significant lack of research aimed at the development of waterway infrastructure for unmanned ships. The study described in this paper is aimed at developing a design criterion that determines the possibility of using the waterway for the operation of autonomous ships. Data on the movement and density of ships for the waters of the Gulf of Finland according to the data of Automatic Identification System are presented. The analysis of vessel density in this work was carried out using the DBSCAN mathematical algorithm. It is proposed to use the concept and term 'knowledgeable' to include sections of the waterway in the zone of autonomous navigation. The involved experts assessed five criteria in terms of their significance: the availability of data on navigation on the selected section of the waterway, the availability of electronic navigation charts, the availability of hydrometeorological information, the availability of technical means of communication and navigational fencing. As a continuation of the research, it is proposed to study many qualitative and quantitative characteristics of both the area of the water area and the specialized equipment installed on it, since the operation of autonomous ships requires a more complex technical and information infrastructure.","knowledge of the water area,vessel traffic monitoring,DBSCAN,Autonomous navigation,maritime waterways,ships position clustering,automatic identification system,water transport system,expert system,"
"improbability mapping: a metric for satellite-detection of submarine volcanic eruptions","2014","Submarine volcanic eruptions can result in both real and apparent changes in marine algal communities, e.g., increases in phytoplankton biomass and/or growth rates that can cover thousands of square kilometers. Satellite ocean color monitoring detects these changes as increases in chlorophyll and particulate backscattering. Detailed, high resolution analysis is needed to separate the optical effects of volcanic products from the response of the marine algal community. It is possible to calculate an index, which maps the magnitude of improbable change (relative to long term average conditions) following known volcanic eruptions by using low resolution, initial estimates of chlorophyll and backscatter along with an archived history of satellite data. We apply multivariate probability analysis to changes in global satellite ocean chlorophyll and particulate backscatter data to create a new metric for observing apparent biological responses to submarine eruptions. Several examples are shown, illustrating the sensitivity of our improbability mapping index to known submarine volcanic events, yielding a potentially robust method for the detection of new events in remote locations.","Improbability mapping index,Satellite detection,Submarine volcanic eruptions,"
"maritime moving target long time integration for gnss-based passive bistatic radar","2018","This paper addresses the exploitation of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) as transmitters of opportunity in passive bistatic radar systems for maritime surveillance. The main limitation of this technology is the restricted power budget provided by navigation satellites, which makes it necessary to define innovative moving target detection techniques specifically tailored for the system under consideration. To this aim, this paper puts forward long integration time techniques able to collect the signal energy over long time intervals (tens of seconds), allowing the retrieval of suitable levels of signal-to-disturbance ratios for detection purposes. A local plane based technique is first considered, providing target detection in a plane that represents the section of maritime area covered by the radar antenna. As a suboptimum solution in terms of achievable integration gain, but more efficient from a computational point of view, a second technique is considered working in the conventional bistatic range and Doppler plane (basic plane based).

"a task allocation scheme generation method for maritime oil spill emergency monitoring based on bilateral matching","2022","Aiming at the task allocation problem of maritime oil spill emergency monitoring, the bilateral matching theory is applied to standardize the task allocation process and improve the emergency effectiveness. First of all, the task of maritime oil spill emergency monitoring and the monitoring subjects carrying out the tasks are identified, and the specific types, difficulties and risks of the tasks are identified. Then, the task type is introduced to indirectly express the relationship between â€˜monitoring subject-taskâ€™. On this basis, two concepts of task demand satisfaction and emergency monitoring subject capability competency are proposed to express the preference information of bilateral subjects. And then on the basis of redefining the specific connotation of the basic concept of bilateral matching theory under the background of maritime oil spill emergency monitoring task allocation, a bilateral matching model for task allocation of maritime oil spill emergency monitoring considering attribute priority is constructed. Finally, according to the specific characteristics of the model, a fast generation algorithm of feasible solution is designed to solve the problem.

"interception of chemicals at a forest edge for a rural low-lying site at black wood, hampshire, southern england","1994","Precipitation (rainfall and snowfall), throughfall, stemflow and net-precipitation (throughfall and stemflow) chemistry data are presented for a block-network of collectors located in a beech plantation in a rural area of southern England. The precipitation shows a variable chemistry linked to the relative supplies of material derived from maritime, pollutant and lithogenic sources. Inputs of solutes are spatially variable for those components associated with pollutant sources indicating local and variable sources for these constituents. Gaseous concentrations of SOx, NOx and NH3 all average ∼ 8 ppb outside the forest: within the forest, lower concentrations were observed. The precipitation — throughfall — stemflow results indicate that the trees capture occult deposition (i.e. non-precipitation detected atmospheric supplies of materials, e.g. from fine-droplets/mist, gases and particulate matter), thereby enriching the composition of stemflow and throughfall. Concentrations and fluxes of most solutes are increased by between 50 and 100%: only strontium, barium and hydrogen ions show a depletion. At the forest edge, there is an even greater difference between the precipitation and net-precipitation, especially for the sea-salts: the trees at the forest edge are particularly efficient at scavenging the occult materials. There are differences in chemical fluxes for the blocks that are not simply confined to an edge-interior division: this is most marked for manganese where cycling through the vegetation is dominant and the various locations respond in different ways. Despite storm damage there is little sign of a change in the chemical fluxes to the catchment: the loss of canopy is probably compensated for by an increased roughness that, in turn, results in increased turbulence, higher interception loss and greater scavenging.","Rainfall,Throughfall,Forest,Beech,Chemical,Interception,Stemflow,"
"chemical composition and provenance of chinese porcelain shards recovered from old goa, west coast of india","2017","During recent archaeological explorations at Old Goa, west coast of India, twenty three Chinese porcelain shards of the Ming (Middle to late 16th century), Qing (17th century) and late Qing period (late 17th century) have been recovered. In order to understand the nature and source of raw material and kilns, these shards were analysed for major elements with X-ray fluorescence (XRF), trace and rare earth elements by Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS). The analysis suggests that porcelain shards are siliceous in nature (SiO2~70%) and contain high Al2O3 (21.6%), Rb (388ppm) and Ba (160ppm) but have low Sr (48ppm). This composition suggests that the raw materials used for producing porcelain were silica, kaolinite and sericite which are characteristics of porcelains manufactured in Southern China. Comparatively, high Al2O3 (kaolinite) content in porcelains of the Qing Dynasty suggest improvement of quality, particularly mechanical strength, of Jingdezhen porcelain. In general, major element composition, trace metals, total rare earth elements (∑REE-67ppm) and their chondrite - normalized pattern of the Ming, Qing and late Qing period are nearly similar and appear to be made of identical raw materials.","Old Goa,Jingdezhen kiln,Chinese porcelain,Ming and Qing period,South China,Maritime trade,ICP-MS and XRF analysis,"

"the response of metal mobilization and redistribution to reoxygenation in baltic sea anoxic sediments","2022","To bring life back to anoxic coastal and sea basins, reoxygenation of anoxic/hypoxic zones has been proposed. This research focuses on the metals released during the oxidization of sediments from two locations in the anoxic Eastern Gotland Basin under a laboratory-scale study. Triplicate experimental cores and reference cores were collected from the North and South Eastern Gotland Basins. The oxygenation of the water column took place over a 96-hour experiment in a dark and 5 °C environment. In 12 and 24 hour intervals, the surface waters were exchanged and, over time, analyzed for pH, electroconductivity (EC), total organic carbon (TOC), soluble metal concentrations, and the top samples (0–10 cm) were analyzed with 3-step (E1: water-soluble, E2: exchangeable, and E3: organic-bound) sequential chemical extraction (SCE). Results show stable pH and decreasing EC in the column waters. The EC indicates that metals are released in the initial phases (12 h) of reoxygenation for both sites. Arsenic, Ba, Co, Mn, Rb, U, K, Sr, and Mo are released into the water column during the 96 hour experiment, and based on the calculations for the entire East Gotland Basin, would mean 8, 50, 0.55, 734, 53, 27, 347,178, 3468, and 156 μg L−1 are released, respectively. Elements Mn, Mo, U, and As are released in higher concentrations during the experiment than previously measured in the Eastern Gotland Basin, which provides vital information for future proposed remediation and natural geochemical processes with their known environmental impacts. The SCE results show that redox-sensitive metals (Mn, U, and Mo) are released in the highest concentrations into the solution. The relationship between the highest released metals (beside redox-sensitive) into solution over the oxygenation and their initial abundant phase is noticed, where the smallest released concentrations belong to K < Rb < Sr in E2, and As<Ba in E3, respectively.","Remediation,Eutrophication,Anoxic,Metal contamination,Water contamination,Sequential chemical extraction,"

From various standpoints, it appears that maritime satellite systems are more desirable than conventional (nontelex) marine telegraph/telephone. In addition, the improved performance, capability, and potential of satellites could outweigh the slightly lower annual traffic and equipment cost for HF marine telex.","Telegraphy,Oceans,Telephony,Marine-vehicle navigation,Satellite navigation systems,Satellite broadcasting,Communication industry,multiaccess,Costs,Satellite communication,Radio navigation position measurement,Marine vehicles,Shipbuilding industry,Marine-vehicle communication,Government,"
"radar detection in maritime environment: dependence on the radar antenna height in duct situations","2015","Different meteorological conditions in maritime environment induce different optimal radar antenna heights to achieve a detection range as high as possible. Consequently the radar might be operated on an elevator moving along a mast. This offers the possibility to adjust the antenna height adaptively depending on the current atmospheric conditions. The possibility of utilizing an elevator moving along a mast and thus change the antenna position in height implies for the future for each site to require only one antenna instead of - so far - two antennas, one antenna about 40 - 60 m aloft and another so-called Duct-antenna at ground level to meet the Duct problem.","maritime environment,meteorological conditions,duct situations,marine radar,Radar antennas,Ducts,Meteorological radar,radar detection,radar antenna height,optimal radar antenna heights,antenna position,Standards,radar antennas,Radar detection,"
"anti-jitter beamforming design for uav-assisted maritime monitoring networks","2023","With the wide application of Internet of Things systems in the smart ocean, many unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) have been deployed jointly with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to monitor the maritime environment. However, conventional means of maritime communication prevent the UAV and the USV from providing high-rate services owing to complex maritime channel conditions and limited bandwidth, which will affect the maritime environment monitoring performance. In this paper, we propose a USV-UAV collaborative patrol scheme for maritime environment monitoring networks. Considering the characteristic of energy concentration in beamforming and the beam deviation caused by UAV jitter due to the harsh ocean condition, we studied an adaptive anti-jitter beamforming problem in UAV-assisted maritime environment monitoring networks. Specifically, we decompose the adaptive anti-jitter beamforming problem into two subproblems. In the first sub-problem, the location deployment of UAV and beam gain allocation is optimized via an iterative search algorithm based on ideal beamforming. In the second sub-problem, anti-jitter beamforming design is solved by an adaptive particle swarm optimization algorithm based on social learning, which effectively improves the average spectral efficiency of the system. Finally, the simulation results show that the proposed algorithm has good adaptability under different jitter amplitudes and effectively improves the spectral efficiency without increasing the complexity.","unmanned aerial vehicles,array signal processing,high-rate services,maritime environment monitoring performance,remotely operated vehicles,Internet of Things,USV-UAV collaborative patrol scheme,UAV jitter,ideal beamforming,anti-jitter beamforming,particle swarm optimisation,Array signal processing,maritime environment monitoring,adaptive particle swarm optimization algorithm,different jitter amplitudes,complex maritime channel conditions,Oceans,harsh ocean condition,Autonomous aerial vehicles,maritime communication,iterative methods,autonomous aerial vehicles,adaptive anti-jitter beamforming problem,UAV-assisted maritime monitoring networks,search problems,UAV-assisted maritime environment monitoring networks,unmanned surface vehicles,Jitter,marine communication,Adaptive systems,Simulation,smart ocean,Spectral efficiency,anti-jitter beamforming design,USV,UAV,"
"detecting co2 leakage at offshore storage sites using the covariance between the partial pressure of co2 and the saturation of dissolved oxygen in seawater","2018","An option to detect CO2 leakage from deep geological storage under the seabed is monitoring the partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) in the sea. One of the challenges of this technique is to differentiate pCO2 elevations caused by CO2 leakage from variations in the natural baseline (which varies due to seasonal and other factors). This paper compares a covariance threshold for anomalous pCO2 (a threshold based on pCO2 and dissolved oxygen), with annual and seasonal constant thresholds, using data observed in two hydrologically contrasting areas in Osaka Bay, Japan. In one of these locations the water column is typically stratified throughout the year, whereas at the other it is vertically mixed. The covariance threshold often but not consistently outperforms the constant thresholds, but is effective in all the cases analyzed in the present study. In any season in the mixed area, and in winter in the stratified area, the possibility of false-negatives in the seasonal threshold method is smaller than or comparable with that in the covariance threshold one. In areas with large natural pCO2 variations, such as during summer in the stratified area, the covariance threshold method is efficient in detecting CO2 leakage whereas the seasonal threshold method is of little use. With a good understanding of local conditions, monitoring pCO2 with the covariance threshold method is a potentially useful but not sufficient option for leakage detection in the marine environment.","Dissolved oxygen,CO leakage,Coastal ocean,Monitoring,Detection,Partial pressure of CO,"
"application of iot to monitor the shipping of goods in maritime transportation system","2022","Surprising occurrences like temperature variations, humidity shifts, and vibrations might devalue the products being carried. ICT must be used to stop unwelcome occurrences from happening and fix some problems with the delivery of products.

"gis-enabled maritime awareness system (gmas)","2009","Being aware of maritime activities is important for homeland security. We have worked with the US Coast Guard to develop a waterway visual surveillance system on Elba Island, in Savannah, GA for maritime awareness. With the system, we developed an enhanced temporal difference algorithm based on active zone (ETD-AZ) to detect waterway moving objects, including container ships, commercial vessels, small vessels, sailboats, tugboats, and dolphins, etc. In the algorithm, active zone is first defined to model the imaging locations of moving objects that appear in the waterway; the model reduces noises caused by winds, clouds, and waves in the near-view fields. A thresholded difference map is computed by using temporal difference and thresholding methods. The thresholded difference map is further processed by applying morphological operations to remove noises. A final decision rule is derived to decide whether an image contains moving objects or not based on motion pixels in thresholded difference map and in the difference map after morphological operation. The proposed ETD-AZ algorithm has been tested using 21, 844 night and day images taken from Aug. 1-2, 2008, in different weather conditions: sunny, cloudy, windy, stormy with lightening, etc. The algorithm detected 89 of 94 waterway moving objects with 5.3% false negative rate while maintaining a low false positive rate of 4.0% for a total of 21, 478 non-object images.

"leveraging graph and deep learning uncertainties to detect anomalous maritime trajectories","2022","Understanding and representing traffic patterns are key to detecting anomalous trajectories in the transportation domain. However, some trajectories can exhibit heterogeneous maneuvering characteristics despite confining to normal patterns. Thus, we propose a novel graph-based trajectory representation and association scheme for extraction and confederation of traffic movement patterns, such that data patterns and uncertainty can be learned by deep learning (DL) models. This paper proposes the usage of a recurrent neural network (RNN)-based evidential regression model, which can predict trajectory at future timesteps as well as estimate the data and model uncertainties associated, to detect anomalous maritime trajectories, such as unusual vessel maneuvering, using automatic identification system (AIS) data. Furthermore, we utilize evidential deep learning classifiers to detect unusual turns of vessels and the loss of transmitted signal using predicted class probabilities with associated uncertainties. Our experimental results suggest that the graphical representation of traffic patterns improves the ability of the DL models, such as evidential and Monte Carlo dropout, to learn the temporal-spatial correlation of data and associated uncertainties. Using different datasets and experiments, we demonstrate that the estimated prediction uncertainty yields fundamental information for the detection of traffic anomalies in the maritime and, possibly in other domains.","Monte Carlo methods,classification,recurrent neural nets,graph,deep learning (artificial intelligence),Anomaly detection,DL models,graph-based trajectory representation,automatic identification system data,Monte Carlo dropout,graphical representation,traffic movement patterns,detect anomalous maritime trajectories,Predictive models,regression analysis,evidential deep learning,marine engineering,Data models,data patterns,pattern classification,Artificial intelligence,graph theory,RNN,regression,clustering,uncertainty,Trajectory,Uncertainty,probability,Computational modeling,traffic engineering computing,recurrent neural network-based evidential regression model,deep learning uncertainties,AIS data,"

"algorithm design of maritime wireless communication resources based on interference alignment","2022","With the increasing tension of wireless spectrum, interference has become a bottleneck problem in future wireless communication, and the urgency of interference management is particularly prominent. Traditional interference management methods have the defects of low spectral efficiency or limited interference. As a technology that can effectively improve network freedom and spectral efficiency, interference alignment can obtain greater gain compared with traditional methods, and has great potential in theory. As an effective means of interference management, interference alignment technology has been widely studied, and the difficulty of interference alignment is how to design the precoding matrix at the transmitting end and the decoding matrix at the receiving end, so as to meet the needs of system freedom. In the field of modern maritime communication, there are more and more application fields based on wireless technology, such as maritime detection, target detection and scheduling, which need to use wireless resources for data transmission, while maritime wireless resources are very tight.

This paper considers the identification of the Systematic Collision Risk (SCR) for an MITS based on AIS data, which is obtained by wireless communication among vessels and between vessels and shore-based stations. SCR is modeled as a function of the collision risk of each vessel. A computing method for the SCR of a two-vessel case is proposed. Meanwhile, a hierarchical clustering based simplification algorithm is provided and applied to transform the topology of an MITS, thus simplifying the computing of the SCR. Based on the two-vessel case and transformation, a bottom-to-top weighted fusion method is employed to calculate the SCR for an MITS.

"the lama system: a “smart” magnetometer network for harbour protection","2022","This work describes the development of an underwater anti-intrusion system based on a magnetometer self-informed network, whose purpose is to detect the presence of threats in the proximity of critical infrastructures (e.g, terrorist divers in harbours). In this context, the magnetic network fills the gaps of sonar systems at the critical boundaries of the water volume to be controlled (sea bed, docks, …), where acoustic performances deteriorate due to reflections and attenuations. The system operates in a port-protection scenario, characterized by a medium-high environmental magnetic noise that can hide the diver signal (a diver is a weak, quasi-point-like, moving source). The magnetometer network processes two inputs: the environmental magnetic noise and a signal including the target magnetic signal superimposed to the same noise; the frequencies of a diver signal lie within the noise band, hence frequency filtering proves inadequate for noise removal. The basic idea underlying the system is to measure and use the noise itself to filter the overall signal; measuring noise supports a background-subtraction process that allows to extract the target signal and therefore detect the threat presence. The effectiveness of the procedure depends on the positions of magnetometers: sensors must be close enough to one another to measure the common background noise, and, at the same time, should be distant enough from one another so that just one sensor can measure the target signal. To generate alarms when a threat is detected, a real-time software application processes data and activates a visual and acoustic alarm upon identification of a magnetic anomaly. Sea trials carried out in port areas provided extremely satisfactory results in the detection of intruders. The paper presents experimental results obtained during the method validation tests, when intruders were moving in the surrounding undersea environment.","Environmental magnetism,Marine geophysics,Time series analysis,Magnetic anomaly detection,Underwater magnetic systems,Harbour protection,"
"comparative analysis of positioning capability of beidou and gps in maritime islands","2022","After the full deployment of the Beidou-3 global satellite navigation system constellation, the positioning service range has been expanded from the Asia-Pacific region to the whole world. At present, most of the research on the positioning capability of Beidou system is on the mainland, and there is still room for research on the positioning capability of islands at sea. In this paper, the data of four IGS tracking stations distributed in islands are selected and solved by Anubis software. The visualization of Beidou and GPS is analyzed in five aspects: satellite visible number, standard single point positioning error, DOP value, signal-to-noise ratio, and multi-path effect. The results show that: (1) In the Asia-Pacific region, the positioning accuracy of Beidou's maritime islands is better than 0.734 m, 0.724 m, and 2.115 m in the N, E, and U directions, respectively, which is basically equivalent to GPS. Whereas, it is roughly 3 m, 3 m and 6 m lower than GPS outside the Asia-Pacific region, and the average number of visible satellites of Beidou in ANMG station and SOLO station is 15 and 11 respectively, which presumably means that the satellite density of Beidou system in the Asia-Pacific region is higher. (2) The average values of signal-to-noise ratio and multipath error of C22, C23, C24 and C25 stars of BeiDou are 41.638 dBHz and 0.574 m, respectively, which are basically comparable to those of G01, G02, G03 and G04 stars of GPS.

"an optimized approach of dynamic target nodes in wireless sensor network using bio inspired algorithms for maritime rescue","2023","Maritime search and rescue plays an important part in ensuring the safety of life at sea. When using wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technologies in maritime, nevertheless, it endures from situations where the measurement information is inadequate. In computing and networking for maritime applications, Wireless Sensor Network (WSNs) is a rising inflexion because of its amazing features. Simultaneously, there are some challenges faced by WSNs and node localization is one of them. Node localization is an important factor because until the location of reporting node is unknown, the data sensed by that node is totally useless. The main aim of this paper is towards gaining more improvement in localization by using swarm intelligence algorithm. To achieve this aim, a range-free and distributed method by using the application of salp swarm algorithm for moving target node in network for maritime rescue is proposed. The results are compared with existing algorithm Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Butterfly Optimization Algorithm (BOA).

"maritime containers tracking trial results","2009","There are approximately 7 million maritime-style containers within Canada, and 70 million within the US. The interiors of such containers are rarely inspected. With market globalization, a large amount of these containers enter North America on a daily basis. Such containers may include contraband or dangerous items that present an economic or security risk. Despite significant security improvements, only 3 to 5 % of the maritime containers, that arrive in, or transition through, North America, go through physical inspection. Current container tracking technologies based on GPS consume high DC power, are costly, require line-of-sight with satellites, and are often too large to be covert. It is possible to overcome some of these limitations by basing the tracking system on the FM broadcast signal which is an alternative man-made signal that is reasonably ubiquitous, provides a geographically-unique frequency spectrum and is about 100,000 times as strong as a GPS satellite signal. This allows the development of a low-cost, low-power and miniature FM receiver that can record frequency spectrums and compare them to known data in order to trace the path that the container has taken for less than $10 per container. This presents the first results of highway trials (train and sea trials are currently being conducted) of such a low-cost, covert, non-GPS based technology (called 'FM Tag') that records the worldwide displacement of containers and displays the path undertaken by the container while in transit. As an added security benefit, the tag is also capable of detecting container door openings. In addition to presenting the first trial results, this covers the innovative engineering aspects of using the metal enclosure of a maritime container as a VBF antenna, thereby eliminating the need to add an external antenna and achieving the goal of being 100% covert.","maritime containers tracking,US,Inspection,Canada,VHF antennas,Global Positioning System,FM broadcast signal,metal enclosure,Containers,Globalization,frequency spectrum,containers,market globalization,GPS,Satellite broadcasting,North America,Frequency,Road transportation,container tracking technologies,VHP antenna,Power generation economics,Security,"
"intelligent marine area supervision based on ais and radar fusion","2023","A weighted track fusion algorithm is proposed to address the complexity of conventional sea monitoring data and the lack of effective and convenient monitoring methods. The new algorithm uses local information entropy and fuses data from the automatic identification system (AIS) and X-band radar. The new model employs ship monitoring data to detect five types of abnormal ship behavior: speed, course, position, ship spacing, and time abnormalities. The method weights various factors using a weight matrix built up from a distance difference matrix between different track points and calculations of the distance information entropy and residual degree using information entropy theory. We tested the proposed weighted track fusion algorithm the fusion accuracy using actual data for 2813 ships, AIS, and radar track points based on local information entropy. The resulting correlation accuracy was 95.54% for 2716 ship track points and a correlation accuracy of 90.72% for 97 ship tracks. The results indicate that the proposed algorithm is suitable for fusing multiple tracks and is more robust than traditional fusion methods.","Intelligent supervision,Abnormal behavior,Radar,AIS,"
"wireless channel models for maritime communications","2018","Recently, broadband maritime communication has attracted much attention due to the rapid development of blue economy. In addition to the conventional MF/HF/VHF bands, there has been increasing interests in the utilization of higher frequency bands to provide broadband data service to the sea area. To design efficient maritime communication systems, the first and a fundamental requirement is to develop a framework to understand the wireless channels. In an integrated air-ground-sea communications network, there are two major type of channels to be investigated, namely the air-to-sea channel (e.g., for communication links from the aircraft-based base stations or relays) and the near-sea-surface channel (for land-to-ship/ship-to-land or ship-to-ship communications). Due to the unique features of the maritime propagation environment such as sparse scattering, sea wave movement, and the ducting effect over the sea surface, the modeling of these maritime channel links differs from conventional terrestrial wireless channels in many aspects and, consequently, will result in significant impact on the transceiver design. In this survey, we highlight the most notable differences from the modeling perspective as well as the channel characteristics for the air-to-sea and near-sea-surface channel links, with more focus on the latter. After a thorough review of existing modeling approaches and measurement campaigns, we conclude that the sparse and the location-dependent properties constitute the most important and distinctive characteristics of the maritime wireless channels. As such, we further remark on the challenges and research topics for future development of maritime communications.","evaporation duct,beyond line-of-sight,Wireless communication,Sea measurements,channel model,Channel models,Fading channels,Atmospheric modeling,Scattering,finite scattering,Maritime communications,"
"security in iot-enabled digital twins of maritime transportation systems","2023","The purposes are to explore the safety performance of the Maritime Transportation System (MTS) based on Digital Twins (DTs) Internet of Things (IoT) and develop maritime transportation towards intelligence and digitalization. Because the comprehensive operational security of modern MTS is not yet mature, historical transportation data of the Maritime Silk Road are acquired and preprocessed. Afterward, DTs are introduced, and relay nodes are added to data transmission paths to construct a maritime transportation DTs model based on relay cooperation IoT. Eventually, this modelâ€™s security performance is validated through simulation experiments. Relay security analysis suggests that interference information is a vital guarantee to assist in information non-disclosure, from which the constructed model can harvest energy to increase the data transmission power, thereby improving communication performance and secrecy rate. Outage probability analysis reveals that the simulated and the theoretical results are almost the same; moreover, given the systemâ€™s multi-hop paths in the same environment, the more the relays and the greater the fading index, the better the system performance and the lower the outage probability. Once the iterations reach a particular number, the node secrecy rate becomes optimal and cannot cause excessive burden to the system; besides, the power distribution can establish a new equilibrium when the nodes are in different locations, so that system security performance gets improved. The simulated value is closest to the actual result under 100% successful transmission probability and  $0.01\sim 0.05~\lambda $  value.

The proposed method is based on the representation of a ship's velocity with an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process and on the detection of changes of its long-run mean to identify navigational way-points. In order to assess the graph representativeness of the traffic, two performance metrics are introduced, leading to distinct graph construction criteria. Finally, the proposed method is validated against real-world Automatic Identification System data collected in a large area.","real-world data,Clustering algorithms,Anomaly detection,unsupervised learning,graph construction criteria,Marine vehicles,mean-reverting stochastic processes,unsupervised maritime traffic graph learning,Stochastic processes,maritime situational awareness,DBSCAN,Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process,change detection,ships,automatic identification system,stochastic processes,motion control,AIS,navigational legs,maritime traffic graph,Artificial intelligence,velocity control,graph theory,constant cruise velocity,Legged locomotion,clustering,graph representativeness,Navigation,navigation,graph learning,navigational way-points,ship velocity,"
"a novel concept for a satellite-based maritime search and rescue system","1977","Search and rescue (SAR) for both airborne and maritime vehicles has been an area of intense investigation for many years. Current techniques include employment of small distress transmitters which provide signals that have only a limited interception capability. This can considerably increase the search time and reduce its effectiveness. With the increased availability-existing and planned-of both synchronous and nonsynchronous satellites, SAR investigations are being directed toward the application of satellites. The present paper introduces the concept of satellite-based maritime search and rescue system (SAMSARS). This is a proposed pseudonoise (PN) wide-band spread spectrum system that would operate at low power levels and coexist with operational communication satellite systems (voice or data) without mutual interference. The use of existing operational satellite spectrum, instead of a dedicated distress channel or special satellites, is a major feature of SAMSARS. Other important aspects are its capability of providing unique identification and distress information in minutes following activation of the distress transmitter and its inherent immunity to false alarms. SAMSARS can also provide position location directly when three satellites are mutually visible or indirectly, by taking advantage of a vessel's on-board derived navigation data. This paper presents concept elements such as message structure, transmitter and receiver block diagrams, and unique features of SAMSARS. The paper also presents an operational example, including sample link power budgets, and finally specifies areas for further investigation.","Frequency,Wideband,Radio transmitters,Radio position measurement,multiaccess,Costs,Interference,Spread spectrum communication,Satellite communication,Artificial satellites,Vehicles,Spread-spectrum communications,Satellite broadcasting,Pseudonoise-coded communication,Employment,Marine-vehicle communication,"
"single image defogging based on illumination decomposition for visual maritime surveillance","2019","Single image fog removal is important for surveillance applications, and, recently, many defogging methods have been proposed. Due to the adverse atmospheric conditions, the scattering properties of foggy images depend on not only the depth information of scene but also the atmospheric aerosol model, which has a more prominent influence on illumination in a fog scene than that in a haze scene. However, the recent defogging methods confuse haze and fog, and they fail to consider fully the scattering properties. Thus, these methods are not sufficient to remove fog effects, especially for images in maritime surveillance. Therefore, this paper proposes a single image defogging method for visual maritime surveillance. First, a comprehensive scattering model is proposed to formulate a fog image in the glow-shaped environmental illumination. Then, an illumination decomposition algorithm is proposed to eliminate the glow effect on the airlight radiance and recover a fog layer, in which the objects at the infinite distance have uniform luminance. Second, a transmission-map estimation based on the non-local haze-lines prior is utilized to constrain the transmission map into a reasonable range for the input fog image. Finally, the proposed illumination compensation algorithm enables the defogging image to preserve the natural illumination information of the input image. In addition, a fog image dataset is established for the visual maritime surveillance. The experimental results based on the established dataset demonstrate that the proposed method can outperform the state-of-the-art methods in terms of both the subjective and objective evaluation criteria. Moreover, the proposed method can effectively remove fog and maintain naturalness for fog images.","state-of-the-art methods,glow-shaped environmental illumination,illumination decomposition,Lighting,adverse atmospheric conditions,scattering properties,fog scene,fog image dataset,Image defogging,fog effects,image enhancement,single image fog removal,foggy images,haze-lines prior,image colour analysis,Meteorology,fog,illumination decomposition algorithm,natural illumination information,Atmospheric modeling,Scattering,illumination compensation algorithm,marine engineering,surveillance applications,brightness,Oceans,visual maritime surveillance,atmospheric aerosol model,defogging image,lighting,nonlocal haze-lines,haze scene,comprehensive scattering model,input fog image,fog layer,image restoration,Visualization,image sensors,Surveillance,aerosols,single image defogging method,"
"biologically inspired cooperative spectrum sensing scheme for maritime cognitive radio networks","2018","Spectrum sensing is imperative to the success of maritime cognitive radio networks (MCRNs). Spectrum sensing in MCRNs is challenging because of the sea surface movement, the channel interference, and the unstable link quality. Recent research reveals that existing spectrum sensing schemes work well for lower sea states; however, they have failed to perform effectively at higher sea states. There are two disadvantages of performing spectrum sensing at higher sea states: 1) low probability of detection may also cause interference with primary system and 2) energy wastage. In this paper, a biologically inspired cooperative spectrum sensing scheme (BIC3S) is proposed to deal with the reliability and energy consumption challenges associated with the sea environment. It is based on the task allocation model of an insect colony. The proposed BIC3S chooses participating secondary users for cooperative spectrum sensing according to their given sea state. Further, it enables the secondary users to decide whether or not to perform spectrum sensing based on their sea state. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed scheme in terms of energy consumption, detection performance, and throughput. It is shown that the proposed BIC3S consumes less energy and, at the same time, achieves higher detection probability and fewer probability of false alarms compared to the existing schemes. Moreover, BIC3S provides better adaptation capabilities for the sea environment.","telecommunication network reliability,cooperative detection,cognitive radio,BIC3S,Cognitive radio network,maritime cognitive radio networks,Marine vehicles,channel interference,energy wastage,radio spectrum management,Wireless communication,task allocation model,higher sea states,unstable link quality,detection probability,low probability-of-detection,sea surface movement,sea environment,biologically inspired cooperative spectrum sensing scheme,Entropy,Sea state,radio networks,maritime communication,detection performance,Biology,insect colony,cooperative communication,signal detection,probability,energy consumption,marine communication,MCRN,spectrum sensing,Detectors,"

In a maritime environment, camera sensors are deployed on mobile platforms, such as buoys. With an anchored buoy architecture, sensor locations are quasi-stationary. When sensors move, some areas may not be covered at some times. This paper analyzes the extend of the uncovered area in a realistic maritime environment. We present numerical results to variation in uncovered areas from time to time.

"ree distribution and nd isotope composition of estuarine waters and bulk sediment leachates tracing lithogenic inputs in eastern canada","2019","The rare earth element (REE) concentrations and the neodymium (Nd) and strontium (Sr) isotope compositions of the detrital fraction and authigenic FeMn oxyhydroxide coatings of marine sediments may provide valuable information for better understanding the pathways of weathering inputs and estuarine and coastal exchange processes on different time scales. Here, we present the REE concentrations and 143Nd/144Nd (expressed in epsilon units, εNd) and 87Sr/86Sr ratios of detrital and authigenic (leached FeMn oxyhydroxides) fractions from sediment core-top samples and of estuarine water samples collected in the Estuary and Gulf of St. Lawrence (EGSL) and continental shelf off southeastern Canada. The REE distribution patterns, εNd values, and 87Sr/86Sr isotopic values from the detrital fraction allow for the discrimination of sediment from continental sources in the EGSL. Sediments in the Baie des Chaleurs and on the continental shelf, which have εNd values ranging from −14.3 to −16, 87Sr/86Sr values ranging from 0.72708 to 0.71475, and low La/Yb and Gd/Yb ratios, are mainly supplied by the early Paleozoic Appalachian Mountains. In contrast, sediments in the Laurentian and Esquiman channels (εNd = −18.7 to −21.8, 87Sr/86Sr = 0.72068 to 0.72607, and high La/Yb and Gd/Yb ratios) come from the Grenvillian metamorphic rocks in the Canadian Shield, and surface sediments on the southern Labrador Shelf (εNd = −28.7, 87Sr/86Sr = 0.73062, and high La/Yb and Gd/Yb ratios) mainly originate from the Hudson Strait and Baffin Bay. The εNd values obtained from estuarine water samples and bulk sediment leachates are unradiogenic, with values ranging between −18.9 and − 21.7 and between −16.1 and − 27.2, respectively. Based on these results and the dissolved REE concentrations, we speculate that salt-induced coagulation of colloidal matter, dissolution of lithogenic sediments from the adjacent continents (notably from the erosion of the Grenville Province on the North Shore), bottom scavenging within the nepheloid layer, and brine rejection during sea ice formation significantly influence the distribution of REEs and the authigenic εNd signal throughout the water column in the EGSL. Overall, our results both underscore the fact that caution must be exercised when interpreting authigenic εNd records due to bottom water-mass mixing in estuarine and coastal marine environments and highlight the potential of REE and NdSr isotope compositions in investigating changes in sediment sources and transport pathways in the EGSL.","Neodymium isotopes,Estuarine processes,Strontium isotopes,Sediment provenance,Estuary and gulf of St. Lawrence,Rare earth element,Particle scavenging,"
"assessment of offshore oil/gas platform status in the northern gulf of mexico using multi-source satellite time-series images","2018","Accurate knowledge of the detailed status (location and lifetime) of each oil/gas platform is crucial for ocean management and for understanding its potential environmental impact. However, this requirement is often compromised due to incomplete data records, especially when platform abandonment is not properly planned, designed, and/or executed. The availability of multi-source optical and SAR images provides the possibility of a systematic assessment, but the ubiquitous false positives and frequent geocoding errors make it technically challenging. Here, we develop a time-series remote sensing approach (TSRS) for detecting offshore platforms and determining their status, where the technical challenges are overcome using two strategies, as follows: (i) A stepwise optimization strategy applied to individual images and time-series images to mitigate numerous noises, to select platforms from candidates, and to assess platform status; and (ii) A cross geo-correction strategy using platforms derived from high-geometric accuracy images as ground control points to rectify poorly geo-referenced images. We applied the TSRS approach to the northern Gulf of Mexico using about 26,000 moderate-resolution optical/SAR images from eight satellites spanning the period from 1982 to 2017. TSRS detected a total of 9260 (5556) platforms in both Federal and State waters, including 3140 (1803) existing platforms, 5044 (3426) removed platforms, and 1076 (327) status-to-be-determined platforms where the numbers in parentheses represent those from Federal waters. Of these TSRS platforms, 4751 coincide spatially with 5476 (77.68%) of platform records of the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) platform database; 2846 (387 in Federal waters) are not found in the BSEE platform database but are convincingly supported by data from other sources (including BSEE-pipeline-database, time-series VIIRS nighttime light products, and littoral ground-truth images), meaning that 82.04% of the TSRS-derived platforms can be directly/indirectly confirmed. A site-specific validation in East Bay using multi-temporal ground-truth aerial images indicates that, for this site, the false negative rate (FNR) is ~9.63% and the false positive rate (FPR) is only 4.44%. The detailed beginning/end dates of the TSRS platforms are mostly confirmed by the corresponding Installation/Site-clear dates recorded in the BSEE platform database. Our findings suggest that the TSRS approach is a robust and cost-effective way to assess oil/gas platform status in large regions, and our results here may complement the official database, narrow down locations for future field investigations, and provide critical information for future assessment of the potential impacts of active and decommissioned platforms on the marine environments.","Landsat,Northern Gulf of Mexico,Offshore platform,Platform status assessment,Remote sensing,SAR,Time-series,"

"risk models for maritime security, area and port force protection","2010","Asymmetric and terrorist threats stand as perhaps one of the greatest threats to maritime forces at present. Accordingly, there has been an increase in the study of problems related to this threat in the defense community. This report discusses models related to maritime security, area and port force protection. The primary focus is the discussion of an area force protection model designed to consider the situation where an escorted vessel traveling through constrained waters comes under attack by a fast, small boat. A method where discrete bursts of gunfire are averaged over time to provide an effectiveness model is presented and used to identify the likelihood of defending against such an attacker. The approach is also used to identify the effects of ship maneuvers and augmentation teams in improving the probability of a positive outcome. Three other models that examine port scenarios are presented. The first is based on the same methodologies as the area force protection model and gives a measure of the ability to neutralize an incoming threat by a shore-based or moored defender. For the others, one uses an agent-based approach to identify how the positioning of a patrol boat guarding a particular asset affects its response capabilities, while the other introduces a ship-turning model to help define the areas in a port that could be struck by a hijacked commercial vessel. For all models, an example of the type of output that can be produced is presented.","Monte Carlo methods,patrol boat guarding positioning,shore-baseddefender,augmentation teams,agent-based approach,ship-turning model,maritime security,defence industry,marine safety,area force protection model,moored defender,hijacked commercial vessel,Force,port force protection,ship maneuver effect identification,sea ports,risk models,Boats,Weapons,Security,Radiation detectors,"
"butyltins concentration levels and imposex occurrence in snails from the sicilian coasts (italy)","2003","Two sampling campaigns have been carried out along the Sicilian coasts within the frame of a European project (Hic-TBT) financed by the LIFE programme. Snails and sediments have been sampled at 5 stations, characterised by very low (Ustica natural sea reserve), low (Ustica harbour), intermediate (Castellamare and Termini Imerese) and high shipping densities (Palermo). Biological and chemical analyses were carried out in order to evaluate the incidence of imposex occurring in snails, and the concentration levels of organotins in sediment and snail samples. Despite the low organotin concentration levels in sediment and snail samples, the results show that imposex is widespread around Sicily. In four locations almost all female snails were affected by imposex at advanced development stages, even in areas with a fairly low shipping density. Only in the natural sea reserve of Ustica Island imposex was relatively less severe. Finally a logarithmic correlation between TBT and imposex stages was observed.","Mediterranean Sea,Sediments,Antifouling paints,Gastropods,Tributyltin,"
"marine vehicle tracking using agile maritime iots","2021","Marine surveillance deals with the complex problem of modeling and estimating natural and human processes while operating with limited information acquisition resources. The complexity of the problem and the scarcity of resources, such as power, processing, and communications, requires agile distributed sensing and computing that provides scalability, diversity in information acquisition, and adaptive allocation of limited resources. This work deals with tracking multiple marine vehicles using data from heterogeneous sensors. Accurate tracking is achieved by a synergy between a network of agile maritime IoTs, with limited processing resources, and a fusion center, with computationally intensive capability. The IoTs can reconfigure their elementary processing operations settings to produce informative yet low volume measurement statistics. The fusion center handles heterogeneous data fusion and solves the complex problem of vehicle state estimation. We demonstrate that by configuring its agile distributed computing capabilities, the proposed system provides significant savings in processing and communications resources without deteriorating tracking performance.","Edge Computing,agile maritime IoTs,Neural Networks,sensor fusion,fusion center,Sequential Monte Carlo,human processes,Internet of Things,heterogeneous data fusion,agile distributed sensing,low volume measurement statistics,marine vehicle tracking,heterogeneous sensors,computationally intensive capability,agile distributed computing capabilities,vehicle state estimation,Robot sensing systems,adaptive allocation,complex problem,wireless sensor networks,Target tracking,state estimation,Volume measurement,Radar tracking,Scalability,information acquisition resources,communications resources,marine surveillance deals,Machine Learning,multiple marine vehicles,Sensors,tracking performance,Surveillance,elementary processing operations settings,marine vehicles,resource allocation,"
"spring and summer extreme temperatures in iberia during last century in relation to circulation types","2013","In the Iberian Peninsula the raise of temperatures has been notable from mid-1970s to mid-2000s, especially in spring and summer. This study analyses spatial and temporal relationships between extreme temperatures and atmospheric circulation types (CTs) defined over the Iberian Peninsula (IP) in these seasons. Station series (29) of maximum and minimum temperature are considered, starting from 1905 until 2006. The CTs (9 for spring and 8 for summer) are derived by a cluster method applied to daily mean SLP grids covering the period 1850–2003. Changes in the seasonal frequency of extreme temperatures and of CTs are analysed. Subsequently, the CTs are examined for their effectiveness in leading to moderately extreme temperatures (at each location) using an index that measures the contribution to extreme days with respect to the contribution to non-extreme days. Correlation between regional extreme series and CTs frequency is also tested. In spring, the decrease in cold nights, which is notable in the 1970s onwards, can be partially attributable to a downtrend in the frequency of Northerly flow. High frequency of Anticyclone in North Iberia in the 1980s and 1990s has contributed to an increase in warm days in West and North stations. To the SE quadrant of the IP, a great part of warm days is related to south-westerly flow, (both) presenting a higher frequency in the 1950s and the 1960s. In summer warm nights increased remarkably to the SE and SW, and may be in part related to uptrends in Iberian thermal low pattern (1950–2003) and North Atlantic Anticyclone (1850–2003) respectively. Warm days have increased remarkably to the NE especially in the 1990s and 2000s, but this is not found to be related to changes in CTs' frequency. Furthermore, the existence of within type changes (variations in Tmax, Tmin and extreme indices within the CTs) points to the identification of other physical factors operating on inter-annual to multidecadal time scales. Thus, the consideration of Sea Surface Temperature (SST) of the East Atlantic Ocean and Iberian soil moisture conditions (by means of a drought index) helps to explain the evolution of extreme temperatures.","Sea level pressure,Within-type changes,Circulation types,Spring and summer warming,Iberian extreme temperatures,"

"noma-based hybrid satellite-uav-terrestrial networks for 6g maritime coverage","2023","Current fifth-generation (5G) networks do not cover maritime areas, causing difficulties in developing maritime Internet of Things (IoT). To tackle this problem, we establish a nearshore network by collaboratively using on-shore terrestrial base stations (TBSs) and tethered unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). These TBSs and UAVs form virtual clusters in a user-centric manner. Within each virtual cluster, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is adopted for agilely including various maritime IoT devices, which are sparsely distributed over the vast ocean. The nearshore network also shares the spectrum with marine satellites. In such a NOMA-based hybrid satellite-UAV-terrestrial network, interference among different network segments, different clusters, and different users occurs. We thereby formulate a joint power allocation problem to maximize the sum rate of the network. Different from existing studies, we use large-scale channel state information (CSI) only for optimization to reduce system overhead. The large-scale CSI is obtained by using the position information of maritime IoT devices. The problem is non-convex with intractable non-linear constraints. We tackle these difficulties by adopting max-min optimization, the auxiliary function method, and the successive convex approximation technique. An iterative power allocation algorithm is accordingly proposed, which is shown to be effective for coverage enhancement by simulations. This shows the potential of NOMA-based hybrid satellite-UAV-terrestrial networks for maritime on-demand coverage.","Satellites,array signal processing,6G maritime coverage,nonorthogonal multiple access,remotely operated vehicles,Internet of Things,joint power allocation problem,maritime IoT devices,convex programming,Marine vehicles,non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA),virtual cluster,Resource management,NOMA-based hybrid satellite-UAV-terrestrial networks,interference,concave programming,maritime Internet,NOMA,minimax techniques,power allocation,marine satellites,optimisation,tethered unmanned aerial vehicles,maritime on-demand coverage,maritime areas,maritime Internet of Things,user-centric manner,satellite-UAV-terrestrial network,radiofrequency interference,iterative methods,autonomous aerial vehicles,on-shore terrestrial base stations,TBSs,nearshore network,nonlinear programming,multi-access systems,Interference,different network segments,MIMO communication,approximation theory,resource allocation,Precoding,UAVs,Hybrid satellite-UAV-terrestrial network,"

"contextual verification for false alarm reduction in maritime anomaly detection","2015","Automated vessel anomaly detection is immensely important for preventing and reducing illegal activities (e.g., drug dealing, human trafficking, etc.) and for effective emergency response and rescue in a country's territorial waters. A major limitation of previously proposed vessel anomaly detection techniques is the high rate of false alarms as these methods mainly consider vessel kinematic information which is generally obtained from AIS data. In many cases, an anomalous vessel in terms of kinematic data can be completely normal and legitimate if the 'context' at the location and time (e.g., weather and sea conditions) of the vessel is factored in. In this paper, we propose a novel anomalous vessel detection framework that utilizes such contextual information to reduce false alarms through 'contextual verification'. We evaluate our proposed framework for vessel anomaly detection using massive amount of real-life AIS data sets obtained from U.S. Coast Guard. Though our study and developed prototype is based on the maritime domain the basic idea of using contextual information through 'contextual verification' to filter false alarms can be applied to other domains as well.","Kinematics,AIS Data,emergency management,vessel kinematic information,Contextual Verification,Trajectory Clustering,Anomaly Detection,contextual verification,US coast guard,Meteorology,False Alarm Reduction,illegal activities,marine engineering,automated vessel anomaly detection,false alarms,Big data,contextual information,Context,false alarm reduction,maritime anomaly detection,Real-time systems,emergency response,Tracking,Trajectory,territorial waters,AIS data,"

In order to improve the reliability of distress message signal sending device based on BeiDou satellite, a prediction method for signal sending time and a prediction method for signal transmitting delay time are firstly proposed based on the deep neural network. In the process of prediction, a lot of sensor information is used, especial in the prediction of signal transmitting delay time, multiple-sampling information from the sensors is adopted.

"uav-enabled accompanying coverage for hybrid satellite-uav-terrestrial maritime communications","2019","Despite of constantly-developing satellites and terrestrial fifth generation (5G) communications, there is still a large gap for maritime broadband coverage. In this paper, we explore the potential gain of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for maritime communications. A hybrid satellite-UAV-terrestrial network is considered, where the UAV is employed to offer an accompanying coverage for mobile ships. We optimize both the trajectory and transmit power of UAV to maximize the minimum of ship's achievable rate. Different from previous studies, we consider a typical composite channel model containing both large-scale and small-scale fading, to cope with the practical propagation environment. Moreover, we assume only the large-scale channel state information (CSI) is known for optimization, because the dynamic small-scale fading cannot be obtained before UAV's flight, whereas the large-scale CSI can be estimated according to the position information of ships. Under this context, an optimization problem is formulated, subject to constraints on UAV's kinematics and communication limitation. We solve the problem which is proved to be non-convex by problem decomposition, successive convex optimization and bisection searching tools.

"maritime anomaly detection based on mean-reverting stochastic processes applied to a real-world scenario","2018","A novel anomaly detection procedure is presented, based on the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) mean-reverting stochastic process. The considered anomaly is a vessel that deviates from a planned route, changing its nominal velocity. In order to hide this behavior, the vessel switches off its Automatic Identification System (AIS) device for a certain time, and then tries to revert to the previous nominal velocity. The decision that has to be taken is either declaring that a deviation happened or not, relying only upon two consecutive AIS contacts. A proper statistical hypothesis testing procedure that builds on the changes in the OU process long-term velocity parameter of the vessel is the core of the proposed approach and enables for the solution of the anomaly detection problem.","real-world data,Anomaly detection,Marine vehicles,mean-reverting stochastic process,security of data,maritime security,Stochastic processes,proper statistical hypothesis testing procedure,target tracking,statistical analysis,Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process,OU process long-term velocity parameter,automatic identification system,automatic identification system device,stochastic processes,marine engineering,AIS,nominal velocity,Artificial intelligence,maritime anomaly detection,vessel switches,Trajectory,statistical hypothesis test,Ornstein-Uhlenbeck,Transponders,planned route,Navigation,"
"enabling cybersecurity incident reporting and coordinated handling for maritime sector","2019","The maritime industry is experiencing a new era of digital transformation. At the same time as the number of cyberattacks and cybersecurity incidents are increasing, cybersecurity awareness and incident reporting in this sector remains low. In this paper, we describe a cybersecurity incident reporting system for the maritime industry that aims to address this issue. The work focuses on autonomous and unmanned vessels, but can be equally applied to other areas of the maritime industry. The proposed approach has been evaluated experimentally and the results demonstrate its applicability and feasibility.","security of data,coordinated handling,Data models,Maritime Cybersecurity,Computer security,maritime industry,Artificial intelligence,maritime sector,Smart Ports,cybersecurity incident reporting,digital transformation,Industries,Marine vehicles,cybersecurity awareness,marine engineering,Smart Ships,Cybersecurity Incident Exchange,Global Positioning System,"
"ship collision avoidance behaviour recognition and analysis based on ais data","2022","A novel approach is proposed to automatically identify the ship collision avoidance behaviour from ship trajectories based on an improved Sliding Window Algorithm. The approach has three main stages: (1) determining the ships’ obligations according to the Convention on the International Regulations for Preventing Collision at Sea (COLREGs); (2) assessing the rudder angle according to the true bearing of the target ship; (3) identifying the corresponding ship handling behaviour from the ship trajectory taking into account the Rate of Turn and its derivative based on the Sliding Window Algorithm. Four typical encounter scenarios are studied to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method. The approach is then applied to near collision scenarios identified in the maritime traffic off the continental coast of Portugal, which allowed the characterization of the relative and spatial distributions of the locations at which the ships take evasive manoeuvres. The results show that the approach can be applied to accurately detect the ship collision avoidance behaviour from Automatic Identification System trajectory data, and the characterization of the collision avoidance behaviour can potentially be used by situational awareness systems and as the basis for ship collision avoidance decision-making.","Ship evasive manoeuvring,Near collision scenario,Collision avoidance,Sliding window Algorithm,"
"variability and change in the west antarctic peninsula marine system: research priorities and opportunities","2019","The west Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) region has undergone significant changes in temperature and seasonal ice dynamics since the mid-twentieth century, with strong impacts on the regional ecosystem, ocean chemistry and hydrographic properties. Changes to these long-term trends of warming and sea ice decline have been observed in the 21st century, but their consequences for ocean physics, chemistry and the ecology of the high-productivity shelf ecosystem are yet to be fully established. The WAP shelf is important for regional krill stocks and higher trophic levels, whilst the degree of variability and change in the physical environment and documented biological and biogeochemical responses make this a model system for how climate and sea ice changes might restructure high-latitude ecosystems. Although this region is arguably the best-measured and best-understood shelf region around Antarctica, significant gaps remain in spatial and temporal data capable of resolving the atmosphere-ice-ocean-ecosystem feedbacks that control the dynamics and evolution of this complex polar system. Here we summarise the current state of knowledge regarding the key mechanisms and interactions regulating the physical, biogeochemical and biological processes at work, the ways in which the shelf environment is changing, and the ecosystem response to the changes underway. We outline the overarching cross-disciplinary priorities for future research, as well as the most important discipline-specific objectives. Underpinning these priorities and objectives is the need to better define the causes, magnitude and timescales of variability and change at all levels of the system. A combination of traditional and innovative approaches will be critical to addressing these priorities and developing a co-ordinated observing system for the WAP shelf, which is required to detect and elucidate change into the future.","Primary production,Physical oceanography,Southern Ocean,Ecosystems,Sea ice,Nutrient and carbon cycling,Antarctica,Climate change,West Antarctic Peninsula,"
"synthetic trajectory extraction for maritime anomaly detection","2018","In the maritime domain, the main goal for large vessels is to drive as fast and efficiently as possible from one harbour to the next. This results in vessels following quite distinct routes. Deviations from these routes can be seen as indicators for illegal or at least suspicious behaviour. In order to extract these routes, clustering algorithms can be used, that will store the traffic patterns as synthetic trajectories. A vessel can be assigned to a specific route or a deviation from the routes can be detected by evaluating these route models. A challenge in designing the synthetic trajectories lies in the faithful representation, sparsity of data, treatment of outliers and split-up of routes. Here, a novel approach to model the uncertainty of the vessels movements while following a route is introduced: A cluster is now represented by a trajectory consisting of segments. Due to obstacles like shallow waters, a route might split up which will generate sub-segments. Instead of storing all cluster points, the position, speed, and course of the vessels are attached to each segment in form of normal distributions. Using these attributes, the probability of a deviation from the given trajectory can be estimated.","Clustering algorithms,Kernel,vessels movements,Anomaly detection,anomaly detection,traffic patterns,security of data,trajectory representation,ships,clustering algorithms,marine engineering,maritime domain,Heating systems,route models,pattern clustering,Artificial intelligence,maritime anomaly detection,synthetic trajectory extraction,Trajectory,data sparsity,probability,Gaussian distribution,data handling,"
"geospatial data analysis for global maritime risk assessment using the discrete global grid system","2021","The effective management of the safety of navigation by coastguards is challenged by the complexity in quantifying and describing the relative risk of accidents occurrence. The discovery of patterns in observation data is reliant on the collection and analysis of significant volumes of relevant heterogenous spatial datasets. Conventional approaches of risk mapping which aggregate vessel traffic and incident data into Cartesian grids can result in misrepresentation due to inherent inadequacies in this spatial data format. In this paper, we explore how the Discrete Global Grid System (DGGS) overcomes these limitations through the development of global maps of incident rates at multiple resolutions. The results demonstrate hot spots of relative high risk across different regions and clearly show that DGGS is more suited to global analysis than conventional grids. This work contributes to a greater understanding of both the disposition of maritime risk and the advantages of adopting DGGS in supporting big data analysis.","Risk management,Discrete Global Grid System,Safety,Navigation,Geospatial analysis,Spatial databases,Big Data,Maritime Risk,Automatic Identification System,Graphical models,Planning,"
"atmospheric circulation patterns in the arab region and its relationships with saudi arabian surface climate: a preliminary assessment","2015","This paper establishes and analyses the principal circulation patterns in and around Saudi Arabia (domain: 10°E–70°E; 5°N–40°N) based on the daily mean sea-level pressure (MSLP) 0.75°×0.75° gridded data derived from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) re-analysis ERA-Interim for the period 1979–2012. Association of the circulation patterns to the local climate is investigated using observed daily temperature and rainfall data at 27 locations over Saudi Arabia for the period 1979–2010. Using the widely-used mathematical technique principal component analysis (PCA) we determine with MSLP data the principal patterns. We only analyse data for the wet season (October–May). The automated typing procedure establishes 12 circulation types, which represent all the main synoptic features especially those that originate from the Mediterranean, the European and African continents, Siberia, and also the Red and Arabian seas. There is a strong link between the circulation types and surface climate that is synoptically and spatially interpretable. Particular circulation types are associated with specific climatic conditions across the country: rainfall is linked with Types 9, 10 and 11, whilst warm days (nights) with 1, 2, 3, 9, 10, 11 and 12 (1, 2, 3, 10, 11 and 12), and cold days (nights) with 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 11 and 12 (2, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8). In terms of regional influences, the circulation types also exhibit specific links between certain types and climatic divisions across Saudi Arabia.","Saudi Arabia,Climate patterns,Arabian Peninsula,Circulation,"
"a novel meris algorithm to derive cyanobacterial phycocyanin pigment concentrations in a eutrophic lake: theoretical basis and practical considerations","2014","A novel algorithm is developed and validated to estimate phycocyanin (PC) pigment concentrations of the most common cyanobaterium, Microcystis aeruginosa, in Taihu Lake (China's third largest freshwater lake) using data from the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS). First, a PC index (PCI) is defined as remote-sensing reflectance (Rrs, sr−1) at 620nm normalized against a baseline formed linearly between Rrs(560) and Rrs(665). Because PC has a local absorption peak at ~620nm, PCI is shown in both theory and model simulations to exhibit a monotonic functional relationship with PC concentration. Field measurements also support this hypothesis, from which an empirical algorithm is developed to estimate PC concentrations between ~1 and 300μg/L with unbiased RMS uncertainties of 58%. Radiative transfer simulations further show that such a field-based algorithm can be applied directly to MERIS Rayleigh-corrected reflectance (Rrc) after adjusting algorithm coefficients. Spectral analyses and image comparisons indicate that such an algorithm is nearly immune to perturbations from thick aerosols, thin clouds, significant sun glint, and extreme water turbidity. Mean usable data coverage increases from <1% to >50% when using Rrc as compared to Rrs processed using standard atmospheric correction algorithms in SeaDAS. The robust algorithm performance and significantly improved data coverage lead to the establishment of a long-term (2002–2012) time-series of PC concentrations in Taihu Lake, which show both seasonal and inter-annual changes. Test of the algorithm over other lakes, including Dianchi Lake (a typical plateau lake of China), suggests that the same band-subtraction approach might be applicable to other inland water bodies, although local bio-optical conditions due to different sediment and phytoplankton compositions need to be considered when applying such an empirical approach.","Aerosols,MERIS,Phycocyanin,Remote sensing,Lake Taihu,Sun glint,Clouds,Chlorophyll-a,"
"gps based system for detection and control of maritime boundary intruding boats","2016","Maritime boundary violation and intrusion by fishing boats has been a huge concern not only for the errant fishermen and their families but also a massive burden on governments and public alike, due to the complexity of the issue and the naivety of the people involved. The chief solution is to safe guard these fishermen from the danger which they are encountering in everyday life for their livelihood. Hence, keeping the above problems in mind, this paper proposes a GPS based boat detection and tracking system which would safe guard the fishermen from the potential dangers they might face by giving them pre-warning in case of trespassing. In particular, we are proposing to control the navigation so that the fishermen are directed to safe region. This system was designed and demonstrated already. In the proposed system, the maritime boundary is detected using GPS in real time but for our demonstration purposes, RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) readers and tags were used in which the location detection and retrieval was followed by the vital information being sent to the Peripheral Interface Controller (PIC) for taking corresponding actions.","maritime boundary violation,Radiofrequency identification,Monitoring,maritime boundary intruding boat detection,Global Positioning System,PIC,ZigBee,military systems,navigation control,microcontrollers,location retrieval,object tracking,marine safety,peripheral interface controller,fishing boats,boats,RFID,object detection,peripheral interfaces,Real-time systems,GPS,RFID readers,location detection,radiofrequency identification,Zigbee,maritime boundary intruding boat control,trespassing,Boats,Protocols,RFID tags,GPS based boat detection and tracking system,"
"ocean of things : affordable maritime sensors with scalable analysis","2019","DARPA's Ocean of Things (OoT) program enables persistent maritime situational awareness over large ocean areas by deploying thousands of low-cost, intelligent floats that drift as a distributed sensor network. Each float manages a suite of commercially available sensors to collect environmental data such as sea surface temperature, sea state, and location as well as activity data about vessels and marine mammals moving across the ocean. The floats periodically transmit processed data, or immediately report events based on internal prioritization schemes. Messages travel via commercial satellite to a government cloud for storage and real-time analysis. Cloud-based data analytics feature machine learning aimed at discovering emergent features and behaviors from sparse data. The multiple performers manufacturing floats and developing software are being led by a government management team to employ commercial design methodology and agile best practices. At-sea float deployments are planned in two phases over 2019 (1-month) and 2020 (3-month).

"maritime pattern extraction from ais data using a genetic algorithm","2016","The long term prediction of maritime vessels' destinations and arrival times is essential for making an effective logistics planning. As ships are influenced by various factors over a long period of time, the solution cannot be achieved by analyzing sailing patterns of each entity separately. Instead, an approach is required, that can extract maritime patterns for the area in question and represent it in a form suitable for querying all possible routes any vessel in that region can take. To tackle this problem we use a genetic algorithm (GA) to cluster vessel position data obtained from the publicly available Automatic Identification System (AIS). The resulting clusters are treated as route waypoints (WP), and by connecting them we get nodes and edges of a directed graph depicting maritime patterns. Since standard clustering algorithms have difficulties in handling data with varying density, and genetic algorithms are slow when handling large data volumes, in this paper we investigate how to enhance the genetic algorithm to allow fast and accurate waypoint identification. We also include a quad tree structure to preprocess data and reduce the input for the GA. When the route graph is created, we add post processing to remove inconsistencies caused by noise in the AIS data. Finally, we validate the results produced by the GA by comparing resulting patterns with known inland water routes for two Dutch provinces.","data mining,Clustering algorithms,Genetic algorithms,vessel position data cluster,marine navigation,directed graph,maritime pattern extraction,sailing pattern analysis,quadtrees,Biological cells,genetic algorithms,genetic algorithm,ships,Genetic Algorithms,automatic identification system,inland water routes,Dutch provinces,logistics planning,Automatic Identification System,quad tree structure,Data Mining,directed graphs,pattern clustering,Artificial intelligence,route querying,maritime vessel destination prediction,Pattern Recognition,Logistics,Synchromodal Logistics,long term prediction,route waypoints,Boats,logistics data processing,Data mining,AIS data,arrival time prediction,data handling,"

"clutter suppression and target tracking by the low-rank representation for airborne maritime surveillance radar","2020","Moving target detection is of vital importance to maritime security and maritime resource protection. However, the detection of slow or weak targets is difficult based on traditional methods. A new detection method is proposed by using the different motion variations of radar moving target and sea clutter in the range-Doppler spectrum sequence. The first step in implementing this method is the separation of moving target and sea clutter by the low-rank representation, in which the target and clutter are modeled as foreground and background components. Subsequently, a sea clutter discriminator is constructed within the sea clutter bandwidth to further remove the sea clutter (false alarms) that exists in the foreground. The proposed method can reduce the sea clutter power while maintaining the target power and improve the detection rate of moving targets, especially slow or weak targets. Data collected with airborne maritime surveillance radar in maritime moving target indication (MMTI) mode are used to validate the performance of the proposed method. The experimental results demonstrate that the improvement in the signal-to-clutter ratio (SCR) obtained with the proposed method is better than that obtained with space-time adaptive processing (STAP, including 1DT-STAP, 3DT-STAP and sparse-STAP) and principal component pursuit (PCP) methods; additionally, the figure of merit (FOM) of the proposed method is higher than that of the constant false alarm rate (CFAR) and PCP method.

"ais data visualization for maritime spatial planning (msp)","2016","The constant increase in marine traffic and the simultaneous growth of the demand for exploiting marine areas (e.g., installing offshore wind power plants) require an adequate planning strategy for managing high traffic volumes. Maritime Spatial Planning (MSP) is the process of public development of an allocation plan for distributing, both spatially and temporally, human activities in marine areas. The adoption of e-Navigation is a possible solution for improving safety and security at sea by integrating maritime information on board and ashore. Automatic Identification System (AIS) data represents a fundamental source of information, since the analysis of AIS data can highlight the presence of congested areas as well as of illegal actions, such as smuggling, pollution, and unauthorized phishing in protected areas. Indeed, those activities are often characterized by abnormal manoeuvres that can be recognized by analyzing the routes of the vessels. However, the huge dimension of the AIS data to process requires the adoption of careful strategies for the data visualization. In this paper, we present a complete pipeline for visualizing ship routes from raw AIS data, which is a fundamental pre-requisite for carrying out a significant AIS-based route analysis, and describe a real case study, where 90 million AIS records, corresponding to one month of world-wide observations, are visualized using only open-source software.","AIS data visualization,route analysis,intelligent transport systems,e-Navigation,AIS data,"
"a hybrid robotic network for maritime situational awareness: results from the infore22 sea trial","2022","In this paper we describe an integrated system for maritime situational awareness (MSA) applications, built on a cooperative autonomous robotic network, and developed in the maritime use case of the INFORE EU H2020 project. INFORE project developed an interactive, real-time, extreme-scale analytics and forecasting system for handling and analysing massive streams of data. The MSA INFORE system exploits the synergy between global view (AIS data, ESA Sentinel satellite data), which provide contextual information over a wide area, and local view produced by a sensorised hybrid robotic network. Such a network was validated during the INFORE22 sea trial, held off the coast of Portovenere, Italy, in the Gulf of La Spezia, in February-March 2022. It was composed of a thermal camera and of two autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) equipped with passive sonars. The robots fused their measurements, and cooperatively adapted their navigation for localising a suspicious vessel, communicating her position to the MSA INFORE platform in real-time. For controlling the robots, we developed a perception layer, based on an occupancy grid map framework, which enabled the fusion of passive sonar bearing-only measurements for target localisation. The perception layer was also the basis for making cooperative decisions to adapt the network spatial configuration for improving mission performance. In this paper we report and discuss results from the INFORE22 trial. These results are one the first demonstrations of how data fusion and cooperative autonomy can increase the performance of a complex robotic network in a passive sonar surveillance mission in a real-world scenario.

"area decomposition algorithm for large region maritime search","2020","In this paper, an area decomposition algorithm is presented that is suitable for multiple vessels and multiple aircraft participating in maritime searches over a large region. The algorithm can decompose the entire sea region to be searched (deemed as polygonal area) into nonoverlapping subpolygons (search subareas) according to the sizes of the areas covered by various search facilities while considering their search capabilities as well as their corresponding commence search points. The algorithm draws on the concept of a polygon division algorithm in computational geometry. The main novelty in this study is the optimization of the classic polygon division algorithm by introducing a â€œmaximizing-minimum-angleâ€ strategy, which can effectively compensate for the deficiency of the traditional algorithm, as reflected in the area decomposition result. This improved algorithm can produce rectangle-like subareas, especially for a rectangular search region, which is commonly used in maritime search operations. For nonrectangular search regions, a right-angle division can be achieved so that the shapes of the search subareas are more conducive to planning specific search routes for search facilities. Fast maritime search coverage over a large region can be achieved. The effectiveness of the algorithm is validated by comparing decomposition results before and after the improvement.","area decomposition result,maritime search coverage,search facilities,Vehicle dynamics,maritime searches,search capabilities,area decomposition,Aircraft navigation,Maritime search,entire sea region,Search problems,specific search routes,classic polygon division algorithm,corresponding commence search points,marine safety,optimisation,search facility,Shape,maritime search operations,search subarea,multiple aircraft,polygonal area,Partitioning algorithms,multiple vessels,search problems,Legged locomotion,search subareas,rectangular search region,computational geometry,nonrectangular search regions,region maritime search,Heuristic algorithms,area decomposition algorithm,"
"salinity and temperature profiling for the submarine groundwater discharge simulations: quantification through heat and solute transport model","2022","Developed coastal regions are the hotspots for contaminated groundwater discharge, affecting sensitive marine ecosystems. The present study aims to identify submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) locations and quantify the contaminant load reaching to the western coast of India (Gujarat coast) using stable isotopes, seepage meter, heat and solute transport model. The coastal aquifers are highly enriched in trace metals due to various active natural processes and anthropogenic activities across the coast. Terrestrial and recirculated SGD was a significant contributor to flow and metal load, which ranged from 1.04 to 181.1 m3.year−1 and 0–77.41 kg.year-1, respectively. The highest estimated SGD in the Gujarat coast was relatively less than the SGD reported in the Bay of Bengal and comparable to the South Chennai coast. The order of metal flux found in the study was Zn > Fe > Cr > Pb > Ni > Cu > Mn, whereas the highest flux of Zn (77.41 kg. year−1) was reported at Fansa beach, which was 7x Fe-flux and 45 x Cr-flux, respectively. Higher micronutrients (Fe and Zn) load in the southern coast leads to increased vulnerability of eutrophication, algal blooms and biotic ligand formation in aquatic species. This enrichment of micronutrients in the coastal ecosystem was evident by the growth of seaweeds on the seabed at SGD identified locations.","Numerical modelling,Metal load,SGD,Quantification,Seepage meter,Gujarat coast,"
"on the effectiveness of ai-assisted anomaly detection methods in maritime navigation","2020","The automatic identification system (AIS) has become an essential tool for maritime security. Nevertheless, how to effectively use the static and dynamic voyage information of the AIS data in maritime traffic situation awareness is still a challenge. This paper presents a comparative study of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques on their effectiveness in dealing with various anomalies in maritime domain using the AIS data. The AIS on-off switching (OOS) anomaly is critical in maritime security, since AIS technology is susceptible to manipulation and it can be switched on and off to hide illegal activities. Thus, we try to detect and distinguish between intentional and non-intentional AIS OOS anomalies through our AI -assisted anomaly detection framework. We use AIS data, in particular positional and navigational status of vessels, to study the effectiveness of seven AI techniques, such as artificial neural network, support vector machine, logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, decision tree, random forest and naive Bayes, in detecting the AIS OOS anomalies. Our experimental results show that ANN and SVM are the most suitable techniques in detecting the AIS OOS anomalies with 99.9% accuracy.

"enabling maritime risk assessment using natural language processing-based deep learning techniques","2020","Maritime vessels around the world risk encountering dangerous situations during their voyages such as piracy, kidnappings, hijackings, and smugglings. Such dangers may put crews at risk and potentially cause extensive damage to both the vessel and its cargo. Maritime risk assessment is a process of analyzing such factors to positively impact the safety and timeliness of operations. Analyzing the high-risk areas in seas and oceans can help vessels route around areas with previously recorded high levels of dangerous activities. This information is scraped and extracted from various maritime documents, including newspaper articles, social media, incident blogs, and operational reports. After textual data sources are parsed, it is possible to use this extracted information as training datasets into a Machine Learning (ML) model using Natural Language Processing (NLP) Deep Learning (DL) techniques. With these methods, we can perform document classification, risk extraction, text summarization, topic modeling, and information extraction in an automated manner. Methods that are used include the bag-of words (BOW) approach and, in particular, the use of Named Entity Recognition (NER) to identify specific areas around the world that are considered a risk to a particular voyage. Once this information is processed, the model can determine and aggregate specific areas of high-risk activity. We propose a Maritime Event Log (MEL) pipeline using DL methods. This pipeline includes binary document classification (DC) to extract positive instances of incidents, an incident type classification (IC,) and an information extraction module (IE) including date and location and ship type extraction.

"paleotemperature reconstructions using speleothem fluid inclusion analyses from hungary","2021","The combined use of the stable isotope compositions of speleothem carbonate and inclusion-hosted water presents great potential in paleotemperature reconstructions, due to the various temperature-dependent isotope fractionations detected in cave systems and their environment. This paper evaluates the applicational possibilities of hydrogen and oxygen isotope measurements of inclusion-hosted water and its host calcite, in three different approaches: i) direct determination of calcite-water oxygen isotope fractionation by measuring inclusion water and carbonate compositions, ii) calculation of water oxygen isotope composition from hydrogen isotope data and of temperature from the inferred calcite-water fractionation, and iii) calculation of formation temperature from measured hydrogen isotope data and its temperature dependence in the modern precipitation water. Fluid inclusion oxygen and hydrogen isotope compositions as well as calcite oxygen isotope compositions were determined for five speleothem occurrences in Hungary. Although the background processes are not resolved, calculations involving measured calcite and water oxygen isotope compositions yielded unrealistic paleotemperatures, likely because of syn-formation isotope fractionation processes and diagenetic alterations. The hydrogen isotope data may yield realistic temperatures, provided that long-term isotopic composition - temperature relationships are known and the stable hydrogen isotope composition of the precipitation waters in the study area is temperature-controlled. Winter half-year and annual isotope-temperature relationships (δ2H/T gradients) were calculated using multidecadal isotope composition records from the Global Network of Isotopes in Precipitation (GNIP), gridded surface temperatures, and precipitation amounts from the E-OBS 21.0e database. The calculations yielded a paleotemperature record for the last ~250 ka, with average precisions ranging from ±0.6 °C for interglacial to ±2.4 °C for glacial periods. Clumped isotope analyses of cave-hosted flowstones support the inferred formation temperatures based on gradients, while detection of kinetic fractionations by combined hydrogen and oxygen isotope analyses of calcite and inclusion water lead to filtering clumped isotope (Δ47) data and more coherent Δ47-temperature relationships.","Fluid inclusion,Paleotemperature reconstruction,Clumped isotope,Speleothem,Stable isotope composition,Calcite,"
"an adaptive ionosphere clutter suppression and target detection method for hfswr maritime surveillance","2023","High-frequency surface wave radar (HFSWR) as a maritime surveillance facility faces the tough challenges. One of them is that various unwanted echo components constantly destroy the detection performance of HFSWR, especially the dynamically changing ionosphere clutter. This article proposes an adaptive ionosphere clutter suppression and target detection algorithm (AICSTD) based on improved higher order singular value decomposition (HOSVD) and deep learning network. First, we analyze the multiple-dimensional characteristics of different types of ionosphere clutter echo data. Then, refer to the multichannel HFSWR echo data structure, we apply simplified HOSVD and orthogonal subspace projection to eliminate the unwanted echo component and, meanwhile, preserve the target echo. The key parameter of simplified HOSVD is determined by the mean structural similarity (MSSIM) index, which contributes to reduce the computation complexity of the proposed method. Finally, we improved the deep learning network to detect the targets in various behaviors after the clutter suppression. In order to address the issue of limited clutter data, transfer learning based on historical radar echo data is applied. A thorough experimental analysis on various real clutter data shows that the proposed method performs competitively. Our method shows a superior performance over many state-of-the-art clutter suppression methods, with a covered target detection accuracy of 92.4% under strong spread clutter background.","Ionosphere,structural similarity (SSIM) index,higher order singular value decomposition (HOSVD),ionosphere clutter suppression,Tensors,Clutter,Deep learning,Object detection,Doppler effect,target detection,high-frequency surface wave radar (HFSWR),Reflection,"

"characterizing the vertical profile of aerosol particle extinction and linear depolarization over southeast asia and the maritime continent: the 2007–2009 view from caliop","2013","Vertical profiles of 0.532μm aerosol particle extinction coefficient and linear volume depolarization ratio are described for Southeast Asia and the Maritime Continent. Quality-screened and cloud-cleared Version 3.01 Level 2 NASA Cloud Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) 5-km Aerosol Profile datasets are analyzed from 2007 to 2009. Numerical simulations from the U.S. Naval Aerosol Analysis and Predictive System (NAAPS), featuring two-dimensional variational assimilation of NASA Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer and Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer quality-assured datasets, combined with regional ground-based lidar measurements, are considered for assessing CALIOP retrieval performance, identifying bias, and evaluating regional representativeness. CALIOP retrievals of aerosol particle extinction coefficient and aerosol optical depth (AOD) are high over land and low over open waters relative to NAAPS (0.412/0.312 over land for all data points inclusive, 0.310/0.235 when the per bin average is used and each is treated as single data points; 0.102/0.151 and 0.086/0.124, respectively, over ocean). Regional means, however, are very similar (0.180/0.193 for all data points and 0.155/0.159 when averaged per normalized bin), as the two factors offset one another. The land/ocean offset is investigated, and discrepancies attributed to interpretation of particle composition and a-priori assignment of the extinction-to-backscatter ratio (“lidar ratio”) necessary for retrieving the extinction coefficient from CALIOP signals. Over land, NAAPS indicates more dust present than CALIOP algorithms are identifying, indicating a likely assignment of a higher lidar ratio representative of more absorptive particles. NAAPS resolves more smoke over water than identified with CALIOP, indicating likely usage of a lidar ratio characteristic of less absorptive particles to be applied that biases low AOD there. Over open waters except within the Bay of Bengal, aerosol particle scattering is largely capped below 1.5km MSL, though ground-based lidar measurements at Singapore differ slightly from this finding. Significant aerosol particle presence over land is similarly capped near 3.0km MSL over most regions. Particle presence at low levels regionally, except over India, is dominated by relatively non-depolarizing particles. Industrial haze, sea salt droplets and fresh smoke are thus most likely present.","Southeast Asia,Lidar,Aerosol particle scattering,CALIPSO,Aerosol composition,Maritime Continent,"
"palaeomagnetism and magnetic anisotropy of carboniferous red beds from the maritime provinces of canada: evidence for shallow palaeomagnetic inclinations and implications for north american apparent polar wander","2010","A palaeomagnetic and magnetic anisotropy study was conducted on the lower-middle Carboniferous Maringouin and Shepody red bed formations of the Maritime Provinces of Canada to detect and correct inclination shallowing. Because of the shallow inclinations commonly observed in red beds and the strong dependence of North America's Palaeo-Mesozoic apparent polar wander (APW) on red beds, inclination shallowing may substantially affect large portions of North America's APW path. Hematite is the primary magnetic mineral carrier in these red beds, accompanied by secondary magnetite, maghemite, goethite and pigmentary hematite. Thermal and chemical demagnetization of the Shepody Fm. successfully isolated characteristic remanence directions of D= 177Â°, I= 20.4Â°, Î±95= 6.5Â°, N= 19 and D= 177.8Â°I= 17.7Â°, Î±95= 6.9Â°, N= 16, respectively. Thermal demagnetization of the Maringouin Fm. isolated a characteristic remanence direction of D= 178.7Â°, I= 24.9Â°, Î±95= 14.5Â°, N= 9.High field anisotropy of isothermal remanence followed by alternating field and thermal cleaning on leached samples was used to isolate the fabric of hematite. Individual particle anisotropy was measured directly from magnetic separates using a new technique. Hematite's magnetic fabric and particle anisotropy were used to apply an inclination correction. Our inclination corrections indicate up to 10Â° of inclination shallowing, corresponding to corrected palaeopole positions of 27.2Â°N, 118.3Â°E, A95= 6.2Â° and 27.4Â°N, 117.2Â°E, A95= 13.1Â° for the Shepody and Maringouin formations, respectively. This correction corresponds to a âˆ¼ 6Â° increase in colatitude for Carboniferous North America, which translates into approximately a 650 km change in North America's palaeogeographic position. The proposed position of North America supports a Pangea B-type reconstruction.","Palaeomagnetism applied to Tectonics,Magnetic mineralogy and petrology,Palaeomagnetism applied to geologic processes,Magnetic fabrics and anisotropy,Rock and mineral magnetism,"

"magnetic detection of ship ballast deposits and anchorage sites in king herod's roman harbour, caesarea maritima, israel","2009","Ballast stone deposits are a common feature of sediments in ancient harbour basins but are often overlooked as a potential source of archaeological information. Recent geophysical investigations at Caesarea Maritima in Israel have discovered a thick, laterally extensive ballast layer in the area seaward of the 1st c. BC Roman harbour. The ballast deposits were identified by low-relief mounds on the seabed with elevated magnetic intensities. Jet probing and excavation of magnetic anomalies at several locations revealed a 20–60cm thick rubble layer containing large quantities of Late Roman and Byzantine pottery, local sedimentary boulders (kurkar sandstone, limestone cobbles) and foreign igneous and metamorphic boulders (granite, schist, volcanics; ca. 50%). The foreign boulders and pottery identify the rubble layer as ballast and ships refuse jettisoned by merchant ships outside the harbour. The strong magnetic contrast between the ballast deposits and the natural seabed sediments is attributed to the high magnetic susceptibility (>10−3SI) of crystalline boulders and pottery materials within the ballast rubble. AMS 14C and OSL dates and pottery evidence indicate the ballast accumulation began in the Late Roman period (ca. 200–330 AD) and continued well into the Late Byzantine (ca. 7th c. AD). The main phase of ballast deposition (ca. 4th–5th c. AD) coincided with a decline in the state of Caesarea's harbour following a destructive tsunami event in the early 2nd c. AD and records a shift to a more intensive use of the area seaward of the harbour as an anchorage and ballast lightening area.","Harbour,Magnetic survey,Caesarea Maritima,Ballast,Anchorages,"

The localization is achieved by what is essentially a multilateration technique, which can be applied while the transmitting platform is also in motion. The algorithms and the accuracy predictions, as a function of the number of transmitters, have been experimentally confirmed via a dedicated experimental campaign, where two different maritime targets were detected by up to 12 GNSS satellites belonging to different satellite constellations (GPS, GLONASS, and Galileo) simultaneously.

"glacial geology as a key to geochemical exploration in areas of glacial overburden with particular reference to canada","1973","The applicability of geochemical exploration procedures in previously glaciated areas is largely a function of the nature of the glacial sediments. A considerable diversity of glacial sediments and landforms results from a phase of glaciation, these products bearing variable compositional relationships to the local bedrock, and thus have varying usefulness in geochemical exploration. A classification of glacial sediments and landforms is described, with emphasis being placed on the provenance of the material composing the different types. The nature and extent of the Wisconsin glaciation in Canada is summarized, together with a review of the distribution of glacial sediments and landforms. Variations in the nature of the glaciation and the distribution of different glacial sediments and landforms have contributed to the situation that the applicability of geochemical exploration techniques varies across Canada. The nature of metal dispersion in glacial sediments resulting directly from glacial activity is discussed, particular reference being given to those features that have proved effective in geochemical exploration. The role of dispersion patterns in glacial sediments and landforms is discussed with regard to varying scales of geochemical exploration programs. Variations in the distribution of glacial sediments and the nature of associated dispersion patterns, both on the regional and local scales, make a consideration of the glacial geology an essential feature for the implementation of appropriate geochemical exploration procedures.",""
"detection of ais messages falsifications and spoofing by checking messages compliance with tdma protocol","2023","Automatic identification system is a navigation aid system that allows vessels to exchange automatically positions, identity and other information. It improves the safety of the maritime traffic and helps to monitor it. However, this system can be manipulated to send falsified information and to mask illicit activities. While previous research has proposed strategies to detect these threats, none of them suggest a solution that considers the time-division multiple access (TDMA) communication protocol. In this work, the compliance of the sent messages with this protocol, specified by the system's standard, is checked for every ship to detect message falsifications. Furthermore, because the ships velocity affects TDMA protocol, a strategy based a Kalman filter is applied to track every ship and to assess the consistency of their velocity data sent. The proposed strategy was validated on real data and showed very promising results. Being computationally cheap, the method can be run in real time. Source codes of the method are open-source to foster research activities from both industry and academia in this field.","Automatic Identification System (AIS),Spoofing detection,TDMA protocol,Falsifications detection,Kalman filtering,"

"unsupervised hierarchical methodology of maritime traffic pattern extraction for knowledge discovery","2022","Owing to the space–air–ground integrated networks (SAGIN), seaborne shipping has attracted increasing interest in the research on the motion behavior knowledge extraction and navigation pattern mining problems in the era of maritime big data for improving maritime traffic safety management. This study aims to develop a novel unsupervised methodology for feature extraction and knowledge discovery based on automatic identification system (AIS) data, allowing for seamless knowledge transfer to support trajectory data mining. The unsupervised hierarchical methodology is constructed from three parts: trajectory compression, trajectory similarity measure, and trajectory clustering. In the first part, an adaptive Douglas–Peucker with speed (ADPS) algorithm is created to preserve critical features, obtain useful information, and simplify trajectory information. Then, dynamic time warping (DTW) is utilized to measure the similarity between trajectories as the critical indicator in trajectory clustering. Finally, the improved spectral clustering with mapping (ISCM) is presented to extract vessel traffic behavior characteristics and mine movement patterns for enhancing marine safety and situational awareness. Comprehensive experiments are conducted and implemented in the Chengshan Jiao Promontory in China to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the novel methodology. Experimental results show that the proposed methodology can effectively compress the trajectories, determine the number of clusters in advance, guarantee the clustering accuracy, and extract useful navigation knowledge while significantly reducing the computational cost. The clustering results are further explored and follow the Gaussian mixture distribution, which can help provide new discriminant criteria for trajectory clustering.","Trajectory compression,Pattern extraction,Maritime traffic safety management,Knowledge discovery,Trajectory clustering,"
"a data mining method to extract traffic network for maritime transport management","2023","Maritime traffic network is essential for navigation efficiency and safety of the maritime transport system. This study proposes a framework for extracting maritime traffic network based on Automatic Identification System (AIS) data. The framework consists of maritime traffic pattern recognition, semantic routes extraction, route decomposition, and network generation. Firstly, a data-driven method is introduced to recognize ship behavior patterns and extends the single ship behaviors to regional characteristics to determine the departure-arrival areas. Then, based on the different combination of departure-arrival areas, the ship trajectories are classified to traffic groups. Subsequently, the grid-system is used to rasterize each traffic group, which realizes the fusion of trajectory data and geographic location information. Finally, to obtain the main routes and navigation channels, the extraction method is introduced by establishing the cumulative grid importance function. The main routes, together with the navigation channels, compose the maritime traffic network. The method is applied to AIS data in the Beibu Gulf, and the results show that the traffic network contains 12 stop areas, 4 entry/exit locations, 13 main routes as well as their corresponding navigation channels. It is therefore concluded that the proposed method helps (1) provide a theoretical framework to obtain and analyze the maritime traffic network and (2) enrich navigation channel identification methods for maritime transport management.","Maritime traffic network,Maritime transport management,AIS,Machine learning,Big data analytics,"

However, the key challenge it faces is false target suppression. Especially for the moving vessels on the ocean, the existence of false targets will increase false alarm probability and affect the interpretation of SAR images.

"deep learning-powered vessel trajectory prediction for improving smart traffic services in maritime internet of things","2022","The maritime Internet of Things (IoT) has recently emerged as a revolutionary communication paradigm where a large number of moving vessels are closely interconnected in intelligent maritime networks. However, the tremendous growth of vessel trajectories, collected from the combined satellite-terrestrial AIS (automatic identification system) base stations, could lead to unsatisfactory maritime safety and efficacy. To promote smart traffic services in maritime IoT, it is necessary to accurately and robustly predict the spatiotemporal vessel trajectories. It is beneficial for collision avoidance, maritime surveillance, and abnormal behavior detection, etc. Motivated by the strong learning capacity of deep neural networks, this work proposes an AIS data-driven trajectory prediction framework, whose main component is a long short term memory (LSTM) network. In particular, the vessel traffic conflict situation modeling, generated using the dynamic AIS data and social force concept, is embedded into the LSTM network to guarantee high-accuracy vessel trajectory prediction. In addition, a mixed loss function is reconstructed to make our prediction results more reliable and robust in different navigation environments.

"permeability and voids influence on the thermal signal, as inferred by multitemporal uav-based infrared and visible images","2020","This work presents for the first time associated thermal anomalies and deformations over subsurface cavities/voids located within two harbour quays in Le Havre Harbourg, Normandy, France. An U.A.V. (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) was used to acquire visible and thermal images over a diurnal cycle (from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m.). The visible images were processed to realize an altimetric model of the platforms by mean of the photogrammetric method, while the thermal infrared (TIR) images were used to study the evolution of their surface temperatures. The obtained 3D model shows the location of five topographic depressions on both quays. The analysis of the evolution of the surface thermal field leads to the detection of cold thermal anomalies that are (1) not correlated to surface properties, and (2) spatially associated to the flanks of the five topographic depressions. Using a 2D conductive-radiative model, we show that these anomalies are not directly due to the thermally insulating effect of an air-filled area. Finally, we conclude that preferential infiltration and subsequent evaporation in the micro-fracturation present within the flanks of the depressions may be responsible for the strong cooling of these zones.","Thermal infrared,Photogrammetry,Remote Sensing,infiltration,Subsurface cavity,Natural hazards,UAV,"
"the role of sea ice formation in cycling of aluminium in northern marguerite bay, antarctica","2010","The use of dissolved Al as a tracer for oceanic water masses and atmospheric dust deposition of biologically important elements, such as iron, requires the quantitative assessment of its sources and sinks in seawater. Here, we address the relative importance of oceanic versus atmospheric inputs of Al, and the relationship with nutrient cycling, in a region of high biological productivity in coastal Antarctica. We investigate the concentrations of dissolved Al in seawater, sea ice, meteoric water and sediments collected from northern Marguerite Bay, off the West Antarctic Peninsula, from 2005 to 2006. Dissolved Al concentrations at 15 m water depth varied between 2 and 27 nM, showing a peak between two phytoplankton blooms. We find that, in this coastal setting, upwelling and incorporation of waters from below the surface mixed layer are responsible for this peak in dissolved Al as well as renewal of nutrients. This means that changes in the intensity and frequency of upwelling events may result in changes in biological production and carbon uptake. The waters below the mixed layer are most likely enriched in Al as a result of sea ice formation, either causing the injection of Al-rich brines or the resuspension of sediments and entrainment of pore fluids by brine cascades. Glacial, snow and sea ice melt contribute secondarily to the supply of Al to surface waters. Total particulate Al ranges from 93 to 2057 mg/g, and increases with meteoric water input towards the end of the summer, indicating glacial runoff is an important source of particulate Al. The (Al/Si)opal of sediment core top material is considerably higher than water column opal collected by sediment traps, indicative of a diagenetic overprint and incorporation of Al at the sediment–water interface. Opal that remains buried in the sediment could represent a significant sink of Al from seawater.","biogeochemistry,nutrients (mineral),trace metals,brines,Antarctica,"

For the first time, high-resolution inorganic geochemistry and framboidal pyrite analyses were applied to decipher depositional condition changes during the mid-Tournaisian event in the Carnic Alps. The predominance of tiny pyrite framboids, high Corg/P, U/Th, and V/Cr ratios, generally higher enrichments of redox-sensitive metals such as Mo, U, V, and depletion in Mn suggest anoxic/euxinic conditions at the sea bottom. Moreover, we found very large anomalous Hg spikes (with maximum values reaching 3650 ppb) for the first time in the mid-Tournaisian deep-water marine succession of the Carnic Alps. Our results suggest intense volcanism during the LASE, which triggered the mid-Tournaisian anoxic event. The most likely candidate for the observed Hg anomalous contents is submarine arc volcanism and hydrothermal activity connected with the collision of the peri-Gondwanan terranes Paleo-Adria and probably Armorican Terrane Assemblage (ATA) and/or Noric terrane during the first phase of the Variscan orogeny.","Anoxia,Organic-rich rocks,Mid-Tournaisian Event,The Lower Alum Shale Event,Mercury,Volcanism,"

"unmanned maritime vehicles, 20 years of commercial and technical evolution","2016","Unmanned Maritime Vehicles (UMVs) have been under development, especially with US Navy research funds, for decades. However, meaningful advances in the commercial sector have only been seen in the past 20 years. In 1997 Bluefin Robotics was formed out of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Sea Grant College Program Autonomous Underwater Vehicle Lab. Since then many other companies have developed and delivered unmanned maritime vehicles. The transition from research topic to commercial technology has not always been easy, but it has been profound. This paper reviews both sub-component technology and UMV system developments over the past twenty years. Both unmanned undersea vehicles (UUVs) and unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) are examined. Key technology topics reviewed include: propulsion, power, positioning, telemetry, and software. Just as the technology of UMVs has evolved so too have their applications. This paper also evaluates the commercial and operational results that have made UMVs ubiquitous in ocean applications. In particular it covers: survey UUVs, buoyancy gliders, persistent and conventional USVs and inspection and intervention UUVs. This paper aims to capture the major technology and mission accomplishments of UMV manufacturers and operators over the past two decades. It is intended to provide a broad overview of the field to inform both commercial and academic participants in the community. Understanding the challenges of the past, and opportunities of the future are key to ongoing development of technologies. This paper assists all those interested in UMVs toward that end.","UMV ubiquitous,UMV manufacturers,Autonomous Underwater Vehicle Lab,buoyancy,sub-component technology,underwater vehicles,UMV operators,ubiquitous computing,Vehicles,Robots,UMV system developments,Telemetry,Buoyancy,Propulsion,Software,commercial-and-technical evolution,unmanned undersea vehicles,unmanned surface vehicles,Batteries,unmanned maritime vehicles,USV,buoyancy gliders,ocean applications,UUV,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Sea Grant College Program,"
"security and qos issues in blockchain enabled next-generation smart logistic networks: a tutorial","2022","The blockchain-enabled smart logistics market is expected to grow worth USD 1620 billion and at a compound annual growth rate of 62.4%. Smart logistics ensures intelligence infrastructure, logistics automation, real-time analysis of supply chain data synchronization of the logistics process, cost transparency, unbroken shipment tracking all the way down to the transportation route, etc. In the smart logistics domain, significant advancement and growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) sensors are evident. However, the connectivity of IoT systems, including Tactile Internet, without proper safeguards creates vulnerabilities that can still be deliberately or inadvertently cause disruption. In view of this, we primarily notice two key issues. Firstly, the logistics domain can be compromised by a variety of natural or man-made activities, which eventually affect the overall network security. Secondly, there are thousands of entities in the supply chain network that use extensive machine-learning algorithms in many scenarios, and they require high-power computational resources. From these two challenges, we note that the first concern can be addressed by adding blockchain to IoT logistic networks. The second issue can be addressed using 6G. This will support 1-μs latency communications, support seamless computing at the edges of networks, and autonomously predict the best optimal location for edge computing. Motivated by this, we have highlighted motivational examples to show the necessity to integrate 6G and blockchain in smart logistic networks. Then, we have proposed a 6G and blockchain-enabled smart logistic high-level framework. We have presented the key intrinsic issues of this framework mainly from the security and resource management context. In this paper, recent state-of-the-art advances in blockchain enabled next-generation smart logistic networks are analyzed. We have also examined why 6G and not 5G would be compatible with the smart network. We have introduced five different use cases of blockchain technology in smart logistics. Later, this paper discusses some important concerns that blockchain in smart logistics might face. We have also provided potential solutions to tackle these concerns.","Smart logistics,Blockchain,6G,Internet of Things,Security,5G,"
"real-time infrared horizon detection in maritime and land environments based on hyper-laplace filter and convolutional neural network","2023","The infrared (IR) horizon is an essential reference for near-ground state awareness and target detection. The traditional horizon detection algorithms based on hand-crafted features claim the advantage of being intuitive and highly targeted, however, their capability of detail extraction and robustness is not strong enough when switching among diverse scenes, meanwhile, the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have the powerful ability in feature acquisition, but has the disadvantages of interpretability and instability. Given this, this article proposes a novel horizon detection algorithm that combines the traditional method and CNN. First, the hyper-Laplace filter (HLF) is proposed to eliminate the interferences and enhance the saliency of the target. Then a positioning module (PM) based on the traditional idea which fully utilizes the structural characteristics of multifeature-maps in CNN is present to extract the endpoints of the horizon. Finally, an auxiliary module that consists of a revise branch (RB) and self-attention module (SAM) is designed to assist the PM with detailed corrections. Compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms, experiments based on three datasets with more than 25000 frames under various scenes demonstrate that the proposed algorithm not only achieves the best accuracy and highest stability but also addresses real-time needs. Notably, the detection deviation is controlled within 2 pixels on all three datasets while achieving a comparable detection speed of 170 frames/s. Besides, our algorithm also shows strong robustness even under harsh sea conditions and urban backgrounds.

"automatic ship route design between two ports: a data-driven method","2020","With the forced installation of the ship's automatic identification system (AIS), a large amount of ship trajectory data in the world is generated. These data provide information on latitude, longitude, speed and course, and plenty of materials for maritime pattern extraction and vessel behavior prediction. And how to dig into these AIS data deeply to discover the ship behavior pattern is an important job. There are two key points on the automatic ship route design research: the turning area generation and the turning area linkage. In this paper, we integrate DBSCAN and Artificial Neural Network capable of automatic ship route design based on massive AIS data between certain ports. The main purpose of this study is to recognize the key regions by applying DBSCAN algorithm and then connect these regions automatically by cluster similarity measuring. Then artificial neural network has been used to learn the relationship of turning regions and generate a reasonable route with different ship dimensions. The main achievement of this study have twofold. First, a research framework for automatic generation of ship route is proposed. We can process big AIS data and use them to generate ship route. Second, generation of different routes according to ships of different dimension under the research framework. The method is capable of generating ship route automatically according to different ship dimensions, which has been evaluated on two real routes around the world.","DBSCAN algorithm,Data-driven,Ship dimensions,Ship route design,ANN,"
"environment-aware coverage optimization for space-ground integrated maritime communications","2020","To satisfy the growing demand for broadband maritime communications, space-ground integrated maritime communication networks (MCNs) arise, which are envisioned to take full advantage of both satellites and terrestrial shore-based networks. In practice, due to the frequent beam hopping of satellites and the limited number of geographically available onshore base-station sites, the space-ground integrated MCN usually presents a highly non-cellular network structure, leading to both challenging blind zones and coverage areas with severe interference. In this paper, we optimize the coverage performance by exploiting the marine environment information. Particularly, the transmit antenna correlation is estimated using the location and mobility information of scatterers on the sea, such as lighthouses, reefs, islands, and vessels. The position and attitude information of satellites are also utilized for interference estimation. Based on that, we optimize the input covariance and precoding matrix to maximize the ergodic sum capacity for all mobile terminals within the coverage. It is a complicated non-convex problem, especially because the ergodic sum capacity is difficult to be expressed straightly without the expectation operator. We introduce an upper bound of the ergodic sum capacity using the path loss and the transmit antenna correlation estimated from the environment information, and then propose an iterative algorithm to solve the problem by solving a set of convex subproblems. The proposed environment-aware scheme is evaluated using the real-world geographic information of a coastal area of China. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can greatly improve the ergodic sum capacity and the energy efficiency compared with existing approaches, and achieve dynamic coverage to match the non-cellular network structure.","Satellites,complicated nonconvex problem,ergodic sum capacity maximization,space-ground integrated MCN,Antenna arrays,matrix algebra,input covariance optimization,convex programming,path loss,non-cellular,environment-aware coverage optimization,Transmitting antennas,concave programming,coverage performance optimization,beam hopping,space-ground integrated maritime communications,dynamic coverage,environment-aware scheme,precoding matrix,scatterer mobility information,precoding,Maritime communications,broadband maritime communications,Propagation losses,satellite-based networks,real-world geographic information,Correlation,radiofrequency interference,terrestrial shore-based networks,coverage optimization,transmitting antennas,satellite antennas,iterative methods,noncellular network structure,Optimization,onshore base-station sites,broadband networks,marine environment information,marine communication,attitude information,interference estimation,upper bound,transmit antenna correlation,Interference,iterative algorithm,mobile terminals,energy efficiency,"
"enhancing ais to improve whale-ship collision avoidance and maritime security","2009","Whale-ship strikes are of growing worldwide concern due to the steady growth of commercial shipping. Improving the current situation involves the creation of a communication capability allowing whale position information to be estimated and exchanged among vessels and other observation assets. An early example of such a system has been implemented for the shipping lane approaches to the harbor of Boston, Massachusetts where ship traffic transits areas of the Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary frequently used by whales. It uses the Automated Identification Systems (AIS) technology, currently required for larger vessels but becoming more common in all classes of vessels. However, we believe the default mode of AIS operation will be inadequate to meet the long-term needs of whale-ship collision avoidance, and will likewise fall short of meeting other current and future marine safety and security communication needs. This paper explores the emerging safety and security needs for vessel communications, and considers the consequences of a communication framework supporting asynchronous messaging that can be used to enhance the basic AIS capability. The options we analyze can be pursued within the AIS standardization process, or independently developed with attention to compatibility with existing AIS systems. Examples are discussed for minimizing ship interactions with Humpback Whales and endangered North Atlantic Right Whales on the east coast, and North Pacific Right Whales, Bowhead Whales, Humpback Whales, Blue Whales and Beluga Whales in west coast, Alaskan and Hawaiian waters.","marine accidents,North Atlantic right Whales,Whale-ship collision avoidance,Communication system security,Standardization,Marine vehicles,vessel communications,maritime security,Sea measurements,Whale position information,AIS technology,Humpback Whales,ships,marine safety,marine engineering,Collision avoidance,Oceans,Beluga Whales,Boston,automated identification systems technology,North Pacific Right Whales,Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary,Economic forecasting,AIS enhancement,Marine technology,Bowhead Whales,Marine safety,Massachusetts,collision avoidance,Blue Whales,Whales,"
"the vöhrum section (northwest germany) and the aptian/albian boundary","2003","Prior to 1947, the Aptian/Albian boundary was placed at the base of the Nolaniceras nolani ammonite Zone. From (Trav. Lab. Géol. Fac. Sci. 26 (1947) 17), until (Cret. Res. 20 (1999) 609), the base of the Albian stage has been taken at the first appearance of the ammonite Leymeriella (Proleymeriella) schrammeni, a species known only from a limited area of northwest Germany. The early succession of Leymeriella and its relationship with ammonite taxa from the underlying Hypacanthoplites jacobi ammonite Zone can only be determined in the northwest German sections, all of which are ephemeral clay pits. Thus, the definition of the base of the Albian on these criteria cannot be used in a global context. The positioning of the boundary has been the subject of intense discussion in the last years. After the second International Symposium on Cretaceous Stage Boundaries in 1995 (Bull. Inst. R. Sci. Nat. Belgique, Sci. Terre 66 (1996) 45). (Cret. Res. 20 (1999) 609) lowered the boundary to the base of his Hypacanthoplites rubricosus ammonite Subzone without describing a global boundary stratotype section. (Cret. Res. 21 (2000) 591) raised the boundary to the alleged first occurrence (FO) of Leymeriella tardefurcata in a permanent section, but neither proposals can be accepted globally (Cret. Res. 23 (2002) 1). (Cret. Res. 22 (2001) 677) supported by (Cret. Res. 23 (2002) 1), suggested a radical solution by raising the boundary to the base of the geographically widespread Lyelliceras lyelli ammonite Subzone, currently the base of the Middle Albian. In order to document accurately the classical northwest German succession of the Aptian/Albian boundary, a detailed multidisciplinary study has been made of a new section at Vöhrum (clay pit no. 4) with respect to its content of calcareous nannofossils, benthic foraminifera, planktonic foraminifera, ostracods, ammonites, as well as its clay mineralogy, gamma ray signature and tuff geochemistry. The ammonite succession, in particular the Callizoniceras–Leymeriella lineage, is discussed in detail. The FO of Leymeriella (Proleymeriella) schrammeni anterior, 0.65m below a tuff horizon near the base of the section is taken as the Aptian/Albian boundary in the classical German sense. Sections in France are discussed and the Leymeriella lineage is reviewed.","Ostracods,Cretaceous,Northwest Germany,Aptian/Albian boundary,Ammonites,Clay mineralogy,Calcareous nannofossils,Benthic foraminifera,Gamma ray,Tuff geochemistry,Boundary stratotype,"
"method of measuring doppler shift of moving targets using fmcw maritime radar","2013","During the operation of an FMCW (frequency modulated continuous wave) maritime radar, the system transmits a continuous radio energy with a frequency modulated by a triangular or sawtooth-shaped signal. As a result, the frequency of the transmitted signal varies gradually with time. When the signal is reflected by an object, the received waveform will build up a delayed replica of the transmitted waveform, with the time delay as a measure of the target range. If the target is moving, the radar system will register a Doppler shift within the received signal. Compared to the frequency of the emitted signal, the received signal will show a higher frequency when the target is approaching and a lower frequency when the target is moving away from the radar location. Thus, the total Doppler shift may result from the superposition of both source and observer motions. Specifically, the amount of Doppler shift is directly proportional to the radial speed of the target. The Doppler shift can be determined after performing the range Fourier transform (range FFT) first. For a target of interest, we can repeat the range FFT until we have enough data to perform the second level of FFT. The result of this second FFT is a two dimensional complex valued matrix, whose spectral peak corresponds to the Doppler shift of the moving target. This method is known as Doppler FFT. Some results of the measurement of target speed using this method are presented in this paper.","range Fourier transform,FMCW maritime radar,marine radar,moving targets,sawtooth-shaped signal,Radar antennas,two dimensional complex valued matrix,FMCW,CW radar,frequency modulation,fast Fourier transforms,triangular-shaped signal,frequency modulated continuous wave maritime radar,computer simulation,range FFT,radar,radial speed,Doppler shift measurement,target speed measurement,Doppler FFT,FM radar,Radar cross-sections,continuous radio energy,Doppler shift,Frequency modulation,Doppler radar,velocity measurement,"
"prospects and challenges in unlocking natural-gas-hydrate energy in india: recent advancements","2022","Natural gas hydrate deposits hold huge potential as a future energy resource of the world including India. To help realize these resources, India carried out two dedicated research expeditions (NGHP-01 and 02) to identify, characterize and analyze natural gas hydrate resource potential in its maritime boundaries. This work presents a review of the current status of research and development activities in the area of natural gas hydrate systems in India taking a cue from the NGHP-02 research findings. The NGHP-02 is considered one of the most extensive research programs to date for drilling and pressure core collection. This program resulted in minimally disturbed and well-preserved core samples collected from pressure-coring. Logging while drilling, wireline logging, formation pressure testing, vertical seismic profiling, and pressure core analysis confirmed one of the highly saturated (~40%–100%), sand-based, hydrate accumulation in three ultradeep locations, Area B, C, and E, eastern offshore India. The shipborne evaluation helped in the collection of the most suitable core samples to perform the first-ever comprehensive post-cruise triaxial testing, to obtain key petrophysical and geomechanical properties of interest. Further, a suitably designed experimental strategy helped to collect multiple sets of data from utilizing a lesser number of pressure core samples. The most prominent experiments included drained-undrained consolidation and compression, multistage compression and consolidation, alternating strain-rate compression, and permeability evaluation tests. The seal overlying hydrate layer are primarily made of clay rich sediments. The permeability measurements findings of the tested samples were reported in the range of 0.01 to tens of mD depending upon hydrate saturation, sand particle distribution, and range of applied effective stress. Significant permeability loss (∼90%) with increasing effective stress (up to 10 MPa) was noted. Further, permeability anisotropy, a ratio of horizontal to vertical permeability = 4, is reported to be consistent with the values reported for other marine hydrate-bearing sediments. The geochemical analysis put the natural gas to be primarily composed of methane mostly from microbial sources however part contribution from deeper sources was not ruled out. Moreover, numerical modeling of sand migration, thermal characterization, hydrate morphology, and extensive reservoir simulations was also used to obtain greater insight into the nature of the hydrate deposition system and its resource potential. Hydrate occurrences in an ultradeep and shallow subseafloor environment, such as those found in the Krishna-Godavari basin, pose challenge to well bore stability and sustained gas production due to the combined effect of high-pressure drawdown and hydrate dissociation induced strength loss and sand migration. Hence, incorporation of a coupled flow, geomechanical and sand migration analysis in well bore stability and reservoir simulation are suggested as a way forward. The NGHP-02 program and its findings not only advance India's endeavor to locally produce natural gas from these unconventional resources but also provides valuable information concerning exploitation of other marine gas hydrate accumulations found elsewhere in the world.","Gas hydrate reservoir,Logging while drilling,Seismic profile,Pressure core,Reservoir simulation,Geomechanical properties,Krishna-Godavari basin,"

"asynchronous trajectory matching-based multimodal maritime data fusion for vessel traffic surveillance in inland waterways","2023","The automatic identification system (AIS) and video cameras have been widely exploited for vessel traffic surveillance in inland waterways. The AIS data could provide vessel identity and dynamic information on vessel position and movements. In contrast, the video data could describe the visual appearances of moving vessels without knowing the information on identity, position, movements, etc. To further improve vessel traffic surveillance, it becomes necessary to fuse the AIS and video data to simultaneously capture the visual features, identity, and dynamic information for the vessels of interest. However, the performance of AIS and video data fusion is susceptible to issues such as data spatial difference, message asynchronous transmission, visual object occlusion, etc. In this work, we propose a deep learning-based simple online and real-time vessel data fusion method (termed DeepSORVF). We first extract the AIS-and video-based vessel trajectories, and then propose an asynchronous trajectory matching method to fuse the AIS-based vessel information with the corresponding visual targets. In addition, by combining the AIS-and video-based movement features, we also present a prior knowledge-driven anti-occlusion method to yield accurate and robust vessel tracking results under occlusion conditions. To validate the efficacy of our DeepSORVF, we have also constructed a new benchmark dataset (termed FVessel) for vessel detection, tracking, and data fusion. It consists of many videos and the corresponding AIS data collected in various weather conditions and locations. The experimental results have demonstrated that our method is capable of guaranteeing high-reliable data fusion and anti-occlusion vessel tracking. The DeepSORVF code and FVessel dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/gy65896/DeepSORVF and https://github.com/gy65896/FVessel, respectively.","Trajectory,deep neural network,anti-occlusion tracking,Visualization,Radar tracking,Object detection,vessel traffic surveillance,Artificial intelligence,Inland waterways,Surveillance,Data integration,data fusion,"

"satellite multicast transmission scheme in integrated satellite-maritime networks","2020","This paper proposes a maritime transmission scheme in integrated satellite-maritime networks, where the satellite multicast and relay cooperation cooperatively provide the ubiquitous broadband coverage for the whole sea area. Under the proposed network, the maritime users that request the same content or belong to the same fleet can be divided into one user group. Besides, the satellite provides multicast services for the all user groups, while the relay nodes retransmit the signal to other users to reduce the satellite communication cost of user group. However, since the network performance is strongly correlated with satellite links and relay nodes, it is difficult to find out the optimal cooperation solution with low complexity. Meanwhile, the user groups work in the same carrier frequency, which inevitably causes the co-channel interferences among groups. Considering these factors, we propose a cooperative access and power allocation algorithms, respectively. The cooperative access algorithm is based on channel quality and considers the channel quality of satellite and relay node simultaneously.

"genetic structure among breeding herring gulls (larus argentatus) from the great lakes and eastern canada","1999","Herring gulls (Larus argentatus) have been used as sentinel species for exposure to toxic chemicals since the 1960s. Reference populations in these studies have never been characterized to determine whether genetic differences might explain some of the effects seen in gulls at contaminated locations. Previously it was shown that there were higher rates of germline minisatellite DNA mutation rates in herring gulls colonizing sites located near steel industries in urban areas in the Great Lakes. It was suggested that population substructuring among gull colonies could account for differences in the mutation rates observed as a result of surveying different minisatellite loci. Here this explanation is dismissed by showing that genetic exchange among herring gull populations within the Great Lakes appears to be sufficient to ensure genetic homogeneity of these populations; in contrast, differences exist at the minisatellite loci scored between the gulls in the Great Lakes and the Maritimes. It is suggested that reference samples for future Great Lakes herring gull studies be selected from within the Great Lakes, and that potential genetic divergence from Maritime gulls should be investigated in more detail.","Minisatellite DNA,genetic toxicology,Great Lakes,population genetics,herring gull,"

"variability and propagation of labrador sea water in the southern subpolar north atlantic","2009","The variability of two modes of Labrador Sea Water (LSW) (upper and deep Labrador Sea Water) and their respective spreading in the interior North Atlantic Ocean are investigated by means of repeated ship surveys carried out along the zonal WOCE line A2/AR19 located at 43–48°N (1993–2007) and along the GOOS line at about 48–51°N (1997–2002). Hydrographic section data are complemented by temperature, salinity, and velocity time series recorded by two moorings. They have been deployed at the western flank of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR) in the Newfoundland Basin during 1996–2004. The analysis of hydrographic anomalies at various longitudes points to a gradual eastward propagation of LSW-related signals, which happens on time scales of 3–6 years from the formation region towards the MAR. Interactions of the North Atlantic Current (NAC) with the Deep Western Boundary Current (DWBC) close to Flemish Cap point to the NAC being the main distributor of the different types of LSW into the interior of the Newfoundland Basin. Comparisons between the ship data and the mooring records revealed that the mooring sites are located in a region affected by highly variable flow. The mooring time series demonstrate an elevated level of variability with eddy activity and variability associated with the NAC considerably influencing the LSW signals in this region. Hydrographic data taken from Argo profiles from the vicinity of the mooring sites turned out to mimic quite well the temporal evolution captured by the moorings. There is some indication of occasional southward flow in the LSW layer near the MAR. If this can be considered as a hint to an interior LSW-route, it is at least of minor importance in comparison to the DWBC. It acts as an important supplier for the interior North Atlantic, distributing older and recently formed LSW modes southward along the MAR.","Water mass spreading,Subpolar North Atlantic,Mid-Atlantic Ridge,Ocean circulation,Labrador Sea Water,"
"response strategies of the main forest types to climatic anomalies across croatian biogeographic regions inferred from fapar remote sensing data","2014","Croatia is positioned in the transitional zone of South-eastern Europe and the Mediterranean, a region with frequent occurrence of severe droughts and dry spells, which makes it particularly vulnerable to the impact of climate change. It distends across three main European biogeographical regions – Continental, Alpine and Mediterranean – and therefore has a very high level of forest diversity comprised of 11 out of 14 European forest types. This makes it very convenient to study the exposure of main European forest types to extreme climatic events in the southern limits of their species distribution range. This study provides an assessment of responses of forest vegetation under episodes of climatic anomalies consisting of the most severe historical dry and warm spells in 2000 and 2003, together with the extremely rainy season in 2005 across Croatian territory. The question of interest in this study was to reveal how the existing forest types across the territorial gradient respond to highly expressed extreme climatic variations and to infer some clues about related adaptive strategies. The regional scale approach was applied which previously performed structural delineation of forest cover into eleven main forest groups or bioclimates and were examined considering functional differences. Responses of eleven bioclimatic types were analyzed by time series (1998–2005) of monthly FAPAR (The Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetic Active Radiation) coverage with a spatial resolution of 1.2km, freely available from JRC FAPAR project. To quantify and differentiate the vegetation response in the considered years we adopted indices of resilience (resistance, recovery, resilience and relative resilience). We also provided a modified approach by applying these indices on a seasonal scale to examine the relationship between variations of phenology and ecosystem responses. The results confirmed the modification of seasonality of photosynthetic activity in relation to the altitudinal and spatial gradient. At the intra-seasonal scale, we distinguished specific opportunistic behavior of the common beech and oak forest types to alternating climatic conditions. Beech forest types show a very high ability to shift their phenology to earlier spring warming as a consequence of global warming. However, continental and Mediterranean oak forest types and in particular Aleppo pine and holm oak forests showed a higher increase of FAPAR during rainy events. The revealed capability of some tree species to better exploit rainfall in very wet periodic episodes has to be further evaluated in drawing conclusions about the overall resilience of forests under future climate change scenarios.","Extreme climatic events,Forest resilience,Climate change impacts,Land surface phenology,Forest responses,Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR),"
"hourly composition of gas and particle phase pollutants at a central urban background site in milan, italy","2017","A comprehensive range of gas and particle phase pollutants were sampled at 1-hour time resolution in urban background Milan during summer 2012. Measurements include several soluble inorganic aerosols (Cl−,NO2−,NO3−,SO42−,Ca2+,K+,Mg2+,Na+,NH4+) and gases (HCl, HNO2,HNO3, NH3, NO, NO2,O3, SO2), organic, elemental and black carbon and meteorological parameters. Analysis methods used include mean diurnal pattern on weekdays and Sundays, pollution roses, bivariate polar plots and statistical models using backtrajectories. Results show how nitrous acid (HONO) was mainly formed heterogeneously at nighttime, with a dependence of its formation rate on NO2 consistent with observations during the last HONO campaign in Milan in summer 1998, although since 1998 a drop in HONO levels occurred following to the decrease of its precursors. Nitrate showed two main formation mechanisms: one occurring through N2O5 at nighttime and leading to nitrate formation onto existing particles; another occurring both daytime and nighttime following the homogeneous reaction of ammonia gas with nitric acid gas. Air masses reaching Milan influenced nitrate formation depending on their content in ammonia and the timing of arrival. Notwithstanding the low level of SO2 in Milan, its peaks were associated to point source emissions in the Po valley or shipping and power plant emissions SW of Milan, beyond the Apennines. A distinctive pattern for HCl was observed, featured by an afternoon peak and a morning minimum, and best correlated to atmospheric temperature, although it was not possible to identify any specific source. The ratio of primary-dominated organic carbon and elemental carbon on hourly PM2.5 resulted 1.7. Black carbon was highly correlated to elemental carbon and the average mass absorption coefficient resulted MAC=13.8 ± 0.2 m2 g−1. It is noteworthy how air quality for a large metropolitan area, in a confined valley and under enduring atmospheric stability, is nonetheless influenced by sources within and outside the valley.","Gas-phase pollutants,Po valley,PM,Hourly ionic composition,"
"enabling the maritime internet of things: coap and 6lowpan performance over vhf links","2018","The dissemination of digital devices across the seas and oceans of the world is becoming a reality, laying the foundations for sophisticated operations such as autonomous shipping or exposed fish-farming. This reflects the importance of maritime regions as well as the growing demand for more data and knowledge in these remote areas. Currently, the presence of information and communication technologies (ICTs) in offshore settings is limited by the lack of infrastructures, with communications being typically decoupled from the standard Internet or relying on expensive satellite solutions. This paper proposes integrating a commonly available maritime radio-technology, namely very high frequency (VHF) communications, with protocols used in the Internet of Things (IoT). By using the Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) over a low-power wireless personal area networks and the constrained application protocol (CoAP), interoperability is ensured between already existing maritime systems and the Internet. An experimental setup is evaluated under different settings and using different configurations. In addition, an analytical assessment of the solutionsâ€™ reliability is presented. The obtained results prove the feasibility of using IoT protocols over a VHF link and demonstrate that such an approach outperforms IPv4-based solutions. The conducted assessment reveals that, in constrained settings, configurations at the application layer (e.g., CoAPâ€™s block size in Block-wise transfers) strongly impact the overall performance and reliability of the system. This motivates the development of new maritime solutions based on IPv6 for ensuring a sustainable and ubiquitous development of ICTs even in the most remote locations.","Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) over a low-power wireless personal area networks (6LoWPANs),IP fragmentation,very high frequency (VHF) devices,Protocols,Personal area networks,IP networks,maritime communication,Internet of Things (IoT),Low-power electronics,Internet of Things,Computer network reliability,Wireless personal area networks,"

It influences almost all successive operations, including storage position allocation for individual container, equipment scheduling, stowage planning and container relocation, etc. This paper studies storage space pre-allocation for outbound containers of arriving ships. Considering the complexity influence of random factors and the coupling relations with other subsystems, rules are collected from the real container terminals and are described in the form of constraint. The decision-making frame with mathematics model and system simulation is proposed, in which mathematics expresses are defined for clearing up objectives, variables and influencing factors of the storage plan problem, and simulation scenarios with the random factors considered are built and run to verify the mathematics model.

"ship arrival prediction and its value on daily container terminal operation","2018","Effective prediction of ship arrivals should provide the estimated delay or advance of arrival ships with greater accuracy, and improve the performance of container terminal operations. Therefore, taking Gangji (Yining) Container Terminal (GYCT), China, as an example, this paper resorts to data mining approaches to predict ship arrivals and explore the value of such predicted ship arrivals on the container terminal operation. First, this study applies three data mining approaches, including Back-Propagation network (BP), Classification and Regression Tree (CART) and Random Forest (RF), to estimate the delay or advance of ship arrivals using the collected data of ship arrivals. Then the predictive performance of these three approaches is compared and discussed, it is concluded that RF performs better than BP and CART, and ETA month and ship length are the most important determinants of ship arrivals in GYCT terminal. Finally, series simulation experiments are conducted to assess the value of the ship arrivals predicted by RF model on the improvement on daily operation planning of berth allocation and quay crane assignment in the GYCT terminal. And the results show that incorporating the predicted ship arrivals by RF model is beneficial to improve the performance of operation planning of GYCT terminal.","Late/early arrivals,Berth allocation,Data mining,Arrival prediction,Container terminal operation,Quay crane assignment,"
"mobility pattern analysis of ship trajectories based on semantic transformation and topic model","2020","Recognition and understanding of ship mobility pattern have great significance for intelligent maritime applications, i.e. route discovery and anomaly detection. Besides a number of pattern discovery techniques currently derived from ship trajectory, topic modeling popular in the field of Natural Language Processing may provide a novel way to detect implicit patters underlying massive ship trajectories treated as documents. This paper is motivated to apply a semantic analysis method to explore potential mobility patterns from ship trajectories in inland river by combining semantic transformation and topic model. A coarse-grained semantic transformation model is firstly defined to translate each ship trajectory into a document containing a series of sequential motion words. A motion word is generally a synthetic semantic representation of three trajectory features (location, course and speed). All ship trajectories can then be examined and analyzed as a document corpus. A classic topic model (i.e. Latent Dirichlet Allocation, LDA) is employed to explore hidden ship mobility patterns from trajectory document corpus. The effectiveness of this approach is illustrated through a case study at Wuhan waterway, located at middle stream of Yangtze River in China.","Ship mobility pattern,Trajectory analysis,Topic modeling,Automatic identification system,"
"malicious ais spoofing and abnormal stealth deviations: a comprehensive statistical framework for maritime anomaly detection","2021","The automatic identification system (AIS) is an essential and economical equipment for collision avoidance and maritime surveillance. However, AIS can be subject to intentional reporting of false information, or â€œspoofingâ€. This article assumes the vessel trajectory nominally follows a piecewise mean-reverting process; thereby, it addresses the problem of establishing whether a vessel is reporting adulterated position information through AIS messages in order to hide its current planned route and a possible deviation from the nominal route. Multiple hypothesis testing suggests a framework to enlist reliable information from monitoring systems (coastal radars and space-born satellite sensors) in support of detection of anomalies, spoofing, and stealth deviations. The proposed solution involves the derivation of anomaly detection rules based on the generalized likelihood ratio test and the model-order selection methodologies.

"observation needs for climate information, prediction and application: capabilities of existing and future observing systems","2010","The demand for long-term, sustained, reliable data and derived information on climate and its changes has never been greater than today. Long-term, well-calibrated, global observations of Essential Climate Variables (ECV) such as air temperature, precipitation, and sea-surface temperature are critical for defining the evolving state of the Earth's climate. Observing systems routinely collect much of the required data covering 49 ECVs, and significant progress has been made in coverage and technological capability over the two decades since the Second World Climate Conference. However, many key regions and climatic zones remain poorly observed, and gaps are widening in some cases. Supporting infrastructures for data stewardship and analysis are largely in place but require strengthening, while those for linking with socio-economic data and for providing user-oriented information services require more substantial development. The current capabilities are summarized, and further actions are identified to ensure that climate observation activities more fully meet the needs of science and society. The Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) was established in 1992 with the goal of providing comprehensive information on the total climate system, involving a multidisciplinary range of physical, chemical and biological observations of the atmosphere, oceans and land. GCOS is a “system of systems” that builds on the climate-relevant components of existing observing systems, and relies almost entirely upon national efforts to maintain and enhance those systems. Contributing systems include the World Meteorological Organization Global Observing System (GOS) for meteorology, its Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW) for atmospheric composition, the Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS), led by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC), and the Global Terrestrial Observing System (GTOS), led by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). GCOS itself is the climate observing system within the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) developed under the auspices of the Group on Earth Observations (GEO). The established in situ networks and space-based components must be sustained and operated with ongoing attention to data quality in accordance with the GCOS Climate Monitoring Principles; enhancements must be made for some types of observations; the exchange of observations and delivery of data and information to users must be ensured; reprocessing and reanalysis must be strengthened; and national and international coordination must be improved. The consequence of not meeting these requirements would be to seriously compromise the information on, and predictions of, climate variability and change. Detailed information on GCOS and the datasets that are produced as a result of GCOS observing activities can be found at the Global Observing Systems Information Center (GOSIC) at http://gosic.org.","GEOSS,climate observations,GEO,ECV,GAW,GTOS,GOOS,essential climate variables,GCOS,"
"maritime traffic networks: from historical positioning data to unsupervised maritime traffic monitoring","2018","The large maritime traffic volume and its implications in economy, environment, safety, and security require an unsupervised system to monitor maritime traffic. In this paper, a method is proposed to automatically produce synthetic maritime traffic representations from historical self-reporting positioning data, more specifically from automatic identification system data. The method builds a two-layer network that represents the maritime traffic in the monitored area, where the external layer presents the network's basic structure and the inner layer provides precision and granularity to the representation. The method is tested in a specific scenario with high traffic density, the Baltic Sea. Experimental results reveal a decrease of over 99% storage data with a negligible precision drop. Finally, the novel method presents a light and structured representation of the maritime traffic, which sets the foundations to real-time automatic maritime traffic monitoring, anomaly detection, and situation prediction.","two-layer network,automatic identification system data,anomaly detection,traffic monitoring,synthetic maritime traffic representations,unsupervised maritime traffic monitoring,statistical analysis,real-time automatic maritime traffic monitoring,situation prediction,ships,marine engineering,maritime surveillance,AIS,Artificial intelligence,high traffic density,maritime traffic networks,Sensors,traffic engineering computing,Navigation,Surveillance,Baltic Sea,Data mining,Maritime traffic representation,Security,self-reporting positioning data,"
"results from 3 seasons of surveys in maritime canada using the leica chiroptera ii shallow water topo-bathymetric lidar sensor","2017","The coastal zone is a challenging place to map, techniques for mapping the land cover and elevation do not work under water and methods for mapping the seabed cover and elevation work well in deep water but are dangerous and expensive in shallow water. As a result, detailed information in the shallow coastal zone is lacking. This presentation will focus on the Chiroptera II, a new shallow water topo-bathymetric lidar sensor that is designed to collect seamless elevation data from land to the submerged terrain under coastal or freshwater. The sensor is equipped with a 1064 nm laser capable of a laser scanning frequency up to 500 kHz and a 515 nm green laser capable of a scanning frequency of 35 kHz. The lasers pulses are directed to the surface using a palmer scanner that results in an elliptical scan pattern with a 14 degree forward and back scan angle and a 20 degree left and right scan angle. The NIR laser is used to map details on the land and to assist in defining the water surface, which is critical in order to compensate for the 515 nm laser beam diffraction angle and the change of speed from air to water, thus accurately positioning the reflected seabed return. In addition to collecting the elevation at high resolution ~ 1m and vertical precision ~ 15 cm, the intensity of the reflected green laser also provides insights into what is on the seabed. A 60 MPIX RCD30 camera capable of capturing NIR and RGB bands of imagery is co-aligned with the lidar sensor to provide additional data that can be directly georeferenced with a ca 5 cm resolution. Full waveforms of the green laser are recorded and used to calculate discrete points representing the water surface, objects in the water column and the seabed bathymetry. Standard point attributes include the x, y, z positioning, echo information and intensity or amplitude of the reflected signal. An empirical method has been developed to compensate for the exponential energy loss of the green laser energy with water depth. This method results in a â€œdepth normalizedâ€ seabed intensity image which provides details on the seabed cover materials. Tools have been built to calculate waveform metrics of the seabed return including: total area under the curve, skewness, kurtosis, the left and right distance and angle to the peak. These waveform metrics can then be used to construct grids representing the metrics which can be used for subsequent bottom cover classification. NSCC-AGRG has conducted topo-bathy lidar surveys throughout Maritime Canada for the past 3 years using this sensor. Since the sensor relies on the penetration of 515 nm light to detect the seabed, water clarity and the reflectivity of the seabed are constraints on the depth of penetration of the lidar. Coastal waters have variable turbidity, often dominated by wind induced wave action that suspends near shore sediments causing poor survey conditions. A turbidity management system has been designed that relies on meteorological forecasts and observed wind conditions as well as shoreline orientation along the coast to predict suitable periods for bathymetric lidar surveys. The turbidity management system will be presented as well as the results of several surveys. Various applications of these data will be presented including mapping submerged aquatic vegetation, providing input to hydrodynamic model simulations to support aquaculture site selection and improve oil spill preparedness, and shoreline sensitivity mapping. In areas of repeat surveys, the sensor has demonstrated the capability of mapping subtle changes in the dynamic near shore environment.","seagrass,wavelength 1064.0 nm,aquaculture site selection,wavelength 515.0 nm,near shore sediments,turbidity management system,Surface waves,water clarity,Sea measurements,shoreline sensitivity mapping,Leica Chiroptera II shallow water topobathymetric lidar sensor,Laser radar,geophysical image processing,Surface emitting lasers,seabed cover materials,topo-bathymetric lidar,frequency 500.0 kHz,water column,NSCC-AGRG,circulation model,laser scanning frequency,remote sensing by laser beam,land cover,green laser energy,laser beam diffraction angle,coastal waters,oil spill preparedness,map details,optical radar,bathymetry,aquatic vegetation mapping,freshwater,near shore environment,bottom mapping,vegetation,NIR laser,MPIX RCD30 camera,maritime Canada,bathymetric lidar surveys,depth normalized seabed intensity image,bottom reflectance,frequency 35.0 kHz,shallow coastal zone,lasers pulses,Vegetation mapping,palmer scanner,sediments,aquaculture,Reflectivity,"

Previously, corridor analysis has been accomplished with innovative straight-line diagrams for land transportation but can be extended to evaluate disorganized corridors such as waterways. Attacks can originate from aerial, submerged, and surface origins with unique security risks associated with waterway channel geometry. A prioritization framework is required for defense operations of maritime transport, which is achieved through a multi-factor security and safety corridor analysis. The analysis classifies corridor locations into critical locations to inform operators.

"holocene temperature changes in northern fennoscandia reconstructed from chironomids using bayesian modelling","2002","The recently developed Bayesian multinomial calibration model, Bummer, was applied to the fossil chironomid assemblages of a lake situated at the present tree-line in northern Fennoscandia to reconstruct patterns in Holocene climates. The results are compared with inferences derived using non-Bayesian weighted averaging partial least-squares regression. The reconstruction exhibits both long-term trends as well as a series of shorter-term oscillations. Abrupt climatic excursions were particularly characteristic for the early Holocene period, with cooling episodes around 9200, 8600 and 8200calyr BP. The interval from ca 8000 to 5800calyr BP appeared to be warm and stable, but was followed by a pronounced climatic cooling around 5800calyr BP leading to a relatively long-lasting mid-Holocene temperature minimum between ca 5800 and 4000calyr BP. The reconstruction during the latter part of the Holocene is relatively featureless, which may partly be due to gradual shallowing of the lake by sedimentation that may have affected chironomid compositions, thereby masking the climate signal. The major climatic patterns in our reconstruction agree well with inferences from Greenland ice and marine sediments and are also in line with the previous reconstructions based on diatoms and pollen from the same core, although the finer-scale variations reflected by the three proxies do not always match. The overall results provide evidence for climatic complexity during the Holocene epoch and demonstrate that Bayesian modelling is highly suitable for reconstruction purposes.",""
"instantaneous global navigation satellite system (gnss)-based attitude determination for maritime applications","2012","Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) is a valuable technology for a large number of maritime applications. Other than providing the absolute positioning service, it aids many demanding applications, such as precise docking, formation of surface craft, autonomous vehicles, sinkage monitoring, etc. GNSS carrier-phase-based algorithms provide high-precision positioning solutions, but an integer number of cycles inherent to the observed signal have to be resolved. A newly developed GNSS carrier-phase ambiguity resolution method is tested. The new method solves for the unknown number of integer cycles by exploiting the known placement of the GNSS antennas aboard the vessel. The a priori information on the antennas baseline separation is employed as a hard constraint. A simplified (linearized) version of the method, suitable for large vessels, is also analyzed. The new method was tested against the most challenging scenario when processing GNSS data: single-frequency, single-epoch, unaided ambiguity resolution. Through different tests, the high performance of the new method is demonstrated: high fixing rate, large robustness, and short time-to-fix after initialization, cycle slips, and/or loss of locks.

"textual risk mining for maritime situational awareness","2014","In this paper, we propose an auxiliary Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) integrated system for maritime situational awareness (MSA) operations. We bring into account a new and influential asset - human intuition and perception - to the existing semi-automated decision support systems that mostly rely on numerical data collected by electronic sensors or cameras located either directly on the vessels or in the maritime command-and-control centers. For our project, we gathered weekly textual reports spanning twelve months from the United States Worldwide Threats to Shipping Reports repository that belongs to the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), We considered the maritime incident reports written by human operators as a valuable and accessible unstructured textual input source in which a span of text1 is called â€œriskâ€ if it expresses one of the following kinds of vessel incidents: fired, robbed, boarded, hijacked, attacked, chased, approached, kidnapped, boarding attempted, suspiciously approached or clashed with. Our approach benefits from probability distributions of some useful features annotated based on a list of lexicons that contain expressions denoting vessel types, risks types, risk associates, maritime geographical locations, dates and times. These distributions are captured and used to anchor the span of â€œrisksâ€ as they are described in the textual reports. After some preprocessing steps that include tokenization, named entity extraction and part-of-speech tagging, the textual risk mining system applies a variety of sequence classification algorithms, e.g., Conditional Random Fields, Conditional Markov Models and Hidden Markov Models in order to compare the risk classification performance.

"seamless and intelligent resource allocation in 6g maritime networks framework via deep reinforcement learning","2023","Sixth-generation (6G) communication networks will fulfill usersâ€™ requests for high data speeds and low latency without causing network outages throughout the world. However, marine communication in deep-sea waters is expanding as maritime traffic grows. To serve mission-critical applications, a growing number of maritime end-users require high throughput and low latency. Although deep-sea satellite connections will enable 6G networks, however due to limited service capacity owing to the long propagation delay between end-user and satellites. We propose unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as aerial backhauling and a relay medium in the marine communication network assisted by satellites and coastal base stations (BSs). The power allocation strategy of multi-satellites for a 6G network is investigated in this work. The power allocation problem is non-convex, hence deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is used to solve it instead of the conventional optimization technique. Our research aims to optimize the networkâ€™s total capacity in the case when the satellites are randomly and densely dispersed. We provide a deep neural network and a method for mapping wireless power allocation for multi-satellites.

"sea surface height measurements using a low-cost gnss buoy with multiple gnss receivers","2023","Accurate Sea surface height (SSH) measurements are important for global climate change and sea level rise monitoring. Satellite altimeters can provide global coverage observations but with coarse temporal and spatial resolution, while tide gauges offer high-precision measurements but are limited to coastal regions. The advent of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) buoys bridge the gap between the tide station and the satellite altimeter, which realize continuous and reliable absolute SSH measurements in the coastal zone. However, most of buoys are equipped with GNSS geodetic receivers and antennas, which are expensive and with high power consumption. The emergence of low-cost receivers has been applied in fields such as autonomous driving and disaster monitoring, yet low-cost receivers suffer precision limitations due to signal quality issue in the harsh marine environment. To solve the reliability issue of low-cost receivers in SSH measurements, firstly, a low-cost buoy platform with four dual-frequency receivers is designed in this contribution. GNSS antennas are installed on the four corners of a square with a side length of 1.180 m, and the total power consumption is less than 4 W. Additionally, a robust outlier detection method, the Geometric Constraint algorithm, is proposed to improve the reliability and accuracy of GNSS SSH results. The performance of our buoy was validated in Jingye Lake at Tianjin University on April 30, 2022, and another experiment was conducted in Bohai Bay, Tianjin, on August 20, 2022, to assess the performance of a self-developed MG-Buoy for SSH measurement under real oceanic conditions. The experimental results indicate that the precision of single-frequency SSH measurement is 0.91 cm using the GNSS Post Processed Kinematic (PPK) technique with a single antenna, while the dual-frequency can achieve 0.50 cm accuracy. After adopting the Geometric Constraint method, the measurement accuracy of single-frequency and dual-frequency SSH values are 0.49 cm and 0.40 cm, respectively, representing a 46.2% and 20.0% improvements compared to the root mean square (RMS) value for the single GNSS antenna.","Geometric Constraint,Sea surface height,Attitude measurements,Multiple GNSS receivers,Low-cost,Buoy,"

"adaptive shipborne base station sleeping control for dynamic broadband maritime communications","2017","Increasing marine activities taking place within the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) have made broadband maritime communications very attractive in recent years. In this paper, a coordinated satellite and terrestrial architecture (II-CST) is presented to implement real-time and broadband Internet access at sea. Further, since the mobility of shipborne base stations (S-BSs) may cause complex inter-cell interference (ICI), an S-BS sleeping control scheme is proposed to adapt the system resource allocation corresponding with the user load.

Then we use the sailing position of accessed users as a constraint to adjust the downlink power allocation of S-BSs.

"changes in maritime traffic patterns according to installation of floating lidar using spatial analysis","2023","Recently, with the development of marine space around the world, friction between maritime traffic and various marine activities is intensifying. In particular, different recommendations are being made for the buffer zone between offshore wind farms and maritime traffic, as the criteria vary significantly. In order to respond to these changes in marine space, conducted this study on the change of maritime traffic patterns before and after the installation of floating LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) in marine facilities and apply it to future changes in maritime traffic patterns. The maritime traffic data was based on Automatic Identification System (AIS) data, and it was targeted at cargo ships and tankers with regular traffic patterns. A trajectory and spatial analysis were performed based on the AIS in the marine space. As a result of analyzing the globally maritime traffic patterns targeting the location of the installation complex of LiDARs, it can be confirmed that the existing maritime traffic patterns change into three maritime traffic patterns. Furthermore, the study employed the Hausdorff-distance algorithm for clustering analysis, categorizing vessels with similar trajectories. This approach facilitated a locally analysis of the buffer zone associated with individual LiDAR, considering the length of the vessels. As a result, it was analyzed that each vessel navigated at different buffer zone depending on the size of the vessel, and it is possible for safe navigation and forecast the future maritime traffic patterns.","Traffic control,Maritime traffic,maritime traffic data,buffer zone,Marine vehicles,wind power plants,globally maritime traffic patterns,Laser radar,marine space,existing maritime traffic patterns change,ships,marine safety,marine engineering,Wind farms,marine facilities,Oceans,regular traffic patterns,pattern clustering,Artificial intelligence,offshore installations,optical radar,future maritime traffic patterns,telecommunication traffic,spatial analysis,automatic identification system (AIS),Analytical models,"

"the automatic identification system of maritime accident risk using rule-based reasoning","2012","Current maritime traffic monitoring systems are not sufficiently adapted to the identification of maritime accident risk. It is very difficult for operators responsible for monitoring traffic to identify which vessels are at risk among all the shipping traffic displayed on their screen. They are overwhelmed by huge amount of kinematic ship data to be decoded. To improve this situation, this paper proposes a system for the automatic identification of maritime accident risk. The system consists of two modules.

"making sense of heterogeneous maritime data","2022","While an abundance of real-time maritime information exists and is readily available to monitoring authorities, there are still many instances in which ships are found to be engaged in dangerous or illegal activities. In order to prevent such activities, authorities employ Vessel Traffic Services systems since they promote safety at sea while also assisting in management of ports. In this paper we report on research done in cooperation with Denbridge Marine Ltd., a global provider of maritime solutions, and present an application integrated in a Vessel Tracking Services system that allows the detection of normal vessel activity as well as dangerous or illegal situations in real-time, using information from the Automatic Identification System, a radar sensor and other information.

"a bayesian iterative geomagnetic model with universal data input: self-consistent spherical harmonic evolution for the geomagnetic field over the last 4000 years","2019","Changes of the Earth's magnetic field have been observed with varying spatial and temporal resolution since the middle ages by means of compasses, and later by refined mechanical inclination and intensity instruments, until the modern use of quantum mechanical devices and satellite observations. Ancient records, on the other hand, rely on the natural magnetization of archaeological artifacts and other materials, such as rocks and sediments, being therefore indirect, less accurate and sparser. The combination of such heterogeneous records into a single, self-consistent, global model of the geomagnetic field is very challenging: the highly uneven data coverage, both in space and time, requires a careful handling of data uncertainties and error correlations. Previous models dealt with this problem using separated treatments of instrumental data and indirect records, respectively, as well as a different handling of the dipole field component, with respect to non-dipole terms. Here we present a global geomagnetic field model based, for the first time, on the simultaneous inversion of historical, archaeomagnetic, and volcanic records, using a Bayesian approach with minimal-committing time regularization that minimizes the energy of secular variation. A detailed assessment of data uncertainty and error correlation is used to minimize artifacts generated by the appearance of an overwhelming number of incomplete, mostly declination-only records, associated with shipboard measurements in the early colonial period. Our model yields lower dipole energies, which better match modern values, as well as higher non-dipole energies and a stronger secular variation of the dipole moment. Some model artifacts associated with extremely heterogeneous distributions of records in time and space are not completely eliminable and might be caused by incorrect a-priori uncertainty assessments. Alternatively, they might represent an intrinsic limit that can be overcome only by adding new records at critical locations and times.","Geomagnetism,Field modeling,Historical records,Secular variation,Archaeomagnetism,"
"a framework for discovering maritime traffic conflict from ais network","2017","Thanks for the common use of Automatic Identification System (AIS) network has made a large number of the maritime traffic data to be available. Ships equipped with AIS automatically exchange navigational information with nearby ships and terrestrial AIS receivers to facilitate the tracking and monitoring of ships' location and movement for collision avoidance and control. Obviously, with increasing amount of maritime shipping traffic, the navigational collisions are one of the growing safety concerns in maritime traffic situation awareness. To understand the collision situations can help the maritime traffic managers to improve the safety control of maritime traffic. However, it is difficult to statistically analyze such collision due to the number of collected real cases of collisions are relatively low within a short period of time. To overcome the problem of low sample size, we discover traffic conflict from data collected by AIS network to substitute the real collision. Given a set of maritime traffic data collected from AIS network, we try to discover ships' movements that have conflict behaviors and these behaviors may bring a possible collision if they do not take any evasive action. We propose a framework of Clustering-and-Detection to automatically discover the clusters of conflict trajectory from AIS trajectory data in an unsupervised way. Based on real AIS data, the experimental results show that the proposed framework is able to effectively discover sets of trajectory with conflict situation from maritime AIS traffic data. The statistical analysis on the discovered sets of conflict trajectory is able to provide useful knowledge for maritime traffic monitoring.","maritime traffic situation awareness,maritime traffic monitoring,maritime shipping traffic,maritime traffic conflict,maritime AIS traffic data,collision situations,Safety,maritime traffic data,Automatic Identification System network,Marine vehicles,AIS network,ships,marine safety,marine engineering,real AIS data,terrestrial AIS receivers,pattern clustering,Trajectory data mining,Artificial intelligence,safety control,conflict behaviors,clustering-and-detection,AIS data,Roads,Trajectory,conflict trajectory,conflict situation,Conflict detection,Maritime traffic data,Navigation,navigation,nearby ships,collision avoidance,Data mining,navigational collisions,maritime traffic managers,Navigation collision,"
"application of track-before-detect techniques in gnss-based passive radar for maritime surveillance","2019","GNSS-based passive radar has been recently proved able to enable moving target detection in maritime surveillance applications. The main restriction lies in the low Equivalent Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRP) level of navigation satellites. Extending the integration times with proper target motion compensation has been shown to be a viable solution to improve ship detectability, but this involves computational complexity and increasing sensitivity to motion model mismatches. In this work, we consider the application of a Track-Before-Detect (TBD) method to considerably increase the integration time (and therefore the detection capability) at the same time keeping the computational complexity affordable by practical systems.

"a self-learning mean optimization filter to improve bluetooth 5.1 aoa indoor positioning accuracy for ship environments","2023","As COVID-19 is still spreading globally, the narrow ship space makes COVID-19 easier for the virus to infect ship passengers. Tracking close contacts remains an effective way to reduce the risk of virus transmission. Therefore, indoor positioning technology should be developed for ship environments. Today, almost all smart devices are equipped with Bluetooth. The Angle of Arrival (AoA) using Bluetooth 5.1 indoor positioning technology is well suited for ship environments. But the narrow ship space and steel walls make the multipath effect more pronounced in ship environments. This also means that more noises are included in the signal. In the Uniform Rectangular Array (URA) type receiving antenna array, elevation and azimuth angles are two important parameters for the AoA indoor positioning technology. Elevation and azimuth angles are unstable because of the influence of noise. In this paper, a Self-Learning Mean Optimization Filter (SLMOF) is proposed. The goal of SLMOF is to find the optimal elevation and azimuth angles as a way to improve the Bluetooth 5.1 AoA indoor positioning accuracy. The experimental results show that the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of SLMOF is 0.44 m, which improves the accuracy by 72% compared to Kalman Filter (KF). This method can be applied to find the optimal average in every dataset.","Indoor positioning,Ship environments,Angle of arrival,Bluetooth,"

"maritime border security using sensors, processing, and platforms to detect dark vessels","2018","Maritime security is critical to national prosperity, but with a large area to be secured and limited resources available, our current maritime situational awareness is not sufficient to secure our borders. This challenge is compounded by the fact that many bad actors intentionally avoid using transponders to obscure their location and actions for nefarious purposes. New solutions are required to detect these â€œdarkâ€ vessels in the expansive maritime domain and thereby enable increased maritime situational awareness and security. In this paper, we present a concept for increased maritime situational awareness, specifically designed to secure our borders against dark vessels using a novel combination of existing technologies.

"joint stochastic prediction of vessel kinematics and destination based on a maritime traffic graph","2022","Maritime traffic increases every year, and therefore also the amount of traffic data from the Automatic Identification System (AIS). Utilizing these data on traffic patterns and possible destinations for long-term vessel prediction is here an important way of gaining maritime situational awareness (MSA) for use in the decision making in autonomous ships, such as collision avoidance algorithms, which can reduce collision risk during voyage. In this article, we present a destination inference method based on piece-wise Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) processes for predicting vessel motions along common traffic lanes toward a set of destinations. The mean velocities of the processes are inferred through the creation of a maritime graph that represents the major traffic patterns in the area of consideration. After using an OU process for prediction along major sea lanes, the Equilibrium Reverting Velocity (ERV) bridging model is used to enable convergence of the prediction towards considered destinations. Then, based on the OU process and ERV bridging model for prediction, Bayesian inference is used to estimate the posterior destination distribution. Tested on a real-time AIS dataset, the method is shown to perform better than current state-of-the art methods in destination inference as it indirectly takes land and passed destinations into account.","Traffic control,mean velocities,Prediction algorithms,vessel kinematics,Bayes methods,equilibrium reverting velocity bridging model,Destination inference,traffic patterns,posterior destination distribution,Stochastic processes,Predictive models,traffic lanes,sea lanes,maritime situational awareness,long-term vessel prediction,piece-wise Ornstein-Uhlenbeck,Mechatronics,ships,marine safety,automatic identification system,marine engineering,stochastic processes,joint stochastic prediction,collision risk,maritime graph,real-time AIS dataset,maritime graphs,traffic data,Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes,vessel motions,maritime traffic graph,decision making,collision avoidance algorithms,Bayesian inference,Real-time systems,graph theory,ERV bridging model,telecommunication traffic,inference mechanisms,traffic engineering computing,Navigation,collision avoidance,OU process,AIS data,destination inference method,autonomous ships,"
"estimation of the contributions of the sources driving pm2.5 levels in a central mediterranean coastal town","2018","Receptor modelling techniques are widely used in order to identify the main natural and anthropogenic processes driving aerosol levels at a receptor. In this work, Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) was used to apportion PM2.5 levels at a traffic site (Msida) located in a coastal town. 180 filters collected throughout a yearly sampling campaign conducted in 2016, were chemically characterized by light absorbance analysis, x-ray fluorescence and ion chromatography in order to determine the concentrations of black carbon, 17 elements and 5 ions, respectively. The resulting chemical data base was used in conjunction with PMF in order to identify the 7 components affecting the PM2.5 levels at the receptor site. Six of these sources are considered to be typical of the atmospheric composition of coastal traffic sites: traffic (27.3%), ammonium sulfate (23.6%), Saharan dust (15%), aged sea salt (12.7%), shipping (5%) and fresh sea salt (4.6%). This is the first time that such a study was carried out in Malta and helps in understanding the aerosol pollution climate of the Central Mediterranean, which is still relatively understudied when compared to the Eastern and Western Mediterranean. Furthermore, we have isolated a factor exclusive to Malta: the fireworks component, which is responsible for 2.9% of the PM2.5 and which has health implications due to its chemical composition. The results of this work should also serve to guide the policy makers in achieving the necessary emission reductions in order to achieve the WHO guideline for PM2.5 by 2020.","PM,Positive matrix factorization,Natural aerosol sources,Anthropogenic aerosol sources,Source apportionment,Central mediterranean,"

"intelligent edge-enabled efficient multi-source data fusion for autonomous surface vehicles in maritime internet of things","2022","With the rapid development of low-end Internet of Things (IoT) devices and shipborne sensors, efficient multi-source data fusion methods for autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) have recently attracted significant research interest in intelligent edge-enabled maritime applications. The data fusion capacity can enhance the situation awareness of ASVs, leading to improved efficacy and safety in ASV-empowered maritime IoT (MIoT). Both cameras and automatic identification system (AIS) equipment, which provide visual and positioning information, respectively, have become the commonly adopted cost-effective sensors. In this work, we first introduce a lightweight YOLOX-s network with transfer learning to accurately and robustly detect the moving vessels at different scales in real time. A data augmentation method is then proposed to promote its generalization ability. The detected vessels and synchronous AIS messages are finally fused to make full use of the multi-source sensing data, contributing to an augmented reality (AR)-based maritime navigation system at the shipborne intelligent edges. The AR system is able to superimpose both static and dynamic information from the collected AIS messages onto the video-captured images. It has the capacity of providing auxiliary information for early warning of navigation risks for ASVs in MIoT networks.

"efficient lidar-based object segmentation and mapping for maritime environments","2019","This paper proposes a method that utilizes a 3-D occupancy grid to efficiently map a large area while retaining simple representations of objects for path planning and provide spatial characteristics of objects, which may be used for object classification. To enable large-scale mapping of objects, a region around the unmanned surface vehicle (USV) is defined where a high density of LiDAR returns is expected, termed the visibility horizon. The polygon intersection between the visibility horizon and the newly detected objects is computed, as well as the polygon subtraction of the visibility horizon from the mapped list of polygons. The two polygon lists are then combined using a polygon union operation, with the objects retaining class designations. The result is a 2-D map that contains polygon representations of objects, where the object is described with a tunable number of vertices and may have an associated object class. Thus, providing necessary information for path planning and tasking.

"contrasting glacimarine sedimentary environments of two arctic fiords on disko, west greenland","1998","Two fiords, Kangerluk and Akulliit, on the island of Disko, central West Greenland have very different sedimentary regimes caused by differences in the characteristics of their drainage basins and in the exposure of their waters to the open sea of Baffin Bay. Their insular location also results in much lower input of water and sediment than in nearby fiords on the mainland of Greenland that are affected by glaciers from the Greenland Ice Cap. Akulliit has a small drainage basin and low input of water and sediment; it is directly exposed to the higher energy wave environment of Baffin Bay. As a consequence, the mean thickness of Holocene glacimarine sediment assessed in acoustic records is less than 6 m in the inner and middle reaches of the fiord (mean Holocene accumulation, 0.4 mm/a) and about 11 m (1 mm/a) near the mouth. Dated core sediment indicates that rates are less than 0.5 mm/a in the outer fiord in the last 2 ka. The larger, more glacier-covered drainage basin of Kangerluk contributes much larger loads of sediment to a fiord environment protected from the open sea. As a result, Holocene glacimarine sediment is more than 80 m thick in the inner fiord (mean Holocene accumulation up to 5 mm/a), decreasing to 10–40 m (about 1 mm/a) in the middle reaches. Accumulation rates in Kangerluk are within the range of arctic fiords, including those of Baffin Island, but those in Akulliit are near the lower limit. The decrease in thickness distally in Kangerluk is typical of arctic fiords, but the opposite trend in Akulliit is probably due to erosion and re-distribution of sediment in the higher energy environment there.","sediment,fiord,oceanography,Greenland,"
"joint optimization of trajectory and power allocation for usv-assisted maritime wireless network","2021","Unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) have attracted significant interest recently in maritime wireless communication. This paper studies a USV-assisted maritime wireless network where the USV is employed to support the communication connection between the terrestrial base station (TBS) and ship. Considering the maritime environment characteristic and earth curvature, we establish a systematic USV kinetics and information transmission model. An expected throughput maximization problem is then formulated, where the USV trajectory and power allocation are jointly considered, subject to the constraints of kinematics, safe sailing, line-of-sight (LoS) link distances, power allocation, and information-causality. Due to the complexity of the maritime two-ray signal propagation model, we propose a channel approximation method to find the upper bound of the throughput.

"learning maritime obstacle detection from weak annotations by scaffolding","2022","Coastal water autonomous boats rely on robust perception methods for obstacle detection and timely collision avoidance. The current state-of-the-art is based on deep segmentation networks trained on large datasets. Per-pixel ground truth labeling of such datasets, however, is labor-intensive and expensive. We observe that far less information is required for practical obstacle avoidance - the location of water edge on static obstacles like shore and approximate location and bounds of dynamic obstacles in the water is sufficient to plan a reaction. We propose a new scaffolding learning regime (SLR) that allows training obstacle detection segmentation networks only from such weak annotations, thus significantly reducing the cost of ground-truth labeling. Experiments show that maritime obstacle segmentation networks trained using SLR substantially outperform the same networks trained with dense ground truth labels, despite a significant reduction in labelling effort. Thus accuracy is not sacrificed for labelling simplicity but is in fact improved, which is a remarkable result.","Image edge detection,Vision for Aerial/Drone/Underwater/Ground Vehicles Object Detection/Recognition/Categorization,Transfer,timely collision avoidance,per-pixel ground truth labeling,Grouping and Shape,Costs,SLR,coastal water autonomous boats,robust perception methods,Sea measurements,maritime obstacle segmentation networks,dynamic obstacles,practical obstacle avoidance,deep segmentation networks,scaffolding,labelling simplicity,boats,Few-shot,approximate location,Annotations,water edge,ground-truth labeling,labelling effort,weak annotations,static obstacles,Training,shore,dense ground truth labels,mobile robots,Segmentation,Vision for Robotics,Labeling,maritime obstacle detection,image segmentation,Semi- and Un- supervised Learning,collision avoidance,learning (artificial intelligence),Computer vision,training obstacle detection segmentation networks,"
"an improved nearest point based location routing protocol for maritime wireless mesh networks","2019","Maritime wireless mesh network (MWMN) has merged as a remarkable solution to provide the network service for a growing number of marine users. One of the most crucial issues in a MWMN is the appropriate routing decision, which can contribute to efficient and reliable communication. Unfortunately, previous works have paid little attention to the intermittently connected maritime environment. In this paper, we propose an Improved Nearest Point based Location Routing (INPLR) protocol for an intermittently connected MWMN, with a joint consideration of the expected delivery time and sea condition. We first estimate the movement range of the destination, then develop a carrying and forwarding metric (CFM) based on the concept of nearest point. Subsequently, the ship with the minimum value of CFM is selected as the packet carrier. Moreover, the retransmission mechanism is applied to reduce the packet loss. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our proposal by extensive simulation. Compared with the existing algorithms, our proposal exhibits a better performance in terms of packet delivery ratio and overhead.","retransmission mechanism,Improved Nearest Point based Location Routing protocol,wireless mesh networks,Wireless mesh networks,Marine vehicles,carrying and forwarding metric,routing protocols,carry and forward,Routing protocols,maritime wireless mesh network,network service,routing decision,location routing,Sea state,intermittently connected maritime environment,Routing,packet carrier,marine communication,reliable communication,intermittently connected MWMN,nearest point,intermittent connectivity,"
"radar detection of low-altitude targets in a maritime environment","1995","Results from a unique analytical and experimental effort to assess low-altitude, short-range, radar detection capabilities in an evaporation ducting environment are presented. Within the horizon, the duct may shift the location of the last interference null several kilometers in range, which may cause nondetection at ranges where detection is expected and detection at ranges where detection is not expected. In addition, the evaporation duct may reduce the signal strength at ranges near the last interference peak so that detection of low-altitude, small-size, targets may not be possible until the target is much closer. At ranges near and beyond the horizon, radar signal strength depends both on the surface layer and on the mixed layer. To accurately model propagation in this region, knowledge of both surface layer and upper air meteorology Is required. An empirical model to merge the surface layer with the mixed layer has been developed. Comparisons of measured to calculated detection range indicate that the assumption of a standard atmosphere minimizes the variance of the difference between the detection ranges whereas ranges calculated using the measured surface meteorological conditions and a modified surface layer model minimizes the median of the difference.<>","evaporation,surface layer,propagation,Ducts,radar detection,surface meteorological conditions,atmospheric boundary layer,signal strength,low-altitude targets,SHF,9415 MHz,Sea measurements,military systems,Meteorology,Atmospheric modeling,tropospheric electromagnetic wave propagation,marine systems,X-band,microwave propagation,electromagnetic wave interference,Atmosphere,Oceans,atmospheric humidity,Sea surface,radar interference,Atmospheric measurements,radiofrequency interference,evaporation ducting environment,maritime environment,mixed layer,small-size targets,short-range radar detection,horizon,Interference,last interference null,Radar detection,"

"trial results conducted by multiple canadian government agencies of the recent covert technology developped by tektrap to trace and track the integrity of maritime containers worldwide","2012","iCargo is an easy-to-install miniature covert electronic device combining GPS and door lock tracking with wireless and satellite communications to remotely track the status and position of maritime containers worldwide. A system of strategically placed readers combined with satellite or cellular communications and redundant technologies ensures that security breaches are detected early and reliably anywhere along the supply chain. iCargo provides a GPS trace of where a container has travelled and where the container might have been opened. Deviations from the expected itinerary in time and/or distance are detected and the container can be flagged for physical inspection. Such a system helps borders authorities to focus their energy on suspicious cargo with the overall impact of speeding the flow of all cargo. iCargo uses a patented technique to convert the metal structure of the container into an antenna thereby allowing it to be installed behind the rubber seal of the door in a truly covert fashion. Other technologies are visible from the exterior and vulnerable to tampering and damage during container handling. The location within the door gasket is ideal for monitoring the door open/close status as well as for acting as a communications gateway to optional internal sensors. There are approximately 7 million maritime containers entering/leaving North America every year. The interiors of such containers are rarely inspected. Such containers may include contraband, hazmats, weapons or illegal items that present an economic or security risk. Despite significant security improvements since Sept-11th, only 5% of the maritime containers go through physical inspection. The use of the iCargo mounted on a container at the point of departure will assist government authorities in making better decisions about which containers to inspect thereby speeding up the overall throughput of all containers. In today's lean economy, goods in transit do not contribute to economic growth but instead are added costs to customers and shippers. With rising fuel and transportation costs, delays at borders are becoming increasingly expensive. Early detection via the iCargo system will help to reduce these costs by not only helping to shorten inspection delays but by also allowing officials to focus their energy on suspicious cargo thereby improving border security. Tektrap has been selected for the Pool of Pre-qualified Proposals for the Canadian Innovation Commercialization Program (CICP). CICP is a very competitive program that targets recent innovations, especially in the field of national security, which are ready for the beta phase of product development. Within this award, iCargo will be evaluated during spring and early summer 2012 by Canada Border Services Agency for Canadian-US border application, by Defense Research and Development Canada, DND, for land, rail and air applications in the Canada Nordic environment, and by Transport Canada for trans-Canada land/rail and Asia-Canada sea conditions. In addition to presenting the results of these multiple trial results, this paper covers the innovative engineering aspects of using the metal enclosure of a maritime container as a VHF, cellular, satellite, GPS and Wifi antenna, thereby eliminating the need to add any external antenna and achieving the goal of being 100% covert.","Satellites,Security,trial results,Monitoring,Global Positioning System,damage,maritime containers,communications gateway,inspection,cellular communications,satellite communication,iCargo,Containers,physical inspection,door lock tracking,optional internal sensors,maritime containers worldwide,Tektrap,Maritime container intrusion sensor and Active RFID,wireless communications,containers,supply chain,GPS,government,easy-to-install miniature covert electronic device,Frequency modulation,satellite communications,door gasket,multiple Canadian government agencies,Energy harvesting,Maritime container traceability,container handling,tampering,"
"fitting empirical distributions for vessels behavioural analysis and maritime anomaly detection","2023","Naval behaviour characterization and maritime anomaly detection represents two active area of research. Although multiple probabilistic approaches have been implemented for explaining different parametric maritime phenomena, most of them are focused only on the analysis of primary kinematic data, such as position, speed, course of vessels, or lateral displacement relative to an obstacle. This article presents an analysis on multiple complex maritime activities (e.g., fishing, drifting, hidden activities) that were derived by processing AIS messages collected in the Black Sea region. Quantitative histograms were made for each type of activity while probability and cumulative distribution functions were plotted using kernel density estimation applications. After that, multiple evaluation metrics analysed the possibilities of representing these distributions in the form of known parametric distributions (e.g., Gaussian, Gamma, Rayleigh, Log-normal). Finally, there were extracted the parameters that best fitted these distributions. Also, a universal parametric distribution was searched to best fit all observed maritime activities.","statistical distributions,universal parametric distribution,kernel density estimation applications,Safety,primary kinematic data,AIS messages,vessel behavioural analysis,Sea measurements,cumulative distribution functions,parametric maritime phenomena,probabilistic approaches,quantitative histograms,marine engineering,hidden activities,AIS,vessels behaviour,Probabilistic logic,Probability distribution,probability distribution fitting,Measurement,maritime anomaly detection,Statistical analysis,empirical distributions,naval behaviour characterization,Fitting,Black Sea region,empirical data,data handling,multiple complex maritime activities,"
"maritime field trial of a dual-band silicon integrated photonics-based radar","2022","This paper reports the development, the complete characterization, and the first outdoor field trial of a coherent dual-band photonics-based radar implemented through integrated photonic circuits. The dual band radar transceiver has been implemented on a silicon-on-insulator platform, and is capable of operating up to the Ku-band. It has been packaged and engineered on a printed circuit board for its use in a complete radar system. The electronic RF front-end in S- and X-bands and the digital baseband equipment have been developed in order to guarantee performance aligned with the state of the art of conventional radars. The developed apparatus has been characterized in S- and X-band in terms of sensitivity, linearity, phase noise, and conversion efficiency, both at chip and system level. The impact and issues related to the used fabrication platform and to the packaged approach have been analyzed. The outdoor field trial has been carried out in a relevant maritime environment close to the port of Livorno (Italy). First, X-band radar acquisitions of a complex maritime scene using a rotating antenna has allowed to verify the radar behavior by comparing the detected scene with official data provided by the automatic identification system mounted on the observed ships. A false alarm probability of 2Ã—10âˆ’5 has been demonstrated, aligned with radar state of the art.

"potential impact of long-life environmental sonobuoys on littoral asw","2009","The focus of military activity has recently shifted from large area engagements to regional conflicts. Consequently, supportive Naval maritime operations have continued to evolve toward littoral warfare in complicated shallow-water, near-shore environments. This evolution requires new sensors, advanced Concept of Operations, and improved data-analysis capabilities, among others. Planning operations in these harsh-environment areas is difficult because accurate predictions of tactical sensor performance depend on detailed knowledge of the local environmental conditions. Tactical mission planning is thus seldom optimal or efficient, often resulting in coverage gaps, increased risk, and reduced mission success. According to a Navy Mission Need Statement, 'Air ASW tactical execution, especially in littoral seas, requires in-situ environmental updates for preflight mission planning. In the conduct of ASW operations, an urgent need for explicit knowledge of environmental variables is required to optimize the effectiveness of operational acoustic sensors, as well as acoustic sensors in development ' The Naval Air Systems Command has considered extended-life environmental sonobuoy concepts to better characterize the littoral environment. Most designs contain a thermistor string to measure ocean temperatures and also hydrophones to measure ambient noise. This type of complex sonobuoy would be more expensive than a traditional single-measurement AXBT but it could provide a more thorough littoral environment assessment. This paper examines the trade-off between increased sensor complexity and improved ASW performance, in terms of cumulative detection probability. Some advantages of an extended-life combined thermistor string/hydrophone approach, compared to AXBTs and tactical hydrophones, are: 1) higher accuracy of the raw data; 2) temporal averaging to smooth out fluctuations; 3) extended area coverage during drift; 4) less chance for surface temperature anomalies (e.g., mixed-layer-depth errors) caused by various electronic and mechanical variability upon impact; 5) opportunities to discover thermal and acoustic feature boundaries during drift; and 6) less need to re-seed thus allowing longer tactical mission times. These advantages are evaluated relative to the following disadvantages: 1) increased cost; 2) potential drift outside the mission area; and 3) need for increased battery life for longer durations. The analysis is tempered by considering how a potential new system might be used. One assumption is that an environmental sampling decision aid is available to determine the minimum number and best initial locations of drifting sensors to meet performance objectives. The November 2007 Requirements Document from the Naval Oceanographic Office states ?Sampling guidance: Development of guidance on the best way to deploy, spatially and temporally, observation systems in order to meet various forecasting, model assimilation, and model evaluation objectives is needed.? Work in this area is reported in this Oceans '09 Conference in a paper entitled ?Uncertainty-based Adaptive AXBT Sampling with SPOTS?, which addresses optimal sampling requirements. For this trade-off analysis, temperature data from watersampling flights in the Sea of Japan off the east coast of Korea were used to simulate expected capability of a long-term drifting thermistor string. Then optimal initial positions for three notional buoys were determined followed by a simulation of drifting positions and data collected over 12 days. Ocean nowcasts were constructed and used to determine acoustic performance of a notional tactical sonobuoy field. The analysis shows that a drifting extended-life thermistor string can provide significant improvement in environmental characterization, tactical planning, and ASW detection performance.","Acoustic measurements,Sea measurements,military systems,Predictive models,Sonar equipment,Sampling methods,Ocean temperature,Noise measurement,littoral ASW,operational acoustic sensors,Thermistors,Temperature measurement,Acoustic sensors,long-life environmental sonobuoys,"
"environmental challenges related to methane hydrate decomposition from climate change scenario and anthropic activities: state of the art, potential consequences and monitoring solutions","2023","Natural gas hydrate deposits (NGHD) have been investigated for decades and represent one of the major methane reservoirs on Earth. They are encountered in sediment of both the continental margins and the permafrost region; areas considered to host amongst the most climate-sensitive ecosystems on Earth. With worldwide temperature increases affecting continental margins and the permafrost, it is important to raise concern about the fate of the NGHD in the coming centuries. Thus, this review presents an overview of the potential consequences of hydrate decomposition on its surrounding areas. It compiles and discusses hydrate-derived methane fluxes measured or inferred from in situ data at several sites by considering both dissociation and dissolution. Depending on the magnitude and the duration of hydrate decomposition, the amounts of methane released can affect to varying degrees the seafloor and the microbial communities that sustain the methane cycle and regulate its transfer from the sediment to the water column; and that aspect is addressed in this review. Here, we also considered the transfer of methane from NGHDs and more broadly from marine emissions to the atmosphere, as it is assumed that such transfer will likely increase in the future. Finally, multi-scale monitoring in space and time is a key element to evaluate the impacts of natural and anthropic perturbations on NGHDs. We thus propose potential engineering solutions for the monitoring of NGHD, mainly based on the long-term deployment of sensor systems.","Permafrost and slope stability,Methane flux into the atmosphere,Gas emissions,Continental margins,Natural gas hydrate deposits,"
"incipient anomalous ionospheric divergence fast detection for coastal differential global navigation satellite system","2023","Differential Global Navigation Satellite System (DGNSS) plays an increasingly important role in the maritime field. Irregular ionospheric divergences may result in DGNSS performance degradation and increase risk in terms of positioning accuracy and navigation integrity. To speed up incipient ionospheric anomaly detection, this paper proposes a novel method for the DGNSS stations which employs (1) the Wasserstein distance (WD) to identify dissimilarity between GNSS pseudorange and carrier-phase measurements and (2) the least-mean-square (LMS) filter to smooth the calculated metrics. The combined WD-LMS is proposed to ensure the rapid identification of abnormal ionospheric divergences. Taking the multipath into account, which is especially severe in the low elevation angle case, elevation-angle related strategies are developed. Both semi-simulated and real experiments are conducted. For the high-elevation angle case, the WD-LMS is even potential to detect large ionospheric divergences within ten epochs. Therefore, the WD-LMS has encouraging potential to enhance maritime DGNSS navigation performance.","DGNSS,Marine navigation,Ionospheric divergences,"
"distribution and coalification patterns in canadian bituminous and anthracite coals","1989","Canadian resources of bituminous and anthracite coal occur in six of ten provinces and in the Yukon and Northwest Territories. These higher-rank coals are found in 12 of the 16 coal-bearing basins within Canada. For some of these basins, knowledge of rank and coalification patterns is limited; in others, it is extensive. Coalification patterns were examined in detail for two areas: the southern end of the Canadian Rocky Mountain coal belt which is underlain by the coal-bearing Kootenay Group and the Maritimes Basin which is underlain by several coal-bearing formations of Pennsylvanian (Late Carboniferous) age. In the southern Rockies, reflectances on coal range from 0.61 to 2.65% R0 max, which represent high-volatile B bituminous coal to semianthracite. In general, there is an increase in rank from SE to NW and from NE to SW. Superimposed on this pattern are several anomalies. At several locations, ranks change rapidly over short distances. An example is in the Mount Allan syncline, where the reflectances in the Kootenay section on the SW vertical limb range from 0.68 to 0.94% R0 max in contrast to a range of 1.30–2.49% R0 max for a comparable section on the NE upright limb. This variation occurs over a distance of about 3 km. Multiple intersections of Kootenay strata in oil wells at the south end of the area show low reflectances (0.76% Ro max) at depths of about 3800 m with no change in the shallower Kootenay repeats, whereas wells farther north show higher reflectances and increase with depth. Different burial depths, the influence of thick thrust plates, different paleogeothermal gradients and ground-water movements, all likely have played a part in generating these coalification patterns. A significant part of the coalification in the Kootenay Group appears to have been postdeformational. The rank of the coals in the various subbasins of the Maritimes Basin is nearly all bituminous. Evidence indicates that most of the coalification is postdeformational. Rank within a given coal bed generally increases with increase in depth of present-day burial and the pattern seems to be generally true for most of the coal fields studied. The average postdeformational component of total coalification has been calculated to be 72%. The most important coal field in the Maritimes Basin is the Sydney coal field. Here ranks have been shown to increase from NW to SE and from SW to NE, the latter direction following the downdip structure of the field. Coalification gradients for the Sydney field range from 0.052 to 0.088 R0 max/100 m, reflecting different paleogeothermal gradients. In New Brunswick, local rank increases to anthracite are believed to be related to igneous activities. Reflectance measurements have been used to interpret stratigraphy and structure in several fields and even to trace the origin of coaly fragments obtained from deep-sea drilling near Bermuda.",""

The tracks of each tracker must be associated and fused so that valid and reliable information about situational awareness appears in TDS. Each of the data generated by trackers has different characteristics and problems, which prompted many researchers to formulate algorithms suitable for track associations.

"a deep learning framework for enhancing maritime coastal security","2021","The concerns of coastal security are very dynamic which depends on several factors like the neighbourhood of the country, the terrain and the marine traffic. As in the present system, only the vessels which emit Automatic Identification System (AIS) data streams can be detected and identified. Small vessels like some boats do not have AIS system setup, so they can get past without getting detected. Therefore, we propose a solution by framing a deep learning architecture namely faster region based convolutional neural network (Faster R-CNN) which accurately detects vessels in satellite images and outputs the latitude and longitude coordinates which when merged with AIS data helps identify whether the vessel is registered or not. Along with this, our paper also focuses on threat level detections from the unregistered vessels to analyze any terrorizing activity that may occur along the coastline.","Satellites,Faster Region Based Convolutional Neural Network,deep learning (artificial intelligence),maritime coastal security,Faster R-CNN,threat level detections,Sea measurements,marine safety,terrorism,marine engineering,Automatic Identification System,AIS,maritime surveillance,object detection,data streams,longitude coordinates,Haversine,neural net architecture,faster region based convolutional neural network,Real-time systems,latitude coordinates,convolutional neural nets,Tracking,terrorizing activity,Euclidian,Deep learning,Surveillance,deep learning architecture,vessel,Security,AIS data,"

"secure task offloading and resource scheduling in maritime edge computing systems","2023","Mobile edge computing (MEC) scheme can enable maritime Internet of things (MIoT) to support computing-intensive and delay-sensitive maritime applications. However, due to the broadcast characteristics of wireless signals, the information in the legitimate link may be eavesdropped by eavesdroppers. This paper considers a maritime edge computing system with an eavesdropper where unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) and an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) cooperate to offload and compute tasks. The task offloading and resource scheduling problem is modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP), in which the objective is to maximize the overall performance of the system with the consideration of the physical layer security (PLS). An offloading decision is made based on the channel qualities between USVs and UAV, task queue status and task information of USVs. In order to deal with the high-dimensional curse of state and action space, we propose a computational offloading algorithm based on the twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) to learn the optimal strategy without requiring a priori knowledge of the environment.

"maritime route and vessel tracklet dataset for vessel-to-route association","2022","With an ever-increasing number of vessels at sea, the modelling, analysis and visualisation of maritime traffic are of paramount importance to support the monitoring tasks of maritime stakeholders. Sensors have been developed in this respect to track vessels and capture the maritime traffic at the global scale. The Automatic Identification System (AIS) is transmitting maritime positional and nominative information at highest frequency rate, making it a valuable source for maritime traffic modelling. From an original AIS dataset covering the area of Brest, France, we extracted a set of 17 maritime routes, connecting ports in this area. Two different representations for the routes are provided: (1) clusters of AIS contacts, and (2) route prototypes, representing the nominal trajectory of the vessels following the route. Additionally, a set of tracklets (built by five consecutive AIS contacts from the same vessel trajectory) has been extracted from the set of routes and the original dataset, and labelled either with the route name to which they belong or as off-route tracklets. This dataset provides thus some ground truth on the routes followed by vessels and is aimed at testing and validating vessel-to-route or track-to-route association algorithms.","Track-to-route association,Vessel-to-route association,Route prototypes,Maritime routes,Automatic identification system,"
"minimum winter temperature reconstruction from average earlywood vessel area of european oak (quercus robur) in n-poland","2016","Tree-ring-based temperature reconstructions form a substantial part of the international proxy data base used to examine and model global climate variations of the last Millennium. However, most tree-ring-based reconstructions are derived from study sites in the high latitudes or high altitudes, paying very little attention to low elevation sites. Thus, a large gap in the geographical coverage of climate reconstructions from temperate low elevation sites in central Europe still exists. This motivated us to concentrate our efforts on the European oak (Quercus robur) in N-Poland. We developed a new robust tree-ring width chronology (TRW), as well as four wood anatomical chronologies (e.g. average vessel area and number of vessels) from Q. robur for the period 1810 to 2010. The chronologies were examined for their climatological responses. While TRW was found to have weak correlations with climate, the earlywood vessel parameters (EVP), especially average vessel area (AVA), revealed significant positive correlations to minimum winter temperatures. Based on stable climate–growth correlations, a reconstruction of minimum winter temperatures (29th November to 20th January) back to 1810 was performed for north Poland. The reconstruction indicates a promising potential to reveal low-frequency climate information. An additional extreme year analysis suggested that in cold winters, a cold–warm–cold pattern in the minimum temperatures was responsible for the relatively small earlywood vessels. Spatial field correlations imply that our reconstruction is more related to temperature variations towards the east of Europe. The reconstructed temperature compared well with two existing temperature reconstructions, especially during most of the 20th century, even though the temperature reconstructions differ spatially and temporally. Based on these findings, the relatively extensive resource of archeological oak material from this region may be useful to perform multicentennial climate reconstructions in the temperate climate zone.","Temperature reconstruction,Poland,Temperate lowlands,Wood anatomy,Dendroclimatology,Earlywood vessel parameter,"
"resource management of maritime edge nodes for collected data feedback","2020","With the development of marine economy, more marine applications emerge leading to more deployed sensors and more generated data. However, current marine Internet only provides low transmission rate constrained by limited communication resources and bad transmission environment. How to efficiently use these resources and guarantee quality-of-service (QoS) of applications need to be addressed. This paper proposes an online optimization resource management algorithm to improve the communication resource efficiency with guaranteed QoSs for different applications. This algorithm needs neither of the resource cost function nor QoS constraint function at the resource scheduling node. Furthermore, the gradient information, which is usually needed in learning strategies, is not required either. Instead, this algorithm performs resource management of both computation and communication resources in each time slot only based on the observation of the last time slot. With slot-by-slot resource allocation, the communication cost can be minimized to be suitable for maritime scenarios. In the meantime, a long-term delay constraint can be satisfied. Results show that the proposed algorithm achieves the goal of reducing communication cost while guaranteeing the delay-constraint of different applications.

Fortunately, the nature and locations of modern day acts of piracy tend to be fairly predictable and are concentrated in certain regions of the world. Potential acts of maritime terrorism are highly unpredictable and pose a worldwide threat since terrorists may attack a country's interest abroad.

"evidence for a “little ice age” glacial advance within the antarctic peninsula – examples from glacially-overrun raised beaches","2021","Recognition of how dynamic the Antarctic ice sheets and glaciers were during the late Holocene has grown in recent years. Proxy data suggests the presence of Neoglacial advances but few moraines or glacial features from this time have been dated compared to glaciated landscapes of the Northern Hemisphere. Debate continues on whether parts of Antarctica experienced glacial advance at the same time as the “Little Ice Age” (LIA), which is well-documented in the Northern Hemisphere. We provide new evidence for late Holocene glacial fluctuations at three locations along the Antarctic Peninsula. A moraine or till sheet from a tidewater glacier cross cuts a series of dated raised beaches at Tay Head, Joinville Island along the northwestern Weddell Sea. At Spark Point, on Greenwich Island, a glacier has overrun Holocene raised beaches and a shell-bearing marine deposit is reworked into a glacial diamicton. A third site in Calmette Bay within the larger Marguerite Bay also contains a recent moraine that cuts across a series of dated raised beach ridges. The new ages constraining these glacial advances are in broad agreement with the handful of other existing ages on moraines and proxy records suggestive of cooler conditions within the Antarctic Peninsula. Combining available timing constraints into a Bayesian model yields an age of 400 to 90 cal BP (1550–1860 CE; 95%) for the LIA across the Antarctica Peninsula. Consideration of a two-phase glacial advance within our Bayesian framework does fit more of the data from across the Antarctic Peninsula and suggests advances from 575 to 330 cal BP (1375–1620 CE) and 400 to 50 cal BP (1550–1900 CE). However, more work is needed to determine if such a two-phase advance occurred. Regardless, its similar timing within the Antarctic Peninsula to that of the Northern Hemisphere supports recent assertions of a volcanic or solar forcing for the LIA. These recent readvances also provide a possible mechanism for changes in the rates of Holocene relative sea-level change recorded across the Antarctic Peninsula suggesting that the Antarctic ice sheets may have been more responsive to past climate changes than previously thought and glacial isostatic adjustment from the LIA and possibly other Holocene glacial oscillations is superimposed upon the longer relaxation from the Last Glacial Maximum.","Coast,Shallow marine,Neoglacial,Sea level,Glacial advance,Holocene,Antarctica,Climate change,"

"trial results of a new low-cost and covert technology to trace the path of maritime containers worldwide","2008","There are approximately 7 million maritime style containers within Canada, and 70 million within the USA. The interiors of such containers are rarely inspected. With market globalization, a large amount of these containers enter North America on a daily basis. Such containers may include contraband or dangerous items that present an economic or security risk. Despite significant security improvements, only 3 to 5% of the maritime containers, that arrive in or transition through North America, go through physical inspection. Current container tracking technologies based on GPS consume high DC power, are costly, require line-of-sight with satellites and they are often too large to be covert. It is possible to overcome some of these limitations by basing the tracking system on the FM broadcast signal which is an alternative man-made signal that is reasonably ubiquitous, provides a geographically unique frequency spectrum and is about 100,000 as strong as a GPS satellite signal. This allows the development of a low cost, low power and miniature FM receiver that can record frequency spectrums and compare them to known data in order to trace the path that the container has taken for less than 10$ per container. This paper presents the first results of highway trials (train and sea trials are to be conducted in 2009) of such a low cost, covert, non-GPS based technology (called 'FM Tag') that records the worldwide displacement of containers and displays the path undertaken by the container while in transit. As an added security benefit, the tag is also capable of detecting container door openings. In addition to presenting the first trial results, this paper covers the innovative engineering aspects of using the metal enclosure of a maritime container as a VHF antenna, thereby eliminating the need to add an external antenna and achieving the goal of being 100% covert.","Maritime container traceability,Costs,Inspection,low-cost covert technology,Global Positioning System,FM broadcast signal,ships,Containers,alternative man-made signal,high DC power,Maritime container intrusion sensor and Article traceability,Globalization,market globalization,maritime containers path,GPS,Satellite broadcasting,North America,Frequency,Power generation economics,Security,"

"an investigation of atmospheric mercury accumulated in the snow cover from the urbanized coastal zone of the baltic sea, poland","2014","The preliminary research on Hg snow chemistry was conducted in the industrially-impacted region of the southern Baltic Sea during winter campaigns in 2008 and 2009. Mercury content in urban snow samples was quantitatively determined through the use of an atomic absorption technique. The average total Hg concentration value in shallow snow cover from the urbanized coastal zone of the Baltic Sea was calculated to be 8.6 ng L−1. A strong relationship between the anthropogenic emission factors (contribution from local and regional coal combustion processes) and low temperature was identified for all the examined snow episodes. The highest Hg concentration in the urban snow samples was observed during the southern advection, which indicated that local/regional anthropogenic emission predominantly affected the Hg deposition. Other environmental variables (meteorological and chemical) were also investigated to establish the most important atmospheric processes and sources of Hg in the urban snow cover and to assess the changes in atmospheric Hg chemistry during the winter season.","Coal combustion,Snowfall,Air pollution,Atmospheric transport,Sources,Hg,"

The neural network provides a new means to capture complex and heterogeneous patterns in vesselsâ€™ behaviours, while the a contrario detector takes into account the fact that the learnt distribution may be location-dependent.

"advection pathways at the mt. cimone wmo-gaw station: seasonality, trends, and influence on atmospheric composition","2020","Relationships are analysed between advection pathways and atmospheric composition at the high-mountain station of Mt. Cimone (Italy), between 1998 and 2011. Back-trajectory cluster analysis identifies eight main advection pathways. A connection is demonstrated between the seasonality of airmass transport and atmospheric composition. Temporal trends and correlation of variables, flow types and teleconnection indices show, among other, decreasing trends of 210Pb (a radionuclide of crustal origin; −0.008 mBq m−3 year−1) as well as PM10 (−0.15 μg m−3 year−1), indicating that previously observed downward PM10 trends in Europe may actually be attributable to a combination of meteorological factors and decreasing anthropogenic emissions. The detection of a positive (negative) correlation of these tracers with Western (Arctic) air masses, showing significant downward (upward) trends at the study site, further confirms our findings. Lastly, relationships between teleconnection indices and atmospheric transport types/atmospheric variables are further analysed, focusing on large-scale atmospheric circulation indices and regional low-frequency atmospheric circulation pathways, the Mediterranean Oscillation and the Western Mediterranean Oscillation. The analysis reveals the important influence of such regional indices on the advection pathways.","Atmospheric radiotracers,Aerosol,Back-trajectories,Teleconnection,Trends,"
"single maritime image defogging based on illumination decomposition using texture and structure priors","2021","Removing fog components from maritime images is more challenging than removing them from land images because of the complicated scattering effects. In this paper, we propose a single maritime image defogging algorithm based on illumination decomposition. First, we decompose a foggy input image into glow and glow-free layers by formulating an optimization problem and then solving it effectively, where the optimization variables are updated by closed-form solutions. Then, the fog components in the glow-free layer are removed using a defogging algorithm. Finally, the natural illumination in the glow layer is recovered using a compensation scheme to obtain the final fog-free image. Experimental results on real test images demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of both subjective and objective evaluation criteria.","illumination decomposition,Periodic structures,fog component removal,Lighting,single image defogging,image enhancement,Maritime image defogging,natural illumination,Image color analysis,land images,glow-free layer,fog,Atmospheric modeling,Scattering,single maritime image defogging,optimisation,image texture,lighting,fog-free image,optimization,image restoration,structure prior,texture prior,compensation scheme,foggy input image decomposition,Laplace equations,"
"nowhere to hide? passive, non-cooperative maritime surveillance from a nanosat","2018","Non-cooperative tracking of shipping from space has traditionally been the preserve of state actors. Recent progress in nanosat and SDR technology raises the possibility of conducting such surveillance from low-cost space platforms. While ships may switch off beacons in order to obscure their location, they cannot proceed safely without their navigation radar systems being operational. Radar emissions may be recorded to achieve geolocation. As the radar antenna is mechanically rotated, a periodic power peak is observed by a fixed receiver. A receiver in LEO will record differing interception times according to its motion and that of the emitter platform. A least squares estimator is used to compare possible emitter locations with the collected data in order to arrive at the most probable geolocation. The highly constrained geometry of the system reduces the search to a 1-dimensional one which significantly reduces the processing power required for a fast answer. It is suggested that power reduction resulting from a new algorithm, coupled with advances in nanosat and SDR technology enables a low-cost demonstrator mission. Additionally, using only one satellite removes the requirement for high-speed data links, further reducing weight and power needs. Accuracies of better than 20km have been recorded in simulations.","Satellites,surveillance,least square estimator,marine radar,nanosat,Radar antennas,Marine vehicles,radar antennas,low-cost demonstrator mission,LEO,high-speed data links,power reduction,satellite communication,ships,maritime surveillance,Frequency measurement,emitter locations,radar antenna,noncooperative tracking,least squares approximations,SDR technology,software radio,Geology,radar emissions,low-cost space platforms,Spaceborne radar,radionavigation,"

Year-to-year variations of the averaged austral winter HIX (July–September), representative of the main upwelling season, were compared with (i) corresponding averages of the geostrophic alongshore component of the south-east trade wind (SET) between St. Helena Island in the south-west and Luanda/Angola in the north-east, (ii) the meridional distribution of surface waters colder than 13 °C to characterise intense Benguela upwelling (IBU), and (iii) the meridional position of the Angola-Benguela Frontal Zone (ABFZ) determined by means of sea surface temperature images for offshore distances between 50 and 400 km. Temporal changes of these parameters were investigated and showed that the frequency of consecutive years of strong and relaxed Benguela upwelling is characterised by a quasi-cycle of about 11–14 years.

Multiple autonomous vessels searched an area and discovered the anomaly. Upon detection, one vessel continued to search the larger area for additional spills. The second vessel began a dedicated survey of the spill area to determine the severity, approximate bounding dimensions, and spreading, if any. Upon completing its survey to a reasonable level of confidence, another vessel confirmed the boundary then surrounded the bounded spill area with an oil boom to prevent further spreading. Vessels provided detailed spill reports throughout the survey and bounding process.

"smartsos: systems for maritime advanced rescue through satellite and optimized sensor networks","2016","After a shipwreck people wear life vest and the available telecommunication systems for rescue operations offer, in the best case, just approximate localization of relicts or lifeboats. A communication system tailored to provide a reliable and real time updated map of positions and health conditions of floating people can improve efficiency of rescue operation. The aim of the SMARTSOS system is to introduce the capability for each person, equipped with GPS receiver and health sensors, to send information at low cost to a remote location, maximizing delivery probability and quality of service, ensuring also data integrity. Each life vest will be equipped with a terminal able to exchange data only with other life vest terminals; a subset of all life vests (masters) will be equipped also with very small Low Earth Orbit (LEO) or GEO satellite terminal to provide long range connectivity; the space segment and the remote service center will complete the architecture. To maximize message delivery probability and to limit power we propose a joint exploitation of linear Network Coding and a store-and-forward mechanism. Each node overhears broadcast communications of neighbors, gathers messages and code them with its own message to rebroadcast the result with an uncoded copy of its message. On the other side, the rescue team will get the position grid and health information of shipwrecked people, planning operations accordingly. The paper describes the system architecture and a project that will include the design of the Network Coding scheme and its validation via simulations and trials with prototypes.","DH-HEMTs,SMARTSOS system,approximate localization,GEO satellite terminal,optimized sensor networks,Global Positioning System,maritime advanced rescue,shipwrecked people,health sensors,LEO,remote service center,low earth orbit,LEO satellites,GPS receiver,rescue operations,store-and-forward mechanism,message delivery probability,Sensor network,Network Coding,rescue operation,linear network coding,Maritime rescue,satellite sensor networks,marine communication,communication system,High definition video,radio receivers,approximation theory,telecommunication systems,"
"a maritime targets tracking algorithm","2021","In order to solve the problem of tracking for maritime targets, this paper proposes Probability Hypothesis Density algorithm with amplitude information(APHD). Traditional radars only use position information for target tracking, however, the amplitude measurement is introduced to track the target with traditional position information measurement in this paper. First, this work assumes that the background is K-distribution, the amplitude measurement is introduced into traditional probability hypothesis density algorithm to establish the amplitude measurement likelihood function between the target and clutter. Second, the amplitude measurement likelihood function is introduced into the update stage, and the updated posterior intensity of Gaussian mixture is used for the estimation of the state of the next frame. The simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.","Amplitude information,posterior intensity,maritime targets tracking algorithm,marine radar,Radar measurements,Sea measurements,mixture models,target tracking,probability hypothesis density algorithm,Target tracking,Density measurement,Sea clutter,Gaussian processes,Radar clutter,Gaussian mixture,radar tracking,Probability Hypothesis Density Algorithm,probability,Simulation,amplitude measurement likelihood function,Estimation,position information measurement,"
"evaluation of fast-acquisition gps in stationary tests and fine-scale tracking of green turtles","2009","Fastloc GPS (FGPS) is a variant of Global Positioning System (GPS) technology that offers important new utility for investigating fine-scale movements of marine animals like green turtles that surface too briefly for effective use of standard GPS. I report here on the accuracy and efficiency of this novel technology, compare it with two alternative methods, namely boat-based ultrasonic tracking and Argos Platform Transmitter Terminals (PTTs), and provide new data on the vagility and habitat selection of green turtles in shallow coastal foraging habitat. I used a combined FGPS receiver and PTT transmitter (Sirtrack, Havelock North, New Zealand) mounted together with an ultrasonic transmitter and time-depth recorder in a tether-attached housing that allowed automatic detachment and subsequent retrieval of the equipment without the requirement to recapture turtles. With this equipment I conducted short deployments (4.5 to 16.8 d) on 3 free-living adult-size green turtles in coastal foraging habitat in Queensland, Australia. In addition, stationary tests in air and afloat were conducted at the same site. FGPS location error (mean±SD) increased as the number of satellites used in each computation decreased, from 26 m±19.2 (8 satellites) to 172 m±317.5 (4 satellites). During live tracking the frequency of FGPS locations greatly exceeded Argos PTT, such that screened data comprised about 50 times more FGPS locations despite a much tighter screening threshold for FGPS (250 m) than for Argos PTT (1000 m). FGPS locations showed the three study turtles used modest short-term activity ranges with Minimum Convex Polygon area mean±SD 662 ha±293.9. They all remained within <4.7 km of their capture–release locations and favoured shallow water, with 86% of locations at charted depths ≤3 m and the deepest location at 5.9 m. Fine-scale movements of each turtle varied from day to day with respect to tortuosity and areas traversed. Statistically significant day–night differences were evident in average rates of movement (greater by day) and in habitat selection, where diurnal locations had greater seagrass density while nocturnal locations featured deeper bathymetry. Individual turtles revisited some of their centres of activity (identified from 50% fixed kernel utilisation distributions) on multiple occasions but none of the study turtles travelled consistently between the same day–night pair of sites as has been reported elsewhere. Such disparity and the day-to-day variation in movements revealed by these short-term findings highlight the need for detailed tracking over longer periods at multiple locations. Fastloc GPS technology proved an effective new tool for this area of research.","Vagility,Activity range,Linear error,Accuracy,Acoustic tracking,Fastloc GPS,Argos PTT,"
"observation and propagation of wave groups to improve the proceedings of the maritime operation","2019","One way to increase the operability of the naval platform is to predict its future motions. To predict these future motions it is necessary to know the future environmental conditions and more especially the waves incoming to the naval platform. To know the incoming waves it is necessary to observe them upstream with an optical or electromagnetic sensor and propagate them down to the future position of the naval platform. This knowledge of the future waves can be decisive for engaging critical phase of maritime operations, like the launch and recovery of helicopters and dronesâ€¦Among the observed waves, some of them called 'dangerous waves' can induce high ship motions which carry on a cancellation of the launch or land of a helicopter. Dangerous is not about tsunami or rogue waves here, but rather relatively energetic waves (higher, steeper than average) that can transfer kinetic energy to the ship. Often these waves occur in groups. The aim of this article is to present a simple and pragmatic method based on an energetic approach to find these 'dangerous waves' out of the observed surface by the waves sensors and propagate them up to a desired position. Results of the propagation of the identified 'dangerous waves' are presented for simulated surface elevation of open ocean, obtained by using the software HOS-ocean.

"maritime moving target detection technique for passive bistatic radar with gnss transmitters","2017","The paper puts forward a moving target detection technique for passive bistatic radar systems based on GNSS signals for maritime surveillance applications. If from one hand navigation satellites are extremely attractive as opportunistic sources for passive radar due to their global coverage and the availability of multiple satellites, on the other hand they provide a restricted power budget. To strengthen the target energy sufficiently to allow its detection, observation time has to be increased up to several tens of seconds. This requires the need to develop innovative techniques able to deal with such long integration times. In this paper, a local plane-based maritime moving target detection (M-MTD) technique is proposed. Such a technique performs the integration of the received signal for a long integration time, properly taking into account the migration of the moving target during the entire dwell time. Moreover, it provides target detection in the local plane that represents the section of maritime area covered by the radar antenna. Since this plane is common to multiple transmitters, the proposed technique can be easily extended to the multistatic case, which is the bigger benefit in using GNSS sources. Simulated and experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed M-MTD technique to detect ship targets, not detectable with conventional MTD techniques, with the GNSS-based passive radar.","Satellites,marine radar,Radar antennas,radar detection,passive radar,M-MTD technique,radar antennas,marine navigation,Transmitters,received signal integration,satellite navigation,target energy,local plane-based maritime moving target detection technique,ship target detection,radar antenna,search radar,Doppler effect,restricted power budget,maritime surveillance applications,Passive radar,Object detection,spaceborne radar,passive bistatic radar system,GNSS transmitters,"
"filter-bank approach within tightly-coupled navigation system for integrity enhancement in maritime applications","2021","Navigation systems, estimating the vehicle states with high accuracy, robustness and integrity, are crucial for guidance system in autonomous applications. This publication presents a filter-bank approach designed for a tightly-coupled navigation system, aiming at improving the integrity of the navigation system and the accuracy of the estimated navigation solution under sensor failures. In particular, this navigation system is based on an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and is aided by pseudorange and deltarange-observation of satellite systems, and 3D velocity measurements from a Doppler velocity log (DVL). The designed filter-bank approach proposes a new structure, which handles the challenge of different update rates and measurement delays of the involved sensors. Under IMU failures, the estimated states from the filter bank are reversed to estimate the vehicle acceleration, which improves the IMU bias and state estimation performance at next epochs. The designed approach is validated in a real-time test campaign with an unmanned surface vehicle (USV) in the harbor of Rostock, Germany. During the real-time test, several forms of simulative faults are added to the DVL measurements to evaluate the designed approach. Meanwhile, all necessary sensor data is recorded for further evaluation in post-processing environment. The experimental results show that the designed approach is capable of identifying the simulated sensor failures. Compared with conventional tightly-coupled extended Kalman filter (EKF), the designed approach improves the average horizontal positioning accuracy and its standard deviation under simulative DVL failures by 167% and 771%, respectively.","Satellites,Kalman filters,state estimation performance,guidance system,Safety,channel bank filters,satellite systems,estimated navigation solution,Delays,marine navigation,inertial navigation,Global Positioning System,designed filter-bank approach,Filter banks,integrity enhancement,inertial measurement unit,Three-dimensional displays,state estimation,3D velocity measurements,nonlinear filters,sensors,Real-time systems,vehicle states,Robustness,tightly-coupled navigation system,filter bank,velocity measurement,simulated sensor failures,designed approach,"
"holocene interaction of maritime and continental climate in central europe: new speleothem evidence from central germany","2019","Central European climate is strongly influenced by North Atlantic (Westerlies) and Siberian High circulation patterns, which govern precipitation and temperature dynamics and induce heterogeneous climatic conditions, with distinct boundaries between climate zones. These climate boundaries are not stationary and shift geographically, depending on long-term atmospheric conditions. So far, little is known about past shifts of these climate boundaries and the local to regional environmental response prior to the instrumental era. High resolution multi-proxy data (stable oxygen and carbon isotope ratios, S/Ca and Sr/Ca) from two Holocene stalagmites from Bleßberg Cave (Thuringia) are used here to differentiate local and pan-regional environmental and climatic conditions Central Germany through the Holocene. Carbon isotope and S/Ca and Sr/Ca ratios inform us on local Holocene environmental changes in and around the cave, while δ18O (when combined with independent records) serves as proxy for (pan-)regional atmospheric conditions. The stable carbon isotope record suggests repeated changes in vegetation density (open vs. dense forest), and increasing forest cover in the late Holocene. Concurrently, decreasing S/Ca values indicate more effective sulfur retention in better developed soils, with a stabilization in the mid-Holocene. This goes in hand with changes in effective summer infiltration, reflected in the Sr/Ca profile. Highest Sr/Ca values between 4 ka and 1 ka BP indicate intensified prior calcite precipitation resulting from reduced effective moisture supply. The region of Bleßberg Cave is sensitive to shifts of the boundary between maritime (Cfb) and continental (Dfb) climate and ideally suited to reconstruct past meridional shifts of this divide. We combined the Bleßberg Cave δ18O time series with δ18O data from Bunker Cave (western Germany) and a North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) record from lake SS1220 (SW Greenland) to reconstruct the mean position of the Cfb-Dfb climate boundary. We further estimate the dynamic interplay of the North Atlantic Oscillation and the Siberian High and their influence on Central European climate. Repeated shifts of the Cfb-Dfb boundary over the last 4000 years might explain previously observed discrepancies between proxy records from Europe. Detailed correlation analyses reveal multi-centennial scale alternations of maritime and continental climate and, concurrently, waning and waxing influences of Siberian High and NAO on Central Europe.","S/Ca,Speleothem,Climate boundary,Sr/Ca,Oxygen isotopes,Palaeoclimate,Germany,Continental climate,Carbon isotopes,Holocene,Maritime climate,"
"polybrominated diphenyl ethers (pbdes) in sediments and mussel tissues from hong kong marine waters","2005","Sediments and green-lipped mussels, Perna viridis, were used to investigate concentrations of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) in Hong Kong’s marine environment. PBDEs have been used extensively over the past two decades as flame retardants in polymer additives for a variety of plastics, computers, furniture, building materials, and fabrics. Many measurements of PBDEs in various environmental matrices have been reported from Belgium, Holland, Japan, Europe and North America, but few measurements are available for the southeast Asian region and Hong Kong. PBDE congeners (n=15) were measured in 13 sediments and nine mussel samples, taken from Hong Kong marine waters. The ∑15PBDEs in sediments ranged between 1.7 and 53.6ngg−1 dry wt, with the highest concentrations located around the most heavily populated areas of Victoria Harbour and Sai Kung, while the lowest concentrations of ∑15PBDEs were found at more remote locations of Sha Tau Kok, Wong Chuk Bay, Castle Peak Bay, and Gold Coast. ∑15PBDEs ranged from 27.0 to 83.7ngg−1 dry wt of mussel tissues. Although not identical, most of the congeners in sediments were found in mussel tissues, with BDE-47, BDE-99, BDE-153 and BDE-183 being the most prominent in both matrices. On the basis of a literature survey, the concentrations of PBDEs reported in Hong Kong sediments and mussel tissues are amongst the highest in the world.","Mussels,Sediments,Hong Kong,Polybrominated diphenyl ethers,PBDEs,"

The locations covered in this paper are RÃ¸st (67.5Â°N), VadsÃ¸ (70.1Â°N) and Isfjord Radio (78.1Â°N). The elevation angles towards the satellite are 14, 10 and 3 degrees, respectively. Excess attenuation and precipitation are studied and compared with prediction models from ITU-R. The measured rain intensities at 0.01 per cent of time are 5.8 mm/h for Isfjord Radio, 13.8 mm/h for VadsÃ¸ and 16.5 mm for RÃ¸st. For the three stations, the predicted rain intensities from ITU-R, at the same time percentage, are significantly higher, while the values from the Norwegian mainland rain intensity map are relatively close to the measured ones. Rain height based on measured ground temperatures are lower than those utilised in the ITU-R model for VadsÃ¸ and Isfjord Radio. The significance of cloud attenuation is clearly visible when investigating the same two sites, which both have long paths through the atmosphere.

"a methodology to improve the assessment of vulnerability on the maritime supply chain of energy","2015","The globalization of trade is due to the transportation possibilities and the standardization (containerization of freight). The dependency of the economy to the sea and to the merchant navy has increase this last decade. This process forms a worldwide maritime network between the different locations of production and consumption.

Rodrigue demonstrates[1] the economic dependency of energy is increasing in the industrialized countries (North America, Europe, East Asia). The inter-regional trade of oil was 31 million bbl/day in 2002 and is expected to grow up to 57 bbl/day in 2030 [2]. Most of the international traffic use a maritime way, where may occur disruptions. For example, the Suez crisis (1956-1957) caused a closure of the canal, reducing the throughput capacity of transportation. This disruption cost a 2 millions of barrels lost per day.

"spatial-modulated physical-layer network coding based on block markov superposition transmission for maritime relay communications","2020","As an alternative to satellite communications, multi-hop relay networks can be deployed for maritime long-distance communications. Distinct from terrestrial environment, marine radio signals are affected by many factors, e.g., weather conditions, evaporation ducting, and ship rocking caused by waves. To ensure the data transmission reliability, the block Markov superposition transmission (BMST) codes, which are easily configurable and have predictable performance, are applied in this study. Meanwhile, the physical-layer network coding (PNC) scheme with spatial modulation (SM) is adopted to improve the spectrum utilization. For the BMST-SM-PNC system, we propose an iterative algorithm, which utilizes the channel observations and the a priori information from BMST decoder, to compute the soft information corresponding to the XORed bits constructed by the relay node. The results indicate that the proposed scheme outperforms the convolutional coded SM-PNC over fast-fading Rician channels.

"multi-agent distributed cooperative routing for maritime emergency communication","2023","With the development of intelligent shipping industry, massive terminal device is connected to maritime network, which causes the centralized scheduling mechanism fails to meet the communication requirements of large-scale network. Mean-while, constant location changes of vessels make it difficult to acquire the optimal route planning with existing routing schemes.

For large network with small-scale topological changes, we leverage online learning mechanism for local training to ensure the accuracy of routing decision.

"aerosol characteristics and types in the marine environments surrounding the east mediterranean - middle east (emme) region during the aqaba campaign","2023","This study analyzes the aerosol optical properties (scattering, absorption coefficients, single scattering albedo), supported by chemical composition measurements, in the marine boundary layer of the East Mediterranean – Middle East (EMME) region, aiming to explore the spatio-temporal variability, aerosol mixing state, sources and dominant types. The measurements were taken during the AQABA (Air Quality and climate change in the Arabian Basin) cruise campaign (1st July – September 1, 2017) from the south of France to Kuwait and back. Both scattering and absorption coefficients for PM1 and PM10 particles maximized in the southern Red Sea, due to continental outflow from East Africa, and in the Arabian/Persian Gulf due to enhanced anthropogenic/industrial emissions, leading to 3-fold sulfate concentrations compared to the other regions. The East Mediterranean exhibited moderate aerosol loading, with high scattering Ångström Exponent (SAE) values (1.98, 1.30 for PM1 and PM10, respectively), which increased in the Suez Canal and the Arabian Gulf due to impact from combustion sources. The aerosol over the Gulf of Aden and the West Arabian Sea was dominated by coarse particles (SAE<1), with higher Ca2+ concentrations (dust influence). The absorption Ångström Exponent (AAE) remained close to 1, indicative of black carbon (BC) from fossil fuel combustion, while it increased in regions dominated by dust (Gulf of Aden, Arabian Sea). Contrasting aerosol types were identified between the sub-regions using the SAE vs. AAE classification scheme. The “BC-dominated” type prevailed over the East Mediterranean and Suez Canal, while dust mixtures dominated in the Gulf of Aden and the Arabian Sea. Over the Arabian Gulf, mixing of anthropogenic pollution with marine aerosols formed a type with fine particles and low spectral dependence of absorption (AAE<1). Spectral SSA significantly varied along the ship cruise, while it was used for determination of dust influence in the marine environment.","Marine boundary layer,Mediterranean,Aerosol scattering,Absorption,Aerosol types,Middle East,"

This detection problem is handled by a generalized likelihood ratio detector whose test statistics has a simple closed form expression.

"maritime vessel route extraction and automatic information system (ais) spoofing detection","2021","Automated Identification System (AIS) comprises of a global real-time network of maritime vessels, transmitters, and satellite or ground-station receivers, which are used to track and record time-stamped static (vessel-id, type, etc.) and dynamic (location, course, speed, etc.) information of all maritime vessels. Traditionally, this data feed has been used by vessel traffic services to avoid vessel collisions, however increasingly, marine researchers and data scientists have shown interest in developing algorithms on historical AIS data-dumps with diverse objectives such as estimating trends in global ocean-currents, maritime logistical planning, fishing fleet monitoring and enhancing maritime security. This paper aims to propose a novel shipping-route extraction algorithm to process historical AIS data (running into tens of gigabytes of daily data, from more than a hundred thousand maritime vessels), to effectively characterize global shipping route behaviour and capture its seasonal trends. This is done by formulating a sigmoid based turning waypoint identification, which does not solely depend on the change in the course of a vessel, derived from AIS message. The AIS data is further processed to excerpt the vesselâ€™s distance from the nearest port and nearest shore with resolution of about 1 km, which forms a handy metric for the identification of suspicious ports. Several other use cases are also explored, which include detecting various anomalies in individual vessel behaviour such as intentional or unintentional switching off AIS transmission, shipping-lane deviations, spoofing transmission messages. To tackle spoofing anomaly, various spoofing identification methods are discussed. A region-based spoofing identification algorithm is developed to identify spoofing points under multiple categories using a clustering algorithm. All the results are visualized through an open-source map overlay. The results contribute to a growing body of fast shipping route analysis algorithms.","Pattern recognition,fleet monitoring,Clustering algorithms,size 1.0 km,Folium,AIS transmission,ground-station receivers,historical AIS data-dumps,maritime vessels,Switches,security of data,maritime security,vessel behaviour,maritime logistical planning,Transmitters,global shipping route behaviour,Turning,logistics,ships,marine safety,Route Extraction,marine engineering,nearest port,Automatic Identification system,Port catalogue,vessel traffic services,automatic information system spoofing detection,Data Mining,shipping-route extraction algorithm,vessel collisions,Artificial intelligence,AIS message,maritime vessel route extraction,time-stamped static,data scientists,spoofing identification methods,AIS spoofing detection,Market research,DBSCAN Clustering Algorithm,fast shipping route analysis algorithms,Data mining,global ocean-currents,Python,nearest shore,marine researchers,"
"distribution, sources and consequences of nutrients, persistent organic pollutants, metals and microplastics in south american estuaries","2019","Estuarine pollution imposes rapid, increasing and lasting environmental modifications. In the present review, especial attention is given to estuaries in South America (SA), where legislation, policies and actions to guarantee environmental quality remain ineffective. There, the majority of estuaries face uncontrolled occupation of its margins by urban and industrial centres, agriculture and aquaculture expansion, water extraction and flow control. The lack of basic sanitation and poor environmental management (including territories within Marine Protected Areas) often lead to hydrological alterations, high nutrient loads, and the presence and dynamics of pollutants (nutrient loads, persistent organic pollutants (POPs), metals and plastic debris) along the entire estuarine ecocline. Organic enrichment has increased dissolved oxygen consumption, with wide spatio-temporal variability along latitudes and estuarine gradients. The toxicity, biogeochemistry and availability of metals and POPs depend on the annual fluctuations of salinity, water renewal, dissolved oxygen levels, suspended particulate loads, sediment mobility, grain size and composition at the sink. Plastic debris from land sources are widespread in estuaries, where they continue to fragment into microplastics. River basins are the main contributors of plastics to estuaries, whose transportation and accumulation are subjected to interannual water flow variations. Although some systems seems to be in a better condition in relation to others around the world (e.g. Goiana and Negro estuaries), many others are among the most modified worldwide (e.g. Guanabara Bay and Estero Salado System). We propose that, estuarine conservation plans should consider year-round fluctuations of the ecocline and the resulting cycles of retention and flush of environmental signals and their influence on trophic webs over the whole extent of estuarine gradients.","estuarine conservation,microplastic,persistent pollutants,Environmental pollution,metals,estuarine processes,bioaccumulation,"
"an analysis of maritime communications between a ship at sea and a shore station by a ray-based monte carlo method","2017","In this paper, an analysis of maritime communications between a ship at sea and a shore station using a ray-based Monte Carlo method has been proposed. A sea surface is modeled by the one-side Pierson-Moskowitz spectrum. A Monte Carlo method based on a ray tracing is employed to predict the scattering from the temporally evolving rough sea surface for each time step. The maximum of double reflections is restricted in the ray tracing for a practical purpose. The total received signal is the superposition of the direct propagating field and the scattered field by the sea surface. The statistical numerical result is finally obtained by averaging the results from many realizations. Numerical results for the link performance evaluation obtained by the proposed method are illustrated. The results show that the misalignment of transmitting and receiving antennas due to the rolling ship has relatively less impact on the communication link performance than the multipath fading due to the scattering by the temporally evolving rough sea surface.","direct propagating field,Monte Carlo methods,ray tracing,receiving antennas,scattered field,electromagnetic wave propagation,Marine vehicles,Rough surfaces,Transmitting antennas,Scattering,ships,ransmitting antennas,rough sea surface,one-side Pierson-Moskowitz spectrum,Sea surface,Monte Carlo method,transmitting antennas,statistical numerical result,Receiving antennas,communication link performance,Surface roughness,marine communication,shore station,electromagnetic wave scattering,maritime communications,"
"automatic geo-registration of maritime video feeds","2008","We propose an automatic method to geo-register maritime video feeds to satellite images. The method first detects horizon during the day time and apex during the night time for similarity rectification. It then finds water pixels on both satellite images and camera views. Finally, geo-registration is obtained by searching the best orientation where the water masks are matched. The current state-art-of-state video surveillance system benefits with this method by providing situational awareness on maps with physical data including object size, location, and velocity in the world coordinates.

"energy harvesting space-air-sea integrated networks for mec-enabled maritime internet of things","2022","In recent years, various maritime applications such as unmanned surface vehicles, marine environment monitoring, target tracking, and emergency response have developed rapidly in maritime communication networks (MCNs), and these applications are often accompanied by complex computation tasks and low latency requirements. However, due to the limited resources of the vessels, it is critical to design an efficient mobile edge computing (MEC) enabled network for maritime computation. Inspired by this motivation, energy harvesting space-air-sea integrated networks (EH-SASINs) for maritime computation tasks offloading are proposed in this paper. We first make the optimal deployment of tethered aerostats (TAs) with the K-means method. In addition, we study the issue of computation task offloading for vessels, focusing on minimizing the process delay of computation task based on the proposed architecture. Finally, because of the NP-hard properties of the optimization problem, we solve it in two stages and propose an improved water-filling algorithm based on queuing theory. Simulation results show that the proposed EH-SASINs and algorithms outperform the existing scenarios and can reduce about 50% of the latency compared with local computation.","Satellites,efficient mobile edge computing,computation offloading,MEC-enabled maritime Internet,remotely operated vehicles,Delays,computation task,EH-SASINs,local computation,target tracking,Space vehicles,energy harvesting space-air-sea integrated networks,marine safety,Servers,cellular radio,complex computation tasks,optimisation,mobile computing,Low earth orbit satellites,Computer architecture,MEC,maritime applications,maritime computation tasks,unmanned surface vehicles,marine environment monitoring,marine communication,maritime communication networks,Task analysis,energy harvesting,resource allocation,MCNs,"
"first comparison of sentinel-1 and terrasar-x data in the framework of maritime targets detection: south italy case","2016","The Sentinel-1A is the first of two satellites that composes the Sentinel-1 radar mission. Both satellites operate a C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) system to give continuity to the European SAR program. SAR is a flexible sensor able to fulfil users/applications requirements in terms of resolution and coverage thanks to different operational modes and polarizations. With the in-orbit availability of very-high-resolution X-band SAR sensors, the Sentinel-1 satellites have been designed to achieve wide coverage at medium to high resolution. The interferometric wide swath (IWS) mode implemented with the terrain observation with progressive scan (TOPS) technique is the standard acquisition mode over European waters and land masses. IWS in dual-polarization (VV/VH) combination offers 250-km swath at 5 m Ã— 20 m (range Ã— azimuth) spatial resolution. These specifications are in line with the needs of the European Maritime and Security Agency (EMSA) for oil spill and ship detection applications included in the CleanSeaNet program. The main goals of this paper are: assessment of medium-to-high-resolution C-band Sentinel-1 data with very-high-resolution X-band TerraSAR-X data for maritime targets detection; synergetic use of multiplatforms satellite SAR data for target features extraction; evaluation of polarimetric target detectors for the available co-polarization and cross-polarization Sentinel-1A IWS VV/VH products. The objectives are achieved by means of real, almost coincident C-band and X-band SAR data acquired by Sentinel-1A and TerraSAR-X satellites over Gulf of Naples and Catania (South Italy). Furthermore, the obtained results are supported by recorded ground truth vessel reports via terrestrial automatic identification system (AIS) stations located in the area.","CleanSeaNet program,Satellites,multipolarization,marine radar,maritime target detection,terrain observation with progressive scan technique,radar detection,Multifrequency,terrestrial automatic identification system stations,Marine vehicles,target feature extraction,European Maritime and Security Agency,EMSA,very-high-resolution X-band SAR sensors,Synthetic aperture radar,Sentinel-1 radar mission,object detection,synthetic aperture radar,feature extraction,IWS,Europe,polarimetric target detectors,Radar tracking,radar imaging,interferometric wide swath,Radar remote sensing,targets detection,European SAR program,TOPS technique,radar resolution,Object detection,spaceborne radar,Surveillance,in-orbit availability,C-band synthetic aperture radar system,South Italy case,TerraSAR-X data,synthetic aperture radar (SAR),"

"mercury concentration and isotopic composition on different atmospheric particles (pm10 and pm2.5) in the subtropical coastal suburb of xiamen bay, southern china","2021","The concentration and isotopic composition of particulate-bound mercury (PBM) on both PM2.5 and PM10 were simultaneously measured (24 months) in a typical subtropical coastal suburb of Xiamen bay (SCXB), southern China. The results showed that most mercury was concentrated in PM2.5 and small particulates enriched heavier isotopes of mercury more than lighter ones. Negative Δ199Hg values and slightly positive Δ200Hg values were observed in both PM2.5 and PM10. PBM input sources were identified with isotopic compositions and meteorological data using the NOAA HYSPLIT model. It revealed that biomass combustion is the main source of particulate mercury in SCXB, and the two other sources are urban anthropogenic emissions and potential marine sources. Seasonal variations in isotopic composition and correlation analysis suggested that PBM in SCXB mainly originate from inland after long-distance transportation in spring and under the influence of oceanic air masses in summer. The Δ199Hg/Δ201Hg ratios in all samples (1.01 ± 0.05, 2SE) indicated that the photoreduction of Hg(II) in the aerosol was the main reaction process of PBM transformation in the atmosphere. Seasonal variations in Δ200Hg values were also found, indicating the possibility of even mass independent fractionation in tracing the mercury sources.","Inhalable particle,Fine particle,Mercury source,Photoreduction,Mercury isotopes,"
"realistic extended target model for track before detect in maritime surveillance","2015","Traditional target tracking algorithms are generally fed a set of thresholded detections under the hypothesis that no more than one detection is generated by each single target. Improvements in modern radar systems have made possible to obtain high resolution data of the targets, making them occupy more than a single resolution cell, and have made necessary to use appropriate Extended Target Tracking (ETT) techniques, since the aforementioned hypothesis is no longer valid. However, these techniques do not often take into account the physical phenomena that are involved in the radar-sea-target system. This paper explores some of the effects involved in the transmission, propagation, backscattering and processing of the radar signal in a maritime environment, that have a crucial importance in ETT. A statistical model that considers the featured effects is developed and tested in a particle filter based Track before Detect (TbD) algorithm. Accounting for physical aspects, good outcomes in both kinematic (i.e. position and velocity) and size (i.e. width and length) estimation can be pointed out using real radar data acquired by a high resolution X-band Marine radar located in the Gulf of La Spezia, Italy.","maritime surveillance environment,marine radar,radar-sea-target system,Radar antennas,radar detection,statistical model,data acquisition,Italy,Antenna radiation patterns,TbD algorithm,statistical analysis,target tracking,Target tracking,particle filtering (numerical methods),Gulf of La Spezia,radar signal backscattering,search radar,Radar tracking,radar signal propagation,Convolution,radar signal processing,high resolution X-band marine radar,radar tracking,track before detect algorithm,radar signal transmission,Clutter,radar resolution,extended target tracking technique,particle filter,data target resolution,backscatter,ETT technique,oceanographic techniques,"
"air quality improvement during covid-19 pandemic: study of land and maritime pollution","2021","COVID-19 pandemic forced many countries to adopt lockdown measures, temporarily closing factories, diminish maritime traffic and reducing the mobility of people in the cities. Analysis from the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) on board Europe's Sentinel-5P and Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS), for the first wave of COVID-19 in 2020, have shown a substantial improvement in air quality. More specifically, since lockdown until the end of April, Lisbon and Porto were at their lowest PM10 levels in 2 years, while Madrid had a significant drop with values considerably below 2018 levels but still close to 2019 values. In terms of NO2 levels, Lisbon had an historical minimum of the last 2 years during most of April 2020 and Madrid had 2-year lowest level since lockdown.

The demonstrator represents the system as used in different classes of vessels including leisure craft (small boats), larger ships, and authority vessels. Various validation scenarios are implemented to demonstrate the system functionality, for example application of ESABALT to aid in recovery operations after an oil spill, rerouting in the presence of significant sea-ice, aiding vessel navigation in case of a GNSS interference event, and situations where multiple ships are in distress.

"extreme weather and climate events in northern areas: a review","2020","The greatest impacts of climate change on ecosystems, wildlife and humans often arise from extreme events rather than changes in climatic means. Northern high latitudes, including the Arctic, experience a variety of climate-related extreme events, yet there has been little attempt to synthesize information on extreme events in this region. This review surveys work on various types of extreme events in northern high latitudes, addressing (1) the evidence for variations and changes based on analyses of recent historical data and (2) projected changes based primarily on studies utilizing global climate models. The survey of extreme weather and climate events includes temperature, precipitation, snow, freezing rain, atmospheric blocking, cyclones, and wind. The survey also includes cryospheric and biophysical impacts: sea ice rapid loss events, Greenland Ice Sheet melt, floods, drought, wildfire, coastal erosion, terrestrial ecosystems, and marine ecosystems. Temperature and sea ice rank at the high end of the spectra of evidence for change and confidence in future change, while drought, flooding and cyclones rank at the lower end. Research priorities identified on the basis of this review include greater use of high-resolution models and observing system enhancements that target extreme events. There is also a need for further work on attribution, impacts on ecosystems and humans, and thresholds or tipping points that may be triggered by extreme events in high latitudes.","Climate,Northern regions,Extremes,Weather,Storms,"

"vessel detection and classification: an integrated maritime surveillance system in the tyrrhenian sea","2010","In recent years a number of organizations, both national and international, have put significant efforts in developing knowledge-based integrated maritime surveillance (IMS) systems. The final aim is to have a clear picture of the position, classification, identification and movement of cooperative and non-cooperative targets entering and leaving the 200 nautical miles limit of the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). Each sensor (i.e. satellite-based, ground-based, shipborne or airborne) has its own task and, in such a context, high frequency (HF) surface wave (SW) radars are inexpensive tools for long range early warning applications in open waters. They allow maximizing the effectiveness in dealing with fisheries protection, drug interdiction, illegal immigration, terrorist threats, search and rescue tasks. This paper focuses on the possibility of combining automatic identification system (AIS) data with HFSWR data for vessel detection and classification purposes. Three algorithms for target detection in compound Gaussian HF sea clutter are presented and their performance evaluated. The combined use of AIS plots provided by cooperative targets can allow the operator to discriminate non-cooperative targets and possible threats. The concurrent exploitation of AIS and HFSWR data is presented and discussed by means of real data recorded during the NURC experiment in the northern Tyrrhenian Sea in May 2009.","marine radar,radar detection,automatic identification system data,radar clutter,target detection,Gaussian HF sea clutter,Marine vehicles,signal classification,HFSWR data,Tyrrhenian sea,Gaussian processes,search radar,vessel detection,cooperative target,high frequency surface wave radar,identification,radar tracking,vessel classification,knowledge-based integrated maritime surveillance system,noncooperative target,exclusive economic zone,"
"organotin compounds in seawater and mytilus galloprovincialis mussels along the croatian adriatic coast","2012","In this work, data on the level of organotin compounds (OTCs) in seawater and mussels collected along the entire Croatian Adriatic Coast are presented. The samples were collected in 2009 and 2010 at 48 locations representing different levels of maritime activities, including marinas, ports and reference sites. Butyltins (BuTs) were found in all analyzed samples, representing >97% of OTCs, and ranged from 0.46 to 27.98ngSnL−1 in seawater and from <6 to 1675ngSng−1 in mussels. The results indicate a recent input of TBT, with the highest concentrations of BuTs found in the marinas. It appears that the Adriatic coast is still polluted with TBT despite the fact that TBT-containing antifouling paints have been banned in Croatia since 2008. It is questionable how much TBT pollution decreased since 2005, when a high incidence of imposex was established in the same area.","Mussels,Seawater,Croatian Adriatic Coast,Tributyltin (TBT),Organotin compounds (OTCs),"

"safety-certified constrained control of maritime autonomous surface ships for automatic berthing","2023","The berthing of maritime autonomous surface ships (MASSs) is a challenging operation even for an experienced captain due to the required complicated maneuvering at low speeds in a constrained water space. This article addresses safety-aware automatic berthing of MASSs moving in a constrained water region with stationary and moving obstacles. A safety-critical constrained anti-disturbance control method is proposed for the automatic berthing of MASSs subject to velocity constraints, input constraints, and collision-avoidance constraints, as well as ocean disturbances. At the kinematic level, desired linear velocities and yaw rate are prescribed by incorporating a line-of-sight guidance scheme to achieve position-heading stabilization. At the kinetic level, an anti-disturbance kinetic control law is designed based on an extended state observer. Through converting the input constraints to velocity constraints on guidance signals, the safety-guidance signals are obtained by solving a quadratic programming problem subject to the state, input, and collision-avoidance constraints. It is proven that an MASS controlled by using the proposed method is input-to-state safe in the presence of ocean disturbances. Simulation results are elaborated to substantiate the efficacy of the proposed safety-certified control law for the automatic berthing of an MASS subject to physical constraints and environmental disturbances.","Kinematics,control system synthesis,required complicated maneuvering,Safety,maritime autonomous surface ships,Marine vehicles,marine navigation,constrained water space,constrained water region,safety-certified control law,Safety-certified control,ships,marine safety,anti-disturbance kinetic control law,line-of-sight guidance scheme,MASSs subject,input-to-state safety,safety-guidance signals,safety-certified constrained control,position control,challenging operation,input-to-state safe,Sea surface,input constraints,environmental disturbances,Kinetic theory,safety-critical constrained anti-disturbance control method,collision-avoidance constraints,quadratic programming,desired linear velocities,Training,observers,stationary and moving obstacles,unmanned surface vehicles,safety-aware automatic berthing,Uncertainty,mobile robots,kinetic level,velocity constraints,collision avoidance,ocean disturbances,physical constraints,automatic berthing,"

"has egnos its own place in maritime navigation?","2015","GNSS (in fact it usually means GPS) is at the moment the fundamental means of positioning for any variants of navigation. However some attributes of it can be not sufficient for every users or in some tasks, so there are many cases when this system needs support. From the mariner point of view pure GPS properties perfectly fulfils expectations of sailors at the open sea, however there are lot of cases, when accuracy of the system are not sufficient. Besides of accuracy other performance characteristics, for example availability, risk of jamming etc. are important. As the â€œmedicineâ€ for this, differential version of GPS is suggested. At the moment hundreds of DGPS reference stations exist all over the world, but simultaneously other augmentation systems provide services for example European overlay for GPS (European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service - EGNOS). But over 30 years of DGPS use at sea causes that sailors prefer it than EGNOS.At the moment as EGNOS is fully operational, it is time for evaluation of pro and cons of both services in the maritime context. As it was mentioned, at the open waters there is no doubt about GPS usability and in fact DGPS as well as EGNOS are not necessary. In real situation this is anyway impossible because of limited coverage of DGPS. It is truth that EGNOS is accessible on all the seas around Europe, however seamen do not see so far need of such high accuracy of the fixing. However on restricted waters, on approaches to harbours and on river navigation both systems seem to be indispensable, especially because their accuracy. On the other hand observation made with AIS over accuracy of ships' position on Gdanska Bay suggest that problem is not clear. In these waters two DGPS reference stations are available aside from EGNOS. Observation of AIS messages shows, that on the some leg of the route some ships' positioning data are changeover on DGPS when other one DGPS is switched on GPS, and other one does not change accuracy at all. From the other side positions fixed with DGPS at different locations but at a similar distance from Reference Station have noticeable different accuracy. The location of these places suggests the influence of the signal propagation over land on the fixes accuracy. In the paper analysis of different aspects of both systems work are presented as well as their usefulness and limitations are analysed. Finally the advantage of EGNOS over DGPS in marine navigation and field of application of both systems is discussed.","Satellites,Maritime Navigation,Global Navigation Satellite system,GNSS,European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service,Europe,AIS messages,Receivers,jamming,maritime navigation,European overlay,augmentation systems,Satellite broadcasting,DGPS reference stations,EGNOS,marine navigation,Global Positioning System,"

Thus, this paper describes a novel deep learning based maritime situation awareness approach using high-definition video. Maritime object detection is achieved in three main steps. At first, a key region based tracking algorithm allows to, dynamically and parsimoniously, extract high-quality region proposals mainly focalized around rigid (i.e.; potential object) video locations. The latter are, further, fed into a Fast-RCNN for carrying out objectness detection and box regression. Finally, a mere box post-regression operation enables to extract maritime objects. Furthermore, the found object detections are fed into a second classification RCNN, specifically, trained to recognize up to 40 vessel classes.

"aligning value creation and sme competitiveness in the export of maritime services: empirical evidence from trinidad and tobago","2023","The multifaceted composition and preponderance of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) participating in the services sector create unique challenges for specialization, productivity, and innovation, particularly in the export of maritime services. Three issues distilled from the literature are (i) servitization of SMEs, (ii) diversification during periods of uncertainty, and (iii) value creation cluster initiatives as a stimulus for enhancing SME competitiveness, in a circular economy. Aligning value creation and SME competitiveness could drive maritime services export. This paper examines whether SME service-providers could improve competitiveness through value creation and cluster initiatives in the export of maritime services in Trinidad and Tobago (T&T). A survey was conducted in the Leisure Marine Services Cluster. Acquired data on five value creation determinants (namely, repair accuracy, concurrent engineering, quality standard, quality assurance, and quality control) were analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS). Empirical evidence shows that repair accuracy and quality standard had positive estimates, with reliability coefficients above 0.70. The application of cluster initiatives would support the development of a value creation program and enhance SMEâ€™s competitiveness in T&T.","Maintenance engineering,Quality control,Boats,Uncertainty,Sociology,Surveys,Technological innovation,"

"the paleoposition of india","1986","In most of the plate tectonic models of paleocontinental assembly, the supercontinent Pangea has been disassociated into independent Laurasia and Gondwana, separated by a vast oceanic Tethys. The position of India remains problematical, but geological and geophysical data support a Pangea reconstruction. Traditionally India has always been regarded as a part of Gondwana as it shares two unique geologic features with other southern continents. These are the Upper Paleozoic glacial strata and the Glossopteris flora. However, neither line of evidence definitely proves continuity of land; together they indicate zonation of cold climates. The recent discovery of Upper Paleozoic glacial strata in the U.S.S.R., southern Tibet, Saudi Arabia, Oman, China, Malaya, Thailand, and Burma demonstrates that the Permo-Carboniferous glaciation was far more extensive beyond the Gondwana limit than is usually thought. Similarly the Glossopteris flora has been found farther north of the Indian Peninsula, in the Himalaya, Kashmir and Tibet. Moreover the floral similarities are explained easily by wind and insect dispersal. On the other hand, the distribution of large terrestrial tetrapods is strongly influenced by the distribution of continents. To terrestrial tetrapods, sea constitutes a barrier. In consequence, they are more reliable indicators of past land connections than are plants, invertebrates and fishes. The postulated separation of India from Antarctica, its northward journey, and its subsequent union with Asia, as suggested by the plate tectonic models, require that during some part of the Mesozoic or Early Tertiary India must have been an island continent. The lack of endemism in the Indian terrestrial tetrapods during this period is clearly inconsistent with the island continent hypothesis. On the contrary, Indian Mesozoic and Tertiary vertebrates show closest similarities to those of Laurasia, indicating that India was never far from Asia. The correlation of faunal similarity is extremly poor between India-Antarctica and India-Australia. This suggests that India cannot be placed alongside Antarctica or Australia in a pre-drift assembly. Moreover, the distribution of marine rocks indicates that India faced an open sea at its eastern margin during Proterozoic, Upper Paleozoic and Mesozoic. Before the drift, India probably occupied the position between Somalia and Asia, and the Tethys was narrow and intracontinental. With the spreading of the Carlsberg Ridge in the Upper Cretaceous, the Indian block rotated counter-clockwise in relation to Africa to converge to Asia, with the opening up of the Arabian Sea. The rotational movement of India is supported by hot spot trajectory and reversal of paleoslopes of the ancient Gondwana rivers. There is a possible genetic relation between the Arabian sphenochasm and the origin of the Himalaya. With continued convergence of India to Asia, limited subduction occured at the Indus Suture along the axis of the Tethys; the further compression led to the closure of the Tethys followed by foldings, faultings and large-scale intracratonic subductions to form the Himalaya. The Himalayan uplift probably began in the Miocene, but went more actively in the Quaternary.",""
"a stochastic ray-tracing approach for maritime line-of-sight channel modeling","2019","In this paper, we propose a modeling approach for maritime wireless channels based on a stochastic ray-tracing approach. Taking into consideration the line-of-sight (LOS) path, the specular reflection path, and the diffuse reflection paths from the sea surface, the maritime wireless fading channel is modeled by combining all the propagation paths arrived at the receiver point. In contrast to the conventional ray-tracing approaches where the propagation environments (and hence, the rays) are considered to be fixed, our stochastic ray-tracing approach assumes varying propagation environment caused by practical factors such as the sea wave. In this case, the locations of the reflection and receiver points randomly vary following a stochastic process. Based on the proposed channel model, we further investigate the deep fading effect in maritime wireless propagations caused by destructive combination of sparse rays. We show by simulations that the role of sea wave has two sides. Specifically, the sea wave is beneficial to compensate the deep fading in the areas where the LOS path and the specular reflection path have been destructively combined, while on the other hand it might induce more outage in the areas where deep fading has not occurred.","ray tracing,receiver points,ray-tracing,sparse rays,maritime wireless channel,Rough surfaces,Stochastic processes,channel model,maritime wireless channels,propagation paths,maritime line-of-sight channel,outage,line-of-sight path,stochastic processes,radiowave propagation,Reflection,diffuse reflection paths,specular reflection path,Sea surface,line-of-sight,Fading channels,LOS path,fading channel,sea wave,Surface roughness,marine communication,Channel model,propagation environment,conventional ray-tracing approaches,stochastic ray-tracing approach,Ray tracing,fading channels,"
"a big data approach for fuel oil consumption estimation in the maritime industry","2022","Route optimization has been a research topic for many years in the maritime industry and it constitutes one of the key components to improving energy efficiency and sustainability in ship operations. This paper deals with the challenge of estimating Fuel Oil Consumption (FOC) in the context of Weather Routing (WR). Given a plethora of features collected from the vesselâ€™s Automatic Identification System (AIS) or on-board sensor installations, we examine how a predictive FOC scheme can be coupled with WR optimization algorithms in order to reduce the vesselâ€™s FOC, emissions, and the overall cost of a voyage. In order to handle the amount of data required for FOC prediction, we employ a streaming pipeline that harvests data in real-time from different sources and processes them appropriately for visualization, causal analysis, and forecasting purposes. In this direction, we first conduct an exploratory analysis to examine and unveil the importance and inter-association between the various variables related to sea-keeping and weather features, in order to utilize them effectively in the context of a FOC predictive scheme. Furthermore, we introduce a novel recurrent neural network architecture that approximates ideally the underlying function describing the features and the vesselâ€™s FOC by taking into account historical data, and we showcase the results. Finally, we demonstrate how the FOC prediction model can be coupled with a WR algorithm to propose the optimal route for a vessel in terms of FOC efficiency.","big data collection,recurrent neural nets,sustainability,recurrent neural network architecture,sea-keeping weather features,Prediction algorithms,fuel oil consumption,WR optimization,Recurrent neural networks,Industries,recurrent neural networks,causal analysis,ship operations,information processing,weather routing,exploratory analysis,vessel data,fuel oil consumption estimation,Oils,ships,automatic identification system,energy efficiency,AIS,optimal route,optimisation,sea-keeping,fuel economy,Big Data,petroleum,on-board sensor installations,Routing,energy consumption,shipbuilding industry,energy conservation,route optimization,maritime industry,weather routing optimization,vessel,production engineering computing,Fuels,FOC prediction,"
"maritime targets velocity estimation in space-based passive multistatic radar using long integration times","2021","Target detection by means of space-based passive radar sensors generally requires the adoption of long integration time strategies to reinforce sufficiently the signal strength. These are usually based on the recovery of the target Doppler-rate to cope with the range and Doppler migration experienced over the long dwell considered. In this work, we put forward a Taylor-series approach that capitalizes on the set of bistatic Doppler-rates estimated in Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS)-based multistatic radar configurations to estimate the velocity of ship targets with increased accuracy with respect to conventional Doppler-based procedures. Both the cases of single-element and array receiver configurations have been considered. Theoretical and numerical results under different use cases show as leveraging on the long integration times adopted at the detection stage could significantly increase the accuracy of the estimated ship velocity components. Few experimental results are also provided, verifying the potentialities of the proposed approach in operative scenarios of practical interest for this technology. The proposed approach is not limited at the GNSS case, but it could be potentially applied to any multistatic passive radar system.","Satellites,estimated ship velocity components,Taylor-series approach,space-based passive radar sensors,Radar antennas,target detection,passive radar,Marine vehicles,signal strength,ship velocity estimation,detection stage,long integration time strategies,maritime targets velocity estimation,multistatic passive radar system,satellite navigation,single-element,GNSS-based radar,maritime surveillance,Global Navigation Satellite Systems-based multistatic radar configurations,object detection,ship targets,array receiver configurations,long integration times,space-based passive multistatic radar,target Doppler-rate,bistatic Doppler-rates,GNSS case,radar receivers,Radar,radar tracking,multistatic radar,Doppler radar,Passive radar,conventional Doppler-based procedures,Spaceborne radar,Estimation,Doppler migration,"
"operation planning of standalone maritime power systems using particle swarm optimization","2019","This paper presents the power management system (PMS) that relies on optimal power planning and maximum energy efficiency in dynamic positioning (DP) drilling vessel. Nowadays, it is becoming an improving demand for higher precision and decreases ship motion induced by environmental disturbance such as wind, waves, and sea current, which leads to the use of power generation more efficient. According to this, an efficient strategy solution and schedule have increased significantly for power management of diesel generator (DG) units on marine vessels as an independent microgrid to the utility grid. Thus, the power management system (PMS) of vessels is proposed to monitor and prevent the blackout by using the model predictive controller (MPC) based on optimal control method in order to estimate the future power demand in the hostile environment. Due to nonlinear characteristics of diesel generators, such as power ramp rate limits and non-smooth cost functions, a particle swarm optimization (PSO) is applied to solve the economic dispatch (ED) problem for a dynamic system. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method can improve ED operation problems more efficiently while meeting DGs constraints.","ED operation problems,nonsmooth cost functions,economic dispatch,diesel generator units,maximum energy efficiency,diesel-electric generators,economic dispatch problem,optimal control,dynamic positioning drilling vessel,Power management system,optimal power planning,environmental disturbance,model predictive controller,power grids,power generation control,ship motion,dynamic system,standalone maritime power systems operation planning,power system management,particle swarm optimisation,predictive control,power generation economics,optimal control method,ships,utility grid,marine vessels,the dynamic positioning system,microgrid,particle swarm optimization,power generation dispatch,future power demand,MPC,marine power systems,PMS,DGs constraints,power ramp rate limits,power generation planning,energy conservation,PSO,power generation,distributed power generation,"
"a multi-proxy reconstruction of tropical cyclone variability during the past 800 years from robinson lake, nova scotia, canada","2018","This study presents a multi-proxy reconstruction of tropical cyclone (TC) activity for the past 800 years from Robinson Lake, located on the north Atlantic seaboard of Nova Scotia, Canada. Two sediment cores were extracted from Robinson Lake and were dated by 210Pb and 14C methods, and analyzed for organic matter content, sediment grain size, and a range of elements and elemental ratios determined by XRF core scanning. A distinct sand layer in the most recent sediments is attributed to Hurricane Juan, which struck the coast of Nova Scotia on September 29, 2003. Our study shows that peaks in grain size farther down-core are generally correlated with abrupt increases in Br and Br/Ti. XRF-derived Br measurements are an indicator of marine organic carbon (MOC), and the increases in Br likely reflect incursions of marine water and nutrients into the lake as a result of storm surges. The results show that the period from ~1475 to 1670 CE contains at least 3–4 storm beds, and are interpreted as the most active TC period within the last ~800 years for this region. Our results are consistent with recent research from Salt Pond, Massachusetts (Donnelly et al. 2015), which provides evidence for heightened TC activity during the same period as our study at Robinson Lake. Our study represents one of the highest latitude paleotempestological studies from the North Atlantic basin which will help the testing of hypotheses concerning long-term changes in North Atlantic TC activity under future climate change scenarios.","X-ray fluorescence,Grain size analysis,North Atlantic,Tropical cyclones,Paleotempestology,"
"microplastic intrusion into the zooplankton, the base of the marine food chain: evidence from the arabian sea, indian ocean","2023","Microplastics (MPs) are ubiquitous in the marine environment, yet information regarding their occurrence in the food web is limited. We investigated the concentration and composition of MPs in water and diverse zooplankton groups from the Arabian Sea basin. Forty-one zooplankton tows were collected with a bongo net (330 μm mesh) from the Arabian Sea in January 2019. MPs in the surface water varied between 0 and 0.055 particles/m3, with a relatively higher concentration (0.013 ± 0.002 particles/m3) in the central Arabian Sea. Though fibrous MPs were most abundant in the seawater (77.14 %), zooplankton prefers small fragments (55.3 %). The size of MPs was distinctly smaller (277.1 ± 46.74 μm) in zooplankton than that in seawater (864.32 ± 73.72 μm), and MPs bioaccumulation was observed in almost all the zooplankton functional groups. Polymer composition revealed polyamide, polyethylene, polypropylene, and PVC were abundant in water and zooplankton, suggesting that the textile, fishing, shipping, and packaging industries are significant sources. The prevailing northeasterly winds, strong West India Coastal Current, and conducive westward radiated Rossby wave during January 2019 have carried the microplastic contaminated water mass away from the coast, posing a threat to the open ocean ecosystems. These results demand further attention to investigate the state of plastic pollution in the Arabian Sea basin.","Bioavailability,Ingestion,Food web,Arabian Sea,Zooplankton,Microplastics,"
"from research project objectives to milestones by means of requirements traceability realization of an autonomous maritime system","2013","Current research projects are developing technologies that require more and more the integration of different system capabilities placed at geographically-dispersed locations. The challenge when integrating system capabilities is to choose the right system components to be integrated in order to fulfill the deadline given by the project milestones.

The approach proposed turns project objectives and its context into user requirements as well as evaluation cases into project milestones. The integration process consists of integrating functional capabilities from the system modules which are the foundation to support operational capabilities.

"measurement campaign and mathematical model construction for the ship zodiak magnetic signature reproduction","2021","The paper presents the partial work done within the framework of the EDA Siramis II project focused on magnetic signature reproduction of ships. Reproduction is understood here as the ability to determine the magnetic anomaly of the local Earth magnetic field in any direction and at any measurement depth due to the presence of the analysed object. The B-91 type hydrographic ship Zodiak was selected as the real case study. The work was divided into two main stages: the development of a measurement campaign taking into account physical measurements, and the development of a mathematical model on the basis of the measured values. The measurement campaign included: preparation of the measuring range, selection of equipment for the measurement of magnetic quantities and geographical location, and data recording while the ship passes the measuring point according to the designated course. As a result of the measurement campaign, magnetic flux density components were collected in different positions in relation to the measuring instruments and the ship's heading. A multi-dipole model was used to build the mathematical model in accordance with the idea of inverse modelling. The effectiveness of this model was previously checked on synthetic data of virtual ships generated using the finite element method. Experiments performed with simulation models were helpful in determining the structure of the model, the nature of the data, and the number of samples needed to properly determine the multi-dipole model parameters. The parameters were determined using the nonlinear least squares method according to the idea of data fitting. The classical Ridge and Lasso regularization methods were applied to prevent the developed multi-dipole model from overfitting. Other regularization methods based on GPS accuracy marks and modification of fitness functions were also considered. The verification was done using real data: the data generated by the model was compared with patterns recorded during the Zodiak measurement campaign. High degree of conformity of the shape of characteristics was obtained. Moreover, the correctness of model execution was confirmed by low values of quantitative indices such as RMSE and MAE representing modelling errors. The methodology presented in the paper is quite universal and can be used to determine the signatures of other ferromagnetic objects.","Sea measurements,Magnetic anomaly detection,Magnetic variables measurement,Magnetic signatures,Model checking,Electromagnetic modelling,Marine vehicles,Magnetic fields,"
"anomalous behavior detection of marine vessels based on hidden markov model","2018","In recent years, marine traffic has increased dramatically. Therefore, some vessels may show abnormal behaviors which may indicate different dangers or threats, and also decreases the marine security. These abnormal behaviors are called anomalies. Automatic detection of anomalies is one of the current issues in the maritime domain. Similar works have been proposed that often used parameters speed and location to detect anomalies, and also high false alarm rate is one of the main problems of those. In this paper, a novel approach to maritime vessels anomalous behavior detection based on Hidden Markov Model with the use of parameters speed, location and course have been proposed to increase the situational awareness.

The proposed methodology adopts a decentralised approach towards the allocation of perception and control processes to different agents (unmanned vessels, fog or cloud services) based on an estimation of the communication parameters (bandwidth, latency, cost), the agent capabilities in terms of processing hardware (not only focusing on the CPU, but also taking into consideration the GPU, disk & memory speed and size) and the requirements in terms of timely delivery of quality output data.

"hybrid satellite-uav-terrestrial networks for 6g ubiquitous coverage: a maritime communications perspective","2021","In the coming smart ocean era, reliable and efficient communications are crucial for promoting a variety of maritime activities. Current maritime communication networks (MCNs) mainly rely on marine satellites and on-shore base stations (BSs). The former generally provides limited transmission rate, while the latter lacks wide-area coverage capability. Due to these facts, the state-of-the-art MCN falls far behind terrestrial fifth-generation (5G) networks. To fill up the gap in the coming sixth-generation (6G) era, we explore the benefit of deployable BSs for maritime coverage enhancement. Both unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and mobile vessels are used to configure deployable BSs. This leads to a hierarchical satellite-UAV-terrestrial network on the ocean. We address the joint link scheduling and rate adaptation problem for this hybrid network, to minimize the total energy consumption with quality of service (QoS) guarantees. Different from previous studies, we use only the large-scale channel state information (CSI), which is location-dependent and thus can be predicted through the position information of each UAV/vessel based on its specific trajectory/shipping lane. The problem is shown to be an NP-hard mixed integer nonlinear programming problem with a group of hidden non-linear equality constraints. We solve it suboptimally by using Min-Max transformation and iterative problem relaxation, leading to a process-oriented joint link scheduling and rate adaptation scheme. As observed by simulations, the scheme can provide agile on-demand coverage for all users with much reduced system overhead and a polynomial computation complexity. Moreover, it can achieve a prominent performance close to the optimal solution.","Satellites,unmanned aerial vehicles,fifth-generation networks,maritime communications perspective,NP-hard mixed integer nonlinear programming problem,polynomial computation complexity,nonlinear equality constraints,on-shore base stations,quality of service,optimal control,wide-area coverage capability,current maritime communication networks,maritime coverage enhancement,integer programming,Resource management,MCN,link scheduling,iterative problem relaxation,scheduling,agile on-demand coverage,trajectory-shipping lane,Channel state information (CSI),reliable communications,process-oriented joint link scheduling,large-scale channel state information,Quality of service,Maritime communications,marine satellites,rate adaptation,sixth-generation era,efficient communications,hybrid satellite-UAV-terrestrial networks,rate adaptation problem,6G mobile communication,radio networks,software prototyping,wireless channels,smart ocean era,iterative methods,autonomous aerial vehicles,deployable BSs,6G ubiquitous coverage,Optimization,nonlinear programming,min-max transformation,Unmanned aerial vehicles,Trajectory,energy consumption,trajectory control,computational complexity,marine communication,optimal solution,mobile vessels,transmission rate,maritime communications,unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV),hybrid network,"
"insights from archaeological analysis and interpretation of marine data sets to inform marine cultural heritage management and planning of wave and tidal energy development for orkney waters and the pentland firth, ne scotland","2014","The Orkney archipelago has a rich heritage that includes the Heart of Neolithic Orkney World Heritage Site, Viking settlements, harbours supplying Hudson's Bay Company ships, and the wartime naval base of Scapa Flow. This rich history has left its mark on the seabed but accurate maps showing the location and character of surviving seabed archaeology do not exist to the same extent as for archaeology on land. ORCA Marine was commissioned by Historic Scotland to work with the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland in interrogating marine data sets to enhance historic environment records of Orkney Waters and the Pentland Firth. These waters were prioritised for their history of maritime activity and to help guide planning and developments in an area highlighted by the Scottish Government for marine renewable energy. A variety of recent and legacy datasets, including wreck databases; sonar data gathered by public sector bodies; aerial photography; seabed cores; Admiralty charts; and local knowledge, were examined for their effectiveness in discovering and interpreting marine cultural heritage cost-effectively. A methodology was developed that enabled marine cultural heritage information to be quickly assimilated within the national and regional inventories for dissemination online. Polygonisation of records resulted in GIS-based shapefiles identifying site extents, and areas of archaeological potential in relation to wrecks, submerged prehistoric landscapes, anchorages and fishing areas. Substantial gaps in data coverage were identified and areas of the seabed have been surveyed at resolutions that are sufficient to detect large upstanding remains such as iron shipwrecks but insufficient to identify smaller archaeological features. Other geophysical datasets have been created at a resolution detailed enough to allow the recognition of smaller anomalies but in some cases processing of the data has removed small anomalies of interest to archaeologists. Intensively used marine areas often contain the most artefactual remains such as historic ports being developed to service the marine renewable industry. Zones of high wave and tidal energy favoured for renewable energy devices include navigation channels and hazards where a large number of wrecks are documented. Transmission cable routes cross deep water where 20th-century wartime losses occurred. Planning and development of infrastructure relating to renewables may also interact with significant built heritage and archaeology on the foreshore and coast edge.",""

"identifying the occurrence of lightning and transient luminous events by nadir spectrophotometric observation","2016","We propose a new technique to identify the occurrence of lightning and transient luminous events (TLEs) using multicolor photometric data obtained by space borne nadir measurements. We estimate the spectral characteristics of lightning and TLEs by converting the optical data obtained by the ISUAL limb experiment to the GLIMS nadir geometry. We find that the estimated spectral shapes of TLE-accompanied lightning are clearly different from those of pure lightning. The obtained results show that (1) the intensity of FUV signals and (2) the ratio of 337/red (609–753nm) spectral irradiance are useful to identify the occurrence of TLEs. The occurrence probabilities of TLEs are 10%, 40%, 80%, in the case of lightning events having the 337/red spectral irradiance ratio of 0.95, 2.95, 14.79, respectively. By using the 60% criterion of the 337/red ratio and the existence of FUV emissions, we classify the 1039 GLIMS-observed lightning events into 828 pure lightning and 211 TLE-accompanied lightning. Since the GLIMS trigger level is adjusted to observe extremely-bright events, the occurrence probability of TLEs obtained here most probably reflects the characteristics of energetic lightning. The estimated global map is consistent with previously determined distributions: the highest activities of lightning and TLEs are found over the North/South American continents, African continent, and Asian maritime regions. While the absolute occurrence number of pure lightning and TLE-accompanied lightning are found to maximize in the equatorial region, the occurrence probability of TLEs possibly increase somewhat in the mid-latitude region. Since the occurrence probabilities of TLEs are higher over the ocean than over land, it is likely that the GLIMS-observed TLEs are due primarily to elves which tends to occur more frequently over the ocean.",""
"ship feature extraction from maritime radar data","1997","In large harbours and long channels where congested traffic and critical weather are present, VTS (vessel traffic service) systems are needed for traffic management and control. The requirements for these systems become more and more demanding because of the continuous increase of traffic and adverse meteorological conditions; reliable systems which can help the operators to avoid accidents which can jeopardise the security of people and goods have to be used to increase safety and efficiency. These systems employ mainly radar sensors, suitably placed in order to have a complete coverage of the area to be controlled, because a 24-hours operation in all weather conditions must be assured. In this paper a new methodology to process digitised radar images to extract object features (size, heading, etc.) is presented. Considering that ships arriving to, or departing from, harbours are big objects moving in narrow channels or waterways, information such as length and bow position are fundamental to control the ship movements, to evaluate the distance between two vessels, or between the vessel and fixed objects such as buoys or wharves. Results of extensive measurement campaign carried out in Naples, Leghorn and Genoa harbours are reported.","waterway,maritime radar data,length,traffic management,Feature extraction,bow position,ship feature extraction,harbours,radar sensors,digitised radar images,Leghorn harbour,feature extraction,vessel traffic service,object features,Genoa harbour,wharves,buoys,channels,Naples harbour,"
"large area monitoring with a modis-based disturbance index (di) sensitive to annual and seasonal variations","2009","Disturbance of the vegetated land surface, due to factors such as fire, insect infestation, windthrow and harvesting, is a fundamental driver of the composition forested landscapes with information on disturbance providing critical insights into species composition, vegetation condition and structure. Long-term climate variability is expected to lead to increases in both the magnitude and distribution of disturbances. As a consequence it is important to develop monitoring systems to better understand these changes in the terrestrial biosphere as well to inform managers about disturbance agents more typically captured through specific monitoring programs (such as focused on insect, fire, or agricultural conditions). Changes in the condition, composition and distribution pattern of vegetation can lead to changes in the spectral and thermal signature of the land surface. Using a 6-year time series of MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Land Surface Temperature (LST) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) data we apply a previously proposed Disturbance Index (DI) which has been shown to be sensitive to both continuous and discontinuous change. Using Canada as an example area, we demonstrate the capacity of this Disturbance Index to monitor land dynamics over time. As expected, our results confirm a significant relationship between area flagged as disturbed by the index and area burnt as estimated from other satellite sources (R2=0.78, p<0.0001). The DI also demonstrates a sensitivity to capture and depict changes related to insect infestations. Further, on a regional basis the DI produces change information matching measured wide-area moisture conditions (i.e., drought) and corresponding agricultural outputs. These findings indicate that for monitoring a large area, such as Canada, the time series based DI is a useful tool to aid in change detection and national monitoring activities.","Insect,Disturbance,Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI),Land Surface Temperature (LST),Drought,Coarse spatial resolution,Disturbance Index (DI),MODIS,Fire,"
"maritime target tracking algorithm based on visible light communication","2021","With the continuous growth of coastal industry, port logistics and other demands, traditional regulatory means have been unable to cope with the complex situations of port vessel regulation. In view of the fact that some monitoring points have blind areas in harbor-border inspection, this paper uses Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) to build an efficient automatic early warning and control system for port business, then a geometric algorithm for transmitter positioning is proposed by taking Received Signal Strength (RSS) as intermediate variable in Visible Light Communication (VLC) scene. On this basis, in order to further improve the calculation speed and accuracy, Linear Iterative Positioning (LIP) algorithm based on Taylor expansion, implicit function theorem and time domain expansion is proposed to realize the identification and positioning of maritime targets.

"quantifying shallow-buried maritime archaeological material using sbp acoustics: experimental and in-situ wrecksite survey approaches","2017","The protection of underwater cultural heritage through in-situ preservation as a first option has been consistently emphasised for preserving submerged and waterlogged cultural heritage for future generations. It has also been politically galvanised by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation in the 2001 Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage. The ultimate in-situ preservation goal for many heritage managers is the ability to create and maintain a stable, protective environment. However, as voiced at IKUWA6 international conference in December 2016, â€œif you don't know what's below the protective layer, then in-situ management is silly!â€ Sub-bottom profilers (SBP) have been effectively used for identifying buried pipelines, sedimentary/geological interfaces, and buried timbers where acoustic reflections are strong. The literature is sparse however, when it comes to quantifying the burial depth and material composition of shallow buried archaeological assemblages using non-invasive techniques. Acoustic devices that are relatively easy to operate in shallow coastal waters and provide improved horizontal and vertical resolution, together with the ability to image weak reflectors and those immediately below the seabed surface, are required for improved in-situ underwater cultural heritage management. This paper presents the progressive results using non-linear SBP acoustic technology to address the question â€œwhat is buried below the protective sediment layer?â€ The aim of the research is to quantify the depth of burial of archaeological material, the major buried material types and through time, their degradation state. The assessment is based on experimental and in-situ wreck site measurements. Seventeen `sleepers' (timbers 50 cm long and 12.5 cm wide and deep) of pine and European oak composition have been buried at the James Matthews (1841) wreck site, south of Fremantle, Western Australia, with 10 cm, 30 cm and 50 cm depths of coverage, and with horizontal and vertical grain orientations. The previously excavated, archaeologically surveyed and reburied remains of the snow brig James Matthews provides a complex shipwreck assemblage target in a shallow (0.2-3 m) burial environment. A virtual 3D digital model of the James Matthews shipwreck remains has been constructed for direct inter-comparison with the SPB survey data. Statistical analyses of the raw SBP data reflected from each of the replicated timber `sleeper' types and burial depths, and from the known material types and burial depths on the James Matthews wrecksite, will be used to quantify site specific acoustic, burial depth and material composition relationships.","waterlogged cultural heritage,in-situ wreck site measurements,seafloor phenomena,United Nations educational,buried timbers,maritime archaeological material,nonlinear SBP acoustic technology,James Matthews (1841,timber,IKUWA6 international conference,raw SBP data,material composition relationships,protective environment,in-situ preservation goal,noninvasive techniques,Acoustic beams,submerged heritage,Cultural differences,shallow buried archaeological assemblages,pipelines,acoustic reflections,Three-dimensional displays,burial depth,buried pipelines,Sediments,protective layer,Sub-bottom profiler,shallow coastal waters,scientific and cultural organisation,buried timber sleepers,in-situ wrecksite survey approaches,Acoustics,heritage managers,acoustics,improved in-situ underwater cultural heritage management,buried material types,burial depths,horizontal resolution,in-situ management,Acoustic measurements,Degradation,James Matthews wrecksite,SBP acoustics,archaeologically surveyed reburied remains,James Matthews wreck site,vertical resolution,replicated timber,shallow-buried maritime archaeological material,archaeology,3D digital model,acoustic devices,protective sediment layer,sediments,oceanographic techniques,"
"detection of invalid ais messages using machine learning techniques","2022","Coastal nations monitor maritime activities in the interest of defence, security, and safety. This form of monitoring typically occurs at operations centers that visualize the maritime environment by creating a Recognized Maritime Picture (RMP) covering a particular area of interest. The creation of this picture changed drastically with the introduction of the Automatic Identification System (AIS). AIS messages are known to contain numerous types of errors and in April 2020 a unique error was found in the data stream. This error consisted of messages indicating the appearance of over 200 vessels in the North Atlantic taking part in a yacht race when in fact no race or physical ships existed. The following work explores the application of various machine learning (ML) techniques to help identify these types of fabricated AIS messages. Specific ML techniques were explored including: K-means clustering, Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Feed-Forward Neural Networks (FNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and One-Class Support Vector Machines (One-SVM). The results showed that DT, RF, and FNN best identified the fabricated AIS messages with F1 scores greater than 93 percent on the test data.","maritime domain awareness,AIS,automatic identification system,machine learning,"
"assessment of trace metal contamination in surficial fine-grained sediments and mussel, mytilus galloprovincialis from safi areas in the northwestern atlantic coast of morocco","2020","During the spring season, trace metal concentrations of cadmium (Cd) and copper (Cu) were investigated in surficial fine-grained sediments and the blue mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis. The study was conducted on the Atlantic coast of Morocco at two selected points along Safi shores, a supposed clean station and a recognized metal-contaminated one. The main objectives were to assess the pollution status of these two stations and to highlight the environmental and human risks associated with metal contamination. The bioavailability and the bioaccumulation of the selected metals, several physiological and biometric parameters of mussels were assessed at both sampling stations. As expected, the station located near industry plants showed the highest metal concentrations in the two compartments and was associated with lower values in the physiological and biometric indices. At the mussel scale, inter-station and inter-tissue variations in metal concentrations were observed showing a preferential accumulation within the digestive gland. Besides, strong reliable negative relations of Cd and Cu concentrations were obtained with physiological indices. Surprisingly, a significant occurrence of both selected metals was recorded at the location assumed as a reference station. Therefore, the hypothesis that this station presumed to be clean and currently used as a control station must be reconsidered. As for the risk for the consumer, the estimated daily intake (EDI) of Cd and Cu indicated a potential health risk through mussel consumption since the EDI values were markedly above the international guidelines and threshold levels for human consumption. Finally, our data were compared to those previously obtained along the Safi coastline (NW Morocco) and other geographical regions, including the Mediterranean and western Atlantic areas within the temperate zone.","Bioaccumulation,Mediterranean blue mussel,Pollution indices,Risk assessment,Metal contamination,Marine sediments,"
"robust navigation and communication in the maritime domain: the triton project","2014","Intentional jamming and spoofing are growing concerns for communication and positioning systems based on Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS). In the maritime sector, intentional interfering signals might induce poor performance of the GNSS receivers, that, in severe cases, are unable to provide reliable measurements. On board of vessels, the failure of the GNSS receiver propagates to multiple systems, like the Automatic Information System (AIS) transponder, the ship's gyro calibration system and the digital selective calling system. The AIS itself can suffer from failures due to interference in the VHF band, and the lack of bandwidth makes it difficult to introduce security any security mechanisms. The vulnerability to intentional interference as well as the availability of personal privacy devices easily sold over the Internet motivate attackers who intend to fraud services and get direct benefits.","fraud services,ship gyro calibration system,GNSS receivers,transponders,Marine vehicles,TRITON project,digital selective calling system,security mechanisms,marine navigation,Global Positioning System,robust navigation,VHF band,interference suppression,intentional spoofing,positioning systems,intentional interfering signals,Ship Reporting Systems,ships,satellite navigation,automatic information system,Jamming,interference mitigation,maritime domain,radiofrequency interference,vessels,Robustness,AIS transponder,calibration,marine communication,Receivers,failure analysis,radio receivers,Interference,maritime sector,personal privacy devices,Internet,Global Navigation Satellite System,Security,security,intentional jamming,"
"origin and history of trace elements accumulation in recent mediterranean sediments under heavy human impact. a case study of the boka kotorska bay (southeast adriatic sea)","2022","The history of metal pollution in the semi-enclosed and human-influenced marine system of the Boka Kotorska Bay (Southern Adriatic) was studied considering geological composition of the surrounding catchment, the sedimentation rate and the mineralogical and early diagenetic processes in the recent sediments. The determination of background concentrations of metals, undertaken for the first time in this environment, proved to be particularly important for Ni and Cr, which are naturally enriched in the sediments of the southern Adriatic. The results showed widespread moderate contamination with Pb and Sn since the 1970s, while the upper layers of sediments near shipyards, marinas and urban areas were more contaminated with Sn, Cu, Pb, Zn, Cd, As, Sb and Mo. The transport of material through the narrow straits separating different parts of Boka Kotorska Bay resulted in a different geochemical composition of the smaller bays and a limited distribution of contaminated sediments from local sources.","Southern Adriatic,Metal pollution,History of pollution,Semi-enclosed marine system,Local background,"
"integrated late quaternary chronostratigraphy for san salvador island, bahamas: patterns and trends of morphological change in the land snail cerion","2008","Reconstructing the phylogeny and biogeography of the Caribbean land snail Cerion requires a robust stratigraphic and chronological framework. To this end, we have determined the stratigraphic succession on San Salvador, a Bahamian island with a rich fossil and modern Cerion fauna. A primary purpose of this paper is to independently verify this succession through whole-rock and Cerion aminostratigraphies and AMS 14C-based age models. Over 150 individual Cerion shells were age-ranked from 140 ka to modern using stratigraphic position and reverse-phase HPLC (RPC) amino acid racemization, which was sufficiently sensitive to resolve stratigraphic subunits within the Holocene and late Pleistocene. A secondary purpose of this paper is to assess broad changes in the gross morphology (height, width) of supersets of Cerion from age-ranked lots spanning this ~140 kyr chronostratigraphy. Through each of the three interglacial sequences (i.e., marine isotope stages 5e, 5a, and 1), between-sample trends in mean gross morphology often greatly exceed within-sample variances (±1σ). Live-collected Cerion exhibit a range in gross morphology that nearly encompasses that of the entire fossil sequence. A trend of increasing gross shell size characterizes each of the interglacial phases, with a major step-decrease between marine isotope stages 5a and 1. While between-unit variation is often great in Cerion from SSI, within-unit variation appears unimodal through the record.","land snails,Reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography,The Bahamas,San Salvador Islands,Accelerator mass spectrometry C chronology,Biostratigraphy,Amino acid racemization,"
"spatio-temporal analysis of aerosol optical depth using rotated empirical orthogonal function over the maritime continent from 2001 to 2020","2022","The deterioration in the annual air quality of the Maritime Continent (MC) is mainly caused by biomass burning haze (BBH) and the surrounding atmospheric conditions. This study aims to investigate the spatial and temporal variations of the aerosol optical depth (AOD) and its relationship with biomass burning and climate anomaly factors in the MC from 2001 to 2020. Using aerosol model reanalysis products from the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA-2), values of the aerosol optical depth (AOD) over the MC were collected and processed to obtain a better understanding of the characteristics of the aerosol loading over the MC. Using the varimax rotated empirical orthogonal function (REOF) approach, we assess the spatio-temporal distributions of the AOD over the MC from 2001 to 2020. The REOF maximized the variances explained for the primary modes and has shown clearer relationship between the spatiotemporal patterns of identified modes. The first three REOF modes of the AOD accounted for a total variance of 73.7%. The first mode (REOF1) explaining 35.8% is the main mode that represent fire burning that concentrated over the 0° latitude. REOF1 represents the emission from burning activities which primarily occurred in the Kalimantan and Sumatra based on their correlation with the total hotspots, which reach 0.73, which a certain extent of correlation with the climate anomalies, including El Niño, positive DM, and their coincidence. The second (REOF2) also explaining 35.8% represents the AOD distribution influenced by the biomass burning emission transported from the Indochina in the area to the north of 5°N which has an opposite mode with the general mode in MC except for Java area. Meanwhile, PC3 AOD has reduced to 2.2% in the rotation process and represent the influence of monsoon movement on the AOD level. In short, the study highlights spatial and temporal AOD distribution and the phenomena of burning mass and climate indices in the long-term MERRA reanalysis dataset to allow more understanding of the causal links of AOD in MC to the climate features.","Indian ocean dipole,Aerosol optical depth,El Niño southern oscillation,Maritime continent,"
"integrated characterization of ancient burial mounds using ert and limited drillings at the hepu han tombs, in coastal area of southern china","2019","The Hepu Han Tombs, located on the south coast of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, in southern China, bordering the Beibu Gulf, can date back to the Han dynasty (206 BCE–220 CE), when Hepu was an important international trade port of the maritime Silk Road, spreading strong and persistent cultural influence to neighboring countries from ancient China, and also connecting China with African, European and other Asian countries in national migration, religious communication, political, trade, technical and cultural exchanges, and so on. The research of the Hepu Han Tombs can offer opportunities to understand the burial customs and the Han culture in the Chinese Han Dynasty. With the aim of detecting the location, depth and geometry of two burial mounds at Jinjiling Site of Hepu Han Tombs, an electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) survey was performed in cooperation with archaeological team to calibrate the results with detailed information from the limited drillings in the area. Besides, series of 2-D ERT sections, acquired above the larger mound, were combined into a “Pseudo 3-D” volume, and iso-resistivity surfaces were further calculated to emphasize the location and lateral variations within the data volume, expected towards a more detailed and quantitative interpretation. Both the 2-D and 3-D resistivity imaging gave a clear evidence of structural details of the burial mounds. The results have shown a general consistency between the geophysical work and traditional archaeological drilling explorations, improving our knowledge on the un-excavated mounds, and allowing detailed pre-excavation plan at the Hepu Han Tombs.","Burial mounds,Hepu Han Tombs,Electrical resistivity tomography (ERT),Drillings,"
"fostering marine internet with advanced maritime radio system using spectrums of cellular networks","2016","Marine Internet aims at providing Internet service in marine environments for applications on and under water surface. But now only satellite can provide such kind of service, which is expensive and not cost-effectively for ever-increasing human activities in the ocean. Meanwhile, the maritime radio system, which is primarily used by maritime transportation industry for navigation, distress handling as well as rescue and safety operations, also finds difficulties in satisfying ever-increasing demand on communication capacity to realize safe, green and intelligent maritime transport. This is mainly due to the fact that a limited amount of bandwidth is allocated to this system. Different from many proposals available in the literature, which address these two issues separately, this paper discusses an architecture to handle them together by exploiting the spectrums licensed to mobile cellular networks. It is expected to enhance the maritime radio system while fostering the deployment of marine Internet in water areas near coastlines with reduced deployment cost.","Satellites,licensed radio spectrum,marine Internet deployment,Marine Internet,maritime transport safety,bandwidth allocation,Mobile communication,maritime radio system,advanced maritime radio system,Internet service,cellular radio,Oceans,mobile cellular networks,intelligent maritime transport,Bandwidth,Satellite broadcasting,Web and internet services,green maritime transport,marine communication,Internet,frequency allocation,communication capacity,"
"stratigraphic pattern of soil remnants, cultural and colluvial deposits in a small dry valley in the viking settlement hedeby, northern germany","2023","This study aimed to identify spatial distribution of soil remnants, colluvial and cultural deposits in a small dry valley of the early medieval Viking settlement Hedeby; reconstruct factors of soil destruction and main phases of deposits formation. Hedeby (54° 29′ 27.77″ N, 9° 33′ 54.42″ E) is located approximately 40 km northwest of Kiel, Northern Germany, at the western shore of the lake Haddebyer Noor. The protected status of the settlement as a UNESCO heritage site predetermined the choice of a minimum-destructive technique of coring. The stratigraphy demonstrated that the main factors of soil destruction were surface erosion, incorporation of the soil horizon A into a cultural layer and extraction of soil material for earthwork formation such as construction of the semi-circular fortification rampart. Buried soil horizons were additionally mixed by active local bioturbation. Three periods of deposit formation were identified. The occurrence of soil erosion due to intensive deforestation in the earliest period of settlement erection was indicated by the deepest colluvial layer M1. During the Viking settlement period formation of the exposed colluvial layer M2 and cultural deposits must have been simultaneous but at different locations. After the Viking Age settlement period, the erosion was activated by agricultural land use in late medieval time. This was clearly seen in the central part of the valley, where cultural deposits were covered by colluvium. This study closes a gap in the long-term archaeological and geoarchaeological study of Hedeby, i.e. it contributes to the discussion of the relationship between human activity and landscape development in this significant settlement. Moreover, it brings new knowledge on the large-scale vision of the landscape transformation performed by Viking Age settlers.","Viking Age,Hedeby,Colluvial deposits,Deposit modeling,Past soil erosion,Palaeoenvironmental reconstruction,"

"ldsn: localization scheme for double-head maritime sensor networks","2014","Ocean covers nearly 71% of our planet's surface, yet 95% of the ocean remains unexplored by human being, and wireless sensor networks are envisioned to perform monitoring tasks over the large portion of our world. However, deploying wireless sensor networks on the sea poses many challenges and for maritime surveillance security applications we may need to deploy sensors both on the sea surface and underwater for three-dimensional detection. In this paper, we propose a hybrid ocean sensor networks called Double-head maritime Sensor Networks (DSNs), which combine the advantages of wireless sensor networks and underwater acoustic sensor networks. By leveraging the unique characteristics of DSNs, we design a localization scheme LDSN which is consisted of two algorithms SML and FLA. We first use SML to localize moored anchor nodes as seed nodes. After the underwater sensor networks have been localized, the floating double-head nodes can figure out its instant position via FLA algorithm. We evaluate the scheme by simulations and the results show that the scheme can achieve a high localization accuracy.","seed node,Wireless Sensor Networks,wireless sensor network,Wireless sensor networks,hybrid ocean sensor network,three-dimensional detection,underwater acoustic sensor network,maritime surveillance security application,sensor placement,wireless sensor networks,floating double-head node,Sea surface,FLA algorithm,LDSN,Tides,Underwater acoustics,moored anchor node,marine communication,Localization,Surveillance,double-head maritime sensor network,SML,Underwater Sensor Networks,localization scheme,"
"spectrum sensing for cognitive maritime vhf networks","2014","The Automatic Identification System (AIS) is used worldwide as a maritime system for identifying and locating vessels by exchanging data in Very High Frequency (VHF) band with other nearby ships, AIS base stations and satellites. It is an important system for safety of navigation to assist collision avoidance and enables marine traffic supervision and management. However, the expanding use of AIS band by other emerging applications and services has caused significant increase on the maritime VHF Data Link (VDL) load, hampering smooth exchange of critical AIS information. Instead of assigning new frequency resources for new marine VDL services, in this paper we present a solution to overcome this spectrum scarcity issue by utilizing Cognitive Radio (CR) technology in maritime AIS VHF network. A preliminary analysis of the performance of such an approach is carried out taking into account the different properties and challenges of marine communication channels due to sea surface movement. The outcome of our study shows how the application of CR techniques to maritime VDL indeed represents an appealing alternative to static spectrum allocation schemes to deal with overloading issues in AIS networks.","spectrum scarcity issue,Sea level,cognitive radio,static spectrum allocation schemes,Marine vehicles,radio spectrum management,VHF band,Transceivers,very high frequency band,automatic identification system,cognitive radio technology,maritime VHF data link load,Cognitive radio,sea surface movement,marine communication channels,cognitive maritime,signal detection,Fading,marine communication,maritime AIS VHF network,spectrum sensing,Detectors,"
"high-squint sar imaging of maritime ship targets","2022","High-squint synthetic aperture radar (HS-SAR) imaging technology greatly enhances the flexibility of SAR. However, the existing HS-SAR imaging algorithms are generally based on the assumption that the illuminated target is static during the synthetic aperture formation. As a consequence, the state-of-the-art algorithms are unable to focus on moving targets well, thus leading to displaced and blurred images of the targets. A maritime ship is a typical kind of moving target with complex noncooperative motion, which has received much attention. Thus, it is a difficult but valuable issue to study HS-SAR imaging of ship targets. In this work, the influence of ship translation and fluctuation is theoretically analyzed. On the basis of these analyses, the new conception of â€œthird range compression (TRC)â€ caused by ship translation is proposed, and the squint minimization (SM) operation is implemented for the compensation of TRC. Moreover, considering that the target Doppler parameters induced by ship fluctuation are related to its position, a novel method called WASH-CLEAN (watershed and CLEAN) is proposed to automatically focus ship scattering points with different swings. Finally, we propose an integrated modified range-Doppler (RD) imaging algorithm by combining the advantages of HS-SAR and inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR). The simulation results show the validity and effectiveness of the presented method.","ISAR,high-squint SAR imaging,synthetic aperture formation,TRC,HS-SAR imaging algorithms,Chirp,high-squint synthetic aperture radar,maritime ship target,target Doppler parameters,modified range-Doppler (RD) algorithm,blurred images,Marine vehicles,illuminated target,squint minimization operation,inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR),ships,maritime ship targets,ship translation,synthetic aperture radar,radar imaging,Sea state,Doppler effect,WASH-CLEAN,Azimuth,Doppler radar,Radar imaging,ship scattering points,Imaging,High-squint synthetic aperture radar (HS-SAR),ship fluctuation,third range compression,integrated modified range-Doppler imaging algorithm,inverse synthetic aperture radar,"
"change detection support for supervisory controllers of highly automated systems: effects on performance, mental workload, and recovery of situation awareness following interruptions","2018","Dynamic Positioning (DP) is a computer-controlled process to automatically keep a floating vessel at a specific position or to follow a pre-defined path (tracking) by using its own propellers and thrusters. The human supervisory controller has no direct need to constantly know what the status is of all parts of the automation and the system it is controlling, because the highly automated DPS is controlling all components itself. Only after a failure arises, the operator needs to take over manual control and take appropriate action(s) to prevent the failure from harming the operation. As the supervisory controller may be out of the loop, swiftly taking over control may be problematic when failures arise. The purpose of the current study was to investigate whether automation of change detection enables human operators with low awareness of the automation and the system it is controlling to quickly recover awareness in emergency take-over situations. A 2 by 2 within subjects experiment was conducted using a DP simulation (n = 22). Within-subjects factors were support (Yes, No) and interruption (Yes, No). Results showed that change detection support helps in the process of recovering situation awareness after it has been reduced, due to an interruption of the primary task of overseeing the automation. Interestingly, support was not beneficial to the participants in all conditions. In non-interrupted conditions the support unexpectedly resulted in higher workload, raising questions whether supervisory controllers should be supported continuously or only when it is required. Relevance to industry: The results show that change detection support has potential value in operational maritime environments, especially in situations where the DP operator has low situation awareness. Future research should investigate whether adaptive aiding could alleviate some of the negative effects of non-adaptive operator support in maritime environments.","Management-by-exception,Situation Awareness Recovery (SAR),Dynamic positioning,Human-automation collaboration,Out-of-the-loop (OOTL) performance problem,"
"context-enhanced vessel prediction based on ornstein-uhlenbeck processes using historical ais traffic patterns: real-world experimental results","2014","Traffic route analysis and prediction are both essential for maritime security. Specifically, the prediction of a vessel position is useful to provide alerts about upcoming events (e.g., opportunities and threats). However, accurate prediction along a route in the maritime domain is a challenging task, due to the complex and dynamic nature of traffic patterns. This paper presents a vessel prediction method, based on the popular Ornstein-Uhlenbeck stochastic processes, whose parameters are estimated from historical patterns of life. The historical traffic routes are obtained by pre-processing Automatic Identification System (AIS) data via the CMRE tool called Traffic Route Extraction for Anomaly Detection (TREAD). These recurrent routes allow prediction of the position of a vessel that is following one of these routes, surprisingly, by several hours. The method is validated using a case study related to the second data campaign of the EC FP7 Project New Service Capabilities for Integrated and Advanced Maritime Surveillance (NEREIDS)1.

"estimating the effect of decision deviation spreading in networked synergetic emergency decision-making environment: a case study on maritime accident disposition","2019","The generation and propagation of human error will have a great impact on the decision-making in emergency environment. The analysis of the model and mechanism of human error and its propagation is of great significance to the study of emergency decision-making. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a decision failure model based on confidence rule (BRB) reasoning. Individual decision-making is taken as a node in workflow, and the network workflow among decision-making units is examined in a larger scope by establishing the interactive network between nodes. On this basis, the control model of human decision-making errors is further constructed, including the accumulation, transmission and correction of decision-making errors. Finally, taking maritime emergency rescue as an example, this paper studies the capability of the fault control model to identify and correct faults in the decision-making workflow. The research shows that the model can describe the degree of decision deviation of the decision-making unit, and reflect the control and correction function of the decision workflow on the decision error to some extent.","workflow,marine accidents,maritime accident disposition,Transportation,emergency management,decision failure model,Marine vehicles,networked synergetic emergency decision-making environment,confidence rule reasoning,Organizations,human factors,decision deviation,Decision making,interactive network,Accidents,decision-making workflow,maritime emergency rescue,decision making,fault control model,human error,decision error,human decision-making errors,human error control,fault tolerant control,Belief rule base,Cognition,Task analysis,maritime decision-making,marine control,"

With delay and energy consumption as constraints, the revenue function for task offloading path is designed. The function comprehensively considers network resources, channel transmission and node execution ability, thereby achieving the reliable task offloading.

"uav-assisted data offloading for smart container in offshore maritime communications","2022","Smart containers have been extensively applied in the maritime industry by embracing the Internet of Things to realize container status monitoring and data offloading without human intervention. However, the offloading rate and delay in the offshore region are limited by the coverage of the onshore base station (BS). In this paper, we investigate the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted data offloading for smart containers in offshore maritime communications where the UAV is as a relay node between smart containers and onshore BS. We first consider the mobility of container vessel in the offshore region and establish a UAV-assisted data offloading model. Based on this model, a data offloading algorithm is proposed to reduce the average offloading delay under data-size requirements and available energy constraints of smart containers. Specifically, the convex-concave procedure is used to update time-slot assignment, offloading approach selection, and power allocation in an iterative manner. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can efficiently reduce average offloading delay and increase offloading success ratio. Moreover, it is shown that the UAV relay cannot always bring the performance gain on offloading delay especially in the close-to-shore area, which could give an insight on the deployment of UAV relay in offshore communications.","data offloading algorithm,average offloading delay,offshore maritime communications,time-slot assignment update,smart container,offshore communications,container status monitoring,offloading rate,convex programming,Monitoring,Delays,UAV relay,offloading approach selection,data-size requirements,concave programming,Containers,Relays,Maritime communications,unmanned aerial vehicle,data offloading,freight containers,Data models,UAV-assisted data offloading model,offshore region,container vessel,maritime Internet of Things,unmanned aerial vehicle-assisted data offloading,Autonomous aerial vehicles,offloading success ratio,autonomous aerial vehicles,telecommunication traffic,marine communication,"

"bio-inspired topology control mechanism for autonomous underwater vehicles used in maritime surveillance","2013","Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are increasingly used in maritime applications to acquire underwater information. With the guidance of intelligent topology control algorithms, AUVs adjust their positions efficiently such that they achieve desired underwater wireless sensor network (UWSN) configurations. A suitable application can be using AUVs in surveillance tasks, where they uniformly spread throughout a harbor entry or around a large civilian or military maritime vessel (e.g., an aircraft carrier) to detect any hostile or unexpected underwater intrusions. Since geographical characteristics are different for each port (shape, depth, etc.) and underwater currents constantly change, manually controlling underwater vehicles for these tasks is not feasible. In this paper, we present a particle swarm optimization (PSO) based topology control mechanism, called 3D-PSO, for AUVs operating in unknown 3D underwater spaces. 3D-PSO uses limited information collected from an AUV's neighborhood to make movement decisions over an unknown 3D space. Each AUV, using our 3D-PSO, is able to adjust its movement speed and direction to achieve a better location towards obtaining a uniform distribution. Simulation experiments demonstrate that, despite the significant variance of topographies of harbor entrances and the undersides of ships, 3D-PSO is an efficient tool to guide AUVs in creating a protection area for a harbor or a maritime vessel.","surveillance,topology control,bio-inspired topology control mechanism,harbor entrances,underwater information,civilian vessel,bio-inspired algorithms,particle swarm optimisation,3D-PSO,underwater wireless sensor networks,protection area,Network topology,wireless sensor networks,Topology,maritime surveillance,self-organizing networks,particle swarm optimization,autonomous underwater vehicles,Underwater vehicles,unknown 3D underwater spaces,harbor entry,surveillance tasks,military maritime vessel,Nickel,UWSN configurations,marine vehicles,intelligent topology control algorithms,underwater wireless sensor network configuration,AUVs,security,unexpected underwater intrusion detection,Mobile nodes,geographical characteristics,"

"threat assessment using context-based tracking in a maritime environment","2009","The main objective of this work is to model and exploit available maritime contextual information to provide a hypothesis on suspicious vessel maneuvers. This concept involves utilizing the L1 tracking to perform L2/L3 data fusion, i.e. refinement and assessment for situations and threats. A new context-based tracker known as the ConTracker is developed. The purpose of the ConTracker is to incorporate the contextual information into a traditional alpha - beta tracker in such a way so that it provides a repeller or an attractor characteristics to a specific region of interest. Any behavior of the vessel that is inconsistent with the repeller or the attractor characteristics of the current vessel location would be classified as suspicious. Such an inconsistent vessel behavior would be directly indicated by a high measurement residual which may be used to estimate an accurate process noise covariance using a multiple-model adaptive estimator. Based on the rate of change of the estimated process noise covariance values, an L2/L3 hypothesis generator red-flags the target vessel. Simulation results indicate that the context based tracking enhances the reliability of erratic maneuver detection.","Traffic control,multiple-model adaptive estimator,Noise generators,L2/L3 fusion,Î± - Î² tracker,Motion estimation,Noise measurement,target tracking,marine systems,State estimation,threat assessment,Aerospace engineering,Target tracking,covariance analysis,contextual information,Trafficability,MMAE,Fusion power generation,context-based tracking,adaptive estimation,suspicious vessel maneuvers,process noise covariance,erratic maneuver detection reliability,maritime environment,Boats,Context modeling,ConTracker,"
"seasonal oceanography from physics to micronekton in the south-west pacific","2015","Tuna catches represent a major economic and food source in the Pacific Ocean, yet are highly variable. This variability in tuna catches remains poorly explained. The relationships between the distributions of tuna and their forage (micronekton) have been mostly derived from model estimates. Observations of micronekton and other mid-trophic level organisms, and their link to regional oceanography, however are scarce and constitute an important gap in our knowledge and understanding of the dynamics of pelagic ecosystems. To fill this gap, we conducted two multidisciplinary cruises (Nectalis1 and Nectalis2) in the New Caledonian Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) at the southeastern edge the Coral Sea, in 2011 to characterize the oceanography of the region during the cool (August) and the hot (December) seasons. The physical and biological environments were described by hydrology, nutrients and phytoplankton size structure and biomass. Zooplankton biomass was estimated from net sampling and acoustics and micronecton was estimated from net sampling, the SEAPODYM ecosystem model, a dedicated echosounder and non-dedicated acoustics. Results demonstrated that New Caledonia is located in an oligotrophic area characterized by low nutrient and low primary production which is dominated by a high percentage of picoplankton cyanobacteria Prochlorococcus (>90%). The area exhibits a large-scale north–south temperature and salinity gradient. The northern area is influenced by the equatorial Warm Pool and the South Pacific Convergence Zone and is characterized by higher temperature, lower salinity, lower primary production and micronekton biomass. The southern area is influenced by the Tasman Sea and is characterized by cooler temperature, higher salinity, higher primary production and micronekton biomass. The dynamic oceanography and the complex topography create a myriad of mesoscale features including eddies, inducing patchy structures in the ecosystem. During the cool season, a tight coupling existed between the ocean dynamics and primary production, while there was a stronger decoupling during the hot season. There was little difference in the composition of mid-trophic level organisms (zooplankton and micronekton) between the two seasons. This may be due to different turn-over times and delays in the transmission of primary production to upper trophic levels. Examination of various sampling gears for zooplankton and micronekton showed that net biomass estimates and acoustic-derived estimates compared reasonably well. Estimates of micronekton from net observations and the SEAPODYM model were in the same range. The non-dedicated acoustics adequately reproduced trends observed in zooplankton from nets, but the acoustics could not differentiate between zooplankton and micronekton and absolute biomasses could not be calculated. Understanding the impact of mesoscale features on higher trophic levels will require further investigation and patchiness induced by eddies raises the question of how to best sample highly dynamic areas via sea experiments.","Primary production,Oceanographic surveys,Oligotrophic,Zooplankton,Acoustic data,Mesoscale eddies,Nekton,"
"a systematic mapping study on edge computing approaches for maritime applications","2021","Background: The edge computing paradigm allows to reduce latency and response time of applications by bringing computations and data storage closer to the locations where they are needed. Edge computing is used in different kinds of Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Maritime represents an important application domain for IoT applications and edge computing solutions. Modern vessels employ many different types of sensors, which produce a massive amount of data. Edge computing allows to perform computations and data analyses on-board a vessel or at the edge of the network. Objective: To present a comprehensive, unbiased overview of the state-of-the-art on edge computing approaches for maritime applications. Method: A Systematic Mapping Study (SMS) of the existing edge computing approaches for maritime applications. Results: A taxonomy of 17 papers on edge computing approaches for maritime applications. Conclusion: The results of the study show that there is a small number of existing edge computing approaches for maritime applications. Most of the existing approaches focus mainly on monitoring and communication functions in vessels.

"combining fm broadcast, accelerometers, ieee 892.15.4 wireless and gps to secure maritime containers worldwide","2010","There are approximately 50 million maritime style containers entering and leaving ports in North America every year and 500 millions worldwide [8]. The interiors of such containers are rarely inspected. With market globalization, a large amount of these containers enter North America on a daily basis. Such containers may include contraband or dangerous items that present an economic or security risk. Despite significant security improvements, only 3 to 5% of the maritime containers, that arrive in or transition through North America, go through physical inspection. Current container tracking technologies solely based on GPS consume high DC power, are costly, require line-of-sight with satellites and they are often too large to be covert. It is possible to overcome some of these limitations by combining GPS with a tracking system based on the FM broadcast signal. Digital FM broadcast is an alternative man-made signal that is ubiquitous, provides a geographically unique frequency spectrum and is about 100,000 as strong as a GPS satellite signal. The combination of GPS and FM, called 'Broadcast Assisted GPSâ„¢' allows the development of a low-cost, low-power and miniature FM-GPS receiver that can trace the path that a container has taken for less than 25$ per container. This paper presents the first results of highway trials (train and sea trials are to be conducted in 2010-2011) of such a low cost, covert, 'Broadcast Assisted GPS'based technology, called 'FM-RFID Tagâ„¢' that records the worldwide displacement of containers and displays the path undertaken by the container while in transit. As an added security benefit, the tag is also capable of detecting container intrusion, either door or side panel intrusion.","accelerometers,container tracking,container intrusion,FM broadcast,Monitoring,Global Positioning System,maritime containers,object tracking,Containers,Noise,IEEE 892.15.4 wireless,Maritime container intrusion sensor and Active RFID,sea ports,USA Councils,containers,GPS,Logic gates,radiofrequency identification,Receivers,Maritime container traceability,tracking system,"
"reinforcement learning-based adaptive pid controller for dps","2020","A conventional PID controller for the DPS has limitations due to fixed gains and dependence on manual adjustment for its gains. Therefore, several previous studies developed a fuzzy-based adaptive PID controller for the DPS which tunes the gains based on the fuzzy logic. However, the fuzzy logic has its disadvantages due to a manual definition of fuzzy rules and fuzzy variables. To overcome those limitations, a deep reinforcement learning algorithm is adopted to learn the efficient adaptive gain-tuning strategy without human intuition behind since it does not require any prior knowledge about the dynamics of a ship or DPS. Finally, it is shown that the proposed system can result in better station-keeping performance without deterioration in its control efficiency.","Proportional-integral-derivative (PID),Dynamic positioning system (DPS),Deep reinforcement learning (DRL),Deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG),Fine-tuning,"
"spatial patterns of landside trade impedance in containerized south american exports","2017","The paper addresses claims implicating higher domestic transportation costs as a significant barrier to Latin America's trade and economic integration - and the region's inadequate transportation infrastructure as the primary cause. The relative “trade space” for U.S.-bound containerized shipments is delineated via reverse spatial interaction modeling. Reconfiguration and reverse calibration of the doubly constrained spatial interaction model is used to derive functional distances between origins and ports of export, as a means of estimating a Trade Impedance Quotient (TIQ) for trade flows at the scale of the continent. Global and local statistics of spatial autocorrelation are then used to analyze the spatial pattern of trade impedance. With this approach, the analysis of containerized flows establishes the existence, extent, location, and spatial distribution of discrepancies in South American landside trade impedance. A large share of trade flows have trade impedance that is disproportionate to distance. Trade impedance at origins is spatially clustered for the total dataset and randomly distributed for commodity segments, and randomly distributed at destinations. Potential focus areas for high trade impedance are identified.","Spatial interaction modeling,South America,Relative space,Trade Impedance Quotient (TIQ),Trade impedance,Spatial autocorrelation,"
"cyber-physical framework for early integration of autonomous maritime capabilities","2013","The increasing demand for more self-governed assistance in maritime activities is leading ocean engineering research projects to combine diverse autonomous capabilities developed at geographically-dispersed locations. Availability of such capabilities as well as experiments in water is a critical issue that can seriously impact on the project milestones. The ability to perform verification and validation at an initial integration stage of maritime capabilities while they are still physically located at the partner's site can reduce significantly costs and risks. This paper proposes an early integration framework for autonomous capabilities of maritime vehicles by means of system and context simulation (including emulation of maritime vehicles and operational environment). This makes interaction between the computational and physical process become crucial as in cyber-physical systems. The framework proposed allows project patterns to pre-verify and pre-validate requirements before the system is physically integrated.

"an identity-based data integrity auditing scheme for cloud-based maritime transportation systems","2023","With the development of Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled Maritime Transportation Systems (MTS), massive data generated in the system not only requires to be stored reliably and cheaply, but also needs to be analyzed timely. The Cloud-based Maritime Transportation Systems (CMTS) allow users to upload the data without worrying about the price, capacity, location and so on. However, CMTS also brings some security issues, where the integrity protection of outsourced data is one of the most important issues since it is crucial for the safety, reliability and efficiency of sea lanes. To solve this problem, we propose an identity-based dynamic data integrity auditing scheme for CMTS. Our scheme decreases the burden of key management and improves the auditing efficiency by batch auditing. Besides, our scheme also supports dynamic operations on the outsourced data for CMTS. The security analysis shows that our scheme can ensure the feature of storage correctness and resist common attacks. In addition, the performance comparison results with other related schemes show that our scheme not only has the lowest computational cost on all entities, but also greatly reduces the communication overhead of the auditing phase. Therefore, our scheme is very suitable for data integrity verification in CMTS.","dynamic operations,Transportation,data integrity,Public key,outsourced data,Internet of Things,transportation,identity-based integrity auditing,reliability,CMTS,related schemes,Cloud-based Maritime Transportation Systems,Servers,batch auditing,Maritime transportation systems,cloud computing,storage management,massive data,outsourcing,data integrity verification,Data integrity,auditing,cloud storage,identity-based data integrity auditing scheme,Cloud computing,Computational modeling,Things-enabled Maritime Transportation Systems,Security,data integration,auditing efficiency,integrity protection,identity-based dynamic data integrity auditing scheme,"

In this paper, multi-target tracking and data fusion techniques are applied to real data recorded by three low-power HFSW radars installed in the German Bight of the North Sea. Ship reports from the automatic identification system (AIS) are exploited as ground truth information for assessing system performances.

"collision risk inference system for maritime autonomous surface ships using colregs rules compliant collision avoidance","2021","Maritime autonomous surface ships (MASS) need to be sufficiently safe to gain commercial acceptance. Collision avoidance strategies in such MASS should comply with the International Regulations for Preventing Collision at the Sea (COLREGs). According to the COLREGs, collision risk assessment, which determines the optimal positioning and timing via all available means appropriate to the prevailing circumstances and conditions, is crucial for preventing collisions. However, existing collision risk assessment methods do not consider all vital factors for the COLREGs rules compliant collision avoidance. We propose a collision risk inference system for MASS that complies with COLREGs vital rules for collision avoidance as follows: 1) actions to avoid collision are defined according to the degree of danger, and a suitable response distance is determined; 2) a collision risk index according to the enlarged ship domain based on the designated response distance by each level is set; 3) all vital factors of the COLREGs rules compliant collision avoidance are extracted as the data when the ship domain enlarged by each level is overlapped; 4) the collision risk inference system is developed by learning extracted data via the adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system. In contrast to existing research, the proposed system considers all vital variables in the COLREGs rules compliant collision avoidance guidelines, thereby improving the timings and positionings of the potential collision warning. Consequently, it could secure more time for decision making to take necessary collision prevention action.","marine accidents,existing collision risk assessment methods,Risk management,Preventing Collision,maritime autonomous surface ships,Marine vehicles,fuzzy reasoning,aerospace safety,collision risk index,necessary collision prevention action,Collision avoidance strategies,ships,marine safety,Accidents,Collision avoidance,Shape,risk management,Sea surface,decision making,ship domain,COLREGs vital rules,Adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system,risk analysis,potential collision warning,near-collision accident,COLREGs rules compliant collision avoidance guidelines,COLREGs,collision risk inference system,Navigation,collision avoidance,"

"dbscan algorithm for ais data reconstruction","2021","Automatic Identification System (AIS) is a telecommunication system created to allow ships to communicate with each other by exchanging messages containing information such as vessel’s ID, position, speed, heading, etc. AIS is useful in many cases, such as early ship collision detection. However, its terrestrial segment’s drawback is a relatively low range (about 74 km, roughly 40 nautical miles). Satellite Automatic Identification System (SAT-AIS) was introduced to overcome this limitation, but it suffers from its own problem known as packet collision. The satellite receives messages from multiple terrestrial cells and communication is synchronized within such cells, but not between them, thus messages got lost or damaged when they appear at the satellite at the same time. In this paper, we present a machine learning-based approach to reconstruct those missing messages and deeply investigate whether or not a density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) can be considered in the first stage of the reconstruction. The experiment focuses on findig the optimal parameters for the clustering, running it both on original and damaged data to finally ascertain that DSBCAN can distinguish individual trajectories in a dataset that can be further reconstructed.","clustering,DBSCAN,AIS data analysis,trajectory reconstruction,AIS,"
"vegetation and climate change, fire-regime shifts and volcanic disturbance in chiloé continental (43°s) during the last 10,000 years","2015","Disentangling the roles of paleofires and explosive volcanism from climatic drivers of past vegetation change is a subject insufficiently addressed in the paleoecological literature. The coastal region of the Chiloé Continental sector of northwestern Patagonia is ideal in this regard considering its proximity to active eruptive centers and the possibility of establishing comparisons with more distal, upwind sites where volcanic influence is minimal. Here we present a fine-resolution pollen and macroscopic charcoal record from Lago Teo with the aim of documenting the local vegetation and climate history, and assessing the role of disturbance regimes as drivers of vegetation change during the last ∼10,000 years. The Lago Teo record shows a conspicuous warm/dry interval between ∼7500 and 10,000 cal yrs BP followed by a cooling trend and increase in precipitation that has persisted until the present, in agreement with previous studies in the region and interpretations of past southern westerly wind activity at multi-millennial scales. The presence of 26 tephras throughout the record allows examination of the relationship between explosive volcanism and vegetation change under contrasting climatic states of the Holocene. We found consistent statistically significant increases in Tepualia stipularis after tephra deposition over the last 10,000 years, in Eucryphia/Caldcluvia between 7500 and 10,000 cal yrs BP and in Hydrangea over the last 7500 years.

This paper presents a maritime communication network architecture where the onshore high-tower base station provides wireless backhaul for the shipborne base stations, while the shipborne base stations serve as the mobile access points for the user ships. Under this architecture, considering the out-of-band full-duplex (OBFD) backhauling mode, we propose a joint backhaul and access link resource management scheme in respect to the wireless backhaul power allocation, access link power allocation and user association, for the sake of maximizing the network capacity. Specially, this scheme takes the inter-cell interference and the multiuser association into account in order to model the realistic maritime communication scenarios.

"an unambiguous imaging method of moving target for maritime scenes with spaceborne high-resolution and wide-swath sar","2022","In azimuth multichannel high-resolution and wide-swath (AMC-HRWS) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) system, undersampling of azimuth signal results in the failure of the single-channel echo imaging, so the echoes of all the channels should be reconstructed to obtain the unambiguous SAR image. Many methods have been proposed to reconstruct the stationary scene echoes. However, moving targets (MTs) will cause false targets in the reconstructed SAR image, which has a great influence on SAR image interpretation and moving target detection, especially in maritime scenes. Hence, we propose an unambiguous imaging method of the moving target for maritime scenes with AMC-HRWS SAR. First, azimuth deramp processing is introduced to obtain coarse-focused moving targets, and then their echoes can be extracted from the sea clutter. Based on the extracted data, a radial velocity estimation method is proposed, which is high efficiency and does not require redundant channels. In addition, based on the estimated radial velocity and the characteristics of the coarse-focused signal, a novel signal reconstruction method of moving target is presented. The reconstruction performance of this method is not affected by channel imbalance, and false targets can be removed even if there is radial velocity error. Besides, the effectiveness of this scheme is verified by the simulation data and GaoFen-3 SAR real data. The estimated radial velocities of ships are verified by automatic identification system (AIS) information. The imaging results show that false targets are effectively suppressed, and moving targets are located in correct positions.","moving target detection,GaoFen-3 SAR real data,stationary scene echoes,SAR image interpretation,Image reconstruction,image resolution,azimuth multichannel high-resolution,image sampling,wide-swath SAR,single-channel echo imaging,Synthetic aperture radar,Signal reconstruction,high-resolution and wide-swath (HRWS),AMC-HRWS SAR,false targets,object detection,synthetic aperture radar,radial velocity estimation method,signal reconstruction,unambiguous imaging method,image reconstruction,radar imaging,Doppler effect,moving target (MT) signal reconstruction,novel signal reconstruction method,radial velocity estimation,maritime scenes,Azimuth,spaceborne high-resolution,unambiguous SAR image,Imaging,maritime scene,Estimation,synthetic aperture radar (SAR),reconstructed SAR image,Azimuth multichannel (AMC),"

The proposed spatiotemporal clustering algorithm spatially clusters vessels in the water space using k-means clustering analysis, kinematically refines the clusters based on the similarity of vessel headings, speeds and the distance between them, and temporally analyzes the continuity of membership of the kinematic clusters through time to determine which clusters are moving.

"optimal offloading of computing-intensive tasks for edge-aided maritime uav systems","2022","This paper considers the autonomous detecting and tracking task of the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in the maritime environment. In the maritime UAV tracking system, due to the large size of the image computing-task and the shortage of UAV batteries and computational capability, the UAV needs to offload the computing-intensive task to the edge computing server (ECS) to reduce energy consumption and task latency. However, the task latency is still too long for the UAV tracking algorithm due to the large image size. We research the impact of image resolution on the computing task size and detection accuracy, and formulate an edge-aided UAV system with dynamic image resolution. With the constraint on task latency, we jointly optimize the image resolution, offloading rate, transmission power and local central processing unit (CPU) frequency to minimize energy consumption. Although the proposed problem is non-convex, we transform it into a convex optimization problem through decoupling and problem decomposition, and obtain an optimal offloading strategy. The numerical results show the energy efficiency of the proposed strategy by comparing it with the local first offloading strategy and the edge first offloading strategy.","Image edge detection,autonomous detecting,image resolution,Energy consumption,Vehicular and wireless technologies,edge computing server,image size,unmanned aerial vehicle,Target tracking,optimisation,edge computing,tracking task,convex optimization problem,UAV batteries,offload,visual target tracking,Autonomous aerial vehicles,power aware computing,computational capability,optimal offloading strategy,edge-aided maritime UAV systems,computing task size,autonomous aerial vehicles,marine engineering computing,dynamic image resolution,maritime environment,energy consumption,Image resolution,energy conservation,computing-intensive task,Transforms,UAV tracking algorithm,UAV,edge-aided UAV system,image computing-task,"
"a dual linear autoencoder approach for vessel trajectory prediction using historical ais data","2020","Advances in artificial intelligence are driving the development of intelligent transportation systems, with the purpose of enhancing the safety and efficiency of such systems. One of the most important aspects of maritime safety is effective collision avoidance. In this study, a novel dual linear autoencoder approach is suggested to predict the future trajectory of a selected vessel. Such predictions can serve as a decision support tool to evaluate the future risk of ship collisions. Inspired by generative models, the method suggests to predict the future trajectory of a vessel based on historical AIS data. Using unsupervised learning to facilitate trajectory clustering and classification, the method utilizes a cluster of historical AIS trajectories to predict the trajectory of a selected vessel. Similar methods predict future states iteratively, where states are dependent upon the prior predictions. The method in this study, however, suggests predicting an entire trajectory, where all states are predicted jointly. Further, the method estimates a latent distribution of the possible future trajectories of the selected vessel. By sampling from this distribution, multiple trajectories are predicted. The uncertainties of the predicted vessel positions are also quantified in this study.","Collision avoidance,Autoencoder,Trajectory prediction,AIS,Machine learning,Maritime situation awareness,"

"on-demand mec empowered uav deployment for 6g time-sensitive maritime internet of things","2021","With the emergence of sixth-generation (6G) mobile communication technologies, intelligent gadgets are expanding. Meanwhile, due to the fast rise of marine operations for trade, research, military, oil drilling, and recreational activities, the number of maritime internet-of-things (MIoT) devices is also expanding. On-demand deployment of multiaccess edge computing (MEC) empowered unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to meet the network coverage demand for MIoT devices at the seaside is presented. The MEC-UAVs are considered as reliable, cost-effective, and efficient for deployment and service provision to MIoT devices. The network profit maximization on MEC-UAV deployment and effective service allocation to MIoT devices is investigated.

"sediment geochemistry in coastal maritime antarctica (admiralty bay, king george island): evidence from rare earths and other elements","2007","We report the concentrations of 22 elements in short coastal sediment cores of Admiralty Bay (King George Island, Antarctica) determined by Neutron Activation Analysis. We focus the discussion on rare earth elements (REE) because their fractionation patterns in sediments relative to local sources may offer insights about weathering, transportation, deposition, and diagenetic processes. We found strong correlations between REE and Th, indicating detrital origin. Despite strong Eh gradients, the Th-normalized redox-sensitive elements (e.g., Eu, Ce, Fe, As, and others) showed little variability within the sedimentary environment. The exceptions were U (depleted in the upper few centimeters) and Br (enriched in the upper few centimeters). While U appears to be removed from seawater via uptake across the boundary of reducing sediments, the mechanisms driving Br accumulation are unclear, but perhaps related to increasing diatom production driven by regional warming. A comparison with published concentrations from rocks representing the regional eroding units showed that the characteristics of source rock could be recognized in the REE fractionation patterns in our sediments. These results imply no significant alteration during weathering and sediment transport in the coastal region of Admiralty Bay and the prevalence of strong periglacial erosion in ice-free areas of maritime Antarctica in spite of the relatively mild regional environmental setting (e.g., high moisture and high temperatures).","Heavy metal,Diagenesis,REE,NAA,Bromine,Sediment,Antarctica,Weathering,Coastal environment,"
"on the interest of hexagonal abstraction of maritime information","2022","Worldwide maritime traffic not only is expanding rapidly but also faces numerous fluctuations, sometimes downwards, due particularly to changes in socio-economic relations between countries, the recent pandemic situation, and conflicts that may affect strategic maritime areas or climate change that may, for example, affect the location of halieutic resources. The study of maritime mobilities and spaces is therefore more essential than ever.

"observing and understanding the southeast asian aerosol system by remote sensing: an initial review and analysis for the seven southeast asian studies (7seas) program","2013","Southeast Asia (SEA) hosts one of the most complex aerosol systems in the world, with convoluted meteorological scales, sharp geographic and socioeconomic features, high biological productivity, mixtures of a wide range of atmospheric pollutants, and likely a significant susceptibility to global climate change. This physical complexity of SEA is coupled with one of the world's most challenging environments for both in situ and remote sensing observation. The 7-Southeast Asian Studies (7SEAS) program was formed to facilitate interdisciplinary research into the integrated SEA aerosol environment via grass roots style collaboration. In support of the early 7SEAS program and the affiliated Southeast Asia Composition, Cloud, Climate Coupling Regional Study (SEAC4RS), this review was created to outline the network of connections linking aerosol particles in SEA with meteorology, climate and the total earth system. In this review, we focus on and repeatedly link back to our primary data source: satellite aerosol remote sensing and associated observability issues. We begin with a brief rationale for the program, outlining key aerosol impacts and, comparing their magnitudes to the relative uncertainty of observations. We then discuss aspects of SEA's physical, socio-economic and biological geography relevant to meteorology and observability issues associated with clouds and precipitation. We show that not only does SEA pose significant observability challenges for aerosol particles, but for clouds and precipitation as well. With the fundamentals of the environment outlined, we explore SEA's most studied aerosol issue: biomass burning. We summarize research on bulk aerosol properties for SEA, including a short synopsis of recent AERONET observations. We describe long range transport patterns. Finally, considerable attention is paid to satellite aerosol observability issues, with a face value comparison of common aerosol products in the region including passive and active aerosol products as well as fluxes. We show that satellite data products diverge greatly due to a host of known artifacts. These artifacts have important implications for how research is conducted, and care must be taken when using satellite products to study aerosol problems. The paper ends with a discussion of how the community can approach this complex and important environment.","Southeast Asia,Air Pollution,Biomass Burning,Aerosol,Meteorology,Remote Sensing,Maritime Continent,"
"identifying key features in aggregated real-life ais-messages for classification of maritime vessels by random forests","2023","Classification of vessels is a major task in many duties of maritime surveillance. In previous work, ad hoc approaches for classifying maritime vessels were applied to large sets of single AIS messages. The resulting performance has been explored based on real-life datasets in different maritime areas. The approaches were used in a particular application scenario of detecting AIS spoofing in fishery scenarios. Seeing good classification results, in particular by Random Forests, the questions arise whether these at least partly resulted from overfitting phenomena and which of the feature of classification in this problem are most relevant. To address these questions in the current contribution, AIS messages are aggregated per vessel and by the hour by statistical means providing a new AIS feature representation as a basis for classification. By providing a new data representation to the Random Forest classifier, we evaluate classification performance. Then we restrict the presented data to the semantic feature subgroups of the vesselâ€™s positional, course, speed, and dimensions data individually and identify the key features of the classification. The results show that in our exemplary maritime experiments, classification relies mostly on vesselsâ€™ positional and dimensional information.","Semantics,experimental comparison,aggregated messages,Random forests,Surveillance,Classification,Artificial intelligence,key features,Sensitivity,Task analysis,Behavioral sciences,performance evaluation,maritime surveillance systems,AIS,"
"container port performance measurement and comparison leveraging ship gps traces and maritime open data","2016","Container ports are generally measured and compared using performance indicators such as container throughput and facility productivity. Being able to measure the performance of container ports quantitatively is of great importance for researchers to design models for port operation and container logistics. Instead of relying on the manually collected statistical information from different port authorities and shipping companies, we propose to leverage the pervasive ship GPS traces and maritime open data to derive port performance indicators, including ship traffic, container throughput, berth utilization, and terminal productivity. These performance indicators are found to be directly related to the number of container ships arriving at the terminals and the number of containers handled at each ship. Therefore, we propose a framework that takes the ships' container-handling events at terminals as the basis for port performance measurement. With the inferred port performance indicators, we further compare the strengths and weaknesses of different container ports at the terminal level, port level, and region level, which can potentially benefit terminal productivity improvement, liner schedule optimization, and regional economic development planning. In order to evaluate the proposed framework, we conduct extensive studies on large-scale real-world GPS traces of container ships collected from major container ports worldwide through the year, as well as various maritime open data sources concerning ships and ports. Evaluation results confirm that the proposed framework not only can accurately estimate various port performance indicators but also effectively produces port comparison results such as port performance ranking and port region comparison.","open data,Productivity,container throughput,Ports (Computers),Throughput,regional economic development planning,performance indicators,liner schedule optimization,GPS traces,Marine vehicles,urban computing,Global Positioning System,port authorities,scheduling,port operation,terminal productivity improvement,statistical analysis,ships,Containers,shipping companies,container port performance measurement,marine engineering,berth utilization,container logistics,optimisation,Measurement,sea ports,comparison leveraging ship,maritime open data sources,logistics data processing,ship traffic,Container port,intelligent transportation system (ITS),statistical information,GPS trace,productivity,"
"dent damage identification in stiffened cylindrical structures using inverse finite element method","2020","The offshore industry has been using stiffened thin-walled steel cylindrical structures for decades, particularly as the columns of floating offshore installations. The floating offshore installations may be subjected to severe marine environmental conditions. Accidents such as collisions may also occur. Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) is a viable tool to maintain safe operation of offshore installations. Inverse Finite Element Method (iFEM) is one of the most powerful methods for SHM process. Hence, this study focuses on the application of iFEM methodology to thin-walled cylindrical structures representing the columns of floating offshore installations. iFEM methodology is verified by comparing its displacement results against reference finite element method (FEM) solution. After this verification, four different damage cases with different size, location and number of damages are considered. By using a newly introduced damage parameter and von Mises strain distribution iFEM accurately identified the correct damage locations and sizes. Therefore, it is concluded that iFEM can be used for structural damage prediction in offshore structures with high accuracy even if the number of the strain sensors is limited.","Structural health monitoring,Floating offshore installations,Stiffened cylinder,Inverse finite element method,"
"chapter 2 - secrets of bermuda triangle and formation of polymetallic nodules","2017","This chapter addresses two different awe-inspiring aspects primarily concerning the abyssal depths of the oceans; one (the Bermuda Triangle imbroglio) that is specific to the Atlantic Ocean, and the other (formation of polymetallic nodules (PMN)) that is common to the Pacific, Indian, and the Atlantic Oceans. The chapter begins with a brief general introduction, touching on both these diverse aspects. To meaningfully introduce the topic of the Bermuda Triangle imbroglio, some related aspects, such as the historical episode of fire breakout in the Japan Sea, and the trawler wreck in Witch’s Hole pockmark have been described. Subsequent discussion focus on other related aspects, including methane hydrate deposits in the seafloor sediment layer and their role in the Bermuda Triangle imbroglio, as well as the possible influence of the warm Gulf Stream in triggering methane gas emission, which, based on scientific evidence, is suspected to be the culprit in the sudden disappearances of ships and low-flying aircraft in the Bermuda Triangle region. The discussion is strengthened by invoking various scientific studies carried out to unlock the secret behind this dreaded story. The second part of this chapter addresses another interesting aspect of the ocean floor, namely, the carpet of “dark gold” (PMN) having been paved over by nature over a period of billions of years’ utterly slow growth (at the rate of 1–3mm/million years). The chapter attaches due importance to the devices used for collection of the dark gold from the abyssal ocean depths (paved on the ocean floor, as well as buried in thick sediments lying below the ocean floor’s water-sediment interface). Subsequent discussion on the dark nodules revolves around important aspects, such as their specialty and structure, factors influencing their formation, the role of nucleating materials, their shape and surface texture, internal features (thickness of oxide layer, internal microstructure), chemical composition, role of micro-organisms in their formation, and presence of rare earth elements. The chapter winds up with a discussion on the distribution of nodules in the world oceans.","Nucleus,Gas hydrates,Microstructure,Bermuda Triangle,Ocean basin,Pockmarks,Polymetallic nodules,Chemical composition,Todorokite,Fire,"

In this paper, a nested method for generating maritime rescue action plan is proposed. The specific steps are as follows. Firstly, a hierarchical scheme generation strategy is proposed. The scheme generation is mainly divided into two parts: task decomposition and resource scheduling. Then a task decomposition method based on genetic algorithm is established by learning the expert scheme. Through the mathematical modeling of the problem in the part of resource scheduling, a resource scheduling algorithm is proposed.

"synergistic abiotic and biotic stressors explain widespread decline of pinus pinaster in a mixed forest","2019","Global change potentially increases forest vulnerability. Different abiotic and biotic factors may interact to cause forest decline and accelerated tree mortality. We studied a mixed Mediterranean continental forest where Pinus pinaster Ait. (maritime pine) shows widespread decline to analyse the role of different abiotic and biotic factors on health status and growth dynamics both at the individual and plot levels. We also analysed stand composition and regeneration of tree species to check whether there is a change in species dominance. Fungal pathogens were seldom present and we detected no pervasive fungi or insect infestation and no presence of pathogens like Heterobasidion or Phytophthora. Infection of hemiparasite plants like Viscum album L. (mistletoe) can reduce leaf area and its abundance is generally considered an expression of host decline. Yet, the existence among declining trees of high defoliation levels without mistletoe, but not vice versa, suggests that defoliation in response to some abiotic stressor could be a predisposing factor preceding mistletoe infection. Compared to healthy trees, declining and dead trees exhibited higher defoliation rates, smaller needles and lower recent growth with steeper negative trends. Dead and declining trees showed similar negative growth trends since the early 1990s droughts, which we interpreted as early warning signals anticipating mortality of currently declining trees in the near future. Mortality of maritime pine extending across all size classes, the lower presence of this species in the smallest size classes and its lack of regeneration suggest it is potentially losing its current dominance and being replaced by other co-occurring, more drought-tolerant species. Our results unravelled that maritime pine decline seems to be mainly driven by a combination of predisposing and inciting abiotic factors (microenvironment and drought stress) and biotic factors (mistletoe). The absence of widespread fungal pathogens suggests that they may have a minor role on pine decline acting only eventually as contributing factors. Although there could be other interrelations among factors or other biotic agents at play, our results strongly suggest that water stress plays a major role in the decline process of the dominant species on an ecosystem with strong land-use legacies.","Abiotic stress,Mistletoe,Defoliation,Drought,Land-use,Fungal pathogens,"

"the last interglacial ocean","1984","The final effort of the CLIMAP project was a study of the last interglaciation, a time of minimum ice volume some 122,000 yr ago coincident with the Substage 5e oxygen isotopic minimum. Based on detailed oxygen isotope analyses and biotic census counts in 52 cores across the world ocean, last interglacial sea-surface temperatures (SST) were compared with those today. There are small SST departures in the mid-latitude North Atlantic (warmer) and the Gulf of Mexico (cooler). The eastern boundary currents of the South Atlantic and Pacific oceans are marked by large SST anomalies in individual cores, but their interpretations are precluded by no-analog problems and by discordancies among estimates from different biotic groups. In general, the last interglacial ocean was not significantly different from the modern ocean. The relative sequencing of ice decay versus oceanic warming on the Stage 6/5 oxygen isotopic transition and of ice growth versus oceanic cooling on the Stage 5e/5d transition was also studied. In most of the Southern Hemisphere, the oceanic response marked by the biotic census counts preceded (led) the global ice-volume response marked by the oxygen-isotope signal by several thousand years. The reverse pattern is evident in the North Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico, where the oceanic response lagged that of global ice volume by several thousand years. As a result, the very warm temperatures associated with the last interglaciation were regionally diachronous by several thousand years. These regional lead-lag relationships agree with those observed on other transitions and in long-term phase relationships; they cannot be explained simply as artifacts of bioturbational translations of the original signals.",""
"joint tracking and classification for extended targets in maritime surveillance","2018","In the framework of target tracking, joint tracking and classification (JTC) based approaches have been recently introduced to adjust the trajectory estimation to a given type of target. In a maritime surveillance framework, these approaches leverage marine radar capabilities to provide high resolution measurements. It can then be helpful to choose relevant motion models regarding the tracking algorithm. Among them, the authors recently proposed to take advantage of the target extent measurements for single or multiple-target tracking. This work was based on a point source hypothesis regarding the position measurement of each target. However, this is no longer suitable for extended target tracking. An extension of our previous work to track properly extended targets whose position measurement can be obtained from any point source of its surface is thus proposed. For this purpose, random matrix theory is leveraged.

"a voyage-based cooperative resource allocation scheme in maritime broadband access network","2017","Increasing marine activities taking place within the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) have made broadband maritime communications very attractive in recent years.

"submarine groundwater discharge detection through remote sensing: an application of landsat 7 and 8 in hawaiʻi and ireland","2022","Submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) represents an important component of the global water cycle. Improved assessment of SGD occurrences provides information to constrain current estimates of total freshwater discharges, which are crucial for evaluation of changes in the global water cycle. This study leverages SGD linkages to patterns in sea surface temperature (SST) and color. Typically, groundwater temperatures exhibit less variability than SST and tend to have temperature distinct from sea water. Consequently, thermally anomalous plumes often occur in coastal areas with SGD. Nutrient-enriched groundwater flows have been linked to changes in ocean color as a consequence of algae growth and of the presence of colored dissolved organic matter. Under such conditions, SGD presence may also manifest as plumes of different colors. Changes in SST and color can be captured through satellite imagery for the thermal infrared and visible bands, which are used here to detect potential SGD (PSGD) occurrences. A method based on clustering and spectroscopy techniques is applied to automatically detect PSGD plumes. SST data are clustered to map SST anomalies. Derivative analysis and angular distance are applied to identify a color signature linked to SGD. In a novel approach, SST and color are combined to identify PSGD through remote sensing. The methods presented in this study were applied to Landsat 7 and 8 imagery captured over southern Ireland and the west coast of the Island of Hawaiʻi, where past field surveys of radon isotopes activities and salinity have documented SGD occurrences. These selected sites are used as validation points. Derivative analysis and angular distance resulted in PSGD plumes in the vicinity of sampled locations, mainly locations with samples that are strong indicators of SGD. In general, the PSGD plumes derived from each method are compared as independent, parallel lines of evidence of PSGD occurrences. Results also show that PSGD pixels from derivative analysis and angular distance alone, without considering SST, can be obfuscated by confounding factors, such as low tides and unrelated chlorophyll enrichment, and that combining SST and color data reduces those effects. These results provide further evidence for PSGD occurrences along the south coast of Ireland and the west coast of the Island of Hawaiʻi, and showcase that satellite data can be used to better identify the location of PSGD occurrences over large areas.","Coastal waters,Submarine groundwater discharge,Ocean color,Sea surface temperature,"
"nmtlat: a new robust mobile multi-target localization and tracking scheme in marine search and rescue wireless sensor networks under byzantine attack","2020","After a shipwreck (ship collision, explosion, disappearance, etc.), people rely on the marine search and rescue wireless sensor networks (MSR-WSNs) as one key weapon to locate and track drowning targets to save lives and assets. However, due to the complex and dynamic ocean environment, marine sensors could be captured by malicious attackers and then become Byzantine sensors. Byzantine sensors may tamper with the actual sensor data at a fixed or time-varying probability and transmit it to the data fusion center (DFC), which renders the normal localization and tracking function of the search and rescue system downgrade or even fail. To address this issue, we develop a New robust marine mobile Multi-Target LocAlization and Tracking scheme called NMTLAT by eliminating abnormal measurement data from the initial measurement data. NMTLAT works in several steps. By analyzing and mining sensors data and behavior, we firstly employ the information entropy of the system composed of a single sensor and their neighbor sensors to develop an efficient dynamic threshold based Byzantine node identification method. After migrating Byzantine sensors, the DFC utilizes sensor-aware and preprocessed marine data of the beacon or honest sensors to complete target localization and trajectory tracking. Specifically, NMTLAT consists of a novel distributed and cooperative multi-target localization and tracking algorithm using both received signal strength indication (RSSI) and priori information of sensors location. NMTLAT employs the importance sampling method to approximate the posterior probability distribution of the sensors and targets location. Furthermore, when the marine target is outside MSR-WSNs coverage, a piecewise function is utilized to characterize the likelihood of finding a drowning target in the search and rescue sea area. Finally, the Lyapunov’s second stability theorem is adopted to measure the stability of the NMTLAT. Our extensive simulation experiments validate that the NMTLAT performance is superior to existing solutions in various marine search and rescue scenarios.","Importance sampling,Lyapunov’s stability theorem,Information entropy,Maritime search and rescue wireless sensor networks,Cooperative localization and tracking,Byzantine sensor identification,"
"similarity grouping-guided neural network modeling for maritime time series prediction","2019","Reliable and accurate prediction of time series plays a crucial role in the maritime industry, such as economic investment, transportation planning, port planning, design, and so on. The dynamic growth of maritime time series has the predominantly complex, and nonlinear and non-stationary properties. To guarantee high-quality prediction performance, we propose to first adopt the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and ensemble EMD (EEMD) methods to decompose the original time series into high- and low-frequency components. The low-frequency components can be easily predicted directly through traditional neural network (NN) methods. It is more difficult to predict high-frequency components due to their properties of weak mathematical regularity. To take advantage of the inherent self-similarities within high-frequency components, these components will be divided into several continuous small (overlapping) segments. The grouped segments with high similarities are then selected to form more proper training datasets for traditional NN methods. This regrouping strategy can assist in enhancing the prediction accuracy of high-frequency components. The final prediction result is obtained by integrating the predicted high- and low-frequency components. Our proposed three-step prediction frameworks benefit from the time series decomposition and similar segments grouping. The experiments on both port cargo throughput and vessel traffic flow have illustrated its superior performance in terms of prediction accuracy and robustness.","predicted high- frequency components,Transportation,Data prediction,time series decomposition,high-frequency components,nonstationary properties,Planning,reliable prediction,Predictive models,original time series,dynamic time warping (DTW),neural nets,low-frequency components,high-quality prediction performance,marine engineering,Artificial neural networks,similar segments grouping,Time series analysis,similarity grouping,similarity grouping-guided neural network modeling,three-step prediction frameworks,empirical mode decomposition (EMD),time series,Training,prediction accuracy,NN methods,maritime industry,maritime time series prediction,neural network,neural network methods,EMD methods,"
"gulf of cadiz zooplankton: community structure, zonation and temporal variation","2020","This study provides the first comprehensive description of the Gulf of Cadiz (SW Spain) marine zooplankton community. To do this we compiled information from a number of surveys and monitoring programs carried out in the area over the last 14 years. Using this time-series of quarterly (3 times per year) resolution, we describe their general composition, spatio-temporal variability and relationship with environmental factors. Zooplankton is dominated by copepods (mainly Clausocalanus, Paracalanus, Oncaea and Oithona), except in warm periods, when outbreaks of cladocerans (mainly Penilia avirostris but also Podon intermedius and Pleopis polyphemoides) outnumber copepods, accounting for more than 80% of total abundance on occasion. Zooplankton diversity was found to be higher in deeper waters while the density of most taxa (but not their abundance) decreased towards the ocean. On top of this general coast-ocean pattern a north–south gradient could also be distinguished resulting in three distinct zones. In relation to environmental structuring, mesoscale processes, sea surface temperature, winds, river runoff and primary productivity were identified as main factors shaping this zonation. Overall, zooplankton abundance showed a decreasing trend during the study period (2001–2015), caused by a drop of summer abundances, that was mainly driven by cladocerans.","Cladocerans,Diversity,Gulf of Cadiz,Abundance,Spatial and seasonal variability,Community composition,Guadalquivir,Copepods,"

"on some cognitive processing for airborne maritime radar","2017","This paper deals with the issue of detection tasks optimization in the case of airborne radar for maritime surveillance mission thanks to cognitive mechanisms, more precisely thanks to the learning of the radar environment (clutter). The proposed algorithm aims at selecting the most appropriate radar mode, if applicable the most appropriate platform altitude and horizontal position by analyzing the sea clutter. The analysis of the environment and then the inference of a more favorable mode of operation are based on the adjustment of the measurements to environment models, in particular clutter models. Another way to improve detection performance is the introduction of external knowledge in processing (Knowledge-Aided processing). An example of constant false alarm rate processing using external information for improving detection near the coasts is presented at the end of this paper.","airborne radar,constant false alarm rate processing,marine radar,radar detection,radar clutter,cognitive processing,platform altitude position,airborne maritime radar,Atmospheric modeling,horizontal position,detection tasks optimization,Shape,knowledge-aided processing,radar environment,Radar cross-sections,Radar clutter,maritime surveillance mission,Airborne radar,Clutter,environment models,sea clutter analysis,"
"big data and industrial internet of things for the maritime industry in northwestern norway","2015","Big Data Analytics (BDA) and Internet of Things (IoT) are rising quickly. The recent emerging Industrial IoT (IIoT), a sub-paradigm of IoT, focuses more in safety-critical industrial applications.

"context-based models to overcome operational challenges in maritime security","2015","Piracy and smuggling are major international problems which not only threaten maritime security but also affect the global economy. Even though NATO and international forces have been relentlessly fighting maritime crime in East Africa (Gulf of Aden), the problems still persist and maritime crime has moved to West Africa (Gulf of Guinea). In the same vein, the Joint Interagency Task Force-South (JIATF-S) has had substantial operational success, controlling the vast geographical spread of smugglers in the East Pacific and Caribbean Sea. Due to limited number of maritime assets available, every resource needs to be efficiently allocated, both in time and space. This poses a great operational challenge requiring the integration and fusion of disparate information relevant to the mission and dynamic allocation of resources under uncertainty. Operational planning and execution for counter-smuggling and counter-piracy operations involve surveillance (to search, detect, track and identify potential threats) and interdiction operations (to intercept, investigate and potentially apprehend the suspects) in a dynamic and uncertain mission environment. In this paper, we present context-based models for counter-smuggling and counter-piracy missions, where the smuggling and piracy activities are represented in the form of color coded heat maps built using Intelligence information (INTEL), meteorological and oceanographic (METOC) information and other mission-specific attributes (sensor observations, target types and their behavior, etc.); these maps are interpreted as probability of activity (PoA) surfaces. These PoA surfaces form an input to the decision support module discussed in this paper.","surveillance,METOC,Gulf of Guinea,East Pacific,Maritime Security,counter-piracy missions,counter-smuggling missions,Marine vehicles,probability of activity surfaces,context-based models,Planning,Resource management,operational planning,maritime security,Gulf of Aden,METOC information,Joint Interagency Task Force-South,decision support module,marine systems,meteorological and oceanographic information,Caribbean Sea,color coded heat maps,West Africa,Sea surface,piracy,NATO,PoA surfaces,dynamic resource allocation,Intelligence information,maritime crime,East Africa,smuggling,JIATF-S,national security,CONOPS,Surveillance,Security,INTEL,Radiation detectors,"
"a remote sensing and gis based investigation of a boreal forest coal fire","2011","A coal seam fire in interior Alaska was suspected to have started the Rex Creek forest fire in the summer of 2009. With prevailing winds, the forest fire spread rapidly to the north and within eleven days it burned about 410km2 of boreal forest. Coal seam fires can go unnoticed and unreported when present in remote and inaccessible areas. However, they still pose a serious threat to the surroundings. We used summer-time thermal infrared images from 1999 through 2009 acquired by the Landsat satellite and, through the process of image stacking, identified a region where the surface persistently showed temperatures 5°C to 14°C higher than the background areas. Field validation confirmed that this thermal anomaly area corresponds to a previously undocumented shallow coal seam fire. Superimposing the boundary of the Rex Creek forest fire revealed that the coal seam fire was at the southern end of the burn area where the forest fire originated. Plotting the location of all lightning strikes during this period helped to rule out lightning as the cause of the forest fire. Coal fires and forest fires can have a complex and dynamic relationship, one being the possible cause of the other. A thorough inventory of all past and present known coal seam fire locations can help to update forest fire hazard maps. A detailed map of shallow coal seam areas can help to prioritize fire fighting operations in order to avoid the chance of starting a new coal seam fire.","Forest fire,Remote sensing,Boreal forest,Coal fire,GIS,"
"restoration of maritime navigation systems in central american ports","1999","Summary form only given, as follows. This paper describes a project to reinstate maritime navigation in Central American (CA) ports that were devastated by the hurricane that occurred in November 1998. The project objectives were to install navigation facilities rapidly, and to use advanced technologies in the renovation to insure that the capabilities of the new systems would exceed those which existed before the hurricane. The damage to the ports and their installations and facilities was severe; but the ruination of their navigation systems also had far reaching effects. U.S. Secretary of Transportation, Rodney E. Slater, initiated a program to reconstruct the maritime navigation infrastructure in Central American ports. The Research and Special Programs Administration of the US/DOT, with technical support from the Volpe Center, was given the lead role in the CA Navigation Systems Revivification project. Working with the CA Commission of Maritime Transportation (COCATRAM), damage assessment was performed and a relief priority list was drawn up. The ports of Cortez and San Lorenzo in Honduras were hardest hit by the hurricane and consequently they were designated for the first replacements. The execution of the project required demanding logistics and acquisition planning that is detailed in the paper. It was decided to optimize the use of satellite technology where possible rather than revert only to the use of conventional aids to navigation. The Center for Navigation at the Volpe Center, capitalized on experience gained in navigation development projects for the Panama Canal and the Saint Lawrence Seaway to design and implement navigation and buoy positioning systems in CA. The differential Global Positioning Satellite system was selected as the primary signal source in order to provide highly accurate navigation in ports recovering from the hurricane.","Satellite navigation systems,damage assessment,Cortez,hurricane,Commission of Maritime Transportation,Marine vehicles,differential Global Positioning Satellite system,Global Positioning System,relief,Signal design,acquisition planning,Turning,ships,logistics,Central America ports,US Department of Transportation,Project management,San Lorenzo,Honduras,maritime navigation systems,Logistics,Hurricanes,Research and Special Programs Administration,navigation infrastructure,Irrigation,CA Navigation Systems Revivification project,"
"an intelligent maritime workplace using it technologies","2008","IT technologies over the past years have shown a rapid growth, on the contrary this increase of e-commerce and e-work in the maritime industry is not as intense as in any other field. E-commerce and e-work is still at its embryonic stages, however, the annual rate of increase suggest that in very few years this share will have grown dramatically. Thus, it is time to get prepared. The aim of the present paper is to present a new maritime intelligent workplace based weather information system and decision support for high-speed maritime transport. It has been achieved by linking fixed/mobile communications with navigation/positioning, efficient transmission and delivery over the geo-information network. These services will allow the shipmaster to have seamless access to, and interaction with intelligent, customised (route based) rich content multimedia information on the efficient and safe navigation passage for passengers, freights and the environment both on board ship and inland.","intelligent maritime workplace,Maritime,IT technologies,e-commerce,safe navigation passage,electronic commerce,geo-information network,navigation,e-work,multimedia systems,marine systems,content multimedia information,"
"background modeling combined with multiple features in the fourier domain for maritime infrared target detection","2022","To detect ship targets in dynamic sea backgrounds, a robust foreground detection method based on background modeling combined with multiple features in the Fourier domain (BMMFF) is proposed. Because the fluctuation of seawater is similar to a sine wave, the amplitude spectrum of the seawater in the Fourier domain has strong energy concentration, and the background model is built in the Fourier domain. The local statistical characteristics can effectively reflect the properties of a specific position, and the target frequency points are extracted by comparing the local statistical characteristic differences between the amplitude spectrum of the test frame and the updated background. Additionally, two different strategies are used to update the background for cases with or without sudden waves in two adjacent test frames. When the target and seawater have different contrast in different scenes, the threshold is set according to the seawaterâ€™s fluctuation degree, which is classified into three different levels in the training stage. Moreover, the linear correlation feature between the test frame and the updated background and the oscillation feature of the test frameâ€™s amplitude spectrum are proposed in the Fourier domain, which can better segment targets in relatively calm and violent sea scenes, respectively. Thus, the two features are combined with the background model with a reasonable strategy to further improve the detection accuracy. The experimental results demonstrate that BMMFF outperforms related comparison algorithms in different challenging sea scenes. The average false alarm rate of BMMFF is reduced by approximately 30% in the case where its average detection rate is similar to that of other algorithms.","target frequency points,linear correlation feature,Marine vehicles,Feature extraction,seawater,sea scenes,statistical analysis,dynamic sea backgrounds,ships,marine engineering,background modeling,object detection,ship targets,Oscillators,feature extraction,Correlation,Adaptation models,foreground detection method,infrared imaging,Dual-mode sea background model,local statistical characteristic differences,Object detection,image segmentation,Data mining,oscillation feature,Fourier domain,maritime infrared target detection,"
"an intelligent decision algorithm for the generation of maritime search and rescue emergency response plans","2019","Maritime search and rescue (SAR) decisions are the most important part of maritime SAR operations. In the process of making maritime SAR decisions, a key factor affecting efficiency and success rate is how to quickly respond to accidents and develop an emergency response plan. At present, maritime SAR emergency response plans are still mostly obtained through a combination of drift prediction models and SAR experience. There is a lack of SAR resource scheduling and SAR task assignment. The primary purpose of this paper is to explore the possibility of using an intelligent decision-making algorithm to formulate maritime SAR emergency response plans so as to produce results more scientifically. First, the relevant research areas and research data are briefly introduced, and the main mathematical models involved in the optimal search theory are expounded. Next, key technologies involved in the process of maritime SAR emergency response plan generation, including the determination of search area, the scheduling of SAR resources, the allocation of search tasks, and the planning of search routes, are analyzed in detail. Two optimization model algorithms, namely the SAR resource scheduling model based on genetic simulated annealing algorithm (GSAA) and the regional task allocation algorithm based on space-time characteristics, are proposed as approaches to solving the problem of resource scheduling and task allocation. Finally, the effectiveness and optimization of the proposed algorithms are verified by analyzing the emergency response of a real case which occurred in the Bohai Sea and comparing the different schemes. Through the algorithm proposed in this paper, the efficiency of maritime SAR operations can be effectively improved and the loss of life and property can be reduced.","planning,marine accidents,emergency management,maritime SAR decision making,intelligent decision-making algorithm,Prediction algorithms,SAR experience,Marine vehicles,maritime SAR emergency response plan generation,Resource management,intelligent decision algorithm,scheduling,genetic simulated annealing algorithm,genetic algorithms,task allocation,resources scheduling,drift prediction models,marine safety,Bohai Sea,SAR resource scheduling model,GSAA,mathematical models,Maritime SAR,space-time characteristics,search tasks,simulated annealing,decision making,SAR task assignment,Optimization,search problems,Trajectory,optimization model algorithms,optimization,regional task allocation algorithm,Scheduling,Task analysis,maritime search and rescue emergency response plan generation,search routes,optimal search theory,"
"robust cellular communications for unmanned aerial vehicles in maritime search and rescue","2019","Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) are a promising technology for fast, large scale survey operations such as maritime search and rescue (SAR). However, providing reliable communications over long distances remains a challenge. Cellular technology such as Long Term Evolution (LTE) is designed to perform well in the presence of fast-moving clients and highly dynamic channel conditions. Yet, its generic medium access mechanisms make it hard to support low-latency uplink traffic, which is needed for real-time command and control and similar applications. In this paper, we introduce an unmanned aerial system for maritime SAR, supported via an LTE data link. To mitigate drawbacks in uplink channel access, we develop a resource-guaranteed scheme based on persistent scheduling, using an open-source LTE stack. The approach is evaluated with a laboratory setup using software-defined radio modules. Measurements are taken on the application layer, using realworld telemetry data generated by an autopilot system in the presence of high bandwidth background traffic. Evaluations demonstrate that our system fulfills UAV requirements in terms of latency and reliability. Latency is further reduced to 6 ms on average and a 99.9th percentile of 10 ms by application-aware overprovisioning for mission-critical traffic and users.","unmanned aerial vehicles,telecommunication network reliability,robust cellular communications,medium access mechanisms,software-defined radio modules,autopilot system,emergency management,uplink channel access,Delays,Resource management,Reliability,maritime SAR,maritime search and rescue,high bandwidth background traffic,open-source LTE stack,real-time command and control,telecommunication scheduling,synchronisation,cellular technology,Uplink,cellular radio,LTE data link,aircraft communication,aircraft control,highly dynamic channel conditions,maritime search,low-latency uplink traffic,unmanned aerial system,command and control systems,autonomous aerial vehicles,telecommunication traffic,software radio,Unmanned aerial vehicles,Long Term Evolution,Base stations,resource allocation,"
"a novel ship collision risk evaluation algorithm based on the maximum interval of two ship domains and the violation degree of two ship domains","2022","In the research of ship collision avoidance, the evaluation of ship collision risk is an important part to determine whether there is a potential collision risk. In the field of ship collision avoidance, using an appropriate method to calculate the ship collision risk has always been a hot topic. To address the issues that only qualitative evaluation using the ship domain and the distance to the closest point of approach (DCPA) does not reflect the true distance between the two ships when the closest point of approach (CPA) parameters are used, a novel ship collision risk evaluation model is proposed. (1) A fuzzy quaternion ship domain (FQSD) model is established for the own ship (OS) and the target ship (TS) at the same time. (2) The two parameters the maximum interval of two ship domains (MISD) and the violation degree of two ship domains (VDSD) are introduced, which are solved based on Support Vector Machine for Classification (SVC) and geometric methods, respectively, and the ship collision probability model is established based on these two parameters. (3) Based on the momentum conservation theorem, considering the mass ratio of two ships, ship type, collision velocity and the location of the collision damage, the consequences of ship collision are calculated. (4) Based on the ship collision probability and ship collision consequences, a ship collision risk evaluation model is proposed. The simulation verification is performed under the three encounter situations of head-on, crossing, and overtaking, based on Maneuvering Model Group using the basic ship parameters of Dalian Maritime University's teaching-training ships “YUKUN” and “YUUPENG” to establish the model proposed in this paper. Simultaneously, it is compared to the ship collision risk evaluation method based on ship domain, CPA parameters, and spatial collision risk model. The simulation results demonstrate the superiority and efficacy of the ship collision risk evaluation algorithm proposed in this paper, which is an effective method for assessing ship collision risk.","Maneuvering model group,Ship domain,Collision risk evaluation,Ship collision avoidance,Support vector machine for classification,"
"the regional protocol for local communications among maritime autonomous surface ships based on vdes","2023","In order to provide more collision avoidance information to ships that may encounter each other in dense sea areas, prevent collision events, and minimize channel data pressure, ensure network reliability and reduce latency, this paper proposes a regional protocol for local communications among maritime autonomous surface ships based on VDES (High Frequency Data Exchange System). Based on the theoretical foundation of the ship domain model in the field of ships, the area where collision danger exists is found by guiding the ship domain model, and this area is used as the routing flood area, and the routing request is limited to this area. The improved AODV (Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector) routing forwarding algorithm is used to establish a communication link between ships in the routing request area using real-time location information. This can exchange more information with ships located in the collision risk area to assist in collaborative obstacle avoidance and prevent accidents. At the same time, it effectively avoids network-wide routing flooding, avoids network congestion, and ensures network stability. Simulation analysis shows that this protocol is superior to AIS in terms of delivery rate and delay on the basis of realizing business functions. This will be beneficial for obstacle avoidance between encountering ships.","channel data pressure,maritime autonomous surface ships,Marine vehicles,Delays,marine navigation,AODV routing protocol,regional protocol,communication link,routing protocols,high frequency data exchange system,ship field model,collision danger,collision risk area,Routing protocols,ships,marine safety,Stability criteria,collision avoidance information,network-wide routing flooding,telecommunication congestion control,mobile radio,Sea surface,routing request area,Collaboration,collaborative obstacle avoidance,collision events,dense sea areas,routing flood area,encountering ships,Routing,mobile robots,real-time location information,collision avoidance,ship domain model,VDES,local communications,network reliability,regional routing protocol,"
"a sensitivity quantification approach to significance analysis of thrusters in dynamic positioning operations","2021","The safety of offshore operations is highly dependent on the dynamic positioning (DP) capability of a vessel. Meanwhile, DP capability comes down to the ability of the thrust generated by thrusters to counteract environmental forces. Therefore, it is significant to investigate which thrusters are important to the position-keeping ability of vessels. However, complex environmental factors make the investigation of thrusters' importance more complicated. Hence, this paper proposes a new method to identify the influence of each thruster on vessel's station-keeping capability in different sea states. The station-keeping capability is quantified by a defined synthesized positioning ability criterion comprised by vessel position, heading angle, and consumed power. Through the comparison of different machine learning approaches, support vector machine (SVM) is used for building a surrogate model between DP capability and thrusters. In order to determine the most sensitive thruster in the whole process of vessel operation, an improved sensitivity analysis (SA) called ‘PAWN’ is employed along with statistical analysis to evaluate the significance of thrusters from different perspectives. Seventeen cases are investigated with respect to different thruster failures in various sea states. The results show the proposed method is able to identify the significance of each thruster in different scenarios.","Statistical analysis,Sensitivity analysis,Dynamic positioning capability,Thruster failures,"
"societal need for improved understanding of climate change, anthropogenic impacts, and geo-hazard warning drive development of ocean observatories in european seas","2011","Society’s needs for a network of in situ ocean observing systems cross many areas of earth and marine science. Here we review the science themes that benefit from data supplied from ocean observatories. Understanding from existing studies is fragmented to the extent that it lacks the coherent long-term monitoring needed to address questions at the scales essential to understand climate change and improve geo-hazard early warning. Data sets from the deep sea are particularly rare with long-term data available from only a few locations worldwide. These science areas have impacts on societal health and well-being and our awareness of ocean function in a shifting climate. Substantial efforts are underway to realise a network of open-ocean observatories around European Seas that will operate over multiple decades. Some systems are already collecting high-resolution data from surface, water column, seafloor, and sub-seafloor sensors linked to shore by satellite or cable connection in real or near-real time, along with samples and other data collected in a delayed mode. We expect that such observatories will contribute to answering major ocean science questions including: How can monitoring of factors such as seismic activity, pore fluid chemistry and pressure, and gas hydrate stability improve seismic, slope failure, and tsunami warning? What aspects of physical oceanography, biogeochemical cycling, and ecosystems will be most sensitive to climatic and anthropogenic change? What are natural versus anthropogenic changes? Most fundamentally, how are marine processes that occur at differing scales related? The development of ocean observatories provides a substantial opportunity for ocean science to evolve in Europe. Here we also describe some basic attributes of network design. Observatory networks provide the means to coordinate and integrate the collection of standardised data capable of bridging measurement scales across a dispersed area in European Seas adding needed certainty to estimates of future oceanic conditions. Observatory data can be analysed along with other data such as those from satellites, drifting floats, autonomous underwater vehicles, model analysis, and the known distribution and abundances of marine fauna in order to address some of the questions posed above. Standardised methods for information management are also becoming established to ensure better accessibility and traceability of these data sets and ultimately to increase their use for societal benefit. The connection of ocean observatory effort into larger frameworks including the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) and the Global Monitoring of Environment and Security (GMES) is integral to its success. It is in a greater integrated framework that the full potential of the component systems will be realised.",""
"use of the automatic identification system (ais) on autonomous weather buoys for maritime domain awareness applications","2006","The United States Coast Guard (USCG), as part of the Department of Homeland Security, is responsible for a wide variety of missions in the maritime domain. In order to support the accomplishment of these missions, the USCG needs to collect as much information as possible on activities occurring in the maritime domain. A large part of maritime activity relates to the movement of vessels. Therefore, detection, classification, identification and monitoring of vessels are a key component of what is known as Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA). The Automatic Identification System (AIS) is a technology that is used primarily as a tool for maritime safety, including vessel collision avoidance and as a means for coastal nations' Vessel Traffic Services (VTSs) to get information on vessels operating near their coasts. AIS equipment aboard vessels continuously and autonomously transmits information about the vessel including its identity, position, course, and speed to enhance safety. These transmissions can be received by other vessels or by land-based stations equipped with AIS receivers. The USCG sees the capability AIS provides, particularly for vessel tracking, as a major contributor to MDA and VTS. To extend the capability of USCG land-based AIS monitoring stations further offshore, the USCG Maritime Domain Awareness Program Integration Office sponsored the development of a near real-time, autonomous automatic identification and telemetry system based on AIS technology for installation on National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) weather buoys through the National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) and its technical support contractor, Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC).","Satellites,prototype system,satellite telemetry,Monitoring,geosynchronous satellite transmission system,Transmitters,satellite transmitter,AD 2005 03 to 2005 06,autonomous weather buoys,Assembly systems,oceanographic equipment,Relays,AIS-equipped vessel detection,Automatic Identification System,Cape Cod,Maritime Domain Awareness applications,MDA,Prototypes,Charleston,Strait of Juan de Fuca,offshore installations,Telemetry,real-time relay,Real time systems,USCG,South Carolina,national security,meteorology,AIS receiver,NDBC Data Assembly Center,NDAC,Massachusetts,marine vehicles,collision avoidance,System testing,Embedded system,San Francisco Harbor,"
"location-aware dynamic beam scheduling for maritime communication systems","2018","Currently, LTE cellular systems provide an excellent solution to broadband multimedia data transmission on intensive coverage area.

In this paper, a location-aware communication system is proposed. As an important part of this system, a novel beam scheduling algorithm is proposed to reach a compromise between throughput and user fairness. The algorithm combines proportional fair scheduling algorithm and the scheduling of beams, and get a good balance of fairness and efficiency.

"enhanced loran: real-time maritime trials","2008","Enhanced Loran (eLoran) is rapidly emerging as the primary GNSS backup for the new, global, maritime e- Navigation concept. Europe was ready to turn off all the Loran transmitters at the end of 2005. However, an increased understanding of GNSS vulnerability and a growing appreciation of eLoran's role within e-Navigation has resulted not only in a kiss-of-life for all the transmitters but also in the placing of a 15-year contract for a new Loran station at Anthorn in the United Kingdom. This has been accompanied by the establishment of a new, European eLoran Forum for service providers, real-time differential Loran trials and the funding of doctoral students for fundamental research into eLoran operational concepts. This paper will start by reviewing the motivation for eLoran in the European environment before describing the current status of the Anthorn status as part of the European Loran network.

"psr-based feature adaptation with anomaly re-prediction for maritime target tracking","2022","The tracking method for the relevant filter cannot track when the target is affected by the background and in the scene of occlusion. We propose a target tracking algorithm based on the peak-to-sidelobe ratio (PSR) feature weight adaptation with anomaly re-detection based on the efficient convolution operator for manual features (ECO_HC) algorithm. The weights of the HOG features and CN features corresponding to the peak-to-sidelobe ratio are used as dynamic weight coefficients, and the maximum response value after their fusion is the area where the target may appear. Determine the target tracking status by calculating the tracking confidence of the response map, and when there is a tracking anomaly, the ECO_HC tracker is enhanced using the Kalman filter to re-predict the target position. The proposed algorithm has experimented on the OTB-50 dataset. The results show that our algorithm can cope with complex scenarios and improves by 3.0% in tracking accuracy and 2.8% in tracking success rate compared with the baseline algorithm ECO_HC.

"geographical aodv protocol for multi-hop maritime communications","2013","Route request (RREQ) message is flooded to find a route in ad-hoc on-demand distance vector (AODV) routing protocol. This flooding of RREQ generates severe overheads in a maritime multi-hop ad-hoc network (MMANet) due to limited small bandwidth. In this paper, to improve the throughput of bandwidth-limited MMANet, we propose a geographical AODV (GAODV) protocol. The key feature of the GAODV is the selective broadcast of RREQ using position information. The routing overhead-traffic of the GAODV is smaller than that of AODV. This routing overhead-traffic reduction of the GAODV is more increased as the density of ship increases.","Satellites,routing protocols,RREQ message,marine communication,ad hoc networks,ad-hoc on-demand distance vector routing protocol,MMANet,geographical AODV protocol,route request message,maritime multihop ad-hoc network,GAODV protocol,multihop maritime communication,selective broadcast,telecommunication traffic,routing overhead-traffic reduction,AODV routing protocol,"
"multi-radar multi-target tracking algorithm for maritime surveillance at oth distances","2016","The aim of this paper is to propose, develop and test multi-radar multi-target tracking algorithm for maritime surveillance at over-the-horizon (OTH) distances. The proposed algorithm utilizes a weighted pure minimum mean square error (MMSE) algorithm for multi-radar data fusion and adaptive alpha â€” beta tracking algorithm for target tracking. The developed data fusion algorithm calculates the weighted center of mass of all targets observed by OTH radars (OTHRs) within a gate radius of predicted position, and uses it for a track update process. During the process a weighting factor which will be used in an adaptive alpha-beta tracking algorithm is derived. The weighting factor as well as alpha and beta factors are updated in each observation period and depend on all targets, which have fallen into a gate radius during the track update process. The algorithm is designed, implemented, and tested in an environment consisting of a simulated network of two OTHRs with significantly overlapping surveillance areas.","weighted pure minimum mean square error algorithm,sensor fusion,marine radar,adaptive alpha-beta tracking algorithm,Prediction algorithms,multiradar data fusion algorithm,data fusion,target tracking,marine systems,over-the-horizon distance,maritime surveillance,Target tracking,OTH distance,MMSE algorithm,least mean squares methods,search radar,Radar tracking,multiradar multitarget tracking algorithm,Radar,HF radar,Data integration,radar tracking,OTHR,OTH radar,Surveillance,"
"a search strategy and vessel detection in maritime environment using fixed-wing uavs","2023","In this paper, we address the problem of autonomous search and vessel detection in an unknown GNSS-denied maritime environment with fixed-wing UAVs. The main challenge in such environments with limited localization, communication range, and the total number of UAVs and sensors is to implement an appropriate search strategy so that a target vessel can be detected as soon as possible. Thus we present informed and non-informed methods used to search the environment. The informed method relies on an obtained probabilistic map, while the non-informed method navigates the UAVs along predefined paths computed with respect to the environment. The vessel detection method is trained on synthetic data collected in the simulator with data annotation tools. Comparative experiments in simulation have shown that our combination of sensors, search methods and a vessel detection algorithm leads to a successful search for the target vessel in such challenging environments.","detection,target vessel,fixed-wing UAVs,unknown GNSS-denied maritime environment,Location awareness,MBZIRC,informed method,marine environment,Search problems,autonomous search,search methods,appropriate search strategy,satellite navigation,vessel detection method,noninformed method,Probabilistic logic,simulation,Annotations,autonomous aerial vehicles,search strategy,search problems,communication range,mobile robots,successful search,vessel detection algorithm,Computational modeling,Sensors,Navigation,fixed-wing UAV,"

"experimental comparison of ad hoc methods for classification of maritime vessels based on real-life ais data","2018","Classification of Maritime Vessels is a recurrent task in maritime surveillance systems. Classification can be conducted by different methods, e.g., NaÃ¯ve Bayes, k Nearest Neighbor, Decision Tree, Fuzzy Rule, or Neural Networks. The Automatic Identification System (AIS) is cooperative system of VHF-radio data exchange. By broadcasting of navigational data and ships' information it supports maritime safety, surveillance, and information. Based on measured AIS datasets of five maritime hotspots, easily implementable standard classification (i.e. ad hoc) methods from Data Science are compared to each other. These are evaluated in terms of accuracy. This experimental evaluation is motivated by the following question: Tip to which degree properties and behavior, e.g., vessel's type, can be detected by using large quantities of ship's positional, motion, and dimensions' data as provided by AIS?

"maritime opportunistic transmission: when and how much can dtn node deliver?","2019","Maritime wireless communication delay tolerant networks (MWDTN) may develop slowly, if there is no efficient scheme to allocate network resources which are arrival data and limited energy.

In addition, we assume the node of delay tolerant networks (DTN) only uses green energy absorbed from the sun and wind. We establish a reasonable harvest-and-consumption energy model. Considering to make a delay-energy tradeoff, an optimization algorithm based on Lyapunov optimization (LO), which makes the transmission determination for waking-up the DTN node and determines the optimal data quantity should be transmitted for current system state, is proposed to cope with the delay-energy tradeoff problem.

"a generic anomaly detection approach applied to mixture-of-unigrams and maritime surveillance data","2019","This paper proposes a new generic method to detect anomalies (i.e., statistical outliers) which can be used with a generative topic model. In this paper, we specify this method in the context of the Mixture-of-unigrams model, which is widely used in text mining. It is possible to detect anomalies with a topic model by applying a threshold to the likelihood. However, it is challenging to choose the threshold since the choice needs to consider both the similarities of the topics and the length of documents. This paper describes a new intuitive method to detect anomalies which simply manipulates the output of the trained model. Such an approach is anticipated to have parameters that are more intuitive to define for a given problem. To assess the utility of the proposed approach, we also present a use case involving identifying ships misreporting their ship-type using geo-location data from the Automatic Identification System (AIS) messages. We show that, if we train a model using data for one type of ship, it is possible to identify ships of another type as anomalous.","geo-location data,data mining,Anomaly detection,Mixture-of-unigrams model,Marine vehicles,natural language processing,security of data,trained model,generic anomaly detection,ships,automatic identification system,marine engineering,text mining,generative topic model,Training data,Data models,statistical outliers,intuitive method,Artificial intelligence,Training,text analysis,Probability,maritime surveillance data,learning (artificial intelligence),"
"density and mobility impact on manet routing protocols in a maritime environment","2015","Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks (MANETS) are multi hop wireless networks, where a packet hops through a number of intermediate nodes within coverage range of each other to reach the intended destination.

The high cost of other available technologies which require direct connection to IP networks make our approach an attractive proposition for small craft.

In the integrated network, satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) provide the users with edge computing services and network access.

"a preliminary study on an optical system for nautical and maritime traffic monitoring","2021","The nautical traffic is very difficult to monitor since many vessels are not cooperative. VTSs (Vessel Traffic Systems) use several sources of information for estimating shipsâ€™ Position Navigation and Velocity, such as AIS (Automatic Identification System) and RADAR (RAdio Detection And Ranging); nevertheless, VTS areas do not cover the entire costal area of a country. In many cases the classification and identification of small non-AIS vessels could provide an important to the safety of navigation.Indeed, especially during the summer, the nautical tourism has a great impact on the maritime traffic congestion. The issue involves many institutions such as Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) and local maritime authorities which are not able to monitor the high volume of nautical traffic. This work introduces an optical system designed to monitor the traffic in small coastal areas based on images acquired by a single camera. The reliability and accuracy of the system is conditioned by the size of the pixel on the sea surface (Ground Sample Distance-GSD) and by the camera footprint area as well. More in detail, this work focuses on the detection of the best camera placement on the coast for optimizing the GSD size and obtaining the shape of camera footprint.

"a novel approach to automate surrounding ships in a virtual maritime environment","2014","Full mission marine training scenarios are essential in training marine trainees with ship handling simulators. In a good training simulation not only the static environment but also the dynamic surrounding ships plays a major role in terms of behaviour realism. The surrounding ships also need to navigate according to COLREG (Convention on International Regulation for Preventing Collisions at Sea) navigational rules. This research presents a novel approach to automate the surrounding vessels in a marine simulation environment with a central controller to control the behaviours of each surrounding vessel in the marine environment. The controller uses positioning data of real ships which are derived from a set of historical Automatic Identification System (AIS) data and map the positioning data with the surrounding ships in virtual environment to obtain the navigation. An Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm is used to avoid the collisions by generating a new path when both trainee's ship and surrounding ships are in the vicinity of each other. The collision handling mechanism uses COLREG rules. The ACO algorithm generates successful collision avoided paths in all head-on, crossing and over-taking encountering situations. The number of turning points is used to measure the smoothness of the path and number of obstacles in the environment and number of nodes in the graph affects the smoothness of the path. With these results it is revealed that AIS data can be used as an assistant to automate surrounding vessels in a virtual maritime environment together with a proper collision avoidance mechanism.","head-on situations,collision handling mechanism,virtual maritime environment,ACO algorithm,crossing situations,virtual reality,ant colony optimization,target ships,ant colony optimisation,over-taking encountering situations,surrounding ships automation,marine navigation,Radio frequency,surrounding ships,ship handling simulators,ships,Automatic Identification System,AIS,surrounding vessels,Convention on International Regulation for Preventing Collisions at Sea,central controller,marine simulation environment,collision avoidance,Ant Colony Optimization (ACO),autonomous navigation,historical AIS data,COLREG navigational rules,"
"multi-armed bandits learning for task offloading in maritime edge intelligence networks","2022","In the context of complex and dynamic marine environment, the offloading of computing tasks for ships of Internet of Things (IoT) users is a very challenging problem considering the different quality of service (QoS) requirements of maritime applications. Mobile edge computing driven by powerful computing capability and edge intelligence is taken as a promising solution, especially for the resource-constrained and delay-sensitive maritime IoT users. In this paper, we study the optimal edge server selection problem for ship IoT users to jointly minimize the latency and energy consumption for task offloading. Specifically, we first propose a novel space-air-ground-edge (SAGE) integrated maritime network architecture to offload computation-intensive IoT services at sea. Then, the latency and energy consumption of data transmission and processing during offloading are modelled. Based on the models, the edge server selection problem is formulated into a Multi-Armed Bandits learning problem, with considering the task latency requirement and energy budget. To achieve the optimal solution, a novel algorithm, referred to as UCB1-ESSS, is developed, which links the latency, energy consumption, and network constraints by introducing both reward and cost. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve considerably lower offloading latency and weighted latency-energy cost compared with the traditional algorithms under different QoS requirements, which proves the efficacy of theproposed algorithm.","edge intelligence,multi-armed bandits,resource-constrained,dynamic marine environment,data transmission,Internet of Things,Energy consumption,quality of service,Marine vehicles,Delays,ship IoT users,maritime edge intelligence networks,task latency requirement,powerful computing capability,energy budget,Things users,Servers,marine ship IoT users,cloud computing,MultiArmed Bandits,latency-energy cost,optimisation,mobile computing,mobile edge computing,network constraints,Computing offloading,computation-intensive IoT services,considerably lower offloading latency,maritime applications,complex environment,task offloading,energy consumption,optimal edge server selection problem,delay-sensitive maritime IoT users,computational complexity,maritime wireless networks,Computational modeling,optimal solution,Task analysis,Internet,learning (artificial intelligence),resource allocation,service requirements,novel space-air-ground-edge integrated maritime network architecture,"

"development of an unmanned aerial system for maritime environmental observation","2021","We developed an octocopter-based unmanned aerial system (UAS) to monitor remote environments. The system contains various environmental monitoring sensors for measuring wind speed/direction, temperature, relative humidity, atmospheric pressure, fine dust, and multispectral and RGB data. The UAS consists of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), a ground control station, and a server. We studied its electrical, mechanical, and software (SW) configurations. Specifically, we developed hardware (HW) and SW to control the yaw and gimbal pitch directions of the UAV conveying multispectral and RGB cameras. To prevent the obtained solar reflectance from affecting the multispectral and RGB data and to improve the quality of the obtained data, we maneuvered the yaw so that it would always deviate 135Â° from the solar azimuth angle, with the sun at its rear. Managing the yaw direction involves controlling the UAV based on a micro air vehicle link message-based robot operating system (ROS). To safely test the UAS performance before the maiden flight in an ocean area, we first evaluated PX4 and ROS-based SW through indoor software-in-the-loop simulation (SILS) via the Gazebo tool. Subsequently, we used an F450 UAV and an actual maritime UAV to sequentially perform pre-flight and flight experiments.

"understanding global spatio-temporal trends and the relationship between vegetation greenness and climate factors by land cover during 1982–2014","2020","Analysis of the correlation between vegetation greenness and climate variable trends is important in the study of vegetation greenness. Our study used Normalized Difference Vegetation Index-3rd generation data from the Advanced Very High-Resolution Radiometer - Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies (AVHRR-GIMMS NDVI3g), land cover data from the Climate Change Initiative (CCI-LC), and climate data from the Climatic Research Unit global time series (CRU TS) of climate variables (temperature and precipitation, solar radiation) over the past 33 years. First, we estimated the overall trends for vegetation greenness and climate variables over five time periods. Second, we subjected the data to correlation, regression, and residual analyses to detect correlations between vegetation greenness and different climate variables. Third, we extracted trends and correlation results by primary land cover types for each climate zone. Our study was focused at the global scale, and findings indicate that the largest decreasing trend of vegetation greenness and grasslands occurred in the mid-latitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere and in parts of South America, Africa, Saudi Arabia, and south and northeast Asia. In particular, the cold climatic zones of forest (36.6%), cropland (36.6%), and grassland (14.1%) suffered significant decline in vegetation greenness. Anthropogenic activities are mainly responsible for declining vegetation greenness particularly in northern Africa, central and western Asia. However, residual analysis shows an increase in vegetation greenness in some parts of western Europe, southern Australia, and the northern part of South America. The study also identified temperature and precipitation as the main factors responsible for controlling vegetation growth. Hot-spot areas with the largest temperature increases were found in the Amazon, Central America, southern Greenland, east Africa, south-east Asia, and other areas. However, temperatures decreased in the western part of South America, Angola, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Papua New Guinea. Precipitation decreased the most from March to May over most parts of the world with high correlation (r = 0.88) in Russia Canada, northeast Asia, and central Africa. In general, climate factors were the principal drivers of the variation in vegetation greenness globally in recent years.","Vegetation greenness trends,Land cover,Correlation,Precipitation,Global,Temperature,"
"validation of ship intention model for maritime collision avoidance control using historical ais data","2023","This article tests the method for inferring and modeling ship intentions presented in [1] on real ship encounters gathered through the automatic identification system (AIS) that all larger ships are required to use. Empirical distributions on how early ships tend to perform avoidance maneuvers and how close they tend to come are evaluated. These are used by the intention model to identify when a shipâ€™s behavior is outside normal behavior. Running the intention model on the historical ship encounters demonstrates that the intention model is able to correctly infer the intentions of ships in real collision encounters. The model is able to distinguish between different types of incompliant behavior such as a ship not giving way when it should, the wrong ship giving way, or a ship giving way in the wrong direction.

"development and deployment of multi-mission intelligent autonomous maritime systems","2020","Cherokee Nation Strategic Programs (CNSP) and Ocean Aero, Inc. have teamed together to demonstrate the multi-mission capabilities of commercial autonomous maritime systems. CNSP has a proven record testing, fielding, and developing Unmanned Systems (UxS) programs across air, ground, and maritime domains. Ocean Aero has developed a portfolio of intelligent autonomous underwater and surface vehicles that are uniquely engineered for a wide range of applications above and below the ocean surface. The focus of our collaboration is the accelerated deployment of autonomous capabilities in operational mission scenarios. Unmanned systems are demonstrating daily value to commercial and civilian users today. Drones are rapidly moving beyond powerful remotely controlled information capture tools into advanced networks of aerial robots providing services and access that was never before considered valuable. Ground robot technologies are maturing just as rapidly and taking on many different forms as purpose-built systems are enabling subterranean exploration, driver safety on interstate highways, and disaster response support. Maritime systems are now fulfilling the same potential with robust, all-weather designs that enable long endurance, rugged missions for marine users. The operational value that these systems provide comes from the advancements in intelligent autonomy. We are currently testing the range of autonomous capabilities of the Ocean Aero Triton Series autonomous underwater and surface vehicle systems at the University of Southern Mississippi Marine Research Center (USM MRC). The Ocean Aero vehicles are designed and built with autonomous, persistent navigation capabilities as a standard feature. Additional customized, mission-centric sensors may be added to the systems to accomplish specific operational tasks and/or increase autonomous performance. The command-and-control (C2) communication architecture provides situational awareness and mission progress monitoring for the onboard vehicle decision-making, as well as the remote operator control station. To successfully achieve the high level of autonomous operations in locations without terrestrial communications (cellular) and beyond visual line of sight, UxS use satellite communications for navigation and mission data transfer. Our testing is evaluating the ability of the autonomous systems to accomplish multiple missions, including perimeter security, tracking of other surface vehicles, environmental monitoring, and marine science missions. These evaluations include the performance of the vehicles, the sensors, and the multi-domain communication systems, while characterizing the operating conditions for each test series. â€œAutonomyâ€ is a capability that means different things to different people. Our testing at the MRC is evaluating the ability of the system to react to new information, whether from external source or self-perceived, to accomplish the intended mission, such as detection of an unknown vehicle in the area. This ability to react includes concepts such as dynamic replanning for navigation, as well as communications with the operations center for mission management awareness. Through these communications and activities, we are measuring the operator workloads in multiple missions to determine if the autonomy in the system is increasing, decreasing, or improving operator performance. Our testing team was assembled specifically to accomplish these objectives. The full technical paper will include sample test cases and data collection examples for evaluating the Ocean Aero autonomous underwater and surface vehicle technologies using the Cherokee Nation Capabilities-Based Assessment process. This is the proven, repeatable process that we have used for evaluating air, ground, and maritime unmanned systems for many customers. We use this process for assessing the operational performance of mature products, not research-only test units. This focus on technologies that are commercially available or at least products from an active production line, allow us to evaluate capabilities as they relate to mission requirements and user objectives. We have the team with the experience, the equipment, the facilities, and the dedication to advance the expectations of what is possible for unmanned maritime systems.

"double-constrained rpca based on saliency maps for foreground detection in automated maritime surveillance","2015","The development of automated video-surveillance applications for maritime environment is a very difficult task due to the complexity of the scenes: moving water, waves, etc. The motion of the objects of interest (i.e. ships or boats) can be mixed with the dynamic behavior of the background (non-regular patterns). In this paper, a double-constrained Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA), named SCM-RPCA (Shape and Confidence Map-based RPCA), is proposed to improve the object foreground detection in maritime scenes. The sparse component is constrained by shape and confidence maps both extracted from spatial saliency maps.

"recursive optimal manoeuvring systems for maritime search and rescue mission","2004","The ideas of developing recursive optimal manoeuvring systems are based on the author's recent research results related to applications of the recursive estimation procedures and modern control theory in marine control systems. The manoeuvring is a trajectory tracking control system. The adopted method is combination of a recursive estimation procedure with an appropriate control law. In order to do the maritime search and rescue mission, the reference trajectory generated by the guidance system is computed based on the way-point, light-of-sight and exponential decay techniques and standard search patterns suggested by International Maritime Organization (IMO). The manoeuvring system has time-varying coefficients that are estimated by an online estimation identification procedure, and time-varying control gains determined by the optimal control law. Therefore, the manoeuvring system can adapt well to changes of environmental disturbances and do the tasks of maritime search and rescue mission at rough seas.","exponential decay technique,Vehicle dynamics,online estimation identification procedure,Marine vehicles,optimal control,Optimal control,environmental disturbance,time-varying coefficient/control gain,optimal control law,marine safety,Accidents,International Maritime Organization,position control,recursive optimal manoeuvring system,maritime search,recursive estimation procedure,way-point technique,standard search pattern,Australia,Recursive estimation,IMO,marine control system,Automatic control,light-of-sight technique,Control systems,Computational modeling,sea rescue mission,recursive estimation,tracking,trajectory tracking control/guidance system,Control theory,"
"a cloud based architecture capable of perceiving and predicting multiple vessel behaviour","2015","Progressively huge amounts of data, tracking vessels during their voyages across the seas, are becoming available, mostly due to the automatic identification system (AIS) that vessels of specific categories are required to carry. These datasets provide detailed insights into the patterns vessels follow, while safely navigating across the globe, under various conditions. In this paper, we develop an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) capable of predicting a vessels future behaviour (position, speed and course), based on events that occur in a predictable pattern, across large map areas. The main concept of this study is to determine if an ANN is capable of inferring the unique behavioural patterns that each vessel follows and successively use this as a means for predicting multiple vessel behaviour into a future point in time. We design, train and implement a proof of concept ANN, as a cloud based web application, with the ability of overlaying predicted short and long term vessel behaviour on an interactive map. Our proposed approach could potentially assist in busy port scheduling, vessel route planning, anomaly detection and increasing overall Maritime Domain Awareness.","Vessel behaviour prediction,Soft computing applications,Artificial Neural Network,Automated identification system,Maritime Domain Awareness,"

"gnss integrity concepts for maritime users","2019","Some of the most important parameters of operational requirements for Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) are integrity, continuity, accuracy, availability and coverage. These requirements, most strictly formalized in aviation, are based on risk analysis, considering risk exposure time and critical risk exposure time. However, the GNSS user requirements in maritime domain are still not clearly set. GNSS offers worldwide coverage at a sufficient position data quality and though other means of ship's position fixing are available at sea, the use of GNSS devices is generally the most preferred method of producing valid position data. Primary means for electronic position fixing currently in use in majority of merchant ships are shipborne autonomous GPS receivers or DGPS IALA receivers. More advanced GNSS receivers able to process signals from GPS, GLONASS, Chinese Beidou, European Galileo, regional Indian IRNSS, and satellite based augmentation systems (SBAS) are still rare. But it is expected that such combined or multi-system receivers will soon become more common in maritime transport.To be prepared for a malfunction of any GNSS devices for maritime applications and e-Navigation specifically, their state of the art integrity monitoring should be developed and standardized analogously to other transport domains. The issues of existing requirements, performance standards, and future concepts of maritime GNSS integrity are discussed in this paper.","satellite based augmentation systems,operational requirements,integrity monitoring,GNSS,Radio navigation,Receivers,Standards,electronic position fixing,e-Navigation,maritime GNSS integrity,Monitoring,integrity,Global Navigation Satellite System,PNT,Global navigation satellite system,marine navigation,Global Positioning System,maritime users,"
"a comprehensive maritime benchmark dataset for detection, tracking and threat recognition","2021","This paper describes a new multimodal maritime dataset recorded using a multispectral suite of sensors, including AIS, GPS, radar, and visible and thermal cameras. The visible and thermal cameras are mounted on the vessel itself and surveillance is performed around the vessel in order to protect it from piracy at sea. The dataset corresponds to a series of acted scenarios which simulate attacks to the vessel by small, fast-moving boats (â€˜skiffsâ€™). The scenarios are inspired by real piracy incidents at sea and present a range of technical challenges to the different stages in an automated surveillance system: object detection, object tracking, and event recognition (in this case, threats towards the vessel). The dataset can thus be employed for training and testing at several stages of a threat detection and classification system. We also present in this paper baseline results that can be used for benchmarking algorithms performing such tasks.

"bistatic sar maritime ship target 3-d image reconstruction method without distortion in local cartesian coordinate","2023","Bistatic synthetic aperture radar (BiSAR) has been attracting worldwide attention because of its forward-looking imaging and high anti-interference. In harsh environment, it is vital for BiSAR to conduct extensive surveillance, imaging, and recognition of maritime ship targets. However, under the disturbance of sea waves, the ship target has an unknown and massive 3-D rotation, so that its imaging projection plane (IPP) is also undetermined. Thus, high-dimensional random distortion appears in imaging results, making it difficult to recognize the target through 2-D distorted images effectively. To solve these problems, BiSAR maritime ship target 3-D image reconstruction method without distortion in local Cartesian coordinate (LCC) is proposed. In this article, according to positions of scatterers and rotation parameters, significant differences of different scatterers of maritime ship targets have been found in bistatic range, Doppler centroid (DC), and Doppler frequency rate (DFR), which lays a solid foundation for the scatterer separation of ship targets. On this basis, a 3-D R-DC-DFR domain is constructed, and 2-D echoes of the maritime ship target are projected into R-DC-DFR domain to separate scatterers. Then, by remapping data of transmitter and receiver in R-DC-DFR domain to LCC, as well as evaluating their similarity metric, the optimal rotation parameters of the ship target can be obtained via the maximal similarity. Therefore, the image distortion caused by the unknown IPP has been removed, and 3-D image reconstruction of ship targets can be realized without distortion in the LCC. Furthermore, to evaluate performances of 3-D image reconstruction for different rotation parameters and bistatic configurations, 3-D reconstruction index is proposed and analyzed. Both point-targets and maritime ship targets are simulated to emphasize the effectiveness of the proposed method.","local Cartesian coordinate,bistatic synthetic aperture radar (BiSAR),marine radar,R-DC-DFR domain,Image reconstruction,maritime ship target,Marine vehicles,bistatic SAR maritime ship target 3-D image reconstruction method,high-dimensional random distortion,Transmitters,Synthetic aperture radar,geophysical image processing,3-D reconstruction,ships,synthetic aperture radar,image distortion,image reconstruction,radar imaging,Doppler effect,BiSAR maritime ship target,2-D distorted images,imaging projection plane,Receivers,Imaging,point-targets,remote sensing by radar,local Cartesian coordinate (LCC),oceanographic techniques,"

"origin of harmattan dust settled in northern ghana — long transported or local dust?","2011","The Harmattan is a dry, dust-laden continental wind which has its origin in the Bodélé Depression in the Chad basin. In Ghana the Harmattan can be experienced from November to March, when the Harmattan replaces the dominant south westerly maritime Monsoon wind. The hypothesis of this study is that the majority of dust deposited in northern Ghana may not be from the original Harmattan source in the Bodélé Depression. The aim of this study is therefore to investigate the origin of deposited dust in Tamale, Ghana. This is examined by comparing wind data, grain size distribution, mineralogical and geochemical data from dust samples deposited during the Harmattan and Monsoon seasons, and topsoil. This study shows that despite a clear difference between the wind directions in the Harmattan and Monsoon seasons in Tamale, northern Ghana, no distinct differences are observed between the mineral or elemental compositions of the bulk dust samples. Traces of minerals in the clay fraction of the Harmattan period dust may have their origin in the Bodélé Depression or other saline environments. The Harmattan dust deposited in Ghana shows only little resemblance to dust from the Chad basin and with Harmattan dust deposited in Niger. This study therefore suggests that the dust deposited during the Harmattan period in northern Ghana is not under significant influence of sediments from the Bodélé Depression. Similarity in the mineral and elemental composition of the dust from both the Harmattan and Monsoon periods indicates that the dusts settled are mainly of local origin.","West Africa,Harmattan,Elemental composition,Mineralogy composition,Mineral dust,"

"augmented ship tracking under occlusion conditions from maritime surveillance videos","2020","Ship tracking provides crucial on-site microscopic kinematic traffic information which benefits maritime traffic flow analysis, ship safety enhancement, traffic control, etc., and thus has attracted considerable research attentions in the maritime surveillance community. Conventional ship tracking methods yield satisfied results by exploring distinct visual ship features in maritime images, which may fail when the target ship is partially or fully sheltered by obstacles (e.g., ships, waves, etc.) in maritime videos. To overcome the difficulty, we propose an augmented ship tracking framework via the kernelized correlation filter (KCF) and curve fitting algorithm. First, the KCF model is introduced to track ships in the consecutive maritime images and obtain raw ship trajectory dataset. Second, the data anomaly detection and rectification procedure are implemented to rectify the contaminated ship positions. For the purpose of performance evaluation, we implement the proposed framework and another three popular ship tracking models on the four typical ship occlusion videos. The experimental results show that our proposed framework successfully tracks ships in maritime video clips with high accuracy (i.e., the average root mean square error (RMSE), root mean square percentage error (RMSPE), mean absolute deviation (MAD) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) are less than 10), which significantly outperforms the other popular ship trackers.","Smart ship,maritime surveillance videos,Marine vehicles,Feature extraction,maritime traffic flow analysis,augmented ship tracking,ship trajectory dataset,on-site microscopic kinematic traffic information,visual ship features,Videos,kernelized correlation filter,object tracking,ships,marine safety,marine engineering,Target tracking,object detection,feature extraction,maritime images,Correlation,curve fitting algorithm,image filtering,video signal processing,Training,curve fitting,ship occlusion videos,data anomaly detection,Visualization,traffic control,ship occlusion,traffic engineering computing,ship safety enhancement,video surveillance,visual ship tracking,"

"hybrid satellite-uav-terrestrial maritime networks: network selection for users on a vessel optimized with transmit power and uav position","2022","The hybrid satellite-UAV-terrestrial maritime networks have shown great promise for broadband coverage at sea. The existing works focused on vessels collaboratively served by UAV-enabled aerial base station (ABSs) and terrestrial base stations (TBSs) deployed along the coast, and proved that data rate could be improved by optimizing transmit power and ABS's position. In practice, users on a vessel can be collaboratively served by an ABS and a vessel-enabled base station (VBS) in different networks. In this case, how to select the network for users on a vessel is still an open issue. In this paper, a TBS and a satellite respectively provide wireless backhaul for the ABS and the VBS. The network selection is jointly optimized with transmit power of ABS and VBS, and ABS's position for improving data rate of all users.

In order to find appropriate solutions, the maritime domain has to be studied having due regard to its particular difficulties and challenges.

With the increasing amount of data and information provided by such commercial systems, a layered approach for maritime picture compilation is proposed, at both unclassified and classified levels of maritime data. Huge amount of data in the unclassified level dictates utilization of modern software and data mining technologies to produce meaningful and useful information for the systems with higher classifications.

"smoke aerosol transport patterns over the maritime continent","2013","Smoke transport patterns over the Maritime Continent (MC) are studied through a combination of approaches, including a) analyzing AODs obtained from satellite products; b) aerosol transport modeling with AOD assimilation along with the atmospheric flow patterns; c) analyzing smoke wet deposition distributions; and d) examining forward trajectories for smoke events defined in this study. It is shown that smoke transport pathways are closely related to the low-level atmospheric flow, i.e., during June–Sept, smoke originating from the MC islands with a dominant source over central and southern Sumatra, and southern and western Borneo, is generally transported northwestward south of the equator and northeastward north of the equator with the cross-equatorial flow, to the South China Sea (SCS), the Philippines and even further to the western Pacific. During the October–November transitional period, smoke transport paths are more zonally oriented compared to June–September. Smoke originating from Java, Bali, Timor etc, and southern New Guinea, which are in the domain of easterlies and southeasterlies during the boreal summer (June–November), is generally transported westward. It is also found that smoke transport over the MC exhibits multi-scale variability. Smoke typically lives longer and can be transported farther in El Niño years and later MJO phases compared with non El Niño years and earlier MJO phases. During El Niño periods there is much stronger westward transport to the east tropical Indian Ocean. Finally, orographic effect on smoke transport over the MC is also clearly discernable.","Aerosol transport,Smoke,El Niño,MJO,Smoke transport,Maritime Continent,"
"multi-radio multi-channel assignment algorithm in maritime wireless mesh networks","2019","The recent growth in the maritime industry stemming to increase in global commerce as well as searching for hydrocarbons at offshore locations, the high data rate and cost affordable maritime communication is acquired. A mesh network is envisaged for maritime communications because of its expanded coverage, self-healing, and high-capacity. With the development of multi-radio technology, the frequency interference can be decreased sharply with proper channel assignment. The static channel assignment optimization is often applied to decrease the wireless frequency interference which is known as an NP-hard problem. In this paper, we focus on the static channel assignment issue and propose a heuristic algorithm to solve the optimization problem. The problem is addressed by assigning channels to communication links to minimize the interference from overall network. A modified particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is proposed to optimize the problem, and a new merging solution is adopted to reassign channels for nodes, which violate the radio constraints.

"routeminer: mining ship routes from a massive maritime trajectories","2014","Mining trajectory data has been attracting significant interest in the last years. By analyzing trajectory data, we are able to discover the movement behavior and location-aware knowledge, and then develop many interesting applications such as movement behavior discovery, location prediction, traffic analysis, and so on. However, trajectory data mining is a challenge task because of the trajectory data is available with uncertainty. Furthermore, discovering the valuable knowledge from maritime trajectory is made even more difficult due to the maritime area is a free moving space. Unlike the vehicles' movements are constrained by road networks, there is no such a sea route for ships to follow in maritime area. A ship's movement may not exactly repeat the same trajectory even the ship has the similar movement behavior with others. In this work, Route Miner system provides a framework of ship route mining for maritime traffic analysis. Given a set of ship trajectories in a maritime area, Route Miner explore the movement behavior from those massive trajectories in a free moving space. Then, ship routes are detected based on those behavioral pattern. Finally, the system generates a set of ships routes to provide operators a better understanding from ship trajectory data.

"maritime hacking using land-based skills","2022","Todayâ€™s maritime shipping traffic remains remarkably vulnerable to land cyberattacks due to corporate avoidance of expensive upgrades and maintenance, a lack of skill across the maritime shipping industry, critical maritime chokepoints as ambush locations, and an engrained tendency to view the sea as buffering shipping from land-based threats.

Though suspicions were unproven, the effects of the weeklong blockage were global, creating a security warning for national defense professionals. The lesson from the incident is clear â€“ the maritime industry is full of chokepoints that can be economically damaging if exploited. The event also offered a widely covered demonstration event for adversaries seeking future leverage in disruption campaigns.

"efficient energy and delay tradeoff for vessel communications in sdn based maritime wireless networks","2021","The maritime communication network is assembled by emergent network technologies. However, the adverse maritime environment impedes the efficiency of resources allocation in maritime communication network. Here we show a joint sleeping scheduling and opportunistic transmission scheme in delay-tolerant maritime wireless communication networks based on software defined networking (SDN) to find a better tradeoff between the energy consumption and the delay. Specifically, an energy-limited delay tolerant networking (DTN) node deployed in the ocean receives/transmits data from/to vessels within its communication range. To further save the energy, a long-term energy minimization problem is formulated with sleeping scheduling and opportunistic transmission. After that, a multi-objective minimization problem of energy and delay is first modeled by Lyapunov optimization (LO), which then is solved by convex optimization.

"uses and misuses of the automatic identification system","2019","The Automatic Identification System (AIS) is widely used by mariners at sea as a compulsory collision prevention device on-board. Since the inception of collaborative platforms that gather AIS messages received by a network of stations, large worldwide AIS datasets can be assembled and enable a series of analyses of the maritime traffic, including an increase of the maritime domain awareness, the assessment and prediction of trajectories, the detection of anomalies, the measurement of fishing pressure, vessel-born noise and air pollution and the global modelling of the maritime traffic. However a series of misuses of the AIS does exist, and data may lack reliability as some users broadcast errors or intentionally falsify the information sent by the device. In this respect, a methodology to assess the integrity and veracity of AIS messages has been developed, leading to the determination of maritime risks in support to maritime monitoring activities. In this paper, an exemplification is proposed, based on AIS possible integrity issues on kinematic data.","identification technology,maritime traffic,collaborative platforms,Marine vehicles,Monitoring,maritime domain awareness,AIS messages,Reliability,Sea measurements,compulsory collision prevention device,fishing pressure,maritime monitoring activities,ships,automatic identification system,maritime risks,marine safety,Automatic Identification System,data falsification,Artificial intelligence,large worldwide AIS datasets,risk analysis,vessel-born noise,Trajectory,marine communication,air pollution,Navigation,collision avoidance,AIS possible integrity issues,"
"seasonal oceanographic changes and their implications for the abundance of small pelagic fishes in the southern south china sea","2022","The seasonal variations in shelf circulation and their implications for the distribution of light fishing vessels positions (VBD) that capture small pelagic fishes in the southern South China Sea (SSCS) are investigated by using multi-datasets between 2008–2014. It is found that the SSCS shelf circulation is indicated by the strong seasonal reversal western boundary current (WBC) and prominent cyclonic circulation (eddy). The southeastward WBC brings homogeneous salty, colder, and high primary production of nanophytoplankton (PPN) water during winter-time from the northern and the cyclonic eddy region into the southern SSCS. In contrast, less salty, warmer, and less PPN are advected northwestward from Karimata into the northern region. These factors significantly influence the distribution of VBD and in turn the production of captured small pelagic fishes (CPUE), revealing two maxima (peaks) of both VBD and CPUE during the monsoon breaks (MB) with a time-lag of 2–3 month from the monsoon peaks. Relationship between oceanographic parameters and CPUE is examined statistically revealing that ocean current and PPN are significantly affect the CPUE. A relatively high PPN and strong current during the peaks of monsoon are correlated with lower CPUE. In contrast, during the MBs period CPUE maxima are associated with a relatively weak ocean current and consumed PPN that favor the abundance of small pelagic fishes.","Small pelagic fishes,Southern South China Sea,Light fishing vessels,Oceanographic parameters,"
"chapter four - the coral sea: physical environment, ecosystem status and biodiversity assets","2013","The Coral Sea, located at the southwestern rim of the Pacific Ocean, is the only tropical marginal sea where human impacts remain relatively minor. Patterns and processes identified within the region have global relevance as a baseline for understanding impacts in more disturbed tropical locations. Despite 70 years of documented research, the Coral Sea has been relatively neglected, with a slower rate of increase in publications over the past 20 years than total marine research globally. We review current knowledge of the Coral Sea to provide an overview of regional geology, oceanography, ecology and fisheries. Interactions between physical features and biological assemblages influence ecological processes and the direction and strength of connectivity among Coral Sea ecosystems. To inform management effectively, we will need to fill some major knowledge gaps, including geographic gaps in sampling and a lack of integration of research themes, which hinder the understanding of most ecosystem processes.","Food web,Pristine ecosystems,Connectivity,Tropical sea,Collaborative research,Ecosystem function,"
"new insight into internal waves for maritime applications: a novel optical method with ocean experimental results","2021","Internal waves generated by the movement of surface and subsurface vehicles in the ocean have specific importance in maritime applications. These types of waves are categorized as forced internal waves. In this article, an attempt using a novel optical method is made to study the forced internal waves that are generated by a large surface vehicle in a controlled sea exercise. The optical method uses a diode laser operating at 635 nm and a lateral-effect position-sensitive photodetector. The laser beam undergoes modulation in both its intensity and beam positions with respect to the density variations that are caused in the stratified ocean by the forced internal waves. The experimental scheme, the system aspect of the optical method, and supporting theoretical aspects are detailed with corroborating experimental results. It is observed that the frequency of the forced internal waves also remains within the band of naturally occurring ambient oscillations in the ocean. The obtained results indicate that the forced internal waves detected by the optical method can be used for detecting the movement of maritime vehicles in the ocean.","lateral-effect position-sensing photodetector,optical method,maritime vehicles movement,remotely operated vehicles,Surface waves,Measurement by laser beam,Optical sensors,ocean waves,lateral-effect position-sensitive photodetector,photodetectors,laser beam,Internal waves,diode laser,semiconductor lasers,maritime applications,laser beams,laser beam deflection,Laser beams,naturally occurring ambient oscillations,naval anti-submarine warfare (ASW) applications,forced internal waves,Refractive index,ocean optics,wavelength 635.0 nm,oceanographic techniques,ocean experimental results,"
"historical ais data-driven unsupervised automatic extraction of directional maritime traffic networks","2020","Vessel experience route analysis can provide empirical support for maritime traffic management. Recently, the application of the Automatic Identification System (AIS) provides multi-dimensional data about voyages and vessels. However, traditional route extraction methods do not take into account information such as the vessel traffic pattern and the density distribution in the channel. The experience routes obtained is not accurate enough. This paper proposes an unsupervised method for extracting vessel experience routes from historical AIS data. The method consists of three parts: vessel traffic pattern extraction, channel boundary extraction, channel triangle network construction and hottest route extraction. The method comprehensively considers the spatiotemporal information and density distribution of the vessel trajectories, and constructs a directional maritime traffic network which can effectively convert historical data into information supporting decision-making.","Traffic control,vessel experience route analysis,data mining,Clustering algorithms,Kernel,empirical support,historical data,unsupervised method,Feature extraction,historical AIS data-driven unsupervised automatic extraction,Directional Maritime Traffic Network,maritime traffic management,vessel traffic pattern extraction,information supporting decision-making,channel triangle network construction,multidimensional data,density distribution,automatic identification system,marine safety,marine engineering,Traffic Pattern,channel boundary extraction,pattern clustering,decision making,Artificial intelligence,vessel trajectories,Trajectory,Triangular Network,traffic engineering computing,directional maritime traffic network,Data mining,voyages,vessel experience routes,"

"gpu-accelerated compression and visualization of large-scale vessel trajectories in maritime iot industries","2020","The automatic identification system (AIS), an automatic vessel-tracking system, has been widely adopted to perform intelligent traffic management and collision avoidance services in maritime Internet-of-Things (IoT) industries. With the rapid development of maritime transportation, tremendous numbers of AIS-based vessel trajectory data have been collected, which make trajectory data compression imperative and challenging. This article mainly focuses on the compression and visualization of large-scale vessel trajectories and their graphics processing unit (GPU)-accelerated implementations. The visualization was implemented to investigate the influence of compression on vessel trajectory data quality. In particular, the Douglas-Peucker (DP) and kernel density estimation (KDE) algorithms, respectively, utilized for trajectory compression and visualization, were significantly accelerated through the massively parallel computation capabilities of the GPU architecture. Comprehensive experiments on trajectory compression and visualization have been conducted on large-scale AIS data of recording ship movements collected from three different water areas, i.e., the South Channel of Yangtze River Estuary, the Chengshan Jiao Promontory, and the Zhoushan Islands. Experimental results illustrated that: 1) the proposed GPU-based parallel implementation frameworks could significantly reduce the computational time for both trajectory compression and visualization; 2) the influence of compressed vessel trajectories on trajectory visualization could be negligible if the compression threshold was selected suitably; and 3) the Gaussian kernel was capable of generating more appropriate KDE-based visualization performance by comparing with other seven kernel functions.","trajectory compression,Douglas-Peucker algorithm,vessel trajectory data quality,trajectory visualization,Internet of Things,Industries,GPU-accelerated compression,large-scale vessel trajectories,data visualisation,Acceleration,compression threshold,vessel trajectory,parallel computing,ships,KDE-based visualization,marine safety,kernel density estimation,marine engineering,GPU-based parallel implementation frameworks,maritime transportation,graphics processing units,automatic identification system,collision avoidance services,maritime IoT industries,intelligent traffic management,compressed vessel trajectories,KDE algorithm,Artificial intelligence,AIS-based vessel trajectory data,data compression,Data visualization,graphics processing unit (GPU),graphics processing unit,Graphics processing units,Trajectory,maritime Internet-of-Things industries,large-scale AIS data,marine vehicles,automatic vessel-tracking system,"
"drought-triggered western spruce budworm outbreaks in the interior pacific northwest: a multi-century dendrochronological record","2014","Douglas-fir forests in the interior Pacific Northwest are subject to sporadic outbreaks of the western spruce budworm, a species widely recognized as the most destructive defoliator in western North America. Outbreaks of the western spruce budworm often occur synchronously over broad regions and lead to widespread loss of leaf area and decrease in growth rates in affected stands. In spite of the ecological and economic significance of this defoliator, the mechanisms controlling this species’ population dynamics are still not fully understood. We used dendrochronological methods to reconstruct three centuries of western spruce budworm outbreaks at thirteen sites along a transect running from central Oregon to western Montana and compared the outbreak reconstructions with regional drought history. The reconstructions reveal repeated western spruce budworm outbreaks that sometimes persisted more than a decade and were significantly synchronous among sites. Synchrony was higher in the second half of the record, possibly due to changes in forest composition and structure brought about by land use practices. Across stands and regions, there was a moderately strong relationship between initiation of synchronous outbreaks and periods of transitional climate conditions in which moisture availability was below average prior to outbreak initiation, but above average in the first few years of an outbreak. There was a weak relationship between cessation of outbreaks and one or more years of high moisture availability. Outbreaks tended to occur near the end of droughts. The association between climatic variability and outbreak dynamics observed across this transect indicates that climate is an important driver of western spruce budworm outbreaks. Other factors that we did not test, but that may influence outbreak dynamics include stand structure, forest composition, predation, and phenological synchrony between larvae and host trees. Future changes in western spruce budworm outbreak dynamics will be determined by a combination of changing climate, interactions with other disturbance agents, and changing forest composition and structure. Our results suggest that western spruce budworm outbreaks will likely intensify if drought frequency increases in the future.","Dendrochronology,Pacific Northwest,Drought,Western spruce budworm,Defoliators,Insect outbreaks,"
"efficient scheduling for video transmissions in maritime wireless communication networks","2015","This paper develops a framework for vessel surveillance video uploading via maritime wideband communication networks. A broadband wireless network utilizing a time-division-multiple-access (TDMA)-based media access control protocol is employed to establish a shore-side network infrastructure, and a packet store-carry-forward routing mechanism is adopted to achieve intermittent network connectivity in maritime communications. To provide high-quality videos to the administrative authority, a resource allocation problem is formulated to maximize the throughput priority-based video transmission problem, subject to the intermittent network connections and the time indexes such as the release time and deadline of each video packet. To reduce computational complexity, time-capacity mapping is applied to transform the original resource allocation problem into a two-machine nonpreemptive scheduling problem. Three offline scheduling algorithms are proposed, namely, a time-capacity-mapping-based two-phase (TMTP) algorithm for a single machine, a TMTP algorithm for two machines, and an interval graph-theory-based job relay selection (IGTJRS) algorithm. It is mathematically proved that the IGTJRS algorithm has an approximation ratio (i.e., the ratio of the throughput of an optimal schedule to that of the IGTJRS algorithm) of 2 and time complexity of O(n2).

"are shipwrecks a real hazard for the ecosystem in the mediterranean sea?","2017","The aim of the present study was to evaluate the hazard from shipwrecks on communities by a holistic approach taking into account different effects on biological communities. Multibeam and Remotely Operated Vehicles surveys recorded ecological assessment of fish and benthic species on three shipwrecks flooded during the Second World War on Maërl beds habitats in the strait of Sicily. Pollution levels of a wide range of chemicals of ecotoxicological concern were also measured in sediments and in fish species from different trophic levels. Statistical analysis evidenced significant differences among pollutant levels between both sediments and fish collected in shipwreck sites and controls. Concerning fish, significant effects due to the vessel's cargo type and flooding position are recorded. In spite of that, our results underline that shipwrecks are also a hotspots of biodiversity and a habitat for preservation strategies in marine ecosystems that need to be monitored.","trace elements,PAHs,Pollution,POPs,Lampedusa Island,beds habitats,"
"distribution of sulfur aerosol precursors in the spcz released by continuous volcanic degassing at ambrym, vanuatu","2016","The Melanesian Volcanic Arc (MVA) emits about 12kTd−1 of sulfur dioxide (SO2) to the atmosphere from continuous passive (non-explosive) volcanic degassing, which contributes 20% of the global SO2 emission from volcanoes. Here we assess, from up-to-date and long-term observations, the SO2 emission of the Ambrym volcano, one of the dominant volcanoes in the MVA, and we investigate its role as sulfate precursor on the regional distribution of aerosols, using both satellite observations and model results at 1°×1° spatial resolution from WRF-Chem/GOCART. Without considering aerosol forcing on clouds, our model parameterizations for convection, vertical mixing and cloud properties provide a reliable chemical weather representation, making possible a cross-examination of model solution and observations. This preliminary work enables the identification of biases and limitations affecting both the model (missing sources) and satellite sensors and algorithms (for aerosol detection and classification) and leads to the implementation of improved transport and aerosol processes in the modeling system. On the one hand, the model confirms a 50% underestimation of SO2 emissions due to satellite swath sampling of the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI), consistent with field studies. The OMI irregular sampling also produces a level of noise that impairs its monitoring capacity during short-term volcanic events. On the other hand, the model reveals a large sensitivity on aerosol composition and Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) due to choices of both the source function in WRF-Chem and size parameters for sea-salt in FlexAOD, the post-processor used to compute offline the simulated AOD. We then proceed to diagnosing the role of SO2 volcanic emission in the regional aerosol composition. The model shows that both dynamics and cloud properties associated with the South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ) have a large influence on the oxidation of SO2 and on the transport pathways of volcanic species across the South Pacific atmosphere. For example, in the tropical cloudy air, the sulfate production in the aqueous phase is very efficient, resulting in the formation of a large cloud of highly scattering sulfate aerosols advected horizontally to Eastern Indonesia, in agreement with the AOD feature captured by MODIS/Aqua, but missed in CALIOP/CALIPSO (lidar) products. Model sensitivity experiments indicate that aerosol re-suspension due to evaporating droplets is a significant pathway for the supply of volcanic sulfur species in the remote marine boundary layer. By strongly modulating the irreversible loss due to wet scavenging, this aerosol process has a similar influence on the sulfur burden as natural emission from volcanoes or biogenic sources like dimethyl sulfate (DMS). The results emphasize the importance of MVA passive degassing and SPCZ dynamics on the aerosol background, and raise questions about potential impacts on the local climate and marine ecosystems.","Volcanic plume impacts,Aerosol modeling,SO dispersal,SPCZ dynamics,Remote sensing,Regional aerosol climatology,"
"towards video packets store-carry-and-forward scheduling in maritime wideband communication","2013","In this paper, we investigate uploading monitoring videos for vessels via a maritime wideband communication network. The Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX) technology is utilized to establish a shore-side network infrastructure, and a packet store-carry-and-forward routing mechanism is implemented to address the intermittent network connectivity in maritime communications. A resource allocation problem is formulated to maximize the weights of uploaded video packets, subject to the intermittent network connections and the release time and deadline of each video packet. Time-capacity mapping is applied to transform the original resource allocation problem to a two-machine non-preemptive scheduling problem. As ship routes are relatively stable, the global information in terms of release time, deadline and other time indices of video packets, as well as the schedules of vessels is known a priori. We propose two offline scheduling algorithms, namely Time-capacity mapping based two phase (TMTP) algorithm, and Interval graph theory based job relay selection (IGTJRS) algorithm.

"accurate ship tracking in maritime images with kernelized correlation filter and curve fitting","2019","At present, the single tracking algorithm is generally used to achieve the single-target ship tracking task. Although the tracking result is ideal at this time, when the target ship is blocked by other obstacles, the tracking result will be greatly reduced.

In the first step, the KCF algorithm is used to obtain accurate position data of the target target ship before and after occlusion and position data of the occluded stage.

"shell disease in eastern oysters, crassostrea virginica, reared in france","2002","Progeny of eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica, introduced into France in 1992, were reared in IFREMER facilities to test their growth performances. During the summer of 1993, sporadic mass mortalities (80–90%) occurred among C. virginica spat reared in the IFREMER laboratories in La Tremblade (Charente Maritime, France) and Bouin (Vendée, France). Affected oysters presented mantle retraction and deposition of an anomalous conchiolin layer on the inner surface of the shell. The incidence of oysters with gross signs exceeded 80%. No obvious pathogen was identified in soft tissues by histology and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). However, histological examination showed the presence of anomalous basophilic round structures, 0.5–1 μm in diameter, in gill and mantle connective tissues. These extracellular Feulgen-negative structures reacted positively with the von Kossa stain. TEM examination on mantle and gill samples in diseased spat showed that the basophilic bodies consisted of concentric deposits of an amorphous substance interpreted as containing calcium. These observations may indicate that the mineralization process in spat shells was disturbed without exact determination of the cause. Based on the similarities of the gross signs to those reported in juvenile eastern oysters in the United States, we believe that the cause of the mortalities observed in France was probably the Juvenile Oyster Disease. Moreover, we report for the first time the detection of anomalous amorphous structures in gill and mantle connective tissues associated with mortalities and deposition of an anomalous conchioloin layer on the inner shell surface in C. virginica spat.",""
"gnss-based passive radar for maritime surveillance: long integration time mti technique","2017","The exploitation of the Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) as transmitters of opportunity in passive radar systems for maritime surveillance is particularly attractive because of the main advantages consisting in a global coverage (even in open sea) and in the availability of multiple sources (different satellites and constellations).

"real time observations of oceanographic and meteorological parameters for maritime transportation: origins and novel applications","2018","The first NOAA Physical Oceanographic Real-Time System (PORTSÂ®) was established in Tampa Bay, Florida, becoming operational in 1991 (https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/ports/index.shtml?port=tb). In April 2018, the Miami Physical Oceanographic Real-Time System was dedicated as the 30th such system in the US, followed closely by Port Everglades PORTSÂ® in June 2018 as the 31st. PORTSÂ® collects and disseminates real time meteorological and oceanographic data within major harbors around the US. PORTSÂ® data are an essential component for maintaining the safety and efficiency of maritime operations. Before the advent of PORTSÂ®, knowledge of environmental conditions relevant to ship operations in US harbors was generally limited to wind and precipitation sensors at the local airports and similar shipboard instrumentation. Water levels were inferred from standard tide tables even though surface winds were known to produce significant deviations from predicted values. This incomplete knowledge often led to navigational errors and to accidents. This paper will review the history of PORTSÂ® development, highlighting recent advances in sensor technologies and novel uses of PORTSÂ® data. On May 9, 1980, the 580 foot, 20,000 ton bulk carrier Summit Venture was approaching a critical turn toward the Sunshine Skyway Bridge in Tampa Bay, Florida and was overtaken by a violent, blinding thunderstorm. The ship veered off course and crashed into a main support pier of the bridge, collapsing the southbound span. Thirty-six people in vehicles fell into the water; 35 did not survive. The main ship channel into Tampa Bay port facilities was closed for 6 weeks, causing severe disruption to supplies of fuel and other commodities to the entire central Florida region. In the wake of the disaster, the local maritime community, led by the Tampa Bay Pilots Association and the Tampa Port Authority, petitioned the US Congress for funding to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to improve environmental monitoring capabilities in the bay. Nearly a decade later, the Tampa Bay Oceanography Project (TOP) began in 1990 as part of NOAA's Coastal Ocean Circulation Program (COCP). This included a 15 month study of currents, water levels, water temperatures, salinity, winds, and other meteorological/oceanographic parameters. By the end of the project, TOP had collected the largest number of circulation measurements in one estuary in the 100-year history of COCP. Successful completion of TOP was followed by permanent deployment of real-time telemetered sensors measuring winds, currents, and water levels at critical locations in the bay - the first official NOAA PORTSÂ® installation. Since 1991, local operations and maintenance of the system have been directed by the Greater Tampa Bay Marine Advisory Council-PORTS, Inc., a non-profit consortium of maritime interests, through cooperative agreements with the NOAA National Ocean Service Center for Operational Products and Services and the University of South Florida Center for Maritime and Port Studies. The success of TB-PORTS made it a prototype for a national program. Within three years of TB-PORTS becoming operational, San Francisco Bay and Houston/Galveston Bay implemented their own PORTSÂ® networks. Today PORTSÂ® operates 24 hours a day/7 days a week in 31 locations around the coasts and Great Lakes of the United States and is a component of the Integrated Ocean Observing System national backbone. The local operation and maintenance of PORTSÂ® facilities in each port remains funded by local maritime interests under the direction of NOAA/NOS/CO-OPS, who sets operational standards and manages the data quality control and dissemination through the Continuous Operational Real-Time Monitoring System (CORMS). PORTSÂ® data are provided to the public through the NOAA websitehttp://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/ports.html. A prototype project in Tampa Bay provides PORTSÂ® data to pilots aboard ships over the Automatic Identification System (AIS), now required on all commercial vessels over 20 m in length, in collaboration with the US Coast Guard R&D Center. The long time series observations of winds, currents, water levels, and other parameters in Tampa Bay from PORTSÂ® has fueled numerous scientific studies on the dynamics of the estuary. New sensor technologies have been incorporated into the PORTSÂ® data stream in recent years, including wave height, period, and direction, atmospheric visibility, and most recently, current measurements from sensors mounted on standard US Coast Guard aids to navigation buoys.","water levels,tides,Marine vehicles,transportation,https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/ports/index.shtml,Bridges,Sea measurements,environmental monitoring (geophysics),Maritime transportation,oceanographic equipment,ships,marine safety,real-time systems,Oceans,US Government agencies,NOAA websitehttp://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/ports.html,quality control,sea ports,Real-time systems,oceanographic regions,Tampa Bay port facilities,wind,precision navigation,bridges (structures),ocean observing,Greater Tampa Bay Marine Advisory Council-PORTS,Sensors,Port Everglades PORTS,TB-PORTS,oceanographic techniques,"

"a review on northern hemisphere sea-ice, storminess and the north atlantic oscillation: observations and projected changes","2011","The Arctic has undergone substantial changes over the last few decades in various cryospheric and derivative systems and processes. Of these, the Arctic sea ice regime has seen some of the most rapid change and is one of the most visible markers of Arctic change outside the scientific community. This has drawn considerable attention not only from the natural sciences, but increasingly, from the political and commercial sectors as they begin to grapple with the problems and opportunities that are being presented. The possible impacts of past and projected changes in Arctic sea ice, especially as it relates to climatic response, are of particular interest and have been the subject of increasing research activity. A review of the current knowledge of the role of sea ice in the climate system is therefore timely. We present a review that examines both the current state of understanding, as regards the impacts of sea-ice loss observed to date, and climate model projections, to highlight hypothesised future changes and impacts on storm tracks and the North Atlantic Oscillation. Within the broad climate-system perspective, the topics of storminess and large-scale variability will be specifically considered. We then consider larger-scale impacts on the climatic system by reviewing studies that have focused on the interaction between sea-ice extent and the North Atlantic Oscillation. Finally, an overview of the representation of these topics in the literature in the context of IPCC climate projections is presented. While most agree on the direction of Arctic sea-ice change, the rates amongst the various projections vary greatly. Similarly, the response of storm tracks and climate variability are uncertain, exacerbated possibly by the influence of other factors. A variety of scientific papers on the relationship between sea-ice changes and atmospheric variability have brought to light important aspects of this complex topic. Examples are an overall reduction in the number of Arctic winter storms, a northward shift of mid-latitude winter storms in the Pacific and a delayed negative NAO-like response in autumn/winter to a reduced Arctic sea-ice cover (at least in some months). This review paper discusses this research and the disagreements, bringing about a fresh perspective on this issue.","Review,Arctic amplification,Teleconnection,Sea ice,Storms,North Atlantic Oscillation,Climate change,Arctic,"
"visual analytic based ship collision probability modeling for ship navigation safety","2021","This study presents a tangible visual analytic tool to analyse maritime traffic in spatio-temporal basis using AIS data. This novel approach helps in understanding the macroscopic safety structure of both fairways and individual ships with evidences in microscopic level. Qualification of our system is demonstrated with 7-days AIS trajectory collected from Mexican Gulf. We find out that spatio-temporal position pattern of encountered ships in Port Houston varies over time, significantly. In addition, the spatial distribution of ship accidents coincide with proposed near-miss density areas. Furthermore, proposed tool is capable of capturing real accident cases. Field experiments with domain experts have demonstrated that our approach helps in making realistic inferences about navigational safety behaviour of both individual vessel and water area.","Probability,Ship collision,Visual analytic,Maritime safety,"
"augmented reality for maritime navigation assistance - egocentric depth perception in large distance outdoor environments","2021","Augmented reality (AR) provides enormous potential to improve navigation assistance interfaces by displaying information directly into the user's field of view. In maritime contexts, such AR interfaces could supplement conventional solutions that require users to interpret spatial positions visualized on two-dimensional maps. In order to design useful navigation assistance, it is crucial to understand how egocentric distances of displayed objects are perceived and how different design attributes influence depth estimation. While previous research mainly focused on depth perception in indoor environments and rather short distances, this paper presents an investigation of the perceived egocentric distance of virtual objects in distances up to 75 meters in an open outdoor environment. In a perceptual matching task experiment using the Microsoft HoloLens 2, participants had to move objects with different (i) shape, (ii) coloration, and (iii) relation to floor to various target distances. Our results suggest that participants overestimated the distance to virtual objects across all tested distances since they significantly underproduced target distances for all investigated design factors. Based on these results, we explored potential design implications for a maritime AR navigation assistance on a ship in the local port area.","augmented reality,Microsoft HoloLens 2,navigation assistance interfaces,spatial positions,human computer interaction,open outdoor environment,ship,marine navigation,egocentric depth perception,indoor environments,design attributes,perceptual matching task experiment,ships,Performance evaluation,marine engineering,distance outdoor environments,Seaports,Shape,perceived egocentric distance,depth estimation,AR interfaces,Indoor environment,two-dimensional maps,maritime navigation assistance,local port area,displayed objects,target distances,Human-centered computing-Human computer interaction (HCI)-Interaction paradigms-Mixed/augmented reality,maritime AR navigation assistance,Visualization,Human-centered computing-Visualization-Empirical studies in visualization-,Navigation,Rendering (computer graphics),virtual objects,user field of view,"
"“ship-port-country” multi-dimensional research on the fine analysis of china's lng trade","2023","Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) is a clean and low-carbon energy source that plays an important role in combating global warming. As the world's largest greenhouse gas (GHG) emitter, China has taken coal-to-gas as an important measure to reduce GHG emissions, and has become the world's largest LNG importer. Studying the patterns and characteristics of China's LNG trade is of great significance for ensuring energy supply security, formulating and adjusting energy strategies. However, the refined analysis of China's LNG trade is still inadequate, mainly due to the lack of research on the details of ship trajectories and port attributes. Therefore, a “ship-port-country” multidimensional LNG trade analysis method is proposed to improve the timeliness, multi-dimensionality and fineness of China's LNG trade analysis. The multidimensional characteristics of China's LNG trade are analyzed by studying the big data of nearly 3.5 billion automatic identification system (AIS) records in 2017. The study has found that (1) The arrival frequency of China's LNG trading ships varies greatly with time. For example, the most frequent daily arrivals are between 04:00 and 05:00 in the morning, while the least frequent arrivals are between 15:00 and 17:00 in the afternoon. (2) The Chinese LNG trade network consisting of 79 ports has been formed, of which NANTONG Port is the most important port. (3) The LNG trade volume calculated in this study has shown a strong correlation with the national LNG trade statistics and can be used to analyze LNG trade with higher spatial and temporal resolution. According to the characteristics of LNG trade at the three levels of ship, port and country, China can optimize its LNG trade policy from the following aspects: (1) Dynamically allocate port resources according to the arrival frequency of LNG tankers to reduce port congestion and waste of resources. (2) Expand core LNG trading ports such as NANTONG Port, ZHOUSHAN Port, TANGSHAN (JINGTANG) Port, XIUYU Port, DALIAN Port and LUSHUN Port. (3) Actively realize the diversification of LNG trading partners to reduce the dependence of LNG import sources on one country or region, and ensure energy security. The “ship-port-country” multi-level LNG trade analysis method proposed in this study provides a new research perspective for the analysis of the LNG trade pattern. This study reveals the multidimensional characteristics of China's LNG trade, which can provide decision-making support for China to formulate reasonable LNG trade policies and energy security policies, and is conducive to the stable and sustainable development of global LNG trade.","Multidimensional analysis,Ship trajectory data,China's LNG trade,LNG trade,Fine-grained trade characteristics,"

"contextual multi-armed bandits for data caching in intermittently-connected lossy maritime networks","2023","Information centric networking (ICN) is a promising architecture for intermittently-connected lossy maritime networks. By decoupling content from location and storing popular content in caches ICNs enable content access even when content producers are disconnected from the network. However, network-resource constraints, node mobility, and low data rates remain as major challenges to achieve the potential benefits that increased data bring to maritime networks. In this work, we propose an ICN architecture that uses dedicated caches and off-path caching to deliver popular network content to consumers. Our architecture motivates a data-caching problem in which each cache must define effective and efficient caching policies, with effectiveness assessed based on the cache-hit ratio achieved by the cache and efficiency assessed based on the usage of the communications budget allocated for data caching purposes. This work develops an online caching algorithm that enables dedicated caches to sequentially decide what content to cache.

"collaborative multiple access and energy-efficient resource allocation in distributed maritime wireless networks","2022","With the rapid increasing of maritime activities, maritime wireless networks (MWNs) with high reliability, high energy efficiency, and low delay are required. However, the centralized networking with fixed resource scheduling is not suitable for MWNs due to the special environment.

To further improve the network performance, we formulate an energy efficiency (EE) maximization resource allocation problem and solve it by an iterative algorithm based on the Dinkelbach method.

"shipping lane-aware caching and transmission scheme for maritime wireless networks","2020","The shipping lane is one of the most important information of vessels, which is useful in maritime communications. This paper presents a cache-enabled maritime communication network architecture where the shipborne base stations with the cache storages serve as the relay points between the user ships and the shore based networks. Under this architecture, we promote the total network throughput by exploiting the specific characteristics of the maritime shipping lane information. In particular, we use the shipping lanes to calculate the large-scale channel state information (CSI) and predict the future user associations. We propose a shipping lane aware cross-layer resource allocation algorithm to optimize the system throughput in terms of the caching strategy, power allocation and bandwidth allocation, which is a mix-integer non-convex programming problem.

"mvffnet: multi-view feature fusion network for imbalanced ship classification","2021","The accurate classification of moving ships is of fundamental importance to maritime authorities for ensuring the safety and security of shipping operations. With the wide use of automatic identification systems (AISs), which allow ships to receive identification/location information from nearby ships, it is feasible to classify the types of ships by analysing ship behaviour from AIS-based trajectories. However, the imbalanced features of AIS data make it difficult to achieve satisfactory classification results in the presence of several different types of ships. To overcome these potential limitations, we propose a multi-view feature fusion network (MVFFNet) to achieve accurate ship classification with imbalanced data. To guarantee the powerful representation and generalization abilities of MVFFNet, we first extract several multi-view features (i.e., motion features and morphological features) from AIS-based ship trajectories. Several kinematic variables related to ship behaviour are empirically adopted as motion features. The morphological features are automatically extracted via convolutional auto-encoder (CAE) networks. CAE networks are capable of optimally learning the features from informative trajectory images, which are strictly related to the original ship trajectories. The bidirectional gated recurrent unit (BiGRU) network is then proposed to combine multi-view features to generate the ship classification results. In addition, a hybrid loss function is presented to handle the imbalance problem of ship types, potentially leading to enhanced robustness and accuracy of ship classification. Comprehensive experiments on two realistic datasets have demonstrated that our proposed MVFFNet consistently outperforms other competing methods in terms of classification accuracy and robustness.","Ship classification,BiGRU,Imbalanced data,Multi-view feature fusion,CAE,"
"robust infrared maritime target detection via anti-jitter spatialâ€“temporal trajectory consistency","2022","When detecting diverse infrared (IR) small maritime targets on complicated scenes, the existing methods get into trouble and unsatisfactory performance. The main reasons are as follows: 1) affected by target characteristics and ambient temperature and so on, both bright and dark targets may exist on IR maritime images in practical application and 2) spatial information and temporal correlation of targets are not fully excavated. To these problems, we propose a robust anti-jitter spatialâ€“temporal trajectory consistency (ASTTC) method, the main idea of which is to improve detection accuracy using single-frame detection followed by multi-frame decision. First, we innovatively design adaptive local gradient variation (ALGV) descriptor, which combines local dissimilarity measure with gradient magnitude distribution to enhance the local contrast for both bright and dark targets so that the suspected targets can be robustly extracted. For multi-frame decision, interframe displacement correction is necessary to eliminate the interference of IR imager motion and vibration for target codeword. We use pyramid optical flow to track feature point extracted by Shi-Tomasi to capture interframe registration coefficients. Then, the target position is corrected in the spatialâ€“temporal domain. Finally, a robust spatialâ€“temporal trajectory descriptor (STTD), which achieves target encoding and target trajectory consistency measurement, is designed to further confirm real targets and eliminate false targets. Experiments conducted on various real IR maritime image sequences demonstrate the applicability and robustness of ASTTC, which performs more satisfactorily than the existing methods in detection accuracy.","target characteristics,Pipelines,Optical imaging,ALGV descriptor,temporal correlation,robust spatial-temporal trajectory descriptor,image motion analysis,Feature extraction,gradient magnitude distribution,small-target detection,STTD,anti-jitter spatialâ€“temporal trajectory consistency (ASTTC),Adaptive local gradient variation (ALGV),Shi-Tomasi,robust infrared maritime target detection,multiframe decision,single-frame detection,robust anti-jitter spatial-temporal trajectory consistency,Target tracking,object detection,feature extraction,target encoding,IR imager motion,local dissimilarity measure,IR maritime image sequences,interframe registration capture,image registration,correlation methods,gradient methods,ASTTC,infrared imaging,Trajectory,image sequences,target trajectory consistency measurement,spatial information,Object detection,Adaptive optics,image capture,adaptive local gradient variation descriptor,"

"autonomous uav surveillance of a ship's path with mpc for maritime situational awareness","2017","Maritime Situational Awareness is crucial in maritime operations to identify threats and to deal with them as soon as possible. These threats can be pirates in shipping operations, icebergs when sailing in the northern sea routes, or even unknown vessels or objects that might be on the ship's path. A solution to identify these threats is the use of UAV's to overfly the ship's planned path. This solution is described in this paper, using an autonomous fixed wing UAV. Based on the provided ship's planned path, the UAV should autonomously map the area close to the ship track. To do that, an optimization problem is solved using Model Predictive Control, where the turn rate for the next time period is optimized. Based on the turn rate, the future path of the UAV is calculated and the waypoints are sent to the autopilot. This application is thoroughly tested using a Software In Loop environment, where an aircraft model is used with the autopilot's simulation.

This is done by the pre-extraction of contextual information as the baseline patterns of life (i.e., routes) in the area under investigation. In addition to a brief description of the approach to derive the routes, their characterization and representation is presented in support of exploitable knowledge to classify anomalies. A hierarchical reasoning is proposed where new tracks are first associated to existing routes based on their positional information only and â€œoff-routeâ€ vesselsâ€ are detected.

"optimal search facilities selection model for joint aeronautical and maritime search","2021","Joint aeronautical and maritime search and rescue is the most effective way of performing rescues at sea. The value and effectiveness of a search and rescue (SAR) are far greater when using a coordinated air-maritime search than when using only vessels or aircraft. However, the harmonization of aeronautical and maritime SAR is complex and potentially life-threatening. When the location of the target in distress is unknown, the search process must be carried out. As the sole way to locate and rescue survivors, the search process is the most costly, hazardous, and complicated part of the whole SAR operation. This article focuses on the key problem of the optimal selection of search facilities, that is often encountered in large-area maritime search practice and urgently needs to be solved in joint aeronautical and maritime search operations. The problem may be abstracted into an optimization model with vessel and aircraft quantitative constraints that fully considers the area of the sea region to be searched, maximum speeds, search capabilities, initial distances of vessels and aircraft from the search area, and maximum endurance of aircraft. By introducing 0-1 decision variables, the search facility selection can be judged and optimized directly and effectively.

For this reason, the information about Position, Navigation, and Time (PNT) is necessary for the safety and efficiency of ship movement, especially in high-density traffic areas such as port entrances, channels or inland waterways. In this context, the GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) has become the main source of PNT for maritime navigation. However, in some critical conditions, the use of GNSS alone have some shortfalls, especially in coastal navigation, with the consequent need to enhance accuracy and integrity information. Such enhancement can be available from augmentation techniques. Among them, the users can take advantage of Satellite-Based Augmentation Systems (SBASs). In particular, in the current work, the performance of European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS) augmentation are verified in terms of accuracy in position domain showing evident improvements, especially on vertical component of the position.","Satellite navigation systems,Safety,inland waterways,European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service augmentation,marine navigation,Global Positioning System,SBAS,Sea measurements,Maritime,Positioning,coastal navigation,ships,maritime navigation,Seaports,EGNOS performances assessment,EGNOS,maritime community,ship movement,inland navigation,Receivers,Data collection,shipping safety,integrity information,Global Navigation Satellite System,Global navigation satellite system,"

"footprints of fishing vessels in chinese waters based on automatic identification system data","2022","The importance and difficulty of large-scale quantitative analysis of fishing vessel footprints and fishing intensities with high resolution have received more and more attention and recognition in fishery research. In this study, a framework for identifying and analyzing fishing footprints and activities based on AIS data is proposed. The first step is the AIS data pre-processing. Through the screening and cleaning of AIS data, noise data such as non-fishing vessel trajectories are removed to retain only fishing vessel trajectories. The second step is the behavior detection of fishing vessels. Based on the proposed speed identification method, the trajectory of a fishing vessel is divided into three states: Fishing, stationary, and sailing. The third step is the calculation of fishing vessel activities. An adjacent point mean method is proposed to calculate the fishing time of each fishing point. In addition, two simple and efficient quantitative indicators, namely unit cell activity frequency (UCAF) and unit cell fishing time (UCFT), are proposed to quantify the activities of fishing vessels. The last step is the spatial and temporal analysis of fishing activities. The global Moran's index and Getis-Ord Gi* index are used to quantitatively describe the global spatio-temporal distribution and local spatio-temporal hotspots of fishing activities. Based on >130 million AIS data from 2015 to 2016, the footprints of fishing vessels in the waters of China's exclusive economic zone (EEZ) were analyzed and the 0.01° × 0.01° high-resolution fishing vessel activity distribution maps and fishing time distribution maps were generated. It is found that the footprints of fishing vessels in China's EEZ waters have a positive spatial correlation, and the areas with high fishing intensities are clustered in the coastal waters of Shandong Province, Zhejiang Province, Fujian Province and Guangdong Province. The research results can be used for fishing area identification, fishery policy making, and sustainable fisheries development.","Quantitative analysis,Spatio-temporal analysis,Fisheries management,Chinese fishery,Fishing activity,Trajectory analysis,"
"a multi-scalar approach to marine survey and underwater archaeological site prospection in murujuga, western australia","2021","During the past 20,000 years approximately one-quarter of the continental landmass of Australia was inundated by postglacial sea-level rise, submerging archaeological evidence for use of these landscapes. Underwater archaeological sites can offer substantial insights into past lifeways and adaptations to rapidly changing environments, however the vast scale of inundation presents a range of challenges in discovering such sites. Here we present a suite of methods as a model methodology for locating sites in submerged landscapes. Priority areas for survey were based on palaeoenvironmental contexts determined from the onshore archaeological record. Remote sensing was used to identify seabed composition and indicators of palaeolandscapes where high potential for human occupation and site preservation could be identified in Murujuga (or the Dampier Archipelago), northwestern Australia. Target locations were surveyed by scientific divers to test for the presence of archaeological material. Application of this methodology resulted in the discovery of the first two confirmed sub-tidal ancient Aboriginal archaeological sites on Australia's continental shelf. Survey methods are discussed for their combined value to identify different classes of landscapes and archaeological features to support future underwater site prospection.","Submerged landscape archaeology,Bathymetric LiDAR,Marine geophysics,Underwater cultural heritage,Coastal geomorphology,"
"robust data association for multi-object detection in maritime environments using camera and radar measurements","2021","This letter presents a robust data association method for fusing camera and marine radar measurements in order to automatically detect surface ships and determine their locations with respect to the observing ship. In the preprocessing step for sensor fusion, convolutional neural networks are used to perform feature extraction from camera images and semantic segmentation from radar images. The correspondences between the camera and radar image features are optimized using a pair of geometric parameters, and the positions of all the matched object features are determined. The proposed method enables robust data association even without accurate calibration and alignment between the camera and radar measurements.

"ship trajectory uncertainty prediction based on a gaussian process model","2019","The uncertainty of ship trajectory prediction is addressed. In particular, a probabilistic trajectory prediction model is proposed that describes the uncertainty in future positions along the ship trajectories by continuous probability distributions. The ship motion prediction is decomposed into lateral and longitudinal directions, and position probabilities are calculated along these two directions. A data-driven non-parametric Bayesian model based on a Gaussian Process is proposed to describe the lateral motion uncertainty, while the longitudinal uncertainty results from the uncertainty on the ship acceleration along the route. The parameters of the probabilistic models are derived off-line based on historic trajectory information provided by Automatic Identification System (AIS) data. The model is then applied to predict the trajectory uncertainty in real time by iteratively updating the prior probability models based on new observed AIS data. Moreover, a sequential Cholesky decomposition algorithm is applied in this study to reduce the computational effort required by the Gaussian Process modelling. Three months of AIS data are used to train and test the proposed probabilistic trajectory prediction model. The results obtained show that the proposed method has high prediction accuracy and meets the demands of real-time applications.","Uncertainty modelling,AIS data,Gaussian process,Trajectory prediction,"

"humpback whale (megaptera novaeangliae) distribution and movements in the vicinity of south georgia and the south sandwich islands marine protected area","2022","Humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) are showing strong recovery from commercial whaling in the western South Atlantic. In this region, humpback whales migrate annually from their winter breeding grounds off the coast of Brazil to their summer feeding grounds near to the Polar Front, an area that includes the waters of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands (SGSSI). This latter region includes a Marine Protected Area (MPA), which has been developed to ensure sustainable management of fisheries, and protection of foraging predators. To date, management measures within the MPA have primarily been concerned with foraging predators that rely upon Antarctic krill, including for a number of previously over-exploited species. With humpback whales increasing in the western South Atlantic, understandingnderstanding their spatiotemporal distribution within the MPA is important as it will help inform management particularly in respect of interactions between humpback whales and the regional fishery for Antarctic krill. Here we develop habitat models from the distribution and movement patterns of 16 individuals at their high-latitude feeding grounds, south of 50°S. We show that whale habitat use varies throughout the foraging period. Upon reaching their feeding ground, whales use the area to the east of the South Sandwich Islands, moving westward into the centre of the Scotia Arc and towards South Georgia during the high summer, and then expanding back towards the east in the winter. Based on these findings, we discuss the implications for the future, including necessary research required for underpinning management.","Marine protected area,Habitat use,Antarctic,Whale,South Georgia,"

"design and implementation of a prototype with a low-cost sdr platform for the next generation of maritime communications","2022","In the last years, the increasing amount of maritime traffic has compromised the security of the AIS (Automatic Identification System). The use of two 25 KHz channels is not enough for the global amount of ships at seas. With the purpose of reinforcing the AIS, the VDES (VHF Data Exchange System) has been proposed in 2013. This system adds the AIS and four additional services, with challenges in modulation schemes, channel bandwidths and bit rates. The adoption of this new system implies a hardware challenge, because the VDES equipment could be more expensive than current commercial AIS transceivers. The SDR (Software-Defined Radio) technology is a versatile technology which could reduce the cost of the next generation of maritime communications equipment. In this paper, a prototype for the AIS and VDES is implemented on a low-cost SDR platform. Additionally, an RF circuit for filtering and amplifier in transmission and reception has been designed to improve the SDR performance.","low-cost SDR platform,VDES equipment,VHF data exchange system,modulation schemes,marine communication,Radio frequency,maritime traffic,Transceivers,Prototypes,commercial AIS transceivers,Artificial intelligence,Filtering,automatic identification system,ships,Security,maritime communications equipment,software radio,Hardware,"
"system controls of coastal and open ocean oxygen depletion","2021","The epoch of the Anthropocene, a period during which human activity has been the dominant influence on climate and the environment, has witnessed a decline in oxygen concentrations and an expansion of oxygen-depleted environments in both coastal and open ocean systems since the middle of the 20th century. This paper provides a review of system-specific drivers of low oxygen in a range of case studies representing marine systems in the open ocean, on continental shelves, in enclosed seas and in the coastal environment. Identification of similar and contrasting responses within and across system types and corresponding oxygen regimes is shown to be informative both in understanding and isolating key controlling processes and provides a sound basis for predicting change under anticipated future conditions. Case studies were selected to achieve a balance in system diversity and global coverage. Each case study describes system attributes, including the present-day oxygen environment and known trends in oxygen concentrations over time. Central to each case study is the identification of the physical and biogeochemical processes that determine oxygen concentrations through the tradeoff between ventilation and respiration. Spatial distributions of oxygen and time series of oxygen data provide the opportunity to identify trends in oxygen availability and have allowed various drivers of low oxygen to be distinguished through correlative and causative relationships. Deoxygenation results from a complex interplay of hydrographic and biogeochemical processes and the superposition of these processes, some additive and others subtractive, makes attribution to any particular driver challenging. System-specific models are therefore required to achieve a quantitative understanding of these processes and of the feedbacks between processes at varying scales.","Deoxygenation,Eutrophication,Respiration,Global warming,Stratification,Ventilation,"
"maritime smuggling detection and mitigation using risk-aware hybrid robotic sensor networks","2017","With the rise of more resourceful unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), their inclusion into robotic sensor networks (RSNs) is inevitable. The highly mobile nature of UAVs allows greater monitoring capabilities, making them most suitable for RSNs. Compared to traditional nodes in RSNs, UAVs suffer even more from communication disruptions and energy depletion, must often rapidly determine actions for themselves, and consequently require more autonomy. Prior work has been done in wireless sensor network (WSN)/aerial sensor network (ASN) coordination in a few applications such as protecting critical infrastructure, restoring communication between nodes, and healing networks, while other work has been accomplished on using the UAV network for augmenting the monitoring capabilities of WSNs. We introduce a novel methodology to integrate UAVs into RSNs for monitoring purposes by formulating the problem in the context of a risk management framework (RMF). This methodology allows a more precise risk feature classification and a more efficient task allocation for the ground network by utilizing the monitoring capabilities of the UAVs to informatively warn the RSN of any incoming events. We also present a fictitious but credible maritime smuggling scenario near the Port of Barcelona based on expert knowledge, and apply the methodology to detect and mitigate maritime smuggling. The network's behaviour is traced throughout the scenario and is repeated with civilian ships to assure that they are not flagged as smugglers. The applied methodology results in a successful classification and mitigation of the smuggling activity.","unmanned aerial vehicles,network healing,Risk management,risk feature classification,network behaviour,wireless sensor network,Marine vehicles,Wireless sensor networks,Monitoring,critical infrastructure protection,smuggling activity,Resource management,monitoring,Biological cells,task allocation,Robot sensing systems,aerial sensor network,wireless sensor networks,police,WSN-ASN coordination,maritime smuggling detection,pattern classification,communication disruption,critical infrastructures,autonomous aerial vehicles,energy depletion,ground network,maritime smuggling mitigation,monitoring capability,Port of Barcelona,risk management framework,civilian ships,UAV network,risk-aware hybrid robotic sensor networks,"
"on the interest of data mining for an integrity assessment of ais messages","2016","Put in place by the International Maritime Organization, the Automatic Identification System is a worldwide maritime electronic system that sends radio broadcasted messages at a high rate between the stations, either on board the vessels or on shores.

The high rate of transmission implies a considerable amount of data to process in order to point out those irregularities. This paper proposes a method based on data mining and clustering methods combined to an integrity assessment of AIS messages for anomaly detection, with a proposition of software architecture for a data processing done both on-the-fly and with archived data.

"triton: high-speed maritime wireless mesh network","2013","This article presents the TRI-media Telematic Oceanographic Network (TRITON) project, which aims to develop a high-speed and low-cost maritime communication system. The article includes information pertaining to background studies, high-level architecture, network feasibility, maritime communication environment, technology developments, prototype implementations and link performance measurements. The motivation for this project stems from the fact that there is an increasing need for low-cost and high-speed maritime communication, with demands mainly coming from regulatory and crew welfare needs. The system described in this article is a wireless mesh network based on the IEEE 802.16. An analysis of the node connectivity based on real ship traffic data shows that the network is feasible in shipping lanes with a high density of ships. The system also considers the use of an intelligent middleware to allow communications to switch back to a satellite link in cases where neighboring ships are sparse or at locations far away from mesh base stations.

"the small world of global marine crude oil trade based on crude oil tanker flows","2022","Global marine crude oil trade is a direct reflection of global economic trends. This study uses the real-world historical ship automatic identification system (AIS) data from 2014 to 2017 to explore the flows of crude oil tanker trade between ports and construct a port-node global crude oil trade model. An analysis framework of “AIS data -> crude oil tanker trade flows -> port-node crude oil trade network -> port-node crude oil trade backbone network” is proposed to realize the progressive analysis of global marine crude oil trade. The global port-node crude oil trade network is a small world, in which there are multiple small world port-node trade communities. Compared with the community structure of the global port-node crude oil trade in previous years, the Middle East–Southern Africa–South Asia–Oceania–Asia Pacific community and the Southern Africa–China community have more activities in port nodes and trade links in 2017, which reflects that the Asia-Pacific region, especially East Asian countries, is making efforts to expand the Oceania and African markets and increase the diversity of crude oil import sources to ensure the security of crude oil supply and demand.","Complex network,Small world,Trade community,Crude oil trade,"

AIS equipment aboard vessels continuously and autonomously transmits information about the vessel including its identity, position, course and speed to enhance safety. This information has also come to be seen by the U. S. Coast Guard as a critical tool in enhancing Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) in support of all Coast Guard missions. MDA is the effective understanding of anything associated with the global maritime environment that could affect the security, safety, economy, or environment of the United States. To achieve MDA, the Coast Guard must collect as much information as possible on activities occurring in the maritime domain. A large part of this activity relates to the movement of vessels, therefore detection, classification, identification and monitoring of vessels is a key component of MDA.

"maritime traffic probabilistic prediction based on ship motion pattern extraction","2022","This paper proposes a novel maritime traffic prediction method based on ship motion pattern extraction, considering ship destination prediction and ship trajectory prediction within a specific route. To extract ship motion patterns from historical Automatic Identification System data, traffic departure-arrival areas are determined based on the Order Points to Identify the Clustering Structure algorithm and ship trajectories following the same itinerary are clustered. A maritime traffic network abstraction consisting of nodes that represent waypoint areas and navigational legs is constructed to represent the maritime traffic at a larger scale. Multinomial Logistic Regression and Gaussian Process regression models are developed and applied for predicting probabilistically the ships’ destinations and their trajectories along the ship route, respectively. Based on these models, the uncertainty on the ship's future position can be estimated given its current state. The proposed method is capable of long-term ship position prediction and provides information on the maritime traffic 10, 30 and 60 min ahead when the method is applied to all ships navigating in a study area.

"sensor information fusion architecture for virtual maritime environment","2012","This paper presents a ongoing research on generic sensor fusion architecture and its application to a maritime surveillance system. The importance of information fusion for various sensor types and specialized sensor fusion systems in various domains are discussed. In sensor fusion, centralized versus decentralized refers to where the fusion of the data occurs. In centralized fusion, the clients simply forward all of the data to a central location, and some entity at the central location is responsible for correlating and fusing the data. In this research we intend to correlate multiple maritime sensors such as RADAR, AIS, and other electronic object detection systems. Sri Lanka Navy has myriad of surveillance information sources such as AIS (Automatic Identification System), RADAR (Radio Aid Detection and Ranging), SONAR (Sound Navigation and Ranging), MSTT, HFSWR, AVL (Automatic Vessel Locating), HF Communication, Intelligence Data ect. So it is obvious that an information fusion methodology is needed to harness the effectiveness of multiple sensor information. An object identification pipeline is conceptualized such that an unknown object in the maritime domain is detected reducing the uncertainty of obtained information. The radical new virtual reality application has been developed to visualize the information fused from sensors and discussed in depth in addition to the introduction of the fusion process.

"long-term impact of continental and maritime airflow on aerosol environment and rain microstructure near landâ€“sea boundary","2022","The present study deals with the interplay of multiple atmospheric processes in changing the microphysical properties of precipitation during the pre-monsoon season (Marchâ€“May) using the long-term experimental data of raindrop size distributions (DSDs) spanning over 15 years (2005â€“2019) obtained at an urban tropical location, Kolkata (22.57Â°N, 88.37Â°E), near the landâ€“sea boundary. The changing pattern of air mass flows from the maritime and continental region, which contribute to the formation of precipitation processes, has been responsible for the varying characteristics of rain. Changes in raindrop sizes are related to aerosol properties, cloud features, temperature, and relative humidity that change mass-weighted mean drop diameter ( $D_{m}$ ) differently in low and high rain rate regimes.  $D_{m}$  has shown an increasing trend over time for low rain rates (< 15 mm/h), but a decreasing trend for high rain rate regimes (â‰¥15 mm/h). An increase (decrease) in mean temperature (relative humidity) below the atmospheric boundary layer (< 1.6 km) has enhanced the evaporation of small raindrops and altered rain microphysical features. Based on satellite observations, it has been found that the increasing aerosol optical depth (AOD) has been accompanied by an increase in cloud effective radius (CER), resulting in the anti-Twomey effect, which is due to the dominance of maritime influence over continental activities. Because of the predominant maritime activities, sea salt aerosols have a greater presence, causing an increase in CER, which consequently prevents raindrops from becoming large enough before they fall, thereby reducing  $D_{m}$  at high rainfall rates.","sea salt aerosols,clouds,continental region,rain,altered rain microphysical features,temperature,cloud features,rain drop sizes,atmospheric optics,atmospheric boundary layer,Clouds,pre-monsoon season,continental activities,maritime airflow,change mass-weighted mean drop diameter,air mass,precipitation dynamics,aerosol properties,precipitation process,aerosol environment,raindrops,predominant maritime activities,rain microstructure,raindrop size distributions,high rainfall rates,Aerosols,atmospheric humidity,mean temperature,urban tropical location,raindrop sizes,maritime/continental airflow,maritime influence,low rain rates,high rain rate regimes,MODIS,Trajectory,aerosol optical depth,cloud effective radius,Ocean temperature,anthropogenic activities,Rain,changing pattern,Market research,monsoons,land-sea boundary,multiple atmospheric process,relative humidity,aerosols,atmospheric temperature,atmospheric techniques,"

"location estimation in a maritime environment using a monocular camera","2014","Maritime surveillance is a very important task in coastal areas, especially in harbour environments. The most popular such systems include components like Automatic Identification System (AIS) and Radar. Camera based visual surveillance can be used as an alternative to these systems in order to overcome the lacking features of them. Sea surface object detection and identification is a major need for such visual surveillance systems. Most of the current visual surveillance systems don't have the ability of identifying vessels in real time. A vessel can be identified using information from other systems, if the location of the vessel is identified. Location estimation of sea surface objects is mainly explored in this research. Video stream from a single geo stationary camera is used as the input; however camera properties are not used for any calculation. Mainly two distance measurements are considered and different approaches for estimating the distances are explored. Neural network approach gave considerably accurate results in vertical distance estimation and it was found that the shortest distance from camera to the object can be measured best using B-spline 3D curve fitting. Data taken from AIS is used for fitting curves and training neural network. After calculating distances, latitudes and longitudes are calculated. An evaluation has been done comparing the calculated values and the values obtained from AIS data using various statistical tests. There, the different approaches are compared and accuracy levels are described. Vessel identification is done comparing the estimated location and the available location information from AIS data.","sea surface object detection,vessel identification,distance measurement,marine navigation,Global Positioning System,statistical test,splines (mathematics),geostationary camera,Maritime,video stream,Distance Estimation,neural nets,monocular camera,ships,maritime surveillance,B-spline 3D curve fitting,object detection,location estimation,sea surface object identification,vertical distance estimation,curve fitting,maritime environment,neural network approach,video surveillance,Monocular Vision,Location Estimation,camera based visual surveillance,"
"a novel 3d non-stationary maritime wireless channel model","2022","In this paper, a novel 3-dimensional (3D) non-stationary geometry-based stochastic model (GBSM) is proposed to mimic the ship-to-ship multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication channels. To reflect the realistic maritime propagation environment, the effects of rough sea surface scattering and evaporation duct propagation are investigated in the proposed channel model. The model considers the movements of transmitter (Tx), receiver (Rx), and scatterers, and is capable of capturing the channel characteristics, including non-stationary characteristics, spatial consistency, location-dependent property, etc. Through taking the array cluster evolution into account, the proposed channel model can describe massive MIMO channels and can easily switch to conventional MIMO channel model by adjusting corresponding parameters. Based on the proposed model, key statistical properties like delay/angular/Doppler power spectrum density (PSD), space-time correlation function (STCF), stationary interval, and root mean square (RMS) Doppler/delay spreads in multi-scenarios are derived. The usefulness and accuracy of the proposed model are demonstrated by comparing theoretical results, simulation results, and corresponding measurement results.","Channel models,geometry,realistic maritime propagation environment,3D nonstationary maritime wireless channel model,Ducts,Solid modeling,channel characteristics,Sea measurements,massive MIMO channels,Maritime ship-to-ship communications,nonstationary geometry-based stochastic model,stationary interval,radiowave propagation,rough sea surface,Three-dimensional displays,evaporation duct propagation,space-time correlation function,3D non-stationary wireless channel,Extraterrestrial measurements,Doppler power spectrum density,root mean square Doppler spreads,Sea surface,wireless channels,GBSM,ship-to-ship multiple-input multiple-output communication channels,statistical characteristics,marine communication,nonstationary characteristics,radio receivers,vehicular ad hoc networks,MIMO communication,electromagnetic wave scattering,radio transmitters,"
"eloran: resilient positioning, navigation, and timing infrastructure in maritime areas","2020","Global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and localization technology have become highly compact and effective. Although GNSS has been proven to be vulnerable to jamming when the signal strength is weak, most vehicles rely on it for navigation. Compared to GNSS, enhanced Loran (eLoran) is more resistant to jamming and is recommended as a realistic alternative to GNSS. Therefore, South Korea embarked on an eLoran testbed development project to provide resilient navigation information for maritime users. The primary goal of this project was to demonstrate that the system can provide a 20-m position accuracy to the maritime user within a 30-km coverage of a differential Loran station. In this paper, we describe the development of the eLoran testbed implementation and the performance of its preliminary experimental results. To confirm the feasibility of the eLoran testbed performance, we installed an eLoran transmitter and two differential Loran stations and subsequently conducted a zero-baseline performance test at the Pyeongtaek differential Loran station with a new eLoran signal. We also conducted a survey to collect conventional Loran signals along the western and southern coastlines of South Korea. Our experimental results show that the eLoran system met the performance requirements of this project, as well as that the signal to noise ratio of the eLoran signals changed over the topographic characteristics of the propagation path.","differential Loran station,GNSS,eLoran testbed,signal processing,Monitoring,topographic characteristics,performance requirements,signal strength,Global Positioning System,enhanced Loran,Transmitters,Radio navigation,timing infrastructure,jamming,eLoran testbed performance,jamming resistant,South Korea,satellite navigation,southern coastlines,propagation path,maritime navigation,western coastlines,Pyeongtaek differential Loran station,eLoran transmitter,eLoran testbed implementation,maritime areas,eLoran signal,eLoran testbed development project,eLoran system,localization technology,resilient positioning,GNSS backup,zero-baseline performance test,global navigation satellite system,marine communication,maritime user,radio transmitters,resilient navigation information,Global navigation satellite system,resilient PNT,"

"maritime anomaly detection using gaussian process active learning","2012","A model of normal vessel behaviours is useful for detecting illegal, suspicious, or unsafe behaviour; such as vessel theft, drugs smuggling, people trafficking or poor sailing. This work presents a data-driven non-parametric Bayesian model, based on Gaussian Processes, to model normal shipping behaviour. This model is learned from Automatic Identification System (AIS) data and uses an Active Learning paradigm to select an informative subsample of the data to reduce the computational complexity of training. The resultant model allows a measure of normality to be calculated for each newly-observed transmission according to its velocity given its current latitude and longitude. Using this measure of normality, ships can be identified as potentially anomalous and prioritised for further investigation. The model performance is assessed by its ability to detect artificially generated AIS anomalies at locations around the United Kingdom. Finally, the model is demonstrated on case studies from artificial and real vessel data to detect anomalies in unusual tracks.","identification technology,data mining,automatic identification system data,data-driven nonparametric Bayesian model,Bayes methods,Marine vehicles,normal vessel behaviours,unsafe behaviour detection,informative data subsampling,Accuracy,illegal behaviour detection,Bayesian methods,sampling methods,real vessel data,Gaussian process active learning,United Kingdom,Data models,Gaussian processes,artificially generated AIS anomalies detection,maritime anomaly detection,artificial vessel data,training computational complexity,training,Training,behavioural sciences,computational complexity,normal shipping behaviour model,Computational modeling,suspicious behaviour detection,learning (artificial intelligence),newly-observed transmission,AIS data,"
"neural network-based automatic reconstruction of missing vessel trajectory data","2019","Automatic identification system (AIS) is an independent tracking system which has been widely utilized on ships to frequently broadcast the time-stamped vessel position reports. The generated massive AIS data can contribute to protecting maritime security and enhancing maritime transportation efficiency, such as maritime surveillance, anomaly detection and traffic route extraction, etc. However, the received AIS-based vessel trajectories commonly suffer from missing data due to network overload and bad weathers. To improve the quality of vessel trajectories for further researches, a two-step calculation method for vessel trajectory reconstruction is proposed in this work. In particular, the Random Forest method is introduced in the first step to automatically identify the missing position records within vessel trajectories. The missing data points could be accurately estimated from both theoretical and practical perspectives. The second step proposes a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based supervised learning method to reconstruct the vessel trajectories with missing AIS data. The LSTM-based reconstruction method is able to take full advantage of the similar geometrical features behind massive vessel trajectories. Experimental results have confirmed the superior performance of the proposed two-step method in terms of both effectiveness and robustness.","two-step calculation method,surveillance,missing position records,massive AIS data,LSTM-based reconstruction method,random forests,anomaly detection,transportation,Marine vehicles,trajectory reconstruction,maritime security,Random Forest method,long short-term memory-based supervised learning method,network overload,Radio frequency,Decision trees,neural nets,neural network-based automatic reconstruction,vessel trajectory data,ships,automatic identification system,marine safety,marine engineering,maritime surveillance,AIS-based vessel trajectories,trajectory data mining,time-stamped vessel position reports,Logic gates,massive vessel trajectories,Automatic identification system,missing AIS data,Trajectory,traffic route extraction,missing data points,vessel trajectory reconstruction,two-step method,independent tracking system,long short-term memory,maritime transportation efficiency,learning (artificial intelligence),tracking,bad weathers,"
"meteorological regimes modulating dust outbreaks in southwest asia: the role of pressure anomaly and inter-tropical convergence zone on the 1–3 july 2014 case","2015","The present work examines the characteristics (source regions, pathways, vertical profiles) as well as the meteorological conditions and the role of the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) during a dust event on 1–3 July 2014 over southwest (SW) Asia. NCEP/NCAR reanalysis, meteorological and satellite remote sensing (MODIS, Meteosat, CALIPSO) observations are utilized. The major dust storm (AOD550 up to 1.5–2.0) was generated in the southern Karakum desert in Turkmenistan as a result of intense north winds (Levar), due to enhanced pressure gradient between the Caspian Sea and Hindu Kush Mountains. The dust storm was vertically extended up to 5km over the arid terrain of SW Asia, as a consequence of the deep mixing layer and increased convection, while over northern Arabian Sea it was mixed with another dust plume coming from Arabia and marine aerosols due to strong monsoon winds within the boundary layer. The regional topography, variations in pressure, monsoon circulation and the position of the ITCZ play a decisive role on modulation of the wind field, dust-storm pathways and vertical distribution of dust. Enhanced knowledge of atmospheric circulation and processes responsible for dust export over SW Asia and Arabian Sea in linkage to the Levar wind and Indian summer monsoon is essential for improving dust forecasts and simulations over the region.","MSLP anomalies,SW Asia,ITCZ position,Dust storm,Karakum desert,Vertical dust distribution,"

In addition, the messages contain erroneous data and undergo spoofing attacks.

"sampling-based path planning for cooperative autonomous maritime vehicles to reduce uncertainty in range-only localization","2019","The following letter presents an adaptive path planning algorithm for cooperative localization in the maritime environment. It considers the scenario where an Autonomous Surface Vehicle (ASV) acts as a Communication and Navigation Aid (CNA) to support Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) with range measurements. As AUVs have no access to GPS while submerged, range measurements can bind the otherwise continuously growing navigational error. This can be done by methods such as range-only Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). In such methods, the resulting uncertainty and positional error depends on the geometry between transmitter (CNA) and receiver (AUV). This letter proposes a planning algorithm that combines priority based expansion of a search tree with random sampling-based exploration to position the CNA at strategic positions to transmit ranging messages at optimal times to reduce the uncertainty and error at the AUVsâ€™ position. The approach is validated and shows an increased confidence for AUVsâ€™ localization in simulated environments as well as real experiments using a dataset gathered from AUV Sirius.","Robot localization,cooperating robots,Path planning,Uncertainty,Autonomous underwater vehicles,Acoustic communication,localization,Navigation,motion and path planning,Motion planning,marine robotics,"

"climate change impacts on tropical cyclones and extreme sea levels in the south pacific — a regional assessment","2012","This paper reviews the current understanding of the effect of climate change on extreme sea levels in the South Pacific region. This region contains many locations that are vulnerable to extreme sea levels in the current climate, and projections indicate that this vulnerability will increase in the future. The recent publication of authoritative statements on the relationship between global warming and global sea level rise, tropical cyclones and the El Niño-Southern Oscillation phenomenon has motivated this review. Confident predictions of global mean sea level rise are modified by regional differences in the steric (density-related) component of sea level rise and changing gravitational interactions between the ocean and the ice sheets which affect the regional distribution of the eustatic (mass-related) contribution to sea level rise. The most extreme sea levels in this region are generated by tropical cyclones. The intensity of the strongest tropical cyclones is likely to increase, but many climate models project a substantial decrease in tropical cyclone numbers in this region, which may lead to an overall decrease in the total number of intense tropical cyclones. This projection, however, needs to be better quantified using improved high-resolution climate model simulations of tropical cyclones. Future changes in ENSO may lead to large regional variations in tropical cyclone incidence and sea level rise, but these impacts are also not well constrained. While storm surges from tropical cyclones give the largest sea level extremes in the parts of this region where they occur, other more frequent high sea level events can arise from swell generated by distant storms. Changes in wave climate are projected for the tropical Pacific due to anthropogenically-forced changes in atmospheric circulation. Future changes in sea level extremes will be caused by a combination of changes in mean sea level, regional sea level trends, tropical cyclone incidence and wave climate. Recommendations are given for research to increase understanding of the response of these factors to climate change. Implications of the results for adaptation research are also discussed.","sea level,ENSO,tropical cyclones,South Pacific,Climate change,"

Therefore, the research of airborne ISAR ship target imaging is very important. Firstly, the working principle of airborne ISAR system is summarized, and the key problems faced by airborne ISAR system are analyzed.

"improving maritime traffic emission estimations on missing data with crbms","2020","Maritime traffic emissions are a major concern to governments as they heavily impact the Air Quality in coastal cities. Ships use the Automatic Identification System (AIS) to continuously report position and speed among other features, and therefore this data is suitable to be used to estimate emissions, if it is combined with engine data. However, important ship features are often inaccurate or missing. State-of-the-art complex systems, like CALIOPE at the Barcelona Supercomputing Center, are used to model Air Quality. These systems can benefit from AIS based emission models as they are very precise in positioning the pollution. Unfortunately, these models are sensitive to missing or corrupted data, and therefore they need data curation techniques to significantly improve the estimation accuracy. In this work, we propose a methodology for treating ship data using Conditional Restricted Boltzmann Machines (CRBMs) plus machine learning methods to improve the quality of data passed to emission models that can also be applied to other GPS and time-series problems. Results show that we can improve the default methods proposed to cover missing data. In our results, we observed that using our method the models boosted their accuracy to detect otherwise undetectable emissions. In particular, we used a real data-set of AIS data, provided by the Spanish Port Authority, to estimate that thanks to our method, the model was able to detect 45% of additional emissions, representing 152 tonnes of pollutants per week in Barcelona and propose new features that may enhance emission modeling.","CRBM,Data cleaning,Emission modeling,AIS,GPS,Ship time series,"

The proposed method decides for each trajectory point if the vessel is anomalous, considering longitude, latitude, speed and direction.

Voluntary broadcasts of vessel position and velocity via AIS are received and decoded, and compared with SAR observations to verify the data and identify potentially non-cooperative vessels. Limited transmit power and downlink time will dictate that data be processed onboard the spacecraft.

"a biogeochemical orientation survey in the moisan gold-mineralized area, haenam district in korea","2011","A biogeochemical orientation survey was carried out in the vicinity of an epithermal Au deposit in the Moisan Au–Ag mineralized area, Haenam district in Korea. The Au–Ag bearing quartz veins of the mine occur as narrow open-space fillings within Cretaceous silicic pyroclastics. The vein minerals consist mainly of quartz, sericite, pyrite, chalcopyrite, and galena, with some electrum and argentite. The main objectives of this study were to study the geochemical characteristics of rocks, soils and plants in this area, to investigate the spatial relationship between Au and associated elements in rock–soil–plant system, and to evaluate the applicability of biogeochemical prospecting for Au vein occurrences in Korea. Samples of rocks and soils, and leaves of three plant species (Japanese red pine — P. densiflora, oriental white oak — Q. aliena, Japanese mallotus — M. japonicus) were collected from the target mineralized area and control barren locations, and analyzed for trace elements by instrumental neutron activation analysis. Sampling lines were composed of one slope line which is almost parallel to the mineralized quartz-veins, and four transect lines spaced 100m apart across the veins at 20m sampling intervals. From the multi-element data of rock samples (n=9), high values of Au (maximum 2030ppb) are spatially related to Au–quartz veins. Soil samples (n=61) collected from five sampling lines show higher values of Au (24–825ppb) whereas soil samples from the control locations have lower values of Au (below 25ppb). Many plant species collected from the vicinity of the veins have high Au contents compared with those at the control locations, but the ranges of Au values are variable among plant species. In a total of 128 samples of plant leaves, Q. aliena yielded Au values of 0.4 to 6.9ppb, and M. japonicus 0.9 to 4.1ppb. Gold contents in P. densiflora ranged from 0.1 to 5.6ppb. Plant leaves from control areas show less than 1.6ppb Au. The biological absorption coefficient (BAC) of Au in plants decreases in the order of Q. aliena>M. japonicus>P. densiflora. Based on the results of the study, Q. aliena appeared to be the best sampling media for biogeochemical prospecting of Au in the study area.","Au anomaly,Biogeochemical survey,Gold–quartz veins,"

"a multivariate logic decision support system for optimization of the maritime routes","2017","In recent years, maritime freight transportation and the consequent handling of containers are among the most dynamic and growing sectors. The aim of this research is to propose a Decision Support System (DSS) addressed mainly to shipping companies, allowing the choice, even en-route, of the hub port of destination for the successive multi-modal operations. The companies make choices in relation both to the ship location and to a dynamic accessibility indicator. The accessibility indicator is generally accepted as the parameter that better represents the interactions between a port and its hinterland. Different factors can influence the accessibility in maritime transport; some of them are characterized by low variability, while others show a high within-day dynamics. For example, the technical characteristics of ports (number of berths and their depths, number of cranes, storage area, etc.) belong to the first group; instead, the number of free berths, the delay time in freight loading and unloading operations, and weather conditions can change during the day. Their variability can be evaluated by a real-time monitoring, while the ship location can be easily obtained by GPS and radar signals. In the proposed DSS, we have considered data about the technical characteristics of ports and, depending on the request coming from ships, acquires the dynamic characteristics of each port, the ship location and the destination area. After the completion of the process, the DSS provides as output the port â€œcloserâ€ to the requests expressed by the users. Since some current values of both the dynamic characteristics of ports and information provided by shipping companies are subject to uncertainty, we proposed a DSS based on a multivariate accessibility indicator.","decision support systems,accessibility indicator,unloading operations,dynamic accessibility indicator,Transportation,dynamic characteristics,Ports (Computers),freight loading,transportation,Marine vehicles,Companies,goods distribution,radar signals,decision support system,ship location,multivariate logic decision support system,growing sectors,marine systems,shipping companies,maritime transportation,maritime transport,freight containers,Data models,maritime freight transportation,containers,Real-time systems,GPS,Decision support systems,multimodal operations,DSS,optimization,maritime routes,dynamic sectors,real-time monitoring,production engineering computing,"
"chapter 56 - tin","2015","Inorganic tin compounds occur naturally in the Earth’s crust. In the environment, tin can be found in both inorganic and organic forms. Inorganic tin compounds are released from natural and anthropogenic sources. The conversion of metallic tin forms to compounds that may be more soluble increases the risk of exposure and toxicity. Organotin compounds in the environment largely originate from anthropogenic activities. However, chemical and biochemical methylation reactions convert inorganic tin compounds into methyltin form. Biomethylation of alkyltins results in the accumulation of more toxic organotin compounds. Tin is not regarded an essential nutrient for humans. However, tin is considered an essential for the growth of rats, with a requirement for tin of between 1 and 2mg/kg in the diet. Elemental tin, inorganic tin compounds, and long-chain alkyltins are poorly absorbed when ingested, which accounts for their relatively low toxicity. The toxicity of organotin compounds depends on the length of alkyl chain, hydrophobicity, and other physicochemical properties. Hydrophobic organotins are toxic to a wide variety of organisms owing to their high solubility in cell membranes. The alkyl tins are more toxic than the aryl tins, whereas the toxicity of short-chain alkyltin compounds such as trimethyl- and triethyltin is higher than that of long-chain compounds: toxicity increases with number of alkyl groups. The excretory routes of tin compounds may vary depending of the type of compounds and the mode of exposure. Insoluble inorganic tin compounds are largely nontoxic. However, inhalation of tin dust results in its deposition in lungs and may cause “stannosis,” a benign pneumoconiosis. Some tin salts are irritating or can liberate toxic fumes during decomposition. Gastrointestinal absorption of soluble tin salts is only a few percent of the ingested dose. In chronic exposure, tin tends to accumulate in kidney, liver, and bones. Bones comprise a major site of deposition of tin after long-term exposure and intramuscular injection. The biological half-life of tin in bone is approximately 100 days. Exposure to high concentrations of inorganic tin may cause gastrointestinal illness, as well as liver and kidney problems. No noteworthy histopathological observations of nonneoplastic nature were reported in a long-term study. Short-chain alkyls are easily absorbed from gastrointestinal tract. Some alkyltin compounds, particularly tributyltin and triphenyltin, have high toxicity. Chronic exposure to butyltin compounds causes imposex, a pathological condition characterized by development of male sex characteristics in female gastropods. Toxicity of organotins in humans is most frequently reported as loss of memory and seizure, as well as other symptoms including death. Short-chain alkyltin, particularly the trialkyl derivatives, and aromatic tin compounds are neurotoxic. Hydrophobic trimethyltin and triethyltin compounds readily diffuse into richly lipophilic tissues such as brain and cause encephalopathy, cerebral edema, and severe seizures. Tetraalkyltins are enzymatically converted to the trisubstituted form and exert delayed but similar neurotoxic effects. Tributyltin compounds are less toxic than trimethyl- and triethyltins. They may be strongly irritating to the skin in humans. It was reported that shipyard workers exposed to tributyltin oxide developed severe dermatitis, difficulty in breathing, and flu-like symptoms. Trisubstituted organotin derivatives are implicated in hepatotoxicity, immunodeficiency, endocrine disruption, and both reproductive anomalies and infertility in laboratory animals. Monobutyltin and dibutyltin show genotoxicity, while mono- and dimethyltin are not genotoxic. Organotin compounds penetrate the cell membrane and interrupt oxidative phosphorylation, disturb calcium homeostasis, damage mitochondria, and induce apoptosis.","biocompatibility,detection methods,mechanism of toxicity,metabolism,organotins,risk assessment,tin,environment,"

"modeling and application of global maritime transport accessibility based on probability distribution","2023","The study of sea area accessibility is often overlooked despite the fact that vessel routesâ€™ density at sea can reflect human activity patterns. Using AIS point data for 2014 and 2018, this paper constructed global daily vessel routes and applied the kernel density estimation method to obtain the probability distribution function of route density for over 700,000 sea grids under a global 0.25Â° regular grid. An accessibility model for sea areas was then proposed and applied to the grid, resulting in the accessibility assessment of global sea areas in 2014 and 2018. The results indicated that the average global maritime accessibility value increased from 5.2% in 2014 to 14.4% in 2018. Accessibility to various international trade routes, such as those through the Cape of Good Hope and polar regions, significantly increased. However, accessibility to sea areas such as the Mediterranean and sea areas near the Pacific Islands decreased. This study explored the temporal and spatial variation of maritime traffic accessibility, which could enhance our understanding of global vessel activity characteristics and guide maritime rescue resource allocation, marine species protection, and marine spatial planning.","AD 2018,kernel density estimation method,Kernel,global sea areas,Marine vehicles,regular grid,accessibility assessment,Accessibility,sea grids,kernel density estimation,Maritime communications,AD 2014,Spatial databases,route density,maritime transport,AIS,Seaports,Density measurement,average global maritime accessibility value,maritime traffic accessibility,Probability distribution,probability distribution function,Artificial intelligence,Cape of Good Hope,global daily vessel routes,international trade routes,global vessel activity characteristics,Trajectory,human activity patterns,global maritime transport accessibility,accessibility model,sea area accessibility,Estimation,AIS point data,oceanographic techniques,"
"modelling dynamic maritime traffic complexity with radial distribution functions","2021","The identification of maritime traffic complexity is important to guide maritime surveillance operators towards the more critical areas for the real-time monitoring of the maritime traffic situation. To identify and map the traffic complexity effectively, this paper proposes a dynamic maritime traffic complexity model based on radial distribution functions. For modelling the traffic complexity, three sub complexity models are established first by addressing the speed, course and position of the ships. For each sub-model, the main variable is used for building the radial distribution function model, and a variation method is used to estimate the complexity. Finally, the overall traffic complexity can be identified and mapped by synthesizing the results from the three sub-models. The AIS data in the northern Yellow Sea of China is used for validating the proposed model. The results show that the proposed model can effectively identify the traffic complexity in the studied sea area, and have an advantage in some special sea area compared with the previous traffic complexity model. By applying the proposed model, maritime surveillance operators can better monitor the real-time traffic situation and improve their working efficiency, which are crucial for the improvement of navigational safety.","AIS data,Navigational safety,Maritime traffic complexity,Radial distribution function,"
"analyzing congestion interdependencies of ports and container ship routes in the maritime network infrastructure","2018","Events, such as prolonged congestion in ports or unavailable ship routes in the maritime network, often initiate cascading congestions that block transportation and/or disrupt services over wide areas. Existing traffic flow analysis methods lack the ability to understand the cascading effects of delays in ship routes or how to reduce overall delays in greater maritime areas. Dependency risk graphs have been proposed as a tool for analyzing such cascading events using dependency chains. This paper proposes a risk-based interdependency analysis method capable to detect large-scale traffic congestions between interconnected ports and ship routes in the maritime network and provide solutions to improve flow. Presented dependency risk chains of ports along with graph theory help us analyze ship routes and detect ports that are affected most when other major ports are congested in the maritime network, detect the causes of bottlenecks, and provide valuable info in relieving delays across container ship routes. We apply the proposed method on historical container ship routing data provided by the MarineTraffic company that maintains a comprehensive maritime database worldwide for more than six million users monthly. This application-oriented, interdisciplinary effort culminated in a prototype tool is able to analyze the historical data for container ships in the entire global maritime network and detect congestion dependencies. The tool can be used to identify key shipping routes or ports that: 1) are prone to delays; 2) greatly affect the overall maritime network due to position, connections and risk of congestion; and/or 3) get affected the most by delays in previous route legs.","maritime database worldwide,cascading effects,Transportation,telecommunication network routing,graph,congestion interdependency analysis,centrality,vehicle routing,interconnected ports,transportation,Marine vehicles,sector,Delays,Mathematical model,Maritime,infrastructure,cascading,delay,Containers,ships,dependency risk chains,container,risk-based interdependency analysis method,dependency,flow,congestion,MarineTraffic company,impact,global maritime network infrastructure,sea ports,historical container ship routing data,containers,traffic flow analysis methods,graph theory,large-scale traffic congestion detection,risk,marine communication,Tools,route,Analytical models,port,"
"a merchant ship thermo-salinograph network in the pacific ocean","1996","The need for better knowledge of sea surface salinity (SSS) and sea surface temperature (SST) distribution in the tropical oceans was brought to light during the 10 years of the TOGA programme (1985–1994). In order to improve on the original “meteorological bucket” method of sampling, we developed a network of merchant ships among those operating regular routes through the tropical Pacific, and equipped them with thermo-salinographs. Accurate positioning of the ships was obtained using a satellite positioning system. High frequency sampling (every 15 s) and recording of the median values for every 5 min resulted in quite precise monitoring of the SST and SSS, and in a description of the salinity fronts along the routes followed by the ships. Using this equipment, we were able to detect the influence of local rainfall on salinity and temperature and the diurnal cycle of sea surface temperature. The accuracy of salinity measurements (0.02) was better than that of the old sampling technique by one order of magnitude. Temperature measurement by the thermo-salinograph was very stable but yielded results that are 0.2–0.3°C higher than sea surface temperature. To ensure reliability of data, the equipment was carefully checked every time the ships called at Noumea (i.e. every 2–3 months), and re-calibration every year or two is essential.",""
"tracing illegal oil discharges from vessels using sar and ais in bohai sea of china","2021","In China's 14th Five-Year Plan, it is necessary to coordinate the promotion of marine ecological protection and prevent environmental risks such as marine oil spills. The illegal discharge of oily waste from ships is an important source of oil spill pollution in the Bohai Sea, and has become an important factor hindering the purification of the marine environment. Because SAR remote sensing is not restricted by light conditions, it can work at night, in heavy fog, overcast and rainy days, and has become one of the important techniques for monitoring oil spills on the sea. AIS can provide real-time and historical position and track information of ships. The combination of SAR and AIS can provide a great help for maritime regulatory authorities to find the source of oil spill pollution. However, China has not yet established a mature and effective oil spill supervision system based on SAR and AIS. This paper proposes a framework for oil spill detection and accountability using the combination of SAR, AIS and boarding inspection, and takes an example of the monitoring and tracking process of illegal oil discharge from a ship in the Bohai Sea. As far as we know, this is the first time that China has used SAR and AIS to identify ships that illegally discharge oily sewage. This work framework can provide a reference for China's maritime agencies to improve the oil spill supervision system during the 14th Five-Year Plan.","Synthetic aperture radar,Illegal discharge,Automatic identification system,Oil spill,"
"detecting maneuvers in maritime observation data with cusum","2017","Understanding and building suitable marine traffic and prediction models is a difficult undertaking. To build such a model, it is necessary to understand vessels behavior and have knowledge about the driving patterns. In general, a complex dynamic model for several ship types is used. Maritime sensors like AIS or radar do not always provide the necessary information, like vessel size or type. That is why a simpler solution for detecting maneuvers in maritime observation data is needed. We present a light approach to detect maneuver in maritime observation data without information about the vessel dynamic. For the maneuver detection, we use the CUSUM method which is normally be used in change point detection and use it for geospatial data.

"traffic pattern detection using the hough transformation for anomaly detection to improve maritime domain awareness","2014","Techniques for extracting traffic patterns from ship position data to generate atlases of expected ocean travel are developed in this paper. An archive of historical data is used to develop a traffic density grid. The Hough transformation is used to extract linear patterns of elevated density from the traffic density grid, which can be considered the â€œhighwaysâ€ of the oceans. These highways collectively create an atlas that is used to define geographical regions of expected ship locations. The atlas generation techniques are demonstrated using automated information system (AIS) ship position data to detect highways in both open-ocean and coastal areas. Additionally, the atlas generation techniques are used to explore variability in ship traffic as a result of extreme weather.

"two-stage offloading optimization for energyâ€“latency tradeoff with mobile edge computing in maritime internet of things","2020","The ever-increasing growth in maritime activities with large amounts of Maritime Internet-of-Things (M-IoT) devices and the exploration of ocean network leads to a great challenge for dealing with a massive amount of maritime data in a cost-effective and energy-efficient way. However, the resources-constrained maritime users cannot meet the high requirements of transmission delay and energy consumption, due to the excessive traffic and limited resources in maritime networks. To solve this problem, mobile edge computing is taken as a promising paradigm to help mobile devices from edge servers via computation offloading considering the different quality of service (QoS) with the complex ocean environments, resulting in energy saving and increased transmission latency. To investigate the tradeoff between latency and energy consumption in low-cost large-scale maritime communication, we formulate the offloading optimization problem and propose a two-stage joint optimal offloading algorithm, optimizing computation and communication resource allocation under limited energy and sensitive latency. At the first stage, the maritime users make the decision on whether to offload a computation considering their demands and environments. Then, the channel allocation and power allocation problems were proposed to optimize the offloading policy which coordinates with the center cloud servers at the second stage, considering the dynamic tradeoff of latency and energy consumption. Finally, numerical simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.","offloading strategies,telecommunication power management,channel allocation,computation offloading,maritime data,limited resources,ocean network,dynamic tradeoff,two-stage joint optimal offloading algorithm,energy-efficiency,resources-constrained maritime users,QoS,Internet of Things,quality of service,Marine vehicles,Maritime Internet-of-Things,Resource management,large-scale maritime communication,mobile edge computing (MEC),two-stage offloading optimization,Servers,Energy???latency tradeoff,cloud computing,maritime networks,Oceans,optimisation,communication resource allocation,mobile computing,mobile edge computing,energy-latency tradeoff,offloading policy,maritime Internet of Things (M-IoT),network traffic,energy saving,transmission delay,telecommunication traffic,complex ocean environments,energy consumption,mobile devices,Cloud computing,marine communication,power allocation problems,cloud server,offloading optimization problem,Task analysis,maritime activities,resource allocation,edge servers,M-IoT devices,"

"event-triggered cooperative formation control for autonomous surface vehicles under the maritime search operation","2022","To improve the autonomy of maritime search and rescue (SAR) operation, this paper concentrates on the formation control problem for autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) with the limited communication resource. A novel parallel search guidance, considering the maneuvering characteristics of ASVs, is developed to guide the formation to execute the automatic SAR operation. That can guarantee that the corresponding guidance law is highly efficient, self-driving and suitable for the large-scale formation. Combined with the guidance principle, a formation control algorithm is proposed by fuse of the event-triggered control and neural networks (NNs). In the proposed scheme, the gain uncertainty of actuators is effectively compensated requiring no prior information around the model structure. Unlike the existing results, the proposed event-triggered mechanism can activate synchronously both the controller and the NNs weight estimator.

"noma-based uav communications for maritime coverage enhancement","2021","The lack of communication infrastructure in the ocean inevitably leads to coverage blind zones. In addition to high-throughput marine satellites, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be used to provide coverage for these blind zones along with onshore base stations. In this paper, we consider the use of UAV for maritime coverage enhancement. Particularly, to serve more ships on the vast oceanic area with limited spectrum resources, we employ non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). A joint power and transmission duration allocation problem is formulated to maximize the minimum ship throughput, with the constraints on onboard communication energy. Different from previous works, we only assume the slowly time-varying large-scale channel state information (CSI) to reduce the system cost, as the large-scale CSI is location-dependent and can be obtained according to a priori radio map. To solve the non-convex problem, we decompose it into two subproblems and solve them in an iterative way.

"a fast sar image position algorithm for maritime target location","2016","In order to find the maritime targets location in SAR image accurately, a fast R-D algorithm is introduced in this paper and it can solve targets location problems which are in the sea area. The real latitude and longitude coordinates measure system and geographical coordinates are built up for SAR image, then the targets located in the sea can be point out. First, based on information in SAR satellite data headers the Doppler center frequency coefficients can be calculated. Then the parameters are carried in the R-D pattern for calculate four vertex coordinates of SAR image. Generally the solution of R-D pattern is an iterative process, here a fast algorithm is proposed which combined with slope distance, Doppler parameters and earth model to reduce variables, then and the position of SAR is calculated and the latitude and longitude coordinates of target is also obtained. Second, the SAR image geocoding can be made up and the target in SAR image over sea can be found out. Finally, compare these results with AIS data, the accuracy of location is analyzed. The result shows that the deviation of distance location is less than 200 meters, and the deviation of azimuth is less than 6'. The error is reasonable for real application.

"developments in controlled green-water larval culture technologies for estuarine fishes in queensland, australia and elsewhere","2007","Since 1989, researchers with the Department of Primary Industries and Fisheries (DPI&F) in Queensland, Australia, have successfully used controlled low-water exchange green-water cultures to rear the larvae of estuarine fishes and crustaceans through to metamorphosis. High survivals and excellent fry condition have been achieved for several commercially important endemic species produced for various projects. They include barramundi or sea bass, Lates calcarifer, Australian bass, Macquaria novemaculeata, dusky flathead, Platycephalus fuscus, sand whiting, Sillago ciliata, red sea bream or snapper, Pagrus auratus, banana prawn, Fenneropenaeus merguiensis, and others. The consistent success of our standardised and relatively simple approach at different localities has led to it being incorporated into general fingerling production practices at several establishments in Australia. Although post-metamorphosis rearing methods have differed for each species investigated, due to various biological and behavioural traits and project requirements, these larval rearing methods have been successful with few species-specific modifications. Initially modelled on the Taiwanese approach to rearing Penaeids in aerated low-water exchange cultures, the approach similarly appears to rely on a beneficial assemblage of micro-organisms. Conceptually, these micro-organisms may include a mixture of the air-borne primary invaders of pure phytoplankton cultures when exposed to outdoor conditions. Whilst this would vary with different sites, our experiences with these methods have consistently been favourable. Mass microalgal cultures with eco-physiological youth are used to regularly augment larval fish cultures so that rearing conditions simulate an exponential growth-phase microalgal bloom. Moderate to heavy aeration prevents settlement of particulate matter and encourages aerobic bacterial decomposition of wastes. The green-water larval rearing approach described herein has demonstrated high practical utility in research and commercial applications, and has greatly simplified marine finfish hatchery operations whilst generally lifting production capacities for metamorphosed fry in Australia. Its potential uses in areas of aquaculture other than larviculture are also discussed.","Shrimp,Green water,Fish,Larviculture,Mesocosm,"

"lagrangian analysis of multi-satellite data in support of open ocean marine protected area design","2017","Compared to ecosystem conservation in territorial seas, protecting the open ocean has peculiar geopolitical, economic and scientific challenges. One of the major obstacle is defining the boundary of an open ocean Marine Protected Area (MPA). In contrast to coastal ecosystems, which are mostly constrained by topographic structures fixed in time, the life of marine organisms in the open ocean is entrained by fluid dynamical structures like eddies and fronts, whose lifetime occurs on ecologically-relevant timescales. The position of these highly dynamical structures can vary interannually by hundreds of km, and so too will regions identified as ecologically relevant such as the foraging areas of marine predators. Thus, the expected foraging locations suggested from tracking data cannot be directly extrapolated beyond the year in which the data were collected. Here we explore the potential of Lagrangian methods applied to multisatellite data as a support tool for a MPA proposal by focusing on the Crozet archipelago oceanic area (Indian Sector of the Southern Ocean). By combining remote sensing with biologging information from a key marine top predator (Eudyptes chrysolophus, or Macaroni penguin) of the Southern Ocean foodweb, we identify a highly dynamic branch of the Subantarctic front as a foraging hotspot. By tracking this feature in historical satellite data (1993–2012) we are able to extrapolate the position of this foraging ground beyond the years in which tracking data are available and study its spatial variability.",""
"use of noma for maritime communication networks with p-df relaying channel","2020","In this paper, a partial de-code-and-forward (P-DF) cooperative relaying network (CRN) with non-orthogonal multiple access (P-DF-CRN-NOMA) for maritime space communications is proposed. Without loss of generality, three kinds of relay forwarding protocols are studied to characterize the superiority of the proposed P-DF-CRN-NOMA scheme, where, after receptions from the coastal base station (BS), the island relay forwards the successful decoded symbols to the ship user to avoid the performance loss provided by the high decoding requirement in decode-and-forward (DF). To further improve the system performance, as well as for a fairness comparison, the maximum ratio combining (MRC) is utilized at the ship user. Specifically, to present the impact of the channel qualities, the scenarios of the weak and strong links that from the source to destination (S-D) are both considered. The closed-form expressions for the outage probability of the P-DF-CRN-NOMA are derived considering the three proposed forwarding cases.

"probabilistic associative learning of vessel motion patterns at multiple spatial scales for maritime situation awareness","2007","An improved neurobiologically inspired algorithm for situation awareness in the maritime domain is presented, which takes real-time tracking information and learns motion pattern models on-the- fly, enabling the models to adapt well to evolving situations while maintaining high levels of performance. The constantly refined models, resulting from concurrent incremental learning, are used to evaluate the behavior patterns of vessels based on their present motion states. Improvement to the associative learning law for learning temporal associations between vessel events enables conditional probabilities between events to be learned incrementally and locally. This allows weights in the learned model to be interpreted more readily, enabling better location prediction performance. Improvement in prediction performance is achieved by using multiple spatial scales to represent position, enabling the most relevant spatial scale to be used for local vessel behavior. Features and performance of these updates to the learning system using recorded data are described.","learning temporal associations,probabilistic associative learning,maritime,neural networks,Neural networks,Situation awareness,Predictive models,Learning systems,multiple spatial scales,data recording,real-time tracking information,marine engineering,Performance analysis,Training data,learning,Real time systems,Information technology,Tracking,conditional probabilities,maritime situation awareness,concurrent incremental learning,learning (artificial intelligence),Event detection,Terrorism,prediction,vessel motion patterns,"
"decision support scheduling for maritime search and rescue planning with a system of uavs and fuel service stations","2015","When maritime accidents occur, search and rescue (SAR) operations for survivors are a top priority. To conduct the SAR, a fleet of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can be used. The objective of the search task is to maximize the probability of locating targets. The goal of the rescue task is to follow survivors, transmit their location and status to the command center, and await the rescue team. In maritime SAR, the priority of a survivor being in a particular location changes with time due to current and wind. For persistent SAR operations with a system of UAVs, it is beneficial to simultaneously orchestrate the activities of multiple UAVs and fuel service stations. To address these problems, we develop a mixed integer linear program (MILP) capable of generating efficient search and rescue operation plans. For real time operations that account for unanticipated changes to the system parameters, a rolling horizon scheduling approach may be used. The MILP model is functionally capable of incorporation in such a system.","unmanned aerial vehicles,marine accidents,rescue task,system parameters,real time operations,multi-robot systems,Planning,integer programming,maritime SAR,marine safety,search task,search and rescue operation plans,UAV fleet,SAR operations,rescue robots,Real-time systems,maritime search and rescue planning,autonomous aerial vehicles,Indexes,linear programming,rolling horizon scheduling approach,rescue team,Unmanned aerial vehicles,Trajectory,search and rescue operations,Sensors,fuel service stations,maritime accidents,targets location probability,mixed integer linear program,MILP model,Fuels,decision support scheduling,"
"autonomous maritime landings for low-cost vtol aerial vehicles","2014","Autonomous landing of quad rotor UAV on a maritime vessel is a challenging task, as low cost sensors, unknown movements of the landing surface, and external disturbances make it difficult to generate a relative pose estimate with sufficient accuracy for landing. In this work, we propose an architecture that avoids sensor limitations while allowing for accurate relative pose estimation, even in the presence of wind disturbances. The final landing sequence is performed entirely in the body-fixed inertial frame so that noisy measurements from the GPS and magnetometer sensors do not degrade the relative estimation accuracy.

"pitting corrosion identification approach based on inverse finite element method for marine structure applications","2023","This paper presents a state-of-the art inverse finite element method (iFEM) for full-field, real-time structural health monitoring (SHM) of corroding structures. The study focuses on detecting the location and identifying the extent of pitting corrosion, which is one of the most hazardous forms of corrosion due to the difficulties regarding its prediction and detection. For this purpose, high-fidelity finite element (FE) models of corroded samples with complex-shaped, semi-ellipsoidal, and cylindroconical defects are developed to replicate the strain field of pitting corroded structures. The strain fields produced by the FE models, verified against experimental data, are reconstructed by the iFEM model using a robust and practical four-node quadrilateral inverse-shell element, iQS4. A strain-based damage criterion is defined to obtain the damage distribution and the location of corrosion pits on dog-bone tensile test samples with full sensor iFEM and coupled iFEM-GA reduced sensor technique. Finally, in a practical example of a structure with complex geometry, the proposed method's performance is assessed through detecting the location of corrosion damage on a cylindrical marine structure with axial stiffeners.","Structural health monitoring,Marine structures,Corrosion damage detection,Inverse finite element,"
"data-driven financial and operational risk management: empirical evidence from the global tramp shipping industry","2022","The global shipping industry has long suffered from high volatilities in freight rates and bunker fuel prices that lead to significant earnings risks. This paper aims to investigate the effectiveness of financial hedging and operational risk management strategies of 31 world leading tramp shipping companies through a Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) model using various data sources. Operational risk management strategies are categorized into long-term (e.g., fleet diversity and fleet age) and short-to-medium-term (e.g., relative trip distance, fleet repositioning flexibility, and trading diversity) strategies. We innovatively quantify the short-to-medium-term operational risk management strategies using Automatic Identification System (AIS) data. The results show that financial hedging can effectively reduce bunker fuel price risk exposure but cannot reduce freight rate risk exposure. Meanwhile, companies can use operational risk management strategies to effectively reduce both risk exposures. This study provides significant implications for shipping risk management.","Financial hedging,Data analytics,Operational risk management,Bayesian belief network,Big data in shipping,Shipping risk management,"
"impact evaluation of the industrial activities in the bay of bakar (adriatic sea, croatia): recent benthic foraminifera and heavy metals","2013","The Bay of Bakar is one of the most heavily polluted bays at the Eastern Adriatic. Three major industrial companies potentially endanger the bay. The concentration of major, minor and trace elements in surface sediments from thirteen stations was discussed in relation to the sediment type and foraminiferal assemblages. The distribution of major elements in the bay is influenced by geological nature of surroundings. Heavy metal distribution depends on pollution sources and on amount of mud fraction: fine-grained sediments are enriched by them in comparison with coarse-grained ones. Different sediment quality criteria complicate the pollution assessment in the bay. Heavy metal concentrations generally fall into allowed depositional values for marine environments; only area in front of the coke plant and the City of Bakar harbor is heavily polluted. Stress-tolerant foraminiferal species dominate at stations with higher concentrations of heavy metals and coarse-grained sediments consist of larger number of epifaunal taxa.","Major,Pollution,Adriatic Sea,Sediment,Foraminifera,minor and trace elements,"
"bi-objective optimal planning for emergency resource allocation in the maritime oil spill accident response phase under uncertainty","2019","Emergency resource allocation is an important issue in emergency response to marine oil spill accident. This paper addresses an emergency resource allocation problem which involves multiple relief resource center and one accident point. To solve this problem, a bi-objective model is constructed to minimize the disposal time and the disposal costs. Due to the existence of uncertainty in different aspects involved in the emergency response to the marine oil spill, we also incorporated into the model some fuzzy parameters. An algorithm based on the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II and the differential evolution algorithm, was presented to obtain the Pareto set.

"joint design of channel estimation and flocking control for multi-auv-based maritime transportation systems","2023","Communication efficiency and flocking stability are two basic requirements for the application of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) in maritime transportation systems. Although they are closely related, most existing flocking approaches focus on the control techniques and ignore the influence of communication efficiency. This paper presents a joint design solution to the channel estimation and flocking control for multi-AUV-based maritime transportation systems, with the consideration of path loss, shadow and multipath fading channels. A value iteration-based reinforcement learning (RL) estimator is first designed to predict the channel quality of AUVs in positions that have not yet visited. With the predicted channel quality, we construct an integrated optimization problem for the co-design of communication and flocking strategies. Along with this, a value iteration-based RL flocking controller is developed to achieve the co-design of channel estimation and flocking control for AUVs. It is worth mentioning that, the value iteration-based RL estimator in this paper can avoid local optimal in traditional least-squares methods, and meanwhile the flocking controller in this paper can make a balance between flocking stability and communication efficiency for AUVs. Finally, simulation and experimental results reveal that the proposed approach in this paper has superior performances by comparing with the other works. As such, our approach is more useful for marine engineer to understand and explore the maritime transportation system from the communication and control view points.","Underwater acoustics,Vehicle dynamics,Transportation,reinforcement learning,Communication-aware,Fading channels,Mathematical models,flocking,Channel estimation,autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs),Force,"

"a time domain-based iterative method for helicopter maritime search area planning and construction of the simulation environment","2020","Helicopters are widely used in maritime search and rescue (SAR) missions. To improve the probability of success (POS) of SAR missions, search areas should be carefully planned. However, the search area is usually determined based on the survivors' probable locations at a given moment by existing planning methods, while the effects of the relative motion between the helicopter and the search objects are ignored, possibly leading to a significant decrease in the POS. To minimize the impact of search object motion, a time domain-based iterative planning (TIP) method is proposed in this article to obtain the optimal search areas. The survivors' probable locations and mean drift direction are updated iteratively, while the probability map is developed by taking survivors' mean drift direction as a reference. Then, the optimal search area is determined by an iterative search method starting from the cell with the highest probability of containment. To evaluate the effectiveness of a search plan, an agent-based simulation environment of a maritime search mission is constructed based on the AnyLogic simulation platform.

"spatial assessment and source identification of heavy metals pollution in surface water using several chemometric techniques","2016","This study presents the determination of the spatial variation and source identification of heavy metal pollution in surface water along the Straits of Malacca using several chemometric techniques. Clustering and discrimination of heavy metal compounds in surface water into two groups (northern and southern regions) are observed according to level of concentrations via the application of chemometric techniques. Principal component analysis (PCA) demonstrates that Cu and Cr dominate the source apportionment in northern region with a total variance of 57.62% and is identified with mining and shipping activities. These are the major contamination contributors in the Straits. Land-based pollution originating from vehicular emission with a total variance of 59.43% is attributed to the high level of Pb concentration in the southern region. The results revealed that one state representing each cluster (northern and southern regions) is significant as the main location for investigating heavy metal concentration in the Straits of Malacca which would save monitoring cost and time.

"interval prediction of vessel trajectory based on lower and upper bound estimation and attention-modified lstm with bayesian optimization","2023","Uncertainty prediction of vessel trajectory is essential to enhance maritime situational awareness and traffic safety. Traditional approaches for trajectory prediction face challenges in accurately quantifying uncertainties, thereby limiting effectiveness in decision-making. To address this challenge, we propose a hybrid interval prediction frame of vessel trajectory using the lower and upper bound estimation (LUBE) and attention-modified long short-term memory (LSTM) network with bayesian optimization (BO). Firstly, trajectory data is preprocessed to solve the scale irregularity. Then, a novel trajectory interval prediction model for perceiving the prediction uncertainties is designed based on an advanced attention-modified LSTM with interval prediction capability. Meanwhile, a supervised training strategy with differentiating the interval widths of latitude and longitude is put forward to devise sample labels for training the model. Additionally, a new prediction interval-based objective function is proposed considering the target of maximizing coverage and minimizing width of trajectory interval. The BO algorithm optimizes the weighted parameters in the LSTM network by minimizing the objective function value. Finally, cases from two water areas are implemented to test and verify the proposed method. The results illustrate the superiority of the proposed approach in (1) outperforming other methods used for comparison in both coverage probability and width criteria of prediction interval. (2) quantifying the prediction uncertainty and improving the reliability of trajectory predictor. (3) performing anomaly detection tasks using visualized trajectory prediction intervals. The research can help maritime traffic participants obtain more reliable trajectory data, which supports making more reasonable traffic supervision decisions.","Long short-term memory,Attention mechanism,Vessel trajectory,Lower and upper bound estimation (LUBE),Interval prediction,"
"maritime small target detection based on appearance stability and depth-normalized motion saliency in infrared video with dense sunglints","2023","Maritime infrared (IR) small target detection in dense sunglint environments has always been challenging. It is difficult for existing methods to distinguish the small target from dense and strong sea clutter because the sea clutter caused by the sunglints has similar spatialâ€“temporal characteristics to small targets. This article proposes a method based on appearance stability and depth-normalized motion saliency (AS-DNMS) for small target detection in IR videos or sequences. First, on each frame of the IR video, the isotropic salience measure (ISM) based on principal curvature filtering is proposed for target enhancement, and an adaptive threshold is used to extract a stable number of candidate targets. Then, we use improved pipeline filtering to form trajectory chains of the candidate targets extracted from the consecutive frames. To improve the matching accuracy of pipeline filtering, we propose an inverse optical flow method to predict the local images of the candidate targets. Third, the motion vectors of the candidate targets are extracted and depth-normalized. According to the principle of projection perspective, a depth normalization model based on the position of the sea-sky line is established, providing a simple and low-cost solution for acquiring depth information of maritime targets under sea-sky backgrounds. Finally, the appearance stability measure (ASM) and the depth-normalized motion saliency measure (DNMSM) are calculated to construct the AS-DNMS joint feature. A double asymptote decision function is employed to determine the real target.

"sa-hpmht for maritime dim targets tracking with sensor location uncertainty","2023","To address the problem of tracking low signal-to-clutter ratio (SCR) maritime targets with sensor location uncertainty, an effective track-before-detect (TBD) method, called the state augmentation histogram probabilistic multihypothesis tracking (SA-HPMHT) algorithm, is proposed in this article.

"physical-biological drivers modulating phytoplankton seasonal succession along the northern antarctic peninsula","2023","The Northern Antarctic Peninsula (NAP) shows shifts in phytoplankton distribution and composition along its warming marine ecosystems. However, despite recent efforts to mechanistically understand these changes, little focus has been given to the phytoplankton seasonal succession, remaining uncertainties regarding to distribution patterns of emerging taxa along the NAP. To fill this gap, we collected phytoplankton (pigment and microscopy analysis) and physico-chemical datasets during spring and summer (November, February and March) of 2013/2014 and 2014/2015 off the NAP. Satellite measurements (sea surface temperature, sea ice concentration and chlorophyll-a) were used to extend the temporal coverage of analysis associated with the in situ sampling. We improved the quantification and distribution pattern of emerging taxa, such as dinoflagellates and cryptophytes, and described a contrasting seasonal behavior and distinct fundamental niche between centric and pennate diatoms. Cryptophytes and pennate diatoms preferentially occupied relatively shallower mixing layers compared with centric diatoms and dinoflagellates, suggesting differences between these groups in distribution and environment occupation over the phytoplankton seasonal succession. Under colder conditions, negative sea surface temperature anomalies were associated with positive anomalies of sea ice concentration and duration. Therefore, based on sea ice–phytoplankton growth relationship, large phytoplankton biomass accumulation was expected during the spring/summer of 2013/2014 and 2014/2015 along the NAP. However, there was a decoupling between sea ice concentration/duration and phytoplankton biomass, characterizing two seasonal periods of low biomass accumulation (negative chlorophyll-a anomalies), associated with the top-down control in the region. These results provide an improved mechanistic understanding on physical-biological drivers modulating phytoplankton seasonal succession along the Antarctic coastal waters.","Shifts,Top-down control,Upper ocean physical structures,Southern ocean,Phytoplankton taxa,Climate change,"
"seamless and energy-efficient maritime coverage in coordinated 6g spaceâ€“airâ€“sea non-terrestrial networks","2023","Non-terrestrial networks (NTNs), which integrate space and aerial networks with terrestrial systems, are a key area in the emerging sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks. As part of 6G, NTNs must provide pervasive connectivity to a wide range of devices, including smartphones, vehicles, sensors, robots, and maritime users. However, due to the high mobility and deployment of NTNs, managing the space-airâ€“sea (SAS) NTN resources, i.e., energy, power, and channel allocation, is a major challenge. The design of an SAS-NTN for energy-efficient resource allocation is investigated in this study. The goal is to maximize system energy efficiency (EE) by collaboratively optimizing user equipment (UE) association, power control, and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) deployment. Given the limited payloads of UAVs, this work focuses on minimizing the total energy cost of UAVs (trajectory and transmission) while meeting EE requirements. A mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem is proposed, followed by the development of an algorithm to decompose, and solve each problem distributedly. The binary (UE association) and continuous (power, deployment) variables are separated using the Bender decomposition (BD), and then the Dinkelbach algorithm (DA) is used to convert fractional programming into an equivalent solvable form in the subproblem. A standard optimization solver is utilized to deal with the complexity of the master problem for binary variables.

"grid size optimization for potential field based maritime anomaly detection","2014","This study focuses on improving the potential field based maritime data modeling method, developed to extract traffic patterns and detect anomalies, in a clear, understandable and informative way. The method's novelty lies in employing the concept of a potential field for AIS vessel tracking data abstraction and maritime traffic representation. Unlike the traditional maritime surveillance equipment, such as radar or GPS, the AIS system comprehensively represents the identity and properties of a vessel, as well as its behavior, thus preserving the effects of navigational decisions, based on the skills of experienced seamen. In the developed data modeling process, every vessel generates potential charges, which value represent the vessel's behavior, and drops the charges at locations it passes. Each AIS report is used to assign a potential charge at the reported vessel positions. The method derives three construction elements, which define, firstly, how charges are accumulated, secondly, how a charge decays over time, and thirdly, in what way the potential is distributed around the source charge. The collection of potential fields represents a model of normal behavior, and vessels not conforming to it are marked as anomalous. In the anomaly detection prototype system STRAND, the sensitivity of anomaly detection can be modified by setting a geographical coordinate grid precision to more dense or coarse. The objective of this study is to identify the optimal grid size for two different conditions – an open sea and a port area case. A noticeable shift can be observed between the results for the open sea and the port area. The plotted detection rates converge towards an optimal ratio for smaller grid sizes in the port area (60-200 meters), than in the open sea case (300-1000 meters). The effective outcome of the potential filed based anomaly detection is filtering out all vessels behaving normally and presenting a set of anomalies, for a subsequent incident analysis using STRAND as an information visualization tool.","maritime traffic,potential field,anomaly detection,AIS,"

Based on the AIS trajectory data of 2014, this paper constructs the oil transportation network of the MSR and analyzes the topological structure and spatial pattern of the oil transportation network of the MSR by applying the complex network theory. The study finds: The oil transportation network of the MSR exhibits the characteristics of the small-world and scale-free as a whole; The space difference of degree and degree distribution is large, and the network centrality shows a trend of decreasing scale and stratification; In the oil transport network, the ports who have the three largest centralities are all the Jurong Port, which has the highest overall centrality and is in the absolute core position; The top 10 ports of the three centralities are basically similar, with only a slight difference in the position order.

"environmental controls on the 2h/1h values of terrestrial leaf waxes in the eastern canadian arctic","2013","The hydrogen isotope composition of plant waxes preserved in lacustrine sediments is a potentially valuable tool for reconstructing paleoenvironmental changes in the Arctic. However, in contrast to the mid- and low-latitudes, significantly less effort has been directed towards understanding the factors controlling D/H fractionation in high latitude plant waxes and the impact of these processes on the interpretation of sedimentary leaf wax δD records. To better understand these processes, we examined the D/H ratios of long chain fatty acids in lake surface sediments spanning a temperature and precipitation gradient on Baffin Island in the eastern Canadian Arctic. D/H ratios of plant waxes increase with increasing temperature and aridity, with values ranging from −240‰ to −160‰ over the study area. Apparent fractionation factors between n-alkanoic acids in Arctic lake sediments and precipitation(εFA-ppt) are less negative than those of mid-latitude lakes and modern plants by 25‰ to 65‰, consistent with n-alkane data from modern Arctic plants (Yang et al., 2011). Furthermore, εFA-ppt values from Arctic lakes become systematically more positive with increasing evaporation, in contrast to mid-latitude sites, which show little to no change in fractionation with aridity. These data are consistent with enhanced water loss and isotope fractionation at higher latitude in the Arctic summer, when continuous sunlight supports increased daily photosynthesis. The dominant control on δDFA variations on Baffin Island is temperature. However, changing εFA-ppt result in steeper δDFA–temperature relationships than observed for modern precipitation. The application of this δDFA-based paleotemperature calibration to existing δDFA records from Baffin Island produces much more realistic changes in late Holocene temperature and highlights the importance of these effects in influencing the interpretation of Arctic δDFA records. A better understanding of the controls on hydrogen isotope fractionation in high latitude leaf waxes will be essential to the proper interpretation of isotope records from sedimentary plant waxes in the Arctic.",""

"deeptracks: geopositioning maritime vehicles in video acquired from a moving platform","2021","Geopositioning and tracking a moving boat at sea is a very challenging problem, requiring boat detection, matching and estimating its GPS location from imagery with no common features. The problem can be stated as follows: given imagery from a camera mounted on a moving platform with known GPS location as the only valid sensor, we predict the geoposition of a target boat visible in images. Our solution uses recent ML algorithms, the camera-scene geometry and Bayesian filtering. The proposed pipeline first detects and tracks the target boatâ€™s location in the image with the strategy of tracking by detection. This image location is then converted to geoposition to the local sea coordinates referenced to the camera GPS location using plane projective geometry. Finally, target boat local coordinates are transformed to global GPS coordinates to estimate the geoposition. To achieve a smooth geotrajectory, we apply unscented Kalman filter (UKF) which implicitly overcomes small detection errors in the early stages of the pipeline. We tested the performance of our approach using GPS ground truth and show the accuracy and speed of the estimated geopositions. The source code will be made public once the paper is accepted.","Pipelines,DeepTracks,Kalman filters,Object Tracking by Detection,geoposition,Prediction algorithms,global GPS,Bayes methods,Cameras,Bayesian filtering,camera GPS location,pipeline,maritime vehicle geopositioning,Global Positioning System,image location,Unscented Kalman Filter,UKF,Filtering,camera-scene geometry,boats,unscented Kalman filter,Target tracking,cameras,object detection,video signal processing,moving platform,boat detection,marine engineering computing,GPS ground truth,plane projective geometry,local sea coordinates,Plane Projective Geometry,Boats,Geopositioning,GPS location,moving boat,ML algorithms,Deep Learning,target boat local coordinates,"
"detecting anomalous deviations from standard maritime routes using the ornsteinâ€“uhlenbeck process","2018","A novel anomaly detection procedure based on the Ornsteinâ€“Uhlenbeck (OU) mean-reverting stochastic process is presented. The considered anomaly is a vessel that deviates from a planned route, changing its nominal velocity $\boldsymbol{v}_0$. In order to hide this behavior, the vessel switches off its automatic identification system (AIS) device for a time  $T$ and then tries to revert to the previous nominal velocity $\boldsymbol{v}_0$. The decision that has to be made is declaring that a deviation either happened or not, relying only upon two consecutive AIS contacts. Furthermore, the extension to the scenario in which multiple contacts (e.g., radar) are available during the time period $T$ is also considered. A proper statistical hypothesis testing procedure that builds on the changes in the OU process long-term velocity parameter $\boldsymbol{v}_0$ of the vessel is the core of the proposed approach and enables the solution of the anomaly detection problem.

"using artificial neural network model for berth congestion risk prediction","2022","The seaport plays a critical role in the global supply chain management. Today, with the increasing growth of the global containerized trade, many challenges appears for the seaport, one of the most significant challenges is the berth allocation problem BAP, this fact impact all the seaport operations and benefits. The aim of this paper is to treat one the lead causes of BAP which is the berth congestion risk. Based on an ANN algorithm we tried to predict the congestion risk which is related directly with of the delay of vessels in the berth of the seaport. In this sense, we used a real combined dataset containing many features and we treat the correlation of each feature with the dependent variable, before applying six known models in order to compare the performance of the proposed ANN model. The result ensures that the proposed model surpasses the six traditional model on the tree chosen metrics of evaluation, F1 Score F1S = 86%, Recall RS = 88% and Accuracy = 96.5% which allow us to adopt this model for our case.

"fault analysis for protection purposes in maritime applications","2016","The method of symmetrical components simplifies analysis of a three-phase network and provides information regarding the existance of a fault in the system. This concept is applied to a radial power system in the maritime sector. A fault analysis is performed for the main types of faults, applied in different locations of the network. The fault current is measured using the current transformers that are already present in the system as part of a time-inverse overcurrent protection. Simulation results show that the symmetrical components of the currents seen by these current transformers can be used to detect the electric fault. The method also provides an improved fault detection over the conventional overcurrent relays in some situations.

"fusion of camera-based vessel detection and ais for maritime surveillance","2021","Camera-based vessel identification is one of the essential maritime surveillance measures. The existing deep learning (DL)-based vessel classification methods have challenges in achieving the detailed vessel information (e.g., vessel identity) under poor visual conditions. In some applications, they cannot meet the safe scheduling and abnormal activity identification purposes in the camera surveillance system. This paper proposed a fusion framework, which takes the visual detection and the automatic identification system (AIS) as inputs to obtain accurate and robust vessel identification to address these challenges. Visual detection uses an innovative method to estimate the distance of the identified vessel target from the camera and the azimuth angle relative to the camera based on the images from the monocular camera. The distance and azimuth angle were further fused with AIS data to obtain the fused output. The test results based on 3976 images show that the mean absolute error of the visual-based distance estimation method is 0.72km.

"trajectory design for uav-enabled maritime secure communications: a reinforcement learning approach","2022","This paper investigates an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled maritime secure communication network, where the UAV aims to provide the communication service to a legitimate mobile vessel in the presence of multiple eavesdroppers. In this maritime communication networks (MCNs), it is challenging for the UAV to determine its trajectory on the ocean, since it cannot land or replenish energy on the sea surface, the trajectory should be pre-designed before the UAV takes off. Furthermore, the take-off location of the UAV and the sea lane of the vessel may be random, which leads to a highly dynamic environment. To address these issues, we propose two reinforcement learning schemes, Q-learning and deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithms, to solve the discrete and continuous UAV trajectory design problem, respectively. Simulation results are provided to validate the effectiveness and superior performance of the proposed reinforcement learning schemes versus the existing schemes in the literature. Additionally, the proposed DDPG algorithm converges faster and achieves higher utilities for the UAV, compared to the Q-learning algorithm.","Satellites,telecommunication security,physical layer security,remotely operated vehicles,Marine vehicles,control engineering computing,reinforcement learning schemes,unmanned aerial vehicle-enabled maritime secure communication network,MCN,UAV-enabled maritime secure communications,trajectory design,reinforcement learning,communication service,Autonomous aerial vehicles,continuous UAV trajectory design problem,autonomous aerial vehicles,Optimization,maritime communication networks (MCNs),Trajectory,marine communication,Signal to noise ratio,maritime communication networks,Q-learning,unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV),telecommunication control,discrete UAV trajectory design problem,"

"safeway: improving the safety of autonomous waypoint detection in maritime using transformer and interpolation","2023","Detecting waypoints where vessels change their behavior (i.e., maneuvers, speed changes, etc.) is essential for optimizing vessel trajectories to increase the efficiency and safety of sailing. However, accurately detecting waypoints is challenging due to potential AIS data quality issues (i.e., missing or inaccurate messages). In this paper, we propose a five-step learning approach (SafeWay) to estimate waypoints on a given AIS trajectory. First, we interpolate trajectories to tackle AIS data quality issues. Then, we annotate historical trajectories by using an existing waypoint library that contains historical waypoints. As the historical waypoints are passage plans manually created by port operators considering sailing conditions at that time, they are not specific to other historical trajectories between the same ports. We, therefore, use a similarity metric to determine overlapping segments of historical trajectories with the historical waypoints from the waypoint library. Then, we build a transformer model to capture vessel movement patterns based on speed- and location-related features. We do not process location features directly to avoid learning location-specific context, but take into account tailored delta features. We test our approach on a real-world AIS dataset collected from the Norwegian Sea between Å lesund and Måløy and show its effectiveness in terms of a harmonic mean of purity and coverage, mean absolute error and detection rate on the task of detecting trajectory waypoints compared to a state-of-the-art approach. We also show the effectiveness of the trained model on the trajectories obtained from two other regions, the North Sea (London and Rotterdam) and the North Atlantic Ocean (Setubal and Gibraltar), on which the model has not been trained. The experiments indicate that our interpolation-enabled transformer design provides improvements in the safety of the estimated waypoints.","Transformers,Maritime,Interpolation,Safety,Trajectory prediction,Vessel,Maneuver,Waypoint detection,Automatic identification system,AIS,"

"multi-label classification for ais data anomaly detection using wavelet transform","2022","Thanks to the Automatic Identification System (AIS), ships and other maritime equipment are able to communicate with each other, for example, by sending information about their position. This solution allows for early collision detection when two or more ships are on a collision course. In the newer version of AIS, a satellite infrastructure is used to extend the communication range. Unfortunately, satellite AIS deals with so-called packet collision effect: since there is a problem with synchronizing AIS data coming from multiple terrestrial areas, a single satellite may receive several AIS messages at the same time and be unable to correctly process them, causing the data to get lost or garbled. In this article, a machine learning based framework for detecting the incorrect AIS data is presented. In this approach, after the first stage (clustering), a dedicated anomaly detection algorithm searches for damaged AIS messages and conducts multi-label classification (with Random Forest and wavelet transform) to decide which fields of such message requires further correction.

"an enhanced dv-hop positioning scheme based on spring model and reliable beacon node set","2022","How to get the node position, as a hotter topic in the field of wireless communication, is the primary problem to be solved in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). The DV-Hop positioning scheme is a kind of range-free positioning scheme, which has been favored by researchers in recent years. However, the original DV-Hop scheme faces the shortcoming of low positioning precision and stability. To ameliorate the positioning capability of the DV-Hop, an enhanced DV-Hop scheme based on the spring model and reliable beacon node set has been presented in this paper. Firstly, the relationship between nodes in the network is abstracted as a spring model, and the distance between unknown nodes and beacon nodes is corrected by comprehensively considering the influence of each beacon node from the physical phenomenon of force vector decomposition. After that, based on the random sample consensus (RANSAC) algorithm, the reliable beacon nodes with smaller distance deviation to the unknown node are picked out to compute the unknown node coordinates, rather than all beacon nodes participating in the calculation. Finally, extensive experiments have been conducted on distance accuracy and positioning performance. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed positioning scheme outperforms better than original DV-Hop and other existing improved schemes under different scenarios.","Positioning accuracy,RANSAC algorithm,Distance precision,DV-Hop scheme,WSN,"
"distributed adaptive time slot allocation for wimax based maritime wireless mesh networks","2009","We envisage extending radio coverage of the existing terrestrial wireless broadband networks to the sea to provide ships with cost-efficient high-speed connection to the Internet.

This papers proposes a distributed adaptive time slot allocation (DATSA) scheme for WiMAX mesh MAC protocol. DATSA is a distributed scheme that allocates time slots robustly by taking into consideration difference between radio reception range and interference range, and latency in scheduling control messages. DATSA has a method to monitor reception quality of an allocated time slot, in order to detect the effect of topology changes due to ship mobility, etc. Based on the monitoring outcome, the method adaptively changes the time slot allocation if necessary.
