"a novel semi-supervised learning approach for state of health monitoring of maritime lithium-ion batteries","2023","Lithium-ion batteries are a prominent technology for the electrification of the transport sector, which itself is a key measure towards the departure from fossil fuels. The “green shift” is taking place in the marine industry too, where the number of battery-powered vessels is fastly growing. In this case, monitoring the battery State of Health is essential more than ever to optimise battery use, promote safety, and ensure the coverage of ship power and energy demands. Classification societies typically require annual capacity tests for this purpose; however, the tests are disruptive, costly and time-consuming. As a consequence they are seldom, in addition to not being always fully reliable. We propose a novel alternative semi-supervised learning approach to estimate the State of Health of a lithium-ion battery system with no labelled data, starting from a minimal set of weakly labelled data from another similar system. The method is based on operational sensor data gathered from the battery, together with the battery State of Charge. Our results show that the procedure is valid, and the obtained estimates can be used to significantly progress in failure prevention, operational optimisation, and for planning batteries at the design stage.","State of Health monitoring,Data-driven modelling,Multivariable Fractional Polynomial regression,Maritime battery systems,Semi-supervised learning,"
"contaminants in two west greenland caribou populations","2016","Two caribou populations in West Greenland were sampled and the kidneys, liver and muscle analyzed for contaminants, including aluminum, arsenic, cadmium, copper, lead, mercury, selenium and zinc. Although close in proximity, the two populations are topographically separated by an ice cap, which creates different climates and vegetation types in each region. Contaminant levels reflected the differing diets of the two caribou populations. To the south in the wetter lichen-rich region, caribou had significantly more aluminum, arsenic, cadmium, lead, mercury, selenium and zinc, likely due to atmospheric deposition on lichens. To the north in the dry desert steppe where grasses predominate, caribou had higher levels of copper. Cows collected in late winter had significantly less hepatic copper, lead and mercury if pregnant, indicating placental transfer of these elements. Our results suggest that hepatic copper levels <200μgg−1 dry weight may result in copper depletion in pregnant cows and hepatic mercury concentrations above 0.5μgg−1 dry weight may negatively affect fertility in caribou cows. Hepatic mercury levels were negatively correlated with cow body weight, suggesting an adverse effect on body condition. Element concentrations found in tissues from these caribou are not considered to be of a health concern for those consuming this traditional food.","Copper,Lead,Selenium,Mercury,Cadmium,Caribou,"
"a novel quality control method of time-series ocean wave observation data combining deep-learning prediction and statistical analysis","2023","Quality control (QC) of marine data is a critical aspect in ensuring the usability of oceanic data. In this paper, we propose a novel QC method for time-series ocean wave data, which combines deep learning prediction and statistical analysis. Our method first realizes multi-element LSTM prediction of the time-series ocean wave observation data, capturing both temporal consistency and physical relationships between the multi-element inputs. Then, it applies peak detection on the regional mean difference ratio derived from the predicted and true values of the ocean wave data, and finally labels the anomalous data points based on peak detection results. We conducted experiments on the time-series wave data of four sites from the National Marine Science Center, China, and compared our proposed method with traditional QC method that is currently used for operational marine data quality control, as well as classic anomaly detection models including Isolation Forest and VAE-LSTM. The results show a significant improvement in the Precision, Recall, and F1 Score for erroneous samples using our proposed method. Our proposed method takes advantages of both deep learning and statistical analysis and considers physical correlation of multiple elements of marine data, effectively addressing the problem of erroneous discrimination of abnormal sea conditions in the traditional method, and providing valuable insights for the study of marine time-series observational data.","Deep-learning prediction,Time-series data,Statistical analysis,Quality control,"
"maritime anomaly detection in a real-world scenario: ever given grounding in the suez canal","2022","In this paper we present how automatic maritime anomaly detection tools can be successfully applied in real-world situations such as the major event of the container vessel Ever Given, which grounded in the Suez Canal on March 23rd 2021. The anomaly detector is designed to process the available sequence of Automatic Identification System (AIS) reports, information from ground-based or satellite radar systems if available, and contextual information defining the expected nominal behavior of navigation. A statistical hypothesis testing procedure is sequentially run to decide whether or not a deviation from the nominal behavior happened within a specific time period, for instance two consecutive data points. We show, based on the recorded AIS data from the Ever Given, that the proposed detector could have been triggered and alerted to anomalous behavior fully 19 minutes before the grounding.","anomaly detector,Anomaly detection,Marine vehicles,Grounding,statistical hypothesis testing,Ever Given grounding,automatic maritime anomaly detection tools,statistical analysis,Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process,Testing,ships,Containers,automatic identification system,radar,maritime surveillance,satellite radar systems,contextual information,container vessel,Suez Canal,Artificial intelligence,ground-based system,marine engineering computing,Maritime anomaly detection,Irrigation,statistical hypothesis testing procedure,expected nominal behavior,AIS data,"
"detecting outlier pairs in complex network based on link structure and semantic relationship","2017","In this paper, we propose an outlier pair detection method, called LSOutPair, which discovers the vast differences between link structure and semantic relationship. LSOutPair addresses three important challenges: (1) how can we measure the target object's link similarity among multi-typed objects and multi-typed relations? (2) how can we measure the semantic similarity using the short texts? (3) how can we find the objects’ maximum differences between link structure and semantic relationship? To tackle these challenges, LSOutPair applies three main techniques: (1) two matrices are used to store link similarity and semantic similarity, (2) a k-step index algorithm, which calculates the term weighting for each object, (3) applying the linear transformation of Frobenius norm to matrices can obtain the top-K outlier pairs. LSOutPair considers link and semantics in complex network simultaneously, which is a new attempt in data mining. Substantial experiments show that LSOutPair is very effective for outlier pair detection.","Complex network,Semantic relationship,Outlier pair detection,-step index,Link structure,"
"intensified aridity over the indo-pacific warm pool controlled by ice-sheet expansion during the last glacial maximum","2022","The magnitude, direction and cause of precipitation changes across the Indo-Pacific Warm Pool (IPWP) during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) remain elusive. In particular, it is still inconclusive whether tropical or extra-tropical factors controlled such precipitation changes. Determining the spatio-temporal distribution of precipitation in the IPWP during the LGM is a valid strategy to address this issue, but the existing precipitation records are dominantly from maritime continents and marginal seas, with few data from pelagic oceans. In order to fill this gap, we analyzed the oxygen isotopic compositions of single Ethmodiscus rex diatom frustules (δ18OE. rex) from a sediment core (WPD-03) consisting of laminated diatom mats (LDMs) in the eastern Philippine Sea (EPS). δ18OE. rex was controlled mainly by sea-surface salinity variation and, thus, can reflect open-ocean precipitation changes across the IPWP. Our precipitation proxy records, in combination with existing published data, reveal spatial patterns of precipitation change that indicate overall drying across the IPWP during the LGM. Based on a comparison of paleoclimatic records with modeling results, we propose that extra-tropical factors (ice-sheet size) controlled precipitation variability in the IPWP during the LGM through a combination of zonal shifts of ENSO and meridional migration of the ITCZ. Strong aridity during the LGM prevented formation of a subsurface barrier layer and, hence, allowed accessing of sufficient nutrients to surface waters, stimulating blooms of E. rex and subsequent formation of LDMs in the IPWP. These findings suggest an important role for high-latitude climate in the tropical hydrological cycle during the LGM.","Tropical West Pacific,Diatom blooms,Sea-surface salinity,Model simulation,Tropical hydroclimate,High-latitude forcing,"
"volcanic and tectonic features of shirahama bank in the northern ryukyu arc: implications for cross-arc volcanism controlled by arc-parallel extension","2021","This paper presents volcanic and tectonic features of Shirahama Bank, an unexplored shallow submarine edifice in the northern Ryukyu Arc which was previously poorly mapped, and consequently the nature of its volcanism and tectonism have been poorly understood. New high-resolution (5 m) bathymetry revealed that Shirahama Bank has small volcanic edifices and depressions on its flat top with water depths of 60–150 m. The edifices have pointy summits with steep slopes greater than 30°. Within the depressions, a total of 59 acoustic bubble plumes were detected by shipboard multibeam sonar, suggesting that active volcanic degassing occurs in this region. The bank is dissected entirely by NW–SE to WNW–ESE trending lineaments while the volcanic edifices and depressions on the flat top are undissected. Shirahama Bank was formed by multiple-stages of volcanism. The youngest volcanic stage probably occurred after surface erosion by sea-level low-stand during the late Pleistocene and after tectonic deformation, providing a constraint on the timing of Quaternary volcanism in the northern Ryukyu Arc. Structural control of arc volcanism in the area is observed. The NW–SE to WNW–ESE lineaments identified on and around Shirahama Bank are interpreted as normal faults and form cross-arc graben structures. The young volcanic structures and active bubble plumes at Shirahama Bank and surrounding areas are concentrated within these cross-arc grabens, suggesting that the most recent volcanism is controlled by ~NE–SW extension (arc-parallel or along-arc extension) in the northern Ryukyu Arc. Our results, combined with previous studies, suggest that arc-parallel extension, which differs from the previously known back-arc extension in the Okinawa Trough, plays an important role in arc volcanism during its initial stages.","Ryukyu Arc,Bubble plume,Arc-parallel extension,Cross-arc volcanism,"
"ship anti-grounding with a maritime autonomous surface ship and digital twin of port of hamburg","2023","We present the virtual demonstration of a novel ship Anti-Grounding Service in a digital twinned use case scenario in the Port of Hamburg. The scenario is generated from real bathymetry survey data collected in the Port. The virtual model of a Maritime Autonomous Surface Ship travels the route ahead of merchant ships on approach to the Port and is integrated with a real-time high-resolution Multibeam SONAR Simulator that synthesizes underkeel survey data. The automated data processing workflow detects potential grounding hazards in the synthetic survey data and provides a real-time update of the Port nautical chart, which is presented in the Electronic Chart Display and Information System of a Ship Handling Simulator. Our method is the first to consider Multibeam SONAR equipped Maritime Autonomous Surface Ship platforms for provision of ship Anti-Grounding Services. The results validate the full-scale simulation and automated hazard detection workflow and incorporate tests conducted with certified mariners (N=10) to address human factors of introducing new technologies into safety critical situations. The key contributions of this work are summarized as: 1) Validation of Maritime Autonomous Surface Ships as an Anti-Grounding Service delivery platform; 2) Demonstration of a Digital Twin for hydrography survey and bottom hazard detection; and 3) Experimental validation with certified mariners of the anti-grounding service Human-Computer Interface on the ship bridge.","digital twinned use case scenario,automated data processing workflow,ship antigrounding service,underkeel survey data,electronic chart display,Bridges,human factors,bathymetry survey data,safety,grounding hazards,antigrounding service delivery platform,hydrography,Surveys,digital twins,ships,marine safety,maritime autonomous surface ship platforms,autonomous,port nautical chart,synthetic survey data,Seaports,object detection,automated hazard detection workflow,simulation,digital twin,ship handling simulator,sonar,unmanned vehicle,Autonomous aerial vehicles,bathymetry,Real-time systems,antigrounding service human-computer interface,real-time high-resolution multibeam SONAR simulator,merchant ship,Hazards,hazards,Hamburg port,SONAR,ports,navigation,Digital twins,merchant ships,oceanographic techniques,ship bridge,"
"trade-off between latency and energy for offloading tasks in maritime internet of things","2022","With the advancement of maritime activities, the number of Maritime Internet-of-Things (M-IoT) devices is growing exponentially. However, due to the limited computational capacity of the M-IoT devices and the complex maritime network environment, the edge and central cloud computing scenarios can be adopted. Existing works have neither considered interference between the communication of ships nor the trade-off scenario between latency and energy consumption. In this paper, we have provided an optimization framework, namely VESBELT, which enable a trade-off between the minimization of service latency and energy consumption for offloading tasks on the edge or central cloud servers. Our experimental results depict that the developed system VESBELT is superior to contemporary works in terms of service latency and energy usage.","Mobile Edge Computing (MEC),computer network security,contemporary works,offloading tasks,Internet of Things,Energy consumption,Maritime Internet-of-Things,trade-off scenario,optimization framework,complex maritime network environment,Energy Consumption,ships,Servers,computational capacity,cloud computing,Task Offloading,Service Latency,central cloud computing scenarios,energy consumption,Minimization,Cloud computing,Interference,Internet,energy usage,maritime activities,NP-hard problem,M-IoT devices,"
"synoptic weather conditions and changing fire regimes in a mediterranean environment","2018","Analysis of global change effects on fire regimes requires evaluations of key processes explaining fire activity at the appropriate spatial and temporal scales. Classifications of the weather conditions prevailing at large continental scales (called “Synoptic Weather Types”, SWT) offer convenient potential proxies for integrating weather-related factors into our understanding of fire regime attributes at regional scales. Here we establish a methodology for identifying the major SWT that lead to wildfires and assessing their influence on fire regime in interaction with other global drivers such as drought events or fire suppression policies. Based on days with fires larger than 50 ha that occurred in Catalonia, a region located in the western Mediterranean Basin, we propose a clustering methodology using data of temperature at 850 hPa, sea level pressure and winds at 925 hPa from the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis dataset covering the whole of western Europe (25–70°N and 20°W–40°E). Our classification method proposes 6 SWT: three that were characterized by synoptic conditions leading to strong winds in the region, two that led to ‘hot and dry’ environments, and one that was not characterized by any strong weather determinants. Fires under ‘hot and dry’ conditions, such as the South intrusion SWT, triggered the bulk of fires and burnt area in the region. Spatial analyses of fire distribution under each SWT revealed markedly different fire-prone locations, opening the possibility for strategic planning of fire management based on local fire regimes. Fires occurring during mild years (wet spring conditions) and under ‘hot-and-dry’ SWTs have been eradicated from the region thanks to enhanced firefighting capability, and fire sizes in dry years have strongly reduced. In contrast, fires occurring under windy situations have not followed the same course of change and have not diminished in incidence over time, and seem to be more difficult to control using current fire suppression strategies. The role of SWT on determining fire regimes and its interaction with fire suppression strategies has a huge potential to help researchers and managers develop better fire analyses based on sound physical grounds and serve to understand and eventually regulate the adverse impacts of fire regime changes in a global change context.","Firefighting,Catalonia,Heat-wave,Drought event,Fire size distribution,Wind-driven fire,Kernel density,"
"understanding global spatio-temporal trends and the relationship between vegetation greenness and climate factors by land cover during 1982–2014","2020","Analysis of the correlation between vegetation greenness and climate variable trends is important in the study of vegetation greenness. Our study used Normalized Difference Vegetation Index-3rd generation data from the Advanced Very High-Resolution Radiometer - Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies (AVHRR-GIMMS NDVI3g), land cover data from the Climate Change Initiative (CCI-LC), and climate data from the Climatic Research Unit global time series (CRU TS) of climate variables (temperature and precipitation, solar radiation) over the past 33 years. First, we estimated the overall trends for vegetation greenness and climate variables over five time periods. Second, we subjected the data to correlation, regression, and residual analyses to detect correlations between vegetation greenness and different climate variables. Third, we extracted trends and correlation results by primary land cover types for each climate zone. Our study was focused at the global scale, and findings indicate that the largest decreasing trend of vegetation greenness and grasslands occurred in the mid-latitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere and in parts of South America, Africa, Saudi Arabia, and south and northeast Asia. In particular, the cold climatic zones of forest (36.6%), cropland (36.6%), and grassland (14.1%) suffered significant decline in vegetation greenness. Anthropogenic activities are mainly responsible for declining vegetation greenness particularly in northern Africa, central and western Asia. However, residual analysis shows an increase in vegetation greenness in some parts of western Europe, southern Australia, and the northern part of South America. The study also identified temperature and precipitation as the main factors responsible for controlling vegetation growth. Hot-spot areas with the largest temperature increases were found in the Amazon, Central America, southern Greenland, east Africa, south-east Asia, and other areas. However, temperatures decreased in the western part of South America, Angola, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Papua New Guinea. Precipitation decreased the most from March to May over most parts of the world with high correlation (r = 0.88) in Russia Canada, northeast Asia, and central Africa. In general, climate factors were the principal drivers of the variation in vegetation greenness globally in recent years.","Vegetation greenness trends,Land cover,Correlation,Precipitation,Global,Temperature,"
"vessel sailing route extraction and analysis from satellite-based ais data using density clustering and probability algorithms","2023","The vessel Automatic Identification System (AIS) data collected by satellites have the features of large coverage area and large data volume, and they are instantaneous discrete data rather than time-continuous data, so the data has large dispersion with many noise points. This poses a challenge for vessel sailing route extraction. This paper proposes a vessel sailing route extraction method which consists of the fast Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm and the Kernel Density Estimation-based Outlier Factor (KDE-based OF) noise reduction algorithm. The method in this paper firstly improves the clustering discrimination method in the DBSCAN algorithm to separate trajectories in different directions. Secondly, this paper extracts a fast clustering algorithm based on the density clustering algorithm to reduce its computing time overhead with satellite big data. Finally, this paper proposes the KDE-based OF processing algorithm, which calculates the outlier probability distribution value of the trajectory points through the algorithm to eliminate the edge trajectory points with low probability distribution. Based on the actual satellite vessel AIS data, this paper conducts multi-method comparisons and performance analysis experiments. Experiments show that the proposed method has the best stability and advancement.","Vessel sailing route extraction,Kernel Density Estimation-based Outlier Factor (KDE-based OF),Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN),Automatic Identification System (AIS),"
"development and deployment of multi-mission intelligent autonomous maritime systems","2020","Cherokee Nation Strategic Programs (CNSP) and Ocean Aero, Inc. have teamed together to demonstrate the multi-mission capabilities of commercial autonomous maritime systems. CNSP has a proven record testing, fielding, and developing Unmanned Systems (UxS) programs across air, ground, and maritime domains. Ocean Aero has developed a portfolio of intelligent autonomous underwater and surface vehicles that are uniquely engineered for a wide range of applications above and below the ocean surface. The focus of our collaboration is the accelerated deployment of autonomous capabilities in operational mission scenarios. Unmanned systems are demonstrating daily value to commercial and civilian users today. Drones are rapidly moving beyond powerful remotely controlled information capture tools into advanced networks of aerial robots providing services and access that was never before considered valuable. Ground robot technologies are maturing just as rapidly and taking on many different forms as purpose-built systems are enabling subterranean exploration, driver safety on interstate highways, and disaster response support. Maritime systems are now fulfilling the same potential with robust, all-weather designs that enable long endurance, rugged missions for marine users. The operational value that these systems provide comes from the advancements in intelligent autonomy. We are currently testing the range of autonomous capabilities of the Ocean Aero Triton Series autonomous underwater and surface vehicle systems at the University of Southern Mississippi Marine Research Center (USM MRC). The Ocean Aero vehicles are designed and built with autonomous, persistent navigation capabilities as a standard feature. Additional customized, mission-centric sensors may be added to the systems to accomplish specific operational tasks and/or increase autonomous performance. The command-and-control (C2) communication architecture provides situational awareness and mission progress monitoring for the onboard vehicle decision-making, as well as the remote operator control station. To successfully achieve the high level of autonomous operations in locations without terrestrial communications (cellular) and beyond visual line of sight, UxS use satellite communications for navigation and mission data transfer. Our testing is evaluating the ability of the autonomous systems to accomplish multiple missions, including perimeter security, tracking of other surface vehicles, environmental monitoring, and marine science missions. These evaluations include the performance of the vehicles, the sensors, and the multi-domain communication systems, while characterizing the operating conditions for each test series. â€œAutonomyâ€ is a capability that means different things to different people. Our testing at the MRC is evaluating the ability of the system to react to new information, whether from external source or self-perceived, to accomplish the intended mission, such as detection of an unknown vehicle in the area. This ability to react includes concepts such as dynamic replanning for navigation, as well as communications with the operations center for mission management awareness. Through these communications and activities, we are measuring the operator workloads in multiple missions to determine if the autonomy in the system is increasing, decreasing, or improving operator performance. Our testing team was assembled specifically to accomplish these objectives. The full technical paper will include sample test cases and data collection examples for evaluating the Ocean Aero autonomous underwater and surface vehicle technologies using the Cherokee Nation Capabilities-Based Assessment process. This is the proven, repeatable process that we have used for evaluating air, ground, and maritime unmanned systems for many customers. We use this process for assessing the operational performance of mature products, not research-only test units. This focus on technologies that are commercially available or at least products from an active production line, allow us to evaluate capabilities as they relate to mission requirements and user objectives. We have the team with the experience, the equipment, the facilities, and the dedication to advance the expectations of what is possible for unmanned maritime systems. This paper covers the process for achieving that advancement, including identifying the challenges such as evaluating autonomous capabilities and operating in live environments.","research-only test units,Ocean Aero vehicles,Vehicle dynamics,operational value,autonomous navigation capabilities,mission progress monitoring,Cherokee Nation capabilities-based assessment process,UxS,remotely controlled information capture tools,Sensor systems,ocean surface,unmanned maritime systems,ground robot technologies,autonomy,terrestrial communications,maritime unmanned systems,onboard vehicle decision-making,command-and-control communication architecture,mission data transfer,satellite communication,multidomain communication systems,Testing,Vehicles,command-and-control,mission requirements,purpose-built systems,BVLOS,autonomous underwater vehicles,rugged missions,Sea surface,telecontrol,multimission intelligent autonomous maritime systems,testing team,data collection examples,CNSP,sensors,decision making,intelligent autonomy,persistent navigation capabilities,situational awareness,surface vehicle technologies,command and control systems,visual line of sight,path planning,mission management awareness,satellite communications,unmanned surface vehicles,mobile robots,sample test cases,test and evaluation,unmanned systems,UXS,Visualization,customized mission-centric sensors,maritime domains,Tools,surface vehicles,operational mission scenarios,surface vehicle systems,remote operator control station,University of Southern Mississippi Marine Research Center,Cherokee Nation Strategic Programs,intelligent autonomous underwater vehicles,"
"cyber insurance in the maritime transportation system","2023","The current cyber insurance model is poorly suited for and does not aid the cyber resilience of the maritime transport system. Traditional maritime insurance increasingly exempts cyber claims from policies making cyber insurance a necessity for protecting against cyber risk.

Our paper attempts to address this disconnect by analyzing the current cyber insurance marketplace in the maritime transportation system and identifying challenges and opportunities that aim to increase resilience.","Insurance,Economics,Transportation,insurance,Limiting,cybersecurity,resilience,Security,Industries,Maritime transportation system,Government,"
"a cloud based architecture capable of perceiving and predicting multiple vessel behaviour","2015","Progressively huge amounts of data, tracking vessels during their voyages across the seas, are becoming available, mostly due to the automatic identification system (AIS) that vessels of specific categories are required to carry. These datasets provide detailed insights into the patterns vessels follow, while safely navigating across the globe, under various conditions. In this paper, we develop an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) capable of predicting a vessels future behaviour (position, speed and course), based on events that occur in a predictable pattern, across large map areas. The main concept of this study is to determine if an ANN is capable of inferring the unique behavioural patterns that each vessel follows and successively use this as a means for predicting multiple vessel behaviour into a future point in time. We design, train and implement a proof of concept ANN, as a cloud based web application, with the ability of overlaying predicted short and long term vessel behaviour on an interactive map. Our proposed approach could potentially assist in busy port scheduling, vessel route planning, anomaly detection and increasing overall Maritime Domain Awareness.","Vessel behaviour prediction,Soft computing applications,Artificial Neural Network,Automated identification system,Maritime Domain Awareness,"
"remote sensing annual dynamics of rapid permafrost thaw disturbances with landtrendr","2022","Permafrost is warming globally which leads to widespread permafrost thaw. Particularly ice-rich permafrost is vulnerable to rapid thaw and erosion, impacting whole landscapes and ecosystems. Retrogressive thaw slumps (RTS) are abrupt permafrost disturbances that expand by several meters each year and lead to an increased soil organic carbon release. Local Remote Sensing studies identified increasing RTS activity in the last two decades by increasing number of RTS or heightened RTS growth rates. However, a large-scale assessment across diverse permafrost regions and at high temporal resolution allowing to further determine RTS thaw dynamics and its main drivers is still lacking. In this study we apply the disturbance detection algorithm LandTrendr for automated large-scale RTS mapping and high temporal thaw dynamic assessment to North Siberia (8.1×106km2). We adapted and parametrised the temporal segmentation algorithm for abrupt disturbance detection to incorporate Landsat+Sentinel-2 mosaics, conducted spectral filtering, spatial masking and filtering, and a binary machine-learning object classification of the disturbance output to separate between RTS and false positives (F1 score: 0.609). Ground truth data for calibration and validation of the workflow was collected from 9 known RTS cluster sites using very high-resolution RapidEye and PlanetScope imagery. Our study presents the first automated detection and assessment of RTS and their temporal dynamics at large-scale for 2001–2019. We identified 50,895 RTS and a steady increase in RTS-affected area from 2001 to 2019 across North Siberia, with a more abrupt increase from 2016 onward. Overall the RTS-affected area increased by 331% compared to 2000 (2000: 20,158ha, 2001–2019: 66,699ha). Contrary to this, 5 focus sites show spatio-temporal variability in their annual RTS dynamics, with alternating periods of increased and decreased RTS development, indicating a close relationship to thaw drivers. The majority of identified RTS was active from 2000 onward and only a small proportion initiated during the assessment period, indicating that the increase in RTS-affected area was mainly caused by enlarging existing RTS and not by new RTS. The detected increase in RTS dynamics suggests advancing permafrost thaw and underlines the importance of assessing abrupt permafrost disturbances with high spatial and temporal resolution at large-scales. Obtaining such consistent disturbance products will help to parametrise regional and global climate change models.","Landsat,Sentinel-2,Time series,Permafrost thaw,Multi-spectral analysis,Thermo-erosion,Retrogressive thaw slumps,"

"mutation in pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase 1 gene in families with cutis laxa type 2","2009","Autosomal-recessive cutis laxa type 2 (ARCL2) is a multisystem disorder characterized by the appearance of premature aging, wrinkled and lax skin, joint laxity, and a general developmental delay. Cutis laxa includes a family of clinically overlapping conditions with confusing nomenclature, generally requiring molecular analyses for definitive diagnosis. Six genes are currently known to mutate to yield one of these related conditions. We ascertained a cohort of typical ARCL2 patients from a subpopulation isolate within eastern Canada. Homozygosity mapping with high-density SNP genotyping excluded all six known genes, and instead identified a single homozygous region near the telomere of chromosome 17, shared identically by state by all genotyped affected individuals from the families. A putative pathogenic variant was identified by direct DNA sequencing of genes within the region. The single nucleotide change leads to a missense mutation adjacent to a splice junction in the gene encoding pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase 1 (PYCR1). Bioinformatic analysis predicted a pathogenic effect of the variant on splice donor site function. Skipping of the associated exon was confirmed in RNA from blood lymphocytes of affected homozygotes and heterozygous mutation carriers. Exon skipping leads to deletion of the reductase functional domain-coding region and an obligatory downstream frameshift. PYCR1 plays a critical role in proline biosynthesis. Pathogenicity of the genetic variant in PYCR1 is likely, given that a similar clinical phenotype has been documented for mutation carriers of another proline biosynthetic enzyme, pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase. Our results support a significant role for proline in normal development.",""

"global wood anatomical perspective on the onset of the late antique little ice age (lalia) in the mid-6th century ce","2022","Linked to major volcanic eruptions around 536 and 540 CE, the onset of the Late Antique Little Ice Age has been described as the coldest period of the past two millennia. The exact timing and spatial extent of this exceptional cold phase are, however, still under debate because of the limited resolution and geographical distribution of the available proxy archives. Here, we use 106 wood anatomical thin sections from 23 forest sites and 20 tree species in both hemispheres to search for cell-level fingerprints of ephemeral summer cooling between 530 and 550 CE. After cross-dating and double-staining, we identified 89 Blue Rings (lack of cell wall lignification), nine Frost Rings (cell deformation and collapse), and 93 Light Rings (reduced cell wall thickening) in the Northern Hemisphere. Our network reveals evidence for the strongest temperature depression between mid-July and early-August 536 CE across North America and Eurasia, whereas more localised cold spells occurred in the summers of 532, 540–43, and 548 CE. The lack of anatomical signatures in the austral trees suggests limited incursion of stratospheric volcanic aerosol into the Southern Hemisphere extra-tropics, that any forcing was mitigated by atmosphere-ocean dynamical responses and/or concentrated outside the growing season, or a combination of factors.

"building datacube for maritime applications on discrete global grid system","2022","Geospatial analysis often requires heterogeneous datasets of large volume or coverage which are not well suited to traditional data structures. Data cubes built upon Discrete Global Grid Systems (DGGS) seems to be an efficient way to manage big geospatial data. DGGS provide a uniform multiresolution spatial reference system and an efficient framework for building data cubes. The latter enables users to structure various data and provides analysis ready data for data processing, machine learning and visualization. In this study we introduce the methodology of data cube creation for marine research in Russian Arctic seas with H3 DGGS package and PostgreSQL using the R package â€œsfâ€™ and Python module for H3 â€œh3-pyâ€.

"security in iot-enabled digital twins of maritime transportation systems","2023","The purposes are to explore the safety performance of the Maritime Transportation System (MTS) based on Digital Twins (DTs) Internet of Things (IoT) and develop maritime transportation towards intelligence and digitalization. Because the comprehensive operational security of modern MTS is not yet mature, historical transportation data of the Maritime Silk Road are acquired and preprocessed. Afterward, DTs are introduced, and relay nodes are added to data transmission paths to construct a maritime transportation DTs model based on relay cooperation IoT. Eventually, this modelâ€™s security performance is validated through simulation experiments. Relay security analysis suggests that interference information is a vital guarantee to assist in information non-disclosure, from which the constructed model can harvest energy to increase the data transmission power, thereby improving communication performance and secrecy rate. Outage probability analysis reveals that the simulated and the theoretical results are almost the same; moreover, given the systemâ€™s multi-hop paths in the same environment, the more the relays and the greater the fading index, the better the system performance and the lower the outage probability. Once the iterations reach a particular number, the node secrecy rate becomes optimal and cannot cause excessive burden to the system; besides, the power distribution can establish a new equilibrium when the nodes are in different locations, so that system security performance gets improved. The simulated value is closest to the actual result under 100% successful transmission probability and  $0.01\sim 0.05~\lambda $  value. To sum up, the constructed maritime transportation DTs model presents extraordinary transmission and security performance, providing an experimental basis for intelligent and secure maritime transportation in the future.","telecommunication network reliability,telecommunication security,telecommunication power management,Maritime Transportation System,Transportation,secure maritime transportation,historical transportation data,maritime transportation systems,Internet of Things,intelligent maritime transportation,Marine vehicles,maritime transportation DTs model,data transmission paths,relay nodes,IoT-enabled digital twins,Radio frequency,Maritime Silk Road,digital twins,comprehensive operational security,outage probability analysis,Relays,digitalization,relay cooperation IoT,node secrecy rate,communication performance,wireless channels,safety performance,relay security analysis,system performance,system security performance,cooperative communication,probability,Digital Twins Internet,data transmission power,Sensors,relay cooperation,Digital twins,Security,maritime transportation system,maritime silk road,"

"timing of major forest compositional changes and tree expansions in the retezat mts during the last 16,000 years","2018","This paper focuses on the Late Glacial (LG) and Holocene regional and local establishment times of several tree and shrub species in the Retezat Mountains (South Carpathians) using pollen, stomata and plant macrofossil records from four lakes situated at different altitudes. We used the empirical and rational pollen percentage limits to infer the local presence and population expansion/recession times. Our results show that Pinus mugo and P. sylvestris spread first at 15,100 cal yr BP in the mountain. P. mugo arrived at high altitudes (1740 m) already at 13,600 cal yr BP. The expansion of Larix decidua was weakly recorded in the pollen diagrams, but the plant macrofossil and stomata records suggested its Late Glacial expansion mainly on the northern slope and local presence since 14,900 cal yr BP at 1740 m. The species likely went extinct in the Late Holocene (around 3330 cal yr BP). The expansion of Picea abies and Ulmus commenced earlier on the southern slope, from 15,200 to 14,400 cal yr BP respectively, compared to the northern slope, where these species expanded from 14,300 to 13,850 cal yr BP. The following step was the expansion of Quercus at 13,900 cal yr BP. Following the Younger Dryas decrease of temperate deciduous taxa and P. abies, their expansion on the northern flank was in the order of P. abies (11,750), Ulmus (11,600), Quercus (11,100), Corylus (10,600), Carpinus betulus (7100), Abies alba (5100) and Fagus sylvatica (5000 cal yr BP). Timing of the Early Holocene tree expansions on the southern flank is ambiguous due to uncertainties in the Early Holocene age-depth model of Lake Lia; however, the mid-Holocene expansion of C. betulus and A. alba were well-dated in both southern slope pollen records to 7700 and 6100 cal yr BP, respectively, and we inferred several hundred years earlier expansion on the southern flank that can be explained by climatic differences. Higher solar radiation results in longer growing seasons and milder winters on the southern flank, which likely facilitated the earlier spread of these trees. For several woody taxa studied in this paper, last glacial maximum refugial populations can be inferred either locally in the mountain (P. abies, P. mugo, P. sylvestris, L. decidua) or in the region (Quercus, Ulmus, C. betulus, F. sylvatica) on the basis of their pollen presence since at least 15,700–16,000 cal yr BP and early increase during the LG. We compared the pollen inferred population expansion times of several tree taxa along a south-north transect in the Romanian Carpathians, and found that the Early Holocene high altitude expansion of A. alba (10,650–9400 cal yr BP) is exceptional in the region. We also demonstrated that the Holocene mass expansion of Quercus and C. avellana started earliest in the Retezat, and at least two centuries later in other sites in the Romanian Carpathians. We also demonstrated that certain tree species had preference for survival and/or early expansion on the northern slopes (A. alba, L. decidua, F. sylvatica), while others on the southern slopes (C. avellana, C. betulus).","Postglacial forest succession,Plant macrofossils,Expansion times,Carpathian Mountains,Pollen analysis,"
"3-d multiobjective deployment of an industrial wireless sensor network for maritime applications utilizing a distributed parallel algorithm","2018","Effectively monitoring maritime environments has become a vital problem in maritime applications. Traditional methods are not only expensive and time consuming but also restricted in both time and space. More recently, the concept of an industrial wireless sensor network (IWSN) has become a promising alternative for monitoring next-generation intelligent maritime grids, because IWSNs are cost-effective and easy to deploy. This paper focuses on solving the issue of 3-D IWSN deployment in a 3-D engine room space of a very large crude-oil carrier and also considers numerous power facilities. To address this 3-D IWSN deployment problem for maritime applications, a 3-D uncertain coverage model is proposed that uses a modified 3-D sensing model and an uncertain fusion operator. The deployment problem is converted into a multiobjective optimization problem that simultaneously addresses three objectives: coverage, lifetime, and reliability. Our goal is to achieve extensive coverage, long network lifetime, and high reliability. We also propose a distributed parallel cooperative coevolutionary multiobjective large-scale evolutionary algorithm for maritime applications. We verify the effectiveness of this algorithm through experiments by comparing it with five state-of-the-art algorithms. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed method performs most effectively both in optimization performance and in minimizing the computation time.","distributed parallel algorithm,wireless sensor network deployment,evolutionary computation,Wireless sensor networks,3-D engine room,3-D sensing model,distributed parallel cooperative coevolutionary multiobjective large-scale evolutionary algorithm,wireless sensor networks,Three-dimensional displays,maritime environments,very large crude-oil carrier (VLCC),parallel algorithms,industrial wireless sensor network,maritime applications,multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA),3D multiobjective deployment,multiobjective optimization problem,Optimization,IWSN,next-generation intelligent maritime grids,marine communication,Algorithm design and analysis,Sensors,3-D engine room space,long network lifetime,Evolutionary computation,3-D uncertain coverage model,cooperative systems,"

The proposed method is based on the representation of a ship's velocity with an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process and on the detection of changes of its long-run mean to identify navigational way-points. In order to assess the graph representativeness of the traffic, two performance metrics are introduced, leading to distinct graph construction criteria.

"tightly coupled, graph-based dvl/imu fusion and decoupled mapping for slam-centric maritime infrastructure inspection","2023","In this article, we address the problem of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM)-centric maritime infrastructure inspection [using unmanned surface vehicles (USVs)] via novel approaches in tightly-coupled, graph-based DVL/IMU fusion and decoupled mapping. As our first contribution, we formalize the preintegration of linear velocity measurements, obtained by a Doppler velocity log (DVL), in combination with angular velocity measurements, obtained by an inertial measurement unit (IMU), as binary factors encoding relative position. To evaluate state estimation improvements imparted by DVL/IMU fusion, we implement our proposed factor within a state-of-the-art, graph-based lidar-visual-inertial (LVI) SLAM system as our second contribution. Accuracy and robustness improvements are demonstrated in simulation by comparing maximum a posteriori pose estimates with and without DVL/IMU fusion against ground truth poses. As our third contribution, we propose a map generation framework for downstream inspection applications decoupled from SLAM. In our framework, volumetric data (captured by sonar, lidar, etc.) is transformed into a common world coordinate frame using extrinsic calibrations and SLAM pose estimates as input. Our framework operates over the complete set of raw volumetric data, whereas SLAM systems (both online and offline) typically operate over a subset of down-sampled volumetric data. To address the processing of additional volumetric data, we present innovations in refined pose correction and staged filtering for user-controlled denoising.

"deep learning applied to road accident detection with transfer learning and synthetic images","2022","Artificial Intelligence (AI) has driven solutions in diverse areas; one of the most prominent fields is Computer Vision (CV). Accordingly, solutions to effectively detect road accidents can be a game-changer for road safety. The focus is on Vision Zero, i.e., eliminate all traffic fatalities and severe injuries. However, when an accident occurs, response time is essential. Several countries have surveillance cameras monitoring the road network. However, real-time monitoring requires a considerable number of people with training and attention. Our solution automates this with AI, using deep learning to train a model to detect potential accidents. The CV method based on binary image classification was used, being images without accidents classified as normal and images with accidents as alarm. The biggest challenge in developing the model was obtaining images of accidents from the analyzed cameras. The solution adopted was to create synthetic images of these rare events. Several architectures of Convolutional Neural Networks were tested, and it was found that the best approach was to use transfer learning. As base models for transfer learning, the best results were EfficientNetB1 and MobileNetV2. The former for its quality in prediction and the latter for its size and execution speed. As a case study, open data images from Finnish road surveillance cameras were used, provided every ten minutes. Finally, it was found that the solution trained with EfficientNetB1 as the base model has a Mean Average Precision (mAP) of 0.89 and a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.77. The solution based on MobileNetV2 has an mAP of 0.88 and an MCC of 0.71.","Road Accidents,Computer Vision,Deep Learning,Image Classification,Transfer Learning,Synthetic Data,"
"urban coral reefs: degradation and resilience of hard coral assemblages in coastal cities of east and southeast asia","2018","Given predicted increases in urbanization in tropical and subtropical regions, understanding the processes shaping urban coral reefs may be essential for anticipating future conservation challenges. We used a case study approach to identify unifying patterns of urban coral reefs and clarify the effects of urbanization on hard coral assemblages. Data were compiled from 11 cities throughout East and Southeast Asia, with particular focus on Singapore, Jakarta, Hong Kong, and Naha (Okinawa). Our review highlights several key characteristics of urban coral reefs, including “reef compression” (a decline in bathymetric range with increasing turbidity and decreasing water clarity over time and relative to shore), dominance by domed coral growth forms and low reef complexity, variable city-specific inshore-offshore gradients, early declines in coral cover with recent fluctuating periods of acute impacts and rapid recovery, and colonization of urban infrastructure by hard corals. We present hypotheses for urban reef community dynamics and discuss potential of ecological engineering for corals in urban areas.","Pollution,Urban ecology,Urbanization,Reef compression,Reef restoration,"
"retrieving the stand age from a retrospective detection of multinannual forest changes using landsat data. application on the heavily managed maritime pine forest in southwestern france from a 30-year landsat time-series (1984â€“2014)","2015","The availability of Landsat data (Landsat 4, 5, 7 and 8) from ~30 years makes it possible to analyze the forest long term dynamics at high resolution (30m). The performances of the Landsat time-series have been already demonstrated for mapping and monitoring the annual clear-cuts and the storm damage in the Landes Forest, that covers ~1 million ha in southwestern France and that is heavily managed with even-aged stands with rather short rotations after clear-cut harvesting. Our objectives aimed at improving, automating, and enriching these previous methods. This was to operationally produce over the whole Landes Forest not only (1) the annual maps of clear-cutting from 1984 up the current year but also (2) the map of the current age that was derived from the forest change detected every year since 1984. The developed methodology used the time-series of surface reflectance and cloud mask provided for Landsat by USGS and sought to cope the possible absence of cloud-free image during the interest season or the numerous missing data in Landsat 7 images after 2002.

"using nfts and blockchain for traceability and auctioning of shipping containers and cargo in maritime industry","2022","The maritime industry is a complex multi-tiered sector that plays a major role in international shipping and trade. Seaborne transportation is responsible for 90% of goods moved globally, and containerized shipments account for more than 50% of those goods. This volume of movement requires efficient tracking and traceability methods that secure the documentation process and ensure the involved stakeholders. However, due to its complexity, the maritime industry suffers from a lack of trust, lack of ownership evidence, protracted documentation procedures, and excessive data aggregation. These shortcomings are reflected in delays and elevated costs in the shipping process. To mitigate these problems, we propose in this paper a blockchain-based solution for the ownership history and traceability of shipping containers in the industry. Our solution utilizes smart contracts and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Ethereum blockchain to accelerate the inefficient shipping process by digitizing ownership transfer and process documentation. Furthermore, the proposed system allows the owners to auction off their cargo in the destination ports, freeing warehouses and containers in the process. We analyze our proposed system in terms of transaction costs and smart contract security. The smart contracts are developed using the Solidity language in the Remix IDE and the code is made publicly available on GitHub.","Seaports,Blockchains,NFTs,auctioning,Blockchain,Ethereum,Costs,Smart contracts,supply chain,maritime shipping,Documentation,Containers,shipping containers,Decentralized applications,Supply chains,"
"a comparison framework for runtime monitoring approaches","2017","The full behavior of complex software systems often only emerges during operation. They thus need to be monitored at run time to check that they adhere to their requirements. Diverse runtime monitoring approaches have been developed in various domains and for different purposes. Their sheer number and heterogeneity, however, make it hard to find the right approach for a specific application or purpose. The aim of our research therefore was to develop a comparison framework for runtime monitoring approaches. Our framework is based on an analysis of the literature and existing taxonomies for monitoring languages and patterns. We use examples from existing monitoring approaches to explain the framework. We demonstrate its usefulness by applying it to 32 existing approaches and by comparing 3 selected approaches in the light of different monitoring scenarios. We also discuss perspectives for researchers.","Comparison framework,Runtime monitoring,Literature review,"
"assessment of offshore oil/gas platform status in the northern gulf of mexico using multi-source satellite time-series images","2018","Accurate knowledge of the detailed status (location and lifetime) of each oil/gas platform is crucial for ocean management and for understanding its potential environmental impact. However, this requirement is often compromised due to incomplete data records, especially when platform abandonment is not properly planned, designed, and/or executed. The availability of multi-source optical and SAR images provides the possibility of a systematic assessment, but the ubiquitous false positives and frequent geocoding errors make it technically challenging. Here, we develop a time-series remote sensing approach (TSRS) for detecting offshore platforms and determining their status, where the technical challenges are overcome using two strategies, as follows: (i) A stepwise optimization strategy applied to individual images and time-series images to mitigate numerous noises, to select platforms from candidates, and to assess platform status; and (ii) A cross geo-correction strategy using platforms derived from high-geometric accuracy images as ground control points to rectify poorly geo-referenced images. We applied the TSRS approach to the northern Gulf of Mexico using about 26,000 moderate-resolution optical/SAR images from eight satellites spanning the period from 1982 to 2017. TSRS detected a total of 9260 (5556) platforms in both Federal and State waters, including 3140 (1803) existing platforms, 5044 (3426) removed platforms, and 1076 (327) status-to-be-determined platforms where the numbers in parentheses represent those from Federal waters. Of these TSRS platforms, 4751 coincide spatially with 5476 (77.68%) of platform records of the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) platform database; 2846 (387 in Federal waters) are not found in the BSEE platform database but are convincingly supported by data from other sources (including BSEE-pipeline-database, time-series VIIRS nighttime light products, and littoral ground-truth images), meaning that 82.04% of the TSRS-derived platforms can be directly/indirectly confirmed. A site-specific validation in East Bay using multi-temporal ground-truth aerial images indicates that, for this site, the false negative rate (FNR) is ~9.63% and the false positive rate (FPR) is only 4.44%. The detailed beginning/end dates of the TSRS platforms are mostly confirmed by the corresponding Installation/Site-clear dates recorded in the BSEE platform database. Our findings suggest that the TSRS approach is a robust and cost-effective way to assess oil/gas platform status in large regions, and our results here may complement the official database, narrow down locations for future field investigations, and provide critical information for future assessment of the potential impacts of active and decommissioned platforms on the marine environments.","Landsat,Northern Gulf of Mexico,Offshore platform,Platform status assessment,Remote sensing,SAR,Time-series,"

We introduce the key notions of the PI vision and expand on the unique position of maritime ports in the PI with the respective challenges this may create. Finally, we discuss the requirements for maritime ports to be ready to take up their role in the PI.

"machine learning-assisted anomaly detection in maritime navigation using ais data","2020","The automatic identification system (AIS) reports vessels' static and dynamic information, which are essential for maritime traffic situation awareness. However, AIS transponders can be switched off to hide suspicious activities, such as illegal fishing, or piracy. Therefore, this paper uses real world AIS data to analyze the possibility of successful detection of various anomalies in the maritime domain. We propose a multi-class artificial neural network (ANN)-based anomaly detection framework to classify intentional and non-intentional AIS on-off switching anomalies. The multi-class anomaly framework captures AIS message dropouts due to various reasons, e.g., channel effects or intentional one for carrying illegal activities. We extract position, speed, course and timing information from real world AIS data, and use them to train a 2-class (normal and anomaly) and a 3-class (normal, power outage and anomaly) anomaly detection models. Our results show that the models achieve around 99.9% overall accuracy, and are able to classify a test sample in the order of microseconds.","security of data,maritime traffic situation awareness,multiclass anomaly framework,pattern classification,multiclass artificial neural network,AIS message dropouts,neural nets,illegal fishing,learning (artificial intelligence),illegal activities,ships,automatic identification system,marine engineering,machine learning-assisted anomaly detection,maritime navigation,AIS transponders,"

"a shift in the diurnal timing and intensity of deep convection over the congo basin during the past 40 years","2021","The Congo Basin, one of the three most convective regions in the world, has recently experienced a large-scale drying trend accompanied by an increase in thunderstorm activity. This study analyzes changes in the diurnal variations of cloudiness and deep convection from 1979 to 2019 over the Congo, evaluates their associations with trends in precipitation efficiency, and explores their possible connections to the observed decrease in precipitation. Analyses of GridSat-B1 and MODIS satellite datasets in conjunction with ERA5 reanalysis data show that cloud cover has decreased, and brightness temperature (Tb) has increased during the morning hours, while convective activity has increased and Tb has decreased during the afternoon hours, possibly due to the observed warming and drying trend over the Congo. The combined effects of decreasing clouds during the morning and the subsequent increasing convection during the afternoon have led to an amplification of the diurnal amplitude in Tb over the Congo. Our results also indicate a decrease in precipitation efficiency and an increase in cloud base height. Such changes may be attributable to the Congo drought as increased surface temperatures and decreased surface relative humidity would raise the lifted condensation level, and thus increase the cloud base height and decrease the precipitation efficiency. This positive-feedback mechanism may ultimately result in the observed decrease of precipitation at the surface, further accelerating the drying trend over the Congo.","Rainfall,Tropical convection,Congo rainforest,Diurnal cycle,"
"assessing the state of marine biodiversity in the northeast atlantic","2022","The Northeast Atlantic, a highly productive maritime area, has been exposed to a wide range of direct human pressures, such as fishing, shipping, coastal development, pollution, and non-indigenous species (NIS) introductions, in addition to anthropogenically-driven global climate change. Nonetheless, this regional sea supports a high diversity of species and habitats, whose functioning provides a variety of ecosystem services, essential for human welfare. In 2017, OSPAR, the Northeast Atlantic Regional Seas Commission, delivered an assessment of marine biodiversity for the Northeast Atlantic. This assessment examined biodiversity indicators separately to identify changes in Northeast Atlantic biodiversity, but stopped short of determining the status of biodiversity for many species and habitats. Here, we expand on this work and for the first time, a semi-quantitative approach is applied to evaluate holistically the state of Northeast Atlantic marine biodiversity across marine food webs, from plankton to top predators, via fish, pelagic and benthic habitats, including xeno-biodiversity (i.e. NIS). Our analysis reveals widespread degradation in marine ecosystems and biodiversity, particularly for marine birds and coastal bottlenose dolphins, as well as for benthic habitats and fish in some regions. The poor biodiversity status of these ecosystem components is likely the result of cumulative effects of human activities, such as habitat destruction or disturbance, overexploitation, eutrophication, the introduction of NIS, and climate change. Bright spots are also revealed, such as recent signs of recovery in some fish and marine bird communities and recovery in harbour and grey seal populations and the condition of coastal benthic communities in some regions. The status of many indicators across all ecosystem components, but particularly for the novel pelagic habitats, food webs and NIS indicators, however, remains uncertain due to gaps in data, unclear pressure-state relationships, and the non-linear influence of some pressures on biodiversity indicators. Improving monitoring and data access and increasing understanding of pressure-state relationships, including those that are non-linear, is therefore a priority for enabling future assessments, as is consistent and stable resourcing for expert involvement.","Ecosystem approach,Indicators,Marine Strategy Framework Directive,Holistic assessment,Anthropogenic pressures,Food webs,"
"unseen annihilation: illegal fishing practices and nautical patrol","2023","A host of regulations should protect fish, a common-pool resource, from overexploitation, but detecting violations of these regulations is challenging, both at sea and in port. We present a novel approach to uncover a supposedly widespread and particularly harmful illegal fishing practice, the use of nets with illegally small mesh size. Our approach relies on readily available data on reported fish landings. We focus on bottom trawling, the world’s most widely used fishing method. We exploit the fact that using illegally small mesh size increases the share of small fish in the catch. Using quasi-random variation in nautical patrol as a source of variation in the incentive to comply, we show that in weeks without patrol the share of small fish in the landed catch is systematically larger than in adjacent weeks with patrol. Our results are in line with widespread use of illegally small mesh. The resulting catch and discard of juvenile fish is many times larger than the gain in the catch of marketable fish. This harm has thus far been largely ignored in estimates of the externalities from fishing.","Environmental economics,Fisheries,Enforcement,Regulation,"
"seasonal dependence of rainfall extremes in and around jakarta, indonesia","2019","This study investigates the interannual, seasonal, and intraseasonal variation in rainfall extremes (REs) in Jakarta and surroundings. We used datasets of daily rainfall at three sites at coastal, inland and mountainous environments during 1974–2016 (42 years), Sea Surface Temperature, 850-hPa zonal and meridional winds, and Outgoing Longwave Radiation during 1979–2016 (37 years). The results show that intensity and frequency of REs, and their relative contribution to the total rainfall, have strong relationships with the Indian Ocean Dipole and El Niño Southern Oscillation in the dry season (Jun–Nov) but weak relationships in the wet season (Dec–May) at all sites. During active Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) period, the daily average rainfall and the number of RE days relative to all days show strong variation between MJO phases at all sites and the MJO signature differs between the three stations. At the coastal and inland sites, there is a less marked variation of the number of RE events relative to all days with MJO phases. Compared to lower altitudes, the high-altitude station has a greater number of RE events relative to all days in the wet season and a lower intensity of REs relative to total rainfall amount in the dry season. The results of the study suggest that the REs vary in each station due to highly localised differences in responses to large-scale conditions.","IOD,Seasonal dependence,ENSO,MJO,Rainfall extremes,"
"temporal characterization and regional contribution to o3 and nox at an urban and a suburban site in nanjing, china","2016","To improve our understanding of the interplay among local and regional photochemical pollutants in the typical city of the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region, the concurrent observation of O3 and NOx concentrations at an urban and a suburban site in Nanjing during 2008 is presented. In general, the annual mean O3 concentration is 2.35ppbv lower in the downtown than at suburban due to higher NOx pollution levels correlated with heavy traffic. At both sites, O3 shows a distinct seasonality with the spring maximum and the winter minimum, while the minimum concentration of NOx appears in summertime. Besides the chemical processes of O3 sensitivity in the daytime and the NOx titration at night, meteorological conditions also play an essential role in these monthly and diurnal variations. The ozone weekend effect that can be attributed to the weekly routine of human activities is observed in the urban atmosphere of Nanjing as well, with O3 concentrations 2.09ppbv higher and NOx concentrations 6.20ppbv lower on weekends than on weekdays. The chemical coupling of NO, NO2 and O3 is investigated to show that the OX-component (O3 and NO2) partitioning point occurs at about 35ppbv for NOx, with O3 being the dominant form at lower levels and NO2 dominating at higher levels. And it is also discovered that the level of OX is made up of two contributions, including the regional contribution affected by regional background O3 level and the local contribution correlated with the level of primary pollution. The diurnal peak of regional contribution appears 2–5h after the peak of local contribution, implying that OX in Nanjing might prominently affected by the pollutants from a short distance. The highest regional contribution and the second highest local contribution lead to the spring peak of O3 observed in Nanjing, whereas the highest local contribution and the moderate regional contribution make the O3 concentrations in summer higher than those in autumn and winter. Our results reveal the important environment impacts from meteorological conditions and human activities in the YRD region, and can help to understand O3 pollution in these polluted areas by just using the conventional observations.","Ozone,Nitrogen oxides,Weekend effect,Regional pollution,Photochemical oxidant,Local pollution,"
"cognitively-inspired motion pattern learning & analysis algorithms for higher-level fusion and automated scene understanding","2007","We have developed a suite of neurobiologically inspired algorithms for exploiting track data to learn normal patterns of motion behavior, detect deviations from normalcy, and predict future behavior. These capabilities contribute to higher-level fusion situational awareness and assessment objectives. They also provide essential elements for automated scene understanding to shift operator focus from sensor monitoring and activity detection to assessment and response. Our learning algorithms learn behavioral patterns at a variety of conceptual, spatial, and temporal levels to reduce a massive amount of track data to a rich set of information regarding their field of regard that supports decision-making and timely response initiation. Continuous incremental learning enables the models of normal behavior to adapt well to evolving situations while maintaining high levels of performance. Deviations from normalcy result in reports being published directly to operator displays or to other reasoning components within a larger system. Deviation tolerance levels are user settable during system operation to tune alerting sensitivity. Operator (or other system component) responses to anomaly alerts can be fed back into the algorithms to further enhance and refine learned models. These algorithms have been successfully demonstrated to learn vessel behaviors across the maritime domain and to learn vehicle and dismount behavior in land-based settings.","Motion detection,Pattern analysis,Decision making,Algorithm design and analysis,Layout,Motion analysis,Computerized monitoring,Displays,Vehicles,Tracking,"
"summer bloom of vulcanodinium rugosum in cienfuegos bay (cuba) associated to dermatitis in swimmers","2021","The marine dinoflagellate Vulcanodinium rugosum produces powerful paralyzing and cytotoxic compounds named pinnatoxins (PnTX) and portimines. Even though, no related human intoxication episodes following direct exposure in seawater or the ingestion of contaminated seafood have been documented so far. This study aimed at investigating a dinoflagellate bloom linked to acute dermatitis cases in two recreational beaches in Cienfuegos Bay, Cuba. We used epidemiological and clinical data from 60 dermatitis cases consisting of individuals in close contact with the bloom. Seawater physical-chemical properties were described, and the microorganism causing the bloom was identified by means of light and scanning electron microscopy. Morphological identification was confirmed genetically by sequencing the internal transcribed spacers ITS1 and ITS2, and the 5.8S rDNA region. Toxic compounds were identified from a bloom extract using liquid chromatography (LC) coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS), and their concentrations were estimated based on low-resolution tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Sixty people who had prolonged contact with the dinoflagellate bloom suffered acute dermal irritation. Most patients (79.2%) were children and had to be treated with antibiotics; some required >5-day hospitalization. Combined morphological and genetic characters indicated V. rugosum as the causative agent of the bloom. rDNA sequences of the V. rugosum genotype found in the bloom aligned with others from Asia, including material found in the ballast tank of a ship in Florida. The predominant toxins in the bloom were portimine, PnTX-F and PnTX-E, similar to strains originating from the Pacific Ocean. This bloom was associated with unusual weather conditions such as frequent and prolonged droughts. Our findings indicate a close link between the V. rugosum bloom and a dermatitis outbreak among swimmers in Cienfuegos Bay. Phylogenetic evidence suggests a recent introduction of V. rugosum from the Pacific Ocean into Caribbean waters, possibly via ballast water.","Microbial biogeography,Harmful algal bloom,Human health,Emergent toxin,Toxic dinoflagellate,Skin irritation,"
"halophyte die-off in response to anthropogenic impacts on tidal flats","2014","This study analyzed an abrupt change in halophyte populations, especially the annual plant Suaeda japonica. The boundaries and distributions of S. japonica and Phragmites australis were determined based on the decision tree classifier of TerraSAR-X, SAVI of Landsat ETM+, and density slicing of aerial photography. A large patch of S. japonica in the eastern parts of Donggum-do, South Korea, disappeared in 2007, while populations have been stable in the western parts of the island. To understand the reason behind the sudden die-off, mean sea level was analyzed based on gaged tidal data. Sedimentation rate was measured using Vernier caliper and RTK leveling data. Sedimentation rate between 2006 and 2007 was above the threshold at which S. japonica can germinate. After the loss of an 11-ha S. japonica patch from the eastern part of Donggum-do, sedimentation was accelerated because of a decrease in tidal current caused by a series of land reclamation projects. The increased monthly exposure duration due to continuous sediment accretion altered the type of salt marsh. Our results imply that accumulated effects from a series of coastal construction projects around Ganghwa-do can change not only tide and current hydrodynamics, but also sedimentation and erosion rates, which can cause large halophyte patches to disappear.","halophyte,sedimentation,tidal flat,salt marsh,"
"using satellite image analysis for locating prehistoric archaeological sites in alaska's central brooks range","2015","In this pilot study, we apply satellite image analysis to archaeological site prospection in Alaska's Brooks Range. Our goal was to test whether satellite remote sensing, which has been successful in locating large archaeological features associated with sedentary peoples, could be applied to arctic interior sites associated with mobile hunter–gatherers. In particular, we strove to develop a relatively straightforward and inexpensive model using existing data which could be used to help guide archaeology surveys. Using 1-m resolution IKONOS imagery of Lake Matcharak along the upper Noatak River, we produced a Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and tasseled cap transformation of the study area and stacked these five vegetation indices into one image. We then applied unsupervised and supervised classifications to the image first, to test for the presence of a site-specific spectral class and second, determine the nature of that class. Through a visual analysis of the unsupervised classification, a spectral phenomenon was seen to co-occur with archaeological sites in the study area. The supervised classification provided a high-resolution land cover map used to identify the signature as the ecotone between un-vegetated sediments and dense willow (Salix sp.) stands. Dense willow stands along the Lake Matcharak shore visually correlate with most of the known archaeological sites, possibly reflecting landform and/or vegetation characteristics that would have appealed to past inhabitants. The methods described here could contribute to building better survey strategies and archaeological predictive models for elsewhere in the Brooks Range and Alaska.","Site prospection,Archaeology,Multi-spectral analysis,Satellite imagery,Hunter–gatherers,Prehistoric sites,Alaska,Site reconnaissance,Arctic,"
"hybrid bernoulli filtering for detection and tracking of anomalous path deviations","2018","This paper presents a solution to the problem of sequential joint anomaly detection and tracking of a target subject to switching unknown path deviations. Based on a dynamic model described by Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) stochastic processes, the anomaly is represented by a target (e.g., a marine vessel) that deviates from a preset route by changing its nominal mean velocity. The Random Finite Set (RFS) framework is used to represent the switching nature of target's anomalous behavior in the presence of spurious measurements and detection uncertainty. Combining these two ingredients, the problem of jointly detecting target's path deviations and estimating its kinematic state can be formulated within the Bayesian framework, and analytically solved by means of a hybrid Bernoulli filter that sequentially updates the joint posterior density of the unknown OU velocity input (a Bernoulli RFS) and of the target's state random vector. We illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed filter, implemented in Gaussian-mixture form, in a simulated scenario of vessel tracking for maritime traffic monitoring.","Anomaly detection,switching nature,state random vector,Sea measurements,Stochastic processes,Radio frequency,vessel tracking,hybrid Bernoulli filtering,target tracking,Random Finite Set framework,stochastic processes,filtering theory,hybrid Bernoulli filter,Target tracking,object detection,Gaussian processes,Bayesian framework,Artificial intelligence,anomalous path deviations,unknown OU velocity input,nominal mean velocity,Surveillance,marine vessel,joint posterior density,sequential joint anomaly detection,"

"rapid precipitation changes in the tropical west pacific linked to north atlantic climate forcing during the last deglaciation","2018","The cause of rapid hydrological changes in the tropical West Pacific during the last deglaciation remains controversial. In order to test whether these changes were triggered by abrupt climate change events in the North Atlantic Ocean, variations in precipitation during the last deglaciation (18–10 ka) were extracted from proxy records of chemical weathering and terrigenous input in the western Philippine Sea (WPS). The evolution of chemical weathering and terrigenous input since 27 ka was reconstructed using the chemical index of alteration (CIA), elemental ratios (K/Al, TOC/TN and Ti/Ca), δ13Corg, terrigenous fraction abundance and flux data from International Marine Global Change Study Program (IMAGES) core MD06-3054 collected on the upper continental slope of eastern Luzon (northern Philippines). Sediment deposited during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) shows weathering equal to or slightly greater than Holocene sediment in the WPS. This unusual state of chemical weathering, which is inconsistent with lower air temperatures and decreased precipitation in Luzon during the LGM, may be due to reworking of poorly consolidated sediments on the eastern Luzon continental shelf during the LGM sea-level lowstand. Rapid changes in chemical weathering, characterized by higher intensity during the Heinrich event 1 (H1) and Younger Dryas (YD) and lower intensity during the Bølling-Allerød (B/A), were linked to rapid variations in precipitation in the WPS during the last deglaciation. The higher terrigenous inputs during the LGM relative to those of the Holocene were controlled by sea-level changes rather than precipitation. The terrigenous inputs show a long-term decline during the last deglaciation, punctuated by brief spikes during the H1 and YD related to sea-level rises and rapid precipitation changes in the WPS, respectively. The proxy records of chemical weathering and terrigenous input from eastern Luzon suggest high rainfall during the H1 and YD events, consistent with inferred rainfall patterns based on Fe/Ca records from offshore Mindanao. Rapid precipitation changes in the WPS did not coincide with migrations of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) but, rather, were related to state shifts of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) during the last deglaciation. Based on proxy records and modeling results, we argue that the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) controlled rapid precipitation changes in the tropical West Pacific through zonal shifts of ENSO or meridional migration of the ITCZ during the last deglaciation. Our findings highlight the dominant role of the North Atlantic Ocean in the tropical hydrologic cycle during the last deglaciation.","Chemical weathering,ENSO,Terrigenous input,AMOC,Western Philippine sea,ITCZ,"
"framestep: a framework for annotating semantic trajectories based on episodes","2018","We are witnessing an increasing usage of location data by a variety of applications. Consequently, information systems are required to deal with large datasets containing raw data to build high level abstractions. Semantic Web technologies offer powerful representation tools for pervasive applications. The convergence of location-based services and Semantic Web standards allows an easier interlinking and annotation of trajectories. However, due to the wide range of requirements on modeling mobile object trajectories, it is important to define a high-level data model for representing trajectory episodes and contextual elements with multiple levels of granularity and different options to represent spatial and temporal extents, as well as to express quantitative and qualitative semantic descriptions. In this article, we focus on modeling mobile object trajectories in the context of Semantic Web. First, we introduce a new version of the Semantic Trajectory Episodes (STEP) ontology to represent generic spatiotemporal episodes. Then, we present FrameSTEP as a new framework for annotating semantic trajectories based on episodes. As a result, we combine our ontology, which can represent spatiotemporal phenomena at different levels of granularity, with annotation algorithms, which allow to create instances of our model. The proposed spatial annotation algorithm explores the Linked Open Data cloud and OpenStreetMap tags to find relevant types of spatial features in order to describe the environment where the trajectory took place. Our framework can guide the development of future expert systems in trajectory analysis. It enables reasoning about knowledge gathered from large trajectory data and linked datasets in order to create several intelligent services.","Semantic web,Trajectory modeling,Trajectory annotation,"
"the impact of circulation and dust deposition in controlling the distributions of dissolved fe and al in the south indian subtropical gyre","2015","The South Indian Subtropical Gyre (SISG) is one of the least studied gyre systems of the world ocean with respect to trace elements. Here we report dissolved (<0.45μm) Fe and Al measurements collected during two high-resolution US-CLIVAR CO2 Repeat Hydrography sections, which transected the upper 1000m of the gyre zonally along ~32°S (I05) and meridionally along ~30°E (I06S). Particulate Fe and Al concentrations in waters influenced by the Agulhas Current are also presented. The distributions of dissolved Fe and Al in the gyre are primarily impacted by mineral dust deposition at the surface and the large-scale circulation patterns of the gyre at depth. Using mean mixed layer dissolved Al concentrations, we estimate that the deposition and partial dissolution of mineral dust emanating from South Africa and Australia vary from 60 to 685mg (dust) m−2yr−1 across the 32°S transect. This translates into a dust source of dissolved Fe ranging from 1.7 to 20μmolFem−2y−1. The zonal patterns of aeolian deposition and those of N*, an indirect geochemical tracer for nitrogen fixation, show remarkable similarities along the I05 transect, suggesting that aeolian delivery of Fe may regulate nitrogen fixation rates in the SISG. In the western SISG (west of 60°E), which receives some of the highest aeolian Fe fluxes of the 32°S section, the Fe:AOU ratio in Indian Central Water was elevated relative to that observed in the Indian Central Water occupying the eastern Indian Ocean. These elevated Fe:AOU ratios may reflect the remineralization of Fe-rich organic material from nitrogen fixing organisms at the western end of the basin. Below the mixed layer, the distribution of dissolved Al appears to trace the principal features of the large-scale circulation of the SISG. Elevated subsurface concentrations of dissolved Al (>4nM) in the southwest Indian Ocean west of 45–50°E are most likely sustained by leakage of Al-rich waters from the Agulhas Return Current. Along the southeast African margin, the elevated particulate Fe (up to 230nM) and Al (up to 690nM) concentrations reflect the resuspension and transport of shelf sediments by the highly energetic Agulhas Current. However, while the particulate inputs at the margin are massive and appear to supply modest amounts of dissolved Fe, the distribution of dissolved Al is decoupled from the particulate phase. This observation suggests that the elevated subsurface dissolved Al concentrations observed near the African shelf are not the result of sediment resuspension processes occurring in situ along I05 but are more likely an advected signal originating from the upper reaches of the Agulhas Current.","CLIVAR,Al aluminium,Fe iron,Indian Ocean,"
"hybrid graph convolution neural network and branch-and-bound optimization for traffic flow forecasting","2023","In this study, we combine graph optimization and prediction in a single pipeline to investigate an innovative convolutional graph-based neural network for urban traffic flow prediction in an edge IoT environment. Pre-processing of the linked graph is first performed to remove noise from the set of original road networks of urban traffic data. Outlier detection strategy is used to efficiently explore the road network and remove irrelevant patterns and noise. The resulting graph is then implemented to train an extended graph convolutional neural network to estimate the traffic flow in the city. To accurately tune the hyperparameter values of the proposed framework, a new optimization technique is developed based on branch and bound. For comparison, an intensive evaluation is conducted with multiple datasets and baseline methods. The results show that the proposed framework outperforms the baseline solutions, especially when the number of nodes in the graph is large.","Forecasting,Deep learning,Graph convolution neural network,Smart roads,"
"a decade of satellite observations reveal significant increase in atmospheric formaldehyde from shipping in indian ocean","2021","Atmospheric formaldehyde (HCHO) is a potential pollutant and very harmful to public health at higher doses. There are different sources for HCHO in the atmosphere, in which fuel combustion and biomass burning are predominant. The oxidation of hydroxyl radicals (OH) and methane are the chemical production pathways of HCHO in the troposphere. Here, we show a different source of HCHO emission to the atmosphere; the maritime shipping. The analyses using satellite measurements for the period 2005–2014 reveal large amounts of HCHO release along the ship routes in Indian Ocean, about 7–8 x1015 molec./cm2. This is nearly twice (150–200%) the ambient or background HCHO levels (about 4 × 1015 molec./cm2), when there is no ship emissions in the north Indian Ocean. The trend in HCHO concentrations over the Indian Ocean sea routes is about 0.008 × 1015 molec./cm2/year. The amount and the increasing trends of HCHO over the maritime routes in the north Indian Ocean are also comparable to those of the busiest sea-lanes in the world Oceans, such as the Panama Canal, Mediterranean Sea and Strait of Malacca. Our analyses, henceforth, suggest use of a better fuel for shipping to reduce the maritime pollution, as the polluted air can often be transported to the coastal regions and islands, which is a concern for public health in those regions.","HCHO,India,Atmospheric pollution,Indian ocean,Shipping emissions,"

The considered anomaly is a vessel that deviates from a planned route, changing its nominal velocity. In order to hide this behavior, the vessel switches off its Automatic Identification System (AIS) device for a certain time, and then tries to revert to the previous nominal velocity. The decision that has to be taken is either declaring that a deviation happened or not, relying only upon two consecutive AIS contacts.

"drought-triggered western spruce budworm outbreaks in the interior pacific northwest: a multi-century dendrochronological record","2014","Douglas-fir forests in the interior Pacific Northwest are subject to sporadic outbreaks of the western spruce budworm, a species widely recognized as the most destructive defoliator in western North America. Outbreaks of the western spruce budworm often occur synchronously over broad regions and lead to widespread loss of leaf area and decrease in growth rates in affected stands. In spite of the ecological and economic significance of this defoliator, the mechanisms controlling this species’ population dynamics are still not fully understood. We used dendrochronological methods to reconstruct three centuries of western spruce budworm outbreaks at thirteen sites along a transect running from central Oregon to western Montana and compared the outbreak reconstructions with regional drought history. The reconstructions reveal repeated western spruce budworm outbreaks that sometimes persisted more than a decade and were significantly synchronous among sites. Synchrony was higher in the second half of the record, possibly due to changes in forest composition and structure brought about by land use practices. Across stands and regions, there was a moderately strong relationship between initiation of synchronous outbreaks and periods of transitional climate conditions in which moisture availability was below average prior to outbreak initiation, but above average in the first few years of an outbreak. There was a weak relationship between cessation of outbreaks and one or more years of high moisture availability. Outbreaks tended to occur near the end of droughts. The association between climatic variability and outbreak dynamics observed across this transect indicates that climate is an important driver of western spruce budworm outbreaks. Other factors that we did not test, but that may influence outbreak dynamics include stand structure, forest composition, predation, and phenological synchrony between larvae and host trees. Future changes in western spruce budworm outbreak dynamics will be determined by a combination of changing climate, interactions with other disturbance agents, and changing forest composition and structure. Our results suggest that western spruce budworm outbreaks will likely intensify if drought frequency increases in the future.","Dendrochronology,Pacific Northwest,Drought,Western spruce budworm,Defoliators,Insect outbreaks,"

"learning for prediction of maritime collision avoidance behavior from ais network","2021","With the rapid increase in global maritime shipping, there is a great demand for the technology of maritime traffic monitoring to detect inappropriate encountering interaction between ships and prevent ship collision accidents. The Automatic Identification System (AIS) network makes it possible to collect a large volume of maritime traffic data and investigate the collision avoidance behavior of real-world ships. Most collision avoidance systems are based on expert systems and simulations based on the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGs). Those regulations outline the general principles underlying collision avoidance; however, they do not provide specific guidance and fail to account for the complexity of many real-world situations. Furthermore, guidance systems coordinating the movement of a ship must have the capacity to predict the movement behavior of all ships involved in potential encounter situations, and do so as early as possible for anti-collision reaction. Our objective in this study was to model the collision avoidance behaviors of human operators in order to formulate a set of realistic trajectory predictions for encountering near collision scenarios. By machine learning approach, the proposed framework is able to learn a model of interaction movement behavior from collected AIS historical traffic data involving near collision situations and then generate a set of predicted trajectories while ships encountering. The proposed model eliminates the need for a priori information related to environmental conditions and the rules governing encounter situations. The resulting projections can be used to suggest anti-collision paths for navigators or to guide the selection of collision-free paths for maritime autonomous surface ships.","maritime traffic monitoring,collision-free paths,Regulation,maritime traffic data,Automatic Identification System network,collision avoidance systems,maritime autonomous surface ships,Marine vehicles,Machine learning,control engineering computing,Predictive models,AIS network,ships,marine safety,global maritime shipping,anti-collision paths,International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea,machine learning,Sea surface,expert systems,marine engineering computing,interaction movement behavior,encounter situation,Trajectory,collision avoidance behavior,trajectory prediction,AIS historical traffic data collection,ship collision accidents,Navigation,navigation,COLREG,collision avoidance,marine control,learning (artificial intelligence),maritime collision avoidance behavior prediction,"
"progress in space-borne studies of permafrost for climate science: towards a multi-ecv approach","2017","Remotely-sensed climate data records (CDRs) provide a basis for spatially distributed global climate model (GCM) inputs and validation methods. GCMs can take advantage of land surface models (LSMs), which aim to resolve surface energy, water and carbon budgets and hence these LSMs present important boundary conditions at the land-atmosphere interface. Pertinently, satellite data assimilation approaches are essential for improved land surface modelling for northern high latitudes ecosystems where permafrost degradation is reported to be ongoing. Permafrost, however, is an Essential Climate Variable (ECV) that cannot directly be monitored from space. Here, we advocate that CDRs, such as those compiled under the European Space Agency (ESA) Climate Change Initiative (CCI) programme, may be used in combination with permafrost models to improve our understanding of permafrost extent and degradation in a changing climate system. We describe the current types of remotely-sensed surface feature products that are widely used as indicators for permafrost related features. Furthermore, we highlight issues of using these site-specific permafrost proxies related to spatial scale, as well as the uncertainties in establishing present-day permafrost extent itself. Our assessment of the key ECVs that impact on permafrost, demonstrates how models that incorporate EO CDRs have the potential to boost our knowledge of permafrost conditions through better parametrisation of the thermal regime of permafrost soils.","EO CDR,Permafrost,ESA CCI,"
"demurrage pattern analysis using logical analysis of data: a case study of the ulsan port authority","2022","Maritime logistics, which accounts for around 80% of international trade around the world, has been a driving force for economic growth. Increases in maritime traffic, however, lead to increased congestion in berths and terminals. This congestion in turn negatively affects the total ship turnaround time and leads to decreased efficiency in port operations and a higher demurrage rate, which refers to the number of vessels in queue for more than a fixed time period waiting to load/unload out of the total number of vessels entering a port. The demurrage rate directly affects a port’s operating profits; thus, this rate needs to stay as low as possible. In this study, we focus on developing a methodology to address the demurrage rate of a port. To this end, we first collect two sets of vessel data (2016 annual data for training and 2019 annual data for validating) for ships entering and leaving the Port of Ulsan in the Republic of Korea and integrate these datasets with berth data and weather data. We tailor the logical analysis of data (LAD) technique to derive the patterns from the training data that mitigate or aggravate the demurrage rate. We use these patterns to predict the demurrage rate for the validating set of data. The overall binary classification results demonstrate the proposed LAD technique’s competitive performance, compared with other state-of-the-art machine learning methods. We then analyze the patterns to derive policy suggestions that can lower the demurrage rate at the Port of Ulsan. Our computational experiments find that the availability of tugs or pilots and port arrival times mainly affect the demurrage rate at the Port of Ulsan. Finally, our study showcases new possibilities for using patterns of demurrage and non-demurrage vessels obtained by LAD to help policymakers and port operators address the growing demurrage problem.","Maritime logistics,Maritime traffic data,Logical analysis of data,Port congestion,Demurrage rate,"
"understanding roman gold coinage inside out","2021","The true purity of Roman silver coinage was hidden by enriching the surfaces of the coins. The question investigated here is whether Roman gold coins were also surfaced enriched. Two non-destructive techniques were employed to do this: X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and a ‘newer’ technique, muonic X-ray emission spectroscopy (μXES). For the latter, the momentum of the muons is controlled, allowing for the composition of the coin to be determined at various depths. Here we show that there is no surface enrichment of the Roman gold coins analysed. Furthermore, we show that XRF and μXES return congruent results at the near surface. This all supports the integrity of surface level analyses of Roman gold coins. We then discuss the broader applicability of our muon technique to the further study of Roman gold coinage, to the cultural heritage sector and to archaeological scientists more generally.","XRF,Non-destructive,μXES,Gold,Roman,Muons,Purity,"
"discovering themes and trends in transportation research using topic modeling","2017","Transportation research is a key area in both science and engineering. In this paper, we present an empirical analysis of 17,163 articles published in 22 leading transportation journals from 1990 to 2015. We apply a latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model on article abstracts to infer 50 key topics. We show that those characterized topics are both representative and meaningful, mostly corresponding to established sub-fields in transportation research. These identified fields reveal a research landscape for transportation. Based on the results of LDA, we quantify the similarity of journals and countries/regions in terms of their aggregated topic distributions. By measuring the variation of topic distributions over time, we find some general research trends, such as topics on sustainability, travel behavior and non-motorized mobility are becoming increasingly popular over time. We also carry out this temporal analysis for each journal, observing a high degree of consistency for most journals. However, some interesting anomaly, such as special issues on particular topics, are detected from temporal variation as well. By quantifying the temporal trends at the country/region level, we find that countries/regions display clearly distinguishable patterns, suggesting that research communities in different regions tend to focus on different sub-fields. Our results could benefit different parties in the academic community—including researchers, journal editors and funding agencies—in terms of identifying promising research topics/projects, seeking for candidate journals for a submission, and realigning focus for journal development.","Research policy,Topic modeling,Transportation research,Publication data,"
"composition comparison of zhejiang longquan celadon and its imitation in dapu kiln of guangdong in the ming dynasty of china (1368–1644ce) by la-icp-ms","2018","Identification of Longquan celadon and its imitation is more and more caught the attention of experts in different fields. In this paper, by using laser ablation- inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) and other analytical methods, body and glaze of samples from Zhejiang Longquan celadon and its imitation in Dapu kiln of Guangdong in the Ming Dynasty of China were determined. Our research reveals that (1) the celadon bodies from the Dapu kiln contain less Al2O3, Mo, V, Cr and Ni, and more SiO2 content than those of the Longquan kiln; (2) the celadon glazes from both the Longquan and Dapu kilns show higher content of CaO, Al2O3, Ba, Sr, P2O5 and MnO than the corresponding bodies; and (3) both the celadon bodies and glazes from the Dapu kiln have higher ΣREE and in particular significantly negative Ce anomalies, distinctly different from those from Longquan kiln. These results would not only provide a good basis to identify the Longquan celadon and its imitation, and even to protract the global trade route in ancient time, but also be beneficial to better understanding the recovery and transmission of Longquan celadon manufacturing technology.","The imitation of Longquan celadon,LA-ICP-MS,Trace elements,Longquan celadon,"
"jurassic-recent stratigraphy, structure, and hydrocarbon potential of the mesozoic-cenozoic rifted-passive margin of the tarfaya-dakhla basin of southern morocco","2022","We describe the structure, stratigraphy, and hydrocarbon potential of the 1000-km-long Tarfaya-Dakhla Basin (TDB) along the Atlantic rifted-passive margin of Morocco. Our dataset consists of a 4885-line km grid of depth-converted industry seismic data tied to three DSDP wells in the deepwater area and exploratory wells on the slope and shelf. Based on mapping of this seismic grid, the tectonostratigraphic events that have affected this margin include: 1) a Late Triassic-Early Jurassic rift phase that separated the Moroccan margin from its conjugate margin in eastern Canada began during the Late Triassic-Early Jurassic; 2) early passive margin sedimentation consists of Middle Jurassic-Early Cretaceous passive margin phase consisting of a massive, 14-km-thick, reefal-carbonate platform formed above the rifted margin during the Early Jurassic and was subsequently buried by the 6-km-thick, Early Cretaceous (Berriasian) Boujdour deltaic complex. During this period continued high rates of clastic sedimentation resulted in margin steepening and gravitational collapse during the Valanginian and formed a 480-km-long and 68-km-wide passive margin fold belt characterized by a zone of updip normal faults of 480 km in length and 30 km in width and a zone of downdip folds and thrusts of 117 km in length and 15 km in width. Geochemical data from DSDP 397 and 369 wells and two pseudo-wells were used to evaluate source rock potential and hydrocarbon prospectivity of the Jurassic to Recent section. Basin modeling reveals that the Jurassic source rocks known from DSDP drilling are presently overmature in the study area with hydrocarbon generation beginning in the Upper Jurassic-Lower Cretaceous. The Lower Cretaceous source rocks are immature except for localized areas, and the Upper Cretaceous is immature across the study area.","Basin modeling,Shale detachment,Passive margin fold belt,Area-depth strain analysis,Offshore southern Morocco,Stratigraphy,Seismic interpretation,"
"a multi-sensor approach for the on-orbit validation of ocean color satellite data products","2006","The validation of satellite ocean color data products is a critical component in establishing their measurement uncertainties, assessing their scientific utility, and identifying conditions for which their reliability is suspect. Such efforts require a considerable amount of high quality in situ data, preferably consistently processed and spanning the satellite mission lifetime. This paper outlines the NASA Ocean Biology Processing Group's (OBPG) method for validating satellite data products using in situ measurements as ground truth. Currently, the OBPG uses the described method for validating several historical and operational ocean color missions. By way of a case study, results for the Sea-Viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor (SeaWiFS) are shown. These results indicate that for the majority of the global ocean, SeaWiFS data approach the target uncertainties of ±5% for clear water radiances as defined prior to launch. Our results add confidence in the use of these data for global climate studies, where a consistent, high quality data set covering a multi-year time span is essential.","Remote sensing,Chlorophyll,Water-leaving radiance,Ocean color,Satellite validation,SeaWiFS,"
"on the effectiveness of ai-assisted anomaly detection methods in maritime navigation","2020","The automatic identification system (AIS) has become an essential tool for maritime security. Nevertheless, how to effectively use the static and dynamic voyage information of the AIS data in maritime traffic situation awareness is still a challenge. This paper presents a comparative study of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques on their effectiveness in dealing with various anomalies in maritime domain using the AIS data. The AIS on-off switching (OOS) anomaly is critical in maritime security, since AIS technology is susceptible to manipulation and it can be switched on and off to hide illegal activities. Thus, we try to detect and distinguish between intentional and non-intentional AIS OOS anomalies through our AI -assisted anomaly detection framework. We use AIS data, in particular positional and navigational status of vessels, to study the effectiveness of seven AI techniques, such as artificial neural network, support vector machine, logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, decision tree, random forest and naive Bayes, in detecting the AIS OOS anomalies. Our experimental results show that ANN and SVM are the most suitable techniques in detecting the AIS OOS anomalies with 99.9% accuracy. Interestingly, the ANN model outperforms others when trained with a balanced (i.e., same order of samples per class) dataset, and SVM, on the other hand, is suitable when training dataset is unbalanced.","maritime traffic situation awareness,AI-assisted anomaly detection,decision trees,Support vector machines,logistic regression,Anomaly detection,static voyage information,random forests,ANN,marine navigation,Feature extraction,security of data,maritime security,k-nearest neighbors,regression analysis,AIS technology,naive Bayes,neural nets,naive Bayes methods,automatic identification system,marine safety,marine engineering,support vector machines,maritime navigation,dynamic voyage information,maritime domain,random forest,SVM,Artificial intelligence,AIS on-off switching anomaly,nearest neighbour methods,artificial neural network,Training,Trajectory,support vector machine,nonintentional AIS OOS anomalies,Navigation,artificial intelligence,decision tree,AIS data,"
"sea surface temperature variability in the north western mediterranean sea (gulf of lion) during the common era","2016","This study investigates the multidecadal-scale variability of sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the convection region of the Gulf of Lion (NW Mediterranean Sea) over the full past 2000 yr (Common Era) using alkenone biomarkers. Our data show colder SSTs by 1.7 °C over most of the first millennium (200–800 AD) and by 1.3 °C during the Little Ice Age (LIA; 1400–1850 AD) than the 20th century mean (17.9 °C). Although on average warmer, those of the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) (1000–1200 AD) were lower by 1 °C. We found a mean SST warming of 2 °C/100 yr over the last century in close agreement with the 0.22 and 0.26 °C/decade values calculated for the western Mediterranean Sea from in situ and satellite data, respectively. Our results also reveal strongly fluctuating SSTs characterized by cold extremes followed by abrupt warming during the LIA. We suggest that the coldest decades of the LIA were likely caused by prevailing negative EA states and associated anticyclone blocking over the North Atlantic resulting in cold continental northeasterly winds to blow over Western Europe and the Mediterranean region.","Mediterranean Sea,alkenones,Common Era,atmospheric blocking,sea surface temperature,East Atlantic mode,"
"emerging marine pollution from container ship accidents: risk characteristics, response strategies, and regulation advancements","2022","Container ship accidents can contaminate the surrounding marine environment and even have wider impact. Our study aims to provide a comprehensive review of emerging marine pollution from container ship accidents with the focus on risk characteristics, response strategies, and regulation advancements. It was found that the number of container ship accidents significantly increased in the past decade, and most accidents occurred in ports, harbors, piers, anchorages, berths, and open seas. The types of accidents were mainly collisions, groundings, and fires. The risk of marine pollution from container ship accidents is complex due to the variety of containerized cargo. The contamination derived from heavy metal, plastic fiber, leaked fuel, and hazardous and noxious substances after accidents can endanger entire marine habitats and be continuously accumulated through the food chain, eventually posing a threat to human health. The risks and pollution caused by container boxes are often overlooked. There is a basic response process, comprising data collection, decision-making, emergency response, monitoring, etc., for container ship accidents. There are currently deficiencies in management regulations for mitigating sunken container pollution. Improving operating procedures, establishing regional cooperation frameworks, developing contingency plans and protocols, and increasing public awareness can help deal with these pollution issues.","Regulation,Container ship accidents,Environmental risk,Marine pollution,Response,"
"rare earth elements and yttrium as tracers of waste/rock-groundwater interactions","2022","Increasing concentrations of Rare Earth Elements (REE) plus yttrium (REY) are entering the environment due to human activities. The similar chemical behaviour across the whole REY, i.e. the lanthanide series (lanthanum to lutetium) and yttrium, allows their use as tracers, fingerprinting rock-forming processes and fluid-rock interactions in earth science systems. However, their use in fingerprinting waste and particularly low-level radioactive waste has not received much attention, despite the direct use of REE in the nuclear industry and the traditional use of REE as proxies to understand the environmental mobility of the actinide series (actinium to lawrencium). The highly instrumented low-level radioactive waste site at Little Forest (Australia) allows a detailed REY study, investigating interactions with local strata, neighbouring waste forms and shallow groundwater flows. Groundwater samples and solids from cored materials were recovered from 2007 to 2012 from the study site and regional baseline sites in the same geological materials. The REY in water samples were analysed by automated chelation pre-concentration (SeaFast, ESI) followed by ICP-MS determination, while solid samples were analysed using Neutron Activation Analysis (NAA) and X-ray fluorescence scanning (ITRAX). Solid rocks showed no REY departed from typical Upper Crust compositions in either Little Forest or regional background sites. Shallow groundwater from ~4–5 m, at or slightly below waste trench levels, showed water-waste interaction as a marked enrichment, relative to shale-normalised patterns, in samarium, europium and gadolinium, with depleted yttrium. Leachate samples from the neighbouring urban landfill show different REY normalised patterns. REY distribution changes with depth through increased interaction with shales and sandstones. Variations in pH and redox conditions lead to widespread precipitation of Fe-hydroxides, which scavenge REY with differential uptake by precipitating solids, resulting in increases in Y and higher Y/Ho ratio in the groundwater along the flow path. Our study revealed that the Little Forest low-level radioactive waste has a REY fingerprint different to that of groundwater in surrounding land uses. REY can be used to fingerprint diverse waste sources, assess the mobility of lanthanides inferring the mobility of selected actinides, and to trace the fate of REY during groundwater recharge. The approach presented can refine source allocation and trace pollutant mobility in current and legacy urban, mixed and radioactive waste sites around the world.","Waste-rock interaction,Rare earth elements and yttrium (REY),Low-level nuclear waste,Landfill,Tritium,Little Forest Legacy Site,"
"phytoplankton community changes in a coastal upwelling system during the last century","2023","Phytoplankton communities in coastal upwelling systems are influenced by the interplay between human-induced and natural climate forcing that vary regionally and the two factors have not been well quantified. Combining lipid biomarker analyses in 23 sediment cores from the Zhejiang coast of the East China Sea and a physical-ecological model, we found that during the 1960s–2000s there was a 42 ± 4% increase in diatom proportions and a 17 ± 8% decrease in dinoflagellate proportions within the core upwelling area that is attributed to changes in Kuroshio Current transport and coastal upwelling. During the 1950s–2000s there was a 16 ± 8% increase in dinoflagellate proportions and 12 ± 4% decrease in diatom proportions outside the core upwelling area which is attributed to anthropogenic nutrient inputs and climate warming.

"measuring atmospheric composition change","2009","Scientific findings from the last decades have clearly highlighted the need for a more comprehensive approach to atmospheric change processes. In fact, observation of atmospheric composition variables has been an important activity of atmospheric research that has developed instrumental tools (advanced analytical techniques) and platforms (instrumented passenger aircrafts, ground-based in situ and remote sensing stations, earth observation satellite instruments) providing essential information on the composition of the atmosphere. The variability of the atmospheric system and the extreme complexity of the atmospheric cycles for short-lived gaseous and aerosol species have led to the development of complex models to interpret observations, test our theoretical understanding of atmospheric chemistry and predict future atmospheric composition. The validation of numerical models requires accurate information concerning the variability of atmospheric composition for targeted species via comparison with observations and measurements. In this paper, we provide an overview of recent advances in instrumentation and methodologies for measuring atmospheric composition changes from space, aircraft and the surface as well as recent improvements in laboratory techniques that permitted scientific advance in the field of atmospheric chemistry. Emphasis is given to the most promising and innovative technologies that will become operational in the near future to improve knowledge of atmospheric composition. Our current observation capacity, however, is not satisfactory to understand and predict future atmospheric composition changes, in relation to predicted climate warming. Based on the limitation of the current European observing system, we address the major gaps in a second part of the paper to explain why further developments in current observation strategies are still needed to strengthen and optimise an observing system not only capable of responding to the requirements of atmospheric services but also to newly open scientific questions.","Observation,Climate,Instrumentation,Air quality,Atmosphere,"

For their autonomous operation, and remote control, these ships need to communicate with each other, with the vessel traffic system (VTS), with the port state control (PSC) and with the shore control centre (SCC). For a sustainable maritime industry, the biggest challenge will be the implementation of reliable and cost effective communication carrier to assure a continuous ships connectivity. Our contribution consists of quantifying and classifying the data to be transferred, the identification of ship mobility environment challenges, and the proposal of mobile WiMAX as a reliable, secure and cost effective maritime communication carrier.

"the impact of climate change on the storm surges of the mediterranean sea: coastal sea level responses to deep depression atmospheric systems","2023","This study aims to systematically assess the impacts of projected climate change on episodic events of sea level elevation in coastal areas of the Mediterranean, induced by severe weather conditions identified as deep depressions. We try to add new insight in the long-term, climatic timescale, identification of affected parts of the Mediterranean coastal zone correlated to low atmospheric pressure systems, indicative of the Mediterranean basin during the 21st century. To achieve this goal, an integrated quantitative assessment is proposed by combining projections from available and established, green-house gasses emission/concentration scenarios (based on Representative Concentration Pathways; RCP 4.5 and 8.5) with advanced numerical modelling and statistical post-processing for the definition of cyclonic weather impacts on characteristic coastal zone hotspots. To this end, climate projections and outputs from three Regional Climate Models (RCMs) of the Med-CORDEX initiative at the Mediterranean basin scale are used and extensively evaluated against re-analysis data. These atmospheric datasets feed a robust storm surge model (MeCSS) for the simulation of barotropic hydrodynamics (sea level elevation and currents) thoroughly validated against in situ sea level observations by tide-gauges. Our results corroborate a projected storminess attenuation for the end of the 21st century, yet local differentiations in storm surge maxima around the Mediterranean coastal zone are pinpointed. Moreover, a slight reduction of average storm-induced Mean Sea Level (MSL; component attributed solely to the meteorological residual of sea level elevation) is also apparent towards the end of the 21st century. Extreme storm surge magnitudes range between 0.35 and 0.50 m in the Mediterranean with higher values along parts of its northern coasts (Venice lagoon, Gulf of Lions, northern Adriatic and Aegean Seas, etc.) and the Gulf of Gabes in its southern part. Overall, the spatial distributions of surge maxima are estimated to remain similar to those of the past throughout the entire Mediterranean coastal zone. Differentiations between the two scenarios (RCP4.5-8.5) used are obvious, not so much related to the spatiotemporal distribution of storm surge maxima, which shows a very stable pattern, but more in terms of their magnitudes. Indicatively, a decrease of surge maxima from -30% to -2% can be observed towards the end of the 21st century, especially for RCP8.5-driven MeCSS simulations. This is a spatially averaged estimation, yet for some specific coastal sites in Croatia, Spain Italy, and France, such as Rovinj, Bakar, Toulon, Trieste, Ajaccio, Genova, Marseilles, Naples, Venice, Cagliari, Ancona, Ibixa, and Barcelona, the storm surge maxima might increase from 1% to 22% under different RCM/RCP combinations towards the end of the 21st century. Our analysis leads to the quantification of deep depression systems’ effect on the coastal sea level elevation due to storm surges towards 2100. The strongest correlations of deep depression events to high sea levels are observed in several parts along the northern Mediterranean coasts (Gulfs of Valencia and Lions, Ligurian and northern Adriatic Seas). They are followed by mid-latitude areas around Corsica, Sardinia, the mid-zonal Italian Peninsula and the Adriatic, and the northern Aegean Sea. The influence of deep depressions on storm surges is lower for Sicily, South Italy, Peloponnese, Crete, the southern Aegean archipelago, and Alboran Sea. The only exceptions in the generally unaffected southern Mediterranean littorals are the Gulfs of Gabes and Alexandretta. These apply to the 20th century; however, they seem to repeat for the 21st century estimations, with even more pronounced differentiations between the southern and the northern parts. A projected northward shift of the main deep depression centres over the Mediterranean towards the end of the 21st century, is likely the reason for the latter. The climate change signal (difference of Future–Reference Period) of the deep cyclones’ effect on the episodic increases of coastal sea level seems to have a very clear pattern of slight attenuation in certain regions, i.e., Sardinia, Corsica, the Ligurian and Adriatic Seas, and the entire Italian peninsula for all RCM-fed implementations towards the end of the 21st century. Conditionally, this is the case for the Gulf of Valencia, the north-western African coasts, the Alboran, Ionian, Aegean, and Libyan Sea coasts, under specific combinations of RCM/RCP forcings. On the other hand, a possible increase of the Mediterranean deep depressions’ influence on the coastal storm surges might be the case for the Gulf of Lions, the Ionian, Aegean and Levantine Sea basins, covering the north-central and north-eastern coasts of Africa. In general, a positive influence of deep depressions to storm surge maxima would probably refer to areas of mid-to-high storm surge maxima (e.g., Aegean, Ionian, Gulf of Lions or Valencia or Gabes, etc.), but not the highest throughout the basin (e.g., Venice lagoon, Ligurian, Adriatic, etc.). In the latter coastal regions, however, intense local wind forcing mechanisms (i.e., Scirocco) are bound to play an essential role in the formation of high storm surges. The produced results can be used in focused studies for integrated hydrologic/hydrodynamic modelling under projected climate change conditions in the 21st century.","Mediterranean Sea,Deep depression,Sea surface height,Coastal zone,Representative Concentration Pathway,Inverse barometer effect,Storm surge,Climate change,Med-CORDEX,"
"40 years of changes in sea surface temperature along the western iberian coast","2023","Climate change is causing mean sea surface temperatures (SST) to increase worldwide. However, this increase has not been temporally or spatially uniform, with variations observed depending both on the period considered and the geographic region. In this context, this paper aims to quantify relevant changes in SST along the Western Iberian Coast over the last four decades, through the calculation of trends and anomalies of long-term time series of in situ observations and satellite-derived data. Potential drivers of SST changes were considered using atmospheric and teleconnections time series. Changes in the seasonal cycle of SST were also evaluated. We show that SST has increased since 1982, with regional variations between 0.10 and 0.25 °C per decade, with an increase in air temperature appearing to drive the SST trends along the Iberian coast. In the near-shore area, no significant trends or changes in the seasonal cycle of SST were observed, which is likely due to a buffer effect caused by the seasonal upwelling that characterizes the region. Recent decades show a slowdown in the increase rate of SST along the Western Iberian Coast. An upwelling intensification could justify this observation, along with the effect of teleconnections on the regional climate, such as the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the Western Mediterranean Oscillation Index (WeMOI). Our results suggest that the WeMOI plays a more important role in coastal SST variability than the other teleconnections. The present study quantifies regional changes in SST and enhances knowledge of the role of ocean-atmosphere interactions in regulating climate and weather conditions. Moreover, it provides a relevant scientific context to the development of regional adaptative and mitigation actions in response to climate change.","Ocean-atmosphere interactions,Rising temperatures,Buffer effect,Trends,Seasonality variability,Climate change,Anomalies,"
"radiative effects of reduced aerosol emissions during the covid-19 pandemic and the future recovery","2021","The pandemic in 2020 caused an abrupt change in the emission of anthropogenic aerosols and their precursors. We estimate the associated change in the aerosol radiative forcing at the top of the atmosphere and the surface. To that end, we perform new simulations with the CMIP6 global climate model EC-Earth3. The simulations use the here newly created data for the anthropogenic aerosol optical properties and an associated effect on clouds from the simple plumes parameterization (MACv2-SP), based on revised SO2 and NH3 emission scenarios. Our results highlight the small impact of the pandemic on the global aerosol radiative forcing in 2020 compared to the CMIP6 scenario SSP2-4.5 of the order of +0.04Wm−2, which is small compared to the natural year-to-year variability in the radiation budget. Natural variability also limits the ability to detect a meaningful regional difference in the anthropogenic aerosol radiative effects. We identify the best chances to find a significant change in radiation at the surface during cloud-free conditions for regions that were strongly polluted in the past years. The post-pandemic recovery scenarios indicate a spread in the aerosol forcing of −0.68 to −0.38Wm−2 for 2050 relative to the pre-industrial, which translates to a difference of +0.05 to −0.25Wm−2 compared to the 2050 baseline from SSP2-4.5. This spread falls within the present-day uncertainty in aerosol radiative forcing and the CMIP6 spread in aerosol forcing at the end of the 21st century. We release the new MACv2-SP data for studies on the climate response to the pandemic and the recovery scenarios. Our 2050 forcing estimates suggest that sustained aerosol emission reductions during the post-pandemic recovery cause a stronger climate response than in 2020, i.e., there is a delayed influence of the pandemic on climate.","Radiative forcing,Scenarios,CovidMIP,COVID-19 pandemic,CMIP6,Anthropogenic aerosols,"

"baseline air mass selection at cape point, south africa: application of 222rn and other filter criteria to co2","2004","Concentrations of 222Rn (March 1999–August 2002) from a recently installed analyser at the station Cape Point (34°S, 18°E), South Africa, were analysed statistically. The combination of 222Rn with information on wind direction and carbon monoxide (CO) permitted a classification of air masses into continental, marine, and mixtures of both. The ability to select trace gas data representing purely maritime conditions is shown through application to carbon dioxide (CO2) data. 222Rn levels at Cape Point ranged from near zero to above 5000mBqm−3. Monthly percentiles show practically no seasonal dependence for values up to the 25th percentile (P25), corresponding to 222Rn <100mBqm−3, which is considered typical for marine air. In contrast, 222Rn percentiles exceeding P50 reveal an austral winter maximum, related to a higher incidence of continental air at that time of the year. The wind sector pattern for 222Rn concentrations largely coincides with that observed for CO, but covers a wider sector to the east, reflecting continental source areas. Air masses with 222Rn levels between 100 and 250mBqm−3 were found to be still affected by terrestrial sources. Our routinely used percentile-based statistical filter applied to CO2 accepted <75% of the data compared to the radon criterion for maritime air (222Rn <100mBqm−3), which only yielded 18%, but is more stringent in excluding terrestrial influences. CO2 data filtered by using a combination of various selection parameters agreed well with data obtained for 222Rn <100mBqm−3, confirming that this 222Rn threshold is a suitable criterion for purely maritime data. Nonetheless, for CO2 the statistical filter, which does not depend on other species and has better data coverage, still retains its applicability for routine trace gas filtering with respect to baseline concentrations.","CO,Rn (radon),Background concentration,Data filtering,Air mass classification,"
"augmented reality for maritime navigation assistance - egocentric depth perception in large distance outdoor environments","2021","Augmented reality (AR) provides enormous potential to improve navigation assistance interfaces by displaying information directly into the user's field of view. In maritime contexts, such AR interfaces could supplement conventional solutions that require users to interpret spatial positions visualized on two-dimensional maps. In order to design useful navigation assistance, it is crucial to understand how egocentric distances of displayed objects are perceived and how different design attributes influence depth estimation. While previous research mainly focused on depth perception in indoor environments and rather short distances, this paper presents an investigation of the perceived egocentric distance of virtual objects in distances up to 75 meters in an open outdoor environment. In a perceptual matching task experiment using the Microsoft HoloLens 2, participants had to move objects with different (i) shape, (ii) coloration, and (iii) relation to floor to various target distances.

"“ship-port-country” multi-dimensional research on the fine analysis of china's lng trade","2023","Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) is a clean and low-carbon energy source that plays an important role in combating global warming. As the world's largest greenhouse gas (GHG) emitter, China has taken coal-to-gas as an important measure to reduce GHG emissions, and has become the world's largest LNG importer. Studying the patterns and characteristics of China's LNG trade is of great significance for ensuring energy supply security, formulating and adjusting energy strategies. However, the refined analysis of China's LNG trade is still inadequate, mainly due to the lack of research on the details of ship trajectories and port attributes. Therefore, a “ship-port-country” multidimensional LNG trade analysis method is proposed to improve the timeliness, multi-dimensionality and fineness of China's LNG trade analysis. The multidimensional characteristics of China's LNG trade are analyzed by studying the big data of nearly 3.5 billion automatic identification system (AIS) records in 2017. The study has found that (1) The arrival frequency of China's LNG trading ships varies greatly with time. For example, the most frequent daily arrivals are between 04:00 and 05:00 in the morning, while the least frequent arrivals are between 15:00 and 17:00 in the afternoon. (2) The Chinese LNG trade network consisting of 79 ports has been formed, of which NANTONG Port is the most important port. (3) The LNG trade volume calculated in this study has shown a strong correlation with the national LNG trade statistics and can be used to analyze LNG trade with higher spatial and temporal resolution. According to the characteristics of LNG trade at the three levels of ship, port and country, China can optimize its LNG trade policy from the following aspects: (1) Dynamically allocate port resources according to the arrival frequency of LNG tankers to reduce port congestion and waste of resources. (2) Expand core LNG trading ports such as NANTONG Port, ZHOUSHAN Port, TANGSHAN (JINGTANG) Port, XIUYU Port, DALIAN Port and LUSHUN Port. (3) Actively realize the diversification of LNG trading partners to reduce the dependence of LNG import sources on one country or region, and ensure energy security. The “ship-port-country” multi-level LNG trade analysis method proposed in this study provides a new research perspective for the analysis of the LNG trade pattern. This study reveals the multidimensional characteristics of China's LNG trade, which can provide decision-making support for China to formulate reasonable LNG trade policies and energy security policies, and is conducive to the stable and sustainable development of global LNG trade.","Multidimensional analysis,Ship trajectory data,China's LNG trade,LNG trade,Fine-grained trade characteristics,"
"contextual multi-armed bandits for data caching in intermittently-connected lossy maritime networks","2023","Information centric networking (ICN) is a promising architecture for intermittently-connected lossy maritime networks. By decoupling content from location and storing popular content in caches ICNs enable content access even when content producers are disconnected from the network. However, network-resource constraints, node mobility, and low data rates remain as major challenges to achieve the potential benefits that increased data bring to maritime networks. In this work, we propose an ICN architecture that uses dedicated caches and off-path caching to deliver popular network content to consumers. Our architecture motivates a data-caching problem in which each cache must define effective and efficient caching policies, with effectiveness assessed based on the cache-hit ratio achieved by the cache and efficiency assessed based on the usage of the communications budget allocated for data caching purposes. This work develops an online caching algorithm that enables dedicated caches to sequentially decide what content to cache. The online caching decision making problem is formulated using the contextual multi-armed bandits framework.

"detecting anomalies from a multitarget tracking output","2014","Surveillance systems typically incorporate multitarget tracking algorithms for sequential estimation of kinematic states (e.g. positions, velocities) of moving objects in the surveillance domain of interest. This letter proposes an algorithm for online detection of anomalies in the motion and the count of objects, using the output of a multiobject tracking algorithm. The surveillance area is partitioned by a square grid and the kinematic states that fall inside each cell of the grid are modelled by a Poisson point process. During the unsupervised learning phase, the parameters of the Poisson point process are estimated for each cell. The testing phase is performed sequentially by threshold detection at a specified level of significance.

"fuel consumption prediction for a passenger ferry using machine learning and in-service data: a comparative study","2023","As the importance of eco-friendly transportation increases, providing an efficient approach for marine vessel operation is essential. Methods for status monitoring with consideration to the weather condition and forecasting with the use of in-service data from ships requires accurate and complete models for predicting the energy efficiency of a ship. The models need to effectively process all the operational data in real-time. This paper presents models that can predict fuel consumption using in-service data collected from a passenger ship. Statistical and domain-knowledge methods were used to select the proper input variables for the models. These methods prevent over-fitting, missing data, and multicollinearity while providing practical applicability. Prediction models that were investigated include multiple linear regression (MLR), decision tree approach (DT), an artificial neural network (ANN), and ensemble methods. The best predictive performance was from a model developed using the XGboost technique which is a boosting ensemble approach.

"object segmentation from a dynamic background using a pixelwise rigidity criterion and application to maritime target recognition","2014","This paper describes a novel approach for rigid object segmentation from a dynamic background using a pre-recorded video with a moving camera, and we apply it to the problem of vessel segmentation in a maritime video scene. The difficulty of modeling background appearance or/and dynamic, modeling object appearance, and compensating camera motion renders this task very challenging. Therefore, the proposed method only uses a geometric constraint regarding target motion rigidity in order to achieve object segmentation in a full video segment. Such an idea is not new in object segmentation literature, but the novelty in this paper resides in that the target rigidity assumption is implemented at the pixel level, but not at the object scale. This is firstly achieved by deriving a theoretical optic flow model in the neighborhood of each pixel under the 3D rigid motion assumption of object, which is later compared against the observed 2D optic flow model in the neighborhood of a pixel in order to derive a pixelwise rigidity criterion. The latter is further reenforced along individual (pixel) trajectories in a video segment. Finally, a mere thresholding operation allows to quickly extract target from background in a full video segment. Our experiments using real maritime video sequences captured with an airborne camera have shown that the method detects maritime targets accurately.","Optical imaging,rigid object segmentation,maritime target detection,dynamic background,motion compensation,Cameras,background appearance modeling,Solid modeling,object segmentation,2D optic flow model,maritime video sequences,pixel trajectories,vessel segmentation problem,prerecorded video,Integrated optics,marine engineering,Three-dimensional displays,object appearance modeling,maritime target recognition,object detection,geometric constraint,rigid object,Object segmentation,video signal processing,moving camera,maritime video scene,nonrigid dynamic background,Motion segmentation,optic flow,image sequences,pixelwise rigidity criterion,image sensors,computational geometry,image segmentation,airborne camera,object recognition,camera motion compensation,"

The latter are, further, fed into a Fast-RCNN for carrying out objectness detection and box regression. Finally, a mere box post-regression operation enables to extract maritime objects.

"outlier detection approach for discovering anomalous maritime profiles","2023","Maritime authorities play a key role in ensuring the safety and security of shipping lanes and ports. The port state control mechanism enables these authorities to physically verify suspect vessels (e.g., involved in smuggling or piracy events), but choosing the most relevant vessels to be inspected represents a challenging task. This decision can be enhanced by AI-powered systems that analyse large amounts of data, identify patterns and report all observed discrepancies. This paper presents a statistical analysis on the temporal durations of four types of naval statuses: sailing, docked in port, waiting at anchor and not transmitting AIS data. These durations were extracted from the historical activity of different classes of vessels that passed the Black Sea region (Romanian Exclusive Economic Zone) in 2022. Probability density functions were built for these vessels and all statuses' durations were fitted into known parametric distributions. Finally, the paper shows the results of multiple outlier detection algorithms that searched for anomalous data in a multivariate manner.","shipping lanes,probability density functions,Electric potential,Safety,unsupervised learning,naval statuses,public administration,Black Sea region,maritime authorities,outlier detection,Probability density function,temporal durations,port state control,statistical analysis,ships,port state control mechanism,marine safety,marine engineering,observed discrepancies,anomalous maritime profiles,AIS,Seaports,historical activity,Artificial intelligence,sea ports,maritime anomaly detection,Statistical analysis,anomalous data,smuggling,AIS data,Romanian exclusive economic zone,outlier detection approach,probability,AI-powered systems,Security,production engineering computing,data handling,suspect vessels,"
"glaciations and paleoclimate of mount erciyes, central turkey, since the last glacial maximum, inferred from 36cl cosmogenic dating and glacier modeling","2009","Forty-four boulders from moraines in two glacial valleys of Mount Erciyes (38.53°N, 35.45°E, 3917m), central Turkey, dated with cosmogenic chlorine-36 (36Cl), indicate four periods of glacial activity in the past 22ka (1ka=1000 calendar years). Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) glaciers were the most extensive, reaching 6km in length and descending to an altitude of 2150m above sea level. These glaciers started retreating 21.3±0.9ka (1σ) ago. They readvanced and retreated by 14.6±1.2ka ago (Lateglacial), and again by 9.3±0.5ka ago (Early Holocene). The latest advance took place 3.8±0.4ka ago (Late Holocene). Using glacier modeling together with paleoclimate proxy data from the region, we reconstructed the paleoclimate at these four discrete times. The results show that LGM climate was 8–11°C colder than today and moisture levels were somewhat similar to modern values, with a range between 20% more and 25% less than today. The analysis of Lateglacial advance suggests that the climate was colder by 4.5–6.4°C based on up to 1.5 times wetter conditions. The Early Holocene was 2.1–4.9°C colder and up to twice as wet as today, while the Late Holocene was 2.4–3°C colder and its precipitation amounts approached to similar conditions as today. Our paleoclimate reconstructions show a general trend of warming for the last 22ka, and an increase of moisture until Early Holocene, and a decrease after that time. The recent glacier terminates at 3450m on the northwest side of the mountain. It is a remnant from the last advance (possibly during the Little Ice Age). Repeated measurements of glacier length between 1902 and 2008 reveal a retreat rate of 4.2m per year, which corresponds to a warming rate of 0.9–1.2°C per century.",""
"temporal displacement of environmental crime: evidence from marine oil pollution","2017","We provide evidence for temporal displacement of illegal discharges of oil from shipping, a major source of ocean pollution, in response to a monitoring technology that features variation in the probability of conviction by time of day. During the nighttime, evidence collected by Coast Guard aircraft using radar becomes contestable in court because the nature of an identified spot cannot be verified visually by an observer on board of the aircraft. Seasonal variation in time of sunset is used to distinguish evasive behavior from daily routines on board. Using data from surveillance flights above the Dutch part of the North Sea during 1992–2011, we provide evidence for a sudden increase in illegal discharges after sunset across the year. Our results show that even a tiny chance of getting caught and a mild punishment can have a major impact on behavior.","Pollution,K42,Deterrence,K32,Environmental crime,"
"combining high temporal resolution whale distribution and vessel tracking data improves estimates of ship strike risk","2020","When assessing harmful human-wildlife interactions, researchers often attempt to calculate the risk that an interaction will occur. However, these analyses often quantify risk based on temporally static or spatially coarse measures of species distributions and human activity. As a result, risk estimates often do not reflect the dynamic nature of animal movement and anthropogenic uses of the environment. To illustrate the impacts of various temporal resolutions of data, we present a case study of blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus) ship strike risk in the U.S. Southern California Bight by combining predicted daily whale distributions with continuous vessel movement data. This represents the first effort to characterize blue whale ship strike risk by including the most recent high-resolution estimates of eastern Pacific blue whale distribution. We used these data to compare the ship strike risk models at varying temporal resolutions to address the effect of using coarser resolution input data. Our results show that it is critical to account for both dynamic patterns of human activity and species occurrences when assessing the risk of human-wildlife conflict. Analysis based on higher resolutions of potential interactions show greater variability in risk. Coarser resolution data mask variability in risk that may result from patchy conditions of blue whale habitat and/or variations in vessel traffic. We also demonstrate that coarser temporal resolutions lead to overestimations of risk. For highly mobile species subject to human-wildlife interactions such as blue whales, long-term environmental solutions depend on matching ecological data to human activity data at the most appropriate scale.","Marine megafauna,Ship strike,Human-wildlife conflict,Migratory species,Dynamic ocean management,Anthropogenic risk,"

"an adaptive ionosphere clutter suppression and target detection method for hfswr maritime surveillance","2023","High-frequency surface wave radar (HFSWR) as a maritime surveillance facility faces the tough challenges. One of them is that various unwanted echo components constantly destroy the detection performance of HFSWR, especially the dynamically changing ionosphere clutter. This article proposes an adaptive ionosphere clutter suppression and target detection algorithm (AICSTD) based on improved higher order singular value decomposition (HOSVD) and deep learning network. First, we analyze the multiple-dimensional characteristics of different types of ionosphere clutter echo data. Then, refer to the multichannel HFSWR echo data structure, we apply simplified HOSVD and orthogonal subspace projection to eliminate the unwanted echo component and, meanwhile, preserve the target echo. The key parameter of simplified HOSVD is determined by the mean structural similarity (MSSIM) index, which contributes to reduce the computation complexity of the proposed method. Finally, we improved the deep learning network to detect the targets in various behaviors after the clutter suppression. In order to address the issue of limited clutter data, transfer learning based on historical radar echo data is applied. A thorough experimental analysis on various real clutter data shows that the proposed method performs competitively. Our method shows a superior performance over many state-of-the-art clutter suppression methods, with a covered target detection accuracy of 92.4% under strong spread clutter background.","Ionosphere,structural similarity (SSIM) index,higher order singular value decomposition (HOSVD),ionosphere clutter suppression,Tensors,Clutter,Deep learning,Object detection,Doppler effect,target detection,high-frequency surface wave radar (HFSWR),Reflection,"

We analysed the population dynamics of the exotic C. fragile and native congeners and their relative abundance on intertidal shores in N-NW Spain. Our results did not support the existence of current competitive displacement by the exotic species. The presence of C. fragile was clearly seasonal, while the native C. tomentosum was more persistent throughout the year, due to a higher frequency of frond sprouting from perennial basal fragments. However, our results also indicated an increase in the proportion of C. fragile relative to native species towards inner areas of the Bay of Biscay, which was correlated with environmental gradients. The greater tolerance of C. fragile to environmental stress and its opportunistic abilities may favour establishment and spread of the species under a warming scenario.","Displacement,Recruitment,Cryptic invasion,Environmental conditions,Population dynamics,Climate change,Codium spp,"
"assessment of arctic snow stratigraphy and water equivalent using a portable frequency modulated continuous wave radar","2023","There is significant spatial variability in snow cover characteristics across the Arctic. Current physical or empirical approaches to simulate or measure snow state variables suffer from poor spatial and/or temporal resolutions. Our current understanding of the spatio-temporal variability in Arctic snow cover leads to uncertainties in existing snow property retrievals from space or in models, thus leading to a poor representation of the snow cover in various climate models and reanalysis products. In this paper, we developed a method to derive total snow depth from a ground-based radar as well as distinguishing the two main layers generally observed in Arctic snowpacks: Depth Hoar and Wind Slab. This algorithm was developed for a 24 GHz Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave radar. The novelty of our approach resides in the fact that no validation snow pits are required if previous data on snow conditions (snow depth and density) are known. The impact of the underlying ecotypes on the radar-derived snow stratigraphy was also investigated. The RMSE of the snow depth ranges from 3.5 to 25 cm, but mostly varies between 10 and 15 cm (< 25%).

All tasks performed by the maritime transport system require continuous monitoring of the vessel performance, and for this, different IoT devices are installed on the vessel board. The IoT devices collect data related to the physical parameters of the vessel and share it with the coast-side servers. As the shared data contains confidential information about the vessel, there is a need for secure data sharing techniques, allowing only the authenticated personals to access the data received from the maritime IoT devices.

"palaeomagnetism and magnetic anisotropy of carboniferous red beds from the maritime provinces of canada: evidence for shallow palaeomagnetic inclinations and implications for north american apparent polar wander","2010","A palaeomagnetic and magnetic anisotropy study was conducted on the lower-middle Carboniferous Maringouin and Shepody red bed formations of the Maritime Provinces of Canada to detect and correct inclination shallowing. Because of the shallow inclinations commonly observed in red beds and the strong dependence of North America's Palaeo-Mesozoic apparent polar wander (APW) on red beds, inclination shallowing may substantially affect large portions of North America's APW path. Hematite is the primary magnetic mineral carrier in these red beds, accompanied by secondary magnetite, maghemite, goethite and pigmentary hematite. Thermal and chemical demagnetization of the Shepody Fm. successfully isolated characteristic remanence directions of D= 177Â°, I= 20.4Â°, Î±95= 6.5Â°, N= 19 and D= 177.8Â°I= 17.7Â°, Î±95= 6.9Â°, N= 16, respectively. Thermal demagnetization of the Maringouin Fm. isolated a characteristic remanence direction of D= 178.7Â°, I= 24.9Â°, Î±95= 14.5Â°, N= 9.High field anisotropy of isothermal remanence followed by alternating field and thermal cleaning on leached samples was used to isolate the fabric of hematite. Individual particle anisotropy was measured directly from magnetic separates using a new technique. Hematite's magnetic fabric and particle anisotropy were used to apply an inclination correction. Our inclination corrections indicate up to 10Â° of inclination shallowing, corresponding to corrected palaeopole positions of 27.2Â°N, 118.3Â°E, A95= 6.2Â° and 27.4Â°N, 117.2Â°E, A95= 13.1Â° for the Shepody and Maringouin formations, respectively. This correction corresponds to a âˆ¼ 6Â° increase in colatitude for Carboniferous North America, which translates into approximately a 650 km change in North America's palaeogeographic position.

The constantly refined models, resulting from concurrent incremental learning, are used to evaluate the behavior patterns of vessels based on their present motion states. At the event level, learning provides the capability to detect (and alert) upon anomalous behavior. At a higher (inter-event) level, learning enables predictions, over pre-defined time horizons, to be made about future vessel location. Predictions can also be used to alert on anomalous behavior.

"influence of vegetation on the ground thermal regime in continental antarctica","2009","Antarctica provides natural models that are influenced exclusively by climate change and/or other natural processes because the anthropogenic effects are negligible. The key environmental components of these ecosystems consist of vegetation and the underlying permafrost. The surface energy balance and, consequently, the ground surface temperature (GST) and ground thermal regime (GTR) can be influenced by vegetation, as is well known in Arctic areas. The interactions between vegetation, GST, GTR and their potential ecological implications in Antarctica have only recently begun to develop. This paper aims to contribute towards closing the gap of knowledge of these interactions. It does so by considering different spatial (intra-site and inter-site variability) and temporal (seasonal versus annual) scales with reference to dry and wet Antarctic cryptogamic tundra. For this reason, two sites and seven plots (bare ground versus vegetated ground) were instrumented and monitored in Victoria Land (continental Antarctica) to measure the ground temperature at different depths during the summer, as well as during one complete year. Our results demonstrate for the first time for continental Antarctica that vegetation provides an insulating effect with a net cooling effect on the GST, varying with the vegetation type, structure, coverage and thickness. Independently of the GST, the soil thermal characteristics constitute the driving factor in determining the thickness of the active layer. We discuss potential future implications of changes in the vegetation, ground thermal regime and permafrost in a climate change scenario, with reference to the activation of feedbacks through changes in the energy balance, in the permafrost conditions and controls over ecosystem C storage and fluxes.","Vegetation,Active layer,Antarctica,Ground thermal regime,Climate change,"
"a spectral-based clustering for structural health monitoring of the sydney harbour bridge","2017","This paper presents the results of a large scale Structural Health Monitoring application on the Sydney Harbour Bridge in Australia. This bridge has many structural components, and our work focuses on a subset of 800 jack arches under the traffic lane 7. Our goal is to identify which of these jack arches (if any) respond differently to the traffic input, due to potential structural damages or instrumentation issues. We propose a novel non-model-based method to achieve this objective, using a spectrum-driven feature based on the Spectral Moments (SMs) from measured responses from the jack arches. SMs contain information from the entire frequency range, thus subtle differences between the normal signals and distorted ones could be identified. Our method then applies a modified k-means−− clustering algorithm to these features, followed by a selection mechanism on the clustering results to identify jack arches with abnormal responses. We performed an extensive evaluation of the proposed method using real data from the bridge. This evaluation included a control component, where the approach successfully detected jack arches with already known damage or issues. It also included a test component, which applied the method to a large set of nodes over a month of data to detect any potential anomaly. The detected anomalies turned out to have indeed system issues after further investigations.","Structural Health Monitoring,-means−−,Spectral Moment,Anomaly Detection,Power Spectral Density,Clustering,"

"spatio-temporal outlier detection algorithms based on computing behavioral outlierness factor","2019","A major task in spatio-temporal outlier detection is to identify objects that exhibit abnormal behavior either spatially, and/or temporally. There have only been a few algorithms proposed for detecting spatial and/or temporal outliers. One example is the Local Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (LDBSCAN). Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) is mainly for clustering; it just tells us whether an object belongs to a cluster or it is an outlier. A measure known as Local Outlier Factor (LOF) gives a quantitative measure of outlierness to each object, where a high LOF score means it is potentially an outlier. LDBSCAN algorithm, which combines the above notions, considers only the spatial context. Furthermore, the notion of a cluster is defeated (i.e. LDBSCAN may report clusters having less than the minimum required points in a cluster), and some of the outliers may not be detected because of the limitation of the existing conditions in the LDBSCAN algorithm. In this paper, we propose two algorithms, namely Spatio-Temporal Behavioral Density-based Clustering of Applications with Noise (ST-BDBCAN) and Approx-ST-BDBCAN. ST-BDBCAN algorithm adopts the proposed, new concept, called Spatio-Temporal Behavioral Outlier Factor (ST-BOF), which is a spatio-temporal extension to LOF. It also uses both spatial and temporal attributes simultaneously to define the context. By doing so, the relative importance of spatial continuity or temporal continuity appropriate to the application at hand can be established. The Approx-ST-BDBCAN algorithm achieves improved scalability, with minimal loss of detection accuracy by partitioning data points for parallel processing. Experimental results on synthetic, and buoy datasets suggest that our proposed algorithms are accurate and computationally efficient. Additionally, new Outlier Association with Hurricane Intensity Index (OAHII) measures are introduced for quantitative evaluation of the results from buoy dataset.","Spatio-temporal outliers,Hurricane,Algorithms,Efficiency,Cluster,Behavioral outlierness factor,"
"anomaly detection and tracking based on meanâ€“reverting processes with unknown parameters","2019","Piecewise mean-reverting stochastic processes have been recently proposed and validated as an effective model for long-term object prediction. In this paper, we exploit the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) dynamic model to represent an anomaly as any deviation of the long-run mean velocity from the nominal condition. This amounts to modeling the anomaly as an unknown switching control input that can affect the dynamics of the object. Under this model, the problem of joint anomaly detection and tracking can be addressed within the Bayesian random set framework by means of a hybrid Bernoulli filter (HBF) that sequentially estimates a Bernoulli random set (empty under nominal behavior) for the unknown long-run mean velocity, and a random vector for the kinematic state of the object. An additional challenge is represented by the fact that two extra parameters, i.e. the reversion rate and the noise covariance of the underlying OU process, need to be specified for Bayes-optimal prediction. We propose a multiple-model adaptive filter (MMA-HBF) for anomaly detection, tracking and simultaneous estimation of the OU unknown parameters. The effectiveness of these tools is demonstrated on a simulated maritime scenario.","random finite sets,Kinematics,Bernoulli random set,Anomaly detection,anomaly detection,Bayes methods,Mathematical model,Switches,mean-reverting Ornstein-Uhlenbeck stochastic process,Stochastic processes,Radio frequency,OU unknown parameters,sequential estimation,piecewise mean-reverting stochastic processes,target tracking,stochastic processes,unknown long-run mean velocity,hybrid Bernoulli filter,random processes,simulated maritime scenario,nominal condition,long-term object prediction,Bayes-optimal prediction,noise covariance,anomaly tracking,Ornstein-Uhlenbeck dynamic model,underlying OU process,multiple-model approach,multiple-model adaptive filter,adaptive filters,unknown switching control input,random vector,"
"sampling errors in satellite-derived infrared sea-surface temperatures. part i: global and regional modis fields","2016","Long time series of accurate Sea Surface Temperatures (SSTs) are needed to resolve subtle signals that may be indicative of a changing climate. Motivated by the stringent requirements on SST accuracy required for Climate Data Records (CDR) we quantify sampling errors in satellite SSTs. Infrared sensors, including the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), have sampling errors caused by incomplete coverage primarily due to clouds and inter-swath gaps (gaps between successive swaths/orbits). Unlike retrieval errors, the sampling errors are introduced when calculating mean values and in generating gap-free SST fields. We generate MODIS-sampled SST fields by superimposing MODIS cloud masks on top of the Multi-scale Ultrahigh Resolution (MUR) SST field for the same day. Based on the MODIS-sampled fields, we calculate sampling errors at different temporal and spatial resolutions to examine the impacts at different scales. Our results indicate that sampling errors are significant, more so in the high latitudes, especially the Arctic. The 30°N–30°S zonal band is found to have the smallest errors; a notable exception is the persistent negative errors found in the Tropical Instability Wave area, where the mesoscale ocean–atmosphere interaction leads to a more frequently satellite sampling above the cold sections of the wave area. The global mean sampling error is generally positive and increases approximately exponentially with missing data fraction at a fixed averaging interval, while error variability is mainly controlled by SST variability. Areas with persistent cloud cover have large sampling errors in temporally averaged SSTs. We conclude that the sampling error can be an important or even dominant component of the error budget of mean and gap-free SST fields. Climate data generation and interpretation of satellite-derived SST CDRs and their application must be conducted with due regard to the sampling error.","Sea Surface Temperature (SST),Climate Data Records (CDR),MODIS,Sampling errors,"
"conceptualization and demonstration of the incident controller's problem","2016","Coordinated response to an emergency is typically the responsibility of a single decision making party referred to as the Incident Controller, who must develop solutions before the nature of the incident and response requirements are fully known. In this study, we argue four concepts necessary to build a quintessential model of the Incident Controller's Problem, and demonstrate their implications with a set of numerical experiments. This problem is characterized by the on-going discovery of information, creating an inherently iterative decision making environment in which the Incident Controller updates solutions employing a mix of complementary and potentially perishable response options, to minimize some undesirable condition while seeking efficiency. Our findings support the utility of decision making habits observed in the field, and underscore the need for better recognition of the distinctive nature of decision making under these conditions.","Emergency and disaster response,Incident management,Lexicographic goal programming,"
"timing the volatility risk of beta anomaly: evidence from hedge fund strategies","2022","Hedge funds are known to engage in the betting-against-beta (BAB) strategy arising from beta-anomaly-related market mispricing. This paper examines if equity-oriented hedge funds time the volatility risk when executing the BAB strategy. We apply realised and downside volatility risk measures to assess the BAB strategy. We show that for top volatility risk timers, older funds tend to be better risk timers, while among the bottom volatility risk timers, younger and larger-sized funds stand out as stronger timers of BAB volatility. We observe that the Long/Short Equity funds show evidence as the strongest volatility risk timers of BAB strategy when the market condition turned bad. This is supported by their other effective timing strategies at the same time, including timing the market sentiment. Our findings provide important references for private investors when selecting hedge funds as risk management is crucial to the success/failure of any investments.","Betting against beta,Volatility risk timing ability,Hedge funds,"
"multiple episodes of fluid flow in the sw barents sea (loppa high) evidenced by gas flares, pockmarks and gas hydrate accumulation","2012","Gas and gas hydrates have gained considerable attention in the last 20yr due to their possible impact on global climate change from methane escalations. Our study area, the SW Barents Sea, is unique in its evolution due to the effect of glaciations which removed thick layers of sediment from the seabed. Unloading due to erosion and deglaciation resulted in opening of pre-existing faults and creation of new ones, facilitating fluid migration and eventually escape into the water from the subsurface. Expressions of hydrocarbon gas accumulation and fluid flow such as gas hydrates and pockmarks are widely distributed in the Barents Sea. Several gas flares, some of them 200m high in echograms, occur along a segment of the Ringvassøy Loppa Fault Complex, indicating open fractures and active fluid flow. Observation of gas flares along regional fault complexes outside pockmark regions indicates that present gas escape occurs along faults only. The pockmark formation and gas flares belong to different episodes of fluid flow. The pockmarks are absent outside soft sediment depocentres indicating that their existence is related to the presence of recording medium. The thin sediment cover in pockmarks and their penetration down into glaciomarine sediments indicate that they formed after deposition of these sediments and that fluid escape was active to the very recent past. Methane hydrate stability zone (MHSZ) modelling shows that after the last glacial maximum 18000–2000014Cyears ago, the MHSZ has thinned from 600m to zero in most parts of the SW Barents Sea. The fluid expulsion probably happened after retreat of the glaciers causing release of methane from dissociation of methane hydrates through fluid escape processes which lasted until recently. Bottom simulating reflectors (BSR) observed are probably due to structure II hydrates formed from gas containing higher order hydrocarbon components such as ethane, propane, etc. along with methane. The study area falls close to the new gigantic oil discoveries, Skrugard and Havis, and north of the Snøhvit hydrocarbon field.","pockmarks,gas hydrate,BSR,gas flares,Barents Sea,seismic,"
"variability of lightning activity in south/southeast asia during 1997–98 and 2002–03 el nino/la nina events","2012","Impacts of the 1997–98 and 2002–03 ENSOs on total number of flashes and number of flash days from the LIS (Lightning Imaging Sensor) on board the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission satellite and on the average flash rate from the combined OTD (Optical Transient Detector) / LIS data are studied in South/Southeast Asia (8° –30°N, 60°–120°E) for the period 1998–2005. Also examined is the difference between the geographical distributions of these parameters in the El Nino period in 1998 and in the corresponding normal period in 1999. During the 1997–98 ENSO event, the number of flashes and average flash rate increase by 12% and 36%, respectively, during the El Nino period and during the La Nina period decrease by 22% and 5%, respectively, as compared to the corresponding normal periods. Similarly, during the 2002–2003 ENSO event, the number of flashes and average flash rate increase by 28% and 5% during the El Nino period in 2002 as compared to the corresponding normal period. The contrast in lightning activity between the El Nino and La Nina periods is more pronounced in Southeast Asia than in South Asia because of the southeastward shift in the convection activity during the ENSO events. In both regions, however, monthly variations of both total number of flashes and average flash rate are almost parallel to that of surface temperature. Although, the inverse relationship between the Indian Summer Monsoon Rainfall (ISMR) and El Nino broke down in 1997–98, the relationship between the El Nino and lightning maintains its normal increasing trend, indicating that the lightning activity is more sensitive to the convective activity than to rainfall on seasonal time scale. The total number of flashes and aerosol loading increase in the break‐period regime as compared to the monsoonal regime. The number of flash days in both ENSO events is higher in the EL Nino phase and lower in the La Nina phase as compared to their normal values in the subsequent years. Enhancement of lightning activity is mostly concentrated over land areas. Our results show that although diurnal variations in lightning activity can be related to the variations in surface temperature, convective adjustment induced by the corresponding ENSO phase needs to be considered for explaining the lightning activity variations on these longer time scales.","ENSO impact,South/Southeast Asia,El Nino impact,Lightning activity,"
"a multi-proxy reconstruction of tropical cyclone variability during the past 800 years from robinson lake, nova scotia, canada","2018","This study presents a multi-proxy reconstruction of tropical cyclone (TC) activity for the past 800 years from Robinson Lake, located on the north Atlantic seaboard of Nova Scotia, Canada. Two sediment cores were extracted from Robinson Lake and were dated by 210Pb and 14C methods, and analyzed for organic matter content, sediment grain size, and a range of elements and elemental ratios determined by XRF core scanning. A distinct sand layer in the most recent sediments is attributed to Hurricane Juan, which struck the coast of Nova Scotia on September 29, 2003. Our study shows that peaks in grain size farther down-core are generally correlated with abrupt increases in Br and Br/Ti. XRF-derived Br measurements are an indicator of marine organic carbon (MOC), and the increases in Br likely reflect incursions of marine water and nutrients into the lake as a result of storm surges. The results show that the period from ~1475 to 1670 CE contains at least 3–4 storm beds, and are interpreted as the most active TC period within the last ~800 years for this region. Our results are consistent with recent research from Salt Pond, Massachusetts (Donnelly et al. 2015), which provides evidence for heightened TC activity during the same period as our study at Robinson Lake. Our study represents one of the highest latitude paleotempestological studies from the North Atlantic basin which will help the testing of hypotheses concerning long-term changes in North Atlantic TC activity under future climate change scenarios.","X-ray fluorescence,Grain size analysis,North Atlantic,Tropical cyclones,Paleotempestology,"
"deep learning-powered vessel trajectory prediction for improving smart traffic services in maritime internet of things","2022","The maritime Internet of Things (IoT) has recently emerged as a revolutionary communication paradigm where a large number of moving vessels are closely interconnected in intelligent maritime networks. However, the tremendous growth of vessel trajectories, collected from the combined satellite-terrestrial AIS (automatic identification system) base stations, could lead to unsatisfactory maritime safety and efficacy. To promote smart traffic services in maritime IoT, it is necessary to accurately and robustly predict the spatiotemporal vessel trajectories. It is beneficial for collision avoidance, maritime surveillance, and abnormal behavior detection, etc. Motivated by the strong learning capacity of deep neural networks, this work proposes an AIS data-driven trajectory prediction framework, whose main component is a long short term memory (LSTM) network. In particular, the vessel traffic conflict situation modeling, generated using the dynamic AIS data and social force concept, is embedded into the LSTM network to guarantee high-accuracy vessel trajectory prediction. In addition, a mixed loss function is reconstructed to make our prediction results more reliable and robust in different navigation environments. Several quantitative and qualitative experiments have been implemented on realistic AIS-based vessel trajectories. Our results have demonstrated that the proposed method could achieve satisfactory prediction performance in terms of accuracy and robustness.","surveillance,dynamic AIS data,LSTM network,Hidden Markov models,deep learning (artificial intelligence),Internet of Things,smart traffic service improvement,abnormal behavior detection,high-accuracy vessel trajectory prediction,intelligent maritime networks,Predictive models,deep learning-powered vessel trajectory prediction,maritime IoT,deep neural networks,Maritime Internt of Things,deep learning,moving vessels,ships,automatic identification system,marine safety,marine engineering,maritime surveillance,vessel traffic services,AIS data-driven trajectory prediction framework,vessel traffic conflict situation modeling,6G mobile communication,maritime Internet of Things,Artificial intelligence,spatiotemporal vessel trajectories,revolutionary communication paradigm,long-short-term memory network,Trajectory,trajectory prediction,Navigation,combined satellite-terrestrial AIS,marine vehicles,realistic AIS-based vessel trajectories,unsatisfactory maritime safety,satisfactory prediction performance,"
"a proactive system for maritime environment monitoring","2016","The ability to remotely detect and monitor oil spills is becoming increasingly important due to the high demand of oil-based products.

"the changing role of fire in conifer-dominated temperate rainforest through the last 14,000 years","2018","Climate, fire and vegetation dynamics are often tightly coupled through time. Here, we use a 14 kyr sedimentary charcoal and pollen record from Lake Osborne, Tasmania, Australia, to explore how this relationship changes under varying climatic regimes within a temperate rainforest ecosystem. Superposed epoch analysis reveals a significant relationship between fire and vegetation change throughout the Holocene at our site. Our data indicates an initial resilience of the rainforest system to fire under a stable cool and humid climate regime between ca. 12–6 ka. In contrast, fires that occurred after 6 ka, under an increasingly variable climate regime wrought by the onset of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), resulted in a series of changes within the local rainforest vegetation that culminated in the replacement of rainforest by fire-promoted Eucalypt forest. We suggest that an increasingly variable ENSO-influenced climate regime inhibited rainforest recovery from fire because of slower growth, reduced fecundity and increased fire frequency, thus contributing to the eventual collapse of the rainforest system.","Rainforest,Pollen,El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO),Superposed epoch analysis (SEA),Tasmania,Charcoal,"
"long-distance mobility in the north-western mediterranean during the neolithic transition using high resolution pottery sourcing","2019","The Neolithisation of the North-Western Mediterranean is still an open issue. New data has recently enriched the chronological and cultural archaeological framework, providing more precise absolute dates and revealing a new and more complex process of expansion of farming in Southern Europe. The Mediterranean route of colonization (6000–5600 BCE), is characterized by the so-called Impressed Wares (IW) or Impresso-Cardial Complex (ICC) which demonstrate huge internal diversity in material culture, notably in pottery style and technology. This polythetic imprint of the ICC is intimately linked to dynamics of raw material exploitation (such as obsidian) and interconnections within circulation and exchange networks of goods. Through a comparative and multi-analytical approach to pottery characterization of entire assemblages from two distant sites in the North-Western Mediterranean, each characterized by predominantly local pottery production, we demonstrate long-distance mobility of non-local pottery vessels from the Tyrrhenian regions towards the Languedoc (up to 1000 km) during the Neolithic transition. Our study allows us to highlight this unexpected milestone in the first Neolithic migration in the North-Western Mediterranean.","Impressa ware,Pottery analysis,Ceramic petrography,Early Neolithic,Geochemistry,Provenance study,"
"mercury evidence of intense submarine volcanism and hydrothermal activity during a mid-tournaisian anoxic event in the carnic alps","2022","The mid-Tournaisian Event, or Lower Alum Shale Event (LASE), is linked to severe facies changes including pelagic carbonates and widespread black siliceous shales and radiolarites in many parts of the world. For the first time, high-resolution inorganic geochemistry and framboidal pyrite analyses were applied to decipher depositional condition changes during the mid-Tournaisian event in the Carnic Alps. The predominance of tiny pyrite framboids, high Corg/P, U/Th, and V/Cr ratios, generally higher enrichments of redox-sensitive metals such as Mo, U, V, and depletion in Mn suggest anoxic/euxinic conditions at the sea bottom. Moreover, we found very large anomalous Hg spikes (with maximum values reaching 3650 ppb) for the first time in the mid-Tournaisian deep-water marine succession of the Carnic Alps. Our results suggest intense volcanism during the LASE, which triggered the mid-Tournaisian anoxic event. The most likely candidate for the observed Hg anomalous contents is submarine arc volcanism and hydrothermal activity connected with the collision of the peri-Gondwanan terranes Paleo-Adria and probably Armorican Terrane Assemblage (ATA) and/or Noric terrane during the first phase of the Variscan orogeny.","Anoxia,Organic-rich rocks,Mid-Tournaisian Event,The Lower Alum Shale Event,Mercury,Volcanism,"
"weather-aware object detection method for maritime surveillance systems","2023","The development of machine learning-based maritime object detection technology aims to assist ship operators in maritime surveillance. However, as maritime environments can be quite complex, developing object detection models that can handle these situations is a challenging research problem, particularly when dealing with adverse weather conditions like rain and haze. While prior research has attempted to remove weather noise and improve object detection models under various weather conditions, they are limited by computing resources and hard to adapt to the constantly changing weather conditions of maritime environments. Preventing performance degradation as weather conditions shift is a significant challenge in maritime surveillance systems. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a weather-aware object detection method, Weather-OD, that employs an on-board edge and on-shore cloud-based system for maritime surveillance. It employs specialized machine learning models for object detection, which can be dynamically selected based on the weather conditions to ensure highly accurate object detection with low latency at sea. Weather-OD continuously improves accuracy by periodically training the models with newly collected datasets during voyages, and efficiently manages the life cycle of multiple object detection models, taking into account the constraints of limited edge computing resources. In addition, Weather-OD uses synthetic image data with weather noise to supplement the training data under different weather conditions. We conducted an evaluation of our weather-aware object detection models using a maritime benchmark dataset, the Singapore Maritime Dataset. Our experimental results demonstrated the feasibility of our mechanism with weather classification and a significant improvement in the mean Average Precision (mAP) of maritime object detection in rainy and hazy conditions. Additionally, our approach enables the continuous improvement of object detection accuracy through model retraining with small datasets.","Edge cloud,Maritime surveillance,Weather-aware,Object detection,Adaptation,Model specialization,"

"maritime environment perception based on deep learning","2022","Environment perception is an essential aspect of automated maritime vehicles, especially in high-traffic areas. In recent years, deep-learning-based object detection using LiDAR has been well developed in the automotive sector but has not yet seen a similar level of sophisticated development in maritime applications. In these applications, LiDAR detection should be fused with other maritime navigation systems such as the automatic identification system (AIS) to expand the detection range. To address this, we propose a novel deep-learning-based concept for maritime environment perception by using LiDAR as a primary sensor and AIS as an assisting information source. This approach consists of three functional modules: object detection, multi-object tracking, and static environment mapping. For object detection, we apply a convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect floating objects represented as oriented bounding boxes. To train the CNN, we propose a method that generates simulated labeled datasets. The detected objects from CNN are tracked with Kalman Filter banks. The remaining LiDAR data points are treated as static environments and represented by polygons. We evaluated the approach by using simulative and real-world datasets. In the simulation, the average precision of the CNN object detector reaches 60.8%, with a data processing rate of 40 Hz in GPU. Our real-world evaluations show that this approach can track 83% of the vessels in a crowded harbor, with the overall intersection over union reaching 64%.

"solar and tropical ocean forcing of late-holocene climate change in coastal east asia","2017","In this study, paleoclimate signals were extracted from high-resolution sediment records very recently produced from the Mulyoungari swamp on Jeju Island, South Korea and examined to determine the main factors driving late Holocene climate change in East Asia. The high resolution of the Mulyoungari records allows the detection of multidecadal to centennial-scale climate change with various cycles. This enables comparisons with important paleoclimate proxies such as total solar irradiation (ΔTSI) and sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the western tropical Pacific (WTP). Spectral analyses of pollen and magnetic susceptibility (MS) data identify significant periodicities of 780, 470, 135–145, and 50–70years. The Mulyoungari swamp responded sensitively to global climate change during the Holocene, showing well known Holocene cycles in the results. Our tree pollen index of warmness (TPIW) shows important late Holocene cold events associated with low sunspot periods such as Oort, Wolf, Spörer, and Maunder Minimum. Comparisons among standard Z-scores of filtered TPIW, ΔTSI, and other paleoclimate records from central and northeastern China, off the coast of northern Japan, southern Philippines, and Peru all demonstrate significant relationships. This suggests that solar activity drove Holocene variations in both East Asian Monsoon (EAM) and El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO). In particular, the latter seems to have predominantly controlled the coastal climate of East Asia to the extent that the influence of precession was nearly muted during the late Holocene.","Western tropical Pacific,East Asian Monsoon,Late Holocene,Solar activity,Jeju Island,El Niño Southern-Oscillation,"
"temporal behavior of deep-seated gravitational slope deformations: a review","2016","Deep-seated gravitational slope deformations (DSGSDs) are slow moving, hillslope-scale mass movements featuring characteristic landforms such as double-crested ridges and upslope-facing scarps that occur in diverse landscapes throughout the world. Although these deformations have been studied since the 1960s, significant insights to the rates of DSGSDs have only been gained within the last two decades owing to progress in geochronology, remote sensing and instrumental monitoring. Absolute age and monitoring data indicate that DSGSD movements are observable over long-term (≥102years) and short-term (<102years) intervals. Apart from creep, an episodic deformation also plays a crucial role, especially in regions with earthquakes and heavy rainfall. Our review also supports the notion of DSGSDs as precursors of catastrophic rock slope failures, given that many of the world's largest rock avalanches have occurred in areas with diagnostic DSGSD features, indicating that sudden collapse was preceded by a prolonged stage of slope sagging. Detailed studies on DSGSDs have therefore the potential for better prediction of catastrophic rock slides and rock avalanches. Future research directions include constraining the lifespan of DSGSDs with absolute age dating and precise high-resolution monitoring of spatio-temporal displacement across DSGSD bodies. It is of great importance to include absolute time scales in the numerical models of DSGSDs. Furthermore, combining remote sensing techniques such as Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry with high-resolution LiDAR scanning and near-surface geophysics offers a promising toolkit for collecting very detailed and accurate data on the short-term deformation rates of DSGSDs.","Catastrophic slope failures,Dating,Deep-seated gravitational slope deformations,Deformation rates,Monitoring,"
"a data driven approach to assessing the reliability of using taxicab as probes for real-time route selections","2021","Taxi service is one of the most important modes for urban transportation. In recent years, many taxi companies have been routinely collecting data to track the movement of each taxi for improving security, coordination, and service performance. This paper is intended to use the GPS vehicle positioning data to assess the route choice behavior of taxi drivers and explore if the routes selected by taxi drivers can be incorporated into a traveler information system. It is often perceived that taxi drivers have the ability to select quality routes assuming that: (1) they tend to be more knowledgeable about alternative routes and time-dependent traffic conditions than general public, including some publicly available route guidance systems due to the nature of their profession; and (2) they are typically more motivated to incorporate their knowledge about traffic conditions into their route choice decisions. An experimental study is conducted to examine the validity of these two assumptions. We have developed a framework that can effectively process the data into information about routes selected by taxi drivers and their associated travel times. The performance of the routes selected by taxi drivers is compared with the performance of those recommended by e-maps. Our results indicate that the routes selected by taxi drivers are generally more efficient than the routes recommended by some major e-maps, suggesting that taxi drivers are more active in selecting routes to avoid congestion.","Data driven approach,route choice,travel time estimation,taxi service,"
"a method for ice-aware maritime route optimization","2014","We present a method for ice-aware maritime route optimization. Our aim is to increase the safety and efficiency of maritime transport under icy conditions. The proposed method is based on the Aâˆ— algorithm, developed by Hart et al.

"dem analyses and morphotectonic interpretation: the plio-quaternary evolution of the eastern ligurian alps, italy","2012","The Ligurian Alps (Italy) straddle a complex and ill-defined tectonic transition that accommodates Eurasia–Adria shortening driving concurrent growth of the western Alps and northern Apennines. We focus on the Plio-Quaternary landscape evolution of the eastern part of the Ligurian Alps with the goal of defining the active tectonics through an analysis of topography, drainage networks, and river long profiles. The Ligurian Alps have a steep, seaward-facing escarpment with topographic features reminiscent of the geomorphic markers preserved on both actively-uplifting coastlines and passive margins. For example, there are seaward-facing benches that are thought to be uplifted marine terraces common to active margins; but the drainage divide of the seaward escarpment shows clear evidence of recent northward migration into the Po foreland, a process consistent with escarpment retreat characteristic of passive or subsiding margins. This study explores the active tectonics consistent with these diverse landscape evolution pathways. Our analysis reveals that rock-type strongly throttles the development of topographic relief, drainage networks, and northward migration of the drainage divide. However, we also identify segments of the escarpment that indicate recent base level falls through an analysis of modeled channel steepness and comparison with mean hillslope gradient. The base level falls are consistent with numerous barbed tributaries that are best explained as recent stream captures. No significant correlation among the stream captures at the drainage divide, suspected marine terraces at the coast, Ligurian Sea bathymetry, and active seismicity indicates that the escarpment is the footwall of a segmented normal fault. This normal fault is embedded in a regionally subsiding margin where actively uplifting segments lead to a straightened, pinned drainage divide, whereas, relatively inactive segments permit divide migration into the footwall block. These results are broadly consistent with rock uplift increasing eastward toward Genova across the long-suspected Alps–Apennine Sestri–Voltaggio fault zone. They highlight the respective roles of legacy structures, rock-type, and localized rock uplift in constructing a landscape in an otherwise extending and subsiding crustal retrowedge of an active subduction plate boundary.","Tectonic geomorphology,DEM analysis,Ligurian Alps,River longitudinal profile,"
"battery hazards and safety: a scoping review for lead acid and silver-zinc batteries","2021","Batteries play a critical role in our lives. However, depending on their chemical compositions and contents, they may turn into serious threats for both humans and the environment. Misuses and high temperatures during the operations may result in cell cracks and release hazardous liquids and gasses. In order to prevent fire ignition, strict safety regulations in battery manufacturing, storage and recycling facilities should be followed. This scoping review presents important safety, health and environmental information for lead acid and silver-zinc batteries. Our focus is on the relative safety data sheets and research studies. All findings are explained in a simple and clear manner. The goal of this paper is to identify risks and recommend solutions appropriately designed for increasing battery fire awareness.","Battery fire,Environmental impact,Safety regulation,Technological fire,Health impact,Safety data sheet,"

"relations between climate change and mass movement: perspectives from the canadian cordillera and the european alps","2021","Earth's climate is warming and will continue to warm as the century progresses. High mountains and high latitudes are experiencing the greatest warming of all regions on Earth and also are some of the most sensitive areas to climate change, in part because ecosystems and natural processes in these areas are intimately linked to the cryosphere. Evidence is mounting that warming will further reduce permafrost and snow and ice cover in high mountains, which in turn will destabilize many slopes, alter sediment delivery to streams, and change subalpine and alpine ecosystems. This paper contributes to the continuing discussion of impacts of climate change on mountain environments by comparing and discussing processes and trends in the mountains of western Canada and the European Alps. We highlight the effects of physiography and climate on physical processes occurring in the two regions. Processes of interest include landslides and debris flows induced by glacier debuttressing, alpine permafrost thaw, changes in rainfall regime, formation and sudden drainage of glacier- and moraine-dammed lakes, ice avalanches, glacier surges, and large-scale sediment transfers due to rapid deglacierization. Our analysis points out the value of integrating observations and data from different areas of the world to better understand these processes and their impacts.","Cryosphere,Mass movement,European Alps,Canadian Cordillera,Climate change,"
"noise reduction and atmospheric correction for coastal applications of landsat thematic mapper imagery","1999","The Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) has three visible bands centered at 485 nm, 560 nm, and 660 nm which can be used for ocean applications. This article presents a method for deriving the bottom albedo from the TM in coastal waters. Our study of historical TM images shows degradation of the sensor through time. Pattern noise in the imagery in Bands 2 and 3 was analyzed and removed using a combination of Fourier filtering and edge-detection techniques. Noise was first examined over clear and deep nearby oceanic waters, and the filter algorithms developed there were applied to the entire image. To estimate water-leaving radiance from the satellite sensor, Rayleigh and aerosol path radiance were removed. Radiance due to aerosol scattering was calculated for offshore pixels assuming a marine aerosol type, and it was removed as a constant from the entire scene. The TM sensor calibration was validated by comparing water-leaving radiance values over the clear waters of the Florida current with known, normalized water-leaving radiance values. Corrections for water path radiance and water-column attenuation of bottom-reflected radiance were made for regions of known depth, allowing the bottom albedo and vegetative pixel fraction to be determined for shallow reef areas in the Florida Keys.",""
"hot moments and hotspots of cyanobacteria hyperblooms in the curonian lagoon (se baltic sea) revealed via remote sensing-based retrospective analysis","2021","A temporally and spatially detailed historical (1985–2018) analysis of cyanobacteria blooms was performed in the Curonian Lagoon (Lithuania, Russia), the largest coastal lagoon in the Baltic Sea. Satellite data allowed the mapping of cyanobacteria surface accumulations, so-called “scums”, and of chlorophyll-a concentration. The 34-year time series shows a tendency towards later occurrence (October–November) of the cyanobacteria scum presence, whereas the period of its onset (June–July) remains relatively constant. The periods when scums are present, “hot moments”, have been consistently increasing in duration since 2008. The differences in the starting, ending and annual duration of cyanobacteria blooms have been significantly altered by hydro-meteorological conditions (river discharge, water temperature, and wind conditions) and their year-round patterns. The most important environmental factors that determined the temporal changes of the scum presence and area were the standing stock of cyanobacteria and the ambient wind conditions. The “hotspots”, the areas where the blooms most likely occur, were distributed in the south-southwestern and central parts of the lagoon. The least affected areas were the northern part, which is connected to the coastal waters of the Baltic Sea, and the Nemunas River delta region. The longstanding, well-established spatial patterns of cyanobacteria blooms were linked to hydrodynamic features, namely water renewal time and current patterns, and to potential nutrient sources that included muddy sediments and the locations of colonies of piscivorous birds. Our findings confirmed that the annual and seasonal variations of cyanobacteria blooms and their regulation are a complex issue due to interactions between multiple factors over spatially and temporally broad scales. Despite great progress in the prevention and control of eutrophication and cyanobacteria blooms, the lagoon is still considered to be in a poor ecological status. This work provides a new and missing understanding on the spatial and temporal extent of cyanobacteria blooms and the factors that govern them. Such an understanding can help in planning management strategies, forecasting the magnitude and severity of blooms under changing nutrient loads and potential climate scenarios.","Curonian Lagoon,Remote sensing,Eutrophication,Cyanobacteria scum,Drivers of hyperblooms,"

"mining usage scenarios in business processes: outlier-aware discovery and run-time prediction","2011","A prominent goal of process mining is to build automatically a model explaining all the episodes recorded in the log of some transactional system. Whenever the process to be mined is complex and highly-flexible, however, equipping all the traces with just one model might lead to mixing different usage scenarios, thereby resulting in a spaghetti-like process description. This is, in fact, often circumvented by preliminarily applying clustering methods on the process log in order to identify all its hidden variants. In this paper, two relevant problems that arise in the context of applying such methods are addressed, which have received little attention so far: (i) making the clustering aware of outlier traces, and (ii) finding predictive models for clustering results. The first issue impacts on the effectiveness of clustering algorithms, which can indeed be led to confuse real process variants with exceptional behavior or malfunctions. The second issue instead concerns the opportunity of predicting the behavioral class of future process instances, by taking advantage of context-dependent “non-structural” data (e.g., activity executors, parameter values). The paper formalizes and analyzes these two issues and illustrates various mining algorithms to face them. All the algorithms have been implemented and integrated into a system prototype, which has been thoroughly validated over two real-life application scenarios.","Process mining,Decision trees,Clustering,Business processes,"
"galernas: a history of coastally trapped disturbances (2003−2020) with hidden frontogenesis in the bay of biscay","2023","Galerna is the term accepted for an abrupt westerly change that affects the north coast of Spain. The wind surge travels from the mid-north coast of Spain to France, generally reaching their maximum intensity at the Basque Coast, and cuts off a period of hot weather, clear skies, and calm conditions at sea. The galernas have a large history of shipwrecks and fishermen deaths. They have been characterized as coastally trapped disturbances (CTD) and their propagation, enhanced with the local formation of a micro-front, was documented to behave like a density current. Alternatively, synoptic fronts have also been reported to cause galernas, considered to be more intense than those generated by a local micro-front. In this article we have generated the first climatology (2003–2020) of these events based on an objective identification methodology. The developed Event Identification Software (EIS), based on both 10-min surface station data and hourly ERA5 reanalysis fields, together with a new Front Identification Scheme (FIS) have enabled a deeper study into the origin and development of these micro-fronts, and a more comprehensive exploration of the interaction of the oceanic fronts entering the Bay of Biscay. Our results show that the area receives an average of four to five relatively intense galernas (Vmax > 50 km h−1) per year. Their number shows a great interannual variability (from one to seven) and a marked seasonality: May and June concentrate the largest fraction (almost one episode each year) and practically no episodes in winter. They occur more frequently between noon and the late afternoon, where the most intense wind records concentrate. Very strong galernas (Vmax > 72 km h−1) have occurred in all 18 years, can happen in any month from February to November, and their monthly distribution does not show the mentioned seasonality. On the contrary, the highest rates of temperature decrease across the galerna front in the coastal stations (−∆T/0.5 h > 4 °C) do have a stronger seasonality, with May and June concentrating a relatively large number of cases with a more abrupt temperature drop. The FIS shows that most of the galernas (83.5%) have a local origin inside the Bay of Biscay, and only a few ones (16.5%) are caused by oceanic fronts initiated out of the region. The local frontogenesis is more frequently initiated by the relatively cold marine southwesterly pre-frontals preceding a parent oceanic front and blowing against the warm continentals inside the Bay of Biscay, after being ducted along the north and northwestern coast of Spain. This hidden local frontogenesis, first revealed by the FIS, seems to be enhanced by the observed lee troughing, which could have both a thermal and dynamic origin, acting simultaneously after the intense Foehn at the coastal strip, preceding the formation of the galerna front. The local front enhancement appears to be the reason for the apparent jump of the primary front, which may eventually weaken, and even disappear, as the galerna front sharpens. Even during the more occasional frontal galernas, directly caused by the westerlies or north-westerlies behind the oceanic front, their eastward propagation is more rapid over the coastal area. The front deforms in shape and may cause its characteristic unexpected/abrupt irruption. All the EIS detected galernas, even the frontal ones, are wind reversals caused by a coastally trapped marine boundary layer. The upper-level ridge over Europe, observed in all of them, seems to be a synoptic ingredient for their development, preventing the eastward propagation of Atlantic depressions and enhancing at the same time the temperature and pressure gradients between the marine and continental air masses.","Bay of Biscay,Galerna,Frontogenesis,Mesofront,Coastally trapped disturbances,"
"neighborhood rough residual networkâ€“based outlier detection method in iot-enabled maritime transportation systems","2023","Outlier detection can identify anomalies in large-scale data. To provide reliability and security for Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled maritime transportation systems (MTSs), in this paper we propose an outlier detection method based on the neighborhood rough residual network (NRRN). We calculate the neighborhood approximation accuracy and neighborhood conditional entropy to obtain the neighborhood combined entropy describing the discrimination ability of the condition attribute subset to the information system. We then delete the redundant attributes according to the attribute combination importance derived from the neighborhood combined entropy. The data after attribute reduction are used to train the convolutional neural network, and the residual network (ResNet50) is used to avoid the degradation of model performance caused by the increase in the number of network layers. The proposed method is compared with mainstream outlier detection algorithms on a fishing vessel operation dataset. Experiments show that the proposed method can greatly improve the accuracy of outlier detection while taking into account interpretability and computational efficiency, thereby ensuring the data integrity of IoT-enabled MTSs.","Outlier detection,Data models,residual network,neighborhood combined entropy,Transportation,Entropy,data integrity,Anomaly detection,Behavioral sciences,Marine vehicles,Residual neural networks,IoT-enabled maritime transportation systems,"
"signal strength sensitivity and its effects on routing in maritime wireless networks","2008","Unlike terrestrial networks, the received signal strength in maritime wireless networks are subjected to perturbations due to the sea movement. Surface motions at sea cause variations in antenna heights and orientations of the communicating node (e.g. ships and buoys), thus affecting the received signal strength. In order to minimize such undesirable effects, we carried out a detailed study of the relationship between sea waves and the received signal strength. The effect of antenna gain variations due to tilting of antenna masts were studied by modeling sea waves. The channel path-loss variations were studied using a two-ray path-loss model for the maritime environment. Our analysis showed that the sea wave movements affect both short and longer links. We proposed a simple scheme to avoid the use of unstable links and implemented it on the QualNet network simulator. We carried out IEEE 802.16-based mesh network simulations with sea terrain and path loss models.

"benchmarking of emulated wireless edge cloud connectivity for maritime environments","2022","Remote ship pilotage, smart fairway navigation, autonomous maritime transport and smart maritime logistics present new challenges to the maritime industry. One of the challenges is increasing dependency on reliable network connectivity that can range from low priority entertainment communications to high priority safety critical communications. Traffic prioritization is needed at the open sea, where ships typically resort to expensive satellite connectivity that incurs long latency and narrow bandwidth. Near the coastline, ships can switch to 5G-based communications with low latency and high bandwidth, and possibly even utilize low-latency edge computing capabilities. Our contribution in this paper is a cloud-based networking testbed that supports network traffic shaping to emulate satellite and 5G-based communications between an edge cloud located onboard a ship and another edge cloud located onboard another ship or at the shore under traffic loss scenarios. Potential use-cases for our work include emulation of peer-to-peer communications (i.e., ship-to-ship or ship-to-shore) and mesh networking.

"accelerated change in the glaciated environments of western canada revealed through trend analysis of optical satellite imagery","2022","The retreat of mountain glaciers affects mountain hazards and hydrology, and new methods are needed to rapidly map glacier retreat at planetary scales. We automatically map 14,329 glaciers (30,063 km2) in British Columbia and Alberta, Canada, from 1984 to 2020 using satellite image archives from the Landsat 4, 5, 7 and 8 missions and reveal an acceleration in area loss that commenced in 2011. Glacier fragmentation, disappearance, and proglacial lake development also accelerated, as did the retreat of glaciers to higher elevations. Our annually-resolved method relies on the existence of previously published and manually validated glacier inventories from the mid-1980s and mid-2000's. Our methods performed well for clean ice glaciers, had occasional errors when proglacial lakes were present, and consistently underestimated the area of debris-covered glaciers. Clean ice glacier area loss accelerated sevenfold between the early [1984–2010] and late [2011−2020] epochs. This acceleration yielded rates of area shrinkage of −49 ± 7 km2 a−1 [early] and − 340 ± 40 km2 a−1 [late] with accelerated losses (32-fold increase) for small glaciers on Vancouver Island over the last decade. Glacier fragmentation accelerated from 26 ± 5.6 fragments a−1 to 88 ± 39 fragments a−1. About 1141 glaciers fell below our 0.05 km2 detection limit and so disappeared from our database, representing a loss of 8%. Proglacial lake area growth accelerated from 9.2 ± 1.1 km2 a−1 to 49 ± 4.5 km2 a−1. We also observed an acceleration in the upwards migration of median glacier elevations for clean ice glaciers from 0.31 ± 0.08 m a−1 to 4.7 ± 0.7 m a−1. Our workflow demonstrates the advantages of annual resolution glacier inventories and contributes towards the implementation of planetary mapping of glaciers and glacier attributes at annual resolution.","Remote sensing,Western Canada,Glacier change,Google Earth Engine,"
"bayesian filtering for dynamic anomaly detection and tracking","2022","This article presents a Bayesian approach for sequential detection of anomalies in the motion of a target and joint tracking. The anomaly is modeled as a binary (on/off) switching unknown control input that goes into action (begins to exist, or â€œswitches onâ€) thereby modifying the object dynamics; and by ceasing its activity (becoming nonexistent, or â€œswitching offâ€) returns the dynamics to nominal. The developed Bayesian framework brings together random finite set (RFS) theory to represent the switching nature of the anomaly, and optimal joint input and state estimation to sequentially update a hybrid state that incorporates a random vector for the kinematic state and a Bernoulli RFS for the unknown control input. In addition, a closed-form solution, the Gaussian-mixture hybrid Bernoulli filter (GM-HBF), has been developed to provide a customized solution for dynamic anomaly detection in the maritime domain characterized by linear Gaussian target dynamics. Based on the Ornsteinâ€“Uhlenbeck dynamic model for vessels, where the evolution of the object velocity is governed by a piecewise mean-reverting stochastic process, the anomaly can be represented by a change in the long-run mean velocity (i.e., the unknown control input) from the nominal condition that forces the vessel to deviate from its standard route. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed GM-HBF in both simulated and real-world maritime surveillance applications and test its performance in the face of false measurements, detection uncertainty, and sensor data gaps.","developed Bayesian framework,surveillance,kinematic state,Mathematical models,Anomaly detection,Automatic identification system (AIS),Bayesian approach,random finite sets (RFSs),Bayesian filtering,Bayes methods,object dynamics,linear Gaussian target dynamics,Switches,Bernoulli filter,switching unknown control input,Radio frequency,target tracking,Aerodynamics,stochastic processes,filtering theory,radar,state estimation,detection uncertainty,Gaussian processes,Bernoulli RFS,Radar tracking,maritime anomaly detection,dynamic anomaly detection,joint input and state estimation (JISE),probability,Ornstein-Uhlenbeck dynamic model,GM-HBF,Gaussian-mixture hybrid Bernoulli filter,"
"assessing top- and subsoil organic carbon stocks of low-input high-diversity systems using soil and vegetation characteristics","2017","The soil organic carbon (SOC) stock is an important indicator in ecosystem service assessments. Even though a considerable fraction of the total stock is stored in the subsoil, current assessments often consider the topsoil only. Furthermore, mapping efforts are hampered by the limited spatial density of these topsoil measurements. The aim of this study was to assess the SOC stock in the upper 100cm of soil in 30,556ha of Low-Input High-Diversity systems, such as nature reserves, in Flanders (Belgium) and compare this estimate with the stock found in the topsoil (upper 15cm). To this end, we combined depth extrapolation of 139 measurements limited to the topsoil with four digital soil mapping techniques: multiple linear regression, boosted regression trees, artificial neural networks and least-squares support vector machines. Particular attention was given to vegetation characteristics as predictors. For both the stock in the upper 15cm and 100cm, a boosted regression trees approach was most informative as it resulted in the lowest cross-validation errors and provided insights in the relative importance of predictors. The predictors of the stock in the upper 100cm were soil type, groundwater level, clay fraction and community weighted mean (CWM) and variance (CWV) of plant height. These predictors, together with the CWM of specific leaf area, aboveground biomass production, CWV and CWM of rooting depth, terrain slope, CWM of mycorrhizal associations and species diversity also explained the topsoil stock. Our total stock estimates show that focusing on the topsoil (1.63Tg OC) only considers 36% of the stock in the upper 100cm (4.53Tg OC). Given the magnitude of subsoil OC and its dependency on typical ecosystem characteristics, it should not be neglected in regional ecosystem service assessments.","Depth extrapolation,Ecosystem services,Regional assessment,Digital soil mapping,"

"“mystify”: a proactive moving-target defense for a resilient sdn controller in software defined cps","2022","The recent devastating mission Cyber–Physical System (CPS) attacks, failures, and the desperate need to scale and to dynamically adapt to changes, revolutionized traditional CPS to what we name as Software Defined CPS (SD-CPS). SD-CPS embraces the concept of Software Defined (SD) everything where CPS infrastructure is more elastic, dynamically adaptable and online-programmable. However, in SD-CPS, the threat became more immanent, as the long-been physically-protected assets are now programmatically accessible to cyber attackers. In SD-CPSs, a network failure hinders the entire functionality of the system. In this paper, we present MystifY, a spatiotemporal runtime diversification for Moving-Target Defense (MTD) to secure the SD-CPS infrastructure. In this paper, we relied on Smart Grid networks as crucial SD-CPS application to evaluate our presented solution. MystifY’s MTD relies on a set of pillars to ensure the SDN controller resiliency against failures and attacks. The 1st pillar is a grid-aware algorithm that optimally allocates the most suitable controller–deployment​ location in large-scale grids. The 2nd pillar is a special diversifier that dynamically relocates the controller between heterogeneously configured hosts to avoid host-based attacks. The 3rd pillar is a temporal diversifier that dynamically detours controller–workload between multiple controllers to enhance their reliability and to detect and avoid controller intrusions.

With the extensive data set now available for the state, the linear relation of heat flow and heat production appears as a very useful generalization for the study of the heat flow field of a geological province. Our measurements indicate that the vertical distribution of radiogenic heat production is similar in plutonic and metasedimentary rocks. Our data are compatible with the linear relationship established earlier by F. Birch and his co-workers in 1968. Young granites are markedly enriched in radioactive elements and those which do not outcrop are revealed by anomalies in the general relation of heat flow versus radioactivity. Heat flow is high for plutons by low elsewhere. The mean heat flow through metasedimentary formations is 1.15 μcal/cm2 s (48 mW/m2), a value near the mean heat flow for old cratons. The lowest heat flow measured is 0.76 μcal/cm2 s (32 mW/m2) for a unit poor in radioactivity. The heat flow field grades smoothly into the low heat flow regions of the Canadian Shield. The New Hampshire region is in thermal equilibrium: its heat flow is in secular equilibrium with the heat generated by crustal sources and that supplied from the mantle. In this area, the thermal perturbations due to orogenic events decrease below the detection level in less than 200–275 Ma.

"eloran: resilient positioning, navigation, and timing infrastructure in maritime areas","2020","Global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and localization technology have become highly compact and effective. Although GNSS has been proven to be vulnerable to jamming when the signal strength is weak, most vehicles rely on it for navigation. Compared to GNSS, enhanced Loran (eLoran) is more resistant to jamming and is recommended as a realistic alternative to GNSS. Therefore, South Korea embarked on an eLoran testbed development project to provide resilient navigation information for maritime users. The primary goal of this project was to demonstrate that the system can provide a 20-m position accuracy to the maritime user within a 30-km coverage of a differential Loran station. In this paper, we describe the development of the eLoran testbed implementation and the performance of its preliminary experimental results. To confirm the feasibility of the eLoran testbed performance, we installed an eLoran transmitter and two differential Loran stations and subsequently conducted a zero-baseline performance test at the Pyeongtaek differential Loran station with a new eLoran signal. We also conducted a survey to collect conventional Loran signals along the western and southern coastlines of South Korea.

"ten years of monitoring air quality and ecological integrity using field-identifiable lichens at kejimkujik national park and national historic site in nova scotia, canada","2017","Arboreal lichens have a wide range of tolerance to habitat disturbance. As a result, they have been used globally as bioindicators of environmental change, particularly for monitoring atmospheric pollution. Here, we use lichens to monitor air quality and ecological integrity (EI) at Kejimkujik National Park and National Historic Site in Nova Scotia, Canada. We provide descriptions of two protocols and compare the results using data gathered in 2006, 2011, and 2016. To monitor air quality, we established 12 monitoring sites throughout the park and used a suite of lichens that are intolerant to air pollution to develop an index of air purity (IAP) that we compared every 5 years. Our protocol for monitoring EI of forest ecosystems was set up at these same 12 sites. We selected 50 regionally common field-identifiable lichen species and genera ranging in sensitivity from disturbance-tolerant to intolerant, and compare their presence in spatially constrained zones on a variety of tree species every 5 years. Our results suggest that air quality in Kejimkujik has increased slightly in the 10 years since monitoring was implemented, which is consistent with improvements in local air quality. Species richness also increased slightly, suggesting that EI has not declined. The maintenance of EI, through protection and restoration of natural resources, is a key priority in the management of national parks in Canada. Our protocols will provide early detection of changes to EI, enabling park managers to take responsive action. We are confident that our protocols can be replicated in other parts of the world with different suites of regionally common lichens.","Sustainable forest management,Index of air purity,Maritimes,Acadian forest,Bio-monitoring,"
"silicon impacts on soil microflora under ralstonia solanacearum inoculation","2020","Silicon (Si) can increase plant resistance against bacterial wilt caused by Ralstonia solanacearum and enhance plant immune response. However, whether Si alleviates soil-borne disease stress through altering soil microbial community component and diversity is not clear. In this study, effects of Si application under R. solanacearum inoculation with or without plant on soil bacterial and fungal communities were investigated through high-throughput pyrosequencing technique. The results showed that Si addition significantly reduced bacterial wilt incidence. However, Si did not reduce the amount of R. solanacearum in rhizosphere soil. Principal components analysis showed that soil microbial community composition was strongly influenced by Si addition. Total 63.7% bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and 43.8% fungal OTUs were regulated by Si addition regardless of the presence of tomato plants, indicating the independent effects of Si on soil microbial community. Si-added soil harbored a lower abundance of Fusarium, Pseudomonas, and Faecalibacterium. Our finding further demonstrated that exogenous Si could significantly influence soil microbial community component, and this may provide additional insight into the mechanism of Si-enhanced plant resistance against soil-borne pathogens.","bacterial wilt,silicon,soil microbial community,deep pyrosequencing,"
"the last millennium viewed from a fine-resolution freshwater diatom record from northwestern patagonia","2022","Little is known about the response of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems to changes in climatic and human influences during the last millennium in northwestern Patagonia (NWP, 40°-44°S). By virtue of their sensitivity and specificity, diatoms are ideal for examining past changes in aquatic ecosystems and deciphering the ranges of variability under natural and human-induced conditions. To date, however, very few fossils diatom studies have examined in detail the environmental evolution during the last millennium throughout Patagonia. Here we present a fine-resolution diatom record from a lake-sediment core collected from Lago Pichilaguna (41°S), a closed-basin and shallow lake with a small catchment area located in the lowlands of the Chilean Lake District in NWP. The record spans the last millennium with a median time resolution of ∼12 years between samples, and shows abundant small Aulacoseira spp. between ∼1000-900 and ∼600-300 cal yr BP, which alternate in dominance with small fragilarioids and small raphid diatoms between ∼900-600 and ∼300-200 cal yr BP. A rapid shift to planktonic diatoms started at ∼200 cal yr BP and led to their modern dominance. We interpret centennial-scale changes in temperature, precipitation, and lake turbulence, with warm/dry/stratified phases between ∼1000-900 and ∼600-300 cal yr BP related to weak westerly winds, and intervals of cold/wet and mixed water column conditions between ∼900-600 and ∼300-200 cal yr BP, favored by stronger winds. The transition from periphytic to planktonic diatoms that started at ∼200 cal yr BP suggests juxtaposition of the warmest/driest phase of the last millennium and the onset of large-scale disturbance by Chilean/European settlers in NWP. Our results reveal that human disturbance during historical time surpassed the natural ranges of variability and resilience of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems over the last millennium, generating abrupt changes in biodiversity, species composition, and community structure.","Lake sediment cores,Southern westerly winds,Periphyton,Planktonic diatoms,Northwestern Patagonia,Tychoplanktonic diatoms,"
"ship classification based on ship behavior clustering from ais data","2019","Since the introduction of the Automatic Identification System (AIS), AIS data has proven to be a valuable source of ship behavior analysis using data mining. It records ship position, speed and other behavior attributes at specific time intervals in all voyages at sea and in ports. However, the current studies in ship behavior analyze the behavior patterns either with a subjective choice of classification for behavior differences among the groups of ships or without any classification at all. In order to fill this gap, a new methodology for ship classification in ports based on behavior clustering is developed by analyzing AIS data from the port of Rotterdam. Besides a proper data preparation, the proposed methodology consists of two steps: step I, clustering ship behavior in a port area and identifying the characteristics of the clusters; step II, classifying ships to such behavior clusters based on the ship characteristics. The clustering results present both the behavior patterns and the behavior change patterns for ship path and speed over ground, which are the dominant behavior attributes for ships in ports. Some patterns of integral ship behavior can also be revealed by investigating the correlation between the two behavior attributes. Our research has shown that length and beam can be adopted as explanatory variable to classify ships to the corresponding behavior clusters. The classifiers are developed based on both unsupervised discretization (equal width binning) and supervised discretization (Chi2). The performances of classifiers are compared by three evaluation metrics, including Average Accuracy, F1score, and AUC. We found that the classification based on multi-criteria is more accurate than using a single criterion. The classifications based on Chi2 discretization outperform the ones with equal width discretization. The outcome leads to a systematic understanding of ship behavior in a port area and can be used to predict the ship behavior pattern based on their characteristics and simulate the ship behavior.","Ship classification,Ports and waterways,Behavior clustering,Data mining,AIS data,"
"an early holocene westerly minimum in the southern mid-latitudes","2021","An important coupled ocean-atmospheric system in the mid- and high latitudes involves the Southern Westerly Winds (SWW) and the Southern Ocean (SO), which controls climate in the southernmost third of the world, deep water formation, and ventilation of CO2 from the deep ocean. Most studies have examined its role as a driver of atmospheric CO2 concentrations during glacial terminations, but very few have investigated its influence during the Holocene, i.e. the current interglacial. A fundamental problem, however, is resolving whether the SWW strength increased or declined during the early Holocene (∼11.5–7.5 ka, ka = 1000 cal yr BP) in sectors adjacent to the Drake Passage. Here we assess past changes in SWW influence over the last ∼17,000 years using terrestrial paleoclimate records from southwestern Patagonia (∼52°S). We detect a zonally symmetric Early Holocene Westerly Minimum which diminished wind stress and upwelling on the SO, contributing to a contemporary decline in atmospheric CO2 concentrations and enrichment in the stable carbon isotope ratio of atmospheric CO2 (δ13Catm). Our mid-latitude data also indicate a shift to strong SWW influence at ∼7.5 ka which correlates with a sustained increase in atmospheric CO2 and halt in the δ13Catm rise, suggesting enhancement of high-latitude ocean ventilation by an invigorated SWW-SO coupled system.","Southern middle latitudes,Early holocene westerly minimum,Southern westerly winds,Southwestern patagonia,Atmospheric CO2 holocene,"
"spatial clustering method of historical ais data for maritime traffic routes extraction","2022","The automated extraction of maritime routes that accurately resembles the real traffic of vessels is crucial for intelligent traffic management systems to understand vessel behaviour in sea areas, identify events, and support decision-making. Available solutions for maritime traffic route extraction utilize traditional clustering algorithms, which have high computational costs. Data reduction methods are proposed for use with these clustering methods to improve clustering performance, which involves a loss in movement pattern quality. Such solutions often result in low quality representations of traffic routes, which poorly estimate sailing distances for long journeys and time of arrivals and poorly identify non-conformities. In this paper, we propose a spatial clustering method (SPTCLUST-II) to extract spatial representations of sailing routes from historical Automatic Identification System (AIS) data. Our method can cluster huge volumes of trajectory data in a minimal amount of time without using any of the traditional clustering algorithms and with no reduction or modification of the spatio-temporal predicates of the original trajectories. A real-world AIS dataset captured in the area of the Gulf of Mexico is used for the evaluation of the proposed method. The results demonstrate that the proposed method extracts tankers maritime traffic routes with an accuracy of 97% and a f1-measure of 98.5% and cargoes maritime traffic routes with an accuracy of 98.1% and a f1-measure of 99%.

"assimilating satellite-based snow depth and snow cover products for improving snow predictions in alaska","2013","Several satellite-based snow products are assimilated, both separately and jointly, into the Noah land surface model for improving snow prediction in Alaska. These include the standard and interpreted versions of snow cover fraction (SCF) data from the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the snow depth (SD) estimates from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for the Earth Observing System (AMSR-E). The satellite-based SD estimates are adjusted against in situ observations via statistical interpolation to reduce the potentially large biases, prior to being assimilated using an ensemble Kalman filter. A customized, rule-based direct insertion approach is developed to assimilate the two SCF datasets. Our results indicate that considerable overall improvement on snow prediction can be achieved via assimilating the bias-adjusted satellite SD estimates; however, the improvement does not always translate into improvements in streamflow prediction. Assimilating the standard MODIS SCF is found to have little impact on snow and streamflow predictions, while assimilating the interpreted SCF estimates, which have reduced cloud coverage and improved snow mapping accuracy, has resulted in the most consistent improvements on snow and streamflow predictions across the study domain.","Satellite snow products,Snow prediction,Data assimilation,Streamflow prediction,"
"context-enhanced vessel prediction based on ornstein-uhlenbeck processes using historical ais traffic patterns: real-world experimental results","2014","Traffic route analysis and prediction are both essential for maritime security. Specifically, the prediction of a vessel position is useful to provide alerts about upcoming events (e.g., opportunities and threats). However, accurate prediction along a route in the maritime domain is a challenging task, due to the complex and dynamic nature of traffic patterns. This paper presents a vessel prediction method, based on the popular Ornstein-Uhlenbeck stochastic processes, whose parameters are estimated from historical patterns of life. The historical traffic routes are obtained by pre-processing Automatic Identification System (AIS) data via the CMRE tool called Traffic Route Extraction for Anomaly Detection (TREAD). These recurrent routes allow prediction of the position of a vessel that is following one of these routes, surprisingly, by several hours. The method is validated using a case study related to the second data campaign of the EC FP7 Project New Service Capabilities for Integrated and Advanced Maritime Surveillance (NEREIDS)1.

"assessing the potentials of digitalization as a tool for climate change adaptation and sustainable development in urban centres","2020","Digitalization is a key enabler of sustainable development of cities’ socio-economic dynamics with the potential to foster climate-friendly urban environments and societies. The advent of the 4th industrial revolution has seen the increased application of digitalization in several fields and at different levels. High-tech digital devices, platforms and environments are increasingly being deployed to enhance productivity, efficiency and sustainability, and improve overall well-being of urban dwellers. Digitalization is projected to further impact cities in future, transform jobs and trigger life-style changes with far-reaching impacts that will ultimately affect cities’ resilience and adaptation capacities. While a growing body of research has highlighted the significance of digitalization to climate change mitigation such as reducing GHG and CO2 emissions, comprehensive evaluations of the potentials of digitalization as an enabler of climate change adaptation remain scarce. This paper addresses this gap by analysing the current trend in digital revolution in relation to climate change adaptation and examines the likely challenges of digitalization. A desk research method was adopted, focusing on core digitalization concepts driving the Fourth Industrial Revolution (IR 4.0). Nine case studies in cities across various continents were selected to assess the potentials of digitalization in addressing climatic hazards and to highlight benefits from implementing digitalization, while considering the social-ecological-technological challenges and tensions around IR 4.0. Our findings reveal the capabilities of digitalization in supporting more effective early warning and emergency response systems, enhancing food and water security, improving power infrastructure performance, enabling citizen engagement and participatory adaptation measures and minimizing the impacts of climatic hazards. Finally, we recommend feasible pathways to overcome present risks and challenges in order to optimize the numerous opportunities offered by digitalization in support of climate change adaptation initiatives.","Digitalization,Urban,Adaptation,Sustainable,Climate change,"
"southern annular mode impacts on global ocean surface waves","2018","We assess the impact of the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) on global ocean wind waves using 30 years of wave data from a wave model hindcast that is forced with high resolution surface winds from the NCEP-CFSR reanalysis. Our primary focus is on the wave field and swell influence in the Southern Hemisphere, and we apply our analysis to each of the four temperate-zone seasons comprising March–May (MAM), June–August (JJA), September-November (SON), and December–February (DJF). Statistically significant anomalies in significant wave height (Hs), peak wave period (Tp) and zonal wave energy flux (CgE) are found to covary with local variations in surface zonal wind induced by the low and high polarity phases of the SAM. The signature of the SAM in ocean surface waves extends beyond local wind-generated forcing in the Southern Hemisphere extratropics to remote forcing in the Northern Hemisphere extratropics during DJF, with the associated atmospheric signal resembling a tropically-forced Rossby wave train. This has a significant impact on surface waves in the central North Pacific and North Atlantic oceans. The El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) acts to weaken the link between the SAM and Northern Hemisphere winter climate, with the zonal wind / divergence anomalies amplifying over the tropical Pacific Ocean when we exclude El Niño and La Niña years from the analysis. This remote link to the SAM thus occurs independent of ENSO via SAM-driven changes to the tropical atmospheric circulation, suggesting that the SAM may provide a useful predictive signal for the Northern Hemisphere during DJF. The SAM also influences the occurrence of daily low (below the 5th percentile) and high (above the 95th percentile) wave conditions, emphasizing that the SAM may be a valuable source of predictable wave variability from sub-weekly to seasonal timescales. Future work should explore wave data suitable for trend analysis, considering the positive trend in the SAM over recent decades.",""

"malicious ais spoofing and abnormal stealth deviations: a comprehensive statistical framework for maritime anomaly detection","2021","The automatic identification system (AIS) is an essential and economical equipment for collision avoidance and maritime surveillance. However, AIS can be subject to intentional reporting of false information, or â€œspoofingâ€. This article assumes the vessel trajectory nominally follows a piecewise mean-reverting process; thereby, it addresses the problem of establishing whether a vessel is reporting adulterated position information through AIS messages in order to hide its current planned route and a possible deviation from the nominal route. Multiple hypothesis testing suggests a framework to enlist reliable information from monitoring systems (coastal radars and space-born satellite sensors) in support of detection of anomalies, spoofing, and stealth deviations. The proposed solution involves the derivation of anomaly detection rules based on the generalized likelihood ratio test and the model-order selection methodologies.

"maritime situation analysis: a multi-vessel interaction and anomaly detection framework","2014","Maritime security is critical for protecting sea lanes, ports, harborsand other critical infrastructure against a broad range of threats and illegal activities like smuggling, human trafficking, piracy and terrorism.

In this paper, we propose a novel situation analysis approach to analyze, detect and differentiate a range of interaction patterns and anomalies of interest for marine vessels that operate over some period of time in relative proximity to each other. We analyze vessel interaction scenarios to model common patterns as probabilistic processes in terms of hidden Markov models.

"local glaciers record delayed peak holocene warmth in south greenland","2020","Local glaciers and ice caps (GICs) respond sensitively and quickly, on the scale of decades to centuries, to climate variations. Continuous records of past fluctuations in GIC size provide information on the timing and magnitude of Holocene climate shifts, and a longer-term perspective on 21st century glacier retreat. Although there is broad-scale agreement on millennial-scale trends in Holocene climate variability and fluctuations in local GICs in Greenland, regional variations are only loosely constrained. Here we present three Holocene proglacial lake sediment records from South Greenland, an area with abundant local glaciers but few Holocene-length paleoclimate records. In addition, we use geospatial analysis to model past equilibrium-line altitudes (ELAs) and thereby constrain the magnitude of ablation-season temperature change during the warmest and coolest periods of the Holocene. Physical and geochemical sedimentary characteristics show that two of the proglacial lakes continued to receive glacial meltwater input until ∼7.3 and ∼7.1 ka BP. The survival of local glaciers implies that South Greenland remained relatively cool, and that summer temperatures gradually warmed, but did not warm well beyond 1.2 °C above present in the early Holocene. In the mid-Holocene, from ∼7.1 to 5.5 ka BP, organic sedimentation at these two sites indicates that local glaciers became very small, or more likely melted away completely. The glaciers within the third lake’s catchment melted away prior to ∼5.2 ka BP, as sediments deposited earlier in the Holocene could not be dated at this site. We estimate that summer temperatures increased by at least 1.2–1.8 °C above present by ∼7.3–7.1 ka BP. Our results are consistent with other observations that suggest a north-to-south gradient in the timing of Holocene thermal maximum conditions, with southern Greenland experiencing a delayed warming relative to other regions in Greenland. As summer temperatures cooled in the Neoglacial, our records show that sustained glacier regrowth began ∼3.1 ka BP with glaciers in the southernmost catchment, which at present, receive the most precipitation. In the other two catchments, which host smaller glaciers in a drier environment, regrowth began at ∼1.3 and ∼1.2 ka BP, the timing of which is in agreement with other glacial records from the Arctic Atlantic region. Local glaciers reached their maximum late Holocene extents during a cooler, second phase of the Little Ice Age (LIA) ∼0.2-0.1 ka BP, that we estimate was at least 0.4–0.9 °C cooler than present. Overall, these findings improve understanding of the spatio-temporal dynamics of Holocene glacier and climate change in Greenland, potentially yielding valuable information about their future response.","Holocene thermal maximum,Mountain glaciers,Lake sediments,Equilibrium-line altitudes,Greenland,Paleotemperatures,Little ice age,"
"a hybrid entropy-based dos attacks detection system for software defined networks (sdn): a proposed trust mechanism","2021","Software defined networks are an emerging category of networks in which the data plane and control plane are separated. This separation of planes opens the door for designing sophisticated routing algorithms that would overwhelm the computing power of traditional networking nodes. In this paper, we consider the possibility of introducing node trust into the routing problem. There are many ways for measuring node trust. However, in this paper, we focus on denial of service attacks. We develop a hybrid method for detecting denial of service attacks and incorporate this information in routing decisions so that nodes that are part of a botnet can be quickly identified and excluded from the network. The proposed method is flexible enough to allow nodes that have been suspected of participating in a denial of service attack to be “rehabilitated” if they cease their malicious behavior. The technique is also able to detect the start of a second attack while another one is on-going. Our results indicate that the proposed method for detecting denial of service attacks performs better than non-hybrid techniques.","Entropy,Denial of service attacks,Stochastic distance metrics,Software defined networks,"
"multispectral imaging contributions to global land ice measurements from space","2005","Global Land Ice Measurements from Space (GLIMS) is an international consortium established to acquire satellite images of the world's glaciers, analyse them for glacier extent and changes, and assess change data for causes and implications for people and the environment. Although GLIMS is making use of multiple remote-sensing systems, ASTER (Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and reflection Radiometer) is optimized for many needed observations, including mapping of glacier boundaries and material facies, and tracking of surface dynamics, such as flow vector fields and supraglacial lake development. Software development by GLIMS is geared toward mapping clean-ice and debris-covered glaciers; terrain classification emphasizing snow, ice, water, and admixtures of ice with rock debris; multitemporal change analysis; visualization of images and derived data; and interpretation and archiving of derived data. A global glacier database has been designed at the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC, Boulder, Colorado); parameters are compatible with and expanded from those of the World Glacier Inventory (WGI). These technology efforts are summarized here, but will be presented in detail elsewhere. Our presentation here pertains to one broad question: How can ASTER and other satellite multispectral data be used to map, monitor, and characterize the state and dynamics of glaciers and to understand their responses to 20th and 21st century climate change? Our sampled results are not yet glaciologically or climatically representative. Our early results, while indicating complexity, are generally consistent with the glaciology community's conclusion that climate change is spurring glacier responses around the world (mainly retreat). Whether individual glaciers are advancing or retreating, the aggregate average of glacier change must be climatic in origin, as nonclimatic variations average out. We have discerned regional spatial patterns in glaciological response behavior; these patterns are best attributed to climate-change variability and to regional differences in glacier size and response times. In many cases, glacier length changes under-represent the magnitude of glacier ablation, because thinning (sometimes without immediate length changes) is also important. An expanded systematic, uniform analysis of many more glaciers is needed to isolate the glacier response components due to climatic and nonclimatic perturbations, to produce quantitative measures of regional variation in glacier changes, and to predict future regional glacier trends relevant to water resources, glaciological hazards, and global sea level. This comprehensive assessment (to be completed in stages) is expected to lend a critically needed filter to identify successful climate models that explain recent glacier changes and change patterns (and hence, are apt to describe future changes) and to eliminate unsuccessful models.","GLIMS,Glacier monitoring,Cryosphere,ASTER,Glacier Land Ice Measurements from Space,"
"changes in water properties around north pacific intermediate water between the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s","2010","We detected temperature (salinity) decreases on the neutral density surfaces above the salinity minimum and increases below throughout the western North Pacific subtropical gyre (25∘N–40∘N, west of 170∘W) by comparing World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) hydrographic sections from the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s. The temperature (salinity) changes around the salinity minimum were associated with an apparent oxygen utilization (AOU) increase, and could not be explained by an increase of the subpolar input. These property changes were due to a density decrease of the salinity minimum. Furthermore, similar changes in temperature (salinity) were detected along 165∘E as a 12-year trend from 1996 to 2007. This suggests that the changes evident in the comparison of the WOCE sections are the representative of changes at the intermediate depths in the last decade. This pattern was not detected in the eastern subtropical gyre (25∘N–40∘N, east of 170∘W) and along 47∘N, where the AOU increase due to ventilation reduction has been reported.

"reconstructing grace-like time series of high mountain glacier mass anomalies","2022","High mountain glaciers (HMGs), called the water towers of the world, are vulnerable to the effects of climate change and thus are rapidly shrinking. Monitoring and evaluating large-scale glacier and snow (GS) mass changes are critical for humans and ecosystems. Although modern gravity satellites monitor GS on a global scale, the contemporary Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and GRACE Follow−On (GRACE−FO) missions are only able to do so at coarse spatial resolutions and are restricted by their limited observation periods. Moreover, because of the complex mechanism behind a glacier's mass balance, existing reconstruction methods for GRACE-like mass anomalies, including machine learning approaches and statistical models, cannot be applied to HMGs. Here, we propose a precipitation and temperature data-driven statistical model combining hydrology and GS processes to reconstruct GRACE-like mass anomalies of HMGs, from which the hydrological and GS signals can be further separated. The prediction and reconstruction performance of this method was consistent with the GRACE/GRACE−FO observations (the median correlation coefficient/Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency: ~0.92/0.85). Additionally, the separated GS signals agreed with the independent external data used for comparison. Compared with machine learning methods, this method better reconstructed the long-term trend of GRACE-like mass anomalies. Our study provides an acceptable method for expanding mass anomaly time series on HMGs, thereby assisting in the sustainable management and protection of water resources in their downstream areas.","A statistical model,Glaciers and snow,Separation,Hydrological signal,Reconstruction,"
"textual risk mining for maritime situational awareness","2014","In this paper, we propose an auxiliary Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) integrated system for maritime situational awareness (MSA) operations. We bring into account a new and influential asset - human intuition and perception - to the existing semi-automated decision support systems that mostly rely on numerical data collected by electronic sensors or cameras located either directly on the vessels or in the maritime command-and-control centers. For our project, we gathered weekly textual reports spanning twelve months from the United States Worldwide Threats to Shipping Reports repository that belongs to the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), We considered the maritime incident reports written by human operators as a valuable and accessible unstructured textual input source in which a span of text1 is called â€œriskâ€ if it expresses one of the following kinds of vessel incidents: fired, robbed, boarded, hijacked, attacked, chased, approached, kidnapped, boarding attempted, suspiciously approached or clashed with. Our approach benefits from probability distributions of some useful features annotated based on a list of lexicons that contain expressions denoting vessel types, risks types, risk associates, maritime geographical locations, dates and times. These distributions are captured and used to anchor the span of â€œrisksâ€ as they are described in the textual reports. After some preprocessing steps that include tokenization, named entity extraction and part-of-speech tagging, the textual risk mining system applies a variety of sequence classification algorithms, e.g., Conditional Random Fields, Conditional Markov Models and Hidden Markov Models in order to compare the risk classification performance. Empirical results show that our NLP/ML-based system can extract variable-length risk spans from the textual reports with about 90% correctness.","Markov processes,decision support systems,hidden Markov models,statistical distributions,tokenization,Risk management,attacked vessel incident,human intuition,Hidden Markov models,maritime geographical locations,conditional Markov models,maritime domain awareness,maritime command-and-control centers,Feature extraction,natural language processing,chased vessel incident,entity extraction,variable-length risk span extraction,maritime incident reports,maritime situational awareness,sequence classification algorithms,conditional random fields,robbed vessel incident,electronic sensors,United States worldwide threats to shipping reports repository,maritime situational awareness operation,fired vessel incident,marine safety,National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency,marine engineering,boarded vessel incident,feature annotation,machine learning,semiautomated decision support systems,cameras,part-of-speech tagging,risk management,NLP/ML-based system,Classification algorithms,probability distributions,risks types,risk classification performance,textual risk mining system,weekly textual reports,auxiliary ML,auxiliary machine learning,hijacked vessel incident,command and control systems,vessels,human perception,vessel types,MSA operation,kidnapped vessel incident,risk associates,risk detection,NGA,text analysis,boarding attempted vessel incident,approached vessel incident,Data mining,learning (artificial intelligence),sequence-based classifiers,"
"data imputation in iot using spatio-temporal variational auto-encoder","2023","In most Internet of Things (IoT) scenes, data missing can be unavoidable when huge number of smart devices are collecting data uninterruptedly. Therefore, data imputation can be an integral part of pre-processing before data mining. It is widely known that IoT time series show strong dependencies in both spatial and temporal dimension, and the spatial relation among the devices is in non-euclidean space. However, most machine-learning-based and deep-learning-based approaches either only take temporal features into account or only catch spatial features in euclidean space. In this paper, we propose a novel network as ST-VAE (Spatio-Temporal Variational Auto-Encoder) to address the problem above. Our architecture is mainly based on Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE).

One is for calculating the adjacent matrix of device network which is the essential input of GCN, and the other is for data imputation task based on the spatial and temporal dependencies.

"seamless and intelligent resource allocation in 6g maritime networks framework via deep reinforcement learning","2023","Sixth-generation (6G) communication networks will fulfill usersâ€™ requests for high data speeds and low latency without causing network outages throughout the world. However, marine communication in deep-sea waters is expanding as maritime traffic grows. To serve mission-critical applications, a growing number of maritime end-users require high throughput and low latency. Although deep-sea satellite connections will enable 6G networks, however due to limited service capacity owing to the long propagation delay between end-user and satellites. We propose unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as aerial backhauling and a relay medium in the marine communication network assisted by satellites and coastal base stations (BSs). The power allocation strategy of multi-satellites for a 6G network is investigated in this work. The power allocation problem is non-convex, hence deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is used to solve it instead of the conventional optimization technique. Our research aims to optimize the networkâ€™s total capacity in the case when the satellites are randomly and densely dispersed. We provide a deep neural network and a method for mapping wireless power allocation for multi-satellites. The proposed technique can achieve a better overall capacity in comparison to the water-filling and the Q-learning method. The simulation results further demonstrate that the suggested technique offers a notable increase in stability and convergence speed.","Satellites,telecommunication network reliability,unmanned aerial vehicles,deep neural network,maritime end-users,maritime traffic,sixth-generation communication networks,deep learning (artificial intelligence),service capacity,6G,telecommunication computing,deep-sea satellite connections,long propagation delay,Power system stability,Wireless communication,6G maritime networks framework,power allocation problem,power allocation strategy,deep reinforcement learning,marine users,network outages,conventional optimization technique,mission-critical applications,Q-learning method,multisatellites,6G mobile communication,reinforcement learning,Power distribution,satellite networks,autonomous aerial vehicles,wireless power allocation,satellites,deep-sea waters,end-user,aerial backhauling,marine communication,Deep learning,marine communication network,Spectral efficiency,learning (artificial intelligence),resource allocation,high data speeds,coastal base stations,"
"multiple ornsteinâ€“uhlenbeck processes for maritime traffic graph representation","2018","We propose an unsupervised procedure to automatically extract a graph-based model of commercial maritime traffic routes from historical Automatic Identification System (AIS) data. In the proposed representation, the main elements of maritime traffic patterns, such as maneuvering regions and sea-lanes, are represented, respectively, with graph vertices and edges. Vessel motion dynamics are defined by multiple Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes with different long-run mean parameters, which in our approach can be estimated with a change detection procedure based on Page's test, aimed to reveal the spatial points representative of velocity changes. A density-based clustering algorithm is then applied to aggregate the detected changes into groups of similar elements and reject outliers. To validate the proposed graph-based representation of the maritime traffic, two performance criteria are tested against a real-world trajectory dataset collected off the Iberian Coast and the English Channel. Results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach, which is suitable to be integrated at any level of a JDL system.","automatic identification system data,unsupervised learning,density-based clustering algorithm,Marine vehicles,maritime traffic routes,Mathematical model,JDL system,maritime traffic patterns,Pages Test OU Process,maneuvering regions,Stochastic processes,Electronic mail,Maritime Surveillance Awareness (MSA),DBSCAN,ships,vessel motion dynamics,marine engineering,spatial points representative,Page's test,Data models,unsupervised procedure,maritime traffic graph representation,pattern clustering,Artificial intelligence,English Channel,graph theory,Trajectory,multiple Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes,trajectory dataset,sea-lanes,long-run mean parameters,Iberian Coast,collision avoidance,AIS data,Graph-based Maritime Traffic Representation,change detection procedure,"
"a machine learning approach for monitoring ship safety in extreme weather events","2021","Extreme weather events can result in loss of life, environmental pollution and major damage to vessels caught in their path. Many methods to characterise this risk have been proposed, however, they typically utilise deterministic thresholds of wind and wave limits which might not accurately reflect risk. To address this limitation, we investigate the potential of machine learning algorithms to quantify the relative likelihood of an incident during the US Atlantic hurricane season. By training an algorithm on vessel traffic, weather and historical casualty data, accident candidates can be identified from historic vessel tracks. Amongst the various methods tested, Support Vector Machines showed good performance with Recall at 95% and Accuracy reaching 92%. Finally, we implement the developed model using a case study of Hurricane Matthew (October 2016). Our method contributes to enhancements in maritime safety by enabling machine intelligent risk-aware ship routing and monitoring of vessel transits by Coastguard agencies.","Maritime risk assessment,Severe weather events,Machine learning,Navigation safety,"
"decade-low aerosol levels over the bohai and yellow seas amid the covid-19 lockdown","2022","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has crucially influenced anthropogenic activities, which in turn impacts upon the environment. In this study, we investigated the variations on aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 550 nm over the Bohai Sea and Yellow Sea during the COVID-19 lockdown (from February to March in 2020) of China mainland based on Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) observation by comparing with historical AOD records (2011–2019). Our results show that with the lockdown implementation, the decade-low AOD levels are achieved in February and March 2020 (0.39 ± 0.18 and 0.37 ± 0.19, respectively), which are 22% and 28% (p < 0.01) lower than the average AOD between 2011 and 2019 (0.50 ± 0.08 and 0.52 ± 0.05, respectively). After the lockdown restrictions were relaxed and industrial production gradually resumed, the AOD in April 2020 rebounded to the historical average level. Besides, compared with historical observations (2011–2019), the AOD temporal variability from February to April 2020 showed different pattern, with the decade-high increase from March to April (+0.11) and decade-low increase from February to March (-0.01). Independent observations and simulation, including fine particulate matter (PM2.5) from ground-based measurements, wind field from Cross-Calibrated Multi-Platform, satellite-derived aerosol type, and back trajectories calculation by Hybird Single Paricle Lagrangian Intergrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model, indicated that the above abnormal AOD variation can be attributed to reduction of anthropogenic emissions during the COVID-19 lockdown period. The results of this paper, therefore, indicate that aerosols over the Bohai and Yellow Seas are strongly influenced by human activities, and the public health events such as the epidemic may alter the intensity of human activities and thus the spatio-temporal pattern of aerosol over ocean. With the global spread of the epidemic and the corresponding significant changes in human behavior patterns (restrictions on human activities, etc.), more studies should be carried out in the future about the aerosol variability and its potential impact on the marine environment.","PM,AOD,Bohai Sea and Yellow Sea,COVID-19,Decade-low,Lockdown,"
"the wedge clam (donax trunculus) hand-operated fishery in the nw mediterranean sea: landings, catch composition, damage rates and impact of fishing activity","2023","The bivalve wedge clam Donax trunculus is a highly valued species in Spain, but wild stocks have decreased in the Mediterranean region in recent decades. Internal demand exceeds the existing supply derived from local production. Hand-operated dredge fishery is still important in some coastal areas of Spain, such as the Ebro Delta (NE Spain). However, scientific information is lacking on most aspects of this fishery which is essential for its sustainable management. In this context, this study aimed to provide the first characterization of the hand-operated dredges fishery; evaluate the damage of this fishery on the megabenthic fauna; and analyze the impact of the fishing activity on the wedge clam. Our results indicate that landings declined dramatically since the mid-1990s and the main causes for this decline are postulated. Fishing effort was highly seasonal, being more intense from March to September. The discard fraction was very small (5.74% in abundance and the 3.74% in biomass) and 61.93% of the discards did not suffer damage. Clam fishing activity had an impact on recruit density in the short term (3 months), but not on recruit size and commercial fraction density, biomass and size. Our results provide tools for a better management of this type of fisheries.","Small-scale fisheries,Wedge clam,Clam fisheries,Management,"
"north american vegetation dynamics observed with multi-resolution satellite data","2008","We investigated normalized difference vegetation index data from the NOAA series of Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometers and found regions in North America that experienced marked increases in annual photosynthetic capacity at various times from 1982 to 2005. Inspection of these anomalous areas with multi-resolution data from Landsat, Ikonos, aerial photography, and ancillary data revealed a range of causes for the NDVI increases: climatic influences; severe drought and subsequent recovery; irrigated agriculture expansion; insect outbreaks followed by logging and subsequent regeneration; and forest fires with subsequent regeneration. Vegetation in areas in the high Northern Latitudes appear to be solely impacted by climatic influences. In other areas examined, the impact of anthropogenic effects is more direct. The pattern of NDVI anomalies over longer time periods appear to be driven by long-term climate change but most appear to be associated with climate variability on decadal and shorter time scales along with direct anthropogenic land cover conversions. The local variability of drivers of change demonstrates the difficulty in interpreting changes in NDVI and indicates the complex nature of changes in the carbon cycle within North America. Coarse scale analysis of changes could well fail to identify the important local scale drivers controlling the carbon cycle and to identify the relative roles of disturbance and climate change. Our results document regional land cover land use change and climatic influences that have altered continental scale vegetation dynamics in North America.","Landsat,NDVI,Climate,Land cover,Vegetation dynamics,AVHRR,"
"material discrimination using scattering and stopping of cosmic ray muons and electrons: differentiating heavier from lighter metals as well as low-atomic weight materials","2015","Reported is a new method to apply cosmic-ray tomography in a manner that can detect and characterize not only dense assemblages of heavy nuclei (like Special Nuclear Materials, SNM) but also assemblages of medium- and light-atomic-mass materials (such as metal parts, conventional explosives, and organic materials). Characterization may enable discrimination between permitted contents in commerce and contraband (explosives, illegal drugs, and the like). Our Multi-Mode Passive Detection System (MMPDS) relies primarily on the muon component of cosmic rays to interrogate Volumes of Interest (VOI). Muons, highly energetic and massive, pass essentially un-scattered through materials of light atomic mass and are only weakly scattered by conventional metals used in industry. Substantial scattering and absorption only occur when muons encounter sufficient thicknesses of heavy elements characteristic of lead and SNM. Electrons are appreciably scattered by light elements and stopped by sufficient thicknesses of materials containing medium-atomic-mass elements (mostly metals). Data include simulations based upon GEANT and measurements in the HMT (Half Muon Tracker) detector in Poway, CA and a package scanner in both Poway and Socorro NM. A key aspect of the present work is development of a useful parameter, designated the “stopping power” of a sample. The low-density regime, comprising organic materials up to aluminum, is characterized using very little scattering but a strong variation in stopping power. The medium-to-high density regime shows a larger variation in scattering than in stopping power. The detection of emitted gamma rays is another useful signature of some materials.","Material properties,Contraband,Radiation length,Homeland security,Cosmic rays,Highly enriched uranium,"

"climate reconstructions for the last glacial maximum from a simple cirque glacier in fiordland, new zealand","2022","Mountain glacier records offer important constraints on the timing and magnitude of climate variability during the last glacial cycle. Existing moraine chronologies from the central Southern Alps indicate maximum ice extent was achieved during marine isotope stages 3–4, followed by repeated advances of similar, but gradually declining extent during marine isotope stage 2, until onset of the glacial termination. Questions remain over the precise role of climate in driving these changes, as most existing moraine chronologies come from large, complex former valley glacier systems, where non-climatic influences such as changing bed topography and proglacial lake formation may have influenced glacier length changes. Here we address this problem via a new cosmogenic 10Be chronology and equilibrium line altitude reconstruction from a cirque glacier situated in Fiordland, New Zealand. Our chronology shows moraine deposition at 32 ± 11 ka, 18.7 ± 0.2 ka, 18.1 ± 0.1 ka, and c. 17.2 ± 0.3 ka. The simple geometry of the former glacier supports the role of climate in driving a net decline of regional ice volume during marine isotope stages 3–2. Close spacing and good preservation of the 19–17 ka moraines permits 2D glacier reconstruction which suggests the equilibrium line altitude remained depressed by c.1130 m (equivalent to 5.8 ± 0.6 °C colder than present) during this interval. Onset of warming after 17.2 ± 0.2 ka is consistent with climate proxy evidence for a sustained southward shift in the southern westerly winds, which may have promoted deglaciation via shifting ocean currents and promoting increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide.","Glaciation,Pleistocene,Quaternary,Geomorphology,Southern pacific,Degree day modelling,Cosmogenic isotopes,Equilibrium line altitude,Paleoclimatology,Glacial,"
"extreme precipitation in the netherlands: an event attribution case study","2018","Attributing the change in likelihood of extreme weather events, particularly those occurring at small spatiotemporal scales, to anthropogenic forcing is a key challenge in climate science. While a warmer world is associated with an increase in atmospheric moisture on a global scale, the impact on the magnitude of extreme precipitation episodes has substantial regional variability. Analysis of individual cases is important in understanding the extent of these changes on spatial scales relevant to stakeholders. Here, we present a probabilistic attribution analysis of the extreme precipitation that fell in large parts of the Netherlands on 28 July 2014. Using a step-by-step approach, we aim to identify changes in intensity and likelihood of such an event as a result of anthropogenic global warming while highlighting the challenges in performing robust event attribution on high-impact precipitation events that occur at small scales. A method based on extreme value theory is applied to observational data in addition to global and regional climate model ensembles that pass a robust model evaluation process. Results based on observations suggest a strong and significant increase in the intensity and frequency of a 2014-type event as a result of anthropogenic climate change but trends in the model ensembles used are considerably smaller. Our results are communicated alongside considerable uncertainty, highlighting the difficulty in attributing events of this nature. Application of our approach to convection-resolving models may produce a more robust attribution.",""
"footprint and detectability of a well leaking co2 in the central north sea: implications from a field experiment and numerical modelling","2019","Existing wells pose a risk for the loss of carbon dioxide (CO2) from storage sites, which might compromise the suitability of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) and carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies as climate change mitigation options. Here, we show results of a controlled CO2 release experiment at the Sleipner CO2 storage site and numerical simulations that evaluate the detectability and environmental consequences of a well leaking CO2 into the Central North Sea (CNS). Our field measurements and numerical results demonstrate that the detectability and impact of a leakage of <55 t yr−1 of CO2 would be limited to bottom waters and a small area around the leak, due to rapid CO2 bubble dissolution in seawater within the lower 2 m of the water column and quick dispersion of the dissolved CO2 plume by strong tidal currents. As such, the consequences of a single well leaking CO2 are found to be insignificant in terms of storage performance. Only prolonged leakage along numerous wells might compromise long-term CO2 storage and may adversely affect the local marine ecosystem. Since many abandoned wells leak natural gas into the marine environment, hydrocarbon provinces with a high density of wells may not always be the most suitable areas for CO2 storage.","North Sea,Carbon dioxide,Leakage,Wells,Geological storage,Sleipner,"

This work provides scientific basis for future studies on environmental research and fills the gap in knowledge on the worldwide continental platforms. Metal distributions identified three different zones, mainly influenced by industrial and urban sewer (northern areas), agriculture runoffs (central zone), and estuarine discharges (southern areas), respectively. In the north part of the shelf, metal enrichments are observed near industrial and urban sewer mouths (Casablanca and Mohammedia cities). In the south and central areas, the probable absence of human impact on sediments is attributed to effective trapping in the estuary (Oum Er Rbia) and coastal zones, as well as dilution with less contaminated sediments and shelf sediments and removal with fine fractions due to estuary discharges.","Heavy metals,Environmental assessment,Atlantic shelf,Anthropogenic input,Sediment quality,"
"the real-time reliable detection of the horizon line on high-resolution maritime images for unmanned surface-vehicle","2020","Horizon detection is useful in maritime image processing for various purposes, such as spatial orientation estimation of ship camera and detection of the significant region for post-processing. This paper proposed a novel realtime optimization-based method for detecting the horizon line in maritime images. Traditional methods defined the horizon line detection problem aim to detect the horizon line which perfectly divides the whole image into two regions as the sky and sea. Thus, the complication of traditional methods is the statistical distance metrics of distributions are calculated in the whole image by all combinations of the horizon line parameters. Moreover, traditional methods do not provide realtime processing to detect the horizon line from high-resolution images. To achieve real-time processing on high-resolution images, this study defines the local features of the horizon line using a vanishing line characteristic and the optimization criteria. In addition, the optimization process is improved by combining a genetic algorithm and a coarse-to-fine approach. Our method applied the Singapore marine dataset and the Buoy dataset. To verify the proposed method, our result is compared to the state of the art methods.

"eprd: exploiting prior knowledge for evidence-providing automatic rumor detection","2023","With the prevalence of social media platforms, rumors have been a serious social problem. Notably, existing rumor detection methods simply provide detection labels while ignoring their explanation. However, illustrating the reasons why a suspicious statement is a rumor is essential. To address this realistic scenario, we propose a novel Evidence-Providing Rumor Detection model called EPRD. EPRD incorporates a wide variety of information from both prior knowledge sources and current comments. It also learns bilaterally friendly representations for interpretable rumor detection. EPRD first retrieves evidence from prior knowledge sources and checks the relationship between the given statement and its evidence. Our model then constructs two heterogeneous graph objects to simulate the propagation layout of the current comments and evidence relationships. Finally, EPRD integrates the GraphSAGE component and attention mechanism to detect rumors. To the best of our knowledge, we propose the first model that incorporates prior knowledge to verify rumors and boost credibility. Experiments on two real-world Twitter datasets demonstrate that EPRD consistently exhibits the best rumor detection performance. Moreover, EPRD outperforms other baselines in the early rumor detection task.","Deep learning,Graph neural network,Rumor detection,Evidence,Natural language inference,"
"leaf phenology paradox: why warming matters most where it is already warm","2018","Interactions between climate and ecosystem properties that control phenological responses to climate warming and drought are poorly understood. To determine contributions from these interactions, we used space-borne remotely sensed vegetation indices to monitor leaf development across climate gradients and ecoregions in the southeastern United States. We quantified how air temperature, drought severity, and canopy thermal stress contribute to changes in leaf flushing from mountainous to coastal plain regions by developing a hierarchical state-space Bayesian model. We synthesized daily field climate data with daily vegetation indices and canopy surface temperature during spring green-up season at 59 sites in the southeastern United States between 2001 and 2012. Our results demonstrated strong interaction effects between ecosystem properties and climate variables across ecoregions. We found spring green-up is faster in the mountains, while coastal forests express a larger sensitivity to inter-annual temperature anomalies. Despite our detection of a decreasing trend in sensitivity to warming with temperature in all regions, we identified an ecosystem interaction: Deciduous dominated forests are less sensitive to warming than are those with fewer deciduous trees, likely due to the continuous presence of leaves in evergreen species throughout the season. Mountainous forest green-up is more susceptible to intensifying drought and moisture deficit, while coastal areas are relatively resilient. We found that with increasing canopy thermal stress, defined as canopy-air temperature difference, leaf development slows following dry years, and accelerates following wet years.","Multispectral,NDVI,Southeastern US,Warming,Spring,EVI,Land surface temperature,Forest,Phenology,Green-up,Hierarchical modeling,Daily Vegetation Index,Bayesian,MODIS,Climate change,"
"an identity-based data integrity auditing scheme for cloud-based maritime transportation systems","2023","With the development of Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled Maritime Transportation Systems (MTS), massive data generated in the system not only requires to be stored reliably and cheaply, but also needs to be analyzed timely. The Cloud-based Maritime Transportation Systems (CMTS) allow users to upload the data without worrying about the price, capacity, location and so on. However, CMTS also brings some security issues, where the integrity protection of outsourced data is one of the most important issues since it is crucial for the safety, reliability and efficiency of sea lanes. To solve this problem, we propose an identity-based dynamic data integrity auditing scheme for CMTS. Our scheme decreases the burden of key management and improves the auditing efficiency by batch auditing. Besides, our scheme also supports dynamic operations on the outsourced data for CMTS. The security analysis shows that our scheme can ensure the feature of storage correctness and resist common attacks.

"unsupervised maritime vessel re-identification with multi-level contrastive learning","2023","Re-identification (re-ID) of maritime vessels plays an important role in marine surveillance, but remains highly unexplored due to the lack of large-scale annotated datasets. In vessel re-ID, contrastive methods are supposed to learn discriminative representation from unlabeled vessel images in an unsupervised manner. However, directly introducing classical instance-level contrastive methods to maritime vessel re-ID suffers from the difficulty of finding vessel images with the same pseudo label as positive images, which potentially leads to inefficient training and unsatisfactory performance. This paper proposes a simple but effective method to solve such a hard positive problem. Our method takes all images in an intra-batch cluster as positives and excludes them from the set of negative samples when computing instance-level contrastive loss. Based on this strategy, we construct a multi-level contrastive learning (MCL) framework for vessel re-ID trained with the specifically designed intra-batch cluster-level contrastive loss along with the instance-level one. Experiments on a newly proposed dataset consisting of 1,248 vessel identities show that MCL achieves the state-of-the-art performance compared with other unsupervised methods.","object recognition,discriminative representation,unsupervised learning,Cameras,Unsupervised learning,Vessel re-identification,instance-level contrastive loss,contrastive learning,intra-batch cluster-level contrastive loss,image representation,MCL,Intelligent transportation systems,unsupervised maritime vessel re-identification,pattern clustering,multilevel contrastive learning,maritime vessel re-ID,vessel identities,Training,large-scale annotated datasets,Representation learning,positive images,unlabeled vessel images,Surveillance,Task analysis,marine surveillance,"

Here we investigate two types of path: a linear combination (Euclidean geodesic) and a construction relying on an optimal transport map (2-Wasserstein geodesic). We test our extension by performing image denoising and k-sparse representation using atoms from a learned overcomplete kSVD dictionary. We study the application of our techniques on SWIR imagery of maritime vessels and show that our methods outperform orthogonal matching pursuit.

"random finite set tracking for anomaly detection in the presence of clutter","2020","In this paper, a sequential Bayesian framework is proposed to address the task of joint anomaly detection and tracking for surveillance applications in the presence of clutter. This is achieved by modeling the anomaly as a switching unknown control input which goes into action by modifying the expected dynamics of a target and ceases its activity (becomes nonexistent) under nominal behavior. Random Finite Sets (RFS) make it possible to represent the switching nature of the object anomalous behavior and derive a hybrid Bernoulli filter (HBF) that sequentially updates the joint posterior density of a Bernoulli RFS for the unknown velocity input and the object kinematic state. In addition, the proposed HBF has been customized for maritime anomaly detection by using a piecewise Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) stochastic process as dynamic model of vessels.

We present a method joining the intra-class uncertainty achieved using Monte Carlo Dropout, with recent discoveries in the field of outlier detection, to gain more holistic uncertainty measures. We explore the relationship between the introduced uncertainty measures and examine how well they work on CIFAR10 and in a real-life setting. Our work improves the FPR95 by 8% compared to the current highest-performing work when the models are trained without out-of-distribution data. We increase the performance by 77% compared to a vanilla implementation of the Wide ResNet.

"spatio-temporal reconstruction of snow avalanche activity using dendrogeomorphological approach in bucegi mountains romanian carpathians","2014","Snow avalanches cause damage to tourism infrastructure and loss of human life. In mountain areas where snow avalanches are less scientifically documented, the dendrogeomorphological approach is the best way for snow–avalanche activity reconstruction and to investigate the magnitude and frequency of the avalanches. Our study was conducted in the Bucegi Mountains located in the eastern part of the Southern Carpathians (Romanian Carpathians) in the Sinaia ski area, the most important ski area in the Romanian Carpathians. The mountains are characterised by high elevations of over 2400–2500m, a harsh climate (−2.5°C mean annual air temperature above 2500masl, over 130days with snowfall on average, over 185days with deep snow on average and 10–12months with a snow layer). Snow avalanche activity is marked by tilted trunks, scars and broken trees. Therefore, we applied the dendrogeomorphological approach. We performed a dendrogeomorphic analysis based on 66 Picea abies and 48 Larix decidua Mill. We sampled trees in two snow avalanche tracks, 43 in one and 71 in the other, and obtained 86 and 142 samples, respectively. Our results from tree-ring records yielded 32 snow avalanche winters in the 1963–2011 chronology in one track and 27 snow avalanche winters in the 1963–2012 chronology in the other track. Thus, we obtained important information about the spatial and temporal characteristics of snow avalanche activity. The small and medium snow avalanches cover the central and lateral parts of the stands, whilst the large snow avalanches reach the runout zone of the stands. We dated past snow avalanches and obtained a return period ranging from 13.7 to 15.2years. The analysis revealed that 14 winters had an activity index over 10% 4 winters had an activity index over 20% in the first avalanche track, 10 winters had an activity index over 10% and 4 winters had an activity index over 20% in the second avalanche track. On the other hand, to determine the relationship between snow avalanches and winter temperatures we use the Winter Standardized Index (WSI) between 1963 and 2012. We obtained a correlation between these parameters and our dendrogeomorphological results; the probability of major snow avalanche occurrence was highest during cold winters.","Norway spruce (),European larch ( Mill.),Dendrogeomorphological approach,Bucegi Mountains,Romanian Carpathians,Snow avalanche,"
"vegetation and climate change, fire-regime shifts and volcanic disturbance in chiloé continental (43°s) during the last 10,000 years","2015","Disentangling the roles of paleofires and explosive volcanism from climatic drivers of past vegetation change is a subject insufficiently addressed in the paleoecological literature. The coastal region of the Chiloé Continental sector of northwestern Patagonia is ideal in this regard considering its proximity to active eruptive centers and the possibility of establishing comparisons with more distal, upwind sites where volcanic influence is minimal. Here we present a fine-resolution pollen and macroscopic charcoal record from Lago Teo with the aim of documenting the local vegetation and climate history, and assessing the role of disturbance regimes as drivers of vegetation change during the last ∼10,000 years. The Lago Teo record shows a conspicuous warm/dry interval between ∼7500 and 10,000 cal yrs BP followed by a cooling trend and increase in precipitation that has persisted until the present, in agreement with previous studies in the region and interpretations of past southern westerly wind activity at multi-millennial scales. The presence of 26 tephras throughout the record allows examination of the relationship between explosive volcanism and vegetation change under contrasting climatic states of the Holocene. We found consistent statistically significant increases in Tepualia stipularis after tephra deposition over the last 10,000 years, in Eucryphia/Caldcluvia between 7500 and 10,000 cal yrs BP and in Hydrangea over the last 7500 years. Our results indicate a primary role of climate change as driver of long-term vegetation change and as a modulator of vegetation responses to volcanic disturbance at multidecadal and centennial timescales.","Northwestern Patagonia,Chiloé Continental,Volcanic disturbance,Temperate rainforest,"

"eeg-based maritime object detection for iot-driven surveillance systems in smart ocean","2020","Automated maritime object detection is a significant research challenge in intelligent marine surveillance systems for the Internet of Things (IoT) and smart ocean applications. In particular, ship detection is recognized as one of the core research issues of these IoT-driven intelligent marine surveillance systems. Traditional methods based on machine learning have made some achievements in detection tasks for specific objects. However, the ship objects are relatively small, and they are usually not accurately detected. In this article, we propose an electroencephalography (EEG)-based maritime object detection algorithm for IoT-driven surveillance systems in the smart ocean. For this purpose, we conduct experiments to record the EEG signals of subjects when they are watching the maritime image scenes. With the feature analysis of EEG signals, the event-related potential (ERP) components associated with detecting objects are induced, such as the  $P3$  and  $N2$  components. Employing classification based on linear discriminant analysis (LDA), the area under curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) is used to evaluate the detection accuracy. We use this novel method to determine and identify essential objects and areas from IoT devices, such as digital camera imaging sensors. Our proposed method can not only help to detect small objects accurately using fewer samples but can also be used to reduce the data volume needed to be stored and transmitted in IoT-driven marine surveillance systems.","medical signal processing,surveillance,Electroencephalography,Electroencephalography (EEG),Internet of Things (IoT),ship detection,Internet of Things,Marine vehicles,maritime image scenes,Feature extraction,smart ocean applications,IoT-driven intelligent marine surveillance systems,maritime object detection,automated maritime object detection,ships,electroencephalography-based maritime object detection algorithm,Oceans,object detection,feature extraction,intelligent surveillance systems,IoT-driven marine surveillance systems,IoT devices,image sensors,smart ocean,Object detection,Surveillance,learning (artificial intelligence),electroencephalography,"
"vc-gan: classifying vessel types by maritime trajectories using generative adversarial networks","2020","As maritime transport is the backbone of global trade, it is important to ensure the safety and security for sea transportation effectively. However, the dependence on experienced human operators for maritime surveillance does not scale in terms of coverage. While the ship information and trajectory data from the Automatic Identification System (AIS) can be used to automate maritime surveillance, the AIS data may be modified deliberately or accidentally, resulting in difficulties in the detection of illegal maritime activities. We have developed VC-GAN for Vessel Classification using Generative Adversarial Networks to identify vessel types based solely on the vessel trajectories in areas of interest. Our VC-GAN framework adversarially trains a multi-class classifier by learning from the labelled AIS data to classify the types of the vessels of interest, as well as to detect the out-of-class vessels. We evaluated the proposed VC-GAN method on two maritime datasets in Europe and Southeast Asia. The experimental results showed that VC-GAN significantly outperformed other vessel classification methods, especially in detecting out-of-class vessels.","ship information,VC-GAN framework,Transportation,maritime datasets,trajectory data,Generative adversarial networks,vessel classification methods,global trade,experienced human operators,neural nets,labelled AIS data,maritime trajectories,ships,marine safety,marine engineering,maritime transport,generative adversarial networks,Automatic Identification System,maritime surveillance,illegal maritime activities,image classification,sea transportation,vessel trajectories,Artificial intelligence,Maritime Trajectories,VC-GAN method,vessel types,Trajectory,multiclass classifier,Vessel Type Classification,Surveillance,Tools,learning (artificial intelligence),Security,out-of-class vessels,Generative Adversarial Networks,"
"design of provably secure authentication protocol for edge-centric maritime transportation system","2023","The epidemic growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) objects have revolutionized Maritime Transportation Systems (MTS). Though, it becomes challenging for the centralized cloud-centric framework to fulfil the application requirements such as low latency and power utilization. The introduction of the distributed edge-centric framework has recently helped the IoT-enabled MTS to meet these requirements by manipulating the tasks at the edge of the networks. Despite the fact that MTS leverages mobile subscribers by overcoming inherent cloud computing limitations, data security and user privacy requirements in establishing the MTS setup are still non-trivial challenges. In this article, we develop a key agreement solution for mobile users to realize mutual authentication in a single round. Our protocol offers user anonymity to maintain user privacy, and it can prevent physical attacks by physically unclonable functions. Initially, the security analysis is conferred to substantiate our protocolâ€™s security persistence or strength. Later, its performance correlation is observed under the assumption of diverse metrics in a predefined empirical setup. The meticulous performance correlation endorses the precedence of our protocol over specified related protocols.","authentication protocol,Hash functions,mobile edge computing,Servers,authentication,Cloud computing,Protocols,Authentication,Internet of Things,Security,Mutual authentication,"
"the promises and perils of automatic identification system data","2021","Automatic Identification System (AIS) is used to identify vessels in maritime navigation. Currently, it is used for various commercial purposes. However, the abundance and lack of quality of AIS data make it difficult to capitalize on its value. Therefore, an understanding of both the limitations of AIS data and the opportunities is important to maximize its value, but these have not been clearly stated in the existing literature. This study aims to help researchers and practitioners understand AIS data by identifying both the promises and perils of AIS data. We identify the different applications and limitations of AIS data in the literature and build upon them in a sequential mixed-design study. We first identify the promises and perils that exist in the literature. We then analyze AIS data from the port of Amsterdam quantitatively to detect noise and to find the perils researchers and practitioners could encounter. Our results incorporate quantitative findings with qualitative insights obtained from interviewing domain experts. This study extends the literature by considering multiple limitations of AIS data across different domains at the same time. Our results show that the amount of noise in AIS data depends on factors such as the equipment used, external factors, humans, dense traffic etc. The contribution that our paper makes is in combining and making a comprehensive list of both the promises and perils of AIS data. Consequently, this study helps researchers and practitioners to (i) identify the sources of noise, (ii) to reduce the noise in AIS data and (iii) use it for the benefits of their research or the optimization of their operations.","Ship behavior analysis,Advanced applications of AIS data,Navigation safety,Environmental evaluation,Data mining,AIS data,"
"a bayesian iterative geomagnetic model with universal data input: self-consistent spherical harmonic evolution for the geomagnetic field over the last 4000 years","2019","Changes of the Earth's magnetic field have been observed with varying spatial and temporal resolution since the middle ages by means of compasses, and later by refined mechanical inclination and intensity instruments, until the modern use of quantum mechanical devices and satellite observations. Ancient records, on the other hand, rely on the natural magnetization of archaeological artifacts and other materials, such as rocks and sediments, being therefore indirect, less accurate and sparser. The combination of such heterogeneous records into a single, self-consistent, global model of the geomagnetic field is very challenging: the highly uneven data coverage, both in space and time, requires a careful handling of data uncertainties and error correlations. Previous models dealt with this problem using separated treatments of instrumental data and indirect records, respectively, as well as a different handling of the dipole field component, with respect to non-dipole terms. Here we present a global geomagnetic field model based, for the first time, on the simultaneous inversion of historical, archaeomagnetic, and volcanic records, using a Bayesian approach with minimal-committing time regularization that minimizes the energy of secular variation. A detailed assessment of data uncertainty and error correlation is used to minimize artifacts generated by the appearance of an overwhelming number of incomplete, mostly declination-only records, associated with shipboard measurements in the early colonial period. Our model yields lower dipole energies, which better match modern values, as well as higher non-dipole energies and a stronger secular variation of the dipole moment. Some model artifacts associated with extremely heterogeneous distributions of records in time and space are not completely eliminable and might be caused by incorrect a-priori uncertainty assessments. Alternatively, they might represent an intrinsic limit that can be overcome only by adding new records at critical locations and times.","Geomagnetism,Field modeling,Historical records,Secular variation,Archaeomagnetism,"
"novel climates: trajectories of climate change beyond the boundaries of british columbia’s forest management knowledge system","2018","The non-stationary climates of the 21st century are compelling forest managers to seek non-local species, provenances, and silvicultural regimes that are better suited to the anticipated future climates of their operating areas. Ideally, forest managers can source this information from climate analogs within their jurisdictions, but the emergence of unfamiliar climates is a distinct possibility with particular challenges. Here, we present an assessment of the emergence of mid-21st-century climates with no analog in the 20th-century climates of British Columbia (BC), and the extent to which these novel climates are described by climate analogs elsewhere in North America. We use a recently developed linear method of novel climate detection in parallel with Random Forest classification to evaluate the robustness of novel climate inferences. Our results suggest that a majority of the province’s area will remain free of novel climates over this time period, and therefore that BC’s ecological knowledge system, the Biogeoclimatic Ecosystem Classification, can remain the dominant source of climate analogs for mid-21st-century forest management planning horizons. Nevertheless, we detected a robust pattern of climates that are novel to BC in mid-21st-century climate projections at low elevations in the coastal, southern interior, and northeastern regions of the province. There appears to be potential to inform forest management in some of these novel climates with analogs from adjacent states and provinces. We demonstrate that extrapolations into novel climates typically understate the magnitude of climate change and modeling uncertainty, creating a false impression of robust predictions in locations where model performance is poorest. By identifying portions of their landscapes that are prone to emergence of novel climates, forest managers can avoid management errors and prioritize the search for analogs beyond the boundaries of their knowledge systems.","Mahalanobis distance,Bioclimate,No-analog,Novel climates,Random Forest,Biogeoclimatic ecosystem classification,"
"prediction of rendezvous in maritime situational awareness","2018","In this work, we consider the problem of algorithmically predicting rendezvous among vessels based on their trajectory forecasts in a maritime environment. The problem is treated as hypothesis testing on the expected value of the distance between trajectories. We relate this quantity to the first and second degree Wasserstein distances between trajectory forecast distributions. These distributions are obtained using integrated Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process models with the trajectory measurements collected so far. Building upon these results, we propose an algorithm which traverses the trajectories observed so far for detecting rendezvous over a rolling time horizon.

"the first detection of the madden-julian oscillation signal in daily to hourly resolution proxy records derived from a natural archive of giant clam shell (tridacna spp.)","2021","The Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) is the most prominent mode of intraseasonal variability in the tropics which is responsible for much of the observed intraseasonal climate variance not only there but also in higher latitudes. The short time-span of modern instrumental data limits our understanding of the MJO and obtaining MJO information from natural archives could extend this greatly. Here a Giant Clam shell (Tridacna spp.) with a life span about two years (from January 29, 2012 to December 9, 2013) was collected from the northern South China Sea, in the western Pacific. Several daily to hourly resolution biological and geochemical proxy records, including the daily growth rate, hourly Fe/Ca, Sr/Ca and fluorescence intensity, were developed to compare these with local weather/climate records. Spectral analyses suggested that these ultra-high resolution proxy records can clearly record MJO variability in the tropics. The substantial connection between the proxy records and MJO possibly linking through the local effective solar radiation, SST, precipitation and wind speeds. This is the first record of the MJO signal in a natural paleoclimate archive. Our findings provide new insights to study the MJO beyond the instrumental records, and since fossil Tridacna shells from different geological times can be used to investigate the MJO under various climate conditions.","shell,MJO,proxy records,daily growth rate,ultra-high-resolution,"
"modeling of interferences on other satellites in maritime satellite communications","2013","In maritime mobile satellite communications, mechanically controlled tracking systems are used to compensate changes of antenna orientation due to changes of a ship attitude caused by waves or winds of the sea. Orientations of antennas on a ship are limited so that transmitted electromagnetic waves are not affected by structures on the ship. Thus it is allowed to transmit waves when a clearance angle is greater than certain criteria. Our group has researched about fundamental relation between clearance angles and interferences for other satellites or other systems on the ship by numerical simulations for a simplified model. In this report, a realistic ship model is assumed for the simulations. As a result, a clearance angle, which interferences to the receiving satellite are small, has been found out under the conditions of the simulations. A simple model which describes interferences to received levels of the aiming and neighboring satellites is presented.","Satellites,interference model,maritime,satellite receiving,electromagnetic wave transmission,Marine vehicles,Satellite antennas,Bridges,antenna orientation,interference,Transmitting antennas,Satellite communications,ship structures,numerical simulations,mobile radio,reception level,radiofrequency interference,mobile antennas,tracking systems,ship attitude,Receiving antennas,ship antenna,marine communication,maritime mobile satellite communications,diffracted wave,numerical analysis,"

Past demonstrations of MSAR-based methods for improvements such as motion induced distortion correction and image classification were performed using a uniformly spaced array of phase centers. In this paper, we derive novel extensions of these techniques to the case of sparse and non-uniformly spaced phase center configurations and demonstrate their effectiveness for a variety of platforms and sensor arrangements. We establish general techniques for correcting motion induced distortions, establish theoretical bounds of performance, and empirically validate our techniques on data derived from our airborne MSAR system. We then use these images to characterize the structure of the maritime scene using our MSAR-based classification technique. Our imaging and classification techniques are amenable to efficient implementation on diverse hardware platforms and sensor arrangements, and thus can find ready application in practical multichannel radar systems.","Phased arrays,image classification,Synthetic aperture radar,Radar imaging,Classification algorithms,Multi-channel synthetic aperture radar (SAR),Imaging,Radar polarimetry,Arrays,ocean imaging,"
"data gap analysis of ship and maritime data using meta learning","2021","With the developments in new Internet of Things (IoT) technology, ship owners and managers can access and analyze vast amounts of real-time onboard data. However, data collected from the ship’s engine and navigation information include various types of errors owing to imprecision, bias, sensor failure, or human error caused by manual recording by the ship operator’s hands. Such abnormal data make accurate ship performance prediction and monitoring difficult; thus, the original data need to be carefully refined through data preprocessing. Machine learning models have been used to detect and remove abnormal data; however, this yields inconsistent predictions in results depending on the types of machine learning models used. In this study, a robust data gap analysis method is proposed to detect abnormal data among ship and marine data collected in real time. Data preprocessing, including rule-based data imputation, clustering, denoising, and dimension reduction, is systematically performed; subsequently, a meta-learning model, which is a combination of various machine learning models, is used to predict ship performance and detect its abnormal data. This study compared the performance of single-machine learning models and meta models through various error analysis methods that utilize actual ship operation data. The single machine leading models have various error values depending on types of data and models, while the meta model consistently has values of less than 5% of mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and relative root-mean-square error (RRMSE), showing a Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient(NSE) value of 0.7 or higher. Our proposed data gap analysis framework, including the meta-learning model, can be useful for monitoring the condition of ships, as it can more accurately and robustly classify them as normal or abnormal.","Data preprocessing,Machine learning error measures,Meta learning,Data gap analysis,"
"synergistic abiotic and biotic stressors explain widespread decline of pinus pinaster in a mixed forest","2019","Global change potentially increases forest vulnerability. Different abiotic and biotic factors may interact to cause forest decline and accelerated tree mortality. We studied a mixed Mediterranean continental forest where Pinus pinaster Ait. (maritime pine) shows widespread decline to analyse the role of different abiotic and biotic factors on health status and growth dynamics both at the individual and plot levels. We also analysed stand composition and regeneration of tree species to check whether there is a change in species dominance. Fungal pathogens were seldom present and we detected no pervasive fungi or insect infestation and no presence of pathogens like Heterobasidion or Phytophthora. Infection of hemiparasite plants like Viscum album L. (mistletoe) can reduce leaf area and its abundance is generally considered an expression of host decline. Yet, the existence among declining trees of high defoliation levels without mistletoe, but not vice versa, suggests that defoliation in response to some abiotic stressor could be a predisposing factor preceding mistletoe infection. Compared to healthy trees, declining and dead trees exhibited higher defoliation rates, smaller needles and lower recent growth with steeper negative trends. Dead and declining trees showed similar negative growth trends since the early 1990s droughts, which we interpreted as early warning signals anticipating mortality of currently declining trees in the near future. Mortality of maritime pine extending across all size classes, the lower presence of this species in the smallest size classes and its lack of regeneration suggest it is potentially losing its current dominance and being replaced by other co-occurring, more drought-tolerant species. Our results unravelled that maritime pine decline seems to be mainly driven by a combination of predisposing and inciting abiotic factors (microenvironment and drought stress) and biotic factors (mistletoe). The absence of widespread fungal pathogens suggests that they may have a minor role on pine decline acting only eventually as contributing factors. Although there could be other interrelations among factors or other biotic agents at play, our results strongly suggest that water stress plays a major role in the decline process of the dominant species on an ecosystem with strong land-use legacies.","Abiotic stress,Mistletoe,Defoliation,Drought,Land-use,Fungal pathogens,"
"reconstructing high-resolution climate using ct scanning of unsectioned stalagmites: a case study identifying the mid-holocene onset of the mediterranean climate in southern iberia","2015","The forcing mechanisms responsible for the mid-Holocene onset of the Mediterranean-type climate in south-western Europe are currently unclear, but understanding these is critical for accurate climate projections under future greenhouse gas warming. Additionally, regional studies that present conflicting patterns for the onset and advancement of Mediterranean climatic conditions complicate definitively ascribing causality. Here, we use a new high resolution stalagmite density record obtained non-destructively using Computed Tomography (CT scanning) to reconstruct southern Iberian climate between 9.3 and 2.9 ka BP. We suggest that stalagmite density can be used as a water-excess proxy, with lower densities associated with more variable drip rates, possibly reflecting increased seasonality consistent with expectations from previous studies of speleothem textures and crystal fabrics. Our results reveal an early Holocene humid interval and mid-Holocene year-round aridity that preceded the onset of Mediterranean climate at 5.3 ka BP in southern Iberia. Using this new dataset combined with previously published results, we link the gradual advancement of the Mediterranean climate to the southward migration of the North Atlantic Subtropical High induced by an orbitally driven decrease in Northern Hemisphere insolation. Future anthropogenic warming could result in a reversal of this trend, a northward migration of the North Atlantic Subtropical High, and a return to year-round aridity in south-western Europe.","CT scanning,Speleothem,NASH,Palaeoclimatology,Mediterranean,Holocene,"

"coral reef applications of sentinel-2: coverage, characteristics, bathymetry and benthic mapping with comparison to landsat 8","2018","The Sentinel-2A and 2B Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) offers a specification of potential value toward a number of objectives in remote sensing of coral reefs. Coral reefs represent a unique challenge for remote sensing, being highly heterogeneous at metre scales and occurring at variable depths and water clarity regimes. However, conservation initiatives, such as the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, add urgency to the need for the large scale environmental monitoring information that remote sensing can provide. In the quest to meet this challenge a range of satellite instruments have been leveraged, from Landsat to high spatial resolution sensors such as WorldView-2, toward objectives such as: mapping of bottom types, bathymetry, change detection, and detection of coral bleaching events. Sentinel-2A and 2B offer a new paradigm of available instruments, with a 5-day revisit, 10 m multispectral spatial resolution and freely available data. Pre-launch simulation analyses by several of the authors suggested Sentinel-2 would have good performance for reef applications, in this paper we follow up on this study by reviewing the potential based on the substantial archive of actual data now available. First we determine to what extent the World's reefs are covered by Sentinel-2, since the mission requirements do not by default include all reefs. Secondly we review how a 5-day revisit translates to a usable acquisition rate of clear images, given that cloud and surface glint are common confounding factors. The usable acquisition rate is the real determinant of the objectives to which the data can be applied. Finally we apply current processing algorithms to Sentinel-2 data of several sites over the Great Barrier Reef, including physics-based bathymetry inversion and object-orientated benthic mapping. Landsat 8 OLI is most comparable current sensor to Sentinel-2 MSI, so direct comparisons and the possibilities for data synthesis are explored. Our findings confirm that Sentinel-2 has excellent performance for meeting several essential coral reef scientific and monitoring objectives. Taking into account cloud and sun glint, the usable acquisition rate for a large proportion of reefs is likely to be around 20 clear images a year on average, giving a new potential for evaluation of short time-scale disturbances and impacts. The spatial resolution of 10 m is a key threshold for delineating benthic features of interest such as coral structures, and there is evidence from image and field data that bleaching is detectable. Radiometrically Sentinel-2 data can support good results in physics-based methods, such as bathymetric mapping, comparable to Landsat 8 and WorldView-2. In addition the large scale acquisition area, provided by the 290 km wide swath, offers advantages over high spatial resolution imagery for mapping at multi-reef scales. Sentinel-2 data can be immediately leveraged with existing methods, to provide a new level of reef monitoring information compared to that previously available by remote sensing. Combined with Landsat 8 and the historical Landsat archive, the data collected today will be invaluable for decades or even centuries to come. In this context, the main downside of the Sentinel-2 mission is that approximately 12% of the World's reefs currently lie outside the acquisition plan and are not imaged. Surprisingly, for a European initiative, coral reefs in European governed territories are among the worst served globally. These omissions, approximately only 1/200th of the currently imaged area, limit the global scope which otherwise would be one of Sentinel-2's greatest strengths.","Bathymetry,Landsat,Sentinel-2,Coral reefs,Habitat mapping,Sun glint,"
"ocean oil spill detection from sar images based on multi-channel deep learning semantic segmentation","2023","One of the major threats to marine ecosystems is pollution, particularly, that associated with the offshore oil and gas industry. Oil spills occur in the world's oceans every day, either as large-scale spews from drilling-rig or tanker accidents, or as smaller discharges from all sorts of sea-going vessels. In order to contribute to the timely detection and monitoring of oil spills over the oceans, we propose a new Multi-channel Deep Neural Network (M-DNN) segmentation model and a new and effective Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) image dataset, that enable us to emit forewarnings in a prompt and reliable manner. Our proposed M-DNN is a pixel-level segmentation model intended to improve previous DNN oil-spill detection models, by taking into account multiple input channels, complex oil shapes at different scales (dimensions) and evolution in time, and look-alikes from low wind speed conditions. Our methodology consists of the following components: 1) New Multi-channel SAR Image Database Development; 2) Multi-Channel DNN Model based on U-net and ResNet; and 3) Multi-channel DNN Training and Transfer Learning. Due to the lack of public oil spill databases guaranteeing a correct learning process of the M-DNN, we developed our own database consisting of 16 ENVISAT-ASAR images acquired over the Gulf of Mexico during the Deepwater Horizon (DWH) blowout, off the west coast of South Korea during the Hebei Spirit oil tanker collision, and over the Black Sea. These images were pre-processed to create a 3-channel input image IM = ","Oil spill detection,Deep learning,SAR images,Spatial filtering,"
"hydrological drought evaluation using grace satellite-based drought index over the lake basins, east africa","2022","Hydrological drought, a regular phenomenon that could heavily impact natural systems and human life, is aggravated by a water storage deficit. While Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite databased drought monitoring has been widely studied in East Africa (EA), drought recovery time and anthropogenic factors are still missing, which are prerequisite for drought management. Here, a water storage deficit index (WSDI) and modified WSDI are utilized for analyzing a holistic representation of drought. The results show that the drought events in recent times are well-identified and estimated using this approach over five lake basins in EA from 2002 to 2021. Although, the basin scale drought events are evaluated using the Pearson correlation coefficient (r) from 2002 to 2021. The results showed a significant correlation between WSDI, MWSDI, and the standardized precipitation-evapotranspiration index (SPEI) in all lake basins except in the Tana basin. We show that the presence of anthropogenic forcing has increased the highest peak deficits of −2.57, −3.25, −19.05, −87.2, and −99 km3 over the Tana, Abaya-Chamo, Turkana, Victoria, and Tanganyika basins, respectively. The longest deficit period of 36 months and the highest severity value of −1140 were observed in the Turkana and Victoria basins. The average drought recovery time ranges from 2.4 to 11.2 months and from 1.4 to 12.6 months as obtained by WSDI and MWSDI, respectively. Our findings highlight the importance of the calculated WSD approach to evaluating the hydrological drought characterization and estimate the drought condition at the basin scale.","Hydrological drought,GRACE data,Drought recovery time,Water storage deficit,Modified WSDI,"

The method assumes modeling vessels' motion by the Integrated Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process.

"keeping the baddies out and the bridge calm: embedded authentication for maritime networks","2022","Integrated bridges of todayâ€™s vessels are complex and distributed maritime systems that interconnect versatile electronic equipment. However, digitized vessels have long ceased to be isolated systems and are thus increasingly vulnerable to cyber attacks. In this context, integrity and authentication of the communication onboard is crucial. Therefore, we introduce MARMAC, a low-cost solution to retrofit authentication of nautical communication. MARMAC is based on symmetric cryptography and extends the prevalent IEC61162-450 protocol enabling a backward-compatible solution which mitigates common attacks. Using a specific gatekeeper approach, MARMAC can prevent unauthenticated messages from being processed that could otherwise affect the nautical situational awareness on the bridge.

"nmtlat: a new robust mobile multi-target localization and tracking scheme in marine search and rescue wireless sensor networks under byzantine attack","2020","After a shipwreck (ship collision, explosion, disappearance, etc.), people rely on the marine search and rescue wireless sensor networks (MSR-WSNs) as one key weapon to locate and track drowning targets to save lives and assets. However, due to the complex and dynamic ocean environment, marine sensors could be captured by malicious attackers and then become Byzantine sensors. Byzantine sensors may tamper with the actual sensor data at a fixed or time-varying probability and transmit it to the data fusion center (DFC), which renders the normal localization and tracking function of the search and rescue system downgrade or even fail. To address this issue, we develop a New robust marine mobile Multi-Target LocAlization and Tracking scheme called NMTLAT by eliminating abnormal measurement data from the initial measurement data. NMTLAT works in several steps. By analyzing and mining sensors data and behavior, we firstly employ the information entropy of the system composed of a single sensor and their neighbor sensors to develop an efficient dynamic threshold based Byzantine node identification method. After migrating Byzantine sensors, the DFC utilizes sensor-aware and preprocessed marine data of the beacon or honest sensors to complete target localization and trajectory tracking. Specifically, NMTLAT consists of a novel distributed and cooperative multi-target localization and tracking algorithm using both received signal strength indication (RSSI) and priori information of sensors location. NMTLAT employs the importance sampling method to approximate the posterior probability distribution of the sensors and targets location. Furthermore, when the marine target is outside MSR-WSNs coverage, a piecewise function is utilized to characterize the likelihood of finding a drowning target in the search and rescue sea area. Finally, the Lyapunov’s second stability theorem is adopted to measure the stability of the NMTLAT. Our extensive simulation experiments validate that the NMTLAT performance is superior to existing solutions in various marine search and rescue scenarios.","Importance sampling,Lyapunov’s stability theorem,Information entropy,Maritime search and rescue wireless sensor networks,Cooperative localization and tracking,Byzantine sensor identification,"

"compound-specific d/h ratios of the marine lakes of palau as proxies for west pacific warm pool hydrologic variability","2011","We tested the use of hydrogen isotopic ratios (δD) of lipids in marine lake sediments from the Micronesian Republic of Palau against the instrumental record of the last century to assess their capacity to record past hydrological changes of the Western Pacific Warm Pool. δD values of the algal lipid biomarker dinosterol (δDDino) and the more generic palmitic acid (δDPA) were found to be sensitive indicators of the intensity of regional precipitation, as recorded by the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI). The observed sensitivity is caused by the combined effect of: 1) The amount effect in tropical precipitation; 2) Dilution of the isotopically heavy saline surface waters with light precipitation; 3) A salinity effect on the biosynthetic D/H fractionation between lipid and lake water. Both lake water δD (δDLake) and δDDino could be expressed as a quadratic function of either precipitation or lake water salinity. δDDino values were used to reconstruct past hydrological changes of the region. Long-term variations in the strength and sign of the El Niño - Southern Oscillation (ENSO) since the Little Ice Age (LIA, ∼1450–1850 A.D.) and during the early Holocene (∼7–9 kyr BP) appeared to dominate decadal variability, and indicate very dry conditions during the LIA. Early Holocene δDDino values were on average ∼10‰ higher than those of recent centuries, which we interpret as a result of millennial scale hydrologic and water mass changes on a global level. The similar ∼35‰ range of δD changes during the early Holocene and last several centuries imply a similar range of decadal-centennial hydrologic variability during those two climate regimes. Our results indicate that a correlation exists between solar irradiance levels and tropical Pacific climate.","West Pacific Warm Pool,Marine lakes,Hydroclimate,Hydrogen isotopes,Paleoclimate,Biomarkers,Palau,"
"novel maritime channel models for millimeter radiowaves","2016","This work presents and analyzes the results of millimeter-wave propagation simulations performed for over the sea LoS ship to ship communication channels. We present a channel characterization study where channel parameters such as path loss, received power, RMS delay spread, and power delay profile are obtained by using a ray tracing approach. 5G candidate frequencies, 35 GHz and 94 GHz were chosen as the primary bands of interest since these two bands have minimum water and oxygen attenuation, thereby promising better performance among the other frequency bands. Our results indicate that 2-ray analytical propagation loss model should only be used for short ranges over the sea surface propagation at typical frequencies considered by 5G. However, free space path loss model cannot predict the behavior of channel over the sea surface in high frequencies even for short ranges. Therefore, in this study a new model that is the modified version of 2-ray path loss model is proposed, in which a coefficient in the power of exponential function is introduced to better predict the behavior of maritime channels of 5G. It is shown that the proposed model can predict the path loss of maritime channel better than the existing models.","ray tracing,millimeter radiowaves,free space path loss model,Ducts,wireless path loss,Delays,Mathematical model,Maritime channel modeling,novel maritime channel models,Predictive models,radiowaves,oxygen attenuation,exponential function,sea surface propagation,millimeter wave propagation simulations,Propagation losses,Sea surface,propagation loss model,sea LoS ship,maritime channels,channel parameters,wireless channels,marine communication,Receivers,ship communication channels,"
"maritime border security using sensors, processing, and platforms to detect dark vessels","2018","Maritime security is critical to national prosperity, but with a large area to be secured and limited resources available, our current maritime situational awareness is not sufficient to secure our borders. This challenge is compounded by the fact that many bad actors intentionally avoid using transponders to obscure their location and actions for nefarious purposes. New solutions are required to detect these â€œdarkâ€ vessels in the expansive maritime domain and thereby enable increased maritime situational awareness and security. In this paper, we present a concept for increased maritime situational awareness, specifically designed to secure our borders against dark vessels using a novel combination of existing technologies.

"an automated treatment plan alert system to safeguard cancer treatments in radiation therapy","2022","In radiation oncology, the intricate process of delivering radiation to a patient is detailed by the patient’s treatment plan, which is data describing the geometry, construction and strength of the radiation machine and the radiation beam it emits. The patient’s life depends upon the accuracy of the treatment plan, which is left in the hands of the vendor-specific software automatically generating the plan after an initial patient consultation and planning with a medical professional. However, corrupted and erroneous treatment plan data have previously resulted in severe patient harm when errors go undetected and radiation proceeds. The aim of this paper is to develop an automatic error-checking system to prevent the accidental delivery of radiation treatment to an area of the human body (i.e., the treatment site) that differs from the plan’s documented intended site. To this end, we develop a method for structuring treatment plan data in order to feed machine-learning (ML) classifiers and predict a plan’s treatment site. In practice, a warning may be raised if the prediction disagrees with the documented intended site. The contribution of this paper is in the strategic structuring of the complex, intricate, and nonuniform data of modern treatment planning and from multiple vendors in order to easily train ML algorithms. A three-step process utilizing up- and down-sampling and dimension reduction, the method we develop in this paper reduces the thousands of parameters comprising a single treatment plan to a single two-dimensional heat map that is independent of the specific vendor or construction of the machine used for treatment. Our heat-map structure lends itself well to feed well-established ML algorithms, and we train–test random forest, softmax, k-nearest neighbors, shallow neural network, and support vector machine using real clinical treatment plans from several hospitals in the United States. The paper demonstrates that the proposed method characterizes treatment sites so well that ML classifiers may predict head-neck, breast, and prostate treatment sites with an accuracy of about 94%. The proposed method is the first step towards a thorough, fully automated error-checking system in radiation therapy.","Radiation heat map,Nonuniform treatment data,Cancer classification,"
"cellular communications in ocean waves for maritime internet of things","2020","The rapid advancement of Internet of Things (IoT) and fifth generation and beyond technologies is transforming the marine industry and research. Our understanding of the vast sea that covers 71% of the Earth's surface is being enhanced by the various ocean sensor networks equipped with effective communication technologies. In this article, we begin with a review of the research and development status-quo of Maritime IoT (MIoT) enabled by multiple wireless communication technologies. Then, we study the impact of sea waves on radio propagation and the communications link quality. Due to the severe attenuation of sea water to radio-frequency electromagnetic wave propagation, large ocean waves can easily block the communication link between a buoy sensor and a cell tower near shore. This article for the first time uses the ocean wave modeling of coastal and oceanic waters to examine the condition of line-of-sight communications. Real wave measurement data parameters are applied in the numerical evaluation of the developed model.

"influence of climate variability on anchovy reproductive timing off northern chile","2016","We investigated the relationship between environmental variables and the Gonadosomatic Monthly Mean (GMM) index of anchovy (Engraulis ringens) to understand how the environment affects the dynamics of anchovy reproductive timing. The data examined corresponds to biological information collected from samples of the landings off northern Chile (18°21′S, 24°00′S) during the period 1990–2010. We used the Humboldt Current Index (HCI) and the Multivariate ENSO Index (MEI), which combine several physical-oceanographic factors in the Tropical and South Pacific regions. Using the GMM index, we studied the dynamics of anchovy reproductive timing at different intervals of length, specifically females with a length between 11.5 and 14cm (medium class) and longer than 14cm (large class). Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Mobile Average (SARIMA) was used to predict missing observations. The trends of the environment and reproductive indexes were explored via the Breaks For Additive Season and Trend (BFAST) statistical technique and the relationship between these indexes via cross-correlation functions (CCF) analysis. Our results showed that the habitat of anchovy switched from cool to warm condition, which also influenced gonad development. This was revealed by two and three significant changes (breaks) in the trend of the HCI and MEI indexes, and two significant breaks in the GMM of each time series of anchovy females (medium and large). Negative cross-correlation between the MEI index and GMM of medium and large class females was found, indicating that as the environment gets warmer (positive value of MEI) a decrease in the reproductive activity of anchovy can be expected. Correlation between the MEI index and larger females was stronger than with medium females. Additionally, our results indicate that the GMM index of anchovy for both length classes reaches two maximums per year; the first from August to September and the second from December to January. The intensity (maximum GMM values at rise point) of reproductive activity was not equal though, with the August–September peak being the highest. We also discuss how the synchronicity between environment and reproductive timing, the negative correlation found between MEI and GMM indexes, and the two increases per year of anchovy GMM relate to previous studies. Based on these findings we propose ways to advance in the understanding of how anchovy synchronize gonad development with the environment.","Length,Reproduction,Anchovy,Environment,Northern Chile,Humboldt Current System,"
"maritime situation analysis framework: vessel interaction classification and anomaly detection","2015","Maritime domain awareness is critical for protecting sea lanes, ports, harbors, offshore structures like oil and gas rigs and other types of critical infrastructure against common threats and illegal activities. Typical examples range from smuggling of drugs and weapons, human trafficking and piracy all the way to terror attacks. Limited surveillance resources constrain maritime domain awareness and compromise full security coverage at all times. This situation calls for innovative intelligent systems for interactive situation analysis to assist marine authorities and security personal in their routine surveillance operations. In this article, we propose a novel situation analysis approach to analyze marine traffic data and differentiate various scenarios of vessel engagement for the purpose of detecting anomalies of interest for marine vessels that operate over some period of time in relative proximity to each other. We consider such scenarios as probabilistic processes and analyze complex vessel trajectories using machine learning to model common patterns. Specifically, we represent patterns as left-to-right Hidden Markov Models and classify them using Support Vector Machines. To differentiate suspicious activities from unobjectionable behavior, we explore fusion of data and information, including kinematic features, geospatial features, contextual information and maritime domain knowledge.

"holocene surface hydroclimate changes in the indo-pacific warm pool","2018","The Indo-Pacific warm pool (IPWP) is an area hosting key tropical climate processes such as the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD). The tropical climate processes, via various feedback mechanisms, control the surface ocean climate in the Indian Ocean and its surrounding continents on annual to inter-annual timescales. However, little has been known about how the tropical processes are effective forcing climate mechanism over longer timescales. Here we presented a reconstruction of the spatiotemporal pattern of sea surface temperature (SST) with inferred hydroclimate changes since the early Holocene (∼11ka), using proxies of planktonic foraminifer shell Mg/Ca, organic biomarker (TEX86), foraminifer oxygen isotopes, and a terrigenous BIT index measured from a 220 cm long Core BS24 (2.724041°N, 97.010943°E, 1015 m water depth) which was taken offshore of northwest Sumatra in the eastern Indian Ocean. With an age model of 13 AMS 14C dating by the uses of planktonic foraminiferal shells from the core, the TEX86H temperatures of BS24 show as summer-weighted, and reflect integrated thermal effects from the surface to thermocline water, while the Mg/Ca temperature of BS24 better reflects mean annual SST. Our results, along with a regional synthesis of published SST records from the IPWP, suggest that the IPWP has migrated eastwardly since the mid-Holocene (∼5ka). In phase with this eastward migration, the IPWP SSTs have decreased, but the upwelling in the eastern Indian Ocean appears to have been a persistent feature since the mid-Holocene. Our Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis on the compiled IPWP SST records indicates two dominant modes of spatio-temporal variability of surface hydrographes in the IPWP that are attributed to a combined effect of orbital and solar forcing, with expressions analogous to the Indian ocean basin-wide mode (IOBM) and the Indian Ocean dipole model (IOD).","SST,Quaternary,Indo-Pacific warm pool,Mg/Ca,Organic biomarker,TEX,Surface circulation,Monsoon,"
"similarity grouping-guided neural network modeling for maritime time series prediction","2019","Reliable and accurate prediction of time series plays a crucial role in the maritime industry, such as economic investment, transportation planning, port planning, design, and so on. The dynamic growth of maritime time series has the predominantly complex, and nonlinear and non-stationary properties. To guarantee high-quality prediction performance, we propose to first adopt the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and ensemble EMD (EEMD) methods to decompose the original time series into high- and low-frequency components. The low-frequency components can be easily predicted directly through traditional neural network (NN) methods. It is more difficult to predict high-frequency components due to their properties of weak mathematical regularity. To take advantage of the inherent self-similarities within high-frequency components, these components will be divided into several continuous small (overlapping) segments. The grouped segments with high similarities are then selected to form more proper training datasets for traditional NN methods. This regrouping strategy can assist in enhancing the prediction accuracy of high-frequency components. The final prediction result is obtained by integrating the predicted high- and low-frequency components. Our proposed three-step prediction frameworks benefit from the time series decomposition and similar segments grouping. The experiments on both port cargo throughput and vessel traffic flow have illustrated its superior performance in terms of prediction accuracy and robustness.","predicted high- frequency components,Transportation,Data prediction,time series decomposition,high-frequency components,nonstationary properties,Planning,reliable prediction,Predictive models,original time series,dynamic time warping (DTW),neural nets,low-frequency components,high-quality prediction performance,marine engineering,Artificial neural networks,similar segments grouping,Time series analysis,similarity grouping,similarity grouping-guided neural network modeling,three-step prediction frameworks,empirical mode decomposition (EMD),time series,Training,prediction accuracy,NN methods,maritime industry,maritime time series prediction,neural network,neural network methods,EMD methods,"
"a real-time scene parsing network for autonomous maritime transportation","2023","On the sea, scene parsing, one of the most basic environmental perception methods for autonomous tasks, helps autonomous devices safely navigate and avoid obstacles. However, most of the existing methods lack real-time performance and have difficulty accurately detecting small obstacles and changeable textures. We, therefore, propose a real-time scene-parsing network for autonomous maritime transportation. Specifically, we first design a lightweight model framework and then explore three efficient loss functions, such that a balance between accuracy and real-time performance can be achieved. The first loss function is an obstacle-weighted loss, which improves the extraction of small obstacles by analyzing the distribution law of obstacles at sea. The second one is a detail loss, which optimizes the detail segmentation at complex contours by emphasizing edge features. The last one is an affinity loss, utilizing the context dependency between features to accurately detect reflections, ripples, and other changeable textures. In addition, a new maritime sense-parsing dataset called Greater Bay Area (GBA) dataset is proposed and made publicly available. We tested the proposed model on the GBA dataset and MaSTr1325 dataset, and the experimental results show that the proposed method achieves superior performance in both segmentation and speed, with mean intersection over union (mIOU) of 94.59% and an FPS of 39.44.","Decoding,autonomous tasks,autonomous devices,affinity loss,deep learning (artificial intelligence),obstacle-weighted loss,Greater Bay Area (GBA) dataset,real-time,maritime scene parsing,robot vision,marine navigation,Feature extraction,real-time scene-parsing network,Meteorology,basic environmental perception methods,object detection,feature extraction,efficient loss functions,real-time scene parsing network,neural net architecture,maritime sense-parsing dataset,Real-time systems,detail loss,Context prior (CP),obstacle weighted loss,autonomous maritime transportation,Training,loss function,unmanned surface vehicles,mobile robots,real-time performance,Navigation,Task analysis,image segmentation,collision avoidance,changeable textures,"
"joint stochastic prediction of vessel kinematics and destination based on a maritime traffic graph","2022","Maritime traffic increases every year, and therefore also the amount of traffic data from the Automatic Identification System (AIS). Utilizing these data on traffic patterns and possible destinations for long-term vessel prediction is here an important way of gaining maritime situational awareness (MSA) for use in the decision making in autonomous ships, such as collision avoidance algorithms, which can reduce collision risk during voyage. In this article, we present a destination inference method based on piece-wise Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) processes for predicting vessel motions along common traffic lanes toward a set of destinations. The mean velocities of the processes are inferred through the creation of a maritime graph that represents the major traffic patterns in the area of consideration. After using an OU process for prediction along major sea lanes, the Equilibrium Reverting Velocity (ERV) bridging model is used to enable convergence of the prediction towards considered destinations. Then, based on the OU process and ERV bridging model for prediction, Bayesian inference is used to estimate the posterior destination distribution. Tested on a real-time AIS dataset, the method is shown to perform better than current state-of-the art methods in destination inference as it indirectly takes land and passed destinations into account.","Traffic control,mean velocities,Prediction algorithms,vessel kinematics,Bayes methods,equilibrium reverting velocity bridging model,Destination inference,traffic patterns,posterior destination distribution,Stochastic processes,Predictive models,traffic lanes,sea lanes,maritime situational awareness,long-term vessel prediction,piece-wise Ornstein-Uhlenbeck,Mechatronics,ships,marine safety,automatic identification system,marine engineering,stochastic processes,joint stochastic prediction,collision risk,maritime graph,real-time AIS dataset,maritime graphs,traffic data,Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes,vessel motions,maritime traffic graph,decision making,collision avoidance algorithms,Bayesian inference,Real-time systems,graph theory,ERV bridging model,telecommunication traffic,inference mechanisms,traffic engineering computing,Navigation,collision avoidance,OU process,AIS data,destination inference method,autonomous ships,"

The methods examined include statistical and econometric methods, algorithmic approaches, classification and clustering methods, artificial neural networks (ANN) as well as optimization and dimension reduction techniques. Our research reveals the increasing interest of transportation researchers and practitioners in AI applications for crash prediction, incident/failure detection, pattern identification, driver/operator or route assistance, as well as optimization problems. The most popular and efficient methods used in all transport modes are ANN, SVM, Hidden Markov Models and Bayesian models. The type of the analytical technique is mainly driven by the purpose of the safety analysis performed.

Our results suggest that forest fires have been a common disturbance factor in the studied landscape. In total, we dated 62 single fire years, with the mean-point scale fire return interval of 46 years and the length of the fire cycle ranging from 45 to 80 years.

Although both long-term (century and decade-long) and annual dynamics of fire activity in SNP was closely linked to socio-political changes in Latvia, fire activity in SNP was also affected by climate, as indicated by the close positive association of years with increased area burned and positive SST anomalies in the Baltic and North Seas. Future management of SNP should make fire an important element of natural forest dynamics and consider using prescribed fires of various spatial extent and severity.","Fire cycle,Ocean-fire linkages,Forest fires,Dendrochronology,L.,Land use patterns,Hemiboreal,Disturbance regime,Fire reconstruction,"
"the socio-environmental history of the peloponnese during the holocene: towards an integrated understanding of the past","2016","Published archaeological, palaeoenvironmental, and palaeoclimatic data from the Peloponnese in Greece are compiled, discussed and evaluated in order to analyse the interactions between humans and the environment over the last 9000 years. Our study indicates that the number of human settlements found scattered over the peninsula have quadrupled from the prehistoric to historical periods and that this evolution occurred over periods of climate change and seismo–tectonic activity. We show that societal development occurs both during periods of harsh as well as favourable climatic conditions. At some times, some settlements develop while others decline. Well-known climate events such as the 4.2 ka and 3.2 ka events are recognizable in some of the palaeoclimatic records and a regional decline in the number and sizes of settlements occurs roughly at the same time, but their precise chronological fit with the archaeological record remains uncertain. Local socio-political processes were probably always the key drivers behind the diverse strategies that human societies took in times of changing climate. The study thus reveals considerable chronological parallels between societal development and palaeoenvironmental records, but also demonstrates the ambiguities in these correspondences and, in doing so, highlights some of the challenges that will face future interdisciplinary projects. We suggest that there can be no general association made between societal expansion phases and periods of advantageous climate. We also propose that the relevance of climatic and environmental regionality, as well as any potential impacts of seismo-tectonics on societal development, need to be part of the interpretative frameworks.","Archaeology,Palaeoclimate,Human–environment–climate interaction,History,Peloponnese,Greece,Paleoenvironment,"
"dns rebinding threat modeling and security analysis for local area network of maritime transportation systems","2023","Maritime ships and ports have become increasingly digital and intelligent. While intelligent maritime transportation systems bring convenience to the maritime industry, ship operation and management are also confronted with network risks. The Internet of Things (IoT) installed in the shipborne network collects and monitors the environmental data of the whole ship. It uses the collected data to make decisions to control the ship. The threat of Local Area Network (LAN) of IoT in ships has become an emerging issue. The DNS rebinding attack is a typical attack, which can bypass firewalls and seriously threaten the marine network in security and privacy of the local IoT. DNS rebinding attacks are difficult to model and detect, due to their sophisticated characteristics. In this work, we define threat models of DNS rebinding attacks and propose an effective method for the detection of and the defense against these attacks. First, we define threat models for DNS rebinding attacks. We employ a Markov chain to model the process of DNS rebinding attacks. With the threat modeling, the attack behaviors are clearly characterized and the most relevant attributes are thus extracted. Second, we propose an effective method for the detection of DNS rebinding attacks in the marine transportation system. The detection method includes the initialization method and the verification method, which manages and verifies access permission of equipment information and the service interface of the IoT in the shipborn network. Finally, we simulate the DNS rebinding attacks on the marine IoT. We analyze and test the security and the performance of the initialization method and the verification method in the simulated environment. The extensive experimental results demonstrate that the IoT in marine networks is vulnerable to DNS rebinding. Our method is effective and efficient to detect and defend against DNS rebinding attacks. It thus secures security and privacy in the local IoT on shipboard.","Markov processes,threat models,computer network security,DNS rebinding,marine transportation system,IoT,detection method,attack behaviors,Internet of Things,TTL,Marine vehicles,transportation,maritime ships,shipborne network,security of data,marine network,local IoT,network risks,ships,Servers,marine safety,marine engineering,maritime transportation,Local area networks,DNS rebinding attack,typical attack,DNs rebinding threat modeling,Computer crime,shipborn network,verification method,marine IoT,ship operation,intelligent maritime transportation systems,initialization method,Sensors,local area network,maritime industry,Internet,Security,authorisation,data privacy,threat detection,"
"enhancing capacity of maritime broadband communication systems","2016","In this paper we motivate the need for a broadband wireless link over sea. Besides higher data rate, shorter latency and high reliability of the communication link will have a substantial impact on the success of telematic applications. For example hybrid ships need a continuous control of their batteries. Autonomous ships require a ultra-reliable and a high data throughout of the wireless channel to report the relevant telematic information to the off-shore control station. Our analysis investigates the benefits and drawbacks of multiple antenna schemes together with the potential of channel prediction. The outcome shows that the special conditions on sea can be exploited to stabilize the wireless link to increase the reliability.","Broadband communication,Sea measurements,Wireless communication,broadband networks,channel capacity,radio links,off-shore control station,marine communication,multiple antenna schemes,Receivers,maritime broadband communication system capacity enhancement,wireless channel,antenna arrays,wireless channels,Broadband antennas,Delays,telematic applications,broadband wireless link over sea,"
"the international safety framework for nuclear power source applications in outer space—useful and substantial guidance","2015","In 2009, the International Safety Framework for Nuclear Power Source Applications in Outer Space was adopted, following a multi-year process that involved all major space faring nations under the auspices of a partnership between the UN Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space and the International Atomic Energy Agency. The Safety Framework reflects an international consensus on best practices to achieve safety. Following the 1992 UN Principles Relevant to the Use of Nuclear Power Sources in Outer Space, it is the second attempt by the international community to draft guidance promoting the safety of applications of nuclear power sources in space missions. NPS applications in space have unique safety considerations compared with terrestrial applications. Mission launch and outer space operational requirements impose size, mass and other space environment limitations not present for many terrestrial nuclear facilities. Potential accident conditions could expose nuclear power sources to extreme physical conditions. The Safety Framework is structured to provide guidance for both the programmatic and technical aspects of safety. In addition to sections containing specific guidance for governments and for management, it contains technical guidance pertinent to the design, development and all mission phases of space NPS applications. All sections of the Safety Framework contain elements directly relevant to engineers and space mission designers for missions involving space nuclear power sources. The challenge for organisations and engineers involved in the design and development processes of space nuclear power sources and applications is to implement the guidance provided in the Safety Framework by integrating it into the existing standard space mission infrastructure of design, development and operational requirements, practices and processes. This adds complexity to the standard space mission and launch approval processes. The Safety Framework is deliberately generic to remain relevantly independent of technological progress, of national organisational setups and of space mission types. Implementing its guidance therefore leaves room for interpretation and adaptation. Relying on reported practices, we analyse the guidance particularly relevant to engineers and space mission designers.","Nuclear power sources,COPUOS,Safety,STSC,Safety framework,"
"b-cell depletion immunotherapy in pemphigus: effects on cellular and humoral immune responses","2008","Pemphigus are B-cell-mediated autoimmune diseases affecting skin and mucous membranes. They are characterized by the production of pathogenic autoantibodies directed against desmogleins (Dsg). In this prospective study, we treated 21 pemphigus patients with rituximab and analyzed immunological modifications induced by anti-CD20 immunotherapy. The total depletion of peripheral B cells led to a significant decrease of total serum IgM but not IgG levels. The B-cell depletion was followed by a progressive re-emergence of naive blood B lymphocytes, with one-third of them expressing a transitional CD19+CD38highCD24high phenotype. In most patients, clinical response to rituximab was closely related to the evolution of anti-Dsg autoantibodies that decreased in patients who achieved complete remission, whereas they remained unchanged or reincreased in relapsing patients. In contrast, serum antimicrobial IgG remained stable after rituximab treatment. B-cell repertoire analysis of three patients using immunoscope showed distortions of VH-IgM and VH-IgG immunoscope profiles before treatment, particularly clonal and oligoclonal expansions in some VH families, which were not found after B-cell reconstitution, following anti-CD20 immunotherapy. The depletion of autoreactive B cells leading to the elimination of anti-Dsg autoantibodies in most remitted patients and the restoration of a diverse B-cell repertoire by naive B lymphocytes may provide an explanation for the long-lasting efficacy of rituximab in pemphigus patients.

"seamless and energy-efficient maritime coverage in coordinated 6g spaceâ€“airâ€“sea non-terrestrial networks","2023","Non-terrestrial networks (NTNs), which integrate space and aerial networks with terrestrial systems, are a key area in the emerging sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks. As part of 6G, NTNs must provide pervasive connectivity to a wide range of devices, including smartphones, vehicles, sensors, robots, and maritime users. However, due to the high mobility and deployment of NTNs, managing the space-airâ€“sea (SAS) NTN resources, i.e., energy, power, and channel allocation, is a major challenge. The design of an SAS-NTN for energy-efficient resource allocation is investigated in this study. The goal is to maximize system energy efficiency (EE) by collaboratively optimizing user equipment (UE) association, power control, and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) deployment. Given the limited payloads of UAVs, this work focuses on minimizing the total energy cost of UAVs (trajectory and transmission) while meeting EE requirements. A mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem is proposed, followed by the development of an algorithm to decompose, and solve each problem distributedly. The binary (UE association) and continuous (power, deployment) variables are separated using the Bender decomposition (BD), and then the Dinkelbach algorithm (DA) is used to convert fractional programming into an equivalent solvable form in the subproblem. A standard optimization solver is utilized to deal with the complexity of the master problem for binary variables. The alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm is used to solve the subproblem for the continuous variables. Our proposed algorithm provides a suboptimal solution, and simulation results demonstrate that the algorithm achieves better EE and spectral efficiency (SE) than baselines.","Satellites,telecommunication power management,channel allocation,binary variables,coordinated 6G,telecommunication computing,total energy cost,convex programming,energy-efficient resource allocation,sixth-generation (6G) networking,integer programming,Resource management,multipliers algorithm,Alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM),concave programming,terrestrial systems,space-air-sea NTN resources,5G mobile communication,spectral efficiency,continuous variables,unmanned aerial vehicle deployment,energy-efficient maritime coverage,optimisation,high mobility,Low earth orbit satellites,nonterrestrial networks,satellite-access networks,Dinkelbach algorithm (DA),key area,6G mobile communication,mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem,Synthetic aperture sonar,master problem,NTNs,spaceâ€“airâ€“sea (SAS) communication,Satellite constellations,Satellite broadcasting,autonomous aerial vehicles,aerial networks,nonlinear programming,power control,Bender decomposition (BD),maritime users,pervasive connectivity,standard optimization solver,system energy efficiency,marine communication,energy conservation,emerging sixth-generation wireless networks,Dinkelbach algorithm,seamless,UE association,user equipment association,resource allocation,Backhaul networks,unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV),UAV,"
"practical multichannel sar imaging in the maritime environment","2018","The U.S. Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) recently developed an X-band airborne multichannel synthetic aperture radar (MSAR) test bed system that consists of 32 along-track phase centers. This system was deployed in September 2014 and again in October 2015 to perform extensive and systematic data collections on a variety of land and maritime scenes under different environmental conditions. This paper presents a detailed experimental analysis of imaging in the maritime domain using data captured by the NRL MSAR system. After presenting some of the important details of our NRL MSAR system, we demonstrate velocity-based imaging of a variety of moving backscatter sources including ships and shoaling ocean waves. Our analysis is based on the velocity SAR (VSAR) technique, which was originally conceived by Friedlander and Porat. Practical application of this algorithm in the maritime domain requires a number of pre- and postprocessing stages, which are described here in detail. Our results are then benchmarked against the traditional along-track interferometry, where it is demonstrated that VSAR processing is better able to correctly compensate motion-induced distortion.","marine radar,Radar antennas,Distortion,sea surface,image enhancement,X-band airborne multichannel synthetic aperture radar test bed system,Synthetic aperture radar,velocity SAR technique,ocean waves,ships,NRL MSAR system,synthetic aperture radar,practical multichannel SAR imaging,microwave antenna arrays,radar imaging,maritime scenes,maritime environment,Image resolution,Radar imaging,U.S. Naval Research Laboratory,Imaging,Image motion analysis,"

"anomalously severe cold nights and warm days in northeastern spain: their spatial variability, driving forces and future projections","2013","Spatial and temporal variability of the most extreme temperatures during extended winter (November–February, NDJF) and summer (May–August, MJJA) have been analyzed over northeast Spain. This work employed a high-quality daily temperature dataset of 128 station records spanning the period from 1959 to 2006. The uppermost (99th) percentile of daily maximum temperature distribution was used to define very warm days (hereafter VWD), while the lowermost (1st) percentile of daily minimum temperature distribution was adopted to identify very cold nights (hereafter VCN). The climatological conditions related to the initialization and persistence of these rare events were also examined. Based on daily Sea Level Pressure (SLP) and 200hPa and 500hPa geopotential height fields from the NCEP/NCAR re-analyses, major large-scale circulation patterns corresponding to these events over large domain of the North Atlantic and European regions were used in order to explore their interrelations with anomalous temperature in the study domain. Our results demonstrate that the occurrence of VCN was mainly associated to the dominance of cyclonic (anticyclonic) conditions over southern Europe and the Mediterranean (Scandinavia). This situation corresponded to an increase in the meridional circulation over much area of Western Europe, with strong advection of colder air from northern continental Europe and the north Atlantic to the study domain. For VWD, the most likely factors contributing to the frequency of these events were the north-eastward displacement of the Atlantic subtropical high and the increase in the European blockings. Based on data derived from a suite of regional climate models (RCMs) with the best validation results, future projections of the frequency and intensity of VWD and VCN events were also assessed under the A1B greenhouse gas emission scenario. Our results demonstrate that future VWD extremes could become more frequent and severe during the latter decades of the 21st century, while a number of simulations projected a general tendency for fewer VCN extremes. Over the study domain climate models predict even faster warming rates for the continental areas relative to coastal portions, which clearly comes in contrast with the observed climatology.","daily temperature,northeast Spain,atmospheric circulation,extremes,regional climate models,geopotential fields,"
"data-driven fraud detection in international shipping","2018","Document fraud constitutes a growing problem in international shipping. Shipping documentation may be deliberately manipulated to avoid shipping restrictions or customs duties. Well-known examples of such fraud are miscoding and smuggling. These are cases in which the documentation of a shipment does not correctly or entirely describe the goods in transit. In an attempt to reduce the risks of document fraud, shipping companies and customs authorities typically perform random audits to check the accompanying documentation of shipments. Although these audits detect many fraud schemes, they are quite labor intensive and do not scale to the massive amounts of cargo that is shipped each day. This paper investigates whether intelligent fraud detection systems can improve the detection of miscoding and smuggling by analyzing large sets of historical shipment data. We develop a Bayesian network that predicts the presence of goods on the cargo list of shipments. The predictions of the Bayesian network are compared with the accompanying documentation of a shipment to determine whether document fraud is perpetrated. We also show how a set of discriminative models can be derived from the topology of the Bayesian network and perform the same fraud detection task. Our experimental results show that intelligent fraud detection systems can considerably improve the detection of miscoding and smuggling compared to random audits.","Neural networks,International shipping,Fraud detection,Logistic regression,Bayesian networks,Probablistic classification,"
"an evaluation of volcanic cloud detection techniques during recent significant eruptions in the western ‘ring of fire’","2004","We examined recent volcanic cloud events in the Western Pacific and Indonesian area, to validate the performance of remote sensing techniques used to support the International Airways Volcano Watch (IAVW). Five events were considered, during which eruptions from eight volcanoes injected ash into the upper troposphere or lower stratosphere. For one of the eruptions, at Miyakejima, Japan, at least five aircraft encountered volcanic ash clouds, and the cost to three operators alone exceeded US $12,000,000 in aircraft repairs, diversions, and lost operating time. We performed ‘reverse’ absorption and ‘pattern analysis’ using GMS-5/VISSR, MODIS and AVHRR data, and we examined TOMS SO2 and Aerosol Index data, surface-based observations, pilot reports, and dispersion model output. Our results verify that the introduction of ‘reverse’ absorption using the geostationary GMS-5 platform significantly enhanced our capacity to monitor volcanic ash clouds in the region. In one case, we tracked an eruption cloud for approximately 80 h. The primary impediment to remote monitoring is the presence of overlying cloud, or substantial amounts of ice within the volcanic clouds. TOMS data showed success in identifying volcanic clouds during these conditions, but was limited by the infrequency of observations. More effective future operation of the IAVW relies on developing complementary methods of volcanic cloud remote sensing, and greatly increasing the amount and quality of available surface and air observations, including observations of precursor activity. An understanding of the likely future limitations of remote sensing techniques will aid in the refining of IAVW procedures.","Volcanic eruptions,Satellite remote sensing,Aviation safety,Volcanic ash detection,"
"spatio-temporal detection for dengue outbreaks in the central region of malaysia using climatic drivers at mesoscale and synoptic scale","2022","The disease dengue is associated with both mesoscale and synoptic scale meteorology. However, previous studies for south-east Asia have found a very limited association between synoptic variables and the reported number of dengue cases. Hence there is an urgent need to establish a more clear association with dengue incidence rates and the most relevant meteorological variables in order to institute an early warning system. This article develops a rigorous Bayesian modelling framework to identify the most important covariates and their lagged effects for constructing an early warning system for the Central Region of Malaysia where the case rates have increased substantially in the recent past. Our modelling includes multiple synoptic scale Niño indices, which are related to the phenomenon of El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), along with other relevant mesoscale environmental measurements and an unobserved variable derived from reanalysis data. An empirically well validated hierarchical Bayesian spatio-temporal is used to build a probabilistic early warning system for detecting an upcoming dengue epidemic. Our study finds a 46.87% increase in dengue cases due to one degree increase in the central equatorial Pacific sea surface temperature with a lag time of six weeks. We discover the existence of a mild association with relative risk 0.9774 (CI: 0.9602, 0.9947) between the rate of cases and a distant lagged cooling effect in the region of coastal South America related to a phenomenon called El Niño Modoki. The Bayesian model also establishes that the synoptic meteorological drivers can enhance short-term early detection of dengue outbreaks and these can also potentially be used to provide longer-term forecasts.","early warning system,ENSO,dengue,Bayesian spatio-temporal model,El Niño Modoki,BYM2,"
"sponges as libraries: increase in microplastics in cinachyrella alloclada after 36 years","2022","Many studies investigated the presence and effects of microplastics in marine species, but data about sponges are still incipient. We quantified these pollutants in a population of the tropical sponge Cinachyrella alloclada, comparing museum specimens sampled in 1981 with specimens sampled in 2017. The mean number of microplastics in specimens collected decades ago was one order of magnitude lower (0.13 ± 0.40/g of sponge tissue) than those sampled more recently (1.37 ± 0.94/g). We observed microplastics in only 10 % of the specimens collected in 1981 but in 80 % of those from 2017. According to Raman spectroscopy, fibers in C. alloclada consisted of polypropylene.

"real-time event-based tracking and detection for maritime environments","2021","Event cameras are ideal for object tracking applications due to their ability to capture fast-moving objects while mitigating latency and data redundancy. Existing event-based clustering and feature tracking approaches for surveillance and object detection work well in the majority of cases, but fall short in a maritime environment. Our application of maritime vessel detection and tracking requires a process that can identify features and output a confidence score representing the likelihood that the feature was produced by a vessel, which may trigger a subsequent alert or activate a classification system. However, the maritime environment presents unique challenges such as the tendency of waves to produce the majority of events, demanding the majority of computational processing and producing false positive detections. By filtering redundant events and analyzing the movement of each event cluster, we can identify and track vessels while ignoring shorter lived and erratic features such as those produced by waves.","surveillance,subsequent alert classification system,image motion analysis,Feature extraction,maritime vessel detection,redundant events,Filtering,activate a classification system,object tracking,data redundancy,false positive detections,real-time systems,event-based clustering,Hardware,cameras,object detection,computational processing,event cameras,image classification,pattern clustering,Real-time systems,marine engineering computing,Redundancy,maritime environment,Object detection,Surveillance,time event-based tracking,object tracking applications,event cluster,"
"deeptracks: geopositioning maritime vehicles in video acquired from a moving platform","2021","Geopositioning and tracking a moving boat at sea is a very challenging problem, requiring boat detection, matching and estimating its GPS location from imagery with no common features. The problem can be stated as follows: given imagery from a camera mounted on a moving platform with known GPS location as the only valid sensor, we predict the geoposition of a target boat visible in images. Our solution uses recent ML algorithms, the camera-scene geometry and Bayesian filtering. The proposed pipeline first detects and tracks the target boatâ€™s location in the image with the strategy of tracking by detection. This image location is then converted to geoposition to the local sea coordinates referenced to the camera GPS location using plane projective geometry. Finally, target boat local coordinates are transformed to global GPS coordinates to estimate the geoposition. To achieve a smooth geotrajectory, we apply unscented Kalman filter (UKF) which implicitly overcomes small detection errors in the early stages of the pipeline. We tested the performance of our approach using GPS ground truth and show the accuracy and speed of the estimated geopositions.

"detecting anomalous deviations from standard maritime routes using the ornsteinâ€“uhlenbeck process","2018","A novel anomaly detection procedure based on the Ornsteinâ€“Uhlenbeck (OU) mean-reverting stochastic process is presented. The considered anomaly is a vessel that deviates from a planned route, changing its nominal velocity $\boldsymbol{v}_0$. In order to hide this behavior, the vessel switches off its automatic identification system (AIS) device for a time  $T$ and then tries to revert to the previous nominal velocity $\boldsymbol{v}_0$. The decision that has to be made is declaring that a deviation either happened or not, relying only upon two consecutive AIS contacts. Furthermore, the extension to the scenario in which multiple contacts (e.g., radar) are available during the time period $T$ is also considered. A proper statistical hypothesis testing procedure that builds on the changes in the OU process long-term velocity parameter $\boldsymbol{v}_0$ of the vessel is the core of the proposed approach and enables the solution of the anomaly detection problem.

"long-term observation of global nuclear power plants thermal plumes using landsat images and deep learning","2023","Thermal discharge from nuclear power plants poses a threat to the received natural water bodies, but the long-term extent and intensity of their surface thermal plumes remain unclear. In this study, we proposed a method to determine the background area for each drainage outlet and delineate the mixed surface thermal plumes based on 7,172 Landsat thermal infrared images. We further used a deep convolutional neural network integrated with prior location knowledge to extract core surface thermal plumes for 74 drainage outlets of 66 nuclear power plants worldwide. Our final model achieved a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 0.8998 and an F1 score of 0.8886. We found that the mean maximal water surface temperature (WST) increment of the studied plants globally was 4.80 K. The Tianwan plant in China experienced the highest WST increase (8.51 K), followed by the Gravelines plant in France and the Ohi plant in Japan (7.91 K and 7.71 K, respectively). The Bruce plant in Canada had the largest thermal-polluted surface area (7.22 km2). We also provided the dataset, Global Coastal Nuclear power plant Thermal Plume (GCNT-Plume), to describe the long-term occurrence of water surface thermal plumes. Three influencing factors of the water surface thermal plume were further analyzed in this study, including total capacity, drainage type, and location type, which were associated with operating power, drainage method, and geographical features, respectively. Total capacity was more statistically related to the maximum of WST increment under shallow drainage condition. The mean WST increment of shallow drainage was 1.22 K higher than that of deep drainage. Surface plumes larger than 4 km2 frequently occurred in the Great Lakes, while small surface thermal plumes (< 1 km2) were primarily found in estuaries. The proposed method provides an important framework for future operational water surface thermal plume detection using remotely sensed observations and deep learning.","Landsat,WST,Surface thermal plume,Deep learning,Thermal infrared remote sensing,Nuclear power plants,"

"identifying industrial heat sources using time-series of the viirs nightfire product with an object-oriented approach","2018","Carbon-based fuels burned at industrial facilities account for a large proportion of greenhouse gas emissions, and an up-to-date spatiotemporally detailed inventory is essential for a better understanding of global carbon emission patterns. The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Nightfire product offers a quantitative estimation of the temperatures of sub-pixel heat sources, providing the potential for detecting thermal anomalies from industrial sectors across the globe. However, identifying subcategories of various industrial heat sources is challenging because there are scarcely any stable and typical characteristics for their classification at a single thermal anomaly scale. Specifically, these nighttime thermal anomalies exhibit a strong spatiotemporal heterogeneity (e.g., fluctuations in retrieved temperature, spatial shifts in position, and presence of false positives), even in industrial heat sources that do not vary through time. Here, we demonstrate an object-oriented approach to robustly segment and accurately classify various industrial heat sources from a time-series of the VIIRS Nightfire product. The approach operates from the cluster level of spatially adjacent nighttime thermal anomalies (i.e., nighttime-heat-source objects rather than individual thermal anomalies) to generate fingerprint-like characteristics and to address the challenge of spatiotemporal heterogeneity. Specifically, the spatial-aggregation characteristic of nighttime thermal anomalies from continuously operating industrial heat sources and the temporal-aggregation characteristics of biomass burnings were incorporated to differentiate industrial nighttime-heat-source objects from ubiquitous biomass burnings. Subsequently, the similarity of the thermal signals of nighttime thermal anomalies from identical industrial heat sources was used to generate highly recognizable characteristics for their identification. A spatiotemporally detailed inventory of industrial heat sources across the globe was then established from this object-oriented classification. The inventory included a total of 15,199 industrial heat sources, representing 49.52% of all higher confidence nighttime thermal anomalies in the VIIRS Nightfire product. Validation of the results showed that only 218 objects (1.43%) were biomass burnings or active volcanoes that were misclassified as industrial heat sources. Further validation of sub-categories indicated an overall classification accuracy of ~77%. Our findings suggest that the VIIRS Nightfire product has great potential for monitoring the global distribution and dynamics of industrial heat sources, and combined with the object-oriented approach developed here the methodology is simple, robust, and cost-effective.","Nightfire product,Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS),Object-oriented analysis,Identification,Industrial heat sources,Time-series,"
"multi-hop wireless transmission for maritime scenarios","2023","The collection and processing of maritime information is an essential task that demands extensive analysis to achieve a more profound understanding of coastal regions. Usually, data is gathered through sensors placed on buoys and transmitted to onshore data centres for storage and examination. Nevertheless, the harsh marine environment, including waves, wind, and vessel traffic, creates substantial challenges for effectively managing this task. This paper focuses on two key objectives: firstly, introducing a physical model for electromagnetic propagation in a buoy network that takes into account the unique characteristics of the marine environment, and secondly, evaluating the performance of the physical model in a multi-hop data transmission scenario using a LoRaWAN mesh network. The main aim of the proposed approach is to facilitate efficient communication while optimising the utilisation of reconfigurable devices to reduce power consumption and accelerate data transmission. To gauge the effectiveness of the proposed solution, we explored a multi-hop approach centred on a single relay node that receives packets from other nodes and forwards them to the gateway. We analyse two quality-of-service parameters: throughput and packet losses. Our proposed solution indicates that employing a straightforward one-hop relay can enhance throughput up to three times during the transmission process.","onshore data centres,multihop wireless transmission,key objectives,Throughput,buoy network,physical model,Wireless sensor networks,one-hop relay,Sea measurements,Wireless communication,vessel traffic,maritime scenarios,multihop data transmission scenario,mesh network,transmission process,LoRaWAN,wireless sensor networks,electromagnetic propagation,Data models,simulation,LoRaWAN mesh network,multi-hop,Spread spectrum communication,substantial challenges,harsh marine environment,demands extensive analysis,maritime information,coastal regions,profound understanding,Sensors,multihop approach,buoys,wide area networks,Marine of Things (MoT),power consumption,"
"enhanced monitoring of life in the sea is a critical component of conservation management and sustainable economic growth","2021","Marine biodiversity is a fundamental characteristic of our planet that depends on and influences climate, water quality, and many ocean state variables. It is also at the core of ecosystem services that can make or break economic development in any region. Our purpose is to highlight the need for marine biological observations to inform science and conservation management and to support the blue economy. We provide ten recommendations, applicable now, to measure and forecast biological Essential Ocean Variables (EOVs) as part of economic monitoring efforts. The UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development (2021–2030) provides a timely opportunity to implement these recommendations to benefit humanity and enable the USD 3 trillion global ocean economy expected by 2030.","Ecological forecasting,Blue economy,Marine biological data,Sustainable,Biodiversity,Essential ocean variables,"
"predicting spatial kelp abundance in shallow coastal waters using the acoustic ground discrimination system roxann","2014","Kelp forests represent a major habitat type in coastal waters worldwide and their structure and distribution is predicted to change due to global warming. Despite their ecological and economical importance, there is still a lack of reliable spatial information on their abundance and distribution. In recent years, various hydroacoustic mapping techniques for sublittoral environments evolved. However, in turbid coastal waters, such as off the island of Helgoland (Germany, North Sea), the kelp vegetation is present in shallow water depths normally excluded from hydroacoustic surveys. In this study, single beam survey data consisting of the two seafloor parameters roughness and hardness were obtained with RoxAnn from water depth between 2 and 18 m. Our primary aim was to reliably detect the kelp forest habitat with different densities and distinguish it from other vegetated zones. Five habitat classes were identified using underwater-video and were applied for classification of acoustic signatures. Subsequently, spatial prediction maps were produced via two classification approaches: Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and manual classification routine (MC). LDA was able to distinguish dense kelp forest from other habitats (i.e. mixed seaweed vegetation, sand, and barren bedrock), but no variances in kelp density. In contrast, MC also provided information on medium dense kelp distribution which is characterized by intermediate roughness and hardness values evoked by reduced kelp abundances. The prediction maps reach accordance levels of 62% (LDA) and 68% (MC). The presence of vegetation (kelp and mixed seaweed vegetation) was determined with higher prediction abilities of 75% (LDA) and 76% (MC). Since the different habitat classes reveal acoustic signatures that strongly overlap, the manual classification method was more appropriate for separating different kelp forest densities and low-lying vegetation. It became evident that the occurrence of kelp in this area is not simply linked to water depth. Moreover, this study shows that the two seafloor parameters collected with RoxAnn are suitable indicators for the discrimination of different densely vegetated seafloor habitats in shallow environments.","seafloor mapping,underwater habitats,macroalgae forests,hydroacoustics,Helgoland,"
"anomaly detection of markov processes with evolution equation and moments⁎⁎this work was supported in part by poul due jensen foundation.","2020","Our departure point is the evolution equation of a Markov process. It describes the changes in the transition probability as time passes. We compare the transition probability for a priori model with the actual transition probability of the observed process to detect a mismatch between the expected and the measured data. To translate this idea into an algorithm, we characterise the involved measures by their moments. Specifically, a linear dynamic system is put forward that describes the evolution of moments. As the last result, we define a moment divergence as the means of computing the distance between two sequences of moments. We see the work as a step towards merging model-driven and data-driven concepts in control engineering. To elucidate the concepts introduced, we have incorporated several simple examples.",""
"experimental measurements of propagation characteristics for maritime radio links","2009","This paper presents studies, carried out by TeÂ¿leÂ¿com Bretagne, concerning new radio technologies (mainly WiMAX, 802.16e) in the maritime environment. The aim of these studies is to reinforce the quality and the robustness of such transmissions. Several measurements were set up to characterize the propagation channel in maritime environment in order to study the communication performances of WiMAX. This characterization was obtained by specific experimental devices, developed and implemented by TeÂ¿leÂ¿com Bretagne. The experimentations were carried out at frequencies of 3.5 GHz (Licensed WiMAX Band in France) and 5.8 GHz (Free Band in France). Similar studies and were already carried out, but they did not take into account all the environment characteristics, namely tides and coast relief masking. Our study looks at these parameters for a better understanding of the propagation in operational transmission environments. In this paper, measurements were carried out by measuring the mean received power both for several distances over the sea and for a coastal point-to-point link during long periods.

"seaweed and climate change: a mapping review","2023","Seaweed has garnered increasing interest due to its capacity to mitigate climate change by curbing carbon emissions from agriculture, as well as its potential to serve as a supplement or alternative for dietary, livestock feed, or fuel source production. Moreover, seaweed is regarded as one of the earliest plant forms to have evolved on Earth. Owing to the extensive body of literature available and the uncertainty surrounding the future trajectory of seaweed research under evolving climate conditions, this review scrutinizes the structure, dynamics, and progression of the literature pertaining to seaweed and climate change. This analysis is grounded in the Web of Science Core Collection database, augmented by CiteSpace software. Furthermore, we discuss the productivity and influence of individual researchers, research organizations, countries, and scientific journals. To date, there have been 8047 articles published globally (after a series of filters and exclusions), with a notable upswing in publication frequency since 2018. The USA, China, and Australia are among the leading countries contributing to this research area. Our findings reveal that current research on seaweed and climate change encompasses 13 distinct research clusters, including “marine heatwave”, “temperate estuary”, “ocean acidification”, and “macroalgal bloom”. The most frequently cited keywords are “climate change”, “biomass”, “community”, and “photosynthesis”. The seaweed species most commonly referenced in relation to climate change include Gracilaria sp., Sargassum sp., Ecklonia maxima, and Macrocystis pyrifera. These results provide valuable guidance for shaping the direction of specialized topics concerning marine biodiversity under shifting climate conditions. We propose that seaweed production may be compromised during prolonged episodes of reduced water availability, emphasizing the need to formulate strategies to guarantee its continued viability. This article offers fresh perspectives on the analysis of seaweed research in the context of impending climate change.","Photosynthesis,Phytoplankton,Eutrophication,"
"forecasting the impact of an 1859-calibre superstorm on satellite resources","2006","We have developed simple models to assess the economic impacts to the current satellite resource caused by the worst-case scenario of a hypothetical superstorm event occurring during the next sunspot cycle. Although the consequences may be severe, our worse-case scenario does not include the complete failure of the entire 937 operating satellites in the current population, which have a replacement value of ∼$170–230 billion, and supporting a ∼$90 billion/year industry. Our estimates suggest a potential economic loss of <$70 billion for lost revenue (∼$44 billion) and satellite replacement for GEO satellites (∼$24 billion) caused by a ‘once a century’ single storm similar to the 1859 superstorm. We estimate that 80 satellites (LEO, MEO, and GEO) may be disabled as a consequence of a superstorm event. Additional impacts may include the failure of many of the GPS, GLONASS, and Galileo satellite systems in MEO. Approximately 97 LEO satellites, which normally would not have re-entered for many decades, may prematurely de-orbit by ca 2021 as a result of the temporarily increased atmospheric drag caused by a superstorm event occurring in ca. 2012. The $100 billion International Space Station may lose significant altitude, placing it in critical need for re-boosting by an amount potentially outside the range of typical Space Shuttle operations, which are in any case scheduled to end in 2010. Currently, the ability to forecast extreme particle events and coronal mass ejections, or predict their fluences and geoseverity in the 24-h prior to the event, appears to be no better than 50/50. Our analysis of economic impacts is a first attempt at estimation whose approach will suggest ways in which better estimates may eventually be obtained.","Satellite anomalies,Radiation sickness,Technology impacts,Satellite failures,Space weather,Superstorms,Economic impacts,"
"the impact of humidity on australia’s operational heatwave services","2022","More frequent and intense heatwaves in the last decade have challenged humanitarian, health and meteorological authorities to mitigate impact. Meteorological heatwave monitoring and prediction services vary between heatwave definitions which either include humidity or are based only on temperature. Incorporation of humidity into human health heatwave studies and warning services has been variable. Whilst higher humidity is a known stressor during heatwaves, humidity is known to confound interpretation of heatwave data and can be difficult to monitor and forecast. This study examines the effect of humidity on diagnosed heatwave severity across Australia’s diverse climate zones. Dry bulb temperature is used as the only input into the Bureau of Meteorology’s current operational Excess Heat Factor (EHF) index. Alternative humidity-affected temperature indices (Apparent Temperature, Wet Bulb Globe Temperature and Heat Index) are examined for suitability as input to EHF to compare the incidence of dry and humidity-affected heatwave severity within Australia. This paper uses maximum and minimum dry and humidity affected temperature indices extracted from Australia’s Bureau of Meteorology Atmospheric high-resolution Regional Reanalysis for Australia (BARRA). Our investigation demonstrates Australia’s operational temperature-only percentile-based heatwave severity service provides effective heatwave warning guidance for five of Australia’s six diverse climate zones. However, rare very dry or very humid heatwaves in the tropics require both dry bulb temperature-only and Heat Index versions of Excess Heat Factor (EHF) severity index to provide competent operational heatwave early warning guidance.","Tropical heatwaves,Heatwave severity,Heatwave warnings,Very dry heatwaves,Excess Heat Factor,Very humid heatwaves,"
"from unsupervised to semi-supervised anomaly detection methods for hrrp targets","2020","Responding to the challenge of detecting unusual radar targets in a well identified environment, innovative anomaly and novelty detection methods keep emerging in the literature. This work aims at presenting a benchmark gathering common and recently introduced unsupervised anomaly detection (AD) methods, the results being generated using high-resolution range profiles. A semi-supervised AD (SAD) is considered to demonstrate the added value of having a few labeled anomalies to improve performances. Experiments were conducted with and without pollution of the training set with anomalous samples in order to be as close as possible to real operational contexts. The common AD methods composing our baseline will be One-Class Support Vector Machines (OC-SVM), Isolation Forest (IF), Local Outlier Factor (LOF) and a Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE). The more innovative AD methods put forward by this work are Deep Support Vector Data Description (Deep SVDD) and Random Projection Depth (RPD), belonging respectively to deep and shallow AD. The semi-supervised adaptation of Deep SVDD constitutes our SAD method. HRRP data was generated by a coastal surveillance radar, our results thus suggest that AD can contribute to enhance maritime and coastal situation awareness.","semisupervised anomaly detection methods,Pollution,unusual radar targets,benchmark gathering,Support vector machines,Anomaly detection,radar detection,HRRP targets,anomaly detection,unsupervised learning,high-resolution range profiles,Neural networks,semisupervised adaptation,novelty detection methods,radar target detection,radar computing,innovative anomaly,support vector machines,SAD method,machine learning,object detection,radar target recognition,innovative AD methods,search radar,identified environment,Deep SVDD,high-resolution range profile,Radar,common AD methods,convolutional neural nets,labeled anomalies,Training,One-Class Support Vector Machines,neural network,semisupervised AD,Radar detection,"
"high discharge intensified low net ecosystem productivity, hypoxia, and acidification at three outlets of the pearl river estuary, china","2022","Clarifying the influence of hydrological variations on ecological function is a topic of considerable interest in watershed ecological flow assessment and water resource management. Net ecosystem productivity (NEP) is a useful composite indicator of ecosystem function, reflecting material cycling and energy flow. However, the effects of hydrological variations on NEP, especially the influence mechanism, remain unclear due to the complex environmental characteristics in estuaries. We analysed the spatial–temporal variability of the aquatic environment and NEP through in-situ monitoring and field sampling from December 2018 to January 2020 at three outlets (Humen, Jiaomen, and Hongqimen) with different hydrological conditions in the Pearl River Estuary (PRE), China, and explored the influence mechanism of hydrological variation on NEP. The 155 groups of effective metabolism values were estimated using Odum's open-water method. The daily ecosystem respiration (ER) was higher than the gross primary production (GPP); therefore, water bodies were dominated by net heterotrophy at the three outlets. The daily NEP (–4.34 ± 1.40 mg O2 L–1d–1), O2 concentration (5.2 ± 1.02 mg L–1), and pH (7.53±0.24) were lowest at Humen, which also had the largest discharge and tide volume, deepest water depth, and widest channel. Seasonally, the NEP in the summer (–3.30 ± 1.39 mg O2 L–1d–1) and autumn (–3.19 ± 1.60 mg O2 L–1d–1) was lower than those in the spring (–1.56 ± 1.92 mg O2 L–1d–1) and winter (–2.17 ± 1.50 mg O2 L–1d–1). The inhibitory effect of increased discharge on the metabolic rate exceeded the stimulation provided by seasonal factors, such as increased temperature and solar radiation. The scour and dilution effect caused by discharge increase reduced chlorophyll a concentration; meanwhile, the increase in turbidity resulted in a decrease in the photosynthetic rate and GPP. ER was stimulated by heterotrophic microorganisms and high total suspended solids, resulting in a decrease in O2 and endogenous organics, thus causing the low NEP, hypoxia, and acidification phenomenon. Our results suggest that lengthening the discharge pulse period in summer and autumn will further decrease NEP and increase the area of hypoxia and acidification at the three outlets in the PRE.","Influence mechanism,Aquatic metabolism,Net ecosystem productivity,Hydrological condition,Subtropical estuary,"

In this paper, we demonstrate the potential of using blockchain to facilitate privacy-preserving data sharing.

"north atlantic forcing of millennial-scale indo-australian monsoon dynamics during the last glacial period","2013","Recent studies of the Last Glacial period Indo-Australian summer monsoon (IASM) have revealed links to both northern and southern hemisphere high latitude climate as well as to regional ocean conditions. Particular interest has been paid to the monsoon response to Heinrich events, with variability explained by meridional shifts in positioning of the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ), but this model has not been adequately tested. In addition, the shorter-lived Dansgaard/Oeschger (D/O) events have not been detected (beyond D/O-1, the Bølling/Allerød) in land-based records from the Indo-Pacific, despite their prominent expression in stalagmites from southern Asia, raising questions about the sensitivity of the IASM to these events. Here we present a Southern Hemisphere stalagmite oxygen isotopic time series from Ball Gown Cave (BGC), tropical northern Australia, located on the margins of the modern austral summer ITCZ, that spans 40–31 and 27–8 ka. Elevated IASM rainfall coincides with Heinrich stadials and the Younger Dryas, while decreased rainfall characterizes D/O interstadials, a response that is anti-phased with sites spanning the Indo-Pacific Warm Pool and with Chinese records of the East Asian summer monsoon. The BGC time series thus reveals a precipitation dipole consistent with a southward (northward) migration of the ITCZ during periods of high northern latitude cooling (warming) as the primary driver of millennial-scale IASM variability during the Last Glacial period. Our record indicates a strengthening of the IASM after the Younger Dryas period, likely as a result of rising sea level and sea surface temperatures, breaking the link with the high latitudes.","Last Glacial Maximum,Oxygen isotope,Indo-Australian summer monsoon,Kimberley,Stalagmite,"

The neural network provides a new means to capture complex and heterogeneous patterns in vesselsâ€™ behaviours, while the a contrario detector takes into account the fact that the learnt distribution may be location-dependent.

"a stackelberg game-theoretical approach to maritime counter-piracy","2019","In this paper, we provide a maritime counter-piracy framework to represent the strategies put in place and the interaction between a set of actors (patrollers and attackers) in a wide maritime scenario. Specifically, we model the interaction between patrollers and attackers in terms of a Stackelberg leader-follower game. With respect to the previous literature, we provide several innovations, in that we consider moving targets. Moreover, we let the attackers and patrollers ground their decisions not only on the current situation, but also on the expected evolution in the short or medium term. This is done by introducing in the payoff functions some projection terms, i.e., elements able to consider the future evolution of the scenario, up to a specified time window horizon. We conclude this paper with a simulation campaign considering a realistic test bed settled in the Gulf of Aden. Our experiments show that such a prediction is quite effective in generating better decisions allowing the patrollers to dynamically change targets. However, if the time horizon considered in the projection term is too large, we observe that the patrollers tend to patrol the area rather than focusing on specific vessels, and the resulting protection strategy has reduced effectiveness.","wide maritime scenario,moving targets,Bayes methods,specified time window horizon,Games,Stackelberg game-theoretical approach,Game theory,game theory,counter-piracy,maritime counter-piracy framework,Iris,future evolution,Antiterrorism,patrolling,defense strategy,Stackelberg leader-follower game,projection,Airports,Terrorism,"
"leveraging graph and deep learning uncertainties to detect anomalous maritime trajectories","2022","Understanding and representing traffic patterns are key to detecting anomalous trajectories in the transportation domain. However, some trajectories can exhibit heterogeneous maneuvering characteristics despite confining to normal patterns. Thus, we propose a novel graph-based trajectory representation and association scheme for extraction and confederation of traffic movement patterns, such that data patterns and uncertainty can be learned by deep learning (DL) models. This paper proposes the usage of a recurrent neural network (RNN)-based evidential regression model, which can predict trajectory at future timesteps as well as estimate the data and model uncertainties associated, to detect anomalous maritime trajectories, such as unusual vessel maneuvering, using automatic identification system (AIS) data. Furthermore, we utilize evidential deep learning classifiers to detect unusual turns of vessels and the loss of transmitted signal using predicted class probabilities with associated uncertainties. Our experimental results suggest that the graphical representation of traffic patterns improves the ability of the DL models, such as evidential and Monte Carlo dropout, to learn the temporal-spatial correlation of data and associated uncertainties. Using different datasets and experiments, we demonstrate that the estimated prediction uncertainty yields fundamental information for the detection of traffic anomalies in the maritime and, possibly in other domains.","Monte Carlo methods,classification,recurrent neural nets,graph,deep learning (artificial intelligence),Anomaly detection,DL models,graph-based trajectory representation,automatic identification system data,Monte Carlo dropout,graphical representation,traffic movement patterns,detect anomalous maritime trajectories,Predictive models,regression analysis,evidential deep learning,marine engineering,Data models,data patterns,pattern classification,Artificial intelligence,graph theory,RNN,regression,clustering,uncertainty,Trajectory,Uncertainty,probability,Computational modeling,traffic engineering computing,recurrent neural network-based evidential regression model,deep learning uncertainties,AIS data,"
"an early onset of enso influence in the extra-tropics of the southwest pacific inferred from a 14, 600 year high resolution multi-proxy record from paddy's lake, northwest tasmania","2017","Tropical El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is an important influence on natural systems and cultural change across the Pacific Ocean basin. El Niño events result in negative moisture anomalies in the southwest Pacific and are implicated in droughts and catastrophic wildfires across eastern Australia. An amplification of tropical El Niño activity is reported in the east Pacific after ca. 6.7 ka; however, proxy data for ENSO-driven environmental change in Australia suggest an initial influence only after ca. 5 ka. Here, we reconstruct changes in vegetation, fire activity and catchment dynamics (e.g. erosion) over the last 14.6 ka from part of the southwest Pacific in which ENSO is the main control of interannual hydroclimatic variability: Paddy's Lake, in northwest Tasmania (1065 masl), Australia. Our multi-proxy approach includes analyses of charcoal, pollen, geochemistry and radioactive isotopes. Our results reveal a high sensitivity of the local and regional vegetation to climatic change, with an increase of non-arboreal pollen between ca. 14.6–13.3 ka synchronous with the Antarctic Cold Reversal, and a sensitivity of the local vegetation and fire activity to ENSO variability recorded in the tropical east Pacific through the Holocene. We detect local-scale shifts in vegetation, fire and sediment geochemistry at ca. 6.3, 4.8 and 3.4 ka, simultaneous with increases in El Niño activity in the tropical Pacific. Finally, we observe a fire-driven shift in vegetation from a pyrophobic association dominated by rainforest elements to a pyrogenic association dominated by sclerophyllous taxa following a prolonged (>1 ka) phase of tropical ENSO-amplification and a major local fire event at ca. 3.4 ka. Our results reveal the following key insights: (1) that ENSO has been a persistent modulator of southwest Pacific climate and fire activity through the Holocene; (2) that the climate of northwest Tasmania is sensitive to long-term shifts in tropical ENSO variability; and (3) that there has been possible stationarity in the spatial influence of ENSO over this region through the Holocene.","Australia,Pollen,El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO),South-west Pacific,Palaeoecology,Geochemistry,Tasmania,Fire,"
"storm surges in the mediterranean sea: variability and trends under future climatic conditions","2015","The trends of storm surge extremes in the Mediterranean Sea for a period of 150 years (1951–2100) are explored, using a high-resolution storm surge model. Numerical simulations are forced by the output of regional climate simulations with RegCM3, which uses IPCC’s historical data on greenhouse gasses emissions for the (past) period 1951–2000, and IPCC’s A1B climate scenario for the (future) period 2001–2100. Comparisons between observations and modeling results show good agreement and confirm the ability of our model to estimate the response of the sea surface to future climatic conditions. We investigate the future trends, the variability and frequency of local extremes and the main forcing mechanisms that can induce strong surges in the Mediterranean region. Our results support that there is a general decreasing trend in storminess under the considered climate scenario, mostly related to the frequency of local peaks and the duration and spatial coverage of the storm surges. The northward shift in the location of storm tracks is a possible reason for this storminess attenuation, especially over areas where the main driving factor of extreme events is the inverted barometer effect. However, the magnitudes of sea surface elevation extremes may increase in several Mediterranean sub-regions, i.e., Southern Adriatic, Balearic and Tyrrhenian Seas, during the 21st century. There are clear distinctions in the contributions of winds and pressure fields to the sea level height for various regions of the Mediterranean Sea, as well as on the seasonal variability of extreme values; the Aegean and Adriatic Seas are characteristic examples, where high surges are predicted to be mainly induced by low pressure systems and favorable winds, respectively.","Mediterranean sea,Climate change,Storm surge,Hydrodynamic modeling,"
"reliable and efficient communications in sensor networks","2007","Wireless sensor networks are inherently plagued by problems of node failure, interference to communications from environmental noise and energy-limited sensor motes. These problems pose conflicting issues in the design of suitable routing protocols. Several existing reliable routing protocols exploit message broadcast redundancy and hop count as routing metrics and their performance trade-offs are revealed during simulation. In this paper, we study and analyse related design issues in proposed efficient and reliable routing protocols that attempt to achieve reliable and efficient communication performance in both single- and multi-hub sensor networks. Simulation results of four such routing protocols show that routing performance depends more on optimal (near-optimal) routing in single hub than in multi-hub networks. Our work also shows that optimal (near-optimal) routing is better achieved when historical metrics like packet distance traversed and transmission success are also considered in the routing protocol design.","Multi-hub network,Single hub network,Deadlock-freedom,Reliable and efficient routing,Wireless sensor network,Routing protocol design,Livelock-freedom,"
"ensemble estimates reveal a complex hydroclimatic sensitivity of pine growth at carpathian cliff sites","2012","Carpathian pine growth at its natural range limit, where small hydroclimatic fluctuations are indicated by tree-ring width anomalies, may provide insight into past ecological responses to climatic changes. Tree-ring chronologies from extreme cliff sites may also contain annually resolved and accurately dated information to facilitate the development of palaeoclimatic reconstructions. Complex and spatiotemporally inconsistent relationships between biotic and abiotic factors, however, often complicate our understanding of forest growth dynamics. In this study, we utilized a novel ensemble approach of 3240 growth–climate interactions to evaluate the likelihood of temporal fluctuations in the hydroclimatic sensitivity of three newly developed tree-ring width chronologies from 515 Scots pines (Pinus sylvestris). The data represent undisturbed cliff habitats across the northwestern Carpathian arc between 700 and 1050m asl. These sites are located in the northern (N) and southern (S) Tatra Mountains and in-between (M). Two sites (N, S) share common interannual to multi-decadal ring width variability (r=0.73), and they significantly capture variations in 20th-century summer drought conditions (r=0.52–0.65). Temporal instability in the growth–climate response, however, occurred in all three tree-ring chronologies, thus challenging any possible palaeoclimatic value. Orographic-induced climatology was found to dominate the observed growth–climate inconsistency, whereas age-related physiological mechanisms and differences in the absolute growth levels of the trees, as well as methodological standardization constraints and seasonal climate differences appeared to be less important. Our results suggest that environmental and ecological site criteria should be routinely supplemented by statistical data assessments prior to employing tree-ring chronologies for climate reconstructions.","Tatra Mountains,Dendroclimatology,Drought,Tree rings,Dendroecology,Climate variability,"
"phenological and seismological impacts on airborne pollen types: a case study of olea pollen in the region of murcia, mediterranean spanish climate","2022","The rationale of this paper was to investigate whether earthquakes impact airborne pollen concentrations, considering some meteorological parameters. Atmospheric pollen concentrations in the Region of Murcia Aerobiological Network (Spain) were studied in relation to the occurrence of earthquakes of moment magnitude (up to Mw = 5.1) and intensity (intensity up to grade VII on the European Macroseismic Scale). In this study, a decade (2010–2019) was considered across the cities of the network. Earthquakes were detected in 12 out of 1535 days in the Olea Main Pollen Season in Cartagena, 49 out of 1481 days in the Olea Main Pollen Season in Lorca, and 39 out of 1441 days in the Olea Main Pollen Season in Murcia. The Olea pollen grains in this network were attributed to the species Olea europaea, i.e., the olive tree, a taxon that appears widely in the Mediterranean basin, in both cultivated and wild subspecies. Differences between the Olea concentration on days with and without earthquakes were only found in Lorca (Kruskal-Wallis: p-value = 0.026). The low frequency and intensity of the earthquakes explained these results. The most catastrophic earthquake felt in Lorca on May 11th, 2011 (IVII, Mw = 5.1, 9 casualties) did not result in clear variations in pollen concentrations, while meteorology (e.g., African Dust Outbreak) might have conditioned these pollen concentrations. The research should be broadened to other active seismological areas to reinforce the hypothesis of seismological impact on airborne pollen concentrations.","Intensity,Magnitude,Airborne pollen,African Dust Outbreak,Earthquake,"
