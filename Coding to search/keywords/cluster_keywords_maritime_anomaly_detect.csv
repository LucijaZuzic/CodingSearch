"research on detection mechanism of vessel abnormal behavior based on immune genetic spectral clustering algorithm","2022","Maritime transport accounts for over 90% of global trade, and maritime safety has been confirmed as a vital issue of maritime transport. Accordingly, vessel traffic service system (VTS) is capable of assisting the maritime department to complete real-time supervision of a certain water area and increasing the efficiency of water supervision. However, the VTS system has low effectiveness in vessel anomaly detection and supervision, thus resulting in regulatory blind spot in the VTS system. In this study, a vessel trajectory anomaly detection mechanism is developed using the immune genetic spectral clustering method. Moreover, the contour coefficient of scatter clustering is accurately analyzed, and the clustering center is optimized using the adopted method. On that basis, different abnormal features can be detected, and abnormal detection accuracy can be increased. In this study, the vessel trajectory anomaly detection model is built in accordance with the set sliding window and abnormal threshold parameters of vessel trajectory characteristics. The AIS data of Lianyungang to Qingdao port from March 2021 are selected for experimental analysis. The results suggest that the proposed method outperforms the conventional method in the detection accuracy and the false alarm rate, it facilitates the intelligent and automatic management of vessels by the VTS system.","Immune genetic,Abnormal behavior detection,Automatic identification system (AIS),Spectral clustering,Duplicato-degree measurement,Intelligent vessel supervision,"
"vessel track information mining using ais data","2014","In recent years, vessel traffic and maritime situation awareness become more and more important for countries across the world. AIS data contains much information about vessel motion and reflects traffic characteristics. In this paper, data mining is introduced to discover motion patterns of vessel movements. Firstly, we do statistical analysis for large scale of AIS data. Secondly, we use association rules to analyze the frequent moving status of vessels. We extend the dimensions of data features, improve the algorithm in efficiency and import the concept of time scale in the algorithm based on the previous relative work. Thirdly, we introduce Markov model to make supplement for the association rules. The prediction results in the Markov process are further used to do the anomaly detection. The method in this paper provides novel idea for the research in AIS data and the management of maritime traffic.","Markov processes,data mining,Clustering algorithms,Association rules,vessel movements,Hidden Markov models,anomaly detection,Marine vehicles,Markov model,vessel traffic,maritime traffic management,statistical analysis,motion patterns,association rules,Data models,Markov,traffic information systems,vessel track information mining,traffic characteristics,maritime situation awareness,frequent moving status,vessel motion,marine vehicles,AIS data,"

"a novel model for ship trajectory anomaly detection based on gaussian mixture variational autoencoder","2023","The use of traditional methods in anomaly detection of multi-class ship trajectories showed some limitations in terms of robustness and learning ability of trajectory features. In view of this, an anomaly detection model for ship trajectory data based on Gaussian Mixture Variational Autoencoder (GMVAE) is proposed in this study using an unsupervised classification method. The proposed model modifies Variational Autoencoder (VAE) by changing the inferential distribution of prior distribution and approximate posterior to the Gaussian mixture model. A high-dimensional hidden space is constructed to learn the features of multi-class trajectory data, and the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) method is applied to measure the error between the reconstructed trajectory and the original trajectory in order to judge whether the ship trajectory is abnormal. The Automatic Identification System (AIS) data from the US coastal areas are used to verify the proposed model, and the results are compared with other commonly used models in a manually labeled dataset. The research results indicate that the detection rate of the proposed model is 91.26%, and the false alarm rate is 0.68%, which performs the best. Using the Gaussian mixture model to describe the distribution of hidden space can improve the learning ability of multi-class trajectories of VAE, thus increasing the robustness of the model. This research can provide technical support for ship trajectory data analysis and risk management of maritime transportation.","Trajectory,anomaly detection of ship trajectory,Clustering algorithms,Classification algorithms,Mathematical models,gaussian mixture variational autoencoder (gmvae),unsupervised learning,Gaussian distribution,Marine vehicles,Artificial neural networks,intelligent transportation,AIS,"
"unsupervised learning of maritime traffic patterns for anomaly detection","2012","Maritime anomaly detection requires an efficient representation and consistent knowledge of vessel behaviour. Automatic Identification System (AIS) data provides ships state vector and identity information that is here used to automatically derive knowledge of maritime traffic in an unsupervised way. The proposed approach only utilises AIS data, historical or real-time, and is aimed at incrementally learning motion patterns without any specific a priori contextual description. This can be applied to a single AIS terrestrial receiver, to regional networks or to global scale tracking. The maritime traffic representation underpins low- likelihood behaviour detection and supports enhanced Maritime Situational Awareness by providing a characterisation of vessels traffic.","vessel behaviour,Incremental Learning,ships state vector,maritime situational awareness,pattern clustering,identity information,single AIS terrestrial receiver,regional networks,automatic identification system data,marine systems,unsupervised learning,ships,anomaly detection,low-likelihood behaviour detection,Maritime Situational Awareness,Automatic Identification System,maritime traffic patterns,"

"graph representation learning with encoding edges","2019","Network embedding aims at learning the low dimensional representation of nodes. These representations can be widely used for network mining tasks, such as link prediction, anomaly detection, and classification. Recently, a great deal of meaningful research work has been carried out on this emerging network analysis paradigm. The real-world network contains different size clusters because of the edges with different relationship types. These clusters also reflect some features of nodes, which can contribute to the optimization of the feature representation of nodes. However, existing network embedding methods do not distinguish these relationship types. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised network representation learning model that can encode edge relationship information. Firstly, an objective function is defined, which can learn the edge vectors by implicit clustering. Then, a biased random walk is designed to generate a series of node sequences, which are put into Skip-Gram to learn the low dimensional node representations. Extensive experiments are conducted on several network datasets. Compared with the state-of-art baselines, the proposed method is able to achieve favorable and stable results in multi-label classification and link prediction tasks.","Edge representation,Feature learning,Network mining,Network embedding,"
"fast and parameter-light rare behavior detection in maritime trajectories","2020","Rare behaviors indicate important events and situations in maritime surveillance applications. State-of-the-art methods provide many effective solutions to detect anomalous behaviors. Meanwhile, most solutions are parameter-laden and too costly to identify useful rare behaviors with human knowledge in a visual analytics manner. This paper is concerned with a scheme cross trajectories, vessel attributes and the movement context for detecting rare behaviors through preprocessing, kNN-based clustering, and verification. Although the scheme involves several parameters, we demonstrate that they are able to be tackled in thresholds. As a result, a rare behavior factor is the single parameter that affect the detecting results. The proposed scheme is evaluated via a simulated data set for performance and a real life AIS data for effectiveness. Results show that high accuracy to labelled anomalies and useful rare behaviors can be achieved.","Rare behaviour detection,Trajectory,Visual analytics,"

Different models are trained (one per cluster), and each model is learned from highly correlated data. Finally, the results of the models are merged using a simple but efficient fusion strategy.

"improving sar wind retrieval through automatic anomalous pixel detection","2023","Satellite observations are increasingly in demand and valuable for monitoring the ocean and coastal winds in near-real-time and analyzing the data historically. However, soared up human activities, man-made constructions, and marine traffics negatively interfere and affect the reliability of observations and raise concerns about the trustworthiness of using satellite winds for many applications, such as offshore wind energy, even though Sentinel synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data is freely and easily accessible. In this paper, we presented a novel methodological framework for localization and suppression of anomalous pixels (APs), which deteriorate the confidence and accuracy of the retrieved SAR wind speeds. The backbone of the implementation relied on the constant false alarm rate (CFAR) algorithm, one of the automatic target recognition algorithms. We used a large dataset of SAR subscenes to model different sea clutter conditions after removing the potential targets. We selected the suitable distribution model that maintains a constant probability of false alarm (pfa) for the entire SAR scene. The proper pfa was optimized in various SAR scenes ranging from scenes with a considerable number of APs, such as ships and wind park clusters, to scenes with no visible APs under different wind speed conditions. The pfa optimization process prevented real wind pixels from being misidentified as APs. Applying CFAR to the logarithmic scale of raw digital numbers (log-DNs) domain with a pfa of about 3.17 × 10-5, we extracted SAR wind speeds around each ocean buoy before and after CFAR process, comparing them with their corresponding in situ wind measurements. This led to significant improvement in the quality and accuracy of SAR wind data retrieval, especially in regions with numerous man-made constructions and high marine traffics. We tested and validated our approach in the North Sea and two regions along the eastern coast of the U.S. The enclosed region, serving as a marine route for harbors in Delaware Bay, showed a substantial improvement in RMSE and BIAS after applying our approach, reducing RMSE from 2.4 m/s to 1.6 m/s and the BIAS from −1.5 m/s to −0.3 m/s. The open ocean region demonstrated stable RMSE and BIAS, indicating preservation of real wind data, as only APs affecting SAR wind speed were considered during the process.","Offshore wind farm,SAR,Sentinel-1,CFAR,Anomalous pixel,Coastal environment,"

"evaluation and comparison of anomaly detection algorithms in annotated datasets from the maritime domain","2015","Anomaly detection supports human decision makers in their surveillance tasks to ensure security. To gain the trust of the operator, it is important to develop a robust system, which gives the operator enough insight to take a rational choice about future steps. In this work, the maritime domain is investigated. Here, anomalies occur in trajectory data. Hence, a normal model for the trajectories has to be estimated. Despite the goal of anomaly detection in real life operations, until today, mostly simulated anomalies have been evaluated to measure the performance of different algorithms. Therefore, an annotation tool is developed to provide a ground truth on a non-simulative dataset. The annotated data is used to compare different algorithms with each other.

"detection and geovisualization of abnormal vessel behavior from video","2021","Intelligent maritime situational awareness pursues an effective understanding of the majority of the activities related to the maritime domain (impacting the safety, security, economy, or environment), with the aid of artificial intelligence systems. Such an understanding requires the development of automated processes capable of not only detecting abnormal behavior but also of visually-representing and interpreting it. Although much progress has been made in anomaly detection and visualization using vessel self-reporting positioning data, there have been no corresponding advances using video data, despite the increasing use of cameras for maritime surveillance. In this work, we introduce a framework which goes beyond vessel tracking for anomaly detection in video, and is therefore applicable to scenes with a high density of vessels. The proposed framework detects abnormal behavior using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and interprets this knowledge using metrics derived from clustering the positions and courses provided by an independent vessel/motion detector. These detections are geovisualized using an advanced displaying tool where detected abnormal behavior may be localized on the globe, providing an infrastructure for intelligent maritime situational awareness.","generative adversarial network,surveillance,Safety,anomaly detection,Generative adversarial networks,data visualisation,Knowledge engineering,security of data,geovisualization,intelligent maritime situational awareness,marine engineering,abnormal vessel behavior,maritime surveillance,vessel self-reporting positioning data,object detection,maritime domain,Measurement,Real-time systems,video signal processing,artificial intelligence systems,Tools,artificial intelligence,Detectors,"
"anomaly detection in maritime data based on geometrical analysis of trajectories","2015","Anomaly detection is an important use of the Automatic Identification Systems (AIS), because it offers support to users to evaluate if a vessel is in trouble or causing trouble. For instance, it can be used to detect if a ship is doing something that may cause an accident or if it has changed its route to avoid bad weather condition. In this work, a new method for finding anomalies in the ships' movements is proposed. The method analyzes the trajectory of ships from a geometrical perspective. The trajectory of the ship is compared with a near-optimal path that is generated by a graph search algorithm. The proposed method extracts some scale-invariant features from the real trajectory and also from the optimal movement pattern, and it compares the two sets of features to generate an abnormality score. The method is unsupervised and it does not require training. Instead of labeling the trajectories as normal/abnormal it calculates a score value that denotes the extent of abnormality. The scoring scheme provides a ranking system in which the user can sort the trajectories based on their abnormality score. This is useful when dealing with large number of trajectories and the user wants to picks the most abnormal cases. For the evaluation, the method was run on three months data of North Pacific Ocean and score values were generated. Among the entire dataset, 100 randomly chosen trajectories were labeled by an expert. After applying a threshold on the score value, the proposed method had 94% accuracy.","maritime data,Clustering algorithms,randomly chosen trajectories,optimal movement pattern,anomaly detection,North Pacific Ocean,Marine vehicles,abnormality score,Mathematical model,Feature extraction,geometrical trajectories analysis,scale-invariant features,ships,marine engineering,bad weather condition,AIS,Oceans,near-optimal path,ship trajectory,ship movements,graph theory,graph search algorithm,Joining processes,score values,search problems,Trajectory,automatic identification systems,"

"unsupervised maritime traffic pattern extraction from spatio-temporal data","2015","Maritime traffic pattern extraction is a fundamental and crucial factor for maritime surveillance and anomaly detection. Emerging technologies like Automatic Identification System (AIS) provides multi-dimensional data which is used to construct a maritime traffic model.

This report describes the results of 1721 regional well sites. Three samples of water were collected from each site and analyzed in four different laboratories for twenty constituents. The distribution and relationships of U, Rn, He F, CH4, Zn, Cu, Pb, Mn, Fe, pH, suspended matter, depth of well, conductivity and alkalinity are described. The elements U, Rn, He, F, along with conductivity and alkalinity, show systematic regional patterns indicating broad regional belts of element enrichment which are being leached by circulating groundwaters. The close spatial association of these elements over many tens of miles suggests chemical reaction cells or fronts similar to those observed in the uranium mining districts of Colorado and Wyoming in the United States and elsewhere. Their relatively weak character suggests an intermediate cycle in the cyclic enrichment hypothesis believed to be responsible for the formation of epigenetic uranium ore deposits. The heavy elements Zn, Cu, Pb, Mn, and Fe show positive correlation with each other but their spatial distribution is more spotty than that of the uranium elements. Broadly speaking the anomalies of these elements cluster mainly on the southern border of the survey area.

"efficient on-line anomaly detection for ship systems in operation","2019","We propose novel modifications to an anomaly detection methodology based on multivariate signal reconstruction followed by residuals analysis. The reconstructions are made using Auto Associative Kernel Regression (AAKR), where the query observations are compared to historical observations called memory vectors, representing normal operation. When the data set with historical observations grows large, the naive approach where all observations are used as memory vectors will lead to unacceptable large computational loads, hence a reduced set of memory vectors should be intelligently selected. The residuals between the observed and the reconstructed signals are analysed using standard Sequential Probability Ratio Tests (SPRT), where appropriate alarms are raised based on the sequential behaviour of the residuals. The modifications we introduce include: a novel cluster based method to select memory vectors to be considered by the AAKR, which gives an extensive reduction in computation time; a generalization of the distance measure, which makes it possible to distinguish between explanatory and response variables; and a regional credibility estimation used in the residuals analysis, to let the time used to identify if a sequence of query vectors represents an anomalous state or not, depend on the amount of data situated close to or surrounding the query vector.

The learning framework is performed on the basis of a machine learning approach that combines constrained K-means clustering for outlier detection and fuzzy modeling of distances to normality. A final score is also calculated over time, considering the membership degree to resulting fuzzy sets and a local outlier factor. Proposed solution is deployed in a CBM+ platform for online monitoring of the assets. In order to show the validity of the approach, experiments have been conducted on real operational faults in an auxiliary marine diesel engine. Experimental results show a fully comprehensive yet accurate prognostics approach, improving detection capabilities and knowledge management.

"contextual verification for false alarm reduction in maritime anomaly detection","2015","Automated vessel anomaly detection is immensely important for preventing and reducing illegal activities (e.g., drug dealing, human trafficking, etc.) and for effective emergency response and rescue in a country's territorial waters. A major limitation of previously proposed vessel anomaly detection techniques is the high rate of false alarms as these methods mainly consider vessel kinematic information which is generally obtained from AIS data. In many cases, an anomalous vessel in terms of kinematic data can be completely normal and legitimate if the 'context' at the location and time (e.g., weather and sea conditions) of the vessel is factored in. In this paper, we propose a novel anomalous vessel detection framework that utilizes such contextual information to reduce false alarms through 'contextual verification'. We evaluate our proposed framework for vessel anomaly detection using massive amount of real-life AIS data sets obtained from U.S. Coast Guard. Though our study and developed prototype is based on the maritime domain the basic idea of using contextual information through 'contextual verification' to filter false alarms can be applied to other domains as well.","Kinematics,AIS Data,emergency management,vessel kinematic information,Contextual Verification,Trajectory Clustering,Anomaly Detection,contextual verification,US coast guard,Meteorology,False Alarm Reduction,illegal activities,marine engineering,automated vessel anomaly detection,false alarms,Big data,contextual information,Context,false alarm reduction,maritime anomaly detection,Real-time systems,emergency response,Tracking,Trajectory,territorial waters,AIS data,"
"maritime vessel route extraction and automatic information system (ais) spoofing detection","2021","Automated Identification System (AIS) comprises of a global real-time network of maritime vessels, transmitters, and satellite or ground-station receivers, which are used to track and record time-stamped static (vessel-id, type, etc.) and dynamic (location, course, speed, etc.) information of all maritime vessels. Traditionally, this data feed has been used by vessel traffic services to avoid vessel collisions, however increasingly, marine researchers and data scientists have shown interest in developing algorithms on historical AIS data-dumps with diverse objectives such as estimating trends in global ocean-currents, maritime logistical planning, fishing fleet monitoring and enhancing maritime security. This paper aims to propose a novel shipping-route extraction algorithm to process historical AIS data (running into tens of gigabytes of daily data, from more than a hundred thousand maritime vessels), to effectively characterize global shipping route behaviour and capture its seasonal trends. This is done by formulating a sigmoid based turning waypoint identification, which does not solely depend on the change in the course of a vessel, derived from AIS message. The AIS data is further processed to excerpt the vesselâ€™s distance from the nearest port and nearest shore with resolution of about 1 km, which forms a handy metric for the identification of suspicious ports. Several other use cases are also explored, which include detecting various anomalies in individual vessel behaviour such as intentional or unintentional switching off AIS transmission, shipping-lane deviations, spoofing transmission messages. To tackle spoofing anomaly, various spoofing identification methods are discussed. A region-based spoofing identification algorithm is developed to identify spoofing points under multiple categories using a clustering algorithm. All the results are visualized through an open-source map overlay.

"multi-label classification for ais data anomaly detection using wavelet transform","2022","Thanks to the Automatic Identification System (AIS), ships and other maritime equipment are able to communicate with each other, for example, by sending information about their position. This solution allows for early collision detection when two or more ships are on a collision course. In the newer version of AIS, a satellite infrastructure is used to extend the communication range. Unfortunately, satellite AIS deals with so-called packet collision effect: since there is a problem with synchronizing AIS data coming from multiple terrestrial areas, a single satellite may receive several AIS messages at the same time and be unable to correctly process them, causing the data to get lost or garbled. In this article, a machine learning based framework for detecting the incorrect AIS data is presented. In this approach, after the first stage (clustering), a dedicated anomaly detection algorithm searches for damaged AIS messages and conducts multi-label classification (with Random Forest and wavelet transform) to decide which fields of such message requires further correction. The results of measuring the effectiveness of the proposed approach using real AIS data are presented.","telecommunication security,Clustering algorithms,incorrect AIS data,single satellite,Anomaly detection,Wavelet transforms,anomaly detection,random forests,collision course,Marine vehicles,Machine learning,damaged AIS messages,Data analysis,dedicated anomaly detection algorithm searches,satellite communication,ships,wavelet transform,pattern classification,random forest,Classification algorithms,multiple terrestrial areas,pattern clustering,machine learning based framework,Artificial intelligence,multi-label classification,multilabel classification,wavelet transforms,satellite infrastructure,AIS data anomaly detection,maritime equipment,communication range,Trajectory,marine communication,Labeling,early collision detection,AIS data analysis,packet collision effect,satellite AIS deals,"

"synthetic trajectory extraction for maritime anomaly detection","2018","In the maritime domain, the main goal for large vessels is to drive as fast and efficiently as possible from one harbour to the next. This results in vessels following quite distinct routes. Deviations from these routes can be seen as indicators for illegal or at least suspicious behaviour. In order to extract these routes, clustering algorithms can be used, that will store the traffic patterns as synthetic trajectories. A vessel can be assigned to a specific route or a deviation from the routes can be detected by evaluating these route models. A challenge in designing the synthetic trajectories lies in the faithful representation, sparsity of data, treatment of outliers and split-up of routes. Here, a novel approach to model the uncertainty of the vessels movements while following a route is introduced: A cluster is now represented by a trajectory consisting of segments. Due to obstacles like shallow waters, a route might split up which will generate sub-segments. Instead of storing all cluster points, the position, speed, and course of the vessels are attached to each segment in form of normal distributions. Using these attributes, the probability of a deviation from the given trajectory can be estimated.","Clustering algorithms,Kernel,vessels movements,Anomaly detection,anomaly detection,traffic patterns,security of data,trajectory representation,ships,clustering algorithms,marine engineering,maritime domain,Heating systems,route models,pattern clustering,Artificial intelligence,maritime anomaly detection,synthetic trajectory extraction,Trajectory,data sparsity,probability,Gaussian distribution,data handling,"
"data mining approach to shipping route characterization and anomaly detection based on ais data","2020","A data mining approach is presented for probabilistic characterization of maritime traffic and anomaly detection. The approach automatically groups historical traffic data provided by the Automatic Identification System in terms of ship types, sizes, final destinations and other characteristics that influence the maritime traffic patterns off the continental coast of Portugal. The approach consists of identifying relevant waypoints along a route where significant changes in the ships’ navigational behaviour are observed, such as changes in heading, using trajectory compression and clustering algorithms. This provides a vector-based representation of the ship routes consisting of straight legs and connecting turning sections that facilitates route probabilistic characterization and anomaly detection. The maritime traffic is characterized probabilistically at the identified route legs and waypoints in terms of lateral distribution of the trajectories and speed profile, which allows the characterization of the typical behaviour of a group of similar ships along a particular route. In the proposed approach heading changes are automatically detected using the Douglas and Peucker algorithm and clustered by the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise algorithm. The proposed method is applied to the characterization of southbound maritime traffic from the traffic separation scheme off Cape Roca to the ports of Lisbon, Setúbal and Sines. Finally, an example of ship trajectory anomaly detection based on the developed maritime traffic probabilistic models is provided.","Traffic characterization,Maritime traffic,Anomaly detection,Data mining,AIS data,"
"on the interest of data mining for an integrity assessment of ais messages","2016","Put in place by the International Maritime Organization, the Automatic Identification System is a worldwide maritime electronic system that sends radio broadcasted messages at a high rate between the stations, either on board the vessels or on shores. However, some misuses of the system such as identity theft, localization spoofing or disappearances have been demonstrated. The high rate of transmission implies a considerable amount of data to process in order to point out those irregularities. This paper proposes a method based on data mining and clustering methods combined to an integrity assessment of AIS messages for anomaly detection, with a proposition of software architecture for a data processing done both on-the-fly and with archived data. The computation of confidence coefficients and the use of data mining techniques will lead to behaviour characterization with the purpose of enhance the maritime situational awareness.","data mining,Safety,AIS message integrity assessment,anomaly detection,Marine vehicles,integrity assessment,security of data,clustering methods,Radio navigation,Object recognition,maritime situational awareness,automatic identification system,marine engineering,Automatic Identification System,International Maritime Organization,software architecture,data falsification,pattern clustering,Artificial intelligence,data processing,maritime electronic system,Clustering methods,Data mining,"
"unsupervised extraction of knowledge from s-ais data for maritime situational awareness","2013","Automatic vessel behaviour analysis is a key factor for maritime surveillance and relies on an efficient representation of knowledge about vessels activity. Emerging technologies such as space-based AIS provides a new dimension of service and creates a need for new methods able to learn a maritime scene model at an oceanic scale.

"vessel sailing patterns analysis from s-ais data dased on k-means clustering algorithm","2019","Automatic Identification System (AIS) provides abundant near real-time information of moving vessels in the sea of the whole world and has been widely used in the fields of vessel collision avoidance, Maritime Situation Awareness (MSA) and ocean surveillance. The development of satellite-based AIS further expands the range of AIS and enables a wide converge of AIS data collection, which solves the problem of lacking AIS data in high-seas. At the same time, AIS data provides a rich source for data mining for maritime traffic analysis. In this paper, a typical clustering algorithm called K-means is applied to deal with the Space-based AIS(S-AIS) data received by â€œTianTuo-3â€ satellite developed by National University of Defense Technology. We use Elbow Rule to determine the optimal number of clusters and calculate the normalized standard deviation of COG(Course Over Ground) and SOG(Speed Over Ground) of vessels in south Africa area as their features to conduct clustering. This method is supposed to evaluate vessels' sailing stability and used in detection of low-likelihood behaviors or anomalies of vessels.","SOG,surveillance,data mining,Clustering algorithms,vessel behavior,Marine vehicles,vessel collision avoidance,AIS data collection,ocean surveillance,TianTuo-3 satellite,elbow rule,speed over ground,space-based AIS ata,ships,satellite-based AIS,marine safety,K-means,marine engineering,automatic identification system,vessel anomaly,Elbow,k-means clustering algorithm,vessel sailing patterns analysis,pattern clustering,COG,Artificial intelligence,maritime traffic analysis,Satellite broadcasting,South Africa,course over ground,Trajectory,national security,artificial satellites,clustering algorithm,Data mining,normalized standard deviation,Maritime traffic analysis,Space-based AIS,S-AIS data,"
"a distance-based trajectory outlier detection method on maritime traffic data","2018","As a result of establishment of Automatic Identification System (AIS) networks, maritime vessel trajectories are becoming increasingly available. Finding outliers in a collection of patterns among AIS trajectories is critical for real time applications ranging from military surveillance to transportation management. In this paper we present a distance-based approach for trajectory outlier detection on trajectory data. First, we apply Density Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) to generate patterns from original trajectories. Second, we extract gravity vectors and sample stop points from clusters to retain stop and move information and to reduce the further computation cost. To measure the similarity between trajectory points and clusters, cluster relative distance and cluster angular distance are proposed. Finally, we present experiments on real AIS data at Chinese QiongZhou strait. The experiment results show that our methods can detect distance anomaly and speed/heading anomaly effectively and greatly reduces computation cost.","data mining,Clustering algorithms,maritime traffic data,Anomaly detection,trajectory data,AIS networks,Chinese QiongZhou strait,speed anomaly detection,cluster,trajectory points,density based spatial clustering of applications with noise,outlier detection,cluster relative distance,DBSCAN,Gravity,marine safety,marine engineering,computation cost,AIS,Data models,cluster angular distance,trajectory data mining,distance anomaly,trajectory outlier detection,gravity vectors,AIS trajectories,pattern clustering,Artificial intelligence,distance-based approach,distance-based trajectory outlier detection method,maritime vessel trajectories,heading anomaly detection,Trajectory,traffic engineering computing,stop points,automatic identification system networks,AIS data,"
"leveraging graph and deep learning uncertainties to detect anomalous maritime trajectories","2022","Understanding and representing traffic patterns are key to detecting anomalous trajectories in the transportation domain. However, some trajectories can exhibit heterogeneous maneuvering characteristics despite confining to normal patterns. Thus, we propose a novel graph-based trajectory representation and association scheme for extraction and confederation of traffic movement patterns, such that data patterns and uncertainty can be learned by deep learning (DL) models. This paper proposes the usage of a recurrent neural network (RNN)-based evidential regression model, which can predict trajectory at future timesteps as well as estimate the data and model uncertainties associated, to detect anomalous maritime trajectories, such as unusual vessel maneuvering, using automatic identification system (AIS) data. Furthermore, we utilize evidential deep learning classifiers to detect unusual turns of vessels and the loss of transmitted signal using predicted class probabilities with associated uncertainties. Our experimental results suggest that the graphical representation of traffic patterns improves the ability of the DL models, such as evidential and Monte Carlo dropout, to learn the temporal-spatial correlation of data and associated uncertainties. Using different datasets and experiments, we demonstrate that the estimated prediction uncertainty yields fundamental information for the detection of traffic anomalies in the maritime and, possibly in other domains.","Monte Carlo methods,classification,recurrent neural nets,graph,deep learning (artificial intelligence),Anomaly detection,DL models,graph-based trajectory representation,automatic identification system data,Monte Carlo dropout,graphical representation,traffic movement patterns,detect anomalous maritime trajectories,Predictive models,regression analysis,evidential deep learning,marine engineering,Data models,data patterns,pattern classification,Artificial intelligence,graph theory,RNN,regression,clustering,uncertainty,Trajectory,Uncertainty,probability,Computational modeling,traffic engineering computing,recurrent neural network-based evidential regression model,deep learning uncertainties,AIS data,"
"a novel hybrid approach for detecting abnormal vessel behavior in maritime traffic","2023","The Abnormal Behavior Detection of Vessels (ABVD) is crucial for enhancing Vesselsâ€™ situational awareness as well as achieving effective management of maritime traffic. Clustering algorithms are extensively employed for ABVD tasks, however, they are not only time-consuming but also frequently inaccurate when dealing with complex and dynamic vessel trajectory detection tasks. To address the above problems, we propose a novel hybrid approach, CSDLSTM(Course/Speed-DBSCAN and LSTM), which combines Density-based Clustering(DBSCAN) and long short-term memory networks to improve the efficiency of ABVD. Specifically, a three-dimensional CS-DBSCAN (Course/Speed-DBSCAN) algorithm is proposed, which incorporates speed and course features along with geospatial information in the clustering process to accurately describe vessel behavior. In addition, the clustering results are used as traffic patterns to train the LSTM predictor for real-time maritime anomaly detection. Experiments conducted on real AIS datasets demonstrate that the CSD-LSTM method has greater precision and efficiency in ABVD.","Traffic control,Transportation,Clustering algorithms,LSTM,Prediction algorithms,CS-DBSCAN,Sensitivity,Real-time systems,Heuristic algorithms,abnormal vessel behavior,"
