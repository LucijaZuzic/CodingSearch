"evaluation and comparison of anomaly detection algorithms in annotated datasets from the maritime domain","2015","Anomaly detection supports human decision makers in their surveillance tasks to ensure security. To gain the trust of the operator, it is important to develop a robust system, which gives the operator enough insight to take a rational choice about future steps. In this work, the maritime domain is investigated. Here, anomalies occur in trajectory data. Hence, a normal model for the trajectories has to be estimated. Despite the goal of anomaly detection in real life operations, until today, mostly simulated anomalies have been evaluated to measure the performance of different algorithms. Therefore, an annotation tool is developed to provide a ground truth on a non-simulative dataset. The annotated data is used to compare different algorithms with each other. For the given dataset, first experiments are conducted with the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and the Kernel Density Estimator (KDE). For the evaluation of the algorithms, precision, recall, and f1-score are compared.","surveillance,GMM,Clustering algorithms,Hidden Markov models,Intelligent systems,Anomaly detection,Gaussian Mixture Model,trajectory data,annotation tool,human decision making,operator trust,Sea measurements,nonsimulative dataset,mixture models,kernel density estimator,marine engineering,Gaussian processes,recall value,ground truth,maritime domain,robust system,Maritime domain,f1-score value,Kernel Density Estimation,Gaussian mixture model,annotated datasets,Trajectory,surveillance tasks,anomaly detection algorithms,Surveillance,normal model,precision value,KDE,"

"fitting empirical distributions for vessels behavioural analysis and maritime anomaly detection","2023","Naval behaviour characterization and maritime anomaly detection represents two active area of research. Although multiple probabilistic approaches have been implemented for explaining different parametric maritime phenomena, most of them are focused only on the analysis of primary kinematic data, such as position, speed, course of vessels, or lateral displacement relative to an obstacle. This article presents an analysis on multiple complex maritime activities (e.g., fishing, drifting, hidden activities) that were derived by processing AIS messages collected in the Black Sea region. Quantitative histograms were made for each type of activity while probability and cumulative distribution functions were plotted using kernel density estimation applications. After that, multiple evaluation metrics analysed the possibilities of representing these distributions in the form of known parametric distributions (e.g., Gaussian, Gamma, Rayleigh, Log-normal). Finally, there were extracted the parameters that best fitted these distributions. Also, a universal parametric distribution was searched to best fit all observed maritime activities.","statistical distributions,universal parametric distribution,kernel density estimation applications,Safety,primary kinematic data,AIS messages,vessel behavioural analysis,Sea measurements,cumulative distribution functions,parametric maritime phenomena,probabilistic approaches,quantitative histograms,marine engineering,hidden activities,AIS,vessels behaviour,Probabilistic logic,Probability distribution,probability distribution fitting,Measurement,maritime anomaly detection,Statistical analysis,empirical distributions,naval behaviour characterization,Fitting,Black Sea region,empirical data,data handling,multiple complex maritime activities,"
