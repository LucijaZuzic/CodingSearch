"learning temporal features for detection on maritime airborne video sequences using convolutional lstm","2019","In this paper, we study the effectiveness of learning temporal features to improve detection performance in videos captured by small aircraft. To implement this learning process, we use a convolutional long short-term memory (LSTM) associated with a pretrained convolutional neural network (CNN). To improve the training process, we incorporate domain-specific knowledge about the expected size and number of boats. We carry out three tests. The first searches the best sequence length and subsampling rate for training and the second compares the proposed method with a traditional CNN, a traditional LSTM, and a gated recurrent unit (GRU). The final test evaluates our method with the already published detectors in two data sets. Results show that in favorable conditions, our method's performance is comparable to other detectors but, on more challenging environments, it stands out from other techniques.","aircraft,recurrent neural nets,training process,remote monitoring,learning process,temporal features,Aircraft,recurrent neural networks,Monitoring,Feature extraction,Video sequences,sequence length,short-term memory,ships,pretrained convolutional neural network,expected size,object detection,traditional CNN,traditional LSTM,domain-specific knowledge,detection performance,final test,convolutional neural nets,subsampling rate,image sequences,Boats,Visualization,Object detection,learning (artificial intelligence),convolutional LSTM,maritime airborne video sequences,Detectors,"
"fault detection with lstm-based variational autoencoder for maritime components","2021","Maintenance routines on ships today follow either a reactive maintenance (RM) or preventive maintenance (PvM) approach. RM can be regarded as post-failure repair, which might create large costs. PvM uses predetermined maintenance intervals, which often involves unnecessary maintenance. Recently, prognostics and health management (PHM) has emerged as a potential way to develop an ideal maintenance policy. PHM aims to provide optimal maintenance schedule through the use of sensor measurement for fault detection and fault prognostics, among which fault detection is the first and fundamental action. In this paper, a long-short term memory based variational autoencoder (LSTM-VAE) is proposed for fault detection of maritime components onboard. It is a semi-supervised approach that requires only fault-free data for training. Therefore, it is widely applicable in the maritime industry since operational data in normal conditions already exists. Real-world operation data collected from a diesel engine on the research vessel (RV) Gunnerus is used to validate the method. Results show that the LSTM-VAE can detect the fault accurately.","Decoding,unnecessary maintenance,maritime components,fault-free data,optimal maintenance schedule,preventive maintenance,prognostic and health management,Anomaly detection,anomaly detection,Recurrent neural networks,maintenance engineering,fault detection,ship autonomy,fault prognostics,maintenance routines,ships,PvM,Prognostics and health management,LSTM-VAE,maintenance intervals,railway safety,PHM,Fault detection,condition monitoring,Training,post-failure repair,ideal maintenance policy,LSTM-based variational autoencoder,Sensors,RM,fault diagnosis,"
"geotracknetâ€”a maritime anomaly detector using probabilistic neural network representation of ais tracks and a contrario detection","2022","Representing maritime traffic patterns and detecting anomalies from them are key to vessel monitoring and maritime situational awareness. We propose a novel approachâ€”referred to as GeoTrackNetâ€”for maritime anomaly detection from AIS data streams. Our model exploits state-of-the-art neural network schemes to learn a probabilistic representation of AIS tracks and a contrario detection to detect abnormal events. The neural network provides a new means to capture complex and heterogeneous patterns in vesselsâ€™ behaviours, while the a contrario detector takes into account the fact that the learnt distribution may be location-dependent. Experiments on a real AIS dataset comprising more than 4.2 million AIS messages demonstrate the relevance of the proposed method compared with state-of-the-art schemes.","heterogeneous patterns,motion estimation,GeoTrackNet,naval engineering computing,Anomaly detection,Geospatial analysis,anomaly detection,probabilistic representation,variational recurrent neural networks,AIS messages,maritime traffic patterns,maritime anomaly detector,AIS dataset,maritime situational awareness,neural nets,probabilistic neural network representation,deep learning,ships,marine engineering,AIS data streams,complex patterns,contrario detection,AIS,maritime surveillance,object detection,Probabilistic logic,a contrario detection,Artificial intelligence,maritime anomaly detection,Trajectory,Task analysis,vessel monitoring,contrario detector,learning (artificial intelligence),state-of-the-art neural network schemes,Detectors,AIS tracks,"
"a big data approach for fuel oil consumption estimation in the maritime industry","2022","Route optimization has been a research topic for many years in the maritime industry and it constitutes one of the key components to improving energy efficiency and sustainability in ship operations. This paper deals with the challenge of estimating Fuel Oil Consumption (FOC) in the context of Weather Routing (WR). Given a plethora of features collected from the vesselâ€™s Automatic Identification System (AIS) or on-board sensor installations, we examine how a predictive FOC scheme can be coupled with WR optimization algorithms in order to reduce the vesselâ€™s FOC, emissions, and the overall cost of a voyage. In order to handle the amount of data required for FOC prediction, we employ a streaming pipeline that harvests data in real-time from different sources and processes them appropriately for visualization, causal analysis, and forecasting purposes. In this direction, we first conduct an exploratory analysis to examine and unveil the importance and inter-association between the various variables related to sea-keeping and weather features, in order to utilize them effectively in the context of a FOC predictive scheme. Furthermore, we introduce a novel recurrent neural network architecture that approximates ideally the underlying function describing the features and the vesselâ€™s FOC by taking into account historical data, and we showcase the results. Finally, we demonstrate how the FOC prediction model can be coupled with a WR algorithm to propose the optimal route for a vessel in terms of FOC efficiency.","big data collection,recurrent neural nets,sustainability,recurrent neural network architecture,sea-keeping weather features,Prediction algorithms,fuel oil consumption,WR optimization,Recurrent neural networks,Industries,recurrent neural networks,causal analysis,ship operations,information processing,weather routing,exploratory analysis,vessel data,fuel oil consumption estimation,Oils,ships,automatic identification system,energy efficiency,AIS,optimal route,optimisation,sea-keeping,fuel economy,Big Data,petroleum,on-board sensor installations,Routing,energy consumption,shipbuilding industry,energy conservation,route optimization,maritime industry,weather routing optimization,vessel,production engineering computing,Fuels,FOC prediction,"
"a multi-task deep learning architecture for maritime surveillance using ais data streams","2018","In a world of global trading, maritime safety, security and efficiency are crucial issues. We propose a multi-task deep learning framework for vessel monitoring using Automatic Identification System (AIS) data streams. We combine recurrent neural networks with latent variable modeling and an embedding of AIS messages to a new representation space to jointly address key issues to be dealt with when considering AIS data streams: massive amount of streaming data, noisy data and irregular time-sampling. We demonstrate the relevance of the proposed deep learning framework on real AIS datasets for a three-task setting, namely trajectory reconstruction, anomaly detection and vessel type identification.","three-task setting,crucial issues,recurrent neural nets,representation space,anomaly detection,Recurrent neural networks,multitask deep learning framework,trajectory reconstruction,recurrent neural networks,considering AIS data streams,variational recurrent neural networks,AIS messages,vessel type identification,Noise measurement,latent variable modeling,noisy data,deep learning,data analysis,AIS,maritime surveillance,Data models,streaming data,automatic identification system data streams,AIS datasets,trans fer learning,Trajectory,Deep learning,Task analysis,multitask deep learning architecture,global trading,vessel monitoring,learning (artificial intelligence),maritime safety,"
"ais data-driven ship trajectory prediction modelling and analysis based on machine learning and deep learning methods","2023","Maritime transport faces new safety challenges in an increasingly complex traffic environment caused by large-scale and high-speed ships, particularly with the introduction of intelligent and autonomous ships. It is evident that Automatic Identification System (AIS) data-driven ship trajectory prediction can effectively aid in identifying abnormal ship behaviours and reducing maritime risks such as collision, stranding, and contact. Furthermore, trajectory prediction is widely recognised as one of the critical technologies for realising safe autonomous navigation. The prediction methods and their performance are the key factors for future safe and automatic shipping. Currently, ship trajectory prediction lacks the real performance measurement and analysis of different algorithms, including classical machine learning and emerging deep learning methods. This paper aims to systematically analyse the performance of ship trajectory prediction methods and pioneer experimental tests to reveal their advantages and disadvantages as well as fitness in different scenarios involving complicated systems. To do so, five machine learning methods (i.e., Kalman Filter (KF), Support Vector Progression (SVR), Back Propagation network (BP), Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), and Random Forest (RF)) and seven deep learning methods (i.e., Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gate Recurrent Unit (GRU), Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM), Sequence to Sequence (Seq2seq), Bi-directional Gate Recurrent Unit (Bi-GRU), and Transformer) are first extracted from the state-of-the-art literature review and then employed to implement the trajectory prediction and compare their prediction performance in the real world. Three AIS datasets are collected from the waters of representative traffic features, including a normal channel (i.e., the Chengshan Jiao Promontory), complex traffic (i.e., the Zhoushan Archipelago), and a port area (i.e., Caofeidian port). They are selected to test and analyse the performance of all twelve methods based on six evaluation indexes and explore the characteristics and effectiveness of the twelve trajectory prediction methods in detail. The experimental results provide a novel perspective, comparison, and benchmark for ship trajectory prediction research, which not only demonstrates the fitness of each method in different maritime traffic scenarios, but also makes significant contributions to maritime safety and autonomous shipping development.","Deep learning,Maritime safety,Trajectory prediction,AIS data,Machine learning,"
"leveraging graph and deep learning uncertainties to detect anomalous maritime trajectories","2022","Understanding and representing traffic patterns are key to detecting anomalous trajectories in the transportation domain. However, some trajectories can exhibit heterogeneous maneuvering characteristics despite confining to normal patterns. Thus, we propose a novel graph-based trajectory representation and association scheme for extraction and confederation of traffic movement patterns, such that data patterns and uncertainty can be learned by deep learning (DL) models. This paper proposes the usage of a recurrent neural network (RNN)-based evidential regression model, which can predict trajectory at future timesteps as well as estimate the data and model uncertainties associated, to detect anomalous maritime trajectories, such as unusual vessel maneuvering, using automatic identification system (AIS) data. Furthermore, we utilize evidential deep learning classifiers to detect unusual turns of vessels and the loss of transmitted signal using predicted class probabilities with associated uncertainties. Our experimental results suggest that the graphical representation of traffic patterns improves the ability of the DL models, such as evidential and Monte Carlo dropout, to learn the temporal-spatial correlation of data and associated uncertainties. Using different datasets and experiments, we demonstrate that the estimated prediction uncertainty yields fundamental information for the detection of traffic anomalies in the maritime and, possibly in other domains.","Monte Carlo methods,classification,recurrent neural nets,graph,deep learning (artificial intelligence),Anomaly detection,DL models,graph-based trajectory representation,automatic identification system data,Monte Carlo dropout,graphical representation,traffic movement patterns,detect anomalous maritime trajectories,Predictive models,regression analysis,evidential deep learning,marine engineering,Data models,data patterns,pattern classification,Artificial intelligence,graph theory,RNN,regression,clustering,uncertainty,Trajectory,Uncertainty,probability,Computational modeling,traffic engineering computing,recurrent neural network-based evidential regression model,deep learning uncertainties,AIS data,"
