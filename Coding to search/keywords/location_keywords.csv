"feasibility study of gnss as navigation system to reach the moon","2015","Reaching the Moon poses very strict requirements in terms of performance, flexibility and cost for all the spacecraft subsystems. These requirements become more stringent if the mission is designed to be accomplished using a small spacecraft. The navigation subsystem is without any doubts essential and nowadays, several systems offer different solutions to the navigation problem. Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSSs) such as GPS, GLONASS, or the future Galileo and BeiDou systems, introduce an easier way to provide an autonomous on-board orbit determination system; they only require an on-board GNSS receiver, with low-cost, low-power consumption and limited mass and volume. While GNSS receivers have been already exploited with success for Low Earth Orbit (LEO), their use for very High Earth Orbit (HEO) up to the Moon altitude is still at the research stage. In this context, the purpose of the present work is to determine the potential achievable accuracy of a code-based GNSS receiver solution, during the whole trajectory to reach the Moon. GPS, Galileo, and GPS-Galileo combined (dual constellation) solutions are estimated, by considering constellations availability, pseudorange error factors and geometry factors. Unlike previous investigations, our study is making use of the very accurate multi-GNSS constellation simulator “Spirent GSS8000”, which supports simultaneously the GPS and Galileo systems with L1, L5, E1, and E5 frequency bands. The contribution of this study, clearly demonstrates that GNSS signals can be tracked up to the Moon׳s surface, but not with the current GNSS receiver׳s technology for terrestrial use. We consider and discuss a possible navigation solution that uses a double constellation GPS-Galileo receiver aided by an on board orbital filter system in order to improve the accuracy of the navigation solution and achieve the required sensitivity.","GNSS,GNSS receiver,Moon exploration,Moon Transfer Orbit (MTO),GPS,Space navigation,"
"online detection of anomaly behaviors based on multidimensional trajectories","2020","In the surveillance domain, timely detection of anomaly behaviors is very important and is a great challenge to human operators due to information overload, fatigue and inattention. Many anomaly detection algorithms based on trajectories have been proposed for this problem. However, these algorithms generally have problems such as complex parameter setting, unfaithful statistical model, not well-calibrated false alarm rate, poor ability of online learning and sequential anomaly detection, etc. The theory of conformal prediction was introduced to solve these problems by constructing the sequential Hausdorff nearest neighbor conformal anomaly detector. Yet, it only considers position information of the targets and is not sensitive to velocity and course anomaly behaviors. And the run times are increasing as the increase of the data size, which is not appropriate for early warning surveillance application. In order to solve these problems, sequential multi-factor Hausdorff nearest neighbor conformal anomaly detector (SMFHNNCAD) and sequential multi-factor Hausdorff nearest neighbor inductive conformal anomaly detector (SMFHNNICAD) based on multidimensional trajectories are proposed in this paper. Experiments in both simulated military scenario and realistic civilian scenario show the presented algorithm has a good performance to online detect anomaly behaviors and would have a wide prospect in early warning surveillance systems.","Multidimensional,Anomaly behavior,Trajectory,Online detection,"
"perspectives on aerosol deposition to natural surfaces: interactions between aerosol residence times, removal processes, the biosphere and global environmental change","1990","This paper summarizes the state-of-the-art and the research needs in the areas of aerosol residence-time assessments, deposition modelling, and understanding of aerosols in biogeochemistry. Research needs are emphasized from a systems perspective of global environmental change. Although fundamental quantitative knowledge is lacking, some qualitative linkages between source strengths, residence times, removal processes and the biosphere can be identified. It turns out that not only are the respective areas as such challenged by new problems, superimposed on the fairly well established conventional ones, but these areas also face mutually operating sets of feedbacks between residence times and sink/source characteristics of ecological systems subject to stress. To evaluate the sensitivity of these feedback loops, and to assess whether they are negative (stabilizing interactions) or positive (destabilizing) are important and potentially urgent tasks. Such studies should focus on a common goal, such as developing empirical and theoretical understanding of aerosol resuspension, transport and deposition for application in large-scale circulation models. A basic link in such advancements is that structural change of vegetated surfaces of the biosphere caused by deposition itself, and by changing land-use and climate, be understood and assessed.",""
"function-shape-based particle swarm optimization and its application in maritime static target cooperative search","2017","The application of particle swarm algorithm in optimization has been growing over the last few years, but this approach becomes computationally impracticable when the complexity of the problem increases. In this context, an improvement of the particle swarm algorithm-the function-shape-based particle swarm optimization (FSPSO) is presented. For a practical maritime cooperative search problem, FSPSO makes particles move around in the corresponding solution space according to certain rules to gather information firstly. Then FSPSO exploits the history data acquired during the first process to analyze the shape of the solution space. Based on the knowledge about the function shape, FSPSO generates solutions and iteration strategies. At last, the position and speed of each particle will be updated iteratively, aiming at producing a high quality solution to the optimization problem. The main idea behind FSPSO is to hybridize PSO with the search mode of a human being. This paper uses maritime static target cooperative search as a test domain. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of FSPSO, we perform a comparison between the performances of FSPSO with other approaches drawn from the scientific literature. Results demonstrate that FSPSO is able to produce statistically significantly higher quality solutions, outperforming many other approaches.","Decoding,Generators,history data,heuristics,information theory,particle swarm optimisation,Software packages,particle swarm optimization,maritime search,Multiplexing,iteration strategies,practical maritime cooperative search problem,Complexity theory,search problems,function shape,maritime static target cooperative search,FSPSO,function-shape,Algorithm design and analysis,cooperative,particle swarm algorithm-the,Field programmable gate arrays,"
"maritime anomaly detection in a real-world scenario: ever given grounding in the suez canal","2022","In this paper we present how automatic maritime anomaly detection tools can be successfully applied in real-world situations such as the major event of the container vessel Ever Given, which grounded in the Suez Canal on March 23rd 2021. The anomaly detector is designed to process the available sequence of Automatic Identification System (AIS) reports, information from ground-based or satellite radar systems if available, and contextual information defining the expected nominal behavior of navigation. A statistical hypothesis testing procedure is sequentially run to decide whether or not a deviation from the nominal behavior happened within a specific time period, for instance two consecutive data points. We show, based on the recorded AIS data from the Ever Given, that the proposed detector could have been triggered and alerted to anomalous behavior fully 19 minutes before the grounding.","anomaly detector,Anomaly detection,Marine vehicles,Grounding,statistical hypothesis testing,Ever Given grounding,automatic maritime anomaly detection tools,statistical analysis,Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process,Testing,ships,Containers,automatic identification system,radar,maritime surveillance,satellite radar systems,contextual information,container vessel,Suez Canal,Artificial intelligence,ground-based system,marine engineering computing,Maritime anomaly detection,Irrigation,statistical hypothesis testing procedure,expected nominal behavior,AIS data,"
"a semi-supervised deep learning approach for vessel trajectory classification based on ais data","2022","Automatic identification system (AIS) refers to a new type of navigation aid system equipped in maritime vehicles to monitor ship performance. It provides trajectory information of vessels which can be used for the classification task. The classification results facilitate ocean surveillance and conservation, vessel management enhancement, fishery regulation, marine ecological sustainability, and nautical safety protection. Some progresses have been made based on machine learning or deep learning strategies to perform supervised learning by assuming that during the training process, the category labels of historical trajectory data are available. However, in reality, the label information may be difficult or expensive to obtain, resulting in that only a small part of the training data is labeled, and most of the training data is unlabeled. To address this issue, this paper proposes a semi-supervised deep learning approach to integrate the knowledge of unlabeled data for vessel trajectory classification. Here, we call our approach SSL-VTC. Specifically, we first extract vessel trajectories by integrating the kinematic and static information from historical AIS messages. Then, we design convolutional neural networks to extract feature representations from the vessel trajectories. Finally, we develop a semi-supervised learning algorithm based on the variational autoencoder to perform discriminative learning and generative learning simultaneously. In this way, our SSL-VTC framework can fully leverage the labeled data and unlabeled data during the training process. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to utilize semi-supervised learning for vessel trajectory classification. Experimental results on the public AIS dataset show that our SSL-VTC can effectively extract feature representations from the AIS messages and its performance is significantly better than the traditional supervised learning methods. The approach and findings of this study provide important implications for researchers and stakeholders in the field of ocean management.","Vessel trajectory classification,Variational autoencoder,Deep learning,Semi-supervised learning,Automatic identification system,"
"intensified aridity over the indo-pacific warm pool controlled by ice-sheet expansion during the last glacial maximum","2022","The magnitude, direction and cause of precipitation changes across the Indo-Pacific Warm Pool (IPWP) during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) remain elusive. In particular, it is still inconclusive whether tropical or extra-tropical factors controlled such precipitation changes. Determining the spatio-temporal distribution of precipitation in the IPWP during the LGM is a valid strategy to address this issue, but the existing precipitation records are dominantly from maritime continents and marginal seas, with few data from pelagic oceans. In order to fill this gap, we analyzed the oxygen isotopic compositions of single Ethmodiscus rex diatom frustules (δ18OE. rex) from a sediment core (WPD-03) consisting of laminated diatom mats (LDMs) in the eastern Philippine Sea (EPS). δ18OE. rex was controlled mainly by sea-surface salinity variation and, thus, can reflect open-ocean precipitation changes across the IPWP. Our precipitation proxy records, in combination with existing published data, reveal spatial patterns of precipitation change that indicate overall drying across the IPWP during the LGM. Based on a comparison of paleoclimatic records with modeling results, we propose that extra-tropical factors (ice-sheet size) controlled precipitation variability in the IPWP during the LGM through a combination of zonal shifts of ENSO and meridional migration of the ITCZ. Strong aridity during the LGM prevented formation of a subsurface barrier layer and, hence, allowed accessing of sufficient nutrients to surface waters, stimulating blooms of E. rex and subsequent formation of LDMs in the IPWP. These findings suggest an important role for high-latitude climate in the tropical hydrological cycle during the LGM.","Tropical West Pacific,Diatom blooms,Sea-surface salinity,Model simulation,Tropical hydroclimate,High-latitude forcing,"
"optimal maneuvering and control of cooperative vehicles as case study for maritime applications within harbors","2019","This paper presents the development of a networked control system for maritime applications within the joint project GALILEOnautic to enable autonomous shipping and optimal maneuvering in harbor environments. To achieve this objective, all networked vehicles estimate position, velocity, orientation and time dynamically using a maritime navigation filter. These vehicle states are broadcasted to a central computation unit via long term evolution (LTE) mobile communication in combination with virtual private network (VPN). After a data synchronization step, an optimization algorithm uses the vessel states to calculate model-based optimal trajectories for each networked participant. These trajectories consist of target positions at certain instants of time and optimal settings for the rudder and propulsion units which are used as feedforward variables for a local trajectory controller on each vessel. To compensate smaller errors due to model inaccuracies during trajectory calculation, a feedback control loop is also established. Beside active network participants, other vehicles can be considered as well using data which is broadcasted by the automatic identification system (AIS). This paper presents the promising results of GALILEOnautic demonstrating an encounter situation of two networked vessels and one disturbing, non-networked participant. To demonstrate how the approach is able to avoid critical situations, three different demonstrators with increasing complexity are shown: networked robots, unmanned surface vehicles, and a ship-handling simulator.","model inaccuracies,feedback,target positions,trajectory calculation,remotely operated vehicles,maritime navigation filter,model-based optimal trajectories,optimization algorithm,optimal control,LTE,harbor environments,VPN,local trajectory controller,feedback control loop,nonnetworked participant,ships,automatic identification system,autonomous shipping,networked vessels,central computation unit,feedforward,networked control system,virtual private network,AIS,optimisation,position control,rudder,data synchronization step,networked vehicles,networked robots,virtual private networks,maritime applications,networked participant,vehicle states,vessel states,active network participants,optimal maneuvering,trajectory control,unmanned surface vehicles,mobile robots,optimal settings,navigation,marine vehicles,collision avoidance,Long Term Evolution,propulsion units,joint project GALILEOnautic,long term evolution mobile communication,"
"motion modeling and simulation of maritime autonomous surface ships in realistic environmental disturbances","2020","A novel modeling and simulation pipeline is proposed in this paper to predict the six-degrees-of-freedom (6-DOF) motion of MASS under realistic environmental disturbances. The MASS model consists of several physics-based differential equations that are built based on state-of-the-art studies. The onboard sensors are utilized to drive the MASS model to keep the consistent control input with the real ships. A build-in hydrodynamic database describes the motion characteristics of ships. Moreover, an actual sea database is developed based on the third-generation wave numerical model to reproduce the ocean characteristics in the simulation. The spatial-and time-varying environmental vector fields are obtained from the real sea database to ensure consistency with the real environment. Three real voyage cases are reproduced by the presented method. The simulation results are compared with the records from onboard sensors for validation. The RMSE of the simulated trajectories is 3.789', 3.110', and 1.318' under the single influence of disturbances due to the inappropriate description of the real sea. Under the coupling disturbances, the RMSE of trajectories reduces to 0.1829', 0.5249', and 0.4030'. Consequently, the results indicate that the ocean database accurately reflected the ocean characteristics realistically, and the presented method can effectively predict the motions of the real ship under the actual sea environmental disturbances.","onboard sensors,control system synthesis,state-of-the-art studies,third-generation wave numerical model,remotely operated vehicles,maritime autonomous surface ships,Marine vehicles,ship,Mathematical model,coupling disturbances,simulated trajectories,spatial- time-varying environmental vector fields,Predictive models,realistic environmental disturbances,ships,differential equations,hydrodynamic database,hydrodynamics,motion control,Databases,Oceans,position control,ocean database,motion modeling,motion characteristics,actual sea environmental disturbances,physics-based differential equations,Hydrodynamics,Numerical models,time series,six-degrees-of-freedom,actual sea database,mobile robots,MASS model,marine control,numerical analysis,consistent control input,ocean characteristics,"
"synoptic weather conditions and changing fire regimes in a mediterranean environment","2018","Analysis of global change effects on fire regimes requires evaluations of key processes explaining fire activity at the appropriate spatial and temporal scales. Classifications of the weather conditions prevailing at large continental scales (called “Synoptic Weather Types”, SWT) offer convenient potential proxies for integrating weather-related factors into our understanding of fire regime attributes at regional scales. Here we establish a methodology for identifying the major SWT that lead to wildfires and assessing their influence on fire regime in interaction with other global drivers such as drought events or fire suppression policies. Based on days with fires larger than 50 ha that occurred in Catalonia, a region located in the western Mediterranean Basin, we propose a clustering methodology using data of temperature at 850 hPa, sea level pressure and winds at 925 hPa from the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis dataset covering the whole of western Europe (25–70°N and 20°W–40°E). Our classification method proposes 6 SWT: three that were characterized by synoptic conditions leading to strong winds in the region, two that led to ‘hot and dry’ environments, and one that was not characterized by any strong weather determinants. Fires under ‘hot and dry’ conditions, such as the South intrusion SWT, triggered the bulk of fires and burnt area in the region. Spatial analyses of fire distribution under each SWT revealed markedly different fire-prone locations, opening the possibility for strategic planning of fire management based on local fire regimes. Fires occurring during mild years (wet spring conditions) and under ‘hot-and-dry’ SWTs have been eradicated from the region thanks to enhanced firefighting capability, and fire sizes in dry years have strongly reduced. In contrast, fires occurring under windy situations have not followed the same course of change and have not diminished in incidence over time, and seem to be more difficult to control using current fire suppression strategies. The role of SWT on determining fire regimes and its interaction with fire suppression strategies has a huge potential to help researchers and managers develop better fire analyses based on sound physical grounds and serve to understand and eventually regulate the adverse impacts of fire regime changes in a global change context.","Firefighting,Catalonia,Heat-wave,Drought event,Fire size distribution,Wind-driven fire,Kernel density,"
"maritime situational awareness forensics tools for a common information sharing environment (cise)","2019","CISE stands for Common Information Sharing Environment and refers to an architecture and set of protocols, procedures and services for the exchange of data and information across Maritime Authorities of EU (European Union) Member States (MS's). In the context of enabling the implementation and adoption of CISE by different MS's, EU has funded a number of projects that enable the development of subsystems and adaptors intended to allow MS's to connect and make use of CISE. In this context, the Integrated Systems Laboratory (ISL) has led the development of the corresponding Hellenic and Cypriot CISE by developing a Control, Command & Information (C2I) system that unifies all partial maritime surveillance systems into one National Situational Picture Management (NSPM) system, and adaptors that allow the interconnection of the corresponding national legacy systems to CISE and the exchange of data, information and requests between the two MS's. Furthermore, a set of forensics tools that allow geospatial & time filtering and detection of anomalies, risk incidents, fake MMSIs, suspicious speed changes, collision paths, and gaps in AIS (Automatic Identification System), have been developed by combining motion models, AI, deep learning and fusion algorithms using data from different databases through CISE. This paper briefly discusses these developments within the EU CISE-2020, Hellenic CISE and CY-CISE projects and the benefits from the sharing of maritime data across CISE for both maritime surveillance and security.

"fusion detection algorithm of maritime radar and electro-optical pod for complex sea conditions","2023","In order to improve the perceptual capability of Unmanned Surface Vessels (USVs) in complex sea conditions, a fusion detection algorithm has been developed that combines maritime radar and electro-optical (EO) pod. This algorithm integrates the positional state of the USV, class information of the maritime target obtained through a vision-based target detection algorithm, and processed maritime radar information. By using Gaussian and morphological filtering, the fusion of position state information from the USV, EO pod data, and maritime radar data is achieved. This effectively mitigates the negative impact of environmental factors, such as waves and water mist, on target detection. A cooperative sensing process between the maritime radar and EO pod is proposed to fuse the data obtained from both sources, resulting in accurate comprehensive target information. Experimental results show that the fusion algorithm achieves an average accuracy of 80.24% and a detection rate of 74.7%, enabling precise detection of maritime targets, including their distance, speed, and category. This enhanced perceptual capability is essential for USVs operating in complex maritime environments, enabling better decision-making and navigation performance.","maritime radar data,class information,accurate comprehensive target information,sensor fusion,marine radar,electro-optical pod,vision-based target detection algorithm,fusion algorithm,enhanced perceptual capability,target detection,complex maritime environments,positional state,combines maritime radar,fusion detection algorithm,object detection,complex sea conditions,Collaboration,synergistic sensing,Surface morphology,Radar,position state information,Unmanned Surface Vessels,unmanned surface vehicles,detection rate,maritime radar information,Radar imaging,USVs operating,Object detection,Signal processing algorithms,EO pod,maritime target,multi-sensor fusion,Radar detection,"
"gnss-free maritime navigation using radar and digital elevation models","2020","Modern maritime navigation is heavily dependent on satellite systems. Availability of an accurate position is critical for safe operations, but satellite-based navigation systems are vulnerable to interference, jamming, and spoofing. In this work, we propose a method for maritime navigation independent of GNSS, able to provide absolute positioning of the vessel based on marine radar scans. A measurement model is presented where a Digital Elevation Model is used to predict the output of a marine radar, given a hypothetical position. The model, as used by an on-line particle filter, is used to track the movements of a ship from real recorded data. This demonstrates the feasibility of this method for robust positioning, without the need of external positioning signals, in a maritime environment. The tracking only uses sensors commonly available on maritime vessels, and demonstrates its application using freely available elevation data.","on-line particle filter,marine radar,GNSS-free maritime navigation,digital elevation models,absolute vessel positioning,maritime vessels,marine navigation,external positioning signals,Simultaneous localization and mapping,ships,freely available elevation data,modern maritime navigation,particle filtering (numerical methods),Particle measurements,Atmospheric measurements,Radar cross-sections,elevation model,radar signal processing,radar tracking,marine radar scans,maritime environment,robust positioning,hypothetical position,particle filter,navigation,ship movement tracking,satellite-based navigation systems,measurement model,oceanographic techniques,"
"generating bunkering statistics from ais data: a machine learning approach","2021","In shipping, the optimization of the bunkering location is dependent on price, deviation from the planned route and the cost of delays incurred by the bunkering operation itself. Despite their potential importance, detailed statistics for bunkering operations at the individual port call level (e.g. waiting times, barge capacity, location - anchorage or terminal) are not available. I develop a new method, based on the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm, that can a) identify tanker vessels used as bunkering tankers, b) detect stationary ocean-going vessels at anchorage or alongside terminals and c) automatically recognize bunkering operations as a rendezvous between an ocean-going vessel and a bunkering barge. I find that the high time complexity of the DBSCAN algorithm in this setting can be compensated by adjusting the algorithm to distributed computer settings. In the empirical study, I use the output to describe the relative importance of Mediterranean ports for bunkering and provide statistics on waiting and servicing times. The empirical findings are important for the optimization of the bunkering location decision in shipping and studies on regional port competitiveness.","Bunkering operations,Bunkering statistics,DBSCAN,Machine learning,Spatial recognition,"
"a ship movement classification based on automatic identification system (ais) data using convolutional neural network","2020","With a wide use of AIS data in maritime transportation, there is an increasing demand to develop algorithms to efficiently classify a ship’s AIS data into different movements (static, normal navigation and manoeuvring). To achieve this, several studies have been proposed to use labelled features but with the drawback of not being able to effectively extract the details of ship movement information. In addition, a ship movement is in a free space, which is different to a road vehicle’s movement in road grids, making it inconvenient to directly migrate the methods for GPS data classification into AIS data. To deal with these problems, a Convolutional Neural Network-Ship Movement Modes Classification (CNN-SMMC) algorithm is proposed in this paper. The underlying concept of this method is to train a neural network to learn from the labelled AIS data, and the unlabelled AIS data can be effectively classified by using this trained network. More specifically, a Ship Movement Image Generation and Labelling (SMIGL) algorithm is first designed to convert a ship’s AIS trajectories into different movement images to make a full use of the CNN’s classification ability. Then, a CNN-SMMC architecture is built with a series of functional layers (convolutional layer, max-pooling layer, dense layer etc.) for ship movement classification with seven experiments been designed to find the optimal parameters for the CNN-SMMC. Considering the imbalanced features of AIS data, three metrics (average accuracy, F1 score and Area Under Curve (AUC)) are selected to evaluate the performance of the CNN-SMMC. Finally, several benchmark classification algorithms (K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Decision Tree (DT)) are selected to compare with CNN-SMMC. The results demonstrate that the proposed CNN-SMMC has a better performance in the classification of AIS data.","Trajectory image,AUtomatic Identification System (AIS),Ship movement classification,Convolutional Neural Network (CNN),"
"some aspects of the problem of geochemical methods of prospecting for concealed mineralization","1973","This paper describes a number of different geochemical approaches to the search for concealed ore deposits. The first approach discussed is a broad one that relates mineralization to the types of rock that may occur in a region. Attention is focussed on hydrothermal deposits and their association with specific types of igneous rocks and their differentiation trends. A second considers the control of the structure and physico-chemical properties of the host rocks on the localization of ore bodies. A number of factors, such as effective and total porosity and the brittleness of rocks also plays an important role in determining the nature and extent of dispersion haloes of the elements around ore deposits. In some instances it is possible to predict the presence of ore bodies at depth from the type of composition of metasomatized rocks that occur at the surface. The use of mercury and fluorine in the search for concealed deposits has been given detailed consideration. Methods based on fluorine may be effective in the discovery of skarn, greisen, hydrothermal and rare metal deposits. When using the fluorine content of waters from a taiga-permafrost terrain, it is important to consider the effect of the organic content of the water. In searching for Cu-Ni deposits of the Noril'sk type it is suggested that intrusive complexes characterized by high degrees of differentiation and containing picritic and taxitic facies enriched in Mg, Ni and Co and depleted in alkalis are the most prospective. Ore deposits of this type may have dispersion haloes of Ag, Bi, Zn and Pb which are associated with ore-controlling faults. Magnesian and calcareous skarns, feldspathic and serpentine-chlorite-prehnite rocks may form broad contact haloes with ore-bearing intrusions. The use of gases in prospecting for Cu-Mo deposits in Central Kazakhstan have been investigated with positive results. Gas surveys carried out in conjunction with geophysical methods makes it possible to distinguish zones of Cu-Mo mineralization from zones containing pyrite and carbonaceous material, all of which give similar geophysical responses. The occurrences of uranium in aquifers on the flanks of artesian basins within arid regions is used as an example of the use of geochemical zonation in prospecting. The same approach may be used in prospecting for copper-bearing sandstones.",""

"feature disentanglement learning model for ocean temperature field forecast","2023","With the development of sensor technology, data-driven modeling methods for physical oceanography have boomed. Existing deep learning studies lack interpretability from the physical mechanisms. This paper proposes a novel feature disentanglement learning model for the ocean temperature field forecast. In this method, feature disentanglement is adopted to decompose the high-dimensional measured temperature information based on Tucker decomposition. The extracted dynamic feature is filtered and predicted by incremental dynamic learning, and the incremental data information is balanced by maximizing the Gaussian likelihood. Then, the dynamic feature can be entangled with the stable features to predict the ocean temperature field. Last, incremental residual learning can compensate for the feature disentanglement learning error. Experiments on the temperature dataset of the Western Pacific have verified that the proposed method is superior to the existing baselines.","Residual learning,Partial differential equation,Physical oceanography,Feature disentanglement,Incremental learning,"

"a novel technique to identify ais transmissions from vessels which attempt to obscure their position by switching their ais transponder from normal transmit power mode to low transmit power mode","2022","Automatic Identification Systems (AIS) are transponder systems installed on marine vessels which transmit the location, speed and other vessel details. These signals are received by shore side AIS Base stations. The use of AIS is mandatory under international SOLAS regulations for certain categories of vessels. AIS is used to monitor for pollution, search and rescue (SAR) and illegal fishing activity. Some vessel operators deliberately interfere with their AIS transponders, including spoofing their real position or switching their AIS transponder to low transmit power, to reduce the likelihood of being detected but still being in compliance with SOLAS regulations. This might suggest that they are involved in nefarious activity. This paper presents a technique to detect vessels which are switching their Class-A, AIS transponders from normal transmit power to low transmit power mode, by utilising the Received Signal strength Indicator field (RSSI) that the receiving Base Station tags incoming AIS messages with. The technique presented, analyses received RSSI in combination with predicted RSSI values via mathematical modelling and presents a unique detection algorithm. Data from the Irish National AIS was used for the study. Although only a small amount of testing was carried out, results showed that for a test vessel which switched its transponder to low power transmit mode, it was found that a specific drop in RSSI of approximately 10 dBm (decibel-milliwatts) was detectable for different distances from the receiving base station.","AIS spoofing,Received signal strength indicator,Low transmit power,Sybil attack,Automatic identification system,"

"long-term trends in submicron particle concentrations in a metropolitan area of the northeastern united states","2018","Significant changes in emission sources have occurred in the northeastern United States over the past decade, due in part to the implementation of emissions standards, the introduction and addition of abatement technologies for road transport, changes in fuel sulfur content for road and non-road transport, as well as economic impacts of a major recession and differential fuel prices. These changes in emission scenarios likely affected the concentrations of airborne submicron particles. This study investigated the characteristics of 11–500nm particle number concentrations and their size spectra in Rochester, NY during the past 15years (2002 to 2016). The modal structure, diurnal, weekly and monthly patterns of particle number concentrations are analyzed. Long-term trends are quantified using seasonal-trend decomposition procedures based on “Loess”, Mann-Kendall regression with Theil-Sen slope and piecewise regression. Particle concentrations underwent significant (p<0.05) downward trends. An annual decrease of −323particles/cm3/y (−4.6%/y) was estimated for the total particle number concentration using Theil-Sen analysis. The trends were driven mainly by the decrease in particles in the 11–50nm range (−181particles/cm3/y; −4.7%/y). Slope changes were investigated annually and seasonally. Piecewise regression found different slopes for different portions of the overall period with the strongest declines between 2005 and 2011/2013, followed by small upward trends between 2013 and 2016 for most size bins, possibly representing increased vehicular traffic after the recovery from the 2008 recession.","Number concentration,Sources,Trends,Ultrafine particles,"

"timing of major forest compositional changes and tree expansions in the retezat mts during the last 16,000 years","2018","This paper focuses on the Late Glacial (LG) and Holocene regional and local establishment times of several tree and shrub species in the Retezat Mountains (South Carpathians) using pollen, stomata and plant macrofossil records from four lakes situated at different altitudes. We used the empirical and rational pollen percentage limits to infer the local presence and population expansion/recession times. Our results show that Pinus mugo and P. sylvestris spread first at 15,100 cal yr BP in the mountain. P. mugo arrived at high altitudes (1740 m) already at 13,600 cal yr BP. The expansion of Larix decidua was weakly recorded in the pollen diagrams, but the plant macrofossil and stomata records suggested its Late Glacial expansion mainly on the northern slope and local presence since 14,900 cal yr BP at 1740 m. The species likely went extinct in the Late Holocene (around 3330 cal yr BP). The expansion of Picea abies and Ulmus commenced earlier on the southern slope, from 15,200 to 14,400 cal yr BP respectively, compared to the northern slope, where these species expanded from 14,300 to 13,850 cal yr BP. The following step was the expansion of Quercus at 13,900 cal yr BP. Following the Younger Dryas decrease of temperate deciduous taxa and P. abies, their expansion on the northern flank was in the order of P. abies (11,750), Ulmus (11,600), Quercus (11,100), Corylus (10,600), Carpinus betulus (7100), Abies alba (5100) and Fagus sylvatica (5000 cal yr BP). Timing of the Early Holocene tree expansions on the southern flank is ambiguous due to uncertainties in the Early Holocene age-depth model of Lake Lia; however, the mid-Holocene expansion of C. betulus and A. alba were well-dated in both southern slope pollen records to 7700 and 6100 cal yr BP, respectively, and we inferred several hundred years earlier expansion on the southern flank that can be explained by climatic differences. Higher solar radiation results in longer growing seasons and milder winters on the southern flank, which likely facilitated the earlier spread of these trees. For several woody taxa studied in this paper, last glacial maximum refugial populations can be inferred either locally in the mountain (P. abies, P. mugo, P. sylvestris, L. decidua) or in the region (Quercus, Ulmus, C. betulus, F. sylvatica) on the basis of their pollen presence since at least 15,700–16,000 cal yr BP and early increase during the LG. We compared the pollen inferred population expansion times of several tree taxa along a south-north transect in the Romanian Carpathians, and found that the Early Holocene high altitude expansion of A. alba (10,650–9400 cal yr BP) is exceptional in the region. We also demonstrated that the Holocene mass expansion of Quercus and C. avellana started earliest in the Retezat, and at least two centuries later in other sites in the Romanian Carpathians. We also demonstrated that certain tree species had preference for survival and/or early expansion on the northern slopes (A. alba, L. decidua, F. sylvatica), while others on the southern slopes (C. avellana, C. betulus).","Postglacial forest succession,Plant macrofossils,Expansion times,Carpathian Mountains,Pollen analysis,"
"an ecosystem-based approach to evaluate the ecological quality of mediterranean undersea caves","2015","A theoretical model of structure and functioning was constructed for the Mediterranean undersea cave ecosystem. This model integrates almost all representative components of the cave ecosystem and gives an idea of their faunal compositions, characteristics and related interactions. This model constitutes the basis of the Ecosystem-Based Quality Index (EBQI) of the European Union's Marine Strategy Framework Directive, which aims at evaluating the ecological quality of an ecosystem. It is based on four crucial complementary elements: (i) each component was weighted in accordance with its importance in determining the structure and functioning of the cave ecosystem; (ii) a suite of relevant parameters were defined to assess the ecological state of each component of the cave ecosystem; (iii) these parameters were aggregated into one relevant index, the Cave EBQI (CavEBQI), to summarize the quality evaluation for each cave site; (iv) each value of ecological state is accompanied by a Confidence Index as a measure of its reliability. The CavEBQI was used on 22 Mediterranean undersea caves of France and Italy. Disparities of ecological quality were found among caves but most of them ranged from moderate to high ecological quality. For some caves, no conclusion can be drawn when our method predicts a poor reliability of the evaluation of their ecological quality. This ecosystem-based evaluation of the quality of undersea caves seems to be a powerful tool, with the advantage of being based on almost all its components, rather than just on a few species. It is accompanied by a measure of its reliability, hence it provides a reliable idea of the ecological state of the entire ecosystem at each cave site. Monitoring the ecological state of caves and the effects of disturbances over large geographic and temporal scales is made possible with CavEBQI. Applying the same method to other ecosystems, can provide an integrated view of a marine region, which is essential when addressing questions about protection, conservation and restoration.","Mediterranean Sea,Ecological quality,Marine Strategy Framework Directive,Underwater marine caves,Undersea caves,Ecosystem-based quality index,"
"estimation of dipole magnetic moment orientation based on magnetic signature waveform analysis by a magnetic sensor","2020","In this paper, we propose a measurement procedure to estimate the magnetic moment orientation (MMO) of a dipole. Theoretical analysis indicates that magnetic field in each orthogonal direction Bi (i = x, y, z) is found to be a superposition of its three basic elements Bij (i = x, y, z and j = 1, 2, 3) along certain direction, allowing the obtained dipole signature to be decomposed of 9 basic elements. An orthogonal energy ratio (OER) algorithm is used to infer the MMO by calculating the signal energy distribution along each axis. A standard OER database is developed which provides a reference to be compared with the measured OER. The one having the smallest variance is determined as the estimated MMO. Owing to space symmetric property, it generally introduces 8 possible solutions. Then, a mathematic method is presented to define the common characteristics of the magnetic signature in the 8 octants, which is able to identify the octant of unknown target based on detected Bi field. As a result, the unique MMO can be estimated. The experimental results show good estimation accuracy for the dipole orientation with average error of 3.5°. In particular, the algorithm is independent of changing CPA and velocity, which is demonstrated in simulation and experiment.","Magnetic moment,Magnetic anomaly signature,Estimation,"
"magnetotaxis☆","2019","One of the most conspicuous tactic behaviors of bacteria other than chemo- and phototaxis is magnetotaxis. Although microbes other than bacteria may exhibit magnetotaxis, it is most well recognized and studied in bacteria. Magnetotactic bacteria are Gram-negative, mostly aquatic, motile prokaryotes that biomineralize intracellular magnetic crystals of the iron oxide magnetite and/or iron sulfide minerals (greigite and precursors). Each crystal is enveloped by a lipid-bilayer membrane and comprises the organelle referred to as the magnetosome. Magnetosomes are usually organized in chains within the cell and cause the bacterium to orient and swim along the Earth's geomagnetic field lines, being propelled by flagella. Microorganisms apparently use the Earth's magnetic field to increase the efficiency of chemotaxis in locating and maintaining an optimal position in vertical chemical and redox gradients. Magnetotactic bacteria are indigenous in sediments or water columns where they occur predominantly at the oxic–anoxic interface and the anoxic zone. They represent a diverse group of microorganisms with respect to morphology, physiology, and phylogeny. Many potential biotechnological, medical and commercial applications of magnetosomes and their magnetic crystals have been recognized.","Magnetotactic bacteria,Astrobiology,Magnetospirillum,Magneto-aerotaxis,Redoxtaxis,Biomineralization,Magnetotaxis,Magnetosome,"

"tightly coupled, graph-based dvl/imu fusion and decoupled mapping for slam-centric maritime infrastructure inspection","2023","In this article, we address the problem of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM)-centric maritime infrastructure inspection [using unmanned surface vehicles (USVs)] via novel approaches in tightly-coupled, graph-based DVL/IMU fusion and decoupled mapping. As our first contribution, we formalize the preintegration of linear velocity measurements, obtained by a Doppler velocity log (DVL), in combination with angular velocity measurements, obtained by an inertial measurement unit (IMU), as binary factors encoding relative position. To evaluate state estimation improvements imparted by DVL/IMU fusion, we implement our proposed factor within a state-of-the-art, graph-based lidar-visual-inertial (LVI) SLAM system as our second contribution. Accuracy and robustness improvements are demonstrated in simulation by comparing maximum a posteriori pose estimates with and without DVL/IMU fusion against ground truth poses. As our third contribution, we propose a map generation framework for downstream inspection applications decoupled from SLAM. In our framework, volumetric data (captured by sonar, lidar, etc.) is transformed into a common world coordinate frame using extrinsic calibrations and SLAM pose estimates as input. Our framework operates over the complete set of raw volumetric data, whereas SLAM systems (both online and offline) typically operate over a subset of down-sampled volumetric data. To address the processing of additional volumetric data, we present innovations in refined pose correction and staged filtering for user-controlled denoising. We experimentally evaluate our map generation framework against the LVI SLAM system adopted for this study using real-world data and demonstrate improvements to map quality metrics important to inspection.","decoupled mapping,sensor fusion,Inspection,robot vision,unmanned surface vehicles (USVs),SLAM (robots),LVI SLAM system,Sea measurements,Laser radar,Doppler velocity log,SLAM systems,inspection,pose estimation,Simultaneous localization and mapping,angular velocity measurements,inertial measurement unit,graph-based lidar-visual-inertial SLAM system,state estimation,map generation framework,SLAM-centric maritime infrastructure inspection,mapping,Sonar,optical radar,Robustness,map quality metrics,state estimation improvements,unmanned surface vehicles,calibration,Velocity measurement,mobile robots,downstream inspection applications,linear velocity measurements,simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM),velocity measurement,"
"the electrification of the atmosphere by particles from bubbles in the sea","1963","The work in this paper has been directed towards an evaluation of the quantity of electric charge that is separated at the surface of the sea. As the carriers of the charge are particles that arise from the sea by wind and wave action, it was necessary to determine first the flux of particles across the sea and the manner in which the particles originated. Then, laboratory studies were carried out to determine the sign and magnitude of the particle charge. The data from these two separate investigations were combined to obtain an estimate of the charge separation by the world ocean. It was concluded that a majority of the particles that arise from the sea evolve from bubbles that break at the sea surface. These particles come from both the bubble film and the breakdown of a jet which rises at high speeds from the bottom of the collapsing bubble cavity. The film drop flux was computed directly from a knowledge of the world ocean white-cap coverage. The flux of jet drops, on the other hand, was computed indirectly, first by assuming a steady state between the source and the sink of the jet drops and then by computing their fall-out rate by sedimentation, rain washout, and advection over the continents. The charge on the film drops was obtained with a Millikan-continuous diffusion cloud chamber and that on the jet drops by a modified Millikan chamber. The charge Q (esu) on the top jet drop from sea water was found to be positive and a function of both drop radius R (microns) and bubble age T (sec). For bubbles of an age of less than 10 sec this charge can be approximated by the expression Q = 1.76 × 10−8T0.4R1.3. The world ocean charge flow that is carried by film drops was found to be negligible, being far less than 1A. That carried by jet drops, however, was calculated to be about 160 A. This is about 17 per cent of the magnitude of the air-earth current over the world ocean that has been attributed to thunderstorm activity. The jet drop charge flux has been determined for both the winter and summer seasons and as a function of latitude. In both hemispheres and in both seasons the oceanic charge separation attains a maximum at latitudes of 40 to 60° and reaches its highest value of 3.2 × 10−7 esu cm−2 sec−1 at about 50° S. latitude in June–August. Two factors that may modify both the jet drop size and its charge were considered in detail. The first is that of organic surface-active films on the surface of the ocean. Experiments showed that the removal of surface films by jet drops was a function of bubble size and suggested that most of the drops that take part in the charge transfer are sufficiently small that they do not carry away any of the surface-active film. The reason for this appears to be that the small drops from the jets bubbles evolve so rapidly that the surface film does not have time to move into the collapsing bubble cavity and to cover the jet. Calculation showed that the drop ejection velocity was an inverse function of bubble size and attained a value of several thousand centimeters per second for drops from the smaller bubbles. The question of surface films at sea was discussed, and it was shown that one has reason to suspect that film collapse by wind and surface water convergences might prevent them from covering a significant area of the ocean. For these reasons it was concluded that the effects of surface films on the computed charge production were of no significance. The second factor that could modify the jet drop charge is the induction charging that is caused by the earth's electric field, normally 1 V cm−1 at the surface of the sea. This factor, however, was found to be of no great significance, as experiment indicated that the amount of induction charging by such small electric fields was less than 5 per cent of that charge which the drops carried in the absence of a field. Evidence for the 160 A positive current from the world ocean was drawn from two sources. The first, that of space charge measurements in air that had passed over the sea where a great deal of bubbling was occurring, indicated that a net positive space charge was carried by the drops that left the sea in this region. The second source gave evidence that was suggestive though not conclusive. It was shown that the latitudinal distribution of the oceanic electric field had two maxima, one in each hemisphere, in the same latitudes as did the computed oceanic charge separation. But it could not be proved that the oceanic charge separation caused the latitudinal variation in the electric field, for it was shown that such variation could conceivably come about by an appropriate latitudinal variation of the convection current. Finally, it was suggested that the jet drop charge arises from a charge separation of the electric double layer that surrounds the bubble. This separation is thought to be a consequence of laminar shear flow within the rising jet with the result that the water that constitutes the faster moving, positively charged core of the jet ends up as a positively charged jet drop.",""
"intelligent maritime surveillance framework driven by fusion of camera-based vessel detection and ais data","2022","Efficient maritime surveillance is necessary for navigation, which usually uses cameras to capture the vessels. However, the information in camera-based data is limited. In this work, we propose a novel intelligent maritime surveillance framework driven by the fusion of camera-based vessel detection and Automatic Identification System (AIS) data. Firstly, we employ a vessel detection network to get the relative positions of the vessels from the calibrated camera-based data. Meanwhile, we design a series of filters based on data completeness, detection range, and vessel course to exclude the invalid AIS data. In the end, we propose a data fusion module based on estimating the time when the vessel arrive at the specific position. According to the experiment on our collected dataset, the proposed framework performs competitively in diversified scenes.

"dominant mechanisms for the delivery of fine sediment and phosphorus to fluvial networks draining grassland dominated headwater catchments","2015","Recent advances in monitoring technology have enabled high frequency, in-situ measurements of total phosphorus and total reactive phosphorus to be undertaken with high precision, whilst turbidity can provide an excellent surrogate for suspended sediment. Despite these measurements being fundamental to understanding the mechanisms and flow paths that deliver these constituents to river networks, there is a paucity of such data for headwater agricultural catchments. The aim of this paper is to deduce the dominant mechanisms for the delivery of fine sediment and phosphorus to an upland river network in the UK through characterisation of the temporal variability of hydrological fluxes, and associated soluble and particulate concentrations for the period spanning March 2012–February 2013. An assessment of the factors producing constituent hysteresis is undertaken following factor analysis (FA) on a suite of measured environmental variables representing the fluvial and wider catchment conditions prior to, and during catchment-wide hydrological events. Analysis indicates that suspended sediment is delivered to the fluvial system predominantly via rapidly responding pathways driven by event hydrology. However, evidence of complex, figure-of-eight hysteresis is observed following periods of hydrological quiescence, highlighting the importance of preparatory processes. Sediment delivery via a slow moving, probably sub-surface pathway does occur, albeit infrequently and during low magnitude events at the catchment outlet. Phosphorus is revealed to have a distinct hysteretic response to that of suspended sediment, with sub-surface pathways dominating. However, high magnitude events were observed to exhibit threshold-like behaviour, whereby activation and connection of usually disconnected depositional zones to the fluvial networks results in the movement of vast phosphorus fluxes. Multiple pathways are observed for particulate and soluble constituents, highlighting the challenges faced in mitigating the delivery of contaminant fluxes to headwater river systems.","Connectivity,Grassland,Suspended sediment,Fluvial,Water quality,Phosphorus,Headwater,Diffuse pollution,"

"geochemical, mineralogical, and petrological characteristics of the cretaceous coal from the middle benue trough basin, nigeria: implication for coal depositional environments","2022","The Benue Trough Basin (BTB) of Nigeria is geologically and geo-morphologically subdivided into upper, middle, and lower segments. The BTB is the subject of geological research due to its rich coal deposits that have the potential for oil and gas. The purpose of the present study is to examine the origins, depositional environments, and thermal history of the selected coals and the processes that influence their quality. Coal samples from different open cast coal mines in the middle BTB were examined using proximate and ultimate, x-ray diffraction (XRD), x-ray fluorescence (XRF), laser ablation induced coupled plasma (LA-ICPMS), and petrographical analyses. The coal samples contained mainly quartz, kaolinite, and organic carbon. The XRD spectra peaks revealed the triclinic and monoclinic structure of kaolin. The SiO2/Al2O3 ratios confirmed the dominance of quartz and kaolinite. The Ni/Co versus V/Cr, Cu/Zn, and V/Mo values in the studied coals suggest oxic depositional environments, whereas the V/(Ni + V) and V/(V + Cr) values indicate oxic to suboxic conditions. The Ce/Ce∗ values are slightly below 1, which indicates a suboxic depositional environment. Maceral texture is indicative of transformations from sub-bituminous to high volatile C or B bituminous coal. The maceral components and mineral matter (≥10%) of the studied coals imply deposition in the planar margin mire, and a river system of planar margin mire environments, respectively. The high gelification index (GI) and tissue preservation index (TPI) values indicate peat accumulation developed within a wet forest swamp. The ternary diagram of the maceral component suggests deposition in a wet moor environment with intermittent moderate to high flooding episodes. The studied coals are sub-hydrous vitrinite inferring hydrogen-poor and thermally immature characteristics. The low V and Ni contents, low H/C and high O/C, indicate Type Ⅲ terrestrial organic matter with the potential to generate gaseous hydrocarbons. The investigated coals were deposited by the river within telmatic, limnic, and limno-telmatic zones in the planar margin mire depositional environments. Overall, the integrated petrologic and geochemical data used in this study provides a reliable approach for the assessment of coal depositional environments.","Mineralogy,Coal,Depositional environments,Maceral,Trace elements,"
"long-range dependence in north atlantic sea level","2006","Sea level is an important parameter in climate and oceanographic applications. In this work the scaling behavior of sea level is analyzed from time series of sea level observations. The wavelet domain is particularly attractive for the identification of scaling behavior in an observed time series. The wavelet spectrum from a scale-by-scale wavelet analysis of variance reproduces in the wavelet domain the power laws underlying a scaling process, allowing the estimation of the scaling exponent from the slope of the wavelet spectrum. Here the scaling exponent is estimated in the wavelet domain for time series of sea level observations in the North Atlantic: at coastal sites from tide gauges, covering 50 years of monthly measurements, and in the open ocean from satellite altimetry, covering 12 years of satellite measurements at 10 days intervals. Both tide gauge and altimetry time series exhibit scaling behavior. Furthermore, the degree of stochastic persistence is spatially coherent and distinct at the coast and in the open ocean. Near the coast, the stochastic structure of the sea level observations is characterized by long-range dependence with a moderate degree of persistence. Larger values of the scaling exponent, consistent with weaker persistence, are concentrated in the northern Atlantic. At mid-latitudes the stochastic dependence of sea level observations is characterized by strong persistence in the form of strong long-range and 1/f dependence.","Scaling,North Atlantic,Sea level,Wavelet methods,"
"a novel adamts17 variant that causes weill-marchesani syndrome 4 alters fibrillin-1 and collagen type i deposition in the extracellular matrix","2020","Weill-Marchesani syndrome (WMS) is a rare genetic disorder that affects the musculoskeletal system, the eye, and the cardiovascular system. Individuals with WMS present with short stature, joint contractures, thick skin, microspherophakia, small and dislocated lenses, and cardiac valve anomalies. WMS can be caused by recessive mutations in ADAMTS10 (WMS 1), ADAMTS17 (WMS 4), or LTBP2 (WMS 3), or by dominant mutations in fibrillin-1 (FBN1) (WMS 2); all genes encode secreted extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. Individuals with WMS 4 due to ADAMTS17 mutations appear to have less severe cardiac involvement and present predominantly with the musculoskeletal and ocular features of WMS. ADAMTS17 is a member of the ADAMTS family of secreted proteases and directly binds to fibrillins. Here we report a novel pathogenic variant in ADAMTS17 that causes WMS 4 in an individual with short stature, brachydactyly, and small, spherical, and dislocated lenses. We provide biochemical and cell biological insights in the pathomechanisms of WMS 4, which also suggest potential biological functions for ADAMTS17. We show that the variant in ADAMTS17 prevents its secretion and we found intracellular accumulation of fibrillin-1 and collagen type I in patient-derived skin fibroblasts. In accordance, transmission electron microscopy revealed elastic fiber abnormalities, decreased collagen fibril diameters, and intracellular collagen accumulation in the dermis of the proband. Together, the data indicate a possible role for ADAMTS17 in the secretion of fibrillin-1 and collagen type I or in their early assembly in the pericellular matrix or the ECM.",""

We found that policy directions for ports to contribute to the development and implementation of the PI lie within the areas of transport infrastructure, (PI) standardization, advanced terminal areas, ICT hardware, information systems (IS) and platforms, and sustainability management.","international trade,PI,maritime,logistics R&D,transport hubs,Freight transport,transportation,Stakeholders,organisational aspects,logistics,Containers,loading material,information systems,open information exchange,Seaports,sea ports,innovation management,Real-time systems,Logistics,packaging material,freight transport,maritime ports,system-wide optimization,freight handling,Physical Internet (PI),ports,Internet,technological innovation,Technological innovation,production engineering computing,Physical Internet,organizational innovation,"
"chapter 10 - on the use of evolutionary algorithms for localization and mapping: infrastructure monitoring in smart cities via miniaturized autonomous sensory agents","2019","Miniaturized autonomous sensory agents (MASAs) can play a pivotal role in smart cities of tomorrow. From monitoring underground infrastructure such as pollution in water pipes, to exploration of natural resources such as oil and gas. These smart agents will not only detect anomalies, they are expected to provide sufficient data to facilitate mapping the detected anomalies, while—cleverly—adopting their behavior based on the changes presented in the environment. However, given these objectives and due to MASA’s miniaturization, conventional designing methods are not suitable to design MASA. On one hand, it is not possible to use the widely adopted simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) schemes, because of the hardware limitations on-board of MASA. Furthermore, the targeted environments for MASA in a smart city are typically GPS-denied, hardly accessible, and either completely or partially unknown. Furthermore, designing MASA’s hardware and their autonomous on-line behavior presents an additional challenge. In this chapter, we present a framework dubbed as evolutionary localization and mapping (EVOLAM), which uses multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) to tackle the design and algorithmic challenges in using MASAs in monitoring infrastructure. This framework facilitates offline localization and mapping, while adaptively tuning offline hardware constraints and online behavior. In addition, we present different types of MOEAs that can be used within the framework. Finally, we project EVOLAM on a case-study, thus highlighting MOEA effectiveness in solving different complex localization and mapping problems.","Miniaturized autonomous sensory agents,Localization,Evolutionary computation,Mapping,Infrastructure monitoring,"
"unsupervised maritime traffic pattern extraction from spatio-temporal data","2015","Maritime traffic pattern extraction is a fundamental and crucial factor for maritime surveillance and anomaly detection. Emerging technologies like Automatic Identification System (AIS) provides multi-dimensional data which is used to construct a maritime traffic model. In this paper, we propose a framework of maritime traffic pattern extraction from vessel AIS information, which learns a traffic pattern using an unsupervised technique, and can be applied on historical Automatic Identification System data. AIS data is a kind of spatio-temporal data that contains information of location data, as well as time stamps. In this way, traffic pattern is described by AIS data. Furthermore, we conduct a simulation experiment that extracts traffic pattern from the AIS data through the unsupervised technique. The proposed framework takes advantage of AIS data, which is a type of the spatiotemporal data that consists of vessel motion information, to perform the experiment. The result shows that the unsupervised framework converts useful information from raw AIS data to effective traffic pattern. The proposed method strongly supports the further research on maritime traffic pattern extraction of AIS data. Besides, an overview of the framework and the unsupervised technique for high-level maritime situation awareness is presented.","Traffic control,Clustering algorithms,unsupervised learning,anomaly detection,Marine vehicles,vessel AIS information,spatiotemporal data,data analysis,ships,automatic identification system,marine engineering,Automatic Identification System,maritime traffic pattern,AIS,maritime surveillance,Data models,feature extraction,Classification algorithms,identification,Trajectory,maritime situation awareness,maritime traffic pattern extraction,density-based clustering,Data mining,"
"machine learning-assisted anomaly detection in maritime navigation using ais data","2020","The automatic identification system (AIS) reports vessels' static and dynamic information, which are essential for maritime traffic situation awareness. However, AIS transponders can be switched off to hide suspicious activities, such as illegal fishing, or piracy. Therefore, this paper uses real world AIS data to analyze the possibility of successful detection of various anomalies in the maritime domain. We propose a multi-class artificial neural network (ANN)-based anomaly detection framework to classify intentional and non-intentional AIS on-off switching anomalies. The multi-class anomaly framework captures AIS message dropouts due to various reasons, e.g., channel effects or intentional one for carrying illegal activities. We extract position, speed, course and timing information from real world AIS data, and use them to train a 2-class (normal and anomaly) and a 3-class (normal, power outage and anomaly) anomaly detection models. Our results show that the models achieve around 99.9% overall accuracy, and are able to classify a test sample in the order of microseconds.","security of data,maritime traffic situation awareness,multiclass anomaly framework,pattern classification,multiclass artificial neural network,AIS message dropouts,neural nets,illegal fishing,learning (artificial intelligence),illegal activities,ships,automatic identification system,marine engineering,machine learning-assisted anomaly detection,maritime navigation,AIS transponders,"
"localization of an underwater beacon in task2 of maritime robotx","2019","This paper provides a method to localize an underwater beacon in real-time and overcome the challenge of SNR due to ambient noise and multiple reflections. The signal of beacon is a 4-ms pulse per 0.5 second, 1 second or 2 seconds, and the frequency is 25 to 40 kHz in 0.5 kHz increment. Details of this information is not disclosed until the day of the competition, which adds to the challenges. The algorithm for calculating direction where target signal is coming from is time difference of arrival(TDOA). In order to receive the time difference, we use two hydrophones at two different positions. After getting the time difference, incident angle can be calculated consequently, thus the direction which the target signal is from can be determined.","time-of-arrival estimation,Localization of Underwater Acoustic Source,time 0.5 s,time 2.0 s,maritime RobotX,hydrophones,frequency 25.0 kHz to 40.0 kHz,Oceans,Signal processing,Robots,Time Difference of Arrival,underwater beacon,Logic gates,frequency 0.5 kHz,ambient noise,Underwater acoustics,Sonar equipment,time difference of arrival,target signal,Task analysis,Maritime RobotX,acoustic signal processing,time 1.0 s,multiple reflections,oceanographic techniques,"
"maritime anomaly detection and threat assessment","2010","Ships involved in commercial activities tend to follow set patterns of behaviour depending on the business in which they are engaged. If a ship exhibits anomalous behaviour, this could indicate it is being used for illicit activities. With the wide availability of automatic identification system (AIS) data it is now possible to detect some of these patterns of behaviour. Monitoring the possible threat posed by the worldwide movement of ships, however, requires efficient and robust automatic data processing to create a priority list for further investigation. This paper outlines five anomalous ship behaviours: deviation from standard routes, unexpected AIS activity, unexpected port arrival, close approach, and zone entry. For each behaviour, a process is described for determining the probability that it is anomalous. Individual probabilities are combined using a Bayesian network to calculate the overall probability that a specific threat is present.

"an experimental investigation on damage mechanisms of thick hybrid composite structures under flexural loading using multi-instrument measurements","2021","In this study, damage characterization of thick carbon/glass fiber reinforced hybrid composites is performed under flexural loading conditions via two non-destructive evaluation (NDE) techniques, i.e., digital image correlation (DIC) and acoustic emission (AE). Experimental results demonstrate that the flexural modulus of the hybrid composites is strongly correlated with the location of carbon fiber plies; the closer these plies are to the laminate faces, the higher is the modulus. On the other hand, the flexural strength depends on the type and extent of damage initiation in the laminates. Interply hybridization of carbon fiber reinforced composites (CFRPs) with glass fiber not only improves their flexural strength and failure strain but also facilitates failure predictability in CFRPs. The transverse and shear strains associated with various failure modes in thick hybrid laminates are efficiently captured by the DIC technique. In addition, AE results reveal that the strain levels associated with the onset of acoustic activity are linked to failure in the carbon fiber plies of the hybrid laminates. Furthermore, these observations made by DIC and AE on thick hybrid laminates are confirmed with optical fractography. Finally, it is revealed that ply lay-up sequence and laminate thickness notably alter both the mechanical performance and damage mechanisms of hybrid composites.","Damage accumulation,Flexural properties,Digital image correlation,Failure predictability,Thick hybrid composites,Acoustic emission,"
"determination of measuring sites for solar irradiance, based on cluster analysis of satellite-derived cloud estimations","2013","Methods applied on efficient planning of ground-based monitoring networks of surface solar irradiance could provide valuable scientific results and be useful for accurate monitoring and efficient planning of solar energy applications. Based on the dominance of cloud effect on solar irradiance and the advantage of the high spatial resolution of a geostationary satellite, a novel method is presented for optimizing the location of measuring sites for the newly built Hellenic Network of Solar Energy (www.helionet.gr). The k-means algorithm is used for cluster analysis and the validation of the clustering method reveals that the variability of surface solar irradiance due to cloudiness over Greece could be sufficiently monitored with the establishment of 22 ground-based instruments. The spatial representativeness of the proposed sites is also assessed. The proposed number of stations could be considered as the basis to build the climatology of surface solar irradiance over Greece.","Surface solar irradiance,Satellite derived estimations,Ground-based monitoring network,Cluster analysis,"

"the nitrate radical: physics, chemistry, and the atmosphere","1991","This review surveys the present state of knowledge of the nitrate (NO3 radical. Laboratory data on the physics and chemistry of the radical and atmospheric determination of the concentrations of the radical are both considered. One aim of the review is to highlight the relationship between the laboratory and the atmospheric studies. Although the emphasis of the review is on gas-phase processes, relevant studies conducted in condensed phases are mentioned because of their potential importance in the interpretation of cloud and aerosol chemistry. The spectroscopy, structure, and photochemistry of the radical are examined. Here, the object is to establich the spectroscopic basis for detection of the radical and measurement of its concentration in the laboratory and in the atmosphere. Infrared, visible, and paramagnetic resonance spectra are considered. An important quantity discussed is the absorption cross section in the visible region, which is required for quantitative measurements. Interpretation of the spectroscopic features requires an understanding of the geometrical and electronic structure of the radical in its ground and excited states; there is still some controversy about the groundstate geometry, but the most recent experimental evidence 9eg from laser induced fluorescence) and theoretical calculations suggest that the radical has D3h symmetry. Photodissociation of the radical is important in the atmosphere, and the product channels, quantum yields, and dissociation dynamics are discussed. A short examination of the thermodynamics (heat and entropy of formation) of the radical is presented. The main exposition of laboratory studies of the chemistry of the nitrate radical is preceded by a consideration of the techniques used for kinetic and mechanistic studies. Methods for the generation and detection of the radical and the kinetic tools employed are all presented. The exact nature of the technique used in individual studies has some relevance to the way in which data must be analysed, and to the type of mechanistic information that can be extracted. Continuous and stopped flow, flash photolysis and pulse radiolysis, molecular modulation, and static reactor techniques can all provide absolute kinetic data, while relative rate measurements have been a further rich source of information. The treatment of the chemical reactions of the nitrate radical is formally divided into the interactions with non-radical inorganic (deemed to include NO and NO2) and organic species, and with atoms and free radicals. In general, the reactions with open-shell species are much more rapid than those with closed-shell reactants. With the closed-shell partners, addition reactions are faster than abstraction reactions. An attempt is made to consider critically the published data on most reactions of importance, and to tabulate rate constants and temperature dependences where possible. However, it is not the objective of this review to provide recommendations for rate parameters. Evidence for the products of the reactions is sought, and for the branching ratios into the various channels where more than one exists. One theme of this part of the review is the elucidation of correlations of reactivity with structure and with the reactions of other radical species such as OH. The review turns next to a consideration of the role of NO3 in the atmosphere, of its atmospheric sources and sinks, and of field measurements of concentrations of the radical. Long-path visible-absorption spectroscopy and matrix-isolation ESR have both been used successfully in field measurements in the troposphere as well as the stratosphere. Balloon-borne instruments and ground-based remote sensing have been used to obtain stratospheric concentrations. Two of the most important implications of the measurements are that the stratospheric profiles are consistent with accepted chemistry (and, in particular, do not require the postulation of an unidentified scavenging mechanism that had, at one stage, been proposed), and that the highly variable night-time tropospheric concentrations imply that NO3 is a reactive tropospheric constituent. The inter-relation between laboratory studies and atmospheric observations, and the problems in extrapolating laboratory data to atmospheric conditions, are both explored. Initiation of night-time chemical transformations by NO3 and the possible production of OH are considered. The available information is then brought together to see how far NO3 is a sensitive indicator of the state of the atmosphere, and some speculations are presented about the involvement of NO3 (or N2O5) in damage to trees and plants. The final section of the review suggests some issues that remain unresolved concerning the NO3 radical which is directly or indirectly relevant to a better knowledge of the part played by the radical in the atmosphere. Amongst the requirements noted are improved data for the heat of formation of the radical, its absorption cross section in the visible region (and, especially, the temperature dependence of the cross section), and the details of its photochemistry. There is also still a need for a definitive determination of the equilibrium constant and its temperature dependence for the association with NO2 and the reverse dissociation of N2O5. A series of chemical reactions deserves further investigation, especially with regard to elucidation of product channels, and overall oxidation mechanisms also need to be defined better. Future atmospheric studies that are desirable include study of basic NO3 chemistry in the field to understand the influence of humidity on the conversion (probably on surfaces) of N2O5 to HNO3, and thus on NO3 concentrations. In addition, a study of the chemistry of NO3 in the presence of volatile organic compounds and at elevated concentrations of the oxides of nitrogen should help in the understanding of, for example, polluted marine coasts, forests, and urban areas.",""

"holocene stable isotope record of insolation and rapid climate change in a stalagmite from the zagros of iran","2020","We explore Holocene climatic changes recorded by geochemical proxies in a single, well-dated, stalagmite from the northern Zagros Mountains of Iran, a region where stalagmite records have so far only provided short glimpses of Holocene climatic changes. Stalagmite KT-3 from Katalekhor Cave began growing ∼9.5 ka under wet early Holocene conditions coincident with the timing of Sapropel 1. At this time δ18O values were at or below −9.0‰, stalagmite growth diameter was at its maximum, 234U/238U0 activity values were low and trace element contents indicate flushing of the epikarst. Progressive reduction in winter precipitation amount after 7.0 ka, is recorded by increasing δ18O and 234U/238U0 activity values and reduction in trace element contents and growth diameter until ∼2.0 ka. These trends follow the reduction in summer insolation and agree with model-simulated changes in total rainfall and rainwater isotopes. Sub-centennial-scale variability is not a feature of the δ18O or trace element records; this suggests a stable winter recharge regime, a feature that might militate against KT-3 δ18O recording changes in the seasonality of rainfall. KT-3 δ13C compositions are enriched relative to lower altitude stalagmites in the Levant, implying low soil CO2 contribution (thin montane soils). However, a broadly decreasing millennial-scale trend in δ13C suggests that soil carbon contributions increased with time despite the progressive reduction in winter precipitation amount. The δ13C changes probably reflect decreasing summer temperatures and less extreme wintertime coldness, driven by reducing summer- and increasing winter-insolation respectively. These combined effects decreased effective evaporation and improved soil-moisture availability favouring vegetation development during the growth season. The δ13C values also show ∼1.5‰ centennial-scale variability with higher δ13C values between 9.0 and 8.7 ka, 8.3–7.7 ka, 6.5–5.5 ka, 5.4–4.5 ka and ∼4.3–2.0 ka: three of these correspond with Rapid Climate Change (RCC) events based on non-seasalt potassium (K+) in Greenland ice cores. Higher δ13C values indicate poor soil development caused by aridity. The centennial-scale δ13C anomaly (8.3–7.7 ka) is in part overprinted by the ∼160 year-long, 8.2 ka cold/dry event, but culmination ∼7.7 ka corresponds with other records suggesting an intensified Siberian High Pressure system affecting regional climate. The centennial-scale δ13C anomaly between 4.3 and 2.0 ka overlaps the 2.65 to 2.50 ka ‘Assyrian megadrought’ evident in stalagmite stable isotope records in northern Iraq. The KT-3 record is key in better understanding Holocene climate change in the central Zagros region, representative of montane ‘fertile crescent’ environments.","Iran,Zagros,Stable isotopes,Rapid climate change,Holocene,Stalagmite,Paleoclimatology,Trace elements,"

"improving volcanic ash cloud detection by a robust satellite technique","2004","Automated and reliable satellite-based techniques are strongly required for volcanic ash cloud detection and tracking. In fact, volcanic ash clouds pose a serious hazard for air traffic and the synoptic (and possibly frequent) coverage offered by satellites can provide exciting opportunities for monitoring activities as well as for risk mitigation purposes. A new, AVHRR-based technique for improved automatic detection of volcanic clouds by means of multi-temporal analysis of historical, long-term satellite records has been recently proposed. The technique basically rests on the Robust AVHRR Techniques (RAT) approach, which is an innovative strategy of satellite data analysis, devoted to a former characterisation of the measured signal, in terms of expected value and natural variability and a further recognition of signal anomalies by an automatic, unsupervised change detection step. In this work, an extension of this method to nighttime observations is presented, by using thermal infrared information coming from AVHRR bands centred approximately at 3.5, 11.0 and 12.0 μm. Results achieved for two recent eruptive events of Mount Etna (occurred in May 2000 and in July 2001) seem to be encouraging, showing clear improvements in terms of ash detection sensitivity as well as in terms of false alarms reduction. The technique performance is also evaluated by comparison with the traditional “split-window” brightness temperature difference method; this exercise revealed a general improvement obtained by the proposed approach, even though some common problems still remain unsolved. The main merits of such an approach are its intrinsic self-adaptability to different environmental/natural/observational conditions and its natural exportability also to different satellite sensors. The results here presented show the benefits of such a technique especially when different observational conditions (time of pass, seasonal period, atmospheric moisture, solar illumination, volcanic cloud composition, satellite angles of view, etc.) are considered. The future prospects, also in terms of possible operational scenarios, coming from the implementation of such an approach on the new generation of satellite sensors (like, for example, SEVIRI aboard Meteosat Second Generation platform) are also discussed.","Volcanic monitoring from space,Mount Etna,Ash clouds detection/discrimination,Multi-temporal analyses,Robust AVHRR Techniques (RAT),AVHRR,"
"holocene changes in biomass burning in the boreal northern hemisphere, reconstructed from anhydrosugar fluxes in an arctic sediment profile","2023","The rapid warming of Arctic is causing increased fire activities in the boreal Northern Hemisphere (NH), leading to unprecedent changes in the global carbon cycling, human health and ecosystems. Understanding the interaction between fire and climate in this far north region is crucial for predicting future changes of wildfires. However, fire records over geological time scales are still scarce in the high latitudes of NH to provide comprehensive pictures of the fire history in this region. Here, we used the flux of levoglucosan (Lev) and its isomers in a sediment profile YN from Svalbard, high Arctic, as proxies for the changes in biomass burning from ∼9–2 kyr BP (thousand years before present). Backward trajectories and comparison with charcoal syntheses from various regions confirmed that the Lev transport to the profile site is sourced from the fire activities in the boreal NH, especially in northern Europe and northern Siberia. The Lev flux exhibited a slight overall decreasing trend at ∼3 %/kyr (p = 0.09) over the study period, as well as centennial maxima at ∼9, 8–7, 6, 5, and 4–3 kyr BP (p = 0.06). On sub-orbital scales, the long-term decrease in fire activities corresponded to trends of summer temperature in the extratropics of the NH (p = 0.01, r = 0.42), reflecting their regulation of fuel availability and flammability. On centennial to sub-millennial time scales, high levels of biomass burning were associated with periods of increased North Atlantic ice-rafted debris (p = 0.02, r = 0.38), which were indicative of cold and dry conditions over most of the source regions, reflecting the impacts of dryness on fuel flammability. The results suggested that enhanced Arctic amplification on centennial time scales may reduce biomass burning in most of the boreal NH, although fires in some mid-latitude regions may be facilitated.","Fire history,Anhydrosugar,Ny-Ålesund,Levoglucosan,Holocene,Arctic,Climate change,Northern Hemisphere,"
"diagnosing the spatiotemporal diversity of westerly wind events in the tropical pacific","2019","Westerly Wind Events (WWEs) over the tropical Pacific are characterized by their spatiotemporal diversity and classified into six types based on their different locations and durations. Various types of WWEs exhibit quite different characteristics in terms of their amplitudes. The long events with a 10–30-day duration are stronger than the short events with a 6–10-day duration, and the maximum amplitudes of the Central-Pacific (C) type and Eastern-Pacific (E) type of long events are larger than the Western-Pacific (W) type of long ones. The evolutions of these six types of WWEs are also quite different. The W-type short and long events and the C-type long events show a distinct eastward propagation, whereas the C-type short events and the E-type short and long events have no apparent propagation direction. We demonstrate that such a difference in the eastward propagation of WWEs can be significantly associated with the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO). The W-type events are more influenced heavily by the MJO, as indicated by their more distinct eastward propagation patterns, than the two other types of WWEs. In addition to the MJO, the convectively coupled Kelvin waves are also associated with the WWEs, especially for the short events.","Westerly wind events,Structure characteristics,Spatiotemporal diversity,Convectively coupled Kelvin waves,Madden-Julian oscillation,"

In addition, it could be required to correlate results with intelligence data and to integrate radar systems with the automatic identification system (AIS) and vessel traffic services (VTS). Other issues could be providing navigational risk detection to support operators, as well as improving resource allocation for greater efficiency and cost savings. Having access to other services, such as weather and environment information, could be precious for route planning. Additionally, timely and robust ways of sharing data and information between the authorities need to be developed with the objective of maximizing the sustainable use of oceans and seas, while enhancing the knowledge and innovation potential in maritime affairs.","Sea measurements,Sea surface,search radar,sensor fusion,marine radar,maritime situational awareness viewer,multitarget tracking data fusion system,Surveillance,Chirp modulation,target tracking,high-frequency surface-wave radar systems,multiple over-the-horizon HFSW radars,Wellen radar systems,Surface waves,sea surface currents,Marine vehicles,Radar measurements,maritime surveillance,"

"a geometry-based fuzzy approach for long-term association of vessels to maritime routes","2023","Either for recreational or professional reasons, ships travel across the globe generating a network of maritime traffic with routes connecting key areas such as ports, off-shore facilities or fishing areas. Monitoring vessels’ position relatively to maritime routes provides crucial information about their destination, and can help reducing the risk of collision. In this paper, we implement a fuzzy logic approach for associating vessels to maritime routes, suitable to variable surveillance contexts and very sparse data. Moreover, the framework is agnostic to the way maritime routes are provided, either reflecting patterns-of-life from statistical models extracted from real data or being hand-crafted by a user. Fuzzy membership functions enable expressing that vessels can belong more or less to route corridors, while they follow only one of the possible routes. The computation of membership scores relies on a precise distance computation involving geometrical properties of Earth, valid for very large route segments. The defuzzification step allows non-specific outputs. Several instantiations with aggregation operators of different semantics are compared on a real dataset of tracklets from the Automatic Identification System, with ground truth labels of routes. The performance is assessed in a quality space along with the three dimensions of correctness, specificity and confidence.","Performance metrics,Route segments,Maritime surveillance,Fuzzy logic classifier,"
"atmospheric reactive mercury concentrations in coastal australia and the southern ocean","2021","Mercury (Hg), especially reactive Hg (RM), data from the Southern Hemisphere (SH) are limited. In this study, long-term measurements of both gaseous elemental Hg (GEM) and RM were made at two ground-based monitoring locations in Australia, the Cape Grim Baseline Air Pollution Station (CGBAPS) in Tasmania, and the Macquarie University Automatic Weather Station (MQAWS) in Sydney, New South Wales. Measurements were also made on board the Australian RV Investigator (RVI) during an ocean research voyage to the East Antarctic coast. GEM was measured using the standard Tekran® 2537 series analytical platform, and RM was measured using cation exchange membranes (CEM) in a filter-based sampling method. Overall mean RM concentrations at CGBAPS and MQAWS were 15.9 ± 6.7 pg m−3 and 17.8 ± 6.6 pg m−3, respectively. For the 10-week austral summer period on RVI, mean RM was 23.5 ± 6.7 pg m−3. RM concentrations at CGBAPS were seasonally invariable, while those at MQAWS were significantly different between summer and winter due to seasonal changes in synoptic wind patterns. During the RVI voyage, RM concentrations were relatively enhanced along the Antarctic coast (up to 30 pg m−3) and GEM concentrations were variable (0.2 to 0.9 ng m−3), suggesting periods of enrichment and depletion. Both RM and GEM concentrations were relatively lower while transiting the Southern Ocean farther north of Antarctica. RM concentrations measured in this study were higher in comparison to most other reported measurements of RM in the global marine boundary layer (MBL), especially for remote SH locations. As observations of GEM and RM concentrations inform global ocean-atmosphere model simulations of the atmospheric Hg budget, our results have important implications for understanding of total atmospheric Hg (TAM).","Tekran 2537,Cation exchange membranes,Gaseous elemental mercury,Southern hemisphere,Cape Grim Baseline Air Pollution Station,Gaseous oxidized mercury,"
"the north atlantic ocean during the last deglaciation","1981","The last deglacial warming of the high-latitude North Atlantic Ocean (40–65°) occurred in three discrete steps: in the southeast and central regions at 13 000 B.P.; in the central and northern sectors at 10 000 B.P.; and in the western (Labrador Sea) sector between 9000 and 6000 B.P. This regionally time-transgressive sequence was punctuated by a major cooling and polar front readvance from 11 000 to 1000 B.P.; this briefly returned most of the high-latitude North Atlantic to almost full-glacial temperatures. Carbonate productivity levels reached minimum values from 16 000 B.P. to 13 000 B.P. and then gradually rose, reaching maximum values in the Holocene at about 6000 B.P. We interpret these changes in carbonate productivity as indicating a major influx of products of glacial wastage (meltwater and icebergs) from 16 000 to 13 000 B.P., with considerably reduced influx after 13 000 B.P. Combined with evidence for meltwater influx to the Gulf of Mexico via the Mississippi River, this suggests that the bulk of volumetric deglaciation in the Northern Hemisphere occurred considerably earlier than the main areal retreat of ice-sheet limits. This implies that the still-extensive ice sheets in the Northern Hemisphere were relatively thin by 13 000 B.P. Because there is no palynologic evidence of unusual atmospheric warming on the southern margins of the ice sheets before 13 000 B.P., we infer that this early phase of rapid ice disintegration occurred largely by iceberg calving and marine downdraw. We also infer that from 16 000 to 13 000 B.P. low winter insolation combined with a low-salinity meltwater layer to form sea ice south to 50°N; after that date, the winter sea-ice cover diminished significantly. We infer from this that the critical flux of winter moisture to the ice sheets was largely cut off from 16 000 to 13 000 B.P. and still significantly suppressed after 13 000 B.P. Moisture starvation thus hastened the disintegration of Northern Hemisphere ice masses. The brief but strong oceanic cooling roughly coincident with the European Younger Dryas (11 000 to 10 000 B.P.) appears to mark a major influx of tabular icebergs from a disintegrating Arctic ice shelf, perhaps enhanced by external forcing at higher frequencies (2500 yr).",""
"sensor combinations in heterogeneous multi-sensor fusion for maritime target tracking","2019","Safe navigation for autonomous surface vehicles requires a robust and reliable tracking system that maintains and estimates position and velocity of other vessels. This paper demonstrates a measurement level sensor fusion system for tracking in a maritime environment using lidar, radar, electrooptical and infrared cameras. The backbone of the system is a multi-sensor version of the Joint Integrated Probabilistic Data Association (JIPDA) with both existence and visibility probabilities. Using reference targets equipped with GPS receivers, the performance of different sensors and sensor combinations are evaluated for autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs), Several interesting observations are made, among them that passive sensors can help resolve merged measurements issues in radar tracking, and that the choice between radar and lidar may boil down to a trade-off between fast track initiation and large numbers of false tracks.","sensor fusion,marine radar,infrared cameras,Cameras,marine navigation,Global Positioning System,JIPDA,reference targets,target tracking,Robot sensing systems,Target tracking,Radar tracking,autonomous surface vehicles,visibility probabilities,lidar,optical radar,measurement level sensor fusion system,robust tracking system,radar tracking,ASV,infrared imaging,Sensor fusion,fast track initiation,maritime environment,safe navigation,reliable tracking system,probability,unmanned surface vehicle,heterogeneous multisensor fusion,GPS receivers,maritime target tracking,Joint Integrated Probabilistic Data Association,electrooptical cameras,sensor combinations,Detectors,passive sensors,"
"automatic detection of rescue targets in maritime search and rescue missions using uavs","2022","Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can be an important resource when performing Search and Rescue (SAR) operations at sea, as this technology is fairly inexpensive when compared to traditional SAR approaches that use significant human resources and expensive air and naval assets, thus enabling the deployment of several UAVs simultaneously in these missions to perform rescue targets search in maritime environments.In order to maximize the usefulness of these UAVs in such operations, we propose a method which utilizes a state-of-the-art object detection network to perform real-time rescue target detection on-board the UAV, using standard RGB cameras, with minimal human intervention, thus enabling an increased vehicle autonomy and search range. Additionally, since the UAVs only relay the candidate images and locations that contain possible rescue targets, given by the onboard detector, it is possible to have several UAVs working in parallel that report back to a single human operator.We have selected the YOLOv4-tiny detection network, pretrained in the COCO dataset, and retrained it to detect rescue targets at sea. For this purpose some datasets were recorded and annotated to simulate the presence of maritime rescue targets. The proposed approach has been validated on an independent test dataset, showing that it has good detection capabilities and thus providing convincing results regarding the use of UAVs with automatic target detection capabilities in SAR missions.","automatic target detection capabilities,rescue missions,remotely operated vehicles,real-time rescue target detection on-board,maritime rescue targets,Cameras,Search problems,significant human resources,Relays,rescue targets search,cameras,object detection,synthetic aperture radar,maritime search,YOLOv4-tiny detection network,Autonomous aerial vehicles,single human operator,increased vehicle autonomy,Real-time systems,autonomous aerial vehicles,state-of-the-art object detection network,mobile robots,search range,image sensors,Object detection,possible rescue targets,Detectors,UAV,automatic detection,"
"vhf maritime mobile communications: a systems approach to serving user requirements","1977","The existing international VHF maritime mobile communication system dates back to the 1947 International Radio Conference at Atlantic City, NJ. At that time, there was formal agreement on the place in the spectrum (built around the use of 156.80 MHz), and informal agreement on the use of a channel bandwidth of 100 kHz. This paper documents the events leading to the development of the maritime mobile VHF allocation structure in the United States in 1948 (Special Committee 7 of Radio Technical Commission for Marine Services). The establishment of a multichannel structure and basic rules for system operation are explained. The paper describes the subsequent adoption of the structure (FCC Rules and Regulations, 1952) by the maritime nations of Europe at the Hague, Holland, in 1957 and by the countries of the world at the International Radio Conference in Geneva, Switzerland, 1959. A description is given of the early and rapid growth of the US VHF structure on the Great Lakes, for safety and navigational purposes, and the expansion upon this usage in Europe to accomplish widespread port operations services. Major steps forward were taken in 1967 at the International Radio Conference on Maritime Mobile Services at Geneva, and in the promulgation of the FCC Rules of 1969. These actions established the 25-kHz channel bandwidth now in use. The availability, after 1968, of low-cost multichannel equipment, coupled with the increased channel availability of the new Rules set in motion a steady growth in usage by small vessels. More recent trends include the expanded usage of VHF to meet increased responsibilities of the US Coast Guard (USCG) for vessel management services and for surveillance of vessel operations. Reference is made to the current use of automation-for efficient systems management and for data exchanges between ship and shore-on the Great Lakes, and to the planning for introduction of automation on the inland rivers of the United States.","Mobile communication,Europe,Radio navigation,Cities and towns,Radio spectrum management,VHF radio communication,Safety,Surveillance,FCC,Bandwidth,Governmental regulations,Marine vehicles,Marine-vehicle communication,Lakes,"
"extraction of maritime road networks from large-scale ais data","2019","Extracting road network information including lane boundaries, lane centerlines, junctions and their relationship from AIS data plays an important role in location based services, urban computing and intelligent transportation systems, etc. However, AIS data are large scale, high noisy, the density and quality are very uneven in different areas, extracting a whole, continuous and smooth maritime road network with rich information from such data is a challenging problem. To address these issues, this paper proposes an adaptive maritime road network extraction approach that can extract both lane boundaries and centerlines for a large sea area from AIS data. Based on a road network definition including nodes, segments and segment curves, the approach designs parallel grid merging and filtering algorithms to determine if a grided area is inside lane or not. Lane boundaries are smoothed through jagged edge filtering and Simple Moving Average algorithms before centerline extraction. We evaluate our method based on real world AIS data in various area across the world's seas. Experimental results show the advantage of our method beyond the close related work.","continuous maritime road network,centerline extraction,trajectory computing,urban computing,segment curves,intelligent transportation systems,Noise measurement,moving average algorithms,road network,visual analysis,lane centerlines,spatio-temporal data mining,world AIS data,lane boundaries,marine engineering,Merging,adaptive maritime road network extraction approach,trajectory data mining,feature extraction,Artificial intelligence,roads,AIS data,Roads,Trajectory,road network information,large-scale AIS data,traffic engineering computing,location based services,Data mining,Junctions,smooth maritime road network,"
"unsupervised anomaly detection for underwater gliders using generative adversarial networks","2021","An effective anomaly detection system is critical for marine autonomous systems operating in complex and dynamic marine environments to reduce operational costs and achieve concurrent large-scale fleet deployments. However, developing an automated fault detection system remains challenging for several reasons including limited data transmission via satellite services. Currently, most anomaly detection for marine autonomous systems, such as underwater gliders, rely on intensive analysis by pilots. This study proposes an unsupervised anomaly detection system using bidirectional generative adversarial networks guided by assistive hints for marine autonomous systems with time series data collected by multiple sensors. In this study, the anomaly detection system for a fleet of underwater gliders is trained on two healthy deployment datasets and tested on other nine deployment datasets collected by a selection of vehicles operating in a range of locations and environmental conditions. The system is successfully applied to detect anomalies in the nine test deployments, which include several different types of anomalies as well as healthy behaviour. Also, a sensitivity study of the data decimation settings suggests the proposed system is robust for Near Real-Time anomaly detection for underwater gliders.","Anomaly detection,Generative adversarial networks,Marine autonomous systems,Underwater gliders,"
"terrigenous sediment supply in the scotia sea (southern ocean): response to late quaternary ice dynamics in patagonia and on the antarctic peninsula","2000","Geochemical and mineralogical compositions of modern and Late Quaternary marine sediments from the Scotia Sea trace sources and transport paths of terrigenous sediment. We discuss downcore variations of compositional data of two sediment cores from the northern and southern Scotia Sea that correlate with fluctuations in magnetic susceptibility. Sediments were derived from very different sources at both localities, as revealed by contrasting clay-mineral assemblages. However, a common feature is the input of more basic and undifferentiated crustal material with the potential of high magnetic susceptibility during glacial periods, indicated by variable quartz/feldspar ratios and major, trace and rare earth elements. Terrigenous sediments mainly originate from nearby terrestrial sources or are introduced through interbasinal sediment transfer from adjacent seas. The observed temporal compositional variations have to be attributed to changes in the relative detrital contributions from the diverse source areas. Ice-mass extensions in southern Patagonia, on the Antarctic Peninsula and adjacent islands likely control the supply of glaciogenic detritus to the open ocean during times of glacial expansion, diluting the sediment input of interbasinal origin. Current transport is mainly responsible for sediment dispersal to the pelagic Scotia Sea and may amplify the glaciological source signals during glacial climate periods, because of a stronger wind forcing of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current.","mineralogy,continental glaciation,Southern Ocean,geochemistry,sediment provenance,terrigenous materials,"
"progress in space-borne studies of permafrost for climate science: towards a multi-ecv approach","2017","Remotely-sensed climate data records (CDRs) provide a basis for spatially distributed global climate model (GCM) inputs and validation methods. GCMs can take advantage of land surface models (LSMs), which aim to resolve surface energy, water and carbon budgets and hence these LSMs present important boundary conditions at the land-atmosphere interface. Pertinently, satellite data assimilation approaches are essential for improved land surface modelling for northern high latitudes ecosystems where permafrost degradation is reported to be ongoing. Permafrost, however, is an Essential Climate Variable (ECV) that cannot directly be monitored from space. Here, we advocate that CDRs, such as those compiled under the European Space Agency (ESA) Climate Change Initiative (CCI) programme, may be used in combination with permafrost models to improve our understanding of permafrost extent and degradation in a changing climate system. We describe the current types of remotely-sensed surface feature products that are widely used as indicators for permafrost related features. Furthermore, we highlight issues of using these site-specific permafrost proxies related to spatial scale, as well as the uncertainties in establishing present-day permafrost extent itself. Our assessment of the key ECVs that impact on permafrost, demonstrates how models that incorporate EO CDRs have the potential to boost our knowledge of permafrost conditions through better parametrisation of the thermal regime of permafrost soils.","EO CDR,Permafrost,ESA CCI,"
"distributed resource allocation for general energy efficiency maximization in offshore maritime device-to-device communication","2021","In maritime scenario, the communication service, if any, is likely to be expensive due to the high-cost satellite transmissions or the very limited offshore coverage of terrestrial networks. Thus, how to achieve efficient radio resource management is one of the critical issues in maritime communication. In this letter, by exploiting the device-to-device (D2D) mechanism, we identify a general energy efficiency (GEE) optimization problem, which takes into account the physical link performance and the usersâ€™ pairing willingness (PW) quantified by a modified Jaccard coefficient metric. Then, we divide the GEE optimization problem into two sub-problems of user pairing and power allocation, and solve them by a distributed pairing method and by a new distributed resource allocation scheme, respectively.

"real-time multi-object tracking using adaptive filtering and filter banks for maritime applications","2021","This paper presents a novel approach to Multi-Object-Tracking (MOT), which solves the well-known problem of maritime surveillance. We use exteroceptive sensors, such as LiDAR, and Automatic Identification System (AIS), to measure the surroundingsâ€™ Vessels. These objects are associated using evidence theory. Afterward, the proposed algorithm tracks all the objects using a new concept: each object is tracked with a respective filter bank consisting of three Adaptive Extended Kalman Filters (AEKF) as subfilters. These have the same prediction model but different correction algorithms based on various measurement sources. The covariance noise matrices are adapted based on the current measurement quality. The filter banks can overcome drawbacks such as wrong and incomplete measurements, thus improving tracking performance.We have validated the algorithm in real-world scenarios in Rostock Harbor, Germany. The proposed algorithm can track all the objects within the view simultaneously in real-time. By comparing with a reference vessel, the mean 2D position error is ca. 2 m, which is much smaller than the AIS-only solution (5 to 10 m).

"fault-associated seabed mounds (carbonate knolls?) off western ireland and north-west australia","1994","Groups of seabed mounds, suspected to be modern carbonate knolls or bioherms, have been located on reflection seismic data in the Porcupine Basin off western Ireland and in the Vulcan Sub-basin off north-west Australia. The size of these mounds is impressive, often being over 1 km across and over 100 m high. In the Porcupine Basin they occur in water depths of 650–1000 m, whereas in the Vulcan Sub-basin they occur in water depths of 200–350 m. Shallow seabed coring in the Porcupine Basin has provided data on the age, lithological composition and hydrocarbon concentrations in the upper 3 m layer of sediment both on and off the mounds. In both basins the mounds occur close to faults which may provide conduits for upward migrating hydrocarbons. The seepage of hydrocarbons is suspected to have caused local eutrophication or ‘fertilization’ by providing nutrients to bacteria, which in turn are part of the food chain for higher organisms. The dominant organism in the Porcupine Basin examples appears to be the deep-water coral Lophelia sp., whereas in the Vulcan Sub-basin the mounds appear to be Halimeda-dominated.","carbonate knolls,hydrocarbon seepage,seabed mounds,"
"understanding roman gold coinage inside out","2021","The true purity of Roman silver coinage was hidden by enriching the surfaces of the coins. The question investigated here is whether Roman gold coins were also surfaced enriched. Two non-destructive techniques were employed to do this: X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and a ‘newer’ technique, muonic X-ray emission spectroscopy (μXES). For the latter, the momentum of the muons is controlled, allowing for the composition of the coin to be determined at various depths. Here we show that there is no surface enrichment of the Roman gold coins analysed. Furthermore, we show that XRF and μXES return congruent results at the near surface. This all supports the integrity of surface level analyses of Roman gold coins. We then discuss the broader applicability of our muon technique to the further study of Roman gold coinage, to the cultural heritage sector and to archaeological scientists more generally.","XRF,Non-destructive,μXES,Gold,Roman,Muons,Purity,"

"planktonic foraminiferal abnormalities in coastal and open marine eastern mediterranean environments: a natural stress monitoring approach in recent and early holocene marine systems","2018","Marine environmental status can be assessed through the study of bio-indicator species. Here, we monitor natural environmental stress by the occurrence of morphologically abnormal planktonic foraminiferal specimens from a suite of surface sediments in the eastern Mediterranean Sea. We also compare Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) abnormality observations from sapropel S1-derived sediments in the Aegean, Libyan and Levantine basins, since they provide a direct record of a natural stress experiment that took place over past time scales. At initial sapropel deposition levels, we observe increased growth asymmetry in Globigerinoides ruber twinned and twisted individuals, possibly associated with eutrophication and anoxia. In modern material, a range of malformations and aberrant morphologies from slight deformity with smaller or overdeveloped chambers to more severe deformity with abnormally protruding or misplaced chambers, distorted spirals, and double tests is also observed, as a result of the hypersaline, oligotrophic and oxygen-depleted nature of the Mediterranean Sea water column. Overall, we highlight the current use of the relative abundance of abnormal tests as a bio-indicator for monitoring natural stress, especially the occurrence of twin specimens as indicative of high-salinity stress conditions, and further illustrate the necessity to map both their spatial and temporal distribution for accurate paleoenvironmental reconstructions.

"integrated maritime security & surveillance","2017","The coast guard are not being able to detect foreign intruders in some cases. Occasionally, the fishermen would often sight a stranger poaching in their fishing grounds, but the maritime transport would often leave without making any penalty. These problems also exist within Indian coasts too having a large fleet at its disposal. The system that we propose would prevent the fishermen from crossing the maritime border line and would help the fishermen to inform the coast guard regarding a trespasser. Thus, the overall security of coastline will increase and it also would reduce the periodic patrolling of sea by the coast guard.","surveillance,maritime,Global Positioning System,foreign intruders,maritime security,Sea measurements,Indian coasts,marine safety,Relays,maritime transport,coast guard,fishermen,fishing grounds,PIR sensor,Laser beams,Laser,Coast-guard,Security,maritime border line,Integrated circuit modeling,"
"shipboard trials of an ozone-based ballast water treatment system","2010","Legislation introduced by the United Nations International Maritime Organization (IMO) has focused primarily on standards defining successful treatments designed to remove invasive species entrained in ballast water. An earlier shipboard study found that ozone introduced into salt water ballast resulted in the formation of bromine compounds, measured as total residual oxidants (TRO) that were toxic to both bacteria and plankton. However, the diffuser system employed to deliver ozone to the ballast water tanks resulted in patchiness in TRO distribution and toxicity to entrained organisms. In this follow-up study, the shipboard diffuser system was replaced by a single Venturi-type injection system designed to deliver a more homogeneous biocide distribution. Within-tank variability in TRO levels and associated toxicity to zooplankton, phytoplankton and marine bacteria was measured via a matrix of tubes deployed to sample different locations in treated and untreated (control) tanks. Three trials were conducted aboard the oil tanker S/T Prince William Sound in the Strait of Juan de Fuca off Port Angeles, Washington State, USA, between June and December 2007. Mortalities of plankton and bacteria and oxidant concentrations were recorded for treated and untreated ballast water up to 3days following treatment, and residual toxicity beyond this period was measured by bioassay of standard test organisms. Results indicated uniform compliance with current IMO standards, but only partial compliance with other existing and pending ballast water legislation.","Ballast water,Invasive species,Ozonation,"
"measuring atmospheric composition change","2009","Scientific findings from the last decades have clearly highlighted the need for a more comprehensive approach to atmospheric change processes. In fact, observation of atmospheric composition variables has been an important activity of atmospheric research that has developed instrumental tools (advanced analytical techniques) and platforms (instrumented passenger aircrafts, ground-based in situ and remote sensing stations, earth observation satellite instruments) providing essential information on the composition of the atmosphere. The variability of the atmospheric system and the extreme complexity of the atmospheric cycles for short-lived gaseous and aerosol species have led to the development of complex models to interpret observations, test our theoretical understanding of atmospheric chemistry and predict future atmospheric composition. The validation of numerical models requires accurate information concerning the variability of atmospheric composition for targeted species via comparison with observations and measurements. In this paper, we provide an overview of recent advances in instrumentation and methodologies for measuring atmospheric composition changes from space, aircraft and the surface as well as recent improvements in laboratory techniques that permitted scientific advance in the field of atmospheric chemistry. Emphasis is given to the most promising and innovative technologies that will become operational in the near future to improve knowledge of atmospheric composition. Our current observation capacity, however, is not satisfactory to understand and predict future atmospheric composition changes, in relation to predicted climate warming. Based on the limitation of the current European observing system, we address the major gaps in a second part of the paper to explain why further developments in current observation strategies are still needed to strengthen and optimise an observing system not only capable of responding to the requirements of atmospheric services but also to newly open scientific questions.","Observation,Climate,Instrumentation,Air quality,Atmosphere,"

"risk management with hard-soft data fusion in maritime domain awareness","2014","Enhanced situational awareness is integral to risk management and response evaluation. Dynamic systems that incorporate both hard and soft data sources allow for comprehensive situational frameworks which can supplement physical models with conceptual notions of risk. The processing of widely available semi-structured textual data sources can produce soft information that is readily consumable by such a framework. In this paper, we augment the situational awareness capabilities of a recently proposed risk management framework (RMF) with the incorporation of soft data. We illustrate the beneficial role of the hard-soft data fusion in the characterization and evaluation of potential vessels in distress within Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) scenarios. Risk features pertaining to maritime vessels are defined a priori and then quantified in real time using both hard (e.g., Automatic Identification System, Douglas Sea Scale) as well as soft (e.g., historical records of worldwide maritime incidents) data sources. A risk-aware metric to quantify the effectiveness of the hard-soft fusion process is also proposed. Though illustrated with MDA scenarios, the proposed hard-soft fusion methodology within the RMF can be readily applied to other domains.","Feeds,RMF,sensor fusion,Risk management,Hidden Markov models,dynamic systems,Marine vehicles,maritime domain awareness,maritime vessels,Feature extraction,hard data sources,situational frameworks,semistructured textual data sources processing,automatic identification system,marine safety,MDA scenarios,marine engineering,risk-aware metric,risk management,response evaluation,situational awareness,Measurement,risk features,Douglas sea scale,worldwide maritime incidents,risk management framework,soft data sources,marine vehicles,Data mining,hard-soft data fusion,"

"detecting anomalies from a multitarget tracking output","2014","Surveillance systems typically incorporate multitarget tracking algorithms for sequential estimation of kinematic states (e.g. positions, velocities) of moving objects in the surveillance domain of interest. This letter proposes an algorithm for online detection of anomalies in the motion and the count of objects, using the output of a multiobject tracking algorithm. The surveillance area is partitioned by a square grid and the kinematic states that fall inside each cell of the grid are modelled by a Poisson point process. During the unsupervised learning phase, the parameters of the Poisson point process are estimated for each cell. The testing phase is performed sequentially by threshold detection at a specified level of significance. The performance of the algorithm is illustrated using the Automatic Identification System (AIS) dataset in the context of maritime surveillance.","Kinematics,Kernel,multiobject tracking algorithm,Vectors,Poisson point process,sequential estimation,target tracking,unsupervised learning phase,multitarget tracking algorithms,Testing,object tracking,automatic identification system dataset,maritime surveillance,Partitioning algorithms,Tracking,online anomaly detection,Surveillance,kinematic states,video surveillance,"
"impact of the open biomass fires in spring and summer of 2006 on the chemical composition of background air in south-eastern finland","2008","In the spring and summer of 2006 the air quality in southern Finland was affected by two major biomass fire smoke episodes. At the Virolahti background station, closest to the eastern fire areas, the episodes lasted altogether several weeks. The high point in spring was 25 April and in summer 13 August. In spring the aerosol detected at Virolahti originated at distances of even hundreds of kilometres to the south and south-east, and consequently was a mixture of material from biomass burning and from other sources (both LRT and local), all of which contributed to the detected elevation of PM10 concentrations. The elevated concentrations of trace elements (Cd, Pb, Zn) during the most intense biomass fire episode were associated with other anthropogenic emissions. In contrast, during August 2006, the PM10 at Virolahti was quite exclusively impacted by close (ca. 50–100km) biomass fire sources. The presumably organic component comprised, at its highest, as much as 90% of the total PM10. In addition to record high PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations, the concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were considerably elevated, even reaching values more typical of wintertime urban environments. During the peaks of the episodes in August, the total gaseous mercury concentration in the air was more than double its background value. In general, the trace elements did not exceed their background values.","PM,Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons,Total gaseous mercury,Open biomass fires,Trace elements,"

"maritime surveillance using spaceborne gnss-reflectometry: the role of the scattering configuration and receiving polarization channel","2018","Recent studies have analyzed the chance of exploiting Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS)-Reflectometry observables for maritime surveillance and sea target detection. In this paper, we provide a feasibility study of the ship detection problem using spaceborne GNSS-R data. The analysis is performed via the evaluation of the signal-to-noise-plus-clutter-ratio and signal-to-noise-ratio relevant to an isolated ship target in open sea. In particular, we investigated the impact of the GNSS-R acquisition geometry and radar signal polarization. The influence of sea state and ship orientation is assessed as well. The analysis is based on a sound theoretical electromagnetic model of the bistatic radar cross section of the ship target. The analysis clearly shows the benefits of 1) the backscattering configuration with respect to the conventional forward-scattering one and 2) the RHCP receiving channel w.r.t. the conventional LHCP one, used in sea surface analysis. However, the ship orientation and the sea state still play a key role in ship detectability.","marine radar,ship orientation,ship detection problem,ship detection,radar detection,radar clutter,spaceborne GNSS-Reflectometry,Marine vehicles,reflectometry,marine navigation,bistatic radar cross section,electromagnetic model,radar signal polarization,signal-to-noise-plus-clutter-ratio,ships,ship detectability,satellite navigation,bistatic radar,maritime surveillance,radar cross-sections,object detection,Sea surface,forward-scattering,Backscatter,backscattering geometry,backscattering configuration,sea target detection,Global Navigation Satellite Systems-Reflectometry,isolated ship target,sea surface analysis,Ocean temperature,spaceborne radar,Signal to noise ratio,RHCP receiving channel w.r.t,Spaceborne radar,spaceborne GNSS-R data,electromagnetic wave scattering,backscatter,GNSS-Reflectometry,Global navigation satellite system,electromagnetic wave polarisation,"
"monitoring of high biomass phaeocystis globosa blooms in the southern north sea by in situ and future spaceborne hyperspectral radiometry","2022","Phaeocystis globosa (P. globosa hereafter) is a phytoplankton species which commonly blooms at high biomass in April–May in the Southern North Sea and forms undesirable foam which accumulates on the beaches. Monitoring of this species is required by EU directives. Measurement of phytoplankton species composition has historically been made by pigment or microscopic analysis of water samples, which is spatially sparse and temporally infrequent e.g. weekly/monthly. In-water instruments such as flow cytometers can provide very high frequency data but at high acquisition and maintenance cost. Automated in situ above water radiometry has the potential to provide very high frequency data at single locations but requires very careful design of processing algorithms in turbid waters with high non-algal absorption. Spaceborne radiometry could provide both very good spatial coverage and moderate/high frequency of data, e.g. daily/weekly, but accurate determination of phytoplankton species composition is considerably more difficult in turbid waters than in open ocean waters. Prior studies based on a limited number of shipborne reflectance measurements suggested feasibility of P. globosa detection in turbid waters from hyperspectral radiometry. The availability of a new autonomous above water hyperspectral radiometer system has enabled further refinement and intensive testing of these techniques. From a time-series of 4356 water reflectance spectra measured near Ostend harbour in Belgian coastal waters from 2020/04/01 to 2020/08/18, two existing algorithms for P. globosa detection were successfully applied. Results show a high biomass P. globosa bloom occurring in late-April/early-May as found every year in water sample analyses for Belgian coastal waters. The high temporal resolution of the radiometric data allows to capture the evolution of the bloom at time scales sufficiently short (hourly and daily) compared to growth/decay and tidal processes. The challenges of extending the methods to future spaceborne instruments are also tested by simulating the impact of errors in sensor inter-band calibration, atmospheric correction and radiometric noise. Results show that because of their spectral coherence, atmospheric correction errors impact only slightly P. globosa detection whereas inaccuracy in inter-band calibration and radiometric noise are much more problematic as they affect each spectral band independently. Because radiometric noise should be reduced in the new generation of hyperspectral sensors and can always be reduced by spatial binning, the inter-band relative calibration uncertainty appears to be the main challenge for spaceborne mission design. Indeed, it was demonstrated that inter-band calibration error should be <0.25% and ideally 0.1% at top of the atmosphere highlighting the need for particular attention to inter-band calibration in sensor design and post processing treatments including vicarious calibration.","Belgian coastal zone,Inter-band calibration,PANTHYR,Signal to noise ratio,Autonomous measurements,Hyperspectral radiometry,Hyperspectral satellite sensors,"
"automatic identification of maritime incidents from unstructured articles","2018","In this paper, we present two Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for identifying maritime incidents described in unstructured articles from multiple sources. The first technique is a document classification scheme that determines if an article describes a maritime incident. Two variations of each article are created: the first only contains the article's title, the other contains the title and content. These are converted to both binary and frequency bags-of-words. Furthermore, two feature selection methods are tested: Weka's CfsSubsetEval and retaining the 300 most frequent words. Each dataset is tested with 41 classifiers from the Weka suite, with the most accurate classifiers including Logistic Regression (98.5%), AdaBoostM1(BayesNet) (98.33%), and RandomForest (97.56%). The second technique performs information extraction on an article to determine the location of the maritime incident. In addition to using regular expressions and Named Entity Recognition (NER), the approach focuses its attention on sentences that contain piracy keywords as well as sentences which occur earlier in the article. In our testing, this approach achieved 87.9% accuracy.

"cultural dynamics and ceramic resource use at late bronze age/early iron age troy, northwestern turkey","2013","Changes in resource use over time can provide insight into technological choice and the extent of long-term stability in cultural practices. In this paper we re-evaluate the evidence for a marked demographic shift at the inception of the Early Iron Age at Troy by applying a robust macroscale analysis of changing ceramic resource use over the Late Bronze and Iron Age. We use a combination of new and legacy analytical datasets (NAA and XRF), from excavated ceramics, to evaluate the potential compositional range of local resources (based on comparisons with sediments from within a 10 km site radius). Results show a clear distinction between sediment-defined local and non-local ceramic compositional groups. Two discrete local ceramic resources have been previously identified and we confirm a third local resource for a major class of EIA handmade wares and cooking pots. This third source appears to derive from a residual resource on the Troy peninsula (rather than adjacent alluvial valleys). The presence of a group of large and heavy pithoi among the non-local groups raises questions about their regional or maritime origin.","Local production,Bottom-up sampling,Macro-analysis,Multivariate analysis,Neutron Activation Analysis,Statistical power relationships,Legacy datasets,"

"long-term trends of upwelling and impacts on primary productivity in the alaskan beaufort sea","2013","Using a previously established wind proxy for upwelling along the North Slope of Alaska, we examine the interannual to decadal variability in upwelling as well as the climatological monthly trends. The ability of the upwelling to trigger phytoplankton blooms via upward nitrate flux from the halocline is then investigated using data from a moored array together with the proxy. The 70-year record of wind speed from the Barrow, Alaska meteorological station (1941–2010) reveals that strong upwelling events – lasting at least 4 days and exceeding 10m/s during the storm – occur throughout the year. On average there are 9–10 upwelling events per year, and the number and strength of events has increased over the last 25 years. The low-frequency variability in the upwelling co-varies with previously documented Arctic climate trends, but there is no significant correlation with various high latitude atmospheric indices. There are two seasonal peaks in the occurrence of upwelling, in May and November. The role of the Beaufort High and Aleutian Low in driving the upwelling is investigated using NCEP reanalysis fields. Fluctuations in both of these centers of action contribute to the enhanced winds, and the location of the Aleutian Low storm track plays a key role in the seasonal variability of the upwelling. The upward nitrate flux due to storms in the open water period can account for new primary production that is on par with carbon fixed during the summer growing season in the absence of storms. Evidence from satellite ocean color data of such wind-induced phytoplankton blooms is presented.","Primary production,Long-term wind trends,Upwelling trends,Nitrate flux,"

"maritime target localization from bistatic range measurements in space-based passive radar","2021","In this article, localization of a maritime target using a passive multistatic radar system, consisting of a single receiver and a number of satellites as its transmitters, is investigated.

In the receiver, the reflected signals from the target along with the direct signal from the satellites are employed to extract a set of bistatic range measurements. Leveraging these measurements and the satellite's position information, a novel localization method considering zero height of maritime target and appropriate combination of the measurement signals is presented.

"maritime traffic route detection framework based on statistical density analysis from ais data using a clustering algorithm","2022","Maritime traffic routes by ships navigation vary according to country and geographic characteristics, and they differ according to the characteristics of the ships. In ocean areas adjacent to coasts, regulated routes are present, e.g., traffic separation scheme for ships entering and leaving; however, most ocean areas do not have such routes. Maritime traffic route research has been conducted based on computer engineering to create routes; however, ship characteristics were not considered. Thus, this article proposes a framework to generate maritime traffic routes using statistical density analysis. Here, automatic identification system (AIS) data are used to derive quantitative traffic routes. Preprocessing is applied to the AIS data, and a similar ship trajectory pattern is decomposed into a matrix based on the Hausdorffâ€“distance algorithm and then stored in a database. A similar pattern makes the AIS trajectory simple using the Douglasâ€“Peucker algorithm. In addition, density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) is performed to identify the waypoints of vessels then create routes by connecting waypoints. The width of maritime routes created based on a similar ship trajectory is subjected to kernel density estimation analysis (KDE). Then, waypoints evaluation of the main route is performed from the results of KDE 75% and 90% considering the statistical in the total maritime traffic, and the results applied to the targeted ocean area are compared. Finally, the result of KDE 90% of maritime traffic with framework analyzed the safety route, which can be a basis for developing routes for maritime autonomous surface ships.","traffic separation scheme,ocean areas,marine accidents,Clustering algorithms,Safety,targeted ocean area,Douglas-Peucker algorithm,automatic identification system data,vehicle routing,total maritime traffic,Marine vehicles,maritime autonomous surface ships,quantitative traffic routes,geographic characteristics,DBSCAN,statistical analysis,ships,marine safety,kernel density estimation,AIS trajectory simple,maritime traffic route detection framework,kernel density estimation analysis,Oceans,Hausdorff-distance algorithm,ship trajectory pattern,framework,pattern clustering,Artificial intelligence,statistical density analysis,marine engineering computing,Trajectory,ship characteristics,maritime traffic route research,Navigation,safety route,density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise,clustering algorithm,AIS data,maritime traffic route,"

"rainwater chemical composition at two sites in central mexico","2006","Chemical analyses were performed on rainwater samples collected at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) in Mexico City and at a wooded site, Rancho Viejo (RV) in the State of Mexico, for the periods 1994–2000 and 1994–1999, respectively. At UNAM, rainwater was collected for the entire rainy season period each year, while at RV, technical considerations limited collection to weekends only. The results showed large variations in rainwater chemical composition in most years, mainly because of the variability of meteorological conditions and also because of changes in source emissions. Sulfates and NH4+ showed higher annual volume-weighted mean concentrations (VWMC) in both sites. At UNAM, the maximum annual VWMC for SO42− occurred in March and the minimum in July and August. Lower concentrations of almost all ions were found at RV; however, the H+ concentration was higher at this site. The pH in Mexico City, calculated from the annual VWMC of H+, was 4.95, which is a little higher than pH values reported in some other countries. Despite the fact that sulfate and NO3− concentrations were lower at RV, the pH was lower. Air-mass back trajectories were calculated for individual concentrations of SO42−, H+, NH4+, Ca2+, and Mg2+, observed at each sampling site for weekend data. At RV, sulfate concentrations were higher when air-mass back trajectories indicated a wind flow from Mexico City and Toluca at 1000 MAGL (meters above ground level) and 3000 MAGL. The hydrogen ion exhibited the same behavior. Calcium and Mg2+ concentrations were also higher when the wind blew from urban areas at 1000 and 3000 MAGL. At UNAM, H+ concentration was lower and Ca2+ and Mg2+ were higher when wind blew from the northern sector of the city at 1000 and 3000 MAGL. In UNAM, the NO3−/SO42− and NH4+/SO42− ratios were 0.5 and 1.09 in 1994 and 0.86 and 1.64 in 2000, respectively, indicating a decrease in SO2 emissions resulting from the change of fuel oil to gas fuel. The SO42−/Ca2+ ratio was significantly lower at the UNAM site (1.82) compared to RV (5.36), and the SO42−/H+ ratio was significantly higher at the UNAM site (6.77) compared to RV (2.01). The Spearman's rho correlation between ionic concentrations indicated a positive correlation in most cases (p<0.05) for data from UNAM and RV. The multiple regression correlation analysis to predict H+ concentration in Mexico City showed that NO3−, NH4+, SO42−, and Ca2+ contributed 23.2%, 20.9%, 8.0%, and 6.1%, respectively, to the H+ prediction, while Cl− plus Na+ plus K+ only contributed 2.2%, and Mg2+ did not contribute. Sea-salt contribution to rainwater chemical composition was negligible with any wind direction at both levels. Excess sulfate (non-sea-salt sulfate) represented 98.7% of the total sulfate in rainwater collected during weekends at RV and 98.6% for weekend and annual rain samples at UNAM.","Central Mexico,Acidity in forests,Annual variations,Rainwater chemistry,"
"detection and geovisualization of abnormal vessel behavior from video","2021","Intelligent maritime situational awareness pursues an effective understanding of the majority of the activities related to the maritime domain (impacting the safety, security, economy, or environment), with the aid of artificial intelligence systems. Such an understanding requires the development of automated processes capable of not only detecting abnormal behavior but also of visually-representing and interpreting it. Although much progress has been made in anomaly detection and visualization using vessel self-reporting positioning data, there have been no corresponding advances using video data, despite the increasing use of cameras for maritime surveillance. In this work, we introduce a framework which goes beyond vessel tracking for anomaly detection in video, and is therefore applicable to scenes with a high density of vessels. The proposed framework detects abnormal behavior using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and interprets this knowledge using metrics derived from clustering the positions and courses provided by an independent vessel/motion detector. These detections are geovisualized using an advanced displaying tool where detected abnormal behavior may be localized on the globe, providing an infrastructure for intelligent maritime situational awareness.","generative adversarial network,surveillance,Safety,anomaly detection,Generative adversarial networks,data visualisation,Knowledge engineering,security of data,geovisualization,intelligent maritime situational awareness,marine engineering,abnormal vessel behavior,maritime surveillance,vessel self-reporting positioning data,object detection,maritime domain,Measurement,Real-time systems,video signal processing,artificial intelligence systems,Tools,artificial intelligence,Detectors,"
"multiple episodes of fluid flow in the sw barents sea (loppa high) evidenced by gas flares, pockmarks and gas hydrate accumulation","2012","Gas and gas hydrates have gained considerable attention in the last 20yr due to their possible impact on global climate change from methane escalations. Our study area, the SW Barents Sea, is unique in its evolution due to the effect of glaciations which removed thick layers of sediment from the seabed. Unloading due to erosion and deglaciation resulted in opening of pre-existing faults and creation of new ones, facilitating fluid migration and eventually escape into the water from the subsurface. Expressions of hydrocarbon gas accumulation and fluid flow such as gas hydrates and pockmarks are widely distributed in the Barents Sea. Several gas flares, some of them 200m high in echograms, occur along a segment of the Ringvassøy Loppa Fault Complex, indicating open fractures and active fluid flow. Observation of gas flares along regional fault complexes outside pockmark regions indicates that present gas escape occurs along faults only. The pockmark formation and gas flares belong to different episodes of fluid flow. The pockmarks are absent outside soft sediment depocentres indicating that their existence is related to the presence of recording medium. The thin sediment cover in pockmarks and their penetration down into glaciomarine sediments indicate that they formed after deposition of these sediments and that fluid escape was active to the very recent past. Methane hydrate stability zone (MHSZ) modelling shows that after the last glacial maximum 18000–2000014Cyears ago, the MHSZ has thinned from 600m to zero in most parts of the SW Barents Sea. The fluid expulsion probably happened after retreat of the glaciers causing release of methane from dissociation of methane hydrates through fluid escape processes which lasted until recently. Bottom simulating reflectors (BSR) observed are probably due to structure II hydrates formed from gas containing higher order hydrocarbon components such as ethane, propane, etc. along with methane. The study area falls close to the new gigantic oil discoveries, Skrugard and Havis, and north of the Snøhvit hydrocarbon field.","pockmarks,gas hydrate,BSR,gas flares,Barents Sea,seismic,"
"pollution levels and deposition processes of airborne organic pollutants over the central adriatic area: temporal variabilities and source identification","2021","First data on polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and nitro-aromatic compounds (NACs) in aerosols as well as of PAHs, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and NACs in bulk and wet atmospheric deposition samples were simultaneously obtained during 6-month-long field campaign at the costal central Adriatic area. Special attention was given to open-fire biomass burning episodes as extreme events common for the overall Mediterranean coastal area in order to gain a better understanding of the atmospheric variabilities and potential sources of trace organic pollutants in coastal environments. Diesel and gasoline combustion related to land and maritime traffic as well as occasional open-fire episodes (forest fires) were found to be the dominant pollution sources of PAHs in PM10 particles. NACs were determined almost exclusively in samples affected by biomass burning episodes. Open-fire episodes had a strong contribution to the overall NACs atmospheric deposition fluxes. Several chlorinated congeners of PCBs were predominantly contributed in deposition samples.","PAHs,NACs,Atmospheric deposition,PCBs,Coastal area,Biomass burning,"
"gipsyx/rtgx, a new tool set for space geodetic operations and research","2020","GipsyX/RTGx is the Jet Propulsion Laboratory’s (JPL) next generation software package for positioning, navigation, timing, and Earth science using measurements from three geodetic techniques: Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR), and Doppler Orbitography and Radiopositioning Integrated by Satellite (DORIS); with Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) under development.

"developing a framework for attribution analysis of urban pluvial flooding to human-induced climate impacts","2021","This study proposes a framework for the attribution analysis of urban flooding to historical anthropogenic climate impacts using real (historical) and counterfactual (natural) simulations from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) and Phase 6 (CMIP6) general circulation models (GCMs). A cluster analysis is implemented to select independent GCMs and to decrease the high computational time of the urban flood modeling. A two-step spatiotemporal statistical downscaling based on the generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution parameters is performed to meet the requirement of a fine-scale precipitation resolution for the urban flood simulations. Using the downscaled distribution parameters, the intensity–duration-frequency (IDF) curves and composite design storms for four return periods of 2, 10, 20 and 50 years are created to be used as the inputs of an InfoWorks ICM hydrodynamic model for a case study in Antwerp city, Belgium. The fraction of attributable risk (FAR) framework and the causal counterfactual probability theory are used to quantify anthropogenic climate influences on urban pluvial flooding. The results show that the GEV parameters of location and scale nicely follow the power relation, providing an opportunity for the temporal downscaling of precipitation extremes. A disagreement is found between the GCMs on the contribution of anthropogenic climate factors on pluvial flooding, some illustrating a higher probability of flooding due to anthropogenic climate impacts, and some a lower one. It can therefore be concluded that the urban flooding in Antwerp is not attributable to anthropogenic climate impacts.","Scaling relations,Fraction of attributable risk,CMIP6 GCMs,Urban flood,Generalized extreme value (GEV) parameters,Extreme precipitation,"
"a fast sar image position algorithm for maritime target location","2016","In order to find the maritime targets location in SAR image accurately, a fast R-D algorithm is introduced in this paper and it can solve targets location problems which are in the sea area. The real latitude and longitude coordinates measure system and geographical coordinates are built up for SAR image, then the targets located in the sea can be point out. First, based on information in SAR satellite data headers the Doppler center frequency coefficients can be calculated. Then the parameters are carried in the R-D pattern for calculate four vertex coordinates of SAR image. Generally the solution of R-D pattern is an iterative process, here a fast algorithm is proposed which combined with slope distance, Doppler parameters and earth model to reduce variables, then and the position of SAR is calculated and the latitude and longitude coordinates of target is also obtained. Second, the SAR image geocoding can be made up and the target in SAR image over sea can be found out. Finally, compare these results with AIS data, the accuracy of location is analyzed. The result shows that the deviation of distance location is less than 200 meters, and the deviation of azimuth is less than 6'. The error is reasonable for real application. This algorithm is stability, fast and satisfies with target location in the sea.","R-D pattern solution,Satellites,hydrological techniques,latitude coordinates measure system,Mathematical model,Slant range Doppler parameters,Doppler center frequency coefficients,earth model,image coding,geographical coordinates,Synthetic aperture radar,geophysical image processing,SAR satellite data headers,vertex coordinates,variable reduction,Doppler parameters,synthetic aperture radar,Maritime targets,radar imaging,Doppler effect,geographic information systems,longitude coordinates measure system,slope distance,fast R-D algorithm,fast SAR image position algorithm,Image resolution,SAR image calibration,maritime target location,SAR image geocoding,R-D pattern,Earth,Imaging,"

Indeed, shipping routes are becoming very crowded and the likelihood of oil slick occurrence is increasing. In this frame, a fully integrated remote sensing system can be a valuable monitoring tool.

"multiple oceanographic hf surface-wave radars applied to maritime surveillance","2014","In the context of maritime surveillance, low-power high-frequency surface-wave (HFSW) radars are attracting significant attention as cost-effective tools for long-range ship detection and tracking applications. In this paper, multi-target tracking and data fusion techniques are applied to live-recorded data from a network of three oceanographic HFSW radars installed on the coast of the German Bight, in the North Sea. This campaign follows a previous one conducted in 2009, in which two HFSW radars were deployed on the coast of the Ligurian Sea, in the Mediterranean. Ship reports from the automatic identification system, recorded from a number of coastal stations, are exploited as ground truth information. A methodology is then applied to classify the fused tracks and to estimate single-sensor and data fusion performances.

"energy-saving resource allocation with lightweight blockchain in maritime wireless communication networks","2020","With the exploration of the ocean resource, establishing an energy-efficient and reliable maritime wireless communication network becomes more and more urgent. In maritime wireless communication networks, data types, such as search and rescue information, business information and surveillance video, will be continuously generated and need to be scheduled and shared. At the same time, there will be some trading needs. How to realize information exchange and ensure safe transactions is an urgent problem to be solved. To this end, this paper aims to establish a distributed network architecture composed of buoys and base stations (BS) at sea, and uses blockchain technology to solve the problem of the completeness of its decentralized network system. To satisfy the computing requirement companied with the blockchain, buoys and BSs in networks also have the computing ability. Due to the fact that buoys deployed in the ocean are hard to be frequently charged, the energy consumption problem is studied in this paper via the joint optimization of the communication resource and computing resource. We combine the weighted shortest processing time first (WSPT) model and the dynamic frequency and voltage scaling (DVFS) energy consumption model to propose an improved energy-saving algorithm.

"remote sensing satellite technology to determine the center of the maritime defense logistics route for securing the indonesian capital city (ikn)","2022","Displacement of the capital of Indonesia has been provided for in Law Number 3 of 2022, namely the IKN Nusantara which is one of the centers of gravity or the center of national strategic strength so that security for the area is very much needed. In order to secure the IKN from all possible enemy attacks, a military defense base is needed that functions as a Logistics support center to support all military operations. The purpose of this study is to determine a strategic location as a center for maritime defense logistics distribution lines in order to secure the IKN area using the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) method combined with satellite image analysis using a Geographic Information System (GIS) by considering the criteria and sub-criteria in determining the location center for maritime defense logistics distribution lines. The results of the research from the AHP weighting method show that the priority order of criteria based on experts is safety from natural conditions, population conditions, environmental locations, distribution line conditions, and required cost. The results of remote sensing satellite image data processing with analysis using Geographic Information Systems with ArcGIS software shows that the results of satellite image overlays are equipped with regional boundaries and routes around IKN. The determination of the location of the center of the distribution line for the defense logistics of the marine sector is concentrated in Samboja District, surely in the Kampung Lama Village which is also used as the location point for the pier plan.

"elemental geochemistry and organic facies of selected cretaceous coals from the benue trough basin in nigeria: implication for paleodepositional environments","2022","Benue Trough basin is geologically subdivided into three segments. It consists of marine and continental sediments that are affected by folding movements. In the upper section, the continental coal-bearing Campano-Maastrichtian-age is found within Gombe Sandstone and the Cenozoic Kerri-Kerri Formation of the Tertiary. In the middle segment, the late Turonian/early Santonian coal-bearing Awgu Formation lies conformably on the Ezeaku Formation. In the lower part, shales at Nkporo mark marine incursion and deposition of the Maastrichtian Mamu Formation coal measures. Cretaceous coal samples taken from the three segments of Benue Trough basin were examined using ultimate and proximate, organic petrographic, x-ray fluorescence (XRF) and laser ablation-induced coupled plasma spectroscopy (LA-ICPMS) analytical techniques. Results of trace element ratios, Ce/Ce* values (“where Ce* is the theoretical Ce value derived from a chondrite-normalized rare earth element (REE) pattern”), authigenic uranium values, and low hydrogen content indicate deposition under oxic to suboxic conditions. However, the V/Ni and V/Sc ratios indicate under oxic, suboxic to reducing conditions. The Y/Ho values for selected coals are lower than the range for seawater, indicating terrigenous influence. The Sr/Ba values indicate low influence of saline water during deposition and a strong continental rather than marine influence. High value of vitrinite and low proportion of liptinite/intertinite suggest that peat in the study areas were situated on the irregular basin floor where sediment thicknesses vary from place to place thus the depositional environments shifted causing mineral matter filling in coal. Based on the tissue preservation index (TPI) and gelification index (GI), LFB, CHK, OKB, LMZ, IMG; and ENG (high GI and high TPI) were deposited in telmatic facies; wet-forest swamps with rapid organic matter accumulation. This trend indicates mild humification and strong gelification of plant tissues which ascribed to high rate of subsidence with wood- and bark-derived telovitrinite. The MGA peats were deposited in terrestrial facies in a dry-forest swamp with wood-derived telo-inertinite. The coal samples code-named IMG and ENG were deposited in planar margin mires. However, coal samples code-named LFB, CHK and LMZ were deposited in planar central mires. Lastly, OKB and MGA were deposited in transitional-wet and transitional-dry mire. The low V and Ni concentrations, low H/C, high O/C, high C/N, and very low N/C ratios <0.05 implies Type III land-plant organic matter that is not oil-prone. The depositional environments interpretations of investigated coal seams indicate that the coals were deposited within a telmatic, limnic, limno-telmatic and open march zone. Generally, a combination of results from inorganic geochemistry and organic petrology is required for precise and all-inclusive determination of coal depositional environments.","Macerals,Coal,Petroleum source evaluation,Benue Trough,Depositional facies,"

"improving group transit schemes to minimize negative effects of maritime piracy","2014","Contemporary maritime piracy around the Horn of Africa presents a serious threat to the global shipping industry. A number of countermeasures were deployed to minimize the probability of a successful ship hijack, one of them being the establishment of the International Recommended Transit Corridor (IRTC). Currently, all ships transiting the Gulf of Aden are recommended to follow the IRTC and take part in group transit schemes (GTSs)-prescribed fixed schedules stating a time of arrival to the beginning of the corridor and a speed at which to sail through the corridor. We provide a number of contributions that improve the GTS: we formalize the grouping problem, we design an efficient algorithm able to compute optimal fixed GTSs with respect to the distribution of ships' speeds, we provide a real-world data set with speeds of ships transiting the IRTC, and we compare the optimal fixed schedules with the currently deployed schedule and quantify possible savings. Additionally, we propose on-demand GTSs-customized schedules for a group of arriving ships-that take into account speeds, risk aversion, and actual positions of arriving ships. We formulate the problem of the optimal on-demand grouping as a biobjective mixed integer program, and we compute a set of Pareto optimal solutions.

"maritime environment perception based on deep learning","2022","Environment perception is an essential aspect of automated maritime vehicles, especially in high-traffic areas. In recent years, deep-learning-based object detection using LiDAR has been well developed in the automotive sector but has not yet seen a similar level of sophisticated development in maritime applications. In these applications, LiDAR detection should be fused with other maritime navigation systems such as the automatic identification system (AIS) to expand the detection range. To address this, we propose a novel deep-learning-based concept for maritime environment perception by using LiDAR as a primary sensor and AIS as an assisting information source. This approach consists of three functional modules: object detection, multi-object tracking, and static environment mapping. For object detection, we apply a convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect floating objects represented as oriented bounding boxes. To train the CNN, we propose a method that generates simulated labeled datasets. The detected objects from CNN are tracked with Kalman Filter banks. The remaining LiDAR data points are treated as static environments and represented by polygons. We evaluated the approach by using simulative and real-world datasets. In the simulation, the average precision of the CNN object detector reaches 60.8%, with a data processing rate of 40 Hz in GPU. Our real-world evaluations show that this approach can track 83% of the vessels in a crowded harbor, with the overall intersection over union reaching 64%.

"influence of the geomagnetic field on the iact detection technique for possible sites of cta observatories","2013","We investigate the influence of the geomagnetic field (GF) on the Imaging Air Cherenkov Telescope technique for two northern (Tenerife and San Pedro Martir) and three southern (Salta, Leoncito and Namibia (the H.E.S.S.-site)) site candidates for Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) observatories. We use the CORSIKA and sim_telarray programs for Monte Carlo simulations of gamma ray showers, hadronic background and the telescope response. We focus here on gamma ray measurements in the low energy, sub-100GeV, range. Therefore, we only consider the performance of arrays of several large telescopes. Neglecting the GF effect, we find (in agreement with previous studies) that such arrays have lower energy thresholds, and larger collection areas below 30GeV, when located at higher altitudes. We point out, however, that in the considered ranges of altitudes and magnetic field intensities, 1800–3600m a.s.l. and 0–40μT, respectively, the GF effect has a similar magnitude to this altitude effect. We provide the trigger-level performance parameters of the observatory affected by the GF effect, in particular the collection areas, detection rates and the energy thresholds for all five locations, which information may be useful in the selection of sites for CTA. We also find simple scaling of these parameters with the magnetic field strength, which can be used to assess the magnitude of the GF effect for other sites; in this work we use them to estimate the performance parameters for five sites: South Africa-Beaufort West, USA-Yavapai Ranch, Namibia-Calapanzi, Chile-La Silla and India-Hanle. We roughly investigate the impact of the geophysical conditions on gamma/hadron separation procedures involving image shape and direction cuts. We note that the change of altitude has an opposite effect at the trigger and analysis levels, i.e. gains in triggering efficiency at higher altitudes are partially balanced by losses in the separation efficiency. In turn, a stronger GF spoils both the shape and the direction discrimination of gamma rays, thus its effects at the trigger and analysis levels add up resulting in a significant reduction of the observatory performance. Overall, our results indicate that the local GF strength at a site can be equally important as its altitude for the low-energy performance of CTA.","Cherenkov light,Imaging Air Cherenkov technique,Monte Carlo simulations,CTA observatory project,Cherenkov detectors,Geomagnetic field,Extensive Air Shower,"
"uav-assisted maritime legitimate surveillance: joint trajectory design and power allocation","2023","This paper investigates a novel maritime wireless surveillance scenario, where a legitimate monitor vessel moves around to eavesdrop the suspicious communication from a suspicious unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to a suspicious vessel with the help of a cooperative UAV. Specifically, the cooperative UAV can adjust its jamming power and trajectory to exactly control the transmission rate of the suspicious link, thus improving the monitor vessel's surveillance performance. Furthermore, since the cooperative UAV cannot land or replenish energy on the sea surface, its jamming power allocation on the ocean should be carefully designed by the energy thresholds. Under such setup, we formulate a sum eavesdropping rate maximization problem, which jointly optimizes the jamming power and three-dimensional (3D) trajectory of the cooperative UAV, as well as the two-dimensional (2D) trajectory of the monitor vessel. To address this non-convex optimization problem, we decompose the design problem into three subproblems and propose an iterative algorithm to find its suboptimal solution. Numerical results show that the proposed jamming-assisted 3D joint design can significantly improve the eavesdropping rate and save the jamming power compared to the benchmark schemes.","Trajectory,Wireless communication,UAV cooperative jamming,trajectory design,Eavesdropping,Surveillance,Autonomous aerial vehicles,Three-dimensional displays,power allocation,Maritime legitimate surveillance,Jamming,"
"context-aware dynamic asset allocation for maritime interdiction operations","2020","This paper validates two approximate dynamic programming approaches on a maritime interdiction problem involving the allocation of multiple heterogeneous assets over a large area of responsibility to interdict multiple drug smugglers using heterogeneous types of transportation on the sea with varying contraband weights. The asset allocation is based on a probability of activity surface, which represents spatio-temporal target activity obtained by integrating intelligence data on drug smuggler whereabouts/waypoints for contraband transportation, behavior models, and meteorological and oceanographic information.

"computationally effective range migration compensation in pcl systems for maritime surveillance","2018","In this paper, we consider the possibility of extending the coherent processing interval (CPI) as a way to improve target detection capability in passive radars for maritime surveillance applications. Despite the low velocity of the considered targets, range walk effects could limit the performance of the system when long CPIs are considered. To overcome these limitations while keeping the computational load controlled, we resort to a sub-optimal implementation of the Keystone Transform (KT), based on Lagrange polynomial interpolation, recently presented by the authors and successfully applied against aerial targets. Following those promising results, we extend the proposed approach to a coastal surveillance scenario. In the considered case, since longer CPI values are used, the proposed strategy appears to be even more attractive with respect to a conventional KT implementation based on the Chirp-Z Transform interpolation. In fact, comparable detection performance are obtained with a remarkable computational load saving. In detail, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated against experimental data provided by Leonardo S.p.A., using a DVB-T based passive radar.","Chirp-Z Transform interpolation,marine radar,aerial targets,radar detection,passive radars,passive radar,transforms,passive coherent location,interpolation,target tracking,range migration compensation,target detection capability,Computational complexity,polynomials,object detection,search radar,digital video broadcasting,radar imaging,Interpolation,computational load saving,PCL systems,Keystone Trasform,DVB-T based passive radar,long coherent processing interval,coherent processing interval,Lagrange polynomial interpolation,Keystone Transform,maritime surveillance applications,Passive radar,walk effects,Signal to noise ratio,Surveillance,CPI values,Transforms,coastal surveillance scenario,KT implementation,"

"large environmental disturbances caused by magmatic activity during the late devonian hangenberg crisis","2020","A wide range of various proxies (e.g., mineralogy, organic carbon, inorganic geochemistry, C and Mo isotopes, and framboidal pyrite) were applied for interpretation of changing oceanic redox conditions, bioproductivity, and the regional history of magmatic activity. This resulted in internally consistent interpretation of the late Famennian Hangenberg Crisis in subtropical deepest water sites of the epeiric Rhenohercynian and Saxo–Thuringian basins, as well as more open sites of the Paleo-Tethys Ocean. High mercury concentrations were detected in all of the studied sections, with the highest values strata in the Carnic Alps (up to 20 ppm) and Thuringia (up to 1.5 ppm). The beginning of the Hg anomaly and the presence of pyroclastic material, indicate that local magmatic activity was initiated before the deposition of the Hangenberg Black Shale (HBS). The onset of the HBS deposition coincided with the expansion of phosphate-enriched, anoxic to euxinic waters during short-lived CO2-greenhouse spike of a warm–humid climate. Intensive magmatic activity was a trigger for climatic changes, an excessive eutrophication, and an accelerated burial of organic carbon during the Hangenberg transgressive pulse. The injection of catastrophic amounts of CO2, toxic elements and acids from volcanic activity could have led to acidification, mutation of spores, and episodes of mass mortality of marine plankton.","Redox conditions,Carbon and molybdenum isotopes,Hangenberg Black Shale,Inorganic geochemistry,Volcanic activity,Mineralogical composition,"
"relations between climate change and mass movement: perspectives from the canadian cordillera and the european alps","2021","Earth's climate is warming and will continue to warm as the century progresses. High mountains and high latitudes are experiencing the greatest warming of all regions on Earth and also are some of the most sensitive areas to climate change, in part because ecosystems and natural processes in these areas are intimately linked to the cryosphere. Evidence is mounting that warming will further reduce permafrost and snow and ice cover in high mountains, which in turn will destabilize many slopes, alter sediment delivery to streams, and change subalpine and alpine ecosystems. This paper contributes to the continuing discussion of impacts of climate change on mountain environments by comparing and discussing processes and trends in the mountains of western Canada and the European Alps. We highlight the effects of physiography and climate on physical processes occurring in the two regions. Processes of interest include landslides and debris flows induced by glacier debuttressing, alpine permafrost thaw, changes in rainfall regime, formation and sudden drainage of glacier- and moraine-dammed lakes, ice avalanches, glacier surges, and large-scale sediment transfers due to rapid deglacierization. Our analysis points out the value of integrating observations and data from different areas of the world to better understand these processes and their impacts.","Cryosphere,Mass movement,European Alps,Canadian Cordillera,Climate change,"

"on gnss jamming threat from the maritime navigation perspective","2019","Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) play a fundamental part on the maritime navigation. Beyond positioning, GNSS is key for the operation of multiple interfaces on the bridge of a ship, compromising the skipper skills to perform traditional navigation. Jamming attacks have been recognized as a major vulnerability for GNSS and their proliferation have raised concerns, given the implication of GNSS into several safety-critical applications. This work provides an overview on the jamming threat and the main countermeasures techniques, especially in the fields of robust signal processing, adaptive antenna arrays and multi sensor fusion. Moreover, the effects of a Personal Privacy Device (PPD) on positioning based on conventional methods using GPS L1 is addressed.

"a strategy for detecting derelict fishing gear at sea","2012","Derelict fishing gear (DFG) is a highly persistent form of marine pollution known to cause environmental and economic damage. At-sea detection of DFG would support pelagic removal of this gear to prevent and minimize impacts on marine environments and species. In 2008, experts in marine debris, oceanography, remote sensing, and marine policy outlined a strategy to develop the capability to detect and ultimately remove DFG from the open ocean. The strategy includes three interrelated components: understanding the characteristics of the targeted DFG, indirectly detecting DFG by modeling likely locations, and directly detecting pelagic DFG using remote sensing. Together, these components aim to refine the search area, increase the likelihood of detection, and decrease mitigation response time, thereby providing guidance for removal operations. Here, we present this at-sea detection strategy, relate it to relevant extant research and technology, and identify gaps that currently prevent successful at-sea detection and removal of DFG.","Remote sensing,Marine debris,Derelict fishing gear,"
"climate change impacts and uncertainty on spatiotemporal variations of drought indices for an irrigated catchment","2021","Droughts are responsible for severe vegetation loss and declining agricultural yields. As future climate change projections imply an increased risk of extreme events, the occurrence of droughts is potentially accelerating in the future. The influence of climate change on drought events in a Danish agricultural catchment under the emission scenario RCP8.5 are evaluated by three different drought indices covering soil moisture, groundwater and streamflow deficits. The indices are based on results from a hydrological model forced by downscaled climate outputs from 16 Euro-CORDEX climate models (GCM-RCMs), while considering uncertainties among climate model projections. The hydrological model demonstrated a satisfactory ability in modelling historical drought characteristics. The results from the future projections showed that the intensity and frequency of droughts increased towards the end of the century. The spatial patterns of changes in drought were found to be highly dependent on the climate model results, index formulations and assumptions, as well as the hydrogeological properties of the catchment. Groundwater based irrigation in the agricultural areas effectively mitigates soil moisture drought, leading to lower future uncertainty of the ensemble mean (higher model agreement) for soil moisture droughts at irrigated locations. This is obtained at the cost of lower groundwater levels in both reference and future periods resulting in larger uncertainties on the simulated groundwater droughts, because of the addition of irrigation uncertainty. While the joint impact of greater groundwater abstraction and changing dynamics of precipitation and groundwater recharge also leads to larger streamflow variability between model combinations (standard deviation) under RCP8.5 for the downstream discharge station.","Uncertainty,Spatiotemporal pattern,Drought indices,Climate change impact,Irrigation impact,Hydrological model,"
"butyltin residues in blue mussels (mytilus edulis) and arkshells (scapharca broughtonii) collected from korean coastal waters","2002","Butyltin compounds (BTs) including tributyltin (TBT) and its degradation products, di- (DBT) and mono-butyltin (MBT), were determined in bivalves such as blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) and arkshells (Scapharca broughtonii) collected from Korean coastal waters. BTs were detected in all the blue mussels and arkshells analyzed. The concentrations of total butyltin (ΣBTs: MBT+DBT+TBT) in blue mussels and arkshells ranged from 49 to 2500 ng/g and 29 to 87 ng/g wet weight, respectively. Higher concentrations of BTs were found in blue mussels collected from Okpo and Kohyonsong Bays and Jangsengpo Harbor where large shipyards and harbors are located with dry-dock facilities. This suggested that maritime activities nearby the harbors play a major role as the source of BTs. Concentrations of TBT in mussels collected from Korea were one of the highest values reported, suggesting ongoing TBT contamination in Korea. Among BTs, TBT was the predominant compound both in blue mussels and arkshells collected from almost all the sampling locations, indicating the fresh input of TBT in Korean coastal waters. Smaller mussels tended to accumulate BTs at higher concentrations than larger ones, which may be due to higher filtration rate of small mussels and/or contact with surface microlayer in intertidal zones.","Blue mussel (),Butyltin compounds,Korean coastal waters,Antifouling paint,TBT,"

"chapter 26 - dealing with space weather: the canadian experience","2018","Space weather phenomena, in the form of the aurora borealis (northern lights), have always been part of the Canadian experience. However, in modern times, we have come to realize how these phenomena can affect the different technological systems on which we rely. High-frequency radio opened up communication links to remote communities, except when the ionosphere was disrupted by space weather disturbances. Such disturbances are now a problem for commercial aircraft using transpolar routes. As long-distance communications shifted to using satellites, Telesat's Anik series of satellites provided phone and television links across the country, but suffered a major blow when energetic electrons damaged the attitude control circuitry for Anik-E2. After heroic efforts to implement an alternative control system, the satellite was brought back into operation 5 months later. On the ground, the expanding power network was vulnerable to the extra currents created during geomagnetic disturbances and on March 13, 1989, a major magnetic storm caused widespread effects, including the blackout of the Hydro-Québec power system. Canadian operators of aeromagnetic surveys and directional drilling have also had to cope with geomagnetic disturbances. Global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) are another technology affected by ionospheric disturbances and a number of correction services have been developed, including the Canadian Coast Guard's DGPS service for maritime users. In parallel with the increasing engineering requirements to design or manage systems in Canada that are affected by space weather, the science behind space weather phenomena has been a particular focus of Canadian scientists who have made great contributions in this area. The same high-latitude location that makes Canada more exposed to space weather hazards also makes it a prime location for space weather observations and the country is now a giant array of space weather research instruments. The challenge for the future is to use the new knowledge being generated to help protect Canadian infrastructure from future extreme space weather events.","Satellites,Radio communications,Space weather,Canada,Surveying and navigation,Power systems and pipelines,"
"petrogeochemical assessment of rock units and identification of alteration/mineralization indicators using portable x-ray fluorescence measurements: applications to the fire tower zone (w-mo-bi) and the north zone (sn-zn-in), mount pleasant deposit, new brunswick, canada","2017","The Mount Pleasant polymetallic deposits are located along the southwestern margin of the Late Devonian Mount Pleasant Caldera Complex in southwestern New Brunswick, Canada. The Fire Tower Zone (W-Mo-Bi) and the North Zone (Sn-Zn-In) comprise the main mineralized zones within the Mount Pleasant deposit. The rock units examined at surface in both zones are highly altered and are surface weathered to some extent. In order to classify these rock units with confidence, the Olympus X-5000 portable X-ray Fluorescence (pXRF) spectrometer was used in this study to rapidly obtain the geochemical composition of these rocks, identify lithologic discriminants, and find alteration/mineralization indicators in these areas. The immobile elements Ti, Zr, Nb, Y, and Th were selected to discriminate among various rock types. The Little Mount Pleasant Formation has the highest Ti and Zr and the Mount Pleasant Granitic Suite (MPGS, GI and GII) contains the highest Y, Nb, and Th. The McDougall Brook Granitic Suite (MBGS) has an intermediate composition between them. The element ratios of Zr/Ti, Nb/Ti, Y/Ti, and Th/Ti effectively discriminate these rock units and increase from the Little Mount Pleasant Formation, to the MBGS, and then to the MPGS. Greisen and propylitic alteration are reflected by strong depletion of K and Rb in some samples. The Fe and Mn typically are leached out of the mineralization system during the greisen alteration. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed on the pXRF datasets. The first principal component (PC1) of the pXRF data from both the Fire Tower Zone and the North Zone mainly extracts information on Ti, Zr, Ce, Cr, V, Nb, Y, U, and Th, and thus represents different rock units. The PC2 is characterized by high-positive loadings of K, Rb, Fe, and Mn and negative loading of As and Mo. It is interpreted as the W-Mo mineralization indicator showing by the enrichment in Mo and depletion of K, Rb, Fe, and Mn associated with quartz+topaz+sericite+fluorite alteration. The PC3 consists of positive loadings of Sn, Zn, Cu, and S and slightly negative loadings of Sr and Ba, and thus represents the Sn-Zn mineralization in this area.","Immobile elements,Lithogeochemistry,XRF,PCA,Mount Pleasant deposit,"
"cycling of biogenic elements drives biogeochemical gold cycling","2019","Microorganisms are key-drivers of carbon-, nitrogen-, sulfur- and metal cycling on Earth. Through their metabolic activities they directly and indirectly link element cycles. This leads to the cycling of elements through the Earth’s ecosystems from/to the atmosphere to/from the lithosphere. Gold (Au) is a rare, redox-active, noble transition metal, which is neither essential as a nutrient nor, reputedly, mobile in the environment. Therefore, observations published in recent decades, which have shown that gold is highly mobile and subject to biogeochemical cycling largely driven by microbiota, have surprised many. Questions concerning the fundamental biogeochemical processes mediating gold cycling, the organisms involved and the benefits they may gain have puzzled researchers. In this review we integrate the cycling of the major biogenic elements carbon, nitrogen and sulfur with that of gold. We identify key-processes that drive gold cycling and evaluate how different chemical Au(I/III)-species affect microbiota that form biofilms on gold-bearing minerals and placer gold particles. Additionally, we assess how the cycling of the gold-associated metal(loid)s silver, copper, iron, manganese, mercury and arsenic is linked to that of gold. Microbially produced compounds resulting from carbon, nitrogen, sulfur, iron and manganese cycling (e.g., organic acids, cyanides, (thio)sulfates, ammonium, iron sulfides/oxy-hydroxides and managanese oxides) can each play important roles for the mobilization of gold. Highly toxic, mobile Au(I/III)-complexes affect the phylogenetic and functional composition of microbial communities resident on gold particles. This leads to gold detoxification coupled to active and passive biomineralization, and ultimately the aggregation and (trans)formation of metallic gold particles. The complex interplay between gold, microbiota and physicochemical conditions modified by these organisms (e.g., redox or pH) has throughout the Earth’s history led to the aggregation of gold particles (grains to nuggets), led to the formation of the largest known gold deposit (i.e., Witwatersrand paleo-placer), and the largest gold reservoir in seawater. Today it opens up exciting biotechnological pathways for mineral exploration, processing and remediation.","Microorganisms,Carbon,Intercycle coupling,Gold,Bacteria,Nitrogen,Biogeochemistry,Sulfur,Element cycles,"
"twenty years of nasa-eos multi-sensor satellite observations at kīlauea volcano (2000–2019)","2021","Recent eruptions of Kīlauea volcano, on the Island of Hawai'i, represent an ideal test location for studying volcanic plumes, due to its remote location and minimal anthropogenic pollution. Within this work we exploit the over 20-year data record from NASA EOS satellites to investigate the degree to which space-borne observations can detect shifts in known eruption dynamics at Kīlauea. Through the combined analysis of remotely sensed plume heights, plume particle microphysical properties, lava flow thermal tracking and high resolution SO2 mapping, we provide interpretations of the satellite signals in a volcanic context and link them to ground-based eruption reports for validation. We establish common patterns of plume dispersion and particle evolution and identify when significant shifts in activity occur. We also determine where ambient conditions influence the output retrieved from the space-borne sensors. By comparing the inferences derived from remote-sensing with the extensive record of suborbital observations at Kīlauea, we assess the strengths and limitations of the satellite-based volcanic assessment techniques. The work presented here highlights the capabilities of these techniques, allowing us to more confidently interpret volcanic activity observed from space globally, particularly in cases where ground observations are limited or entirely lacking.","Eruption tracking,Volcano remote sensing,Kīlauea,NASA earth observing system,TROPOMI,MODIS,MISR,"

"tensor-based approach for background-foreground separation in maritime sequences","2021","The complexity of a scene in addition to the need for real-time processing are the main challenges that face any background/foreground separation approach for maritime environment. Recent studies on Low-rank and Sparse Separation (LSS) achieved good performance when compared to traditional background subtraction techniques in segregating the foreground from a complex background. However, the issue of maintaining this type of a separation via an updating mechanism is not well addressed by the majority of LSS approaches. The study presents a tensor based singular value decomposition approach for background/foreground separation. The approach is uniquely designed to deal with most challenges related to a maritime environment such as sea dynamics, boat wakes, variety of foreground objects, and camera jitter. Furthermore, the proposed approach operates incrementally via updating the separation components as opposed to reperforming the decomposition on the entire video sequence when a set of frames arrives. Additionally, a forgetting mechanism is employed in the proposed approach to efficiently handle challenges such as Stationary Foreground Objects (SFOs) and ghost effects. The performance of the proposed method with several state-of-the-art LSS and Non-LSS techniques on videos with complex maritime scenarios are evaluated. The results exhibit better performance over most of the tested challenges and also demonstrate the capability of the proposed method to perform the separation in less computational time.","background-foreground separation,Maritime environment,Cameras,singular value decomposition,Matrix decomposition,tensors,incremental update,video sequence,ghost effects,forgetting mechanism,blind source separation,Sea surface,Real-time systems,maritime sequences,video signal processing,image sequences,Minimization,tensor-based approach,Computational modeling,stationary foreground objects,background subtraction,image segmentation,low-rank and sparse separation,Dynamics,"

The whole simulating process can be divided into two phases: pre-computing phase and real-time computing phase.

In real-time computing phase, a small height field surrounding the viewpoint is generated using the Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) based method every frame. The wave parameters used in the FFT-based method are dynamically changed according to viewpointâ€™s projective position on the coarse grid. Then, the height field is saved as a vertex texture, which can be tiled in horizontal directions seamlessly. At last, the vertex texture is sampled by a sector sea surface, which is viewpoint-dependent and has Level Of Detail (LOD) effect.

"a wideband satellite maritime channel model simulator","2022","In this article, we present implementation details of a generative satellite maritime propagation channel model at L-band. In an earlier paper, we presented the parameterization of the channel model for the narrowband case based on recordings of GPS L1  $C/N_{0}$  time-series in different sea state conditions. Additionally, we performed wider band measurements using GPS E5a (â‰ˆ10 Mcpsâ€”chips per secondâ€” > 20 MHz bandwidth) and obtained estimations of power delay profiles. Due to lack of dynamic range and delay resolution, in these measurements, no conclusive information was gathered on the time spreading caused by the channel. What was clear is that the time spreading was not significant outside the first signal chip, i.e.,  $\approx 0.1~\mu \text{s}$ . Still wideband modeling is required within this spreading range. Now, we want to extend the model to the wideband case. To achieve this goal, we have used a rough surface scattering model applicable to sea surfaces and employed it to characterize the time dispersion to be expected. Additionally, we also used this scattering model to help verify the validity of the existing Doppler spread model. Furthermore, ship movements in the waves play a role. We try and analyze this issue. Finally, we present a detailed discussion on various implementation issues we came across when coding the simulator.","delay resolution,power delay profiles,satellite maritime propagation channel model,sea surface,wider band measurements,Global Positioning System,Modeling,Sea measurements,Rough surfaces,wideband,wideband modeling,dynamic range,satellite communication,time dispersion,Scattering,time 0.1 mus,ships,wideband satellite maritime channel model simulator,radiowave propagation,earlier paper,narrowband case,scattering,Sea surface,Wideband,rough surface scattering model,Sea state,rough surfaces,Doppler effect,wireless channels,signal chip,spreading range,sea surfaces,different sea state conditions,wideband case,existing Doppler spread model,Surface roughness,broadband networks,frequency 20.0 MHz,marine communication,radio receivers,L-band,"
"a flexible web traffic generator for the dimensioning of a 5g backhaul in npn","2023","Web-based services have nowadays aggregated the majority of applications, ranging from multimedia delivery to instant messaging, embracing requirements from different classes of users (i.e., gamers, streamers, professionals, etc.). The common factor is the need for connectivity everywhere and every time at high performance and quality, while the services traffic profiles and the users’ behaviour can be drastically different. This need is fully satisfied by the recent 5G mobile networks, where the coexistence of heterogeneous applications with different Quality of Service (QoS) levels is possible, defining new vertical markets and cutting-edge applications. In this context, we propose a Flexible Web Traffic Generator (FWTG) tool to model the dynamics of recent applications and user interactions in a realistic way, allowing the generation of real-time HTTP traffic and the possibility to inject it into real networks. FTWG represents a valid in-laboratory solution for the rapid configuration and applications performance evaluation of network slices in the context of 5G Non-Public Networks (NPN), pursuing an effective emulation approach. The advantage of this approach is that it allows the evaluation of real traffic response to different network configurations (and vice-versa), using components, equipment and network functions of the target network under test. After the description of the rationale and the methodology for defining FWTG models and their implementation, we defined a set of Key Performance Indicators (KPI) generated by the tool (e.g., number of requested objects and size, request rate, throughput, etc.). Then, we present initial validation tests on a Linux-based testbed representing the 5G-based scenarios of interest, emulating also a satellite backhaul as representative of a use-case requiring cost-effective dimensioning. Numerical outcomes of running FWTG in different configurations are then provided, considering a variation of the number of users sharing the same resources, their composition and traffic type, showing with concrete examples the usefulness and flexibility of FWTG in supporting 5G network configuration optimizations. Definitively, the tool is released as Open Source software on Gitlab.","QoS,Web traffic generation,5G,NPN backhaul,"
"detection of aeromagnetic anomaly change associated with volcanic activity: an application of the generalized mis-tie control method","2009","Repeat aeromagnetic surveys may assist in mapping and monitoring long-term changes associated with volcanic activity. However, when dealing with repeat aeromagnetic survey data, the problem of how to extract the real change of magnetic anomalies from a limited set of observations arises, i.e. the problem of spatial aliasing. Recent development of the generalized mis-tie control method for aeromagnetic surveys flown at variable elevations enables us to statistically extract the errors from ambiguous noise sources. This technique can be applied to overcome the spatial alias effect when detecting magnetic anomaly changes between aeromagnetic surveys flown at different times. We successfully apply this technique to Asama Volcano, one of the active volcanoes in Japan, which erupted in 2004. Following the volcanic activity in 2005, we conducted a helicopter-borne aeromagnetic survey, which we compare here to the result from a previous survey flown in 1992. To discuss small changes in magnetic anomalies induced by volcanic activity, it is essential to estimate the accuracy of the reference and the repeat aeromagnetic measurements and the probable errors induced by data processing. In our case, the positioning inaccuracy of the 1992 reference survey was the most serious factor affecting the estimation of the magnetic anomaly change because GPS was still in an early stage at that time. However, our analysis revealed that the magnetic anomaly change over the Asama Volcano area from 1992 to 2005 exceeded the estimated error at three locations, one of which is interpreted as a loss of magnetization induced by volcanic activity. In this study, we suffered from the problem of positioning inaccuracy in the 1992 survey data, and it was important to evaluate its effect when deriving the magnetic anomaly change.","Magnetic anomaly change,V olcanic activity,Aeromagnetic anomalies,Asama Volcano,Mis-tie control method,"
"anomaly detection and assessment of pm10 functional data at several locations in the klang valley, malaysia","2015","In environmental data sets, the occurrence of a high concentration of an unusual pollutant, more formally known as an anomaly, may indicate air quality problems. Thus, a critical understanding of the behavior of anomalies is increasingly becoming very important for air pollution investigations. This study was conducted to detect anomalies in daily PM10 functional data, to investigate the patterns of behavior as well as to identify possible factors that determine PM10 anomalies at three selected air quality monitoring stations (Klang, Kuala Selangor and Petaling Jaya) in the Klang Valley, Malaysia. The statistical method employed to detect these anomalies consisted of a combination of the robust projection pursuit and the robust Mahalanobis distance methods using air quality data recorded from 2005 to 2010. Analysis of obtained anomalous PM10 profiles showed that data recorded during El Nino years (2005, 2006 and 2009) contained the highest frequency of anomalies. More frequent anomalies appeared during the southwest (SW) monsoon which occurs in the months of July and August as well as during the northeast (NE) monsoon in February. A lesser number of anomalies were also observed during weekends compared to weekdays. The weekend and monsoonal effect phenomena were shown to be significantly existent at all stations while wind speed was positively associated with extreme PM10 anomalies at the Klang and Petaling Jaya stations. In conclusion, anomalies detection was found useful for air pollution investigation in this study. The findings of this study imply that the location and background of a station, as well as wind speed, seasonal (monsoon) and weekdays-weekend variations play important role in influencing PM10 anomalies.","anomaly detection,air quality monitoring,PM,functional data,"
"a fault detector/classifier for closed-ring power generators using machine learning","2021","Condition-based monitoring of power-generation systems is naturally becoming a standard approach in industry due to its inherent capability of fast fault detection, thus improving system efficiency and reducing operational costs. Most such systems employ expertise-reliant rule-based methods. This work proposes a different framework, in which machine-learning algorithms are used for detecting and classifying several fault types in a power-generation system of dynamically positioned vessels. First, principal component analysis is used to extract relevant information from labeled data. A random-forest algorithm then learns hidden patterns from faulty behavior in order to infer fault detection from unlabeled data. Results on fault detection and classification for the proposed approach show significant improvement on accuracy and speed when compared to results from rule-based methods over a comprehensive database.","Random forests,Condition-based monitoring,Classification,Principal components,Machine learning,Detection,"

"energy-efficient task offloading of edge-aided maritime uav systems","2023","This paper considers the autonomous detecting and tracking task of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in the maritime environment. Due to the high computational complexity of the image-processing task, the strict latency requirement of the tracking task, and the shortage of batteries and computational capability of UAVs, the UAVs can offload the computing-intensive task to the edge computing server (ECS) to reduce the task latency and energy consumption. Even though, the large latency and energy consumption brought by some high-definition image-processing task still make some visual tracking difficult to perform. We first investigate the impact of video frame resolution on computing task size and detection accuracy, and further on task latency and energy consumption. In addition, we optimize the transmission power, the local CPU frequency, the offloading rate of UAVs, and the bandwidth allocation between UAVs. We model the UAVs tracking system as an energy consumption optimization problem with the constraint of task latency. Although the proposed optimization problem is complex, we transform the optimization problem into several subproblems with decoupling and rigorous mathematical proof. By combining the convex optimization with the genetic algorithm, an offloading algorithm with low complexity and good performance is obtained, which is verified by comparing with some benchmark offloading strategies in the numerical results.","unmanned aerial vehicles,Image edge detection,energy-efficient task offloading,remotely operated vehicles,image resolution,Energy consumption,convex programming,control engineering computing,bandwidth allocation,transmission power optimization,genetic algorithms,detection accuracy,edge computing server,genetic algorithm,Energy resolution,strict latency requirement,Target tracking,optimisation,edge computing,local CPU frequency,tracking task,UAV computational capability,visual tracking,high-definition image-processing task,mathematical proof,offload,visual target tracking,power aware computing,computing task size,edge-aided maritime UAV systems,autonomous aerial vehicles,Optimization,Edge computing,maritime environment,energy consumption,Image resolution,computational complexity,energy consumption optimization problem,Task analysis,computing-intensive task,ECS,UAV,"
"a multi-task learning-based framework for global maritime trajectory and destination prediction with ais data","2022","Automatic Identification System (AIS) was initially developed for tracking ships and avoiding collisions. As numerous small satellites were launched in recent years, millions of AIS messages are captured by these satellite AIS providers every day. The massive amount of data allow shipping firms and port operators to better predict vessels’ movement. In this study, a computational framework is developed to predict future trajectories and destinations of vessels by applying deep learning to the satellite AIS messages containing self-reporting positioning data. We employed deep learning approaches for large-scale maritime prediction and identifies the most suitable deep neural networks for this specific application. Three prediction models, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Dense Neural Networks (DNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) have been tested in the framework. A multi-task learning architecture is implemented based on test results. Through sharing parameters while training, this architecture enables long-term destination predictions by balancing short-term trajectory predictions. The framework is validated globally with the experiments covering five large-scale sea areas. The experimental results demonstrate that the LSTM model with an average accuracy percentage of 85.1% outperforms the CNN and DNN with accuracy percentages of 68.3% and 78.2% respectively. The LSTM model with multi-task architecture can achieve an accuracy of 87.0%. With the proposed computational framework, AIS data can be utilized for maritime predictions, supporting more complex marine applications and covering more expansive geographic areas.","Vessel trajectory prediction,Automatic Identification System,Vessel origin–destination analysis,Vessel destination prediction,"
"maritime ship target imaging with gnss-based passive multistatic radar","2023","In the field of maritime surveillance, the global navigation satellite system (GNSS)-based passive radar has proven its potential for moving target detection (MTD), localization, and velocity estimation. The next stage is to investigate the possibility of obtaining the radar image of the moving ship for target recognition. However, the limited signal power budget of GNSS prevents the conventional inverse synthetic aperture radar technique that is based on target rotational motion and short observation time for GNSS-based passive radar imaging moving target. In this article, a two-stage imaging processing method relying on the target translational motion over a long observation time is proposed. The first stage confirms the presence of the target by a long-time MTD processing technique. In the second stage, based on the analysis of the Doppler history of the target signal in the slow-time domain, short-time Fourier transform and modified random sample consensus are combined to robustly estimate target velocity with reduced computation complexity. To obtain the focused bistatic image, azimuth compression is conducted by using the estimated target velocity. Finally, an image fusion operation is implemented to combine the bistatic images achievable from multiple satellites so that a multistatic image with high quality can be created. The effectiveness of the proposed method is confirmed by the real experimental results of three cargo ships illuminated by several satellites.","moving ship,Fourier transforms,inverse synthetic aperture radar technique,focused bistatic image,GNSS-based passive multistatic radar,short-time Fourier transform,target detection,passive radar,Marine vehicles,image fusion operation,short observation time,long observation time,maritime ship target imaging,cargo ships,image fusion,target velocity estimation,ships,satellite navigation,maritime surveillance,estimated target velocity,two-stage imaging processing method,object detection,passive radar imaging,synthetic aperture radar,bistatic images,target rotational motion,radar imaging,Doppler effect,Radar,target translational motion,velocity estimation,Global navigation satellite system (GNSS)-based passive radar,Passive radar,Radar imaging,GNSS-based passive radar,target signal,Imaging,long-time MTD processing technique,slow-time domain,radar image,target recognition,multistatic image,Global navigation satellite system,global navigation satellite system-based passive radar,"
"research and application of artificial intelligence techniques for wire arc additive manufacturing: a state-of-the-art review","2023","Recent development in the Wire arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) provides a promising alternative for fabricating high value-added medium to large metal components for many industries such as aerospace and maritime industry. However, challenges stemming from the demand for increasingly complex and high-quality products, hinder the widespread adoption of the conventional WAAM method for manufacturing industries. The development of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques may provide new opportunities to upgrade WAAM to the next generation. Hence, this paper provides a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art research on AI techniques in WAAM. Firstly, we proposed a novel concept of intelligent wire arc additive manufacturing (IWAAM) and revealed the challenges of developing IWAAM. Secondly, an overview of the research progress of applying AI techniques to several aspects of the WAAM process chain, including fabrication process pre-design, online deposition control and offline parameter optimization is provided. Thirdly, the relevant machine learning algorithms, and the knowledge of corresponding AI techniques, are also reviewed in detail. Through reviewing the current research articles, issues of applying AI techniques to the WAAM process are presented and analysed. Finally, future research perspectives in terms of novel AI technique applications and AI technique enhancement are discussed. Through this systematic review, it is expected that WAAM may gradually develop into a smart/intelligent manufacturing technology in the context of Industry 4.0 through the adoption of AI techniques.","Algorithm,Artificial intelligence (AI),Intelligent manufacturing,Wire arc additive manufacturing (WAAM),Machine learning,"
"ship classification based on ship behavior clustering from ais data","2019","Since the introduction of the Automatic Identification System (AIS), AIS data has proven to be a valuable source of ship behavior analysis using data mining. It records ship position, speed and other behavior attributes at specific time intervals in all voyages at sea and in ports. However, the current studies in ship behavior analyze the behavior patterns either with a subjective choice of classification for behavior differences among the groups of ships or without any classification at all. In order to fill this gap, a new methodology for ship classification in ports based on behavior clustering is developed by analyzing AIS data from the port of Rotterdam. Besides a proper data preparation, the proposed methodology consists of two steps: step I, clustering ship behavior in a port area and identifying the characteristics of the clusters; step II, classifying ships to such behavior clusters based on the ship characteristics. The clustering results present both the behavior patterns and the behavior change patterns for ship path and speed over ground, which are the dominant behavior attributes for ships in ports. Some patterns of integral ship behavior can also be revealed by investigating the correlation between the two behavior attributes. Our research has shown that length and beam can be adopted as explanatory variable to classify ships to the corresponding behavior clusters. The classifiers are developed based on both unsupervised discretization (equal width binning) and supervised discretization (Chi2). The performances of classifiers are compared by three evaluation metrics, including Average Accuracy, F1score, and AUC. We found that the classification based on multi-criteria is more accurate than using a single criterion. The classifications based on Chi2 discretization outperform the ones with equal width discretization. The outcome leads to a systematic understanding of ship behavior in a port area and can be used to predict the ship behavior pattern based on their characteristics and simulate the ship behavior.","Ship classification,Ports and waterways,Behavior clustering,Data mining,AIS data,"
"spatio-temporal dynamics of the río de la plata turbidity front; combining remote sensing with in-situ measurements and numerical modeling","2021","The Río de la Plata is a micro-tidal estuary located in Southeast South America. With an annual mean flow of 26,500 m3/s, it receives 160 million tons/yr of suspended sediments. The high content of cohesive fine sediments in the estuary generates high turbidity levels in its inner and intermediate zones, which can be clearly seen in color satellite images. In this work, an image-based algorithm was successfully implemented to remotely detect the turbidity front of the Río de la Plata, based on the top of the atmosphere (TOA) reflectance in the red band of MODIS-Aqua satellite. The algorithm finds the reflectance level that ‘best’ separates two water classes: turbid fluvial and clear ocean waters. The front dynamic was studied combining remotely sensed information and data of river discharge, winds, salinity and sea level time series, in the four-year period 2014–2017. River discharge was identified as the main external forcing, revealing a solid general pattern of behavior: when discharge was high (low) the front tended to be located in the outer (intermediate) zone of the estuary. Sea level seemed to be a secondary forcing, presenting higher correlations along the center of the estuary than near both coasts. Local winds needed to have a relatively persistent (2-day) component in a given direction to affect the location of the front. Additionally, results of an already implemented numerical model of the Río de la Plata were evaluated in terms of spatio-temporal performance, considering turbidity and salinity fronts locations. New strengths and limitations of the model were identified, and an improvement in the parameterization of sediments’ settling velocity was tested. Model results revealed the relative importance of bottom shear stress on the general location of the front, and of salinity on the flocculation process of cohesive sediments. This work provided new insights for the understanding of the Río de la Plata estuarine dynamics through the combination of three complementary tools – remote sensing, in situ data, and numerical modeling, – which may be extended to other systems around the world.","Satellite images,Discharge,Hydro-sedimentological model,Wind,Suspended sediments,Salinity,Sea surface level,Estuary,MODIS,"
"anatomically preserved plants in siderite concretions in the shale split of the foord seam: mineralogy, geochemistry, genesis (upper carboniferous, canada)","1999","A shale split in the well-studied Foord Seam (Upper Carboniferous), Stellarton Basin, Nova Scotia, provides a rare opportunity to study little known siderite concretions with anatomically preserved plants from a limnic basin. Siderite concretions occur throughout the split, commonly as sheet-like, inter-connected lepidodendrid logs, or less frequently as spherical masses; they are typically vuggy. A sample of 14 stratigraphically oriented concretions in the split shows that primary siderite varies from 45% to 80% (wt.%) due to selective replacement by 5% to 40% ferroan dolomite or ankerite in plant tissues. These two minerals show large Mg/Fe and Mg/Ca variability and are Fezoned. Clay content ranges from trace to 20%, and quartz from 5% to 10%. Partial cell-wall destruction by erosion and changeable oxic/anoxic conditions, prior to siderite permineralization, resulted in preservation mainly of the more resistant plant tissues. On average, carbon from siderite is isotopically heavier (+4.8±1.9 0/00) than that from `dolomite' (−7.2±1.1 0/00). The distribution of and the positive correlation between δ13C and δ18O probably reflects the two fractionation processes associated with methanogenesis and `dolomitization', respectively, in the genetic history of the siderite concretions in the split. Siderite concretions formed diagenetically early from bicarbonate under reducing conditions in a slightly alkaline freshwater environment that precluded calcite deposition.","genesis,mineralogy,anatomically preserved plants,Carboniferous siderite concretions,"
"mining regular behaviors based on multidimensional trajectories","2016","In the information fusion domain, mining regular behaviors is very important to task classification, anomaly behavior detection, situation assessment and threat estimation. Through clustering multidimensional trajectories which are accumulated in all kinds of electronic information systems, regular behaviors could be mined. Most of the trajectories clustering methods are clustering spatial position closed trajectories to a cluster. They cannot distinguish behaviors whose space position is similar but the moving speed and direction are quite different. Some sub-trajectory clustering methods which presented similarity measures considering segment direction, speed, and angle could solve this problem, but they are not suitable to some application scenarios which should clustering the whole trajectories. In this paper, we proposed a multidimensional trajectory clustering algorithm to mine regular behaviors by considering the attribute, type, position, velocity and course characteristics, and implement it on two experiments. This research is very helpful for mining all the regular behaviors in different application scenarios and would have a wide prospect in expert and intelligent systems.","Hausdorff distance,Multidimensional trajectory,Clustering,Regular behavior,"

Two multi-institutional, multi-instrument campaigns, one under ‘Space Weather: Science and Applications’ and the other emphasizing tides under ‘Atmospheric Coupling Processes’ were conducted during February–April 2006. The highlights of the campaigns include improved prediction of equatorial spread-F (ESF) based on a ‘new factor’ combining the strength and asymmetry of the equatorial ionization anomaly (EIA); simultaneous detection of quasi-2-day wave at both E and F region heights; tomographic image showing a Traveling Ionospheric Disturbance (TID) in association with a counter electrojet (CEJ) event—all highlighting the neutral and electrodynamical coupling of the equatorial ionosphere−thermosphere regions; an unusual lowering of mesospheric temperature during a moderate geomagnetic storm—highlighting a new space weather effect; diurnal tide showing a peak amplitude of 35m/s at 45km in zonal wind and a significantly lower amplitude (∼15m/s) in the meridional wind and also evidence of convective activity in the lower atmosphere influencing the tidal variability in the Mesosphere−Lower Thermosphere (MLT) region highlighting the vertical coupling of the atmospheric regions. The development of models for equatorial and low latitude ionosphere has been among the prime activities taken up under ‘Space Climate’. Two models have been developed towards this end: one based on Second Degree (SD) relationships of F region parameters to the mean sun spot number and the other a Multiple Regression Analysis (MRA) based model involving expressions relating F region parameters to that representing solar and geomagnetic activities. The two models, intended for long and short term predictions, have been found to represent the equatorial and low latitude ionosphere over Indian longitudes better than the commonly used International Reference Ionosphere (IRI).

"perturbation analysis for maritime applications","2012","Target detection of marine features is a major topic for the security and monitoring of coastlines. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) has been shown to be particularly useful because of its all-weather and night capability. In this paper a methodology based on the perturbation analysis developed by the authors is presented. The latter can be applied for detection of ships (non-marine targets) or classification of sea ice. The algorithm can be considered to be a negative filter focused on sea. Consequently, all the features which have a polarimetric behaviour different from the sea are detected and considered as targets. A complete validation with RADARSAT-2 full polarimetric data was performed in Portsmouth, UK. An accurate ground truth carried out during the acquisition, was accompanied, considering AIS GPS location and photographic evidences. Moreover, a map of the buoys helped locating this typology of targets.

"adaptive mission planning for cooperative autonomous maritime vehicles","2013","This paper addresses the problem of developing an autonomous cooperative multi-vehicle system composed of one simple low-cost unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV) guided by a more capable, sensor-equipped, surface or underwater vehicle. Specifically, in this work we consider a system composed of an autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) able to localize a small-sized UUV via a multibeam sonar and, then, to guide it via an acoustic link to reach a target. The UUV is equipped with low-cost navigation sensors (a compass and a depth sensor), and to estimate its own position relies on the data received by the ASV (range and bearing from the ASV and ASV position). This paradigm was applied in the domain of mine countermeasures (MCM) to realize the NATO CMRE Autonomous Mine Neutralization System. In this system the low-cost feature of the UUV is of the most importance since the UUV is supposed to be expendable. In this approach, however, there may be cases in which the underwater vehicle cannot be detected by the sonar for extended time periods causing drifts in the UUV position estimate, potentially compromising the mission. This paper presents a set of behaviors to address this situation. The behaviors coordinate ASV circular search patterns together with sending to the UUV purposely generated navigation updates. The aim is to limit the distance between the two vehicles, increasing the probability of sonar reacquisition, and at the same time ensuring that the UUV progresses toward the target. Results from sea trials held in Elba island (Italy) during ANT12 experiments (in June 2012) are reported, and demonstrate the approach is effective and can push our system toward full autonomy.","autonomous cooperative multivehicle system,mine countermeasures domain,low-cost navigation sensors,ANT12 experiments,multi-robot systems,control engineering computing,small-sized UUV,NATO CMRE Autonomous Mine Neutralization System,ASV position bearing,Elba island,Italy,Sonar navigation,navigation updates,Vehicles,sonar reacquisition probability,autonomous surface vehicle,Three-dimensional displays,software architecture,adaptive mission planning,autonomous underwater vehicles,simple low-cost unmanned underwater vehicle,time periods,ASV circular search patterns,compass,Sonar,vehicle distance,sensors,sonar,multibeam sonar,Acoustics,depth sensor,path planning,cooperative autonomous maritime vehicles,ASV,mobile robots,MCM domain,Sensors,ASV position range,acoustic link,sensor position estimation,"

These enhancements include many applications for the better management and operation of vessels and they are needed more than ever because of world merchant fleet expansion. Just the top 20 world ships registers have about 40,000 units under their national flags. Above all, the biggest problem today is that merchant ships and their crews are targets of the types of crime traditionally associated with the maritime industries, such as piracy, robbery and recently, a target for terrorist attacks.

The best way to implement ISPS is to design an Approaching and Port Control System (APCS) by special code augmentation satellite CNS including tracking and monitoring of all vehicle circulation in and out of the port area. The establishment of MTAS as a part of Global Satellite Augmentation Systems (GSAS) or GNSS-1, such as the US WAAS, European EGNOS, Japanese MSAS, Chinese SNAS, Indian GAGAN and future GSAS including African Satellite Augmentation System (ASAS) will meet all these requirements and will complement the services already provided by DGPS or Local VHF Augmentation System (LVAS) and MF radio beacons.","satellite CNS,MTAS,APCS,port area,Satellite navigation systems,Transportation,hovercrafts,US WAAS,Communication system security,GLONASS,GSAS,ISPS,Marine vehicles,Global Positioning System,European EGNOS,navigation and surveillance,Radio navigation,African satellite augmentation system,Satellite communication,crew security,marine safety,satellite navigation,cruisers,maritime transportation augmentation system,International Ship and Port Security,boats,Distributed control,Chinese SNAS,GPS,Satellite broadcasting,GNSS-1,safety systems,world merchant fleet expansion,Indian GAGAN,satellite communications,mobile satellite communication,Global Satellite Augmentation Systems,marine communication,Approaching and Port Control System,Control systems,board ships,terrorist attacks,special code augmentation satellite CNS,marine vehicles,Japanese MSAS,local VHF augmentation system,MF radio beacons,digital selective call,"
"deep learning aided beam vector assignment for massive mimo maritime communication considering location information and handover impact","2022","Location aided beamforming (LAB) has been proposed as a potential solution to fast beam vector (BV) selection for massive multi-input multi-output (M-MIMO) maritime communication systems. However, the existing LAB schemes hardly consider the impact from handover. In this paper, we propose to apply the Gaussian anomaly detection (GAD) to improve the system performance, particularly in the handover zone, by exploiting the information of sea lane and locations of the user equipment (UE). Furthermore, inspired by the rationale of deep learning (DL) aided image processing methods, we first transform the BV assignment problem to a location-based artificial gray value classification problem, and then utilize a convolutional deep belief networks (CDBN) to predict the BV indices from a predefined codebook constituted by location-related feature matrices. In addition, we exploit GAD to rectify the training data of CDBN, such that the prediction on BV assignments can be more accurate to achieve a higher capacity than known methods. Finally, an extensive comparison with selected existing schemes through simulations demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.","Convolutional deep belief network (CDBN),Maritime communication,Deep learning (DL),Massive multiple input multiple output (M-MIMO),Gaussian anomaly detection (GAD),"
"vessel manoeuvring hot zone recognition and traffic analysis with ais data","2022","Automatic identification systems (AIS) are on-board compulsory devices on ships that can provide a large amount of dynamic vessel information, such as position, course and speed information, which is meaningful for marine management. This paper explores the potential to utilize AIS data to recognize ship manoeuvring hot zones and analyse their characteristics to improve marine management efficiency. First, considering manoeuvring behaviours such as turning, acceleration and deceleration, a novel approach based on MiniBatchKMeans that recognizes ship turning hot zones, acceleration hot zones and deceleration hot zones is proposed according to course and speed variation. Second, joint probability density functions for speed over ground (SOG) and course over ground (COG) are built taking into account the combined influences of motion characteristics, which are beneficial for determining the ship traffic rules in manoeuvring hot zones and utilized in marine management. Finally, numerical and comparison experiments are conducted to test the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method.","Vessel manoeuvring,Cluster,AIS,Hot zone,Joint probability density function,"

"designing intelligent coastal surveillance based on big maritime data","2020","The ocean is classified into several territorial regimes that span from internal waters, archipelagic waters, territorial seas, contiguous zones, exclusive economic zones (EEZ), and high seas. The relevant state authorities must perform surveillance of all ships that navigate through their respective territories to ensure the ship safety and prevent them from carrying out illegal activities such as illegal unregulated and unreported (IUU) fishing, illegal firearms smuggling, and piracy. Currently, maritime domain surveillance is carried out using a combination of Automatic Identification System (AIS), Coastal Radar System (CRS), and Long Range Camera (LRC). The massive amount of incoming data from these surveillance systems produce big maritime data. However, big maritime data is useless without artificial intelligence intervention. This research proposed an intelligent system that provides and analyzes ship path planning, identifies suspicious ships, track ships, and approaches and attacks target ships using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm. Artificial intelligence-based surveillance systems are developed in a single Integrated Coastal Marine Monitoring System, which is expected to perform quickly, precisely, and comprehensively.","archipelagic waters,intelligent coastal surveillance,artificial intelligence-based surveillance systems,unmanned aerial vehicle swarm,ship path planning,CRS,ship tracking,marine radar,ship safety,Safety,target ships,Marine vehicles,relevant state authorities,Sea measurements,Indonesia Coastal Surveillance System,Coastal Radar System,artificial intelligence intervention,coastal radar system,big maritime data,Long Range Camera,illegal activities,object tracking,ships,marine safety,automatic identification system,marine engineering,respective territories,Automatic Identification System,AIS,cameras,high seas,EEZ,maritime domain surveillance,Artificial intelligence,territorial seas,Radar,contiguous zones,illegal firearms smuggling,Big Data,autonomous aerial vehicles,path planning,territorial regimes,long range camera,LRC,suspicious ships,intelligent system,Artificial Intelligence,Surveillance,Navigation,internal waters,video surveillance,artificial intelligence,single integrated coastal marine monitoring system,exclusive economic zones,"

"laser-induced thermal damage detection in metallic materials via acoustic emission and ensemble empirical mode decomposition","2014","A detection method of laser-induced thermal damage–surface burn, rehardening and residual stress, was studied in this work. Artificial thermal damage was produced to various steels, e.g., AISI 1045, ASTM A36 and AISI 304, by virtue of laser irradiation. The aim of the present work is to identify thermal damage through sensor and feature extraction techniques. Acoustic emission(AE) sensor and ensemble empirical mode decomposition(EEMD) method were employed for this purpose. A de-noising method was proposed to eliminate noises from original AE signals, based on EEMD. Quantified thermal damage features were obtained. Results evidenced a strong correlation between AE features, i.e., RMS value of the reconstructed acoustic emission signal, and surface burn, residual stress value, as well as hardness of steels. The present work could be used as a potential and indirect approach for thermal damage detection.","Metallic materials,Ensemble empirical mode decomposition,Laser,Acoustic emission,Thermal damage,"
"traffic knowledge discovery from ais data","2013","Maritime Situational Awareness (i.e., an effective understanding of activities in and impacting the maritime environment) can be significantly improved by knowledge discovery of maritime traffic patterns. The recent build-up of terrestrial networks and satellite constellations of Automatic Identification System (AIS) receivers provides a rich source of cooperative vessel movement information. This vast amount of information can not be fully utilized by human operators and poses new storage and computational challenges. A compact representation of this rapidly increasing amount of information gives operational utility to data which would otherwise be ignored. This paper proposes an unsupervised and incremental learning approach to extract the historical traffic patterns from AIS data. The presented methodology called Traffic Route Extraction for Anomaly Detection (TREAD) effectively processes raw AIS data to infer different levels of contextual information, spanning from the identification of ports and off-shore platforms to spatial and temporal distributions of traffic routes. Furthermore, the accurate understanding of the historical traffic enables the classification and prediction of vessel behaviours as well as the detection of low-likelihood behaviours, or anomalies. The ultimate goal is to provide operators with a configurable knowledge framework supporting day by day decision making and general awareness of vessel pattern of life activity. The methodology is demonstrated via a real-world case study, which can be used as a reference data set for further analysis.","data mining,raw AIS data,traffic route extraction for anomaly detection,Vectors,TREAD,unsupervised learning,operational utility,maritime traffic patterns,unsupervised learning approach,incremental learning approach,low-likelihood behaviours,maritime situational awareness,automatic identification system,Knowledge discovery,marine engineering,Entropy,traffic information systems,configurable knowledge framework,traffic knowledge discovery,Trajectory,Receivers,Surveillance,Data mining,historical traffic patterns,"

Three different incidence angles are considered - 50deg, 60deg and 70deg - corresponding to collection geometries for high altitude maritime surveillance systems. Performance is assessed using a simple target-to-background contrast measure. Results are compared with preliminary results from a four component decomposition of the Mueller matrix.

"discovering maritime traffic route from ais network","2016","The recent build-up network of Automatic Identification System (AIS) equipped on vessels provides a rich source of vessel movement information. AIS is originally designed for automatically exchanging navigation information, such as their unique identification, position, course, and speed, with nearby vessels and terrestrial receivers to affect collision avoidance and safety control. The collected sequences of AIS logs can be considered as maritime trajectory data, i.e., the sequences of location points with timestamps. This vast amount of AIS trajectory data can be collected and employed to achieve an awareness of maritime traffic knowledge. This paper is devoted to discovery of maritime traffic route from trajectory data generated by AIS networks. However, AIS trajectory data discovery is a challenging task because of the trajectory data is available with uncertainty. Furthermore, unlike the vehicles' movements are constrained by road networks, there is no such a sea route for vessels to follow in marine areas. To overcome the challenges, we propose a framework of Maritime Traffic Route Discovery (abbreviated as MTRD) to generate pattern-aware routes to achieve an effective understanding of maritime traffic awareness. The proposed framework is evaluated on real AIS data and the experimental results shows that the proposed MTRD is able to extract the marine traffic route effectively and provides a cornerstone of maritime traffic knowledge for traffic management, anomaly detection, and conflict analysis in the future.","data mining,MTRD,AIS trajectory data discovery,terrestrial receivers,anomaly detection,AIS logs,traffic management,marine navigation,Global Positioning System,vessel movement information,Trajectory pattern mining,Trajectory data,Electronic mail,AIS network,maritime traffic knowledge,automatic identification system,marine safety,location point sequences,maritime trajectory data,Artificial intelligence,safety control,vehicle movements,maritime traffic route discovery,Roads,Trajectory,Uncertainty,traffic engineering computing,AIS trajectory data,AIS System,Maritime Traffic knowledge,automatic navigation information exchange,collision avoidance,conflict analysis,Data mining,maritime traffic awareness,Traffic Route Discovery,"

The interest of nations in who controls the water ways and the resources therein also play a critical role in conflict and high politics amongst nations [1].

"integrating inertial and satellite navigation systems to improve performance for a maritime search and rescue aircraft","2003","Inertial navigation systems (INS) are vital for airplanes, spacecraft, missiles, surface or subsurface vessels operating at sea where continuous, accurate and reliable position information, as well as heading, attitude, acceleration and velocity components of the vehicle are provided. INS have the inherent capability of being autonomous; but however, the errors in position coordinates increase unboundedly as a function of time. On the other hand, satellite navigation systems, as well as advanced radio navigation systems, which are available today and which shall be available in the near future, provide very accurate and frequently updated position information. Unfortunately, these data are prone to jamming or being lost due to the limitations of electromagnetic waves, which form the fundamental of their operation. Also, they are not usable for under-sea or under-Earth applications. To eliminate these deficiencies, INS are integrated with satellite or hyperbolic navigation systems that also obtain intermittent position information. This study gives a mathematical treatise on such an integrated system. As a feasible example, a search and rescue aircraft, involved in an expanding area search operation, equipped with strapdown INS and a Global Positioning System is simulated. The INS use two sets of acceleration and rate of rotation sensors. The model used indicates that the error in position information becomes large in time, otherwise it is limited to acceptably low levels if correction information from Global Positioning System is obtained. Improved performance of the INS by the proposed integration can be utilized to use low-cost sensor elements without the loss of accuracy, thereby making INS a feasible outfit for general purposes.","hyperbolic navigation systems,Remotely operated vehicles,Satellite navigation systems,strapdown inertial navigation system,Airplanes,Kalman filters,Inertial navigation,Aircraft navigation,Acceleration,inertial navigation,Global Positioning System,position coordinate errors,radio navigation systems,search and rescue aircraft,missiles,jamming,subsurface vessels,Space vehicles,marine systems,surface vessels,integration,Sea surface,satellite navigation systems,intermittent position information,autonomous navigation system,rotation sensors,spacecraft,helicopters,aerospace computing,SAR helicopter,Missiles,"
"deep learning to enhance maritime situation awareness","2019","Maritime surveillance sensors like AIS (Automatic Identification System) and Radar provide useful information for decision-making support, which is of paramount importance for effective operations against maritime threats and illegal activities [1]. However, decision-making systems that trust solely on AIS information tend to fail in real situations because such information could be missing, inaccurate or even deceptive [2]. On the other hand, only Radar information is not enough to get a complete description of the maritime situational picture. This paper proposes a deep learning framework for vessel monitoring that examines a particular scenario where a deep learning solution can infer a navigation status based on the vessels trajectories, and thus to detect suspicious vessels activities. For this purpose, a dataset, named DeepMarine, has been specifically created by collecting data of AIS historical recordings.

"5.6 - mass-independent isotopic composition of terrestrial and extraterrestrial materials","2014","Classical isotope effects and measurements have been used for more than 70 years as a tracer of physical and chemical processes. Isotope measurements of stable isotope ratios provide details of a wide range of processes, especially atmospheric. It is now known that the measurement of multi-isotope mass-independent ratios in atmospheric samples has provided insight into sources, transport, and transformation mechanisms of atmospheric species that could not have been otherwise observed. This chapter reviews the basic physical–chemical processes associated with these unusual isotope effects as well as natural sample measurements on Earth (present and past) and Mars. The Earth's earliest atmosphere (billion years) and near past (100000 years to present) can be followed using mass-independent isotopic measurements. Sulfur and oxygen isotopic composition of sulfate and nitrate aerosols in ice cores and sediments helped reveal the stratospheric chemistry and biogeochemical processes. Present-day greenhouse gas fates and budgets, such as carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide, are also presented. Mass-independent isotopic observations of Martian meteorites have provided new information on its atmosphere–regolith interactions.

"a new method for maritime traffic safety index appraisal","2011","In maritime transportation, safety during vessel's navigation at sea depends on technical and human components of the ship-system and the marine environment. The danger to the ship, on board crew and the environment continually change during the entire ship voyage due to numerous unpredictable factors. This paper proposes a new method to assess the maritime traffic safety index of the marine vessel during its journey at sea. The technology recognized as Automatic Identification System (AIS), made a compulsory fitting by the International Maritime Organization (IMO), for ships engaged in international voyages, is used to gather the information needed. This information is then transformed to obtain the various static and dynamic factor values affecting the maritime traffic safety index. Initially, identified factors are grouped under higher level factors to develop a hierarchical structure. Analytic hierarchy process is used to acquire the local weights of the factors at all the levels. Local weights are subsequently converted into normalized global weights for consideration at par. Traffic safety index of the vessel is then estimated using transformed factor values and the normalized global weights. The proposed method could be used in an online assessment of safety index and continual monitoring of variation in it. This would be helpful in the safety management of a marine vessel during its entire navigation.","analytic hierarchy process,international voyage,Safety,Marine vehicles,Monitoring,safety management,hierarchical structure,Sea measurements,ship system,ships,automatic identification system,structural engineering,marine safety,Accidents,maritime transportation,International Maritime Organization,decision making,normalized global weights,Indexes,condition monitoring,Navigation,maritime traffic safely index,marine vessel navigation,traffic,"
"change in silica sources in roman and post-roman glass","2003","Although Roman and post-Empire glasses found in Europe are reputed to have a very constant composition and hence source of components, it appears that some 4–5th century and later specimens show evidence of a different source of silica (sand) component. Zirconium and titanium are the discriminating elements. Data presented here for 278 specimens from 1st to 4th century German and Belgian samples indicate a strongly homogeneous Zr and Ti content; N: number of analyzed samples while 62 samples from Maastricht show low Zr–Ti contents from 1st to 3rd century samples while 4–5th century samples show a strong trend of concomitant Ti and Zr increase. If the high values of Zr–Ti represent a new source of silica (sand) the trend from low to high content suggests that a significant amount of low Zr–Ti glass was recycled to form these glass objects. Similar high Ti content can be seen in analysis results reported for other but not all 4–5th century samples found in northern Europe while earlier productions show typical low Ti contents. Although the fusing agent for these glasses seems to have always been natron (a mineral deposit in the Nile delta) from Hellenistic times to the 9th century, a change in the silica source, indicated by variation of the Ti and Zr content, could very well reflect the results of political instability of the 4–5th century exemplified by the fragmentation of the Roman Empire into two parts.","Silica sources,Roman and post-Roman glass,Glass objects,"

"impact of anthropogenic pb and ocean circulation on the recent distribution of pb isotopes in the indian ocean","2015","Pb and Pb isotope ratios in the modern ocean have been altered significantly by anthropogenic Pb inputs over the past century. Most studies of anthropogenic Pb in the ocean have focused on the North Atlantic and North Pacific Oceans, and the impact of anthropogenic Pb inputs to the Indian Ocean and processes controlling the distribution of Pb in the Indian Ocean are poorly known. This study presents the Pb and Pb isotopic composition (206Pb/207Pb, 208Pb/207Pb) of 11 deep stations from the Indian Ocean Japanese GEOTRACES cruise (KH-09-5), from the Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea to the Southern Ocean (62°S). The Pb isotope ratios of the Indian Ocean range 1.140–1.190 for 206Pb/207Pb and 2.417–2.468 for 208Pb/207Pb, with lower ratios appearing in the shallow waters of the northern Indian Ocean and higher ratios appearing in the deep layers of the Southern Ocean. This result agrees with a previous study on Pb concentrations (Echegoyen et al., 2014) showing that the Indian Ocean, particularly its northern part, is largely perturbed by anthropogenic Pb inputs. 206Pb/207Pb and 208Pb/207Pb of the Indian sector Southern Ocean are still lower than natural Pb, showing this region was also affected by anthropogenic Pb. Anomalously low or high 206Pb/207Pb and 208Pb/207Pb were observed in the thermocline and shallow waters of the southern Indian Ocean and the Arabian Sea, which are ascribed to water mass distribution (e.g., Subantarctic Mode Water) and evolving Pb isotope ratios of this region as dominant anthropogenic Pb sources change. 206Pb/207Pb and 208Pb/207Pb in the Bay of Bengal are higher than those in the Arabian Sea, which might be the result of the anthropogenic Pb inputs from different provenance or seawater exchanging Pb isotopes with natural particles derived from rivers and/or sediments at the basin boundaries.",""
"information fusion and tracking using bernoulli filters for maritime surveillance","2022","This paper concerns the application of information fusion and Bernoulli filtering to a maritime surveillance scenario. Sensor data was recorded during live trials featuring a static Leonardo Osprey maritime surveillance active electronic scan array (AESA) radar observing a cooperative rigid inflatable boat (RIB) target deployed in the Firth of Forth estuary north of Edinburgh, UK. The RIB was equipped with a global positioning system (GPS) and an automatic identification system (AIS) recording geodetic position over time, where the collected data is fused to generate ground truth. A multi-target joint detection and tracking (MTJDT) algorithm is used to both detect and track the RIB target from post-processed radar and AIS data whilst ignoring other information regarding objects and sources of interference. Generalised optimal sub-pattern assignment (GOSPA) and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis are used to evaluate target detection, localisation, and cardinality performance quantification. Results suggest conventional data processing and the proposed tracking algorithm achieve reasonable detection and tracking performance under the assumption that the ground truth well-represents the RIB position without knowledge of error statistics, but track divergence and discontinuities occur due to radar obscuration by buildings, data inaccuracies and clutter.","maritime surveillance scenario,sensor fusion,marine radar,reasonable detection,geodetic position,multitarget joint detection,target detection,Global Positioning System,information fusion,information regarding objects,target tracking,global positioning system,image fusion,sensor data,automatic identification system,data inaccuracies,filtering theory,boats,RIB target,static Leonardo Osprey maritime surveillance active electronic scan array radar,object detection,radar interference,video recording,radar imaging,radar receivers,bernoulli filters,conventional data processing,radar tracking,clutter,radar obscuration,post processed radar,rigid inflatable boat target,video surveillance,track divergence,RIB position,AIS data,"
"uv radiation and skin cancer in norway","2009","A distinct increase in skin cancer incidences is observed since the registration started in Norway in the 1950s. As UV radiation is assumed to be the main risk factor for skin cancer, hourly values of the UV irradiance were reconstructed for the period 1957–2005 for 17 of the Norwegian counties (58–70°N). For reconstruction, a radiation transfer model is run with total ozone amount and cloud information as meteorological input. Reconstructed hourly erythemally weighted UV irradiances for about 5 years are compared to measurements at four stations, two stations representing the north–south extension of Norway, and two stations at about 60°N representing the eastern inland – Western coastal contrasts. The agreement between reconstructed and measured UV varies between 0% for the northernmost site to 10–15% overestimation for the other locations. For clear sky, a reasonable agreement between reconstructed and measured data was found for all stations, while for overcast, an overestimation of 10–20% was found for all but the northernmost station. Both the cancer incidences and the reconstructed UV values have a distinct north–south increase. The UV increase towards south is mostly due to increasing solar elevation. The west to east increase is much smaller, and differences in UV are due to differences in both cloud optical thickness and total cloud amount. One additional outcome from this work is that long-term UV-data are reconstructed for Norway, data that can be used in further biological and medical studies related to UV effects.","STARneuro,UV climatology,Skin cancer,UV radiation,UV reconstruction,"
"a framework for maritime anti-collision pattern discovery from ais network","2019","The avoidance of collisions between ships in encounter situations is crucial to maritime traffic safety. Most research on maritime collision avoidance has focused on planning a safe path by which to avoid approaching ships in accordance with the requirements laid out in the International Regulations for Preventing Collision at Sea (COLREGs). The resulting solution provides reference for the navigator in planning movements to avoid collisions. Nonetheless, specific anti-collision actions are generally based on the experience of the navigator. This study differed from existing works in that we sought to derive collision avoidance behavior from the trajectory data of actual ships. The Automatic Identification System (AIS) network makes it possible to collect an enormous volume of trajectory data and investigate real-world ship behavior. Unfortunately trajectory data that introduces uncertainty can hinder behavior mining for collision avoidance. Irregular and/or asynchronous location sampling can lead to situations in which the movement of a ship does not necessarily follow a given trajectory, even if its movement behavior is similar to that of other ships. In this study, we developed a framework to decipher the anti-collision behavior of ships in encounter situations from a large database of trajectory data collected by AIS network, and to present this behavior in the form of anti-collision patterns. A prototype of the proposed framework was built to enable pattern analysis and visualization functions, thereby providing a deeper understanding of collision avoidance behavior in maritime traffic. The proposed framework is applicable to the development of pattern-aware collision avoidance systems aimed at improving maritime traffic safety.","maritime conflict detection,real-world ship behavior,Safety,Marine vehicles,ship anti-collision pattern,pattern-aware collision avoidance systems,ship trajectory data,behavior mining,AIS network,ships,marine safety,maritime collision avoidance,Collision avoidance,Artificial intelligence,automatic identification system network,Trajectory,collision avoidance behavior,anti-collision behavior,International Regulations for Preventing Collision at Sea,maritime traffic safety,Navigation,collision avoidance,Data mining,maritime anti-collision pattern discovery,"
"climate reconstructions for the last glacial maximum from a simple cirque glacier in fiordland, new zealand","2022","Mountain glacier records offer important constraints on the timing and magnitude of climate variability during the last glacial cycle. Existing moraine chronologies from the central Southern Alps indicate maximum ice extent was achieved during marine isotope stages 3–4, followed by repeated advances of similar, but gradually declining extent during marine isotope stage 2, until onset of the glacial termination. Questions remain over the precise role of climate in driving these changes, as most existing moraine chronologies come from large, complex former valley glacier systems, where non-climatic influences such as changing bed topography and proglacial lake formation may have influenced glacier length changes. Here we address this problem via a new cosmogenic 10Be chronology and equilibrium line altitude reconstruction from a cirque glacier situated in Fiordland, New Zealand. Our chronology shows moraine deposition at 32 ± 11 ka, 18.7 ± 0.2 ka, 18.1 ± 0.1 ka, and c. 17.2 ± 0.3 ka. The simple geometry of the former glacier supports the role of climate in driving a net decline of regional ice volume during marine isotope stages 3–2.

Onset of warming after 17.2 ± 0.2 ka is consistent with climate proxy evidence for a sustained southward shift in the southern westerly winds, which may have promoted deglaciation via shifting ocean currents and promoting increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide.","Glaciation,Pleistocene,Quaternary,Geomorphology,Southern pacific,Degree day modelling,Cosmogenic isotopes,Equilibrium line altitude,Paleoclimatology,Glacial,"
"fusion of over-the-horizon radar and automatic identification systems for overall maritime picture","2007","Over-the-horizon (OTH) radar and automatic identification system (AIS) are commonly used in the surveillance of maritime areas. This paper presents a method, which includes tracking and association algorithms, for fusing the information from these two types of systems into an overall maritime picture. Data to be fused consists of asynchronous track estimates from the OTH system and measurements obtained from AIS. The data available at the fusion center, as output of real world systems, contained incomplete information, compared to theoretical tracking and fusion algorithms. A method to estimate the missing information in the input data is described. Results obtained using real data as well as simulated data are presented.

"optimized time-shifted pilots for maritime massive mimo communication systems","2017","With the growing demand for mobile multimedia services in marine activities, maritime communication systems are impelled to provide higher data rates with limited radio resources. Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) is thus recognized as a promising technology in this case. However, pilot contamination leads to strong inter-cell interference and greatly degrades system performance. In this paper, we focus on the joint position-power optimization of time-shifted pilots in a maritime massive MIMO system. Based on large-scale channel fading information, we first propose an efficient user scheduling algorithm, and then optimize the pilot power under the average power constraint. Further, we optimize the positions and power of the pilots iteratively.

"beidou-based passive multistatic radar maritime moving target detection technique via spaceâ€“time hybrid integration processing","2022","This article puts forward a BeiDou-based passive multistatic radar (PMR) maritime moving target (MMT) detection technique via spaceâ€“time hybrid integration (STHI) processing. Compared with passive bistatic radar (PBR), the utilization of multiple satellites provides an improvement in MMT detection performance, together with the capabilities of localization and velocity estimation. However, the multiple satellite transmitters cause the differences principally in bistatic range and Doppler centroid (DC) of the MMT. To integrate the PMR echoes, the biggest challenge is the two differences that need to be handled. In the proposed technique, first, the centroid-compensated keystone transform (CCKT) is proposed and applied to each PBR echo. It not only corrects range cell migration (RCM) but also equalizes the DC to the same. Then, the long-time integration is performed on each PBR echo, after which it is integrated into the range-Doppler frequency rate (DFR) domain. Finally, in order to settle the difference in bistatic range, an MMT position and velocity domain (i.e., the  $X$ â€“ $Y$ â€“ $V$  domain) is constituted. The obtained multiple range-DFR maps are projected to the  $X$ â€“ $Y$ â€“ $V$  domain, and then, the effective integration of multistatic echoes can be implemented. The final STHI result allows detecting the MMT reliably. Meanwhile, according to the 3-D position where the MMT is located in the  $X$ â€“ $Y$ â€“ $V$  domain, the MMT can be localized, and its velocity can be estimated simultaneously. In May 2021, we have successfully carried out the worldâ€™s first BeiDou-based PMR MMT detection experiment, and the experimental results are given to prove the effectiveness of this technique.","Satellites,MMT position,range cell migration,marine radar,MMT detection performance,radar detection,passive radar,PBR echo,RCM,transforms,passive bistatic radar,Radio transmitters,STHI processing,BeiDou-based PMR MMT detection technique,space-time hybrid integration processing,satellite navigation,centroid-compensated keystone transform,maritime surveillance,maritime moving target (MMT) detection,object detection,BeiDou-based passive radar,spaceâ€“time hybrid integration (STHI),PMR echoes,bistatic range,Doppler effect,multistatic echoes,Doppler centroid,Satellite broadcasting,range-Doppler frequency rate domain,multiple satellite transmitters,Doppler radar,Passive radar,BeiDou-based passive multistatic radar maritime moving target detection technique,Receivers,spaceborne radar,CCKT,Multistatic radar,passive multistatic radar (PMR),radar cross-sections,range-DFR domain,multiple range-DFR maps,"
"electromagnetic modeling of ships in maritime scenarios: geometrical optics approximation","2018","Global Navigation Satellite System-Reflectometry (GNSS-R), is succesfully employed for ocean altimetric and scatterometric applications. Recently, it has been suggested that GNSS-R can also be used for ship detection applications. To this purpose, an accurate electromagnetic modeling of the bistatic radar cross section of a ship lying over the sea surface would be very helpful. However, existing models are typically limited to monostatic configurations, thus restricting their applicability in multistatic scenarios, such as GNSS-R systems.

"moving ship optimal association for maritime surveillance: fusing ais and sentinel-2 data","2022","Nowadays, a variety of different sources can be combined together to measure and monitor maritime human activities. Reliable data fusion techniques are essential to associate the targets from different systems for maritime surveillance. In particular, the fusion of data from Sentinel-2 satellites and the automatic identification system (AIS) has attracted wide attention due to their public availability and complementarity. However, most traditional methods for target association are not suitable for this particular case, due to the time lag phenomenon of Sentinel-2 data. In this study, we first construct two new datasets for the detection of moving ships and their wakes based on Sentinel-2 images. Combined with the detection results obtained by the you only look once (YOLOv5) model, the position and course information of the detected ships are first extracted. After carefully analyzing the time lag phenomenon of Sentinel-2 data, we develop a new domain adaptation-based method for target association based on the fusion of Sentinel-2 and AIS data, called moving ship optimal association (MSOA). Different from standard domain adaptation methods only for representation alignment, the proposed MSOA is able to align representation, time, and position simultaneously. A case study is provided in which the newly proposed method is tested over the Port of Long Beach, USA. Experimental results demonstrate that both moving ships and wakes are well detected. Specifically, our newly proposed MSOA exhibits more accurate and robust performance when compared to traditional methods, and the detected ships without corresponding AIS tracks can also be detected by our MSOA. Moreover, the real sensing time and time lag of Sentinel-2 data are deduced with high accuracy. Overall, it can be concluded that our MSOA provides a new perspective for accurate target association based on heterogeneous data fusion.","surveillance,Remote sensing,sensor fusion,remote sensing,MSOA,time lag,ship detection,detected ships,heterogeneous data fusion,Marine vehicles,domain adaptation,ship optimal association,Data fusion,accurate target association,geophysical image processing,Sentinel-2 images,target tracking,Optical sensors,ships,time lag phenomenon,maritime surveillance,Target tracking,target association,you only look once (YOLO),Artificial intelligence,radar tracking,moving ships,Sentinel-2 satellites,Sensors,Surveillance,maritime surveillance (MS),domain adaptation-based method,reliable data fusion techniques,AIS data,Sentinel-2 data,"
"optimal auv trajectory planning and execution control for maritime pollution incident response","2021","Marine pollution incidents can have a huge impact on different ecosystems, with unpredictable short- and long-term consequences. Once the pollutant is detected, it is critical to quickly understand its characteristics so that authorities can lay out an adequate response. In parallel to the time- and cost-constrained traditional operational means, this paper suggests the use of AUVs for the sampling procedures of marine pollution incidents, to increase the speed and efficiency of operations. A new software architecture is developed, integrating trajectory optimization for AUVs into a software toolchain that allows human operators to plan, simulate, and control multiple vehicles deployments.

"comparison of target detectors to identify icebergs in quad- polarimetric sar alos-2 images","2021","Icebergs represent hazards to ships and maritime activities and therefore their detection is essential. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellites are very useful for this, due to their capability to acquire under cloud cover and during polar nights. Additionally, polarimetry has been proven to improve the detection capability. In this work, we compare six state-of-the-art quad polarimetric detectors to test their performance and ability to detect small sized icebergs in four locations in Greenland. These were the polarimetric notch filter (PNF), polarimetric match filter (PMF), polarimetric whitening filter (PWF), optimal polarimetric detector (OPD), reflection symmetry detector, and the dual polarisation anomaly detector (iDPolRAD). We use four single look complex ALOS-2 quad pol images. The data were calibrated and processed.

"power allocation for maritime cognitive satellite-uav-terrestrial networks","2020","In this paper, we investigate hybrid satellite-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-terrestrial networks for maritime coverage enhancement. We adopt tethered UAVs to provide aerial base station (BS) sites, and orchestrate onshore and UAV-mounted BSs in a user-centric manner. To address the spectrum scarcity problem, all available spectrum is shared among satellites, UAVs and terrestrial base stations (TBSs). This generates undesirable challenging co-channel interference (CCI) under the irregular cell-free system topology. We establish a cognitive framework to sense not only the spectrum status but also ships' position information. According to the cognitive information, user-centric virtual clusters are self organized by a group of UAVs and onshore BSs. Besides, location-dependent large-scale channel state information (CSI) can be obtained through the cognitive position information. We thus optimize the power allocation strategy with only the large-scale CSI, to further mitigate both the inter-cluster interference and leakage interference to satellite users. The problem is non-convex. By using the random matrix theory and successive convex optimization methods, we solve it in an iterative way.

"low-latitude ordovician to triassic brachiopod habitat temperatures (bhts) determined from δ18o[brachiopod calcite]: a cold hard look at ice-house tropical oceans","2012","Some researchers have suggested that Phanerozoic land-based ice sheets extended occasionally into the tropical realm. If true, the tropical ocean at those times must have been distinctly colder than at the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) when northern hemisphere ice sheets did not extend below 38° latitude. Low-latitude ocean temperatures derived from oxygen isotopes of brachiopod shells test this hypothesis by comparing the temperature regime for Paleozoic and early Mesozoic low-latitude settings to the tropical temperature regime of the modern interstadial ocean, and to mean temperatures estimated for the tropical ocean at LGM. A running mean of pH-adjusted brachiopod habitat temperatures (BHTs) shows that Paleozoic low-latitude oceans were, on average, cool to cold relative to the modern interstadial tropical ocean. At times during Pennsylvanian, Serpukhovian, Tournaisian and Ordovician–Silurian glaciations, these tropical seas were indeed significantly colder on average than at the LGM. Ice-sheets within tropical latitudes can be reasonably predicted at those times. Abundant and diverse Paleozoic brachiopod communities reflect these cool tropical oceans, consistent with modern brachiopod ecological preference for colder waters. Amplified Paleozoic temperature oscillations suggest recurring global warming events which episodically drove these cold tropical oceans to temperatures significantly higher than the warmest modern tropical ocean.","Glaciation,Cool tropics,Brachiopod habitat,Oxygen isotopes,Temperature,"
"maritime coverage enhancement using uavs coordinated with hybrid satellite-terrestrial networks","2020","Due to the agile maneuverability, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have shown great promise for on-demand communications. In practice, UAV-aided aerial base stations are not separate. Instead, they rely on existing satellites/terrestrial systems for spectrum sharing and efficient backhaul. In this case, how to coordinate satellites, UAVs and terrestrial systems is still an open issue. In this paper, we deploy UAVs for coverage enhancement of a hybrid satellite-terrestrial maritime communication network. Using a typical composite channel model including both large-scale and small-scale fading, the UAV trajectory and in-flight transmit power are jointly optimized, subject to constraints on UAV kinematics, tolerable interference, backhaul, and the total energy of the UAV for communications. Different from existing studies, only the location-dependent large-scale channel state information (CSI) is assumed available, because it is difficult to obtain the small-scale CSI before takeoff in practice and the ship positions can be obtained via the dedicated maritime Automatic Identification System. The optimization problem is non-convex. We solve it by using problem decomposition, successive convex optimization and bisection searching tools.

"path orthogonal matching pursuit for sparse reconstruction and denoising of swir maritime imagery","2018","We introduce an extension that may be used to augment algorithms used for the sparse decomposition of signals into a linear combination of atoms drawn from a dictionary such as those used in support of, for example, compressive sensing, k-sparse representation, and denoising. Our augmentation may be applied to any reconstruction algorithm that relies on the selection and sorting of high-correlation atoms during an analysis or identification phase by generating a 'path' between the two highest-correlation atoms. Here we investigate two types of path: a linear combination (Euclidean geodesic) and a construction relying on an optimal transport map (2-Wasserstein geodesic). We test our extension by performing image denoising and k-sparse representation using atoms from a learned overcomplete kSVD dictionary. We study the application of our techniques on SWIR imagery of maritime vessels and show that our methods outperform orthogonal matching pursuit. We conclude that these methods, having shown success in our two tested problem domains, will also be useful for reducing 'basis mismatch' error that arises in the recovery of compressively sampled images.","image denoising,Matching pursuit algorithms,path orthogonal matching pursuit,highest-correlation atoms,Image reconstruction,compressively sampled images,SWIR maritime imagery,high-correlation atoms,Euclidean geodesic,Dictionaries,image matching,image representation,linear combination,SWIR imagery,2-Wasserstein geodesic,orthogonal matching pursuit,Standards,Noise reduction,compressed sensing,optimal transport map,image reconstruction,Correlation,learned overcomplete kSVD dictionary,compressive sensing,k-sparse representation,reconstruction algorithm,sparse reconstruction,Imaging,learning (artificial intelligence),identification phase,"
"“contextual areas” of early homo sapiens and their significance for human dispersal from africa into eurasia between 200 ka and 70 ka","2012","The African origin of our species has essentially been accepted as a scientific fact, but evolutionary advantages connected with the reasons and circumstances of modern human dispersal remain widely unexplained or controversial. Consequently, this paper provides an overview of the natural and cultural context of earliest AMH (Anatomically Modern Humans). According to the locations and dating of AMH fossils, the focus is on E-Africa, NE-Africa and the Middle East within a time range from 200 ka to 70 ka. At least three different “contextual areas” appear to have existed at the time, two of them in E-Africa and NE-Africa, dominated by “Bifacial-plus-Levallois” technology, and the third one in the Middle East, mostly connected with an “only-Levallois” technology. A comparison with some non-AMH sites from Eurasia displays similarity of technological principles between artifact assemblages from African AMH sites and Eurasian non-AMH (early Neanderthal) sites on the one hand, and dissimilarity between African AMH sites and Middle Eastern AMH sites on the other hand. This is particularly surprising if environmental contexts are taken into account – tropical in Africa and glacial in Eurasia. Thus, compared to their archaic neighbors (particularly early Neanderthals), earliest modern humans currently seem to lack any specific “cultural fingerprint” and their demographic success may not be explained by behavioral superiority alone. The idea of a small group of early AMH people migrating out of Africa, enabled by cultural superiority over their neighbors appears highly questionable in the light of archaeological evidence. Moreover, the concept of virtual “migration routes” deserves a revision if ethnodemographic evidence about spatial behavior of hunter-gatherers is taken into account. The proposed concept of “contextual areas” serves as a methodological alternative, comprising linked cultural and environmental features.","Neanderthals,migration routes,Africa,Modern Human Behavioral Package (MHBP),Middle East,Anatomically Modern Humans (AMH),"
"enhancing the reliability of shipborne ins/gnss integrated navigation system during abnormal sampling periods using bi-lstm and robust ckf","2023","Developing a reliable navigation system is a crucial challenge for intelligent ships. Integrating Inertial Navigation Systems (INS) with shipborne Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) provides a viable solution. However, the system's reliability heavily relies on GNSS availability. This paper proposes a method to enhance the reliability of shipborne INS/GNSS integrated navigation systems during GNSS abnormal sampling periods. The proposed method consists of two parts. Firstly, using specially designed input and output parameters, a pseudo-GNSS prediction model based on a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network (Bi-LSTM) is constructed to generate predicted pseudo-GNSS measurements during periods of GNSS loss, effectively filling in the gaps left by the absence of actual GNSS data. Secondly, Huber's M-estimation-based Robust Cubature Kalman filter (RCKF) is integrated into the data fusion algorithm, and a switching mechanism between RCKF and the Cubature Kalman filter (CKF) is established based on the source of GNSS data utilized for measurement update, to mitigate the impact of non-Gaussian distribution prediction noise introduced by pseudo-GNSS prediction model. Experimental validation using real ship navigation data in a natural marine environment confirms the proposed method's capability to maintain navigation accuracy during GNSS loss for shipborne INS/GNSS integrated navigation systems. The algorithm's superiority becomes more evident as the duration of GNSS loss increases, underscoring its effectiveness in enhancing shipborne integrated navigation system reliability.","Bi-LSTM,Intelligent ship,GNSS loss,Robust CKF,Navigation reliability,Ship integrated navigation,"
"variational bayesian-based robust adaptive filtering for gnss/ins tightly coupled positioning in urban environments","2023","Kalman filter (KF) is an efficient approach for state estimation in integrated positioning systems of global navigation satellite systems and inertial navigation systems (GNSS/INS). Unfortunately, GNSS/INS integrated positioning systems are susceptible to state model perturbations and measurement outliers, which can severely degrade KF performance, especially in complex urban environments. To solve this problem, a robust adaptive filtering algorithm based on variational Bayesian (VBRAKF) is presented that can be employed in GNSS/INS tightly coupled positioning systems. In VBRAKF, the robust estimation approach is first introduced into the filter, followed by modeling the predicted covariance matrix using the inverse Wishart distribution, and finally the state is estimated using Variational Bayesian. The robustness is achieved by adjusting the noise by an equivalent weight matrix to reduce gross errors in observations, while the adaptiveness is realized by the variational Bayesian estimation method for the uncertain predicted noise covariance matrix. The positioning performance of the proposed algorithm in urban environments is verified through two sets of land vehicle experiments. The experimental results demonstrate that the 3D positioning accuracy of the VBRAKF algorithm is improved by 32.1% and 23.5% in experiment 1 and by 37.1% and 17.3% in experiment 2 when compared to KF and Robust Kalman Filter (RKF). The proposed VBRAKF algorithm has better positioning performance in all schemes, can simultaneously control the influence of measurement outliers and inaccurate noise statistics and improves the accuracy of filter estimation.","Tightly coupled positioning,Robust estimation,GNSS/INS,Adaptive filtering,Variational Bayesian,"
"infrared maritime target detection based on iterative corner and edge weights in tensor decomposition","2023","High-precision infrared maritime target detection plays an important role in early warning, monitoring, search, and rescue. The methods of decomposing the original image into low-rank background components and sparse target components show favorable detection performance. However, the strong edge interference is also sparse and may be mistakenly taken as target components, resulting in a large number of false alarms and reducing detection accuracy. To solve the problem, we propose an iterative corner and edge weights method based on tensor decomposition. The original image is decomposed into the background component, target component, and additional strong edge interference component. The corner strength is designed as the weight of the target component, and the edge strength is designed as the weight of the interference component in order to separate the target and interference more accurately. And the two weights are designed to be updated during each iteration of the model solution to reduce the impact of initial imprecise weights on detection results. Compared with 8 advanced baseline methods in 10 datasets, the proposed method demonstrates outstanding results and shows engineering application prospects.","Image edge detection,maritime target detection,iterative corner,edge weights method,background component,edge strength,Solid modeling,edge detection,tensors,interference suppression,detection accuracy reduction,target component,initial imprecise weights,corner strength,false alarms,object detection,Infrared small target detection,low-rank background components,tensor decomposition,iterative weight,sparse target components,Tensors,Iterative methods,Object detection,Interference,favorable detection performance,strong edge interference component,Analytical models,"

"late holocene palaeoclimatic records from lake sediments on james ross island, antarctica","1996","Sediment profiles from several lakes/ponds in the northern, ice-free area of James Ross Island, Antarctica, were the subject of a multi-disciplinary palaeoenvironmental investigation. The results, obtained from lithological, geomagnetic, geochemical and diatom analyses, and the frequency of Branchinecta eggs, were evaluated with multivariate statistics and provide a fairly detailed picture of climate change during the last 5000 years. New radiocarbon dates are combined with previously published 14C dates, so as to date the palaeoenvironmental and palaeohydrological changes identified by the stratigraphic studies. In combination with the findings of glacial geological studies our data suggest that the Brandy Bay glacier began to recede rapidly just before 5000 yr B.P., due to calving and moisture starvation caused by cold and arid conditions. In one of the ponds studied gypsum began to precipitate as a consequence of these conditions when the influence of glacial meltwater ceased. This hypothesis was tested by hydrochemical modeling. At approximately 4200 yr B.P. the climate became more humid (and warmer) and the pond supported a fairly diverse biota, which included a variety of diatom species and, for example, Branchinecta gaini, a crustacean that feeds on benthic cyanobacterial mats. The Brandy Bay glacier probably advanced during this humid period, but the advance was interrupted by subsequent arid conditions which started at 3000 yr B.P. During this arid phase, glaciers became completely absent from the study area. As a result formerly large lakes, fed by glacial meltwater, transformed into small, enclosed, brackish water bodies that contained B. gaini. The arid and fairly cold conditions lasted for 1500–2000 years, until approximately 1200 yr B.P. when the aquatic systems expanded and their salinity was lowered as a result of increased snow accumulation and glacial expansion. The increased deposition of minerogenic matter caused by glacial erosion and meltwater inflow probably caused the disappearance of Branchinecta on James Ross Island. We regard this most recent phase as a period of increased humidity and warmth compared to the previous period, although the conditions appear to be less warm and humid than those which prevailed during the climatic optimum between 4200 and 3000 yr B.P. In spite of certain correlation problems we tentatively correlate our results to other studies of Holocene environments in Antarctica, and from that it can be suggested that the climatic optimum was of circumpolar significance. Therefore the climatic oscillations recorded in sediments on James Ross Island may reflect oscillations in the anticyclonic stormtracks and the strength of the high pressure cell over the inland ice sheet.",""

"inferences on gas transport based on molecular and isotopic signatures of gases at acoustic chimneys and background sites in the ulleung basin","2012","We present results of a comparative study of hydrocarbons collected at acoustic chimney sites and nearby non-chimney (background) sites in the Ulleung Basin (offshore Korea). At all sites, molecular (C1/C2+ ratios⩾600) and isotopic (δ13CCH4, δDCH4 and δ13CC2H6) indicators point to a microbial source of methane and ethane. Similarly, at all sites the δ13CCH4 and δ13CCO2 have minimum values at the sulfate–methane transition zone (SMTZ) throughout the basin. These data document intense carbon cycling at this horizon, whereby anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) at the SMTZ generates a dissolved inorganic carbon pool depleted in 13C that is subsequently reduced to generate the observed minima in δ13CCH4. At the background sites, the carbon isotope fractionation factor (εc=δ13CCO2−δ13CCH4) for all gases ranges from 56–66, consistent with values predicted for methanogenesis driven predominantly by microbial CO2 reduction. However, εc values measured in the two acoustic chimney sites that contain gas hydrate are significantly lower (30–46). We conclude that these abnormally small εc values reflect two phase fluid transport at gas hydrate bearing sites. The composition of the hydrocarbons sampled below the SMTZ at these sites (higher C2+ abundance and δ13C enriched methane) indicates a deep source origin for the microbial gas, which we postulate migrates upwardly and sustains the gas hydrate formation near the seafloor. If so, abnormally small εc values can be used as a potential geochemical indicator for the migration of methane in the gas phase and the consequent development of gas hydrate accumulations in shallow marine systems.",""
"a design framework for a system of digital twins and services","2023","Digital twins represent physical systems in virtual space to enable knowledge intensive tasks. For complex physical systems, effective digital integration can often be achieved by means of a system of aggregated digital twins coupled with a services network. Designing such a system of digital twins and services involves a daunting array of options and considerations. This paper presents a design framework that facilitates systematic, effective decisions when designing a system of digital twins to integrate the data from a complex physical system. The design framework is arranged in six steps: 1) needs and constraints analysis, 2) physical system decomposition, 3) services allocation, 4) performance and quality considerations, 5) implementation considerations and 6) verification and validation. The design framework works with a general reference architecture that combines a digital twin aggregation hierarchy with a service-oriented architecture. This reference architecture allows for the separation of concerns, computational load distribution, incremental development and modular software design. The paper considers the merits of the design framework using two illustrative case studies, i.e. a heliostat field and a smart city. The case studies indicate that the design framework can be applied to a wide range of complex systems and can improve the effectiveness of the design process.","Design framework,Aggregation,Service-oriented architecture,Complex system,Digital twin,"
"novel climates: trajectories of climate change beyond the boundaries of british columbia’s forest management knowledge system","2018","The non-stationary climates of the 21st century are compelling forest managers to seek non-local species, provenances, and silvicultural regimes that are better suited to the anticipated future climates of their operating areas. Ideally, forest managers can source this information from climate analogs within their jurisdictions, but the emergence of unfamiliar climates is a distinct possibility with particular challenges. Here, we present an assessment of the emergence of mid-21st-century climates with no analog in the 20th-century climates of British Columbia (BC), and the extent to which these novel climates are described by climate analogs elsewhere in North America. We use a recently developed linear method of novel climate detection in parallel with Random Forest classification to evaluate the robustness of novel climate inferences. Our results suggest that a majority of the province’s area will remain free of novel climates over this time period, and therefore that BC’s ecological knowledge system, the Biogeoclimatic Ecosystem Classification, can remain the dominant source of climate analogs for mid-21st-century forest management planning horizons. Nevertheless, we detected a robust pattern of climates that are novel to BC in mid-21st-century climate projections at low elevations in the coastal, southern interior, and northeastern regions of the province. There appears to be potential to inform forest management in some of these novel climates with analogs from adjacent states and provinces. We demonstrate that extrapolations into novel climates typically understate the magnitude of climate change and modeling uncertainty, creating a false impression of robust predictions in locations where model performance is poorest. By identifying portions of their landscapes that are prone to emergence of novel climates, forest managers can avoid management errors and prioritize the search for analogs beyond the boundaries of their knowledge systems.","Mahalanobis distance,Bioclimate,No-analog,Novel climates,Random Forest,Biogeoclimatic ecosystem classification,"
"the status of coastal oceanography in heavily impacted yellow and east china sea: past trends, progress, and possible futures","2015","Coastal environments are a key location for transport, commercial, residential and defence infrastructure, and have provided conditions suitable for economic growth. They also fulfil important cultural, recreational and aesthetic needs; have intrinsic ecosystem service values; and provide essential biogeochemical functions such as primary productivity, nutrient cycling and water filtration. The rapid expansion in economic development and anticipated growth of the population in the coastal zones along the Yellow and East China Sea basin has placed this region under intense multiple stresses. Here we aim to: 1) synthesize the new knowledge/science in coastal oceanography since 2010 within the context of the scientific literature published in English; 2) report on a citation analysis that assesses whether new research topics have emerged and integrated over time, indicate the location of modelling and field-based studies; and 3) suggest where the new research should develop for heavily impacted estuaries and coastal seas of East Asia. The conclusions of the synthesis include: 1) China has emerged as a dominant force in the region in producing scientific literature in coastal oceanography, although the area of publications has shifted from its traditional fields such as physical oceanography; 2) there has been an increasing number of publications with cross-disciplinary themes between physical oceanography and other fields of the biological, chemical, and geological disciplines, but vigorous and systematic funding mechanisms are still lacking to ensure the viability of large scale multi-disciplinary teams and projects in order to support trans-disciplinary research and newly emerging fields; 3) coastal oceanography is responding to new challenges, with many papers studying the impacts of human activities on marine environment and ecology, but so far very few studying management and conservation strategies or offering policy solutions.","Yellow Sea and East China Sea,Japan,conservation,Taiwan,Korea,physical and biogeochemical processes,management,coastal oceanography,China,"

Each UAV is able to measure bearing to the beacon but not its range. Novel guidance and control strategies based on cost function gradient search techniques are developed to achieve a continuous reduction in the estimate of the beacon location. Simulation studies reveal the localisation and circling behaviour achieved with the various cost functions, and a new minimum estimation error configuration is discovered.

"the significance of spectral position in the rhodopsins of tropical marine fishes","1973","Visual pigments were extracted from the retinae of a large and diverse sample (179 species, in 40 families) of tropical marinefishes. By the method of partial bleaching, most of these were found to be retinal-1 pigments, with their maxima tightly grouped between 489 and 502 nm; but a few have λmax at shorter wavelengths. The spectral position of these pigments does not correlate with diurnal or nocturnal activity patterns, nor do closely related species necessarily have similar pigments. In general, the deeper-living species have rhodopsins with λmax at shorter wavelengths, a correlation with the bluer quality of light in deeper water. The spectral distribution of light was measured in air and underwater at a coral atoll. During twilight the underwater spectrum narrows and shifts to shorter wavelengths, as a result of increased absorption of yellow-orange light by the atmosphere. This effect at twilight is unique among the general spectral events that constitute each day. The behavioral patterns of reef fishes make clear the relationships between underwater light and the visual pigments. During evening twilight, there is an orderly sequence, in which the diurnal fishes seek cover, and then, after a “Quiet Period”, the nocturnal species emerge. The “Quiet Period” is the most critical and visually difficult time because light intensities are transitional between the thresholds of photopic and scotopic vision. Predation reaches a maximum during the “Quiet Period”. The rhodopsins of all these fishes tend to match the background light available during evening and morning twilight. Photochemically, visual sensitivity is maximized and, as a result, predation is held in check. The relationships between light, behavior and visual physiology are discussed. Although their rhodopsins are spectrally similar to those of the prey, crepuscular predators obtain a visual advantage by having moderate numbers of very large cones, which provide adequate sensitivity and sufficient resolution for motion detection.

"striking similarities in temporal changes to spring sea ice occurrence across the central canadian arctic archipelago over the last 7000 years","2010","A 7000 year spring sea ice record for Victoria Strait (ARC-4) and Dease Strait (ARC-5) in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago (CAA) has been determined by quantification of the sea ice diatom-derived biomarker IP25 in two marine sediment piston cores obtained in 2005. The chronologies of the ARC-4 and ARC-5 cores were determined using a combination of 14C AMS dates obtained from macrobenthic fossils and magnetic susceptibility measurements. The ages of the tops of the piston cores were estimated by matching chemical and physical parameters with those obtained from corresponding box cores. These analyses revealed that, while the top of the ARC-4 piston core was estimated to be essentially modern (ca. 60 cal yr BP), a few hundred years of sediment appeared to be absent from the ARC-5 piston core. Downcore changes to IP25 fluxes for both cores were interpreted in terms of variations in spring sea ice occurrence, and correlations between the individual IP25 flux profiles for Victoria Strait, Dease Strait and Barrow Strait (reported previously) were shown to be statistically significant at both 50 and 100-year resolutions. The IP25 data indicate lower spring sea ice occurrences during the early part of the record (ca. 7.0–3.0 cal kyr BP) and for parts of the late Holocene (ca. 1.5–0.8 cal kyr BP), especially for the two lower latitude study locations. In contrast, higher spring sea ice occurrences existed during ca. 3.0–1.5 cal kyr BP and after ca. 800 cal yr BP. The observation of, consecutively, lower and higher spring sea ice occurrence during two periods of the late Holocene, coincides broadly with the Medieval Warm Period and Little Ice Age epochs, respectively. The IP25 data are complemented by particle size and mineralogical data, although these may alternatively reflect changes in sea level at the study sites. The IP25 data are also compared to previous proxy-based determinations of palaeo sea ice and palaeoclimate for the CAA, including those based on bowhead whale remains and dinocyst assemblages. The spatial consistency in the proxy data which, most notably, indicates an increase in spring sea ice occurrence around 3 cal kyr BP, provides a potentially useful benchmark for the termination of the Holocene Thermal Maximum for the central CAA.",""

Depending on the datasets used for testing, the detection algorithms offer different advantages and disadvantages. The systematic method used in discriminating real detected targets and false alarms in order to determine the detection rate, allows us to perform an appropriate and consistent comparison of the detectors.

"predictive control of container flows in maritime intermodal terminals","2013","Predictive control is investigated as a paradigm for the allocation of handling resources to transfer containers inside intermodal terminals. The decisions on the allocation of such resources are derived from the minimization of performance cost functions that measure the lay times of carriers over a forward horizon basing on a model of the container flows. Such a model allows one to take advantage of the information available in real time on the arrival or departure of carriers with the corresponding amounts of containers scheduled for loading or unloading. The resulting strategy of resource allocation can be regarded as a feedback control law and is obtained by solving nonlinear programming problems online. Since the computation may be too expensive, a technique based on the idea of approximating offline such a law is proposed. The approximation is performed by using neural networks, which allow one to construct an approximate feedback controller and generate the corresponding online control actions with a negligible computational burden. The effectiveness of the approach is shown via simulations in a case study.","feedback,container flows,resource allocation handling,Mathematical model,neural networks,Resource management,transfer containers,online control actions,neurocontrollers,Least squares approximation,forward horizon,Loading,predictive control,feedback control law,Containers,containers,nonlinear programming,freight handling,Container terminal management,maritime intermodal terminals,feedback controller,Predictive control,resource allocation,performance cost functions,"
"joint optimization of trajectory and communication resource allocation for unmanned surface vehicle enabled maritime wireless networks","2021","In maritime wireless communications, unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) can improve coverage and transmission performance due to their agile maneuverability and flexible deployment. This paper considers a USV-enabled maritime wireless network, where a USV is employed to assist the communication between the terrestrial base station and ships. Considering the maritime environment characteristics and earth curvature, we establish the systematic USV kinetics and information transmission models. To guarantee fairness, we aim to maximize the minimum expected throughput overall ships by jointly optimizing the trajectory and communication resource allocation, subject to the constraints of the USV kinetics, safe sailing, breakpoint distances, line-of-sight links, resource allocation, and information-causality. Due to the complexity of the maritime two-ray signal propagation model, we propose a channel approximation method to find an upper bound of the throughput for the original problem.

"the magnetostratigraphy of coniacian-late campanian chalk sequences in southern england","1998","Magnetostratigraphic data are reported from the Coniacian to early Late Campanian chalk sequences at Culver Cliff and Scratchell's Bay on the Isle of Wight and Seaford Head in East Sussex, UK. Mean natural remanent magnetisation (NRM) intensity values for individual sample sites range from 0.0013 to 1.6008 mA/m, with an overall mean of 0.0165 mA/m. Reliable determination of the remanence of the very weakly magnetic units was achieved by carrying out replicate palaeomagnetic measurements on large volume samples, using a 2-G ‘wholecore’ cryogenic magnetometer. Palaeomagnetic measurements on other, standard-sized samples were made with a CCL ‘discrete sample’ cryogenic magnetometer. Incremental thermal and AF demagnetisation treatment was used to remove magnetic overprints and to isolate the characteristic remanent magnetisation (ChRM). A reliability classification scheme has been developed and applied in this study, to provide an objective assessment of the quality of the palaeomagnetic results. IRM acquisition experiments suggest that the dominant magnetic mineral in these sediments is magnetite, but mixtures of hematite and magnetite occur also. SEM and TEM studies of magnetic mineral extracts indicate the presence of magnetite and hematite, preserved as inclusions within silicate grains, together with abundant bacterial magnetite preserved as individual grains and chains in some samples. Samples containing the greatest proportions of bacterial magnetite generally have the highest NRM intensity. The composite magnetic polarity sequence, derived by combining the data from all three sections, is characterised by three principal magnetic polarity zones which can be correlated with geomagnetic Chrons C34n, C33r and C33n, respectively. The positions of the chron boundaries have been tied to macrofossil and nannofossil biostratigraphic zones in these sections. A series of previously undocumented short magnetic polarity sub-chrons has been identified within the longer magnetochrons. These have potential value for high-resolution stratigraphic correlations and significance for theories of geodynamo behaviour.","paleomagnetism,England,chalk,Campanian,Coniacian,magnetostratigraphy,"
"data-driven trajectory quality improvement for promoting intelligent vessel traffic services in 6g-enabled maritime iot systems","2021","Future generation communication systems, such as 5G and 6G wireless systems, exploit the combined satellite-terrestrial communication infrastructures to extend network coverage and data throughput for data-driven applications. These ground-breaking techniques have promoted the rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT) in maritime industries. In maritime IoT applications, intelligent vessel traffic services can be guaranteed by collecting and analyzing high volume of spatial data flows from automatic identification system (AIS). This AIS system includes a highly integrated automatic equipment, including functionalities of core communication, tracking, and sensing. The increased utilization of shipboard AIS devices allows the collection of massive trajectory data. However, the received raw AIS data often suffers from undesirable outliers (i.e., poorly tracked timestamped points for vessel trajectories) during signal acquisition and analog-to-digital conversion. The degraded AIS data will bring negative effects on vessel traffic services (e.g., maritime traffic monitoring, intelligent maritime navigation, vessel collision avoidance, etc.) in maritime IoT scenarios. To improve the quality of vessel trajectory records from AIS networks, we propose to develop a two-phase data-driven machine learning framework for vessel trajectory reconstruction. In particular, a density-based clustering method is introduced in the first phase to automatically recognize the undesirable outliers. The second phase proposes a bidirectional long short-term memory (BLSTM)-based supervised learning technique to restore the timestamped points degraded by random outliers in vessel trajectories. Comprehensive experiments on simulated and realistic data sets have verified the dominance of our two-phase vessel reconstruction framework compared to other competing methods. It thus has the capacity of promoting intelligent vessel traffic services in 6G-enabled maritime IoT systems.","short-term memory-based supervised learning technique,maritime traffic monitoring,recurrent neural nets,supervised learning technique,intelligent maritime navigation,data-driven applications,AIS networks,Internet of Things,Monitoring,neural networks,6G-enabled maritime IoT systems,vessel collision avoidance,time stamped point restoration,shipboard AIS devices,BLSTM,two-phase vessel reconstruction framework,spatial data,5G mobile communication,automatic identification system,maritime IoT applications,supervised learning,vessel traffic services,signal reconstruction,intelligent vessel traffic services,6G mobile communication,pattern clustering,vessel trajectories,Artificial intelligence,analogue-digital conversion,two-phase data-driven machine,raw AIS data system,telecommunication traffic,maritime Internet of Things (IoT),6G wireless systems,integrated automatic equipment,Trajectory,signal detection,vessel trajectory reconstruction,marine communication,automatic identification system (AIS),Navigation,maritime industries,bidirectional long short-term memory,combined satellite-terrestrial communication,data-driven trajectory quality improvement,massive trajectory data,future generation communication systems,"

"application of the jpda-ukf to hfsw radars for maritime situational awareness","2012","At the present day, growing interest is paid to the development of more reliable surveillance systems for maritime situational awareness (MSA). The purpose is to detect, track and classify cooperative and non-cooperative targets. For this reason, great interest is given to low-power/cost High-Frequency Surface-Wave (HFSW) radars as an early-warning tool for over-the-horizon (OTH) applications. However, in HFSW radars there is a trade-off in terms of quality and cost, i.e. the radar system exhibits poor azimuth resolution, high non-linearity, and significant false alarm rate. All these aspects reduce tracking performance if not properly addressed. In this context, the Joint Probabilistic Data Association (JPDA) with the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) is proposed.

"mimo unmanned surface vessels enabled maritime wireless network coexisting with satellite network: beamforming and trajectory design","2023","Due to the flexible deployment, unmanned surface vessels (USVs) have attracted much interest recently. To solve the resource scarcity problem at sea, USV needs to leverage existing terrestrial and satellite systems for efficient backhaul and spectrum sharing.

"a general orthogonal transform aided mimo design for reliable maritime visible light communications","2020","In maritime visible light communication (VLC) systems, user information is delivered among different terminals distributed in the atmosphere, and the underwater environment. To combat the complex and variant marine channel conditions induced by the absorption, scattering, and turbulence influence, in this article, we propose a general orthogonal transform (OT) aided multiple input multiple output (MIMO) transmission scheme to enhance the transmission reliability performances. In our design, we propose to construct the orthogonal transform matrix recursively with the Hadamard matrix. Thus we could exploit the repetitive property of the elements in the orthogonal matrix to enlarge the Euclidean distances among the signals. Moreover, the value of the elements could be adjusted dynamically to adapt to time-changing channel conditions. Thanks to the orthogonality of the matrix, and the singular value decomposition (SVD), the interferences among signals could be effectively suppressed. Accordingly, the reliability performances can be improved. Furthermore, we derive the theoretical symbol error rate (SER) expressions for the proposed design.

"a single-carrier delay-and-superposition based high spectral efficiency differential chaos shift keying for maritime internet of vessels","2022","The fast growing Internet of Vessels (IoV) requires maritime communications to be more spectral efficient to make full use of the scarce maritime spectral resource, provide a high data transmission rate and support massive communication nodes to access the network. However, the spectral efficiency of most existing maritime communications are still relatively low, and consequently maritime communications can hardly support high volume multi-user communications. Therefore, in this paper, a high spectral efficiency Differential Chaos Shift Keying system based on a single-carrier delay-and-superposition modulation technology (SCDS-DCSK) is proposed for IoV scenarios. In a SCDS-DCSK symbol, all sub-carriers have the same frequency, indicating that the symbol of SCDS-DCSK only occupies the bandwidth of a single sub-channel. As a result, a large amount of maritime communication resources can be saved for accommodating more communication nodes and the spectral efficiency is significantly improved. System architectures and principles are firstly demonstrated. Then, the spectral efficiency, peak mean power ratio (PAPR), complexity, and the origin of error bits of SCDS-DCSK are analyzed, and the bit-error-rate expressions are derived. Moreover, effects of various system parameters and levels of sea states on the system performance are simulated and discussed. Simulation results verify the theoretical analyses, and manifest that the SCDS-DCSK can achieve a high spectral efficiency under various sea states. Thanks to characteristics such as high spectral efficiency, flexible parameter configuration, and simple implementation, SCDS-DCSK is a promising technology for improving the quality of service (QoS) of future maritime IoV.","single-carrier delay-and-superposition,peak mean power ratio,QoS,quality of service,SCDS-DCSK symbol,PAPR,modulation,future maritime IoV,Vessels,chaos,maritime communication resources,error statistics,Maritime communications,spectral efficiency,single subchannel,single carrier delay,Modulation,superposition modulation technology,Sea state,fast growing Internet,support massive communication nodes,chaotic communication,consequently maritime communications,Frequency modulation,high data transmission rate,Symbols,high volume multiuser communications,Chaotic communication,marine communication,maritime Internet of Vessels,Spectral efficiency,Internet of Vessels (IoV),Internet,scarce maritime spectral resource,high spectral efficiency differential chaos shift keying system,maritime communications,"
"moving baseline localization for multi-vehicle maritime operations","2017","Development in autonomous systems in recent years have enabled an increase on multi-vehicle maritime operations. Air, surface and underwater vehicles are now able to cooperate to jointly accomplish the objectives of a shared mission plan. In multi-vehicle scenarios, knowing accurately the platforms position is of great importance. If the navigation error is not controlled, unexpected and undesirable events such as collisions, less reliable data or loss of platforms can occur. In environments where Global Positioning System (GPS) is denied, such as underwater, updating the global position for the platform is difficult and often requires taking specific actions which are not part of the original mission. In the underwater domain, this typically means getting a GPS fix on the surface. Breaching the surface is a time consuming and potentially dangerous or unfeasible task.

The least numbers shows the most important criteria to be considered before selecting the IT placement and the biggest numbers shows the insignificant considerations in making the decision. Finding shows the most important criteria in choosing IT placement are, they make their own decision to explore new experience, select company which is related to their area of study, choose company that provides allowances, eager to apply their knowledge and lastly the location of the company. The last three reasons in selecting industrial placement are, they do not prefer to have relative that work in their future internship placement, they do not follow their friends' decision and lastly they do not do their own research for future internship placement.","Industrial Training,Insurance,future internship placement,Transportation,Recruitment,industrial training,Maritime and Terminal Port Operation,terminal port operation organization,sea ports,Student Selection Criteria,maritime technology students,Security,science technology students,Government,civilian students,IT placement,"
"multi-use hf radar for arctic maritime domain awareness","2013","With the increased interest and presence that the U.S. Coast Guard has in the Arctic [1] there is also a rising need for increased Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) from autonomous sensors in this area. From June through November 2012, University of Alaska, Fairbanks (UAF) deployed and maintained three Long Range SeaSonde@ HF Surface Wave Radars operating in the 5 MHz band and two High Resolution SeaSondes operating in the 25 MHz band to map hourly ocean surface currents in the Chukchi Sea during the summer and fall. With funding from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) National Center for Islands, Maritime, and Extreme Environments Security (CIMES), UAF partnered with Rutgers University, a partner in the DHS Center for Secure and Resilient Maritime Commerce (CSR) and CODAR Ocean Sensors to demonstrate multi-use MDA capability of SeaSondes to provide vessel detections simultaneously with surface current maps near Barrow, Alaska. The Arctic region poses challenges to HF Radar vessel detection including: remote locations requiring specialized shelter, power and communications; extreme weather; the presence of ice floes, which have their own Doppler echoes in addition to sea clutter; and a different radio environment with auroral influences. Vessel detection results are shown with corresponding AIS data, the effect of diurnal ionosphere activity on HF Doppler spectra is shown and the performance of the UAF remote power module (RPM) is discussed.","surface current maps,marine radar,remote sensing,extreme weather,autonomous sensors,high frequency radar,radar detection,HF surface wave radars,maritime domain awareness,UAF remote power module,high resolution SeaSondes,vessel detections,Sea measurements,sea clutter,Noise measurement,HF Doppler spectra,Noise,multiuse HF radar,Oceans,multiuse MDA capability,Floors,vessel detection,diurnal ionosphere activity,arctic maritime domain awareness,CODAR ocean sensors,Doppler echoes,ocean surface currents,HF radar vessel detection,radio environment,ocean currents,Radar detection,"
"insights and guidance for offshore co2 storage monitoring based on the qics, eti mmv, and stemm-ccs projects","2020","Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is a collective term for technologies that allow society to unlock the benefits of energy intensive processes like fertiliser production and combustion of fuels (fossil or biologically sourced) without releasing the CO2 to the atmosphere. Hence, CCS could assist in accelerating decarbonisation while society pursues a just energy transition. This paper aims to summarise the learnings of three research projects that all investigated aspects of marine monitoring for CCS from a CO2 storage operator’s perspective. The QICS (Quantifying and Monitoring Potential Ecosystem Impacts of Geological Carbon Storage), ETI MMV (Energy Technologies Institute Measurement, Monitoring and Verification of CO2 Storage), and STEMM-CCS (Strategies for Environmental Monitoring of Marine CCS) projects collectively represent over twelve years of dedicated research to assess environmental impacts and to develop technologies for detection, location, and quantification of potential leakage from offshore geological storage of CO2. Each project used controlled releases in representative environments to test their methods and technologies. QICS as the first of the three projects, focused on the understanding of sensitivities of the UK marine environment to a potential leak from a CO2 storage complex and tested technologies to detect such emissions. The ETI MMV project brought together research and industry partners to develop and sea trial an operational, integrated and cost-effective marine monitoring system for geological CO2 storage. As a commercial project, these results have never been published before and this paper shares for the first-time insights from this work. In February 2020, STEMM-CCS, completed its quest to test techniques for environmental monitoring over a marine CO2 storage site in the UK North Sea, further improved near seabed leakage characterisation capabilities, and delivered a first marine CCS demonstration level ecological baseline. This paper aims to summarise some of the key insights from the three projects and provides references where available for the interested reader. The key finding of all three projects is that the impacts of small to medium CO2 leakages from large-scale storage are limited and localised. Technology capabilities exist for integrated marine CO2 storage monitoring and their performance has been benchmarked at controlled release trials. Even small leakages of 10−50 L/min can be detected at unknown locations in a large area of interest. Finally, the first important steps towards automated monitoring data analysis have been made, including automated leakage signal detection from Side Scan Sonar data (ETI MMV project) and automated species identification from marine biology images (STEMM-CCS project). Some remaining challenges include missed/false alerts because of large variations in the background signal, the cost of monitoring large areas over long periods, and making real-time decisions based on big data. Continued work to reduce the cost of marine monitoring technologies and advancing automation of data processing and analysis will be important in order to support safe and efficient offshore CCS deployment at large scale.","CCS,Location,Offshore CO2 storage,Regulation,Impact assessment,Quantification,Monitoring,Verification,Detection,Attribution,"
"identifying key features in aggregated real-life ais-messages for classification of maritime vessels by random forests","2023","Classification of vessels is a major task in many duties of maritime surveillance. In previous work, ad hoc approaches for classifying maritime vessels were applied to large sets of single AIS messages. The resulting performance has been explored based on real-life datasets in different maritime areas. The approaches were used in a particular application scenario of detecting AIS spoofing in fishery scenarios. Seeing good classification results, in particular by Random Forests, the questions arise whether these at least partly resulted from overfitting phenomena and which of the feature of classification in this problem are most relevant. To address these questions in the current contribution, AIS messages are aggregated per vessel and by the hour by statistical means providing a new AIS feature representation as a basis for classification. By providing a new data representation to the Random Forest classifier, we evaluate classification performance. Then we restrict the presented data to the semantic feature subgroups of the vesselâ€™s positional, course, speed, and dimensions data individually and identify the key features of the classification. The results show that in our exemplary maritime experiments, classification relies mostly on vesselsâ€™ positional and dimensional information.","Semantics,experimental comparison,aggregated messages,Random forests,Surveillance,Classification,Artificial intelligence,key features,Sensitivity,Task analysis,Behavioral sciences,performance evaluation,maritime surveillance systems,AIS,"
"the lsts software toolchain for persistent maritime operations applied through vehicular ad-hoc networks","2017","In order to further expand the sustainability of maritime operations the use of autonomous vehicles has been employed at an increasing scale. This natural increase comes not only in the form of the multiplication of the numbers of the same vehicle model, but also in diversifying the vehicle composition setup in order to allow the exploitation of different types of payloads. Moreover, this use of heterogeneous multi-vehicle teams allows overcoming individual limitations that one specific vehicle model might have. Nevertheless, this increase in scale and functionality also causes an increase in control, management, and spatial and operational complexity. This complexity is addressed in the framework of the LSTS Neptus-IMC-Dune software toolchain. The software toolchain is a framework for mixed-initiative control (humans in the planning and control loops) of unmanned ocean and air vehicles operating in communications challenged environments with support for Disruptive Tolerant Networking (DTN) protocols. The use of such a toolchain has allowed for repeated and successful deployments of heterogeneous multi-vehicle teams.

"low-cost, intelligent drifter fleet for large-scale, distributed ocean observation","2022","We have developed Persistent Environmental Awareness Reporting and Location (PEARL) ocean drifters. PEARL drifters are small, rugged, low-cost, autonomous, environmentally friendly ocean drifters that represent a significant opportunity for high-impact applications in both national security and environmental ecosystem monitoring. Drifters record and report data which is processed by advanced edge analytics before being compressed for satellite transmission to populate a large data repository with sensor data that is combined and analyzed to discover signals of interest in the ocean environment with the goal of increasing distributed maritime awareness. Each drifter is entirely self-contained, powered by solar panels and backup batteries, with a large array of sensors, compute module for onboard data processing, and satellite modem for data reporting. The drifter architecture is flexible and can be customized for a specific purpose. The complete data record is stored locally and processed by the onboard compute module, which runs anomaly detection algorithms that detect nearby activity. Anomalous events, as well as baseline environmental data, are reported to a cloud database using satellite short burst data transmission. Though each independent drifter is a powerful sensing tool, the low unit cost permits large scale deployment. To date thousands of drifters have been deployed over vast areas of the ocean and are reporting data to a remote database where cloud-based analytics algorithms develop global situational awareness and update local edge algorithms on the drifters based on learnings across the full network.","Satellites,data reporting,remote sensing,distributed ocean observation,complete data record,environmental ecosystem monitoring,Location ocean drifters,lagrangian drifter,intelligent drifter fleet,high-impact applications,anomaly detection,maritime domain awareness,drifter architecture,Persistent Environmental Awareness Reporting,Distributed databases,environmental data,vessel tracking,satellite communication,marine systems,Turning,oceanographic equipment,sensor data,advanced edge analytics,onboard compute module,cloud computing,ocean circulation,baseline environmental data,satellite transmission,Oceans,geophysics computing,data reduction,ocean environment,maritime awareness,satellite modem,data repository,edge processing,PEARL drifters,oceanographic regions,onboard data processing,Roads,cloud-edge algorithms,Cloud computing,national security,satellite short burst data transmission,Sensors,environmentally friendly ocean drifters,oceanographic techniques,"
"rainwater runoff retention on an aged intensive green roof","2013","Urban areas are characterised by large proportions of impervious surfaces which increases rainwater runoff and the potential for surface water flooding. Increased precipitation is predicted under current climate change projections, which will put further pressure on urban populations and infrastructure. Roof greening can be used within flood mitigation schemes to restore the urban hydrological balance of cities. Intensive green roofs, with their deeper substrates and higher plant biomass, are able to retain greater quantities of runoff, and there is a need for more studies on this less common type of green roof which also investigate the effect of factors such as age and vegetation composition. Runoff quantities from an aged intensive green roof in Manchester, UK, were analysed for 69 rainfall events, and compared to those on an adjacent paved roof. Average retention was 65.7% on the green roof and 33.6% on the bare roof. A comprehensive soil classification revealed the substrate, a mineral soil, to be in good general condition and also high in organic matter content which can increase the water holding capacity of soils. Large variation in the retention data made the use of predictive regression models unfeasible. This variation arose from complex interactions between Antecedant Dry Weather Period (ADWP), season, monthly weather trends, and rainfall duration, quantity and peak intensity. However, significantly lower retention was seen for high rainfall events, and in autumn, which had above average rainfall. The study period only covers one unusually wet year, so a longer study may uncover relationships to factors which can be applied to intensive roofs elsewhere. Annual rainfall retention for Manchester city centre could be increased by 2.3% by a 10% increase in intensive green roof construction. The results of this study will be of particular interest to practitioners implementing greenspace adaptation in temperate and cool maritime climates.","Rainwater runoff,Green roof,Sustainable urban drainage systems,"
"upper paleozoic mafic and intermediate volcanic rocks of the mount pleasant caldera associated with the sn–w deposit in southwestern new brunswick (canada): petrogenesis and metallogenic implications","2016","Upper Paleozoic (~365Ma) mafic and intermediate volcanic rocks of the Piskahegan Group constitute a subordinate part of the Mount Pleasant caldera, which is associated with a significant polymetallic deposit (tungsten–molybdenum–bismuth zones ~33Mt ore with 0.21% W, 0.1% Mo and 0.08% Bi and tin–indium zones ~4.8Mt with 0.82% Sn and 129g/t In) in southwestern New Brunswick (Canada). The epicontinental caldera complex formed during the opening of the late Paleozoic Maritimes Basin in the northern Appalachians. The mafic and intermediate rocks make up two compositionally distinct associations. The first association includes evolved rift-related continental tholeiitic basalts, and the second association comprises calc-alkaline andesites, although both associations were emplaced penecontemporaneously. The basalts have low Mg#~0.34–0.40, smooth chondrite-normalized REE patterns with (La/Yb)n~5–6, primitive mantle-normalized trace element patterns without noticeable negative Nb–Ta anomalies, and their ɛNd(T) ranges from +2.5 to +2.2. The basalts were generated by partial melting of a transition zone between spinel and garnet mantle peridotite at a depth of ~70–90km. The calc-alkaline andesites of the second association have chondrite-normalized REE patterns that are more fractionated, with (La/Yb)n~7–8.5, but without significant negative Eu anomalies. Compared to the basaltic rocks, they have lower ɛNd(T) values, ranging from +0.5 to +1.9, and their mantle-normalized trace element plots show negative Nb–Ta anomalies. The ɛNd(T) values display negative correlations with indicators of crustal contamination, such as Th/La, Th/Nb and SiO2. The andesitic rocks are interpreted to have formed by assimilation–fractional crystallization processes, which resulted in the contamination of a precursor basaltic magma with crustal material. The parent basaltic magma for both suites underwent a different evolution. The tholeiitic basalts experienced shallow-seated fractional crystallization and evolved along a tholeiitic trend of “early iron” enrichment (non-oxic conditions). The contaminated magma of the second association followed a calc-alkaline fractionation trend of “no iron” enrichment (oxidizing conditions) characterized by a high PH2O and PO2 environment at the mid-crust levels. The Piskahegan Group, which is associated with an important polymetallic mineral deposit, differs from the numerous non-mineralized rift-related volcanic suites of the regional Upper Devonian to Lower Carboniferous successions in the Maritimes Basin by the presence of a significant amount of coeval calc-alkaline andesite, which may be an indicator of potential mineralization.","Petrogenesis,Devonian,Sn–W deposit,Crustal contamination,Bimodal volcanic rocks,"

"exploring ais data for intelligent maritime routes extraction","2020","Maritime traffic route is the basis for the analysis of ship traffic characteristics and navigation safety. However, the spatial freedom of ship navigation makes the extraction of maritime traffic route a challenging task. In order to realize the extraction of ship traffic routes at sea, a maritime route extraction method based on ship history automatic identification system (AIS) data is proposed. In this method, the ship trajectory with rich position information is transformed into a ship trip semantic object (STSO) with semantic information, and each ship trip is abstracted as a “stop-waypoint-stop” trip object. In addition, based on the graph theory, the STSO is further integrated into the nodes and edges of a directed maritime traffic graph to realize the extraction and expression of the shipping routes. In order to prove the effectiveness of this method, the real-world AIS historical data are used for testing, and the results show that this method can effectively extract maritime traffic routes.","Automatic Identification System (AIS),Semantic trajectory,Shipping route,Maritime traffic,Graph theory,"
"subsea wellhead spud-in marking and as-built position estimation method based on ultra-short baseline acoustic positioning","2022","Positioning seabed objects in ultra-deep waters is critical in the mapping, exploration, and industrial exploitation of oceans. This paper presents research on a subsea wellhead positioning process for the marking of seabed positions and its subsequent as-built verification. The results indicate that the ultra-short baseline (USBL) acoustic technique can provide static positioning accuracy and precision comparable to those of a long-baseline method (LBL) and significantly reduces the time and cost of the offshore project. The new approach was tested at different stages of the process. First, an innovative offset transformation method, which increases the precision of alignments, was proposed, followed by a step-by-step procedure for determining the positions of marker buoys on the seabed based on spin tests and cardinal heading calibration. Finally, the M−estimation method, which has not yet been applied in subsea engineering, was implemented and proved to be a suitable alternative to the ordinary least squares method.","Subsea navigation,Seafloor mapping,Position estimation,USBL subsea acoustic positioning,Subsea offshore assets positioning,"
"time series analyses of tree ring chronologies from pacific north america: evidence for sub-century climate oscillations","1999","Tree ring-width chronologies from the west coast of North America were obtained from on-line data archives, maintained by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Data covered the period 1650–1983, for trees sampled at 43 sites between Dawson Creek, British Columbia (55°N) and Yosemite Park, CA (37°N). These time series were analyzed using Fourier transformation methods. Spyglass Transform software allowed the resulting power spectra to be stacked and compared, based on characteristics such as topography and continentality, latitude and species ecological niche. Results suggested that several regular or quasi-regular cycles are occurring over various time periods. There are some similarities, though not an exact match, with El Niño periodicities noted by earlier authors. These patterns appear to be widespread, affecting trees at various elevations and distances from the coast, and from different species. A separate analysis of the oldest trees revealed sub-century cycles. In particular, the longer fluctuations at 50–65 years are consistent with recent findings on north Pacific climate by other authors. A Euclidean cluster analysis of individual years identified unusual year groupings between 1924–1946, a period associated with positive temperature anomalies and generally higher precipitation. These findings appear to be consistent with other basin-scale climate cycles, like the Southern Oscillation, and the recently-proposed Pacific Interdecadal Oscillation (PDO).","Power spectra,El Niño,Pacific basin,Dendrochronology,Tree rings,Pacific Interdecadal Oscillation,Climate oscillations,"

The computed poles satisfy observed thrust faulting mechanisms in the northern Cherskii Mountains which are discordant with models proposed by previous workers.

"automatic fault detection in seismic data using gaussian process regression","2019","Compartmentalization of hydrocarbon reservoirs, change in fluid contacts, effects of high permeable fractures around faults, and hydrocarbon traps created by seal faults make fault detection and extraction as a necessity in the analysis of seismic data. Faulting disrupts the smoothness trend of geological layers (reflections in seismic sections) and displaces layers along its plane. Thus, a fault could be considered as an abnormal phenomenon that globally deviates normal behavior of layers around its plane. In the present study, faults are considered as sparse global anomalies in a seismic section that can be extracted using Gaussian process regression. The Gaussian process regression is a nonparametric probabilistic model based on Bayesian statistics that can be used to model spatial properties as a regression problem. The Gaussian process usually is used to extract and describe normal interactions from the data set using smooth functions. The main idea of this study is to detect the global anomaly using Gaussian process regression. For this purpose, we considered geological layers as smooth normal events in seismic sections. Therefore, the location of the fault plane is where the Gaussian process gets an error during describing the layers. Abnormalities such as faults cause the Gaussian process to suffer an error near the anomaly. We used these errors and analyzed them to detect probable locations of fault edge. Finally, we used a consistent connection algorithm to separate most probable fault points and to connect them to an edge using morphological reconstruction algorithm. The proposed algorithm was evaluated based on the receiver operating characteristics analysis. Several synthetic seismic sections with different levels of signal to noise ratios were used to evaluate the algorithm in the presence of random noise. The results showed that all points predicted by a diagnostic test fell into the area above the diagonal of the receiver operating characteristics space, which represents a good diagnostic classification.","Global anomaly detection,Gaussian process regression,Fault,Reconstruction morphology,"

"the aleutian low, storm tracks, and winter climate variability in the bering sea","2007","Previous studies have found inconsistent results regarding how wintertime conditions in the Bering Sea relate to variations in the North Pacific climate system. This problem is addressed through analysis of data from the NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis for the period 1950–2003. Composite patterns of sea-level pressure, 500hPa geopotential heights, storm tracks and surface air temperature are presented for four situations: periods of strong Aleutian Low, weak Aleutian Low, warm Bering Sea air temperatures, and cold Bering Sea air temperatures. Winter temperatures in the Bering Sea are only marginally related to the strength of the Aleutian Low, and are much more sensitive to the position of the Aleutian Low and to variations in storm tracks. In particular, relatively warm temperatures are associated with either an enhanced storm track off the coast of Siberia, and hence anomalous southerly low-level flow, or an enhanced storm track entering the eastern Bering Sea from the southeast. These latter storms do not systematically affect the mean meridional winds, but rather serve to transport mild air of maritime origin over the Bering Sea. The leading indices for the North Pacific, such as the NP and PNA, are more representative of the patterns of tropospheric circulation and storm track anomalies associated with the strength of the Aleutian Low than patterns associated with warm and cold wintertime conditions in the Bering Sea.","Aleutian Low,Winds,Storm tracks,North Pacific,Bering Sea,Climate variability,"

"geochemical and stable isotopic variability within two rivers rising under the same mountain, but belonging to two distant watersheds","2013","Complementary geochemical and stable isotope investigations of the Gorski Kotar karst aquifer system in western Croatia were obtained for the first time, to answer the question whether both studied rivers drain the same aquifer system or not. The two main rivers, the Kupa and the Rječina, rise under the same mountain range, but belong to two different watersheds (Black Sea and Adriatic Sea). The karst aquifer of Gorski Kotar is a potentially important source of drinking water for two neighboring countries, Croatia and Slovenia (Central and South Europe), and is strongly influenced by both Mediterranean and continental weather conditions. It is a part of the Dinaric karst, which is “locus typicus” for karst worldwide and one of the most typical karst areas in the world. To answer the main question of our research, baseline data were thoroughly collected comprising stable isotopes, concentration of dissolved and total trace metals in water, and multi-elemental analyses of river sediments, together with other physical-chemical parameters (pH, dissolved oxygen, electric conductivity and temperature). Total dissolved solid (TDS) was not measured but estimated as (EC) 0.67. Such multi-technique approach was applied for the first time in the Dinaric karst systems. Multi-elemental analysis of fine sediment fraction (<63μm) of eight samples was performed by ICP-MS. Elemental composition of sediments is quite different in the two studied river valleys, which indicates different origin of their waters. Also, concentrations of selected metals were compared with existing sediment quality criteria and anthropogenic influence is evaluated and discussed. Analytical results of major ions determined in three springs (Kupa spring, Rječina spring, Zvir spring in the City of Rijeka) were used to construct a Piper diagram, which showed that they are of a Ca–Na–HCO3–Cl type. The highest concentration of Mg is present in the Kupa spring, while the highest concentrations of Na and Cl are present in the Zvir spring. Groundwaters are underlain by limestone, less by dolomite and are under a maritime influence. There is a big difference with the main groundwater types reported in North Africa, i.e. in the south Mediterranean Sea, where two main groundwater types are Na–Cl and Ca–SO4–Cl. Concentrations of total and dissolved fractions of trace metals in surface water samples were determined by voltammetry and compared to the European Water Framework Directive values. Concentrations of total Pb and Zn are significantly higher in the water of the Kupa spring than the Rječina spring, suggesting that the karst water bodies of the two springs are not of the same origin. In addition, stable isotope composition (deuterium and oxygen-18) was determined in the spring waters sampled during low and high water conditions. Due to the significant difference in oxygen isotope-ratios it was concluded that the karst reservoir for the Kupa and Rječina springs is not identical. The results obtained from the combination of physical–chemical, geochemical (water and sediment) and isotope multi-technique analyses pointed out that even though the springs of the Kupa and Rječina rivers originate from the same mountain range, they do not drain the same karst aquifer.","Risnjak National Park,Kupa and Rječina rivers (Croatia),Stable isotopes (deuterium and oxygen-18),Water quality,Transboundary karst aquifer,Perhumid climate,Sediment and water chemistry,Physical–chemical parameters,"
"the recent sedimentation history of the esk estuary, cumbria, u.k.: the application of radiochronology","1984","The sediments of the Esk estuary, Cumbria, contain a variety of radionuclides which are derived from the British Nuclear Fuels Ltd (BNFL) reprocessing plant at Sellafield, Cumbria. In principle the total ecosystem of the Esk estuary is labelled with a variety of radionuclides which we have studied in order to investigate fundamental process which take place in estuaries; also to improve our knowledge of relationships which exist between the rate of release of radionuclides in the BNFL source term and their distribution in the Esk. On the basis of defined sampling procedures we have dated the rate of sedimentation for the major sediment types of the system using six different radionuclides, and four independent methods, including a procedure of statistical modelling. The model is based upon procedures for matching the shape of the BNFL radionuclide release profile over a period of ∼ 10 y, with that for the distribution of radionuclides in profiles of sediment cores. Good agreement is obtained for the match. In the Esk a large proportion of the radionuclides which are retained in sediments are associated with particulate matter and surfaces of sediment debris; in accreting sediments these deposits have not been disturbed during the past ∼ 30 y. In modelling the releases of radionuclides from point sources, attention needs to be paid to the chemical and physical composition of the source term, as this can influence the subsequent distribution of radionuclides in nearshore and estuarine marine ecosystems.",""
"a novel bias-tsp algorithm for maritime patrol","2023","This work aims to develop a search planning strategy to be used by a drone equipped with an inverse synthetic-aperture radar (ISAR) and an electro-optical sensor. After describing the specifics of our maritime scenario, we discuss four methodologies that can be used to find vessels involved in illegal fishing activities as quickly as possible. In addition to the clustering of the vessels, determined by the droneâ€™s electro-optical sensor range, we introduce a novel technique to bias a traveling salesman problem (TSP) tour. This bias is based on deliberately increasing distances to vessels that are classified as probable fishing vessels. This increase in distance is meant to prioritize visits to probable fishing vessels. Vessels are classified based on their length. The classification result and the vessel clustering are available before the actual planning of the tour. Simulations of scenarios in which we have a few vessels fishing illegally show that the novel technique, the bias-TSP, combined with a tour orientation based on operational considerations, outperforms the classic TSP: the mean distance traveled to find all the vessels involved in illegal fishing activities is reduced by at least 35â€“50%. We also show that different drone take-off locations significantly impact the results.","decision support systems,design of experiments,optical sensors,marine radar,Costs,remotely operated vehicles,Design of experiments,vessel clustering,Planning,travelling salesman problems,probable fishing vessels,novel bias-TSP algorithm,illegal fishing activities,traveling salesman problem (TSP),Traveling salesman problems,Optimization methods,synthetic aperture radar,pattern classification,search planning strategy,drone,pattern clustering,maritime scenario,Drones,Decision support systems,Optimization,drones,electro-optical sensor,inverse synthetic-aperture radar,probability,Surveillance,maritime patrol,Meters,traveling salesman problem tour,"
"geochemistry of redox-sensitive trace elements in a shallow subterranean estuary","2015","Submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) is an important component of chemical fluxes in the coastal ocean. The composition of SGD is influenced by biogeochemical reactions that take place within the subterranean estuary (STE), the subsurface mixing zone of fresh and saline groundwaters. The STE is characterized by redox gradients that affect the speciation and mobility of redox-sensitive elements (RSEs). We examined the distributions and behavior of the RSEs Mo, U, V, and Cr within the larger redox framework of a shallow STE and evaluated the source-sink function of the STE for these elements. We found that the advection of water through the STE and the apparent respiration of organic matter drives the formation of a “classic” redox sequence typically observed in diffusion-dominated fine-grained sediments. High concentrations of dissolved organic matter (up to 2.9mM) lead to extensive sulfide production (up to 1.8mM) within 3m of the surface. Both Mo and U are quantitatively removed as oxic surface waters mix into ferruginous and sulfidic zones. Molybdenum removal appears to occur where sulfide concentrations exceed ~11μM, a previously reported threshold for quantitative formation of highly particle-reactive thiomolybdate species. Uranium removal apparently occurs via reduction and formation of insoluble phases or sorption to sediments. It is not clear how readily sequestered metals may be returned to solution, but SGD may be an important sink in the marine budget for both Mo and U. In contrast, both V and Cr show non-conservative addition across the salinity mixing gradient. Increases in pH appear to promote dissolution of V from minerals within the shallow aquifer, and mobilization may also be associated with dissolved organic matter. Chromium enrichment is associated with higher dissolved organic matter and is likely due to the formation of soluble Cr-organic complexes. Fluxes of these elements were constrained using SGD volume fluxes, determined using radium isotopes as well as direct discharge measurements by Lee-type seepage meters, and concentrations in directly-sampled seepage (Mo: −0.21 to −7.7μmolm−2day−1; U: −0.02 to −0.6μmolm−2day−1; V: 0.05 to 2.0μmolm−2day−1; Cr: 0.12 to 4.4μmolm−2day−1).","Chromium,Uranium,Molybdenum,Submarine groundwater discharge,Redox sensitive elements,Subterranean estuary,Geochemistry,Vanadium,Trace metals,"
"satellite machine-type communication for maritime internet of things: an interference perspective","2019","Satellite machine-type communication plays a crucial role in the maritime Internet of Things. The realization of such a system, i.e., the VHF data exchange (VDES) satellite system, however, faces many technical challenges. Due to its global broadcasting nature, the interference generated from the emissions of the VDES satellite space stations to the incumbent or future land systems in the same band is of major concern to the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) spectrum allocation. However, neither regulatory rules nor related studies have been specified or made available in the literature regarding such interference. This paper utilizes the electromagnetic power flux density (PFD) mask concept for evaluating and constraining the emission onto earth from a satellite space station. The mathematical analysis and derivation are based on the principle that the actual interference from a space station that a land system experiences is no worse than that from any other land system allowed by the regulations. We demonstrate the derivation of such a PFD mask from three closely related regulations on the legacy land mobile systems by the Electronic Communications Committee (ECC) and ITU and present the corresponding constraints imposed on the VDES satellite system and their impacts on the performance of the system.","VDES satellite space station system,interference perspective,satellite machine-type communication,maritime machine-type communication,VHF data exchange satellite system,Internet of Things,Marine vehicles,satellite communication,electromagnetic PFD mask concept,Space stations,ITU,Electronic Communications Committee,e-navigation,electronic data interchange,Maritime Internet of Things,Artificial intelligence,space communication links,maritime Internet of Things,radiofrequency interference,ITU spectrum allocation,electromagnetic power flux density mask concept,Satellite broadcasting,ECC,mathematical analysis,land system experiences,land mobile systems,Interference,International Telecommunication Union spectrum allocation,"
"sea-ice reconstructions from bromine and iodine in ice cores","2021","As the intricacies of paleoclimate dynamics are explored, it is becoming understood that sea-ice variability can instigate, or contribute to, climate change instabilities commonly described as “tipping points”. Compared to ice sheets and circulating ocean currents, sea-ice is ephemeral and continental-scale changes to sea ice cover occur seasonally. Sea-ice greatly influences polar albedo, atmosphere-ocean gas exchange and vertical mixing of polar ocean masses. Major changes in sea ice distribution and thickness have been invoked as drivers of deglaciations as well as stadial climate variability described in Greenland climate records as “Dansgaard-Oeschger” cycles and described in Antarctic climate records as “Antarctic Isotopic Maxima”. The role of halogens in polar atmospheric chemistry has been studied intensively over the past few decades. This research has been driven by the role of bromine, primarily as gas-phase bromine monoxide (BrO), which exerts a key control on polar tropospheric ozone concentrations. Initial findings led to the discovery of boundary-layer self-catalyzing heterogeneous bromine reactions fed by sunlight and ozone, known as bromine explosions. First-year sea-ice and blowing snow have been identified as key components for this heterogeneous bromine recycling in the polar boundary layer. This understanding of polar halogen chemistry – supported by an expanding body of observations and modeling – has formed the basis for investigating quantitative links between halogen concentrations in the polar atmospheric boundary layer and sea-ice presence and/or extent. Despite the clear importance of sea-ice in paleoclimate research, the ice core community lacks a conservative and quantitative proxy for sea-ice extent. The most commonly applied proxy, methanesulphonic acid (MSA), is volatile and has not been demonstrated reliably for ice core records extending beyond the last few centuries. Sodium has also been applied to reconstruct sea-ice extent in a semi-quantitative manner although the effects of meteorological transport noise are significant. Contrary to a priori expectations, the halogens bromine and iodine appear to be stable in polar snow and ice over millennial timescales, addressing the temporal limitations of MSA records. Unfortunately, transport and meteorological variability influence sodium deposition as well as the deposition of halogens and the many other ionic impurities found in ice cores. The atmospheric chemistry of halogens is more complex than those of sodium or MSA due to the mixed-phase (gas and aerosol) nature of halogen photochemistry. Thus the application of halogen records in ice cores to sea-ice reconstruction overcomes some challenges posed by existing proxies, but also opens new challenges specific to halogens. Challenges common to all sea-ice proxies include the deconvolution of changes in emission source locations and changes in transport efficacy, particularly those occurring during climate transitions combining changes in sea-ice and atmospheric circulation, such as stadial/interstadial or glacial/interglacial climate variability. In this review, we describe the rationale and available evidence for linking the halogens bromine and iodine found in polar snow and ice to sea-ice extent. Reported measurements of bromine and iodine in polar snow and ice samples are critically discussed. We also consider aspects of halogen transport and retention in polar snow and ice that are still poorly understood. Overall, there is a growing body of evidence supporting the application of bromine to sea-ice reconstructions, and the use of iodine to reconstruct marine biological activity mediated in part by sea-ice extent. These halogens complement existing sea-ice proxies but most crucially, offer the capacity to greatly extend the temporal and spatial coverage of ice core-based sea-ice reconstructions. We identify knowledge gaps existing in the current understanding of spatial and temporal variability of halogen distributions in the polar regions. We suggest areas where polar halogen chemistry can contribute to a better understanding of the halogen records recovered from ice cores. Finally, we propose future steps for establishing reliable and constructive sea-ice reconstructions based on bromine and iodine as observed in snow and ice cores.","Greenland,Svalbard,Iodine,Southern ocean,Sea-ice extent,Severnaya Zemlya,Ice core,Bromine,Sea-ice reconstruction,Nordic seas,Antarctica,Halogen,Sea-ice,"

"unsupervised learning based coordinated multi-task allocation for unmanned surface vehicles","2021","In recent decades, unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) are attracting increasing attention due to their underlying capability in autonomously undertaking complex maritime tasks in constrained environments. However, the autonomy level of USVs is still limited, especially when being deployed to conduct multiple tasks simultaneously. This paper, therefore, aims to improve USVs autonomy level by investigating and developing an effective and efficient task management algorithm for multi-USV systems. To better deal with challenging requirements such as allocating vast tasks in cluttered environments, the task management has been de-composed into two submissions, i.e., task allocation and task execution. More specifically, unsupervised learning strategies have been used with an improved K-means algorithm proposed to first assign different tasks for a multi-USV system then a self-organising map (SOM) been implemented to deal with the task execution problem based upon the assigned tasks for each USV. Differing to other work, the communication problem that is crucial for USVs in a constrained environment has been specifically resolved by designing a new competition strategy for K-means algorithm. Key factors that will influence the communication capability in practical applications have been taken into account. A holistic task management architecture has been designed by integrating both the task allocation and task execution algorithms, and a number of simulations in both simulated and practical maritime environments have been carried out to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.","Unsupervised learning,Multi-task allocation,Self-organising map (SOM),K-means clustering,Unmanned surface vehicle (USV),"
"fault diagnosis for induction generator-based wind turbine using ensemble deep learning techniques","2022","Fault diagnosis in induction machines (IM) require effective detection at early stages to prevent permanent machine failure. This requires fast sensing of disturbances as well as efficient diagnosis methods. Conventional signal measuring techniques are usually intrusive, sensitive, with a low signal-to-noise ratio, and may show limited performance at incipient fault stages. Moreover, traditional machine learning (ML) diagnosis techniques based on handcrafted feature extraction methods suffer from limitations that can be overcome by deep learning (DL) with automatic feature extraction capabilities. In this paper, an online, non-intrusive method is proposed for fault diagnosis in a three-phase IM based on infrared imaging. The proposed method integrates three convolutional neural network (CNN)-based DL models (Inception, Xception, and MobileNet) to identify IM health status, fault types, and stator Inter-turn faults (ITF) location and severity. Deep features obtained from these CNNs are merged through Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) resulting in spatial-time-frequency features. This fusion reduces the input features’ size and improves diagnostic accuracy. Merged features’ length is further reduced using the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) where these reduced features are then used for classification. Compared to DL-based diagnosis methods introduced in previous work, the proposed method shows superior performance. First, it uses the IR images directly without the need for clustering and segmentation steps, thus saving time and effort. Moreover, ensembled DL is applied via combining the three CNNs benefits altogether rather than applying an individual DL method. Finally, unlike the huge features’ number exhibited by previous studies, the proposed approach uses minimal features, thus reducing classification complexity and time while maintaining 100% classification accuracy.","Renewable energy generating,Wind energy​ sources,Ensemble deep learning,Classification,Infrared thermal imaging,Fault diagnosis,Wind turbine inter-turn faults,Condition monitoring,"
"intelligent anomaly detection of trajectories for iot empowered maritime transportation systems","2023","The convergence of Maritime Transportation Systems (MTS) and Internet of Things (IoT) has led to the promising IoT-empowered MTS (IoT-MTS). However, abnormal trajectories of maritime transportation ships can have highly negative impacts on the management of IoT-MTS. Therefore, anomaly detection of trajectories is important for the successful deployment of IoT-MTS. In this paper, we propose a Transfer Learning based Trajectory Anomaly Detection strategy, named TLTAD, for IoT-MTS. Specifically, a variational autoencoder is used to discover the potential connections between each dimension of the normal trajectory, while a graph variational autoencoder is used to explore the spatial similarity between normal trajectories. Based on internal connection of trajectories, a deep reinforcement learning algorithm, Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic policy gradient (TD3), is employed to train the trajectory anomaly detection model. To reduce the model training time, transfer learning is used to migrate the trained anomaly detection model between different regions of an ocean area or between similar ocean areas. Moreover, an efficient data transformation module is designed to improve the efficiency of model transfer. The experiments were conducted on a real-world automatic identification system (AIS) dataset. The results indicate that the proposed TLTAD can provide accurate anomaly detection on shipsâ€™ trajectories in IoT-MTS with reduced model training times.","reduced model training times,Transportation,deep learning (artificial intelligence),Anomaly detection,maritime transportation systems,anomaly detection,Internet of Things,transportation,Marine vehicles,abnormal trajectories,Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic policy gradient,highly negative impacts,model training time,ships,IoT-MTS,trajectory anomaly detection model,deep reinforcement learning algorithm,Data models,normal trajectory,reinforcement learning,maritime transportation ships,Artificial intelligence,real-world automatic identification system dataset,Maritime Transportation Systems,graph variational autoencoder,trained anomaly detection model,Trajectory Anomaly Detection strategy,gradient methods,Deep reinforcement learning,model transfer,Trajectory,promising IoT-empowered MTS,intelligent Anomaly Detection,transfer learning,learning (artificial intelligence),data handling,Analytical models,"
"indoor positioning system based on ble location fingerprinting with classification approach","2018","Position estimation is an important technique for location-based services. Many services and applications, such as navigation assistance, surveillance of patients and social networking, have been developed based on users’ position. Although the GPS plays an important role in positioning systems, its signal strength is extremely weak inside buildings. Thus, other sensing devices are necessary to improve the accuracy of indoor localisation. In the past decade, researchers have developed a series of indoor positioning technologies based on the received signal strength (RSS) of WiFi, ZigBee or Bluetooth devices under the infrastructure of wireless sensor network for location estimation. We can compute the distance of the devices by measuring their RSS, but the correctness of the result is unsatisfactory because the radio signal interference is a considerable issue and the indoor radio propagation is too complicated to model. Using the location fingerprint to estimate a target position is a feasible strategy because the location fingerprint records the characteristics of the signals and the signal strength is related to the space relation. This type of algorithm estimates the location of a target by matching online measurements with the closest a-priori location fingerprints. The matching or classification algorithm is a key issue in the correctness of location fingerprinting. In this paper, we propose an effective location fingerprinting algorithm based on the general and weighted k-nearest neighbour algorithms to estimate the position of the target node. The grid points are trained with an interval of 2 m, and the estimated position error is about 1.8 m. Thus, the proposed method is low computation consumption, and with an acceptable accuracy.","Bluetooth low energy,Weighted k-nearest neighbor,k-nearest neighbor,Location fingerprinting,"
"an ins-aided mass autonomous navigation algorithm considering virtual motion constraints and the leeway and drift angle","2023","Autonomous navigation is one of the critical enabling technologies in developing MASS or intelligent ships. This study proposes an autonomous navigation algorithm with INS-aided shipborne GNSS. The proposed algorithm constructs the ship's virtual motion attitude by considering the leeway and drift angle, and takes into account the one-dimensional speed constraints in the virtual ship body reference frame. This approach addresses the issue that the conventional INS and shipborne GNSS integrated navigation scheme can utilize the three-dimensional position information only, without considering the measurement update from the one-dimensional speed obtained by shipborne GNSS. The algorithm is verified by actual ship departure and cruising experiments in natural marine environments. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has a higher accuracy than the conventional algorithm when the GNSS speed and position information are available. In the scenario when the GNSS position information is temporarily lost, the proposed algorithm can continue to derive relatively reliable navigation parameters for the safe navigation of ships with only one-dimensional speed measurement.","Leeway and drift angle,GNSS,INS,Autonomous navigation,Motion constraints,MASS,"

"characterization of a transmitter in a medium frequency maritime terrestrial navigation system","2019","Due to the worldwide recognition of increased jamming and spoofing events, which threaten the usability of global navigation satellite systems (GNSS), positioning systems using signals of opportunity are gaining importance as backup systems. Especially for maritime usage, a terrestrial system called Ranging-Mode (R-Mode) is under development. Among other signals, it utilizes the maritime medium frequency broadcasts of the differential GNSS (DGNSS) service. Currently, the estimation of phase in a time continuous medium frequency signal is used to determine the distance between transmitter and receiver. Here, the delay of a transmitter on the signal phase is of great interest, since it directly affects the performance of the R-Mode system. In this paper, the influence of a medium frequency power amplifier is characterized as part of the transmitter chain. The aim is to give the operators of DGNSS stations the possibility to characterize their station themselves when the R-Mode system is operational. Therefore, widely used measuring instruments are utilized, rather than using well-known cost-intensive techniques like phase delay measurements. A simple setup with different evaluation methods that fit this requirement is presented. Furthermore, it is capable of measuring the absolute time delay.

"passive microwave remote and in situ measurements of artic and subarctic snow covers in alaska","1991","Between 11 and 19 March 1988, airborne and satellite passive microwave measurements were acquired simultaneously with ground measurements of depth, density and stratigraphy of the snow in central and northern Alaska. Five aircraft flights were flown along a north-south transect between about 147 ° W and 152 ° W, and extending from about 63° N (south of Fairbanks, Alaska) to the Arctic Ocean coastline, with an Aircraft Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (AMMR) on-board operating at 92 GHz, 37 GHz, 21 GHz, and 18 GHz. Passive microwave data from the satellite-borne Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSMI), operating at 85.5 GHz, 37 GHz, 21 GHz, 18 GHz, and 10 GHz, were obtained concurrently. A good correspondence in brightness temperature (TB) trends between the aircraft and satellite data was found. However, an expected inverse correlation between depth hoar thickness and TB was not found to be strong. A persistent TB minimum in both the aircraft and the satellite data was detected along the northern foothills of the Brooks Range. In an area located at about 68° 50'N, 149° 20'W, the TB as recorded from the aircraft microwave sensor dropped by 55 K. Satellite microwave measurements showed a TB decrease of up to 45 K at approximately the same location. Snow pit measurements did not reveal notable differences in snow characteristics or depth in this location. An examination of passive microwave satellite data from 1978 to 1987 revealed that similar low latewinter TB values were found in approximately the same locations as those observed in March 1988. According to the satellite data, the zone of low TB develops as the snow deepens, and reaches the lowest values in March or April each year. The cause of this TB minimum is unknown but thought to be related to snow stratigraphy. The observed difficulty in relating the ground measurements to data collected using aircraft and satellite passive microwave sensors is attributed to the fact that the snow depth and character are highly variable in central and northern Alaska. This variability is exemplified in the field measurements as well as in the passive microwave measurements.",""

The involved experts assessed five criteria in terms of their significance: the availability of data on navigation on the selected section of the waterway, the availability of electronic navigation charts, the availability of hydrometeorological information, the availability of technical means of communication and navigational fencing. As a continuation of the research, it is proposed to study many qualitative and quantitative characteristics of both the area of the water area and the specialized equipment installed on it, since the operation of autonomous ships requires a more complex technical and information infrastructure.","knowledge of the water area,vessel traffic monitoring,DBSCAN,Autonomous navigation,maritime waterways,ships position clustering,automatic identification system,water transport system,expert system,"
"meteotsunamis at the río de la plata estuary","2022","A recent numerical study showed that low-amplitude meteotsunamis could be detected at the Río de la Plata (RDP) estuary. In this work, eight sea level series (one year long, 2018) were analyzed: six measured within the RDP estuary and two at the adjacent continental shelf. All meteotsunami events during 2018 were identified and analyzed at the RDP estuary, and the maximum wave height observed was 0.78 m. The atmospheric conditions during the analyzed events were investigated, showing that the presence of atmospheric cold fronts and atmospheric gravity waves seem to happen simultaneously with meteotsunami events. From sea-level observations gathered at the estuary it was inferred that the meteotsunamis could be driven by atmospheric forcings propagating (i) mainly from SE to NW (the meteotsunami would be driven along the estuary from the outer to the upper RDP, and the Proudman resonance mechanism could explain its amplification), (ii) predominantly from SW to NE (the meteotsunami would be simultaneously generated at different locations of the RDP estuary), or (iii) the meteotsunami could be generated in waters of the continental shelf, to get into the RDP estuary, and then freely propagates from the outer to the upper RDP (in this case the Proudman resonance mechanism would not explain the amplification within the estuary). It is important to mention that the results of the present investigation are biased to the high-period band of meteotsunamis because the sampling interval (20 min, for most locations) is rather large to allow the study of the whole meteotsunami frequency band.","Río de la Plata (RPD) estuary,Proudman resonance,Meteorological tsunami,Atmospheric cold fronts,Atmospheric gravity waves,"
"long-term observation of global nuclear power plants thermal plumes using landsat images and deep learning","2023","Thermal discharge from nuclear power plants poses a threat to the received natural water bodies, but the long-term extent and intensity of their surface thermal plumes remain unclear. In this study, we proposed a method to determine the background area for each drainage outlet and delineate the mixed surface thermal plumes based on 7,172 Landsat thermal infrared images. We further used a deep convolutional neural network integrated with prior location knowledge to extract core surface thermal plumes for 74 drainage outlets of 66 nuclear power plants worldwide. Our final model achieved a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 0.8998 and an F1 score of 0.8886. We found that the mean maximal water surface temperature (WST) increment of the studied plants globally was 4.80 K. The Tianwan plant in China experienced the highest WST increase (8.51 K), followed by the Gravelines plant in France and the Ohi plant in Japan (7.91 K and 7.71 K, respectively). The Bruce plant in Canada had the largest thermal-polluted surface area (7.22 km2). We also provided the dataset, Global Coastal Nuclear power plant Thermal Plume (GCNT-Plume), to describe the long-term occurrence of water surface thermal plumes. Three influencing factors of the water surface thermal plume were further analyzed in this study, including total capacity, drainage type, and location type, which were associated with operating power, drainage method, and geographical features, respectively. Total capacity was more statistically related to the maximum of WST increment under shallow drainage condition. The mean WST increment of shallow drainage was 1.22 K higher than that of deep drainage. Surface plumes larger than 4 km2 frequently occurred in the Great Lakes, while small surface thermal plumes (< 1 km2) were primarily found in estuaries. The proposed method provides an important framework for future operational water surface thermal plume detection using remotely sensed observations and deep learning.","Landsat,WST,Surface thermal plume,Deep learning,Thermal infrared remote sensing,Nuclear power plants,"
"identifying industrial heat sources using time-series of the viirs nightfire product with an object-oriented approach","2018","Carbon-based fuels burned at industrial facilities account for a large proportion of greenhouse gas emissions, and an up-to-date spatiotemporally detailed inventory is essential for a better understanding of global carbon emission patterns. The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Nightfire product offers a quantitative estimation of the temperatures of sub-pixel heat sources, providing the potential for detecting thermal anomalies from industrial sectors across the globe. However, identifying subcategories of various industrial heat sources is challenging because there are scarcely any stable and typical characteristics for their classification at a single thermal anomaly scale. Specifically, these nighttime thermal anomalies exhibit a strong spatiotemporal heterogeneity (e.g., fluctuations in retrieved temperature, spatial shifts in position, and presence of false positives), even in industrial heat sources that do not vary through time. Here, we demonstrate an object-oriented approach to robustly segment and accurately classify various industrial heat sources from a time-series of the VIIRS Nightfire product. The approach operates from the cluster level of spatially adjacent nighttime thermal anomalies (i.e., nighttime-heat-source objects rather than individual thermal anomalies) to generate fingerprint-like characteristics and to address the challenge of spatiotemporal heterogeneity. Specifically, the spatial-aggregation characteristic of nighttime thermal anomalies from continuously operating industrial heat sources and the temporal-aggregation characteristics of biomass burnings were incorporated to differentiate industrial nighttime-heat-source objects from ubiquitous biomass burnings. Subsequently, the similarity of the thermal signals of nighttime thermal anomalies from identical industrial heat sources was used to generate highly recognizable characteristics for their identification. A spatiotemporally detailed inventory of industrial heat sources across the globe was then established from this object-oriented classification. The inventory included a total of 15,199 industrial heat sources, representing 49.52% of all higher confidence nighttime thermal anomalies in the VIIRS Nightfire product. Validation of the results showed that only 218 objects (1.43%) were biomass burnings or active volcanoes that were misclassified as industrial heat sources. Further validation of sub-categories indicated an overall classification accuracy of ~77%. Our findings suggest that the VIIRS Nightfire product has great potential for monitoring the global distribution and dynamics of industrial heat sources, and combined with the object-oriented approach developed here the methodology is simple, robust, and cost-effective.","Nightfire product,Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS),Object-oriented analysis,Identification,Industrial heat sources,Time-series,"
"improbability mapping: a metric for satellite-detection of submarine volcanic eruptions","2014","Submarine volcanic eruptions can result in both real and apparent changes in marine algal communities, e.g., increases in phytoplankton biomass and/or growth rates that can cover thousands of square kilometers. Satellite ocean color monitoring detects these changes as increases in chlorophyll and particulate backscattering. Detailed, high resolution analysis is needed to separate the optical effects of volcanic products from the response of the marine algal community. It is possible to calculate an index, which maps the magnitude of improbable change (relative to long term average conditions) following known volcanic eruptions by using low resolution, initial estimates of chlorophyll and backscatter along with an archived history of satellite data. We apply multivariate probability analysis to changes in global satellite ocean chlorophyll and particulate backscatter data to create a new metric for observing apparent biological responses to submarine eruptions. Several examples are shown, illustrating the sensitivity of our improbability mapping index to known submarine volcanic events, yielding a potentially robust method for the detection of new events in remote locations.","Improbability mapping index,Satellite detection,Submarine volcanic eruptions,"
"maritime moving target long time integration for gnss-based passive bistatic radar","2018","This paper addresses the exploitation of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) as transmitters of opportunity in passive bistatic radar systems for maritime surveillance. The main limitation of this technology is the restricted power budget provided by navigation satellites, which makes it necessary to define innovative moving target detection techniques specifically tailored for the system under consideration. To this aim, this paper puts forward long integration time techniques able to collect the signal energy over long time intervals (tens of seconds), allowing the retrieval of suitable levels of signal-to-disturbance ratios for detection purposes. A local plane based technique is first considered, providing target detection in a plane that represents the section of maritime area covered by the radar antenna. As a suboptimum solution in terms of achievable integration gain, but more efficient from a computational point of view, a second technique is considered working in the conventional bistatic range and Doppler plane (basic plane based). Results against synthetic and experimental datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.","moving target detection,GNSS-based passive bistatic radar,navigation satellites,forward long integration time techniques,radar detection,passive radar,radar antennas,Transmitters,Doppler plane,signal-to-disturbance ratios,Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) based passive radar,target tracking,passive bistatic radar (PBR),local plane based technique,maritime moving target long time integration,satellite navigation,maritime surveillance,object detection,radar antenna,Global Navigation Satellite Systems,innovative moving target detection,restricted power budget,Doppler radar,Passive radar,marine communication,Receivers,Surveillance,Spaceborne radar,Global navigation satellite system,"
"a task allocation scheme generation method for maritime oil spill emergency monitoring based on bilateral matching","2022","Aiming at the task allocation problem of maritime oil spill emergency monitoring, the bilateral matching theory is applied to standardize the task allocation process and improve the emergency effectiveness. First of all, the task of maritime oil spill emergency monitoring and the monitoring subjects carrying out the tasks are identified, and the specific types, difficulties and risks of the tasks are identified. Then, the task type is introduced to indirectly express the relationship between â€˜monitoring subject-taskâ€™. On this basis, two concepts of task demand satisfaction and emergency monitoring subject capability competency are proposed to express the preference information of bilateral subjects. And then on the basis of redefining the specific connotation of the basic concept of bilateral matching theory under the background of maritime oil spill emergency monitoring task allocation, a bilateral matching model for task allocation of maritime oil spill emergency monitoring considering attribute priority is constructed. Finally, according to the specific characteristics of the model, a fast generation algorithm of feasible solution is designed to solve the problem.

"interception of chemicals at a forest edge for a rural low-lying site at black wood, hampshire, southern england","1994","Precipitation (rainfall and snowfall), throughfall, stemflow and net-precipitation (throughfall and stemflow) chemistry data are presented for a block-network of collectors located in a beech plantation in a rural area of southern England. The precipitation shows a variable chemistry linked to the relative supplies of material derived from maritime, pollutant and lithogenic sources. Inputs of solutes are spatially variable for those components associated with pollutant sources indicating local and variable sources for these constituents. Gaseous concentrations of SOx, NOx and NH3 all average ∼ 8 ppb outside the forest: within the forest, lower concentrations were observed. The precipitation — throughfall — stemflow results indicate that the trees capture occult deposition (i.e. non-precipitation detected atmospheric supplies of materials, e.g. from fine-droplets/mist, gases and particulate matter), thereby enriching the composition of stemflow and throughfall. Concentrations and fluxes of most solutes are increased by between 50 and 100%: only strontium, barium and hydrogen ions show a depletion. At the forest edge, there is an even greater difference between the precipitation and net-precipitation, especially for the sea-salts: the trees at the forest edge are particularly efficient at scavenging the occult materials. There are differences in chemical fluxes for the blocks that are not simply confined to an edge-interior division: this is most marked for manganese where cycling through the vegetation is dominant and the various locations respond in different ways. Despite storm damage there is little sign of a change in the chemical fluxes to the catchment: the loss of canopy is probably compensated for by an increased roughness that, in turn, results in increased turbulence, higher interception loss and greater scavenging.","Rainfall,Throughfall,Forest,Beech,Chemical,Interception,Stemflow,"
"chemical composition and provenance of chinese porcelain shards recovered from old goa, west coast of india","2017","During recent archaeological explorations at Old Goa, west coast of India, twenty three Chinese porcelain shards of the Ming (Middle to late 16th century), Qing (17th century) and late Qing period (late 17th century) have been recovered. In order to understand the nature and source of raw material and kilns, these shards were analysed for major elements with X-ray fluorescence (XRF), trace and rare earth elements by Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS). The analysis suggests that porcelain shards are siliceous in nature (SiO2~70%) and contain high Al2O3 (21.6%), Rb (388ppm) and Ba (160ppm) but have low Sr (48ppm). This composition suggests that the raw materials used for producing porcelain were silica, kaolinite and sericite which are characteristics of porcelains manufactured in Southern China. Comparatively, high Al2O3 (kaolinite) content in porcelains of the Qing Dynasty suggest improvement of quality, particularly mechanical strength, of Jingdezhen porcelain. In general, major element composition, trace metals, total rare earth elements (∑REE-67ppm) and their chondrite - normalized pattern of the Ming, Qing and late Qing period are nearly similar and appear to be made of identical raw materials.","Old Goa,Jingdezhen kiln,Chinese porcelain,Ming and Qing period,South China,Maritime trade,ICP-MS and XRF analysis,"

"the polynesian south ocean: features and circulation","1994","The hydroclimatic pattern of the French Polynesian zone is determined mainly by the pressure difference between the Easter Island High and the Western Equatorial Low. Trade wind activity is correlated with this gradient and drives surface oceanic water westward to produce the South Equatorial Current, which constitutes the northern part of a vast anticyclonic gyre in the South Pacific. High evaporation from the centre of the anticyclonic high results in the formation of hypersaline surface water, the Southern Tropical Water, which is dense enough to sink. This downwelling process removes plankton and particles from the euphotic zone and contributes to the strong oligotrophy of the gyre. Thermohaline pattern underlines the crucial role of vertical mixing processes in the upper mixed layer, which is isolated from the deeper Antarctic Intermediate Water by a stable pycnocline. Oceanic circulation measured in the band 140–145°W between latitudes 8–28°S during six HYDROPOL cruises (1986–1989) showed a weak (5–10 cm s−1) shallow (0–300 m) westward flow, South Equatorial Current, that was often dissected by small eastward countercurrents. The eastward component was increased considerably during the ENSO event of 1987 indicating an aperiodic forcing superimposed on the dynamic instability of the zone. Data gathered in the vicinity of barrier and atoll reefs showed that oceanic conditions (that is oligotrophic mixed layer) prevailed around these structures in spite of periodic thermal oscillations related to the tide regime. The Polynesian oceanic province being mainly in low dynamical conditions, vortex and eddies created around islands are insufficient to modify the vertical stratification or to pump up nutrients from the nutricline, that explains the absence of local upwelling or ‘island mass effect’. The permanence of a clear oligotrophic, euphotic layer then allows coral and reef communities to thrive and reach the atoll stage.",""

"the response of metal mobilization and redistribution to reoxygenation in baltic sea anoxic sediments","2022","To bring life back to anoxic coastal and sea basins, reoxygenation of anoxic/hypoxic zones has been proposed. This research focuses on the metals released during the oxidization of sediments from two locations in the anoxic Eastern Gotland Basin under a laboratory-scale study. Triplicate experimental cores and reference cores were collected from the North and South Eastern Gotland Basins. The oxygenation of the water column took place over a 96-hour experiment in a dark and 5 °C environment. In 12 and 24 hour intervals, the surface waters were exchanged and, over time, analyzed for pH, electroconductivity (EC), total organic carbon (TOC), soluble metal concentrations, and the top samples (0–10 cm) were analyzed with 3-step (E1: water-soluble, E2: exchangeable, and E3: organic-bound) sequential chemical extraction (SCE). Results show stable pH and decreasing EC in the column waters. The EC indicates that metals are released in the initial phases (12 h) of reoxygenation for both sites. Arsenic, Ba, Co, Mn, Rb, U, K, Sr, and Mo are released into the water column during the 96 hour experiment, and based on the calculations for the entire East Gotland Basin, would mean 8, 50, 0.55, 734, 53, 27, 347,178, 3468, and 156 μg L−1 are released, respectively. Elements Mn, Mo, U, and As are released in higher concentrations during the experiment than previously measured in the Eastern Gotland Basin, which provides vital information for future proposed remediation and natural geochemical processes with their known environmental impacts. The SCE results show that redox-sensitive metals (Mn, U, and Mo) are released in the highest concentrations into the solution. The relationship between the highest released metals (beside redox-sensitive) into solution over the oxygenation and their initial abundant phase is noticed, where the smallest released concentrations belong to K < Rb < Sr in E2, and As<Ba in E3, respectively.","Remediation,Eutrophication,Anoxic,Metal contamination,Water contamination,Sequential chemical extraction,"

"estimation of the diffusion coefficient of hygroscopic materials using a contactless transient thz water vapour content imaging and excitation device","2023","The investigation of humidity movement during drying or imbibition processes represents a serious challenge for several industries, such as the wood-based material industry and paper industry. Recently, several studies have been conducted on the efficiency contactless Terahertz technique (THz) to map the water content. In this study, this technique based on coupling infrared camera and developed Tera-Thermo-Converter, is used for the estimation of mass diffusion coefficient within hygroscopic materials initially dry. A water vapour water content excitation device is designed to excite the samples in a THz semitransparent enclosure during the monitoring. The recorded infrared films showed a pronounced mitigation of the signal over time, indicating penetration of vapour through the sample. Processing image techniques such as the four-image, algorithm and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and averaging are used to obtain the space-time water content map. A simplified one-dimensional model of mass transfer is proposed to estimate the diffusion coefficient using two inverse methods: a) a statistical method based on Bayesian approach, and b) a minimization method based on Levenberg‒Marquardt algorithm (LM). The results showed that THz imaging technique coupled with the appropriate processing and the adequate modelling, is able not only to map the water content field but also to monitor the transient transfer and estimate the diffusion coefficient without contact.","Mass transfer modelling,Inverse method,Image processing,Diffusion coefficient,Contactless monitoring,Terahertz technique,"
"a survey on uav-aided maritime communications: deployment considerations, applications, and future challenges","2023","Maritime activities represent a major domain of economic growth with several emerging maritime Internet of Things use cases, such as smart ports, autonomous navigation, and ocean monitoring systems. The major enabler for this exciting ecosystem is the provision of broadband, low-delay, and reliable wireless coverage to the ever-increasing number of vessels, buoys, platforms, sensors, and actuators. Towards this end, the integration of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in maritime communications introduces an aerial dimension to wireless connectivity going above and beyond current deployments, which are mainly relying on shore-based base stations with limited coverage and satellite links with high latency. Considering the potential of UAV-aided wireless communications, this survey presents the state-of-the-art in UAV-aided maritime communications, which, in general, are based on both conventional optimization and machine-learning-aided approaches.

"north atlantic forcing of millennial-scale indo-australian monsoon dynamics during the last glacial period","2013","Recent studies of the Last Glacial period Indo-Australian summer monsoon (IASM) have revealed links to both northern and southern hemisphere high latitude climate as well as to regional ocean conditions. Particular interest has been paid to the monsoon response to Heinrich events, with variability explained by meridional shifts in positioning of the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ), but this model has not been adequately tested. In addition, the shorter-lived Dansgaard/Oeschger (D/O) events have not been detected (beyond D/O-1, the Bølling/Allerød) in land-based records from the Indo-Pacific, despite their prominent expression in stalagmites from southern Asia, raising questions about the sensitivity of the IASM to these events. Here we present a Southern Hemisphere stalagmite oxygen isotopic time series from Ball Gown Cave (BGC), tropical northern Australia, located on the margins of the modern austral summer ITCZ, that spans 40–31 and 27–8 ka. Elevated IASM rainfall coincides with Heinrich stadials and the Younger Dryas, while decreased rainfall characterizes D/O interstadials, a response that is anti-phased with sites spanning the Indo-Pacific Warm Pool and with Chinese records of the East Asian summer monsoon. The BGC time series thus reveals a precipitation dipole consistent with a southward (northward) migration of the ITCZ during periods of high northern latitude cooling (warming) as the primary driver of millennial-scale IASM variability during the Last Glacial period. Our record indicates a strengthening of the IASM after the Younger Dryas period, likely as a result of rising sea level and sea surface temperatures, breaking the link with the high latitudes.","Last Glacial Maximum,Oxygen isotope,Indo-Australian summer monsoon,Kimberley,Stalagmite,"

"anti-jitter beamforming design for uav-assisted maritime monitoring networks","2023","With the wide application of Internet of Things systems in the smart ocean, many unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) have been deployed jointly with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to monitor the maritime environment. However, conventional means of maritime communication prevent the UAV and the USV from providing high-rate services owing to complex maritime channel conditions and limited bandwidth, which will affect the maritime environment monitoring performance. In this paper, we propose a USV-UAV collaborative patrol scheme for maritime environment monitoring networks. Considering the characteristic of energy concentration in beamforming and the beam deviation caused by UAV jitter due to the harsh ocean condition, we studied an adaptive anti-jitter beamforming problem in UAV-assisted maritime environment monitoring networks. Specifically, we decompose the adaptive anti-jitter beamforming problem into two subproblems.

"detecting co2 leakage at offshore storage sites using the covariance between the partial pressure of co2 and the saturation of dissolved oxygen in seawater","2018","An option to detect CO2 leakage from deep geological storage under the seabed is monitoring the partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) in the sea. One of the challenges of this technique is to differentiate pCO2 elevations caused by CO2 leakage from variations in the natural baseline (which varies due to seasonal and other factors). This paper compares a covariance threshold for anomalous pCO2 (a threshold based on pCO2 and dissolved oxygen), with annual and seasonal constant thresholds, using data observed in two hydrologically contrasting areas in Osaka Bay, Japan. In one of these locations the water column is typically stratified throughout the year, whereas at the other it is vertically mixed. The covariance threshold often but not consistently outperforms the constant thresholds, but is effective in all the cases analyzed in the present study. In any season in the mixed area, and in winter in the stratified area, the possibility of false-negatives in the seasonal threshold method is smaller than or comparable with that in the covariance threshold one. In areas with large natural pCO2 variations, such as during summer in the stratified area, the covariance threshold method is efficient in detecting CO2 leakage whereas the seasonal threshold method is of little use. With a good understanding of local conditions, monitoring pCO2 with the covariance threshold method is a potentially useful but not sufficient option for leakage detection in the marine environment.","Dissolved oxygen,CO leakage,Coastal ocean,Monitoring,Detection,Partial pressure of CO,"
"application of iot to monitor the shipping of goods in maritime transportation system","2022","Surprising occurrences like temperature variations, humidity shifts, and vibrations might devalue the products being carried. ICT must be used to stop unwelcome occurrences from happening and fix some problems with the delivery of products. Making it possible to monitor the conditions of storage and transportation of products is one of the main issues. The IoT offers opportunities for tracking and locating goods from point of origin to point of destination and for monitoring traffic conditions. IoT-based solutions make it possible to identify the circumstances around certain delivery procedure abnormalities, including their timing, location, and cause. Additionally, these systems offer the ability to inform the client, transportation providers, or other participants to request urgent help. Businesses may enhance their product portfolio, improve the competitiveness of their business, and enhance route travel times and transportation circumstances. As a result, IoT technology can be advantageous to all parties involved in the logistics chain.

"gis-enabled maritime awareness system (gmas)","2009","Being aware of maritime activities is important for homeland security. We have worked with the US Coast Guard to develop a waterway visual surveillance system on Elba Island, in Savannah, GA for maritime awareness. With the system, we developed an enhanced temporal difference algorithm based on active zone (ETD-AZ) to detect waterway moving objects, including container ships, commercial vessels, small vessels, sailboats, tugboats, and dolphins, etc. In the algorithm, active zone is first defined to model the imaging locations of moving objects that appear in the waterway; the model reduces noises caused by winds, clouds, and waves in the near-view fields. A thresholded difference map is computed by using temporal difference and thresholding methods. The thresholded difference map is further processed by applying morphological operations to remove noises. A final decision rule is derived to decide whether an image contains moving objects or not based on motion pixels in thresholded difference map and in the difference map after morphological operation. The proposed ETD-AZ algorithm has been tested using 21, 844 night and day images taken from Aug. 1-2, 2008, in different weather conditions: sunny, cloudy, windy, stormy with lightening, etc. The algorithm detected 89 of 94 waterway moving objects with 5.3% false negative rate while maintaining a low false positive rate of 4.0% for a total of 21, 478 non-object images.

"elemental constituents of atmospheric aerosols in recife, north-east brazil","1982","Few data are available on the inorganic atmospheric pollution in the rapidly expanding cities of South America, like Recife, on the Atlantic Coast of North-east Brazil. Therefore, the elemental composition of atmospheric aerosols was investigated for nine sites in the Recife conurbation and a fairly remote site in the area. Total aerosol samples were collected on cellulose filters for analysis by energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence and cascade impactors were used to collect the aerosols as a function of particle size for subsequent analysis by proton-induced X-ray emission. Local soil aliquots were also analysed. About eighteen elements were quantified in all cases. The average total atmospheric concentrations appeared to be well above natural levels but usually lower than, or comparable with, those of North American and European cities. Dispersal of sea spray and of local soil (often contaminated with, for example, Cu, Zn and Pb from industrial sources) contributes predominantly to the total atmospheric load in Recife. However, the particle size fraction results also indicated strong excesses in the small particle mode for S, K, V, Mn, Ni, Cu, Zn, Br and Pb, mainly in the downtown area. Again, the corresponding enrichment factors were only moderate in comparison with other published urban data.",""
"leveraging graph and deep learning uncertainties to detect anomalous maritime trajectories","2022","Understanding and representing traffic patterns are key to detecting anomalous trajectories in the transportation domain. However, some trajectories can exhibit heterogeneous maneuvering characteristics despite confining to normal patterns. Thus, we propose a novel graph-based trajectory representation and association scheme for extraction and confederation of traffic movement patterns, such that data patterns and uncertainty can be learned by deep learning (DL) models. This paper proposes the usage of a recurrent neural network (RNN)-based evidential regression model, which can predict trajectory at future timesteps as well as estimate the data and model uncertainties associated, to detect anomalous maritime trajectories, such as unusual vessel maneuvering, using automatic identification system (AIS) data. Furthermore, we utilize evidential deep learning classifiers to detect unusual turns of vessels and the loss of transmitted signal using predicted class probabilities with associated uncertainties. Our experimental results suggest that the graphical representation of traffic patterns improves the ability of the DL models, such as evidential and Monte Carlo dropout, to learn the temporal-spatial correlation of data and associated uncertainties. Using different datasets and experiments, we demonstrate that the estimated prediction uncertainty yields fundamental information for the detection of traffic anomalies in the maritime and, possibly in other domains.","Monte Carlo methods,classification,recurrent neural nets,graph,deep learning (artificial intelligence),Anomaly detection,DL models,graph-based trajectory representation,automatic identification system data,Monte Carlo dropout,graphical representation,traffic movement patterns,detect anomalous maritime trajectories,Predictive models,regression analysis,evidential deep learning,marine engineering,Data models,data patterns,pattern classification,Artificial intelligence,graph theory,RNN,regression,clustering,uncertainty,Trajectory,Uncertainty,probability,Computational modeling,traffic engineering computing,recurrent neural network-based evidential regression model,deep learning uncertainties,AIS data,"
"concentrations of organotin compounds and imposex in the gastropod hexaplex trunculus from the lagoon of venice","2004","In four stations located close to the channels connecting the Lagoon of Venice with the Adriatic Sea (two inside the lagoon and two outside it), individuals of Hexaplex trunculus were collected in order to assess their contamination. Concentrations of some organotin compounds, i.e. tributyltin and triphenyltin with their di- and mono- substituted metabolites, were measured and endocrine disruption such as imposex (superimposition of male sexual characteristics on females of gonochoristic gastropods) was observed. Vas deferens sequence indexes (VDSI) of 4.1–4.9 were found in organisms from stations inside the lagoon, and 3.6–4.2 in the sea stations. Organotin derivatives were measured in both the visceral coil and the rest of the soft body of the organisms. Total concentrations of butyltin compounds ranged from 102±17 to 432±27 ng Sn g−1 d.w. in the visceral coil, and from 96±24 to 297±107 ng Sn g−1 d.w. in the rest of the soft body. Phenyltins were found at far lower concentrations, ranging from 8±1 to 41±3 ng Sn g−1 d.w. (visceral coil) and from 0.25 to 32±22 ng Sn g−1 d.w. (rest of soft body). The degree of imposex in female gastropods, evaluated from VDSI and penis lengths, was related to organotin contents in the soft body. In particular, female penis lengths were significantly correlated (r=0.917 and r=0.982, P<0.05) to tributyltin (TBT) contents and the sum of organotin compounds in organisms.","Triphenyltin,Imposex,Lagoon of Venice,Tributyltin,"

For the low resolution mode a probability of successful image formation no matter the azimuth position of the receiving UAS has been estimated at nearly 100%. Whereas, for the high resolution mode it decreases to about 90%, which, if deemed unsatisfactory for the application, leads to the need for UAS to adapt its route to the actual Galileo satellite coverage.","Unmanned aerial systems,Bistatic synthetic aperture radar,Parasitic remote sensing,Civil security,Galileo constellation,"

"algorithm design of maritime wireless communication resources based on interference alignment","2022","With the increasing tension of wireless spectrum, interference has become a bottleneck problem in future wireless communication, and the urgency of interference management is particularly prominent. Traditional interference management methods have the defects of low spectral efficiency or limited interference. As a technology that can effectively improve network freedom and spectral efficiency, interference alignment can obtain greater gain compared with traditional methods, and has great potential in theory. As an effective means of interference management, interference alignment technology has been widely studied, and the difficulty of interference alignment is how to design the precoding matrix at the transmitting end and the decoding matrix at the receiving end, so as to meet the needs of system freedom. In the field of modern maritime communication, there are more and more application fields based on wireless technology, such as maritime detection, target detection and scheduling, which need to use wireless resources for data transmission, while maritime wireless resources are very tight.

"local summer insolation and greenhouse gas forcing drove warming and glacier retreat in new zealand during the holocene","2021","Geological climate archives from the Holocene Epoch provide baseline information concerning natural climate variability. Temperate mountain glacier extent is sensitive to summer air temperature, thus geological records of past glacier length changes are a useful proxy for this climatic variable. Here we present a new cosmogenic 10Be chronology of glacier length changes at Dart Glacier in the Southern Alps, New Zealand. Prominent moraines deposited 321 ± 44 yr ago (n = 11) and 7.8 ± 0.3 ka (n = 5) show glaciers during the Little Ice Age were less extensive than during the early Holocene. This pattern of net Holocene glacier retreat is consistent with emerging data from other catchments in New Zealand and across the southern mid-latitudes. Using the physical framework of a transient global climate model simulation, we suggest that cool summers in the early Holocene were promoted by the local summer insolation minimum, together with low atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations, causing an early Holocene austral glacial maximum. An insolation-driven reduction in seasonality at southern mid-latitudes may reconcile differences between early Holocene temperature reconstructions where climate proxies have different seasonal sensitivities. We suggest that rising greenhouse gas concentrations after 7 ka caused regional-scale glacier retreat and appear to be the dominant driver of multi-millennial summer temperature trends in the southern mid-latitudes during the present interglacial.","Glaciation,Moraine chronology,Geomorphology,Southern Hemisphere,Little Ice Age,Southern Ocean,Paleoclimate modeling,Holocene,Cosmogenic surface exposure dating,New Zealand,Glacial,"
"the lama system: a “smart” magnetometer network for harbour protection","2022","This work describes the development of an underwater anti-intrusion system based on a magnetometer self-informed network, whose purpose is to detect the presence of threats in the proximity of critical infrastructures (e.g, terrorist divers in harbours). In this context, the magnetic network fills the gaps of sonar systems at the critical boundaries of the water volume to be controlled (sea bed, docks, …), where acoustic performances deteriorate due to reflections and attenuations. The system operates in a port-protection scenario, characterized by a medium-high environmental magnetic noise that can hide the diver signal (a diver is a weak, quasi-point-like, moving source). The magnetometer network processes two inputs: the environmental magnetic noise and a signal including the target magnetic signal superimposed to the same noise; the frequencies of a diver signal lie within the noise band, hence frequency filtering proves inadequate for noise removal. The basic idea underlying the system is to measure and use the noise itself to filter the overall signal; measuring noise supports a background-subtraction process that allows to extract the target signal and therefore detect the threat presence. The effectiveness of the procedure depends on the positions of magnetometers: sensors must be close enough to one another to measure the common background noise, and, at the same time, should be distant enough from one another so that just one sensor can measure the target signal. To generate alarms when a threat is detected, a real-time software application processes data and activates a visual and acoustic alarm upon identification of a magnetic anomaly. Sea trials carried out in port areas provided extremely satisfactory results in the detection of intruders. The paper presents experimental results obtained during the method validation tests, when intruders were moving in the surrounding undersea environment.","Environmental magnetism,Marine geophysics,Time series analysis,Magnetic anomaly detection,Underwater magnetic systems,Harbour protection,"
"upper mississippi pb as a mid-1800s chronostratigraphic marker in sediments from seasonally anoxic lakes in eastern canada","2013","Sediment cores from eight headwater lakes located in Southern Québec, Eastern Canada, were analyzed for Pb, stable Pb isotopes, and the radioelements 210Pb, 137Cs, 241Am and 226Ra. The depth profiles of stable Pb isotope ratios show, for the post-19th century period, the influence of several isotopically distinct anthropogenic lead sources, mainly including emissions from two Canadian smelters and from leaded gasoline combustion in Canada and in the United States. A most interesting feature of the profiles, however, is the presence of sharp stable Pb isotope ratio peaks near the depth horizon, where excess 210Pb becomes undetectable. Using a binary mixing model and assuming that natural Pb concentrations and isotopic compositions from the catchment are given by the pre-industrial sediments at the bottom of the cores, we find that a significant part of the anthropogenic Pb supplied to the sediments at this horizon originated from smelting activities in the Upper Mississippi Valley. We assess that the Pb isotope ratio peaks, also observed in the laminated sediments of the Pettaquamscutt Estuary, Rhode Island, USA, are an accurate chronostratigraphic marker for the validation of mid-19th century 210Pb-derived dates. Given that the study lakes are located up to 2000km from the Mississippi Valley, we conclude that this isotopic Pb signal provides a widely distributed time-marker that is key to validate 210Pb chronologies in environmental archives from Eastern North America.",""
"comparative analysis of positioning capability of beidou and gps in maritime islands","2022","After the full deployment of the Beidou-3 global satellite navigation system constellation, the positioning service range has been expanded from the Asia-Pacific region to the whole world. At present, most of the research on the positioning capability of Beidou system is on the mainland, and there is still room for research on the positioning capability of islands at sea. In this paper, the data of four IGS tracking stations distributed in islands are selected and solved by Anubis software. The visualization of Beidou and GPS is analyzed in five aspects: satellite visible number, standard single point positioning error, DOP value, signal-to-noise ratio, and multi-path effect. The results show that: (1) In the Asia-Pacific region, the positioning accuracy of Beidou's maritime islands is better than 0.734 m, 0.724 m, and 2.115 m in the N, E, and U directions, respectively, which is basically equivalent to GPS. Whereas, it is roughly 3 m, 3 m and 6 m lower than GPS outside the Asia-Pacific region, and the average number of visible satellites of Beidou in ANMG station and SOLO station is 15 and 11 respectively, which presumably means that the satellite density of Beidou system in the Asia-Pacific region is higher. (2) The average values of signal-to-noise ratio and multipath error of C22, C23, C24 and C25 stars of BeiDou are 41.638 dBHz and 0.574 m, respectively, which are basically comparable to those of G01, G02, G03 and G04 stars of GPS.

When using wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technologies in maritime, nevertheless, it endures from situations where the measurement information is inadequate. In computing and networking for maritime applications, Wireless Sensor Network (WSNs) is a rising inflexion because of its amazing features. Simultaneously, there are some challenges faced by WSNs and node localization is one of them. Node localization is an important factor because until the location of reporting node is unknown, the data sensed by that node is totally useless. The main aim of this paper is towards gaining more improvement in localization by using swarm intelligence algorithm. To achieve this aim, a range-free and distributed method by using the application of salp swarm algorithm for moving target node in network for maritime rescue is proposed.

The scheme generation is mainly divided into two parts: task decomposition and resource scheduling. Then a task decomposition method based on genetic algorithm is established by learning the expert scheme.

"maritime containers tracking trial results","2009","There are approximately 7 million maritime-style containers within Canada, and 70 million within the US. The interiors of such containers are rarely inspected. With market globalization, a large amount of these containers enter North America on a daily basis. Such containers may include contraband or dangerous items that present an economic or security risk. Despite significant security improvements, only 3 to 5 % of the maritime containers, that arrive in, or transition through, North America, go through physical inspection. Current container tracking technologies based on GPS consume high DC power, are costly, require line-of-sight with satellites, and are often too large to be covert. It is possible to overcome some of these limitations by basing the tracking system on the FM broadcast signal which is an alternative man-made signal that is reasonably ubiquitous, provides a geographically-unique frequency spectrum and is about 100,000 times as strong as a GPS satellite signal. This allows the development of a low-cost, low-power and miniature FM receiver that can record frequency spectrums and compare them to known data in order to trace the path that the container has taken for less than $10 per container. This presents the first results of highway trials (train and sea trials are currently being conducted) of such a low-cost, covert, non-GPS based technology (called 'FM Tag') that records the worldwide displacement of containers and displays the path undertaken by the container while in transit. As an added security benefit, the tag is also capable of detecting container door openings. In addition to presenting the first trial results, this covers the innovative engineering aspects of using the metal enclosure of a maritime container as a VBF antenna, thereby eliminating the need to add an external antenna and achieving the goal of being 100% covert.","maritime containers tracking,US,Inspection,Canada,VHF antennas,Global Positioning System,FM broadcast signal,metal enclosure,Containers,Globalization,frequency spectrum,containers,market globalization,GPS,Satellite broadcasting,North America,Frequency,Road transportation,container tracking technologies,VHP antenna,Power generation economics,Security,"
"intelligent marine area supervision based on ais and radar fusion","2023","A weighted track fusion algorithm is proposed to address the complexity of conventional sea monitoring data and the lack of effective and convenient monitoring methods. The new algorithm uses local information entropy and fuses data from the automatic identification system (AIS) and X-band radar. The new model employs ship monitoring data to detect five types of abnormal ship behavior: speed, course, position, ship spacing, and time abnormalities. The method weights various factors using a weight matrix built up from a distance difference matrix between different track points and calculations of the distance information entropy and residual degree using information entropy theory. We tested the proposed weighted track fusion algorithm the fusion accuracy using actual data for 2813 ships, AIS, and radar track points based on local information entropy. The resulting correlation accuracy was 95.54% for 2716 ship track points and a correlation accuracy of 90.72% for 97 ship tracks. The results indicate that the proposed algorithm is suitable for fusing multiple tracks and is more robust than traditional fusion methods.","Intelligent supervision,Abnormal behavior,Radar,AIS,"
"quantification of lightning-induced nitrogen oxide emissions over europe","2019","In this study, the importance of lightning-generated NO over Europe in the year 2010 is assessed with the COSMO-CCLM - SMOKE-EU - CMAQ chemistry transport modeling system. Lightning data from TRMM satellite flash density data climatologies are taken and linearly fitted to convective precipitation climatologies. With the resulting linear model, lightning activity in 2010 is calculated based on the convective precipitation rate from model data. This approach combines the globally available satellite observations with the simplicity of linear convective rain parameterizations. It provides a new method for fitting lightning data for linear flash density parameterizations. Compared to other linear flash rate approaches or the very common cloud top height parameterization, the data for 2010 derived by the climatologies and actual 2010 precipitation data better matches the TRMM observation data. Lightning was found to be the second most important natural source after nitrogen monoxide emission from soil, with an annual average amount of 0.295 Tg N per year and an amount in 2010 of 0.278 Tg N. While it is less important for near-surface concentrations, it has a considerable effect on the nitrogen deposition in southern and eastern Europe and a large effect on the NO2 concentration in higher model layers. The effect in higher atmospheric layers over eastern Europe is 6 times larger than the effect of aircrafts on the air concentration of NO2 in the mid- and high altitudes. Comparisons with NO2 observations from the OMI satellite revealed that lightning NO emissions have an observable impact on the NO2 column density over Europe.","Chemistry transport modeling,Lightning NOx,Nitrogen dioxide,Natural emissions,"
"wireless channel models for maritime communications","2018","Recently, broadband maritime communication has attracted much attention due to the rapid development of blue economy. In addition to the conventional MF/HF/VHF bands, there has been increasing interests in the utilization of higher frequency bands to provide broadband data service to the sea area. To design efficient maritime communication systems, the first and a fundamental requirement is to develop a framework to understand the wireless channels. In an integrated air-ground-sea communications network, there are two major type of channels to be investigated, namely the air-to-sea channel (e.g., for communication links from the aircraft-based base stations or relays) and the near-sea-surface channel (for land-to-ship/ship-to-land or ship-to-ship communications). Due to the unique features of the maritime propagation environment such as sparse scattering, sea wave movement, and the ducting effect over the sea surface, the modeling of these maritime channel links differs from conventional terrestrial wireless channels in many aspects and, consequently, will result in significant impact on the transceiver design. In this survey, we highlight the most notable differences from the modeling perspective as well as the channel characteristics for the air-to-sea and near-sea-surface channel links, with more focus on the latter. After a thorough review of existing modeling approaches and measurement campaigns, we conclude that the sparse and the location-dependent properties constitute the most important and distinctive characteristics of the maritime wireless channels. As such, we further remark on the challenges and research topics for future development of maritime communications.","evaporation duct,beyond line-of-sight,Wireless communication,Sea measurements,channel model,Channel models,Fading channels,Atmospheric modeling,Scattering,finite scattering,Maritime communications,"
"5 - ice surface temperatures in the arctic region","2019","The Arctic currently provides some of the most visible indicators of climate change. The perennial sea ice cover has shrunk by >50% in the last 35years. Many glaciers have lost 40% of their volume during the last century, and the Greenland ice sheet has been losing mass at the rate of 250gigatons/year. Warming is amplified by as much as three times in the Arctic compared to the global average, and the influence of enhanced surface temperature is manifested in the entire high-latitude region. This chapter describes the ability of satellite sensors to provide consistent basin-wide distribution of surface temperature in the Arctic region and vicinity. Satellite data provide insights into the actual spatial and temporal variability of surface temperature in the Arctic region.","Thermal infrared,Snow,Ice surface temperature,Ice sheet,Glaciers,Sea ice,AVHRR,MODIS,"
"security in iot-enabled digital twins of maritime transportation systems","2023","The purposes are to explore the safety performance of the Maritime Transportation System (MTS) based on Digital Twins (DTs) Internet of Things (IoT) and develop maritime transportation towards intelligence and digitalization. Because the comprehensive operational security of modern MTS is not yet mature, historical transportation data of the Maritime Silk Road are acquired and preprocessed. Afterward, DTs are introduced, and relay nodes are added to data transmission paths to construct a maritime transportation DTs model based on relay cooperation IoT. Eventually, this modelâ€™s security performance is validated through simulation experiments. Relay security analysis suggests that interference information is a vital guarantee to assist in information non-disclosure, from which the constructed model can harvest energy to increase the data transmission power, thereby improving communication performance and secrecy rate. Outage probability analysis reveals that the simulated and the theoretical results are almost the same; moreover, given the systemâ€™s multi-hop paths in the same environment, the more the relays and the greater the fading index, the better the system performance and the lower the outage probability. Once the iterations reach a particular number, the node secrecy rate becomes optimal and cannot cause excessive burden to the system; besides, the power distribution can establish a new equilibrium when the nodes are in different locations, so that system security performance gets improved. The simulated value is closest to the actual result under 100% successful transmission probability and  $0.01\sim 0.05~\lambda $  value. To sum up, the constructed maritime transportation DTs model presents extraordinary transmission and security performance, providing an experimental basis for intelligent and secure maritime transportation in the future.","telecommunication network reliability,telecommunication security,telecommunication power management,Maritime Transportation System,Transportation,secure maritime transportation,historical transportation data,maritime transportation systems,Internet of Things,intelligent maritime transportation,Marine vehicles,maritime transportation DTs model,data transmission paths,relay nodes,IoT-enabled digital twins,Radio frequency,Maritime Silk Road,digital twins,comprehensive operational security,outage probability analysis,Relays,digitalization,relay cooperation IoT,node secrecy rate,communication performance,wireless channels,safety performance,relay security analysis,system performance,system security performance,cooperative communication,probability,Digital Twins Internet,data transmission power,Sensors,relay cooperation,Digital twins,Security,maritime transportation system,maritime silk road,"
"long-term life stress mapping algorithm of the deep-sea pressurized spherical shell based on digital-twin technology","2023","Aiming at the difficulty of the global stress field monitoring of the deep-sea pressurized spherical shell in real time, this paper proposes a long-term life stress field reverse mapping algorithm based on digital-twin technology. Specifically, a high-fidelity FEM model is established based on the titanium alloy data, structure construction data and model test data. The Elastic modulus E and Poisson's ratio υ are selected as the structure characteristic parameters based on the preliminary small sample test results. The sensitivity analysis is carried out. And then, stress monitoring location selection results is proposed considering the factors such as mutual independence, installation conditions, and economic costs. The Long-Short Term Memory network (LSTM) together with the FEM results is tailored and employed to build the reverse mapping model. The mapping error is below 1% and compared to the FEM model, the efficiency of the proposed model is improved by more than 60 times.","Global stress field,LSTM,Reverse mapping,FEM analysis,Digital twin,"

The proposed method is based on the representation of a ship's velocity with an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process and on the detection of changes of its long-run mean to identify navigational way-points. In order to assess the graph representativeness of the traffic, two performance metrics are introduced, leading to distinct graph construction criteria.

"a novel concept for a satellite-based maritime search and rescue system","1977","Search and rescue (SAR) for both airborne and maritime vehicles has been an area of intense investigation for many years. Current techniques include employment of small distress transmitters which provide signals that have only a limited interception capability. This can considerably increase the search time and reduce its effectiveness. With the increased availability-existing and planned-of both synchronous and nonsynchronous satellites, SAR investigations are being directed toward the application of satellites. The present paper introduces the concept of satellite-based maritime search and rescue system (SAMSARS). This is a proposed pseudonoise (PN) wide-band spread spectrum system that would operate at low power levels and coexist with operational communication satellite systems (voice or data) without mutual interference. The use of existing operational satellite spectrum, instead of a dedicated distress channel or special satellites, is a major feature of SAMSARS. Other important aspects are its capability of providing unique identification and distress information in minutes following activation of the distress transmitter and its inherent immunity to false alarms. SAMSARS can also provide position location directly when three satellites are mutually visible or indirectly, by taking advantage of a vessel's on-board derived navigation data. This paper presents concept elements such as message structure, transmitter and receiver block diagrams, and unique features of SAMSARS. The paper also presents an operational example, including sample link power budgets, and finally specifies areas for further investigation.","Frequency,Wideband,Radio transmitters,Radio position measurement,multiaccess,Costs,Interference,Spread spectrum communication,Satellite communication,Artificial satellites,Vehicles,Spread-spectrum communications,Satellite broadcasting,Pseudonoise-coded communication,Employment,Marine-vehicle communication,"
"single image defogging based on illumination decomposition for visual maritime surveillance","2019","Single image fog removal is important for surveillance applications, and, recently, many defogging methods have been proposed. Due to the adverse atmospheric conditions, the scattering properties of foggy images depend on not only the depth information of scene but also the atmospheric aerosol model, which has a more prominent influence on illumination in a fog scene than that in a haze scene. However, the recent defogging methods confuse haze and fog, and they fail to consider fully the scattering properties. Thus, these methods are not sufficient to remove fog effects, especially for images in maritime surveillance. Therefore, this paper proposes a single image defogging method for visual maritime surveillance. First, a comprehensive scattering model is proposed to formulate a fog image in the glow-shaped environmental illumination. Then, an illumination decomposition algorithm is proposed to eliminate the glow effect on the airlight radiance and recover a fog layer, in which the objects at the infinite distance have uniform luminance. Second, a transmission-map estimation based on the non-local haze-lines prior is utilized to constrain the transmission map into a reasonable range for the input fog image. Finally, the proposed illumination compensation algorithm enables the defogging image to preserve the natural illumination information of the input image. In addition, a fog image dataset is established for the visual maritime surveillance. The experimental results based on the established dataset demonstrate that the proposed method can outperform the state-of-the-art methods in terms of both the subjective and objective evaluation criteria. Moreover, the proposed method can effectively remove fog and maintain naturalness for fog images.","state-of-the-art methods,glow-shaped environmental illumination,illumination decomposition,Lighting,adverse atmospheric conditions,scattering properties,fog scene,fog image dataset,Image defogging,fog effects,image enhancement,single image fog removal,foggy images,haze-lines prior,image colour analysis,Meteorology,fog,illumination decomposition algorithm,natural illumination information,Atmospheric modeling,Scattering,illumination compensation algorithm,marine engineering,surveillance applications,brightness,Oceans,visual maritime surveillance,atmospheric aerosol model,defogging image,lighting,nonlocal haze-lines,haze scene,comprehensive scattering model,input fog image,fog layer,image restoration,Visualization,image sensors,Surveillance,aerosols,single image defogging method,"
"biologically inspired cooperative spectrum sensing scheme for maritime cognitive radio networks","2018","Spectrum sensing is imperative to the success of maritime cognitive radio networks (MCRNs). Spectrum sensing in MCRNs is challenging because of the sea surface movement, the channel interference, and the unstable link quality. Recent research reveals that existing spectrum sensing schemes work well for lower sea states; however, they have failed to perform effectively at higher sea states. There are two disadvantages of performing spectrum sensing at higher sea states: 1) low probability of detection may also cause interference with primary system and 2) energy wastage. In this paper, a biologically inspired cooperative spectrum sensing scheme (BIC3S) is proposed to deal with the reliability and energy consumption challenges associated with the sea environment. It is based on the task allocation model of an insect colony. The proposed BIC3S chooses participating secondary users for cooperative spectrum sensing according to their given sea state. Further, it enables the secondary users to decide whether or not to perform spectrum sensing based on their sea state. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed scheme in terms of energy consumption, detection performance, and throughput. It is shown that the proposed BIC3S consumes less energy and, at the same time, achieves higher detection probability and fewer probability of false alarms compared to the existing schemes. Moreover, BIC3S provides better adaptation capabilities for the sea environment.","telecommunication network reliability,cooperative detection,cognitive radio,BIC3S,Cognitive radio network,maritime cognitive radio networks,Marine vehicles,channel interference,energy wastage,radio spectrum management,Wireless communication,task allocation model,higher sea states,unstable link quality,detection probability,low probability-of-detection,sea surface movement,sea environment,biologically inspired cooperative spectrum sensing scheme,Entropy,Sea state,radio networks,maritime communication,detection performance,Biology,insect colony,cooperative communication,signal detection,probability,energy consumption,marine communication,MCRN,spectrum sensing,Detectors,"

"the shallow salinity minima of the pacific ocean","1973","From the high latitudes of the Pacific Ocean, where surface salinity is low, two shallow subsurface salinity minima extend equatorward along the eastern boundary currents and turn westward with the Trade Wind Drift. The density at the source is such that the waters sink beneath the lower-density, more saline waters within the subtropical anticyclonic gyres and the intertropical zones. The shallow minima are relatively minor features within the intertropical zones and lie beneath the high-salinity layers extending from the high-salinity cells of the anticyclones and above the major salinity minima of the Intermediate Water. Vertical mixing eventually eliminates the shallow minima, but only after some thousands of kilometers of flow. Because the high-salinity cell of the North Pacific is at a higher latitude than that in the South Pacific, the northern minimum can extend farther west (to the Philippine Islands) in the intertropical zone; the southern minimum extends (along 15°S) only to about 160°W. Both summer and winter maps of characteristics along an isanostere that lies near the minima have been prepared, and they indicate that in the western Pacific both the North Equatorial Counter-current and the South Equatorial Countercurrent shift northward in winter.",""
"fog node discovery and selection: a systematic literature review","2022","Fog computing is a new computing paradigm that extends cloud services by providing computing resources in the form of fog nodes closer to the edge devices. Fog computing supports mobility, location-awareness, low latency, and saves network bandwidth to efficiently process and store the data generated by edge devices.

To achieve these aims, there are various selection criteria that need to be satisfied. The aim of this study is to provide a detailed overview of the state of the art in the area of fog node discovery and selection. To achieve this aim, we first define the different requirements that need to be met in identifying optimal fog nodes.

"coastal engineering applications of high-resolution lidar bathymetry","1998","In 1994, the US Army Corps of Engineers completed development of the Scanning Hydrographic Operational Airborne Lidar Survey (SHOALS) system, a state-of-the-art hydrographic survey instrument. Using lidar (Light Detection And Ranging) technology and operating from a Bell 212 helicopter, SHOALS remotely collects accurate, high-resolution bathymetry at a rate of 8 km2/h. A nominal depth-and-position measurement spacing of 4 m yields high-density bottom coverage of coastal projects, producing soundings from the above-water beach, or coastal structure, to depths of 40 m. Since becoming fully operational, SHOALS surveyed over 2000 km2 along the Atlantic Ocean, Pacific Ocean, Gulf of Mexico, Great Lakes, and Caribbean Sea. Survey projects varied from tidal inlets and navigation channels to beach nourishment and monitoring. These projects quantify current coastal structure condition, navigation channel alignments, and morphologic changes over time. In addition to monitoring coastal projects, sediment transport can be estimated with accurate, high-resolution bathymetry. Bathymetry can be translated into sediment transport through a combination of the sediment continuity equation, a surf zone energetics-based longshore transport formula, and bathymetric data. This paper presents the SHOALS system describing both lidar technology and the survey system. Several SHOALS data sets are presented to show today's benefits of high-resolution lidar bathymetry to the coastal engineering community. Finally, ongoing research using these unique data sets is presented to show the future benefits of lidar bathymetry to the coastal field.","Bathymetry,Sediment transport,Scanning Hydrographic Operational Airborne Lidar Survey system,"

"ree distribution and nd isotope composition of estuarine waters and bulk sediment leachates tracing lithogenic inputs in eastern canada","2019","The rare earth element (REE) concentrations and the neodymium (Nd) and strontium (Sr) isotope compositions of the detrital fraction and authigenic FeMn oxyhydroxide coatings of marine sediments may provide valuable information for better understanding the pathways of weathering inputs and estuarine and coastal exchange processes on different time scales. Here, we present the REE concentrations and 143Nd/144Nd (expressed in epsilon units, εNd) and 87Sr/86Sr ratios of detrital and authigenic (leached FeMn oxyhydroxides) fractions from sediment core-top samples and of estuarine water samples collected in the Estuary and Gulf of St. Lawrence (EGSL) and continental shelf off southeastern Canada. The REE distribution patterns, εNd values, and 87Sr/86Sr isotopic values from the detrital fraction allow for the discrimination of sediment from continental sources in the EGSL. Sediments in the Baie des Chaleurs and on the continental shelf, which have εNd values ranging from −14.3 to −16, 87Sr/86Sr values ranging from 0.72708 to 0.71475, and low La/Yb and Gd/Yb ratios, are mainly supplied by the early Paleozoic Appalachian Mountains. In contrast, sediments in the Laurentian and Esquiman channels (εNd = −18.7 to −21.8, 87Sr/86Sr = 0.72068 to 0.72607, and high La/Yb and Gd/Yb ratios) come from the Grenvillian metamorphic rocks in the Canadian Shield, and surface sediments on the southern Labrador Shelf (εNd = −28.7, 87Sr/86Sr = 0.73062, and high La/Yb and Gd/Yb ratios) mainly originate from the Hudson Strait and Baffin Bay. The εNd values obtained from estuarine water samples and bulk sediment leachates are unradiogenic, with values ranging between −18.9 and − 21.7 and between −16.1 and − 27.2, respectively. Based on these results and the dissolved REE concentrations, we speculate that salt-induced coagulation of colloidal matter, dissolution of lithogenic sediments from the adjacent continents (notably from the erosion of the Grenville Province on the North Shore), bottom scavenging within the nepheloid layer, and brine rejection during sea ice formation significantly influence the distribution of REEs and the authigenic εNd signal throughout the water column in the EGSL. Overall, our results both underscore the fact that caution must be exercised when interpreting authigenic εNd records due to bottom water-mass mixing in estuarine and coastal marine environments and highlight the potential of REE and NdSr isotope compositions in investigating changes in sediment sources and transport pathways in the EGSL.","Neodymium isotopes,Estuarine processes,Strontium isotopes,Sediment provenance,Estuary and gulf of St. Lawrence,Rare earth element,Particle scavenging,"
"assessment of offshore oil/gas platform status in the northern gulf of mexico using multi-source satellite time-series images","2018","Accurate knowledge of the detailed status (location and lifetime) of each oil/gas platform is crucial for ocean management and for understanding its potential environmental impact. However, this requirement is often compromised due to incomplete data records, especially when platform abandonment is not properly planned, designed, and/or executed. The availability of multi-source optical and SAR images provides the possibility of a systematic assessment, but the ubiquitous false positives and frequent geocoding errors make it technically challenging. Here, we develop a time-series remote sensing approach (TSRS) for detecting offshore platforms and determining their status, where the technical challenges are overcome using two strategies, as follows: (i) A stepwise optimization strategy applied to individual images and time-series images to mitigate numerous noises, to select platforms from candidates, and to assess platform status; and (ii) A cross geo-correction strategy using platforms derived from high-geometric accuracy images as ground control points to rectify poorly geo-referenced images. We applied the TSRS approach to the northern Gulf of Mexico using about 26,000 moderate-resolution optical/SAR images from eight satellites spanning the period from 1982 to 2017. TSRS detected a total of 9260 (5556) platforms in both Federal and State waters, including 3140 (1803) existing platforms, 5044 (3426) removed platforms, and 1076 (327) status-to-be-determined platforms where the numbers in parentheses represent those from Federal waters. Of these TSRS platforms, 4751 coincide spatially with 5476 (77.68%) of platform records of the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) platform database; 2846 (387 in Federal waters) are not found in the BSEE platform database but are convincingly supported by data from other sources (including BSEE-pipeline-database, time-series VIIRS nighttime light products, and littoral ground-truth images), meaning that 82.04% of the TSRS-derived platforms can be directly/indirectly confirmed. A site-specific validation in East Bay using multi-temporal ground-truth aerial images indicates that, for this site, the false negative rate (FNR) is ~9.63% and the false positive rate (FPR) is only 4.44%. The detailed beginning/end dates of the TSRS platforms are mostly confirmed by the corresponding Installation/Site-clear dates recorded in the BSEE platform database. Our findings suggest that the TSRS approach is a robust and cost-effective way to assess oil/gas platform status in large regions, and our results here may complement the official database, narrow down locations for future field investigations, and provide critical information for future assessment of the potential impacts of active and decommissioned platforms on the marine environments.","Landsat,Northern Gulf of Mexico,Offshore platform,Platform status assessment,Remote sensing,SAR,Time-series,"
"origin and depositional history of platinum-group minerals in placers – a critical review of facts and fiction","2022","The present work reviews assemblages of detrital platinum-group minerals (PGM) in placers worldwide with the aim of identifying common and distinctive features related to their depositional history from primary host rocks via weathering into the placers. Special attention is given to the endogenic destruction of primary PGM and the possible formation of PGM from solution under ambient conditions. The dominant PGMs of economic interest occurring in eluvial and alluvial deposits are Pt-Fe alloys and Os-Ir-Ru alloys. Major current and past producing areas are in Russia (Urals, Koryak-Kamchatka, and Aldan Shield areas), Colombia (Chocó area), Canada (Tulameen area), and the USA (Goodnews Bay). The PGE alloys in all these areas have been sourced from zoned mafic/ultramafic Alaskan-Uralian-type intrusions whereby erosion and weathering of enormous volumes of rock resulted in the concentration of the sparsely disseminated alloys. Subeconomic placers in ophiolite terranes such as in Burma (Chindwin area), Papua New Guinea (Aikora river), and the Philippines (Samar Island) are dominated by Os-Ir-Ru alloys. Minor deposits from the Yubdo area (Ethiopia) and the Freetown Layered Complex (Sierra Leone) have been the subject of many studies to prove or disprove authigenic growth of Pt-Fe alloys and other minerals. To scientifically evaluate the genesis of these minerals, we discuss their mineralogy, silicate and sulfide inclusions, isotopic data, and grain sizes, together with the role of weathering, climate, aqueous geochemistry, and biological activity in their formation. Other deposits and relevant platinum-group element (PGE) mineralization are also examined, including the Bushveld deposits (South Africa), Great Dyke (Zimbabwe), Córrego Bom Sucesso (Brazil), Dominican Republic, Rhine River (Germany), and the Witwatersrand paleoplacers (South Africa). No evidence was found for the growth of distinct PGM larger than about 1–5 µm in the surficial environment. The reactivity of the different PGM varies in relation to their mineral chemistry and depends on local environmental conditions (Eh, pH, temperature, solutes) and is possibly aided by bacterial activity. The order of decreasing stability in the supergene environment is: (1) very stable: Pt–Fe alloys, Os-Ir alloys and Os-rich laurite/erlichmanite → (2) stable: sperrylite → (3) variably stable/“meta-stable”: cooperite/braggite → (4) unstable: PGE-(bismutho-) tellurides and PGE-sulfarsenides. Nano- to micrometer-sized grains or small crystallites of authigenic PGM are different to the more common and significant resistate PGM and consist of native platinum and Pt-Pd alloys with ≈< 5 at. % Fe, or Pt-Fe-Ni-rich alloys, predominantly sited on precursor PGM or locked in small veins or in chromite. Under some conditions, microorganisms may play a role in the destruction of primary PGM but have not been proven to form authigenic PGM. It is concluded that grains or nuggets of Pt-Fe alloys in placers are always allogenic constituents and originate from primary magmatic mineralization, as is also the case for Ru-Os-Ir alloys, laurite-erlichmanite and sperrylite grains. Growth of larger millimeter-size crystals or nuggets has never been observed under ambient conditions and proof of PGM “neoformation” to any significant degree is lacking. The missing link, a look into the cradle of PGM creation in the supergene environment, remains outstanding.","Placers,Mineralogy,Origin and depositional history,Os isotopes,Pt-Fe alloys,Platinum-group minerals,"

"risk models for maritime security, area and port force protection","2010","Asymmetric and terrorist threats stand as perhaps one of the greatest threats to maritime forces at present. Accordingly, there has been an increase in the study of problems related to this threat in the defense community. This report discusses models related to maritime security, area and port force protection. The primary focus is the discussion of an area force protection model designed to consider the situation where an escorted vessel traveling through constrained waters comes under attack by a fast, small boat. A method where discrete bursts of gunfire are averaged over time to provide an effectiveness model is presented and used to identify the likelihood of defending against such an attacker. The approach is also used to identify the effects of ship maneuvers and augmentation teams in improving the probability of a positive outcome. Three other models that examine port scenarios are presented. The first is based on the same methodologies as the area force protection model and gives a measure of the ability to neutralize an incoming threat by a shore-based or moored defender.

"butyltins concentration levels and imposex occurrence in snails from the sicilian coasts (italy)","2003","Two sampling campaigns have been carried out along the Sicilian coasts within the frame of a European project (Hic-TBT) financed by the LIFE programme. Snails and sediments have been sampled at 5 stations, characterised by very low (Ustica natural sea reserve), low (Ustica harbour), intermediate (Castellamare and Termini Imerese) and high shipping densities (Palermo). Biological and chemical analyses were carried out in order to evaluate the incidence of imposex occurring in snails, and the concentration levels of organotins in sediment and snail samples. Despite the low organotin concentration levels in sediment and snail samples, the results show that imposex is widespread around Sicily. In four locations almost all female snails were affected by imposex at advanced development stages, even in areas with a fairly low shipping density. Only in the natural sea reserve of Ustica Island imposex was relatively less severe. Finally a logarithmic correlation between TBT and imposex stages was observed.","Mediterranean Sea,Sediments,Antifouling paints,Gastropods,Tributyltin,"
"marine vehicle tracking using agile maritime iots","2021","Marine surveillance deals with the complex problem of modeling and estimating natural and human processes while operating with limited information acquisition resources. The complexity of the problem and the scarcity of resources, such as power, processing, and communications, requires agile distributed sensing and computing that provides scalability, diversity in information acquisition, and adaptive allocation of limited resources. This work deals with tracking multiple marine vehicles using data from heterogeneous sensors. Accurate tracking is achieved by a synergy between a network of agile maritime IoTs, with limited processing resources, and a fusion center, with computationally intensive capability. The IoTs can reconfigure their elementary processing operations settings to produce informative yet low volume measurement statistics. The fusion center handles heterogeneous data fusion and solves the complex problem of vehicle state estimation. We demonstrate that by configuring its agile distributed computing capabilities, the proposed system provides significant savings in processing and communications resources without deteriorating tracking performance.","Edge Computing,agile maritime IoTs,Neural Networks,sensor fusion,fusion center,Sequential Monte Carlo,human processes,Internet of Things,heterogeneous data fusion,agile distributed sensing,low volume measurement statistics,marine vehicle tracking,heterogeneous sensors,computationally intensive capability,agile distributed computing capabilities,vehicle state estimation,Robot sensing systems,adaptive allocation,complex problem,wireless sensor networks,Target tracking,state estimation,Volume measurement,Radar tracking,Scalability,information acquisition resources,communications resources,marine surveillance deals,Machine Learning,multiple marine vehicles,Sensors,tracking performance,Surveillance,elementary processing operations settings,marine vehicles,resource allocation,"
"spring and summer extreme temperatures in iberia during last century in relation to circulation types","2013","In the Iberian Peninsula the raise of temperatures has been notable from mid-1970s to mid-2000s, especially in spring and summer. This study analyses spatial and temporal relationships between extreme temperatures and atmospheric circulation types (CTs) defined over the Iberian Peninsula (IP) in these seasons. Station series (29) of maximum and minimum temperature are considered, starting from 1905 until 2006. The CTs (9 for spring and 8 for summer) are derived by a cluster method applied to daily mean SLP grids covering the period 1850–2003. Changes in the seasonal frequency of extreme temperatures and of CTs are analysed. Subsequently, the CTs are examined for their effectiveness in leading to moderately extreme temperatures (at each location) using an index that measures the contribution to extreme days with respect to the contribution to non-extreme days. Correlation between regional extreme series and CTs frequency is also tested. In spring, the decrease in cold nights, which is notable in the 1970s onwards, can be partially attributable to a downtrend in the frequency of Northerly flow. High frequency of Anticyclone in North Iberia in the 1980s and 1990s has contributed to an increase in warm days in West and North stations. To the SE quadrant of the IP, a great part of warm days is related to south-westerly flow, (both) presenting a higher frequency in the 1950s and the 1960s. In summer warm nights increased remarkably to the SE and SW, and may be in part related to uptrends in Iberian thermal low pattern (1950–2003) and North Atlantic Anticyclone (1850–2003) respectively. Warm days have increased remarkably to the NE especially in the 1990s and 2000s, but this is not found to be related to changes in CTs' frequency. Furthermore, the existence of within type changes (variations in Tmax, Tmin and extreme indices within the CTs) points to the identification of other physical factors operating on inter-annual to multidecadal time scales. Thus, the consideration of Sea Surface Temperature (SST) of the East Atlantic Ocean and Iberian soil moisture conditions (by means of a drought index) helps to explain the evolution of extreme temperatures.","Sea level pressure,Within-type changes,Circulation types,Spring and summer warming,Iberian extreme temperatures,"
"lightning climatology over the northwest pacific region: an 11-year study using data from the world wide lightning location network","2018","Lightning data from the World Wide Lightning Location Network for the period 2005–2015 were used to investigate climatic characteristics of lightning activity over the northwest Pacific region (0°–55°N, 100°–180°E). The highest lightning densities (LDs) were observed over the coastal areas of southeast Asia and the tropical islands, which differs significantly from the distribution of the highest precipitation rates. The LD in the South China Sea (SCS) was much higher than that over the deep ocean and showed a peak that was 3 h ahead of that seen in the open sea. A sharp increase in LD on the Indo-China Peninsula and in the SCS was observed during the pre-monsoon season. The monthly variations show that the highest lightning activity occurred during July, August, and September, which is consistent with the variations in the monthly precipitation rate. The contribution of tropical cyclones (TCs) and the impact of El Nino and La Nina events on lightning climatology over the northwest Pacific region were also examined. Two areas of maximum TC lightning were observed to the east of the Philippines and south of China, indicating that frequent lightning is produced when TCs are approaching landfall. The average LD during El Nino events increases by 10.3%, whereas during La Nina events it decreases by 4.8%. A northward shift in the positive lightning anomaly was observed in the SCS, from the southern SCS during the El Nino to the central and northern SCS during the La Nina periods.","ENSO,Northwest Pacific,Lightning climatology,WWLLN,Tropical cyclone,"

"habitat suitability of the atlantic bluefin tuna by size class: an ecological niche approach","2016","An ecological niche modelling (ENM) approach was used to predict the potential feeding and spawning habitats of small (5–25kg, only feeding) and large (>25kg) Atlantic bluefin tuna (ABFT), Thunnus thynnus, in the Mediterranean Sea, the North Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico. The ENM was built bridging knowledge on ecological traits of ABFT (e.g. temperature tolerance, mobility, feeding and spawning strategy) with patterns of selected environmental variables (chlorophyll-a fronts and concentration, sea surface current and temperature, sea surface height anomaly) that were identified using an extensive set of precisely geo-located presence data. The results highlight a wider temperature tolerance for larger fish allowing them to feed in the northern – high chlorophyll levels – latitudes up to the Norwegian Sea in the eastern Atlantic and to the Gulf of Saint Lawrence in the western basin. Permanent suitable feeding habitat for small ABFT was predicted to be mostly located in temperate latitudes in the North Atlantic and in the Mediterranean Sea, as well as in subtropical waters off north-west Africa, while summer potential habitat in the Gulf of Mexico was found to be unsuitable for both small and large ABFTs. Potential spawning grounds were found to occur in the Gulf of Mexico from March–April in the south-east to April–May in the north, while favourable conditions evolve in the Mediterranean Sea from mid-May in the eastern to mid-July in the western basin. Other secondary potential spawning grounds not supported by observations were predicted in the Azores area and off Morocco to Senegal during July and August when extrapolating the model settings from the Gulf of Mexico into the North Atlantic. The presence of large ABFT off Florida and the Bahamas in spring was not explained by the model as is, however the environmental variables other than the sea surface height anomaly appeared to be favourable for spawning in part of this area. Defining key spatial and temporal habitats should further help in building spatially-explicit stock assessment models, thus improving the spatial management of bluefin tuna fisheries.",""
"noma-based hybrid satellite-uav-terrestrial networks for 6g maritime coverage","2023","Current fifth-generation (5G) networks do not cover maritime areas, causing difficulties in developing maritime Internet of Things (IoT). To tackle this problem, we establish a nearshore network by collaboratively using on-shore terrestrial base stations (TBSs) and tethered unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). These TBSs and UAVs form virtual clusters in a user-centric manner. Within each virtual cluster, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is adopted for agilely including various maritime IoT devices, which are sparsely distributed over the vast ocean. The nearshore network also shares the spectrum with marine satellites. In such a NOMA-based hybrid satellite-UAV-terrestrial network, interference among different network segments, different clusters, and different users occurs. We thereby formulate a joint power allocation problem to maximize the sum rate of the network. Different from existing studies, we use large-scale channel state information (CSI) only for optimization to reduce system overhead. The large-scale CSI is obtained by using the position information of maritime IoT devices. The problem is non-convex with intractable non-linear constraints. We tackle these difficulties by adopting max-min optimization, the auxiliary function method, and the successive convex approximation technique. An iterative power allocation algorithm is accordingly proposed, which is shown to be effective for coverage enhancement by simulations. This shows the potential of NOMA-based hybrid satellite-UAV-terrestrial networks for maritime on-demand coverage.","Satellites,array signal processing,6G maritime coverage,nonorthogonal multiple access,remotely operated vehicles,Internet of Things,joint power allocation problem,maritime IoT devices,convex programming,Marine vehicles,non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA),virtual cluster,Resource management,NOMA-based hybrid satellite-UAV-terrestrial networks,interference,concave programming,maritime Internet,NOMA,minimax techniques,power allocation,marine satellites,optimisation,tethered unmanned aerial vehicles,maritime on-demand coverage,maritime areas,maritime Internet of Things,user-centric manner,satellite-UAV-terrestrial network,radiofrequency interference,iterative methods,autonomous aerial vehicles,on-shore terrestrial base stations,TBSs,nearshore network,nonlinear programming,multi-access systems,Interference,different network segments,MIMO communication,approximation theory,resource allocation,Precoding,UAVs,Hybrid satellite-UAV-terrestrial network,"

"contextual verification for false alarm reduction in maritime anomaly detection","2015","Automated vessel anomaly detection is immensely important for preventing and reducing illegal activities (e.g., drug dealing, human trafficking, etc.) and for effective emergency response and rescue in a country's territorial waters. A major limitation of previously proposed vessel anomaly detection techniques is the high rate of false alarms as these methods mainly consider vessel kinematic information which is generally obtained from AIS data. In many cases, an anomalous vessel in terms of kinematic data can be completely normal and legitimate if the 'context' at the location and time (e.g., weather and sea conditions) of the vessel is factored in. In this paper, we propose a novel anomalous vessel detection framework that utilizes such contextual information to reduce false alarms through 'contextual verification'. We evaluate our proposed framework for vessel anomaly detection using massive amount of real-life AIS data sets obtained from U.S. Coast Guard. Though our study and developed prototype is based on the maritime domain the basic idea of using contextual information through 'contextual verification' to filter false alarms can be applied to other domains as well.","Kinematics,AIS Data,emergency management,vessel kinematic information,Contextual Verification,Trajectory Clustering,Anomaly Detection,contextual verification,US coast guard,Meteorology,False Alarm Reduction,illegal activities,marine engineering,automated vessel anomaly detection,false alarms,Big data,contextual information,Context,false alarm reduction,maritime anomaly detection,Real-time systems,emergency response,Tracking,Trajectory,territorial waters,AIS data,"
"study of the río de la plata turbidity front, part 1: spatial and temporal distribution","1996","The Río de la Plata is a riverine system located on the east coast of South America at 35°S. It covers 35,000 km2, it is 320 km long and 230 km wide at the mouth. The Río de la Plata drains the second largest basin in South America with an average discharge of 22,000 m3 s−1. The processes associated with the interaction of the fresh river water and the saline shelf water and tidal stirring generate a turbidity front in the outer region, which is clearly defined in the satellite images as a strong gradient in reflectance and a sharp change in water color. We use a 4 yr span of NOAA-AVHRR daily images, from September 1986 to August 1990, to determine the spatial and temporal distribution of the turbidity front. Channels 1 and 2 (visible and near-infrared) are used to digitize the fronts, and channel 4 and sea surface temperature are used as complementary information for cloud detection. From a total of 2578 images, 1274 daytime images allowed us to determine 333 positions of the front. This information is used to estimate the distribution of the frontal density, a probabilistic measure of frontal occurrence. Monthly, seasonal and annual analyses were performed. The relation of the turbidity front patterns to bathymetry, tidal dynamics, river discharge and winds were investigated. A comparison between the frontal density distribution and stratification parameters is presented. The results show a high degree of variability of the frontal distribution at the northern coast of the estuary. In this region, the frontal position varies between 57°W and 54°12′W. The westernmost location occurs in the summer months, which is coincident with minimum river discharge, predominance of easterly winds and minimum occurrence of southwesterlies. The easternmost location occurs during the spring, with strong winds from the southwest. At the southern coast the modal position of the front coincides with the 5 m isobath, although great variations to this position have been observed during years of large river discharge. The fall and winter are seasons of maximum river discharge. During these periods there is a bimodal frontal distribution with maximum values of frontal density at the northern area of Bay of Samborombón and south of Montevideo, and higher variability in the center of the river.",""

The decision that has to be taken is either declaring that a deviation happened or not, relying only upon two consecutive AIS contacts.

"uav-enabled accompanying coverage for hybrid satellite-uav-terrestrial maritime communications","2019","Despite of constantly-developing satellites and terrestrial fifth generation (5G) communications, there is still a large gap for maritime broadband coverage. In this paper, we explore the potential gain of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for maritime communications. A hybrid satellite-UAV-terrestrial network is considered, where the UAV is employed to offer an accompanying coverage for mobile ships. We optimize both the trajectory and transmit power of UAV to maximize the minimum of ship's achievable rate. Different from previous studies, we consider a typical composite channel model containing both large-scale and small-scale fading, to cope with the practical propagation environment. Moreover, we assume only the large-scale channel state information (CSI) is known for optimization, because the dynamic small-scale fading cannot be obtained before UAV's flight, whereas the large-scale CSI can be estimated according to the position information of ships. Under this context, an optimization problem is formulated, subject to constraints on UAV's kinematics and communication limitation. We solve the problem which is proved to be non-convex by problem decomposition, successive convex optimization and bisection searching tools. Simulation results have corroborated the superiority of the proposed accompanying coverage of UAV.","Satellites,unmanned aerial vehicles,UAV flight,composite channel model,large-scale CSI,convex programming,Marine vehicles,Wireless communication,concave programming,5G mobile communication,ships,large-scale channel state information,communication limitation,dynamic small-scale fading,satellite-UAV-terrestrial network,wireless channels,autonomous aerial vehicles,satellites,Optimization,Unmanned aerial vehicles,Trajectory,terrestrial fifth generation communications,marine communication,hybrid satellite-UAV-terrestrial maritime communications,maritime broadband coverage,mobile ships,Interference,MIMO communication,fading channels,"
"ship collision avoidance behaviour recognition and analysis based on ais data","2022","A novel approach is proposed to automatically identify the ship collision avoidance behaviour from ship trajectories based on an improved Sliding Window Algorithm. The approach has three main stages: (1) determining the ships’ obligations according to the Convention on the International Regulations for Preventing Collision at Sea (COLREGs); (2) assessing the rudder angle according to the true bearing of the target ship; (3) identifying the corresponding ship handling behaviour from the ship trajectory taking into account the Rate of Turn and its derivative based on the Sliding Window Algorithm. Four typical encounter scenarios are studied to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method. The approach is then applied to near collision scenarios identified in the maritime traffic off the continental coast of Portugal, which allowed the characterization of the relative and spatial distributions of the locations at which the ships take evasive manoeuvres. The results show that the approach can be applied to accurately detect the ship collision avoidance behaviour from Automatic Identification System trajectory data, and the characterization of the collision avoidance behaviour can potentially be used by situational awareness systems and as the basis for ship collision avoidance decision-making.","Ship evasive manoeuvring,Near collision scenario,Collision avoidance,Sliding window Algorithm,"
"variability and change in the west antarctic peninsula marine system: research priorities and opportunities","2019","The west Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) region has undergone significant changes in temperature and seasonal ice dynamics since the mid-twentieth century, with strong impacts on the regional ecosystem, ocean chemistry and hydrographic properties. Changes to these long-term trends of warming and sea ice decline have been observed in the 21st century, but their consequences for ocean physics, chemistry and the ecology of the high-productivity shelf ecosystem are yet to be fully established. The WAP shelf is important for regional krill stocks and higher trophic levels, whilst the degree of variability and change in the physical environment and documented biological and biogeochemical responses make this a model system for how climate and sea ice changes might restructure high-latitude ecosystems. Although this region is arguably the best-measured and best-understood shelf region around Antarctica, significant gaps remain in spatial and temporal data capable of resolving the atmosphere-ice-ocean-ecosystem feedbacks that control the dynamics and evolution of this complex polar system. Here we summarise the current state of knowledge regarding the key mechanisms and interactions regulating the physical, biogeochemical and biological processes at work, the ways in which the shelf environment is changing, and the ecosystem response to the changes underway. We outline the overarching cross-disciplinary priorities for future research, as well as the most important discipline-specific objectives. Underpinning these priorities and objectives is the need to better define the causes, magnitude and timescales of variability and change at all levels of the system. A combination of traditional and innovative approaches will be critical to addressing these priorities and developing a co-ordinated observing system for the WAP shelf, which is required to detect and elucidate change into the future.","Primary production,Physical oceanography,Southern Ocean,Ecosystems,Sea ice,Nutrient and carbon cycling,Antarctica,Climate change,West Antarctic Peninsula,"

"synthetic trajectory extraction for maritime anomaly detection","2018","In the maritime domain, the main goal for large vessels is to drive as fast and efficiently as possible from one harbour to the next. This results in vessels following quite distinct routes. Deviations from these routes can be seen as indicators for illegal or at least suspicious behaviour. In order to extract these routes, clustering algorithms can be used, that will store the traffic patterns as synthetic trajectories. A vessel can be assigned to a specific route or a deviation from the routes can be detected by evaluating these route models. A challenge in designing the synthetic trajectories lies in the faithful representation, sparsity of data, treatment of outliers and split-up of routes. Here, a novel approach to model the uncertainty of the vessels movements while following a route is introduced: A cluster is now represented by a trajectory consisting of segments. Due to obstacles like shallow waters, a route might split up which will generate sub-segments. Instead of storing all cluster points, the position, speed, and course of the vessels are attached to each segment in form of normal distributions. Using these attributes, the probability of a deviation from the given trajectory can be estimated.","Clustering algorithms,Kernel,vessels movements,Anomaly detection,anomaly detection,traffic patterns,security of data,trajectory representation,ships,clustering algorithms,marine engineering,maritime domain,Heating systems,route models,pattern clustering,Artificial intelligence,maritime anomaly detection,synthetic trajectory extraction,Trajectory,data sparsity,probability,Gaussian distribution,data handling,"

"geospatial data analysis for global maritime risk assessment using the discrete global grid system","2021","The effective management of the safety of navigation by coastguards is challenged by the complexity in quantifying and describing the relative risk of accidents occurrence. The discovery of patterns in observation data is reliant on the collection and analysis of significant volumes of relevant heterogenous spatial datasets. Conventional approaches of risk mapping which aggregate vessel traffic and incident data into Cartesian grids can result in misrepresentation due to inherent inadequacies in this spatial data format. In this paper, we explore how the Discrete Global Grid System (DGGS) overcomes these limitations through the development of global maps of incident rates at multiple resolutions. The results demonstrate hot spots of relative high risk across different regions and clearly show that DGGS is more suited to global analysis than conventional grids. This work contributes to a greater understanding of both the disposition of maritime risk and the advantages of adopting DGGS in supporting big data analysis.","Risk management,Discrete Global Grid System,Safety,Navigation,Geospatial analysis,Spatial databases,Big Data,Maritime Risk,Automatic Identification System,Graphical models,Planning,"

Association of the circulation patterns to the local climate is investigated using observed daily temperature and rainfall data at 27 locations over Saudi Arabia for the period 1979–2010. Using the widely-used mathematical technique principal component analysis (PCA) we determine with MSLP data the principal patterns. We only analyse data for the wet season (October–May). The automated typing procedure establishes 12 circulation types, which represent all the main synoptic features especially those that originate from the Mediterranean, the European and African continents, Siberia, and also the Red and Arabian seas. There is a strong link between the circulation types and surface climate that is synoptically and spatially interpretable. Particular circulation types are associated with specific climatic conditions across the country: rainfall is linked with Types 9, 10 and 11, whilst warm days (nights) with 1, 2, 3, 9, 10, 11 and 12 (1, 2, 3, 10, 11 and 12), and cold days (nights) with 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 11 and 12 (2, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8).

"a novel meris algorithm to derive cyanobacterial phycocyanin pigment concentrations in a eutrophic lake: theoretical basis and practical considerations","2014","A novel algorithm is developed and validated to estimate phycocyanin (PC) pigment concentrations of the most common cyanobaterium, Microcystis aeruginosa, in Taihu Lake (China's third largest freshwater lake) using data from the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS). First, a PC index (PCI) is defined as remote-sensing reflectance (Rrs, sr−1) at 620nm normalized against a baseline formed linearly between Rrs(560) and Rrs(665). Because PC has a local absorption peak at ~620nm, PCI is shown in both theory and model simulations to exhibit a monotonic functional relationship with PC concentration. Field measurements also support this hypothesis, from which an empirical algorithm is developed to estimate PC concentrations between ~1 and 300μg/L with unbiased RMS uncertainties of 58%. Radiative transfer simulations further show that such a field-based algorithm can be applied directly to MERIS Rayleigh-corrected reflectance (Rrc) after adjusting algorithm coefficients. Spectral analyses and image comparisons indicate that such an algorithm is nearly immune to perturbations from thick aerosols, thin clouds, significant sun glint, and extreme water turbidity. Mean usable data coverage increases from <1% to >50% when using Rrc as compared to Rrs processed using standard atmospheric correction algorithms in SeaDAS. The robust algorithm performance and significantly improved data coverage lead to the establishment of a long-term (2002–2012) time-series of PC concentrations in Taihu Lake, which show both seasonal and inter-annual changes. Test of the algorithm over other lakes, including Dianchi Lake (a typical plateau lake of China), suggests that the same band-subtraction approach might be applicable to other inland water bodies, although local bio-optical conditions due to different sediment and phytoplankton compositions need to be considered when applying such an empirical approach.","Aerosols,MERIS,Phycocyanin,Remote sensing,Lake Taihu,Sun glint,Clouds,Chlorophyll-a,"

Each float manages a suite of commercially available sensors to collect environmental data such as sea surface temperature, sea state, and location as well as activity data about vessels and marine mammals moving across the ocean. The floats periodically transmit processed data, or immediately report events based on internal prioritization schemes. Messages travel via commercial satellite to a government cloud for storage and real-time analysis. Cloud-based data analytics feature machine learning aimed at discovering emergent features and behaviors from sparse data. The multiple performers manufacturing floats and developing software are being led by a government management team to employ commercial design methodology and agile best practices. At-sea float deployments are planned in two phases over 2019 (1-month) and 2020 (3-month). Program benefits include ocean environmental products derived from high-density, in-situ measurements and analytical applications, which can simultaneously provide users a range of outputs to include ocean circulation prediction, vessel and marine mammal tracking, and dynamic ocean resource management.","ocean areas,internal prioritization schemes,IoT,ocean temperature,commercial satellite,marine mammal tracking,persistent maritime situational awareness,cloud-based data analytics,Things program,Temperature measurement,cloud,drifters,DARPA's Ocean,Sea measurements,computerised monitoring,data acquisition,Data analysis,oceanography,intelligent floats,maritime situational awareness,vessel tracking,environmental data,target tracking,ocean circulation prediction,data analysis,OoT,oceanographic equipment,sea surface temperature,cloud computing,marine mammals,distributed sensors,ocean circulation,machine learning,wireless sensor networks,Oceans,real-time analysis,distributed sensor network,government management team,sparse data,government cloud,Cloud computing,marine communication,ocean environmental products,scalable analysis,Temperature sensors,Internet,dynamic ocean resource management,learning (artificial intelligence),affordable maritime sensors,sea state,floats,oceanographic techniques,"
"maritime pattern extraction from ais data using a genetic algorithm","2016","The long term prediction of maritime vessels' destinations and arrival times is essential for making an effective logistics planning. As ships are influenced by various factors over a long period of time, the solution cannot be achieved by analyzing sailing patterns of each entity separately. Instead, an approach is required, that can extract maritime patterns for the area in question and represent it in a form suitable for querying all possible routes any vessel in that region can take. To tackle this problem we use a genetic algorithm (GA) to cluster vessel position data obtained from the publicly available Automatic Identification System (AIS). The resulting clusters are treated as route waypoints (WP), and by connecting them we get nodes and edges of a directed graph depicting maritime patterns. Since standard clustering algorithms have difficulties in handling data with varying density, and genetic algorithms are slow when handling large data volumes, in this paper we investigate how to enhance the genetic algorithm to allow fast and accurate waypoint identification. We also include a quad tree structure to preprocess data and reduce the input for the GA. When the route graph is created, we add post processing to remove inconsistencies caused by noise in the AIS data. Finally, we validate the results produced by the GA by comparing resulting patterns with known inland water routes for two Dutch provinces.","data mining,Clustering algorithms,Genetic algorithms,vessel position data cluster,marine navigation,directed graph,maritime pattern extraction,sailing pattern analysis,quadtrees,Biological cells,genetic algorithms,genetic algorithm,ships,Genetic Algorithms,automatic identification system,inland water routes,Dutch provinces,logistics planning,Automatic Identification System,quad tree structure,Data Mining,directed graphs,pattern clustering,Artificial intelligence,route querying,maritime vessel destination prediction,Pattern Recognition,Logistics,Synchromodal Logistics,long term prediction,route waypoints,Boats,logistics data processing,Data mining,AIS data,arrival time prediction,data handling,"

"clutter suppression and target tracking by the low-rank representation for airborne maritime surveillance radar","2020","Moving target detection is of vital importance to maritime security and maritime resource protection. However, the detection of slow or weak targets is difficult based on traditional methods. A new detection method is proposed by using the different motion variations of radar moving target and sea clutter in the range-Doppler spectrum sequence. The first step in implementing this method is the separation of moving target and sea clutter by the low-rank representation, in which the target and clutter are modeled as foreground and background components. Subsequently, a sea clutter discriminator is constructed within the sea clutter bandwidth to further remove the sea clutter (false alarms) that exists in the foreground. The proposed method can reduce the sea clutter power while maintaining the target power and improve the detection rate of moving targets, especially slow or weak targets. Data collected with airborne maritime surveillance radar in maritime moving target indication (MMTI) mode are used to validate the performance of the proposed method. The experimental results demonstrate that the improvement in the signal-to-clutter ratio (SCR) obtained with the proposed method is better than that obtained with space-time adaptive processing (STAP, including 1DT-STAP, 3DT-STAP and sparse-STAP) and principal component pursuit (PCP) methods; additionally, the figure of merit (FOM) of the proposed method is higher than that of the constant false alarm rate (CFAR) and PCP method.

"ais data visualization for maritime spatial planning (msp)","2016","The constant increase in marine traffic and the simultaneous growth of the demand for exploiting marine areas (e.g., installing offshore wind power plants) require an adequate planning strategy for managing high traffic volumes. Maritime Spatial Planning (MSP) is the process of public development of an allocation plan for distributing, both spatially and temporally, human activities in marine areas. The adoption of e-Navigation is a possible solution for improving safety and security at sea by integrating maritime information on board and ashore. Automatic Identification System (AIS) data represents a fundamental source of information, since the analysis of AIS data can highlight the presence of congested areas as well as of illegal actions, such as smuggling, pollution, and unauthorized phishing in protected areas. Indeed, those activities are often characterized by abnormal manoeuvres that can be recognized by analyzing the routes of the vessels. However, the huge dimension of the AIS data to process requires the adoption of careful strategies for the data visualization. In this paper, we present a complete pipeline for visualizing ship routes from raw AIS data, which is a fundamental pre-requisite for carrying out a significant AIS-based route analysis, and describe a real case study, where 90 million AIS records, corresponding to one month of world-wide observations, are visualized using only open-source software.","AIS data visualization,route analysis,intelligent transport systems,e-Navigation,AIS data,"
"permafrost and climate in europe: monitoring and modelling thermal, geomorphological and geotechnical responses","2009","We present a review of the changing state of European permafrost within a spatial zone that includes the continuous high latitude arctic permafrost of Svalbard and the discontinuous high altitude mountain permafrost of Iceland, Fennoscandia and the Alps. The paper focuses on methodological developments and data collection over the last decade or so, including research associated with the continent-scale network of instrumented permafrost boreholes established between 1998 and 2001 under the European Union PACE project. Data indicate recent warming trends, with greatest warming at higher latitudes. Equally important are the impacts of shorter-term extreme climatic events, most immediately reflected in changes in active layer thickness. A large number of complex variables, including altitude, topography, insolation and snow distribution, determine permafrost temperatures. The development of regionally calibrated empirical-statistical models, and physically based process-oriented models, is described, and it is shown that, though more complex and data dependent, process-oriented approaches are better suited to estimating transient effects of climate change in complex mountain topography. Mapping and characterisation of permafrost depth and distribution requires integrated multiple geophysical approaches and recent advances are discussed. We report on recent research into ground ice formation, including ice segregation within bedrock and vein ice formation within ice wedge systems. The potential impacts of climate change on rock weathering, permafrost creep, landslides, rock falls, debris flows and slow mass movements are also discussed. Recent engineering responses to the potentially damaging effects of climate warming are outlined, and risk assessment strategies to minimise geological hazards are described. We conclude that forecasting changes in hazard occurrence, magnitude and frequency is likely to depend on process-based modelling, demanding improved understanding of geomorphological process-response systems and their impacts on human activity.","permafrost engineering,geothermal monitoring,slope stability,climate change,permafost hazards,geothermal modelling,geophysics,European permafrost,"
"shelf-wide analyses of sand wave migration using gis: a case study on the netherlands continental shelf","2023","Shelf seas often display rhythmic bedforms, of which tidal sand waves are the most relevant to study from an engineering point of view due to their dimensions and dynamic nature. Environmental conditions such as water depth, flow velocities and grain size vary across entire shelf regions, consequently influencing the characteristics of tidal sand waves, including migration rates. However, as opposed to site-specific analyses, shelf sea-wide analyses on sand wave migration are scarce. Through the use of timeseries of bathymetric data, we investigate the spatial variability of sand wave migration on the scale of the Netherlands Continental Shelf (NCS). Two existing data-driven techniques, Pairs of Source and Target Points (PSTP) and Spatial Cross Correlation (SCC), were implemented in a Geographic Information System (GIS). Through testing at four sites on the NCS, PSTP was deemed the preferred technique for a shelf-wide analysis and was hence used to quantify the NCS-wide migration rates and directions. To illustrate the spatial variability, the quantified migration rates and directions were averaged per km2. For the NCS in general, migration to the south-west or north-east at typical rates between 0 and 3 m/year was found. The south-western region of the NCS demonstrated migration rates below 0.5 m/year with migration directions alternating over short distances. The north-eastern region exhibited uniform migration to the north-east at rates which gradually increased when in closer proximity to the Wadden Islands. Typical rates in this region were found to be between 2 and 8 m/year. The highest migration rates were observed near coastal regions and on top of sandbanks. The presence of these sandbanks strongly deflects the migration directions of superimposed sand waves at a number of locations. The analysis performed within this study demonstrates valuable insights into methods that can be used to evaluate shelf-wide regions of interest. A deeper understanding of the dynamic nature of the North Sea bed assists in optimising hydrographic re-survey policies, critical infrastructure planning and subsequent monitoring. Furthermore, this study may offer a wider set of tools that could be used for correlating sand wave migration to its governing physical mechanisms and environmental parameters.","North Sea,Data analysis,Spatial variation,Tidal sand wave migration,GIS,Netherlands Continental Shelf,"
"discovering themes and trends in transportation research using topic modeling","2017","Transportation research is a key area in both science and engineering. In this paper, we present an empirical analysis of 17,163 articles published in 22 leading transportation journals from 1990 to 2015. We apply a latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model on article abstracts to infer 50 key topics. We show that those characterized topics are both representative and meaningful, mostly corresponding to established sub-fields in transportation research. These identified fields reveal a research landscape for transportation. Based on the results of LDA, we quantify the similarity of journals and countries/regions in terms of their aggregated topic distributions. By measuring the variation of topic distributions over time, we find some general research trends, such as topics on sustainability, travel behavior and non-motorized mobility are becoming increasingly popular over time. We also carry out this temporal analysis for each journal, observing a high degree of consistency for most journals. However, some interesting anomaly, such as special issues on particular topics, are detected from temporal variation as well. By quantifying the temporal trends at the country/region level, we find that countries/regions display clearly distinguishable patterns, suggesting that research communities in different regions tend to focus on different sub-fields. Our results could benefit different parties in the academic community—including researchers, journal editors and funding agencies—in terms of identifying promising research topics/projects, seeking for candidate journals for a submission, and realigning focus for journal development.","Research policy,Topic modeling,Transportation research,Publication data,"
"a hybrid robotic network for maritime situational awareness: results from the infore22 sea trial","2022","In this paper we describe an integrated system for maritime situational awareness (MSA) applications, built on a cooperative autonomous robotic network, and developed in the maritime use case of the INFORE EU H2020 project. INFORE project developed an interactive, real-time, extreme-scale analytics and forecasting system for handling and analysing massive streams of data. The MSA INFORE system exploits the synergy between global view (AIS data, ESA Sentinel satellite data), which provide contextual information over a wide area, and local view produced by a sensorised hybrid robotic network. Such a network was validated during the INFORE22 sea trial, held off the coast of Portovenere, Italy, in the Gulf of La Spezia, in February-March 2022. It was composed of a thermal camera and of two autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) equipped with passive sonars. The robots fused their measurements, and cooperatively adapted their navigation for localising a suspicious vessel, communicating her position to the MSA INFORE platform in real-time. For controlling the robots, we developed a perception layer, based on an occupancy grid map framework, which enabled the fusion of passive sonar bearing-only measurements for target localisation. The perception layer was also the basis for making cooperative decisions to adapt the network spatial configuration for improving mission performance. In this paper we report and discuss results from the INFORE22 trial. These results are one the first demonstrations of how data fusion and cooperative autonomy can increase the performance of a complex robotic network in a passive sonar surveillance mission in a real-world scenario. The INFORE MSA systems paves the way towards the development of complex, integrated MSA systems, which exploit robotic networks, characterised by advanced cooperative autonomy capabilities, for improving the local view picture, and for promptly reacting to the evolving scenario.","cooperative autonomy,robotic networks,surveillance,INFORE project,MSA INFORE platform,Autonomous Surface Vehicles (ASVs),sensor fusion,integrated system,sensorised hybrid robotic network,INFORE22 trial,network spatial configuration,complex robotic network,INFORE MSA systems,data fusion,Sea measurements,underwater vehicles,maritime situational awareness applications,Decision making,INFORE22 sea trial,complex MSA systems,integrated MSA systems,Sonar measurements,Robot sensing systems,passive sonars,interactive time,autonomous underwater vehicles,Maritime Situational Awareness (MSA),Sonar,ESA Sentinel satellite data,INFORE EU H2020 project,perception layer,sonar,passive sonar surveillance mission,Data integration,AIS data,coastal surveillance,mobile robots,forecasting system,Surveillance,extreme-scale analytics,autonomous robotic network,passive sonar bearing-only,Autonomous Underwater Robots (AUVs),oceanographic techniques,"
"review of the inorganic geochemistry of peats and peatland waters","1988","The major floristic and geochemical differences between bogs, fens, and swamps are summarized, and the most common peat types described. This is followed by a critical, historical review of the literature. The methods used to measure the pH of peatland (mire) waters are examined, and the pH range of various peatland types is reported. In addition, horizontal and vertical pH variations are illustrated, and factors affecting the pH of these waters reviewed. The cause of the low pH of surface waters of Sphagnum bogs (approximately pH 4) is critically investigated, and the relative importance of dissolved CO2 and other inorganic acids, and organic acids to the low pH is assessed. Cation exchange on the surfaces of Sphagnum mosses is found to be a relatively unimportant acidification mechanism, but important to the chemical ecology of the plants. The redox chemistry of mire waters is described in terms of the geochemistry of such redox indicators as O2, CO2, CH4, CO, H2, H2S, SO42−, native Cu, and siderite (FeCO3). Published studies of Eh in peatlands are cited, and the problems of Eh measurement and interpretation are explored. The chemical composition of mire waters (major and trace metals, and nonmetallic species) is examined, and factors affecting their composition reported. The abundance and distribution of mineral matter in peats is described, and the occurrence and formation of minerals of Fe (pyrite and other sulphides, siderite, vivianite), Cu (chalcopyrite, native Cu, covellite) and Zn (smithsonite and wurtzite) investigated.

"area decomposition algorithm for large region maritime search","2020","In this paper, an area decomposition algorithm is presented that is suitable for multiple vessels and multiple aircraft participating in maritime searches over a large region. The algorithm can decompose the entire sea region to be searched (deemed as polygonal area) into nonoverlapping subpolygons (search subareas) according to the sizes of the areas covered by various search facilities while considering their search capabilities as well as their corresponding commence search points. The algorithm draws on the concept of a polygon division algorithm in computational geometry. The main novelty in this study is the optimization of the classic polygon division algorithm by introducing a â€œmaximizing-minimum-angleâ€ strategy, which can effectively compensate for the deficiency of the traditional algorithm, as reflected in the area decomposition result. This improved algorithm can produce rectangle-like subareas, especially for a rectangular search region, which is commonly used in maritime search operations. For nonrectangular search regions, a right-angle division can be achieved so that the shapes of the search subareas are more conducive to planning specific search routes for search facilities. Fast maritime search coverage over a large region can be achieved. The effectiveness of the algorithm is validated by comparing decomposition results before and after the improvement.","area decomposition result,maritime search coverage,search facilities,Vehicle dynamics,maritime searches,search capabilities,area decomposition,Aircraft navigation,Maritime search,entire sea region,Search problems,specific search routes,classic polygon division algorithm,corresponding commence search points,marine safety,optimisation,search facility,Shape,maritime search operations,search subarea,multiple aircraft,polygonal area,Partitioning algorithms,multiple vessels,search problems,Legged locomotion,search subareas,rectangular search region,computational geometry,nonrectangular search regions,region maritime search,Heuristic algorithms,area decomposition algorithm,"
"growth response of scots pines in polar-alpine tree-line to a warming climate","2017","Coniferous trees at the alpine and polar tree lines of the Northern Hemisphere represent the outermost limit of their ecological range. Under such conditions, even small temperature variations may cause growth responses, which therefore can be used as indicators for changing environmental conditions. In this study we analysed the radial growth of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) along a latitudinal and altitudinal gradient at six locations in the polar and alpine tree-line ecotone in Finnish Lapland. We evaluated the effect of climatic trends on pine growth in relation to tree age and region, specifying a northern and a southern region in the study area. We found a response of Scots pine to climatic variations until the 1980s, but not to the current warming period. Increasing growth trends could be detected since 2000 in the radial growth of southern located trees, predominantly of juvenile ages, while the northern trees did not respond significantly to the current warming. In the north recent warmer and wetter conditions during winter time, inducing snow loads, wind damages, diseases and frost damages possibly masked the benefits of warmer conditions. The missing link between warming and radial growth would affect the use of tree-rings as proxy for past climate and for predictions for forest extension in polar-alpine tree-line sites.","Environmental change,Tree age,Tree line,Growth response,Latitudinal and altitudinal gradient,Dendroecology,"
"salinity and temperature profiling for the submarine groundwater discharge simulations: quantification through heat and solute transport model","2022","Developed coastal regions are the hotspots for contaminated groundwater discharge, affecting sensitive marine ecosystems. The present study aims to identify submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) locations and quantify the contaminant load reaching to the western coast of India (Gujarat coast) using stable isotopes, seepage meter, heat and solute transport model. The coastal aquifers are highly enriched in trace metals due to various active natural processes and anthropogenic activities across the coast. Terrestrial and recirculated SGD was a significant contributor to flow and metal load, which ranged from 1.04 to 181.1 m3.year−1 and 0–77.41 kg.year-1, respectively. The highest estimated SGD in the Gujarat coast was relatively less than the SGD reported in the Bay of Bengal and comparable to the South Chennai coast. The order of metal flux found in the study was Zn > Fe > Cr > Pb > Ni > Cu > Mn, whereas the highest flux of Zn (77.41 kg. year−1) was reported at Fansa beach, which was 7x Fe-flux and 45 x Cr-flux, respectively. Higher micronutrients (Fe and Zn) load in the southern coast leads to increased vulnerability of eutrophication, algal blooms and biotic ligand formation in aquatic species. This enrichment of micronutrients in the coastal ecosystem was evident by the growth of seaweeds on the seabed at SGD identified locations.","Numerical modelling,Metal load,SGD,Quantification,Seepage meter,Gujarat coast,"
"chemical composition and acidity of rainfall in the alligator rivers region, northern territory, australia","1990","Rainfall in the Alligator Rivers Region, Northern Territory, is essentially restricted to the period October to April. Rainwater samples from eight sites show that pH is consistently between 4.0 and 5.0, and confirms previous observations of the widespread occurrence of acidic rainwater across the northern parts of Australia. Measurements of anions (sulfate, nitrate, chloride, phosphate) and weak organic acids (formate and acetate) in rainfall, together with pH and conductivity, have shown the presence of local concentrations of ions and the presence of free acidity in excess of that attributed to dissolved carbon dioxide. Much of the acidity was associated with the presence of weak acids; for example, for all Magela samples 47% was weak acids compared with 25.5, 13 and 8% for hydrochloric, sulfuric and nitric acids, respectively. Acidity due to sulfate was therefore low, but sulfate in excess of that derived from sea-salt was of large magnitude; for example, 83% of sulfate for all Magela samples was excess. Possible sources of acidity are natural (burning of vegetation, soil dust, lightning, biogenic emissions from soils and oceans and volcanoes), and anthropogenic (sulfuric acid plant and electricity generating stations and minor emissions from calciners and sulfuric acid aerosols in open vats locally at Jabiru and nearby Nabarlek). The impact of sulfur emissions from the Ranger uranium mine/mill complex (sulfuric acid plant and electricity generating station) on rainwater acidity in the surrounding Jabiru area was examined, but the fate of the sulfur dioxide emissions was not known. Difficulties in establishing the significance of contributions from anthropogenic sources against this background of natural acidity are attributed to a lack of information on the proportions of chloride, sulfate and nitrate from these sources.",""
"deep-sea communities dominated by the giant clam, calyptogena soyoae, along the slope foot of hatsushima island, sagami bay, central japan","1989","Calyptogena-vestimentiferan tube worm communities were observed over a distance of roughly 7 km along the foot of the Hatsushima escarpment, Sagami Bay, central Japan, between depths of 900 and 1200 m by means of towed TV-still camera system and a submersible. The composition of the communities, the occurrence of a positive temperature anomaly of about 0.5°C within the community beds and an extremely high amounts of methane in the bottom water, indicated the presence of cold seepage. The biomass of living Calyptogena was estimated to surpass 10 kg m−2, which was three orders of magnitude higher than that of the usual nearshore deep-sea benthic communities at an equivalent depth. The present results, combined with the electron microscopic evidence for symbiotic bacteria and the high sulfur content and negative σ34S value in the gills of the Calyptogena soyoae collected from the communities, and the stable and radioactive carbon isotopic compositions of the clam suggested that the seepage system of the Hatsushima site is similar to those found at other plate convergent areas such as off Oregon and off Peru and in the Japan Trench with symbiotic bacteria (probably sulfur and/or methane bacteria) playing important nutritional roles to support the seepage communities.",""
"on the effectiveness of ai-assisted anomaly detection methods in maritime navigation","2020","The automatic identification system (AIS) has become an essential tool for maritime security. Nevertheless, how to effectively use the static and dynamic voyage information of the AIS data in maritime traffic situation awareness is still a challenge. This paper presents a comparative study of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques on their effectiveness in dealing with various anomalies in maritime domain using the AIS data. The AIS on-off switching (OOS) anomaly is critical in maritime security, since AIS technology is susceptible to manipulation and it can be switched on and off to hide illegal activities. Thus, we try to detect and distinguish between intentional and non-intentional AIS OOS anomalies through our AI -assisted anomaly detection framework. We use AIS data, in particular positional and navigational status of vessels, to study the effectiveness of seven AI techniques, such as artificial neural network, support vector machine, logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, decision tree, random forest and naive Bayes, in detecting the AIS OOS anomalies. Our experimental results show that ANN and SVM are the most suitable techniques in detecting the AIS OOS anomalies with 99.9% accuracy. Interestingly, the ANN model outperforms others when trained with a balanced (i.e., same order of samples per class) dataset, and SVM, on the other hand, is suitable when training dataset is unbalanced.","maritime traffic situation awareness,AI-assisted anomaly detection,decision trees,Support vector machines,logistic regression,Anomaly detection,static voyage information,random forests,ANN,marine navigation,Feature extraction,security of data,maritime security,k-nearest neighbors,regression analysis,AIS technology,naive Bayes,neural nets,naive Bayes methods,automatic identification system,marine safety,marine engineering,support vector machines,maritime navigation,dynamic voyage information,maritime domain,random forest,SVM,Artificial intelligence,AIS on-off switching anomaly,nearest neighbour methods,artificial neural network,Training,Trajectory,support vector machine,nonintentional AIS OOS anomalies,Navigation,artificial intelligence,decision tree,AIS data,"
"enabling maritime risk assessment using natural language processing-based deep learning techniques","2020","Maritime vessels around the world risk encountering dangerous situations during their voyages such as piracy, kidnappings, hijackings, and smugglings. Such dangers may put crews at risk and potentially cause extensive damage to both the vessel and its cargo. Maritime risk assessment is a process of analyzing such factors to positively impact the safety and timeliness of operations. Analyzing the high-risk areas in seas and oceans can help vessels route around areas with previously recorded high levels of dangerous activities. This information is scraped and extracted from various maritime documents, including newspaper articles, social media, incident blogs, and operational reports. After textual data sources are parsed, it is possible to use this extracted information as training datasets into a Machine Learning (ML) model using Natural Language Processing (NLP) Deep Learning (DL) techniques. With these methods, we can perform document classification, risk extraction, text summarization, topic modeling, and information extraction in an automated manner. Methods that are used include the bag-of words (BOW) approach and, in particular, the use of Named Entity Recognition (NER) to identify specific areas around the world that are considered a risk to a particular voyage. Once this information is processed, the model can determine and aggregate specific areas of high-risk activity. We propose a Maritime Event Log (MEL) pipeline using DL methods. This pipeline includes binary document classification (DC) to extract positive instances of incidents, an incident type classification (IC,) and an information extraction module (IE) including date and location and ship type extraction. With such information available, it is possible to avoid dangerous situations, which may have a significant level of impact on the safety and success rate of maritime operations.","Bit error rate,Pipelines,newspaper articles,Text categorization,Hidden Markov models,deep learning (artificial intelligence),Information retrieval,machine learning model,maritime vessels,information retrieval,natural language processing,maritime risk assessment,safety,bag-of words approach,high-risk activity,information extraction module,ships,marine safety,marine engineering,maritime event log pipeline,vessels route,operational reports,ship type extraction,named entity recognition,risk management,pattern classification,incident type classification,Classification algorithms,maritime documents,text summarization,incident blogs,Training,risk extraction,textual data sources,text analysis,deep learning techniques,social media,maritime operations,binary document classification,topic modeling,"

"the impact of climate change on the storm surges of the mediterranean sea: coastal sea level responses to deep depression atmospheric systems","2023","This study aims to systematically assess the impacts of projected climate change on episodic events of sea level elevation in coastal areas of the Mediterranean, induced by severe weather conditions identified as deep depressions. We try to add new insight in the long-term, climatic timescale, identification of affected parts of the Mediterranean coastal zone correlated to low atmospheric pressure systems, indicative of the Mediterranean basin during the 21st century. To achieve this goal, an integrated quantitative assessment is proposed by combining projections from available and established, green-house gasses emission/concentration scenarios (based on Representative Concentration Pathways; RCP 4.5 and 8.5) with advanced numerical modelling and statistical post-processing for the definition of cyclonic weather impacts on characteristic coastal zone hotspots. To this end, climate projections and outputs from three Regional Climate Models (RCMs) of the Med-CORDEX initiative at the Mediterranean basin scale are used and extensively evaluated against re-analysis data. These atmospheric datasets feed a robust storm surge model (MeCSS) for the simulation of barotropic hydrodynamics (sea level elevation and currents) thoroughly validated against in situ sea level observations by tide-gauges. Our results corroborate a projected storminess attenuation for the end of the 21st century, yet local differentiations in storm surge maxima around the Mediterranean coastal zone are pinpointed. Moreover, a slight reduction of average storm-induced Mean Sea Level (MSL; component attributed solely to the meteorological residual of sea level elevation) is also apparent towards the end of the 21st century. Extreme storm surge magnitudes range between 0.35 and 0.50 m in the Mediterranean with higher values along parts of its northern coasts (Venice lagoon, Gulf of Lions, northern Adriatic and Aegean Seas, etc.) and the Gulf of Gabes in its southern part. Overall, the spatial distributions of surge maxima are estimated to remain similar to those of the past throughout the entire Mediterranean coastal zone. Differentiations between the two scenarios (RCP4.5-8.5) used are obvious, not so much related to the spatiotemporal distribution of storm surge maxima, which shows a very stable pattern, but more in terms of their magnitudes. Indicatively, a decrease of surge maxima from -30% to -2% can be observed towards the end of the 21st century, especially for RCP8.5-driven MeCSS simulations. This is a spatially averaged estimation, yet for some specific coastal sites in Croatia, Spain Italy, and France, such as Rovinj, Bakar, Toulon, Trieste, Ajaccio, Genova, Marseilles, Naples, Venice, Cagliari, Ancona, Ibixa, and Barcelona, the storm surge maxima might increase from 1% to 22% under different RCM/RCP combinations towards the end of the 21st century. Our analysis leads to the quantification of deep depression systems’ effect on the coastal sea level elevation due to storm surges towards 2100. The strongest correlations of deep depression events to high sea levels are observed in several parts along the northern Mediterranean coasts (Gulfs of Valencia and Lions, Ligurian and northern Adriatic Seas). They are followed by mid-latitude areas around Corsica, Sardinia, the mid-zonal Italian Peninsula and the Adriatic, and the northern Aegean Sea. The influence of deep depressions on storm surges is lower for Sicily, South Italy, Peloponnese, Crete, the southern Aegean archipelago, and Alboran Sea. The only exceptions in the generally unaffected southern Mediterranean littorals are the Gulfs of Gabes and Alexandretta. These apply to the 20th century; however, they seem to repeat for the 21st century estimations, with even more pronounced differentiations between the southern and the northern parts. A projected northward shift of the main deep depression centres over the Mediterranean towards the end of the 21st century, is likely the reason for the latter. The climate change signal (difference of Future–Reference Period) of the deep cyclones’ effect on the episodic increases of coastal sea level seems to have a very clear pattern of slight attenuation in certain regions, i.e., Sardinia, Corsica, the Ligurian and Adriatic Seas, and the entire Italian peninsula for all RCM-fed implementations towards the end of the 21st century. Conditionally, this is the case for the Gulf of Valencia, the north-western African coasts, the Alboran, Ionian, Aegean, and Libyan Sea coasts, under specific combinations of RCM/RCP forcings. On the other hand, a possible increase of the Mediterranean deep depressions’ influence on the coastal storm surges might be the case for the Gulf of Lions, the Ionian, Aegean and Levantine Sea basins, covering the north-central and north-eastern coasts of Africa. In general, a positive influence of deep depressions to storm surge maxima would probably refer to areas of mid-to-high storm surge maxima (e.g., Aegean, Ionian, Gulf of Lions or Valencia or Gabes, etc.), but not the highest throughout the basin (e.g., Venice lagoon, Ligurian, Adriatic, etc.). In the latter coastal regions, however, intense local wind forcing mechanisms (i.e., Scirocco) are bound to play an essential role in the formation of high storm surges. The produced results can be used in focused studies for integrated hydrologic/hydrodynamic modelling under projected climate change conditions in the 21st century.","Mediterranean Sea,Deep depression,Sea surface height,Coastal zone,Representative Concentration Pathway,Inverse barometer effect,Storm surge,Climate change,Med-CORDEX,"
"deep learning approaches for ais data association in the context of maritime domain awareness","2020","Automatic Identification System (AIS) allows the ships to broadcast important kinematic and static information, and is one of the most commonly used tools for ship traffic monitoring as individual tracks can be inferred from chronological sequence of the ships' AIS messages. In this paper, we propose two deep learning based methods for AIS data association. The first method predicts a ship's position at the time of a new message and then computes the association probability. The second method computes the association probability directly without ship position interpolation. Both methods use only three AIS data attributes for inference: longitude, latitude and time. We validate the proposed methods' performance with real AIS dataset and show that they achieve reliable data association.","Kinematics,static information,Prediction algorithms,association probability,Marine vehicles,maritime domain awareness,AIS data attributes,Predictive models,ship traffic monitoring,AIS track prediction,neural nets,deep learning,ships,marine engineering,Automatic Identification System,Data models,traffic information systems,data association,probability,kinematic information,Computational modeling,learning (artificial intelligence),AIS data association,"

"on the interest of data mining for an integrity assessment of ais messages","2016","Put in place by the International Maritime Organization, the Automatic Identification System is a worldwide maritime electronic system that sends radio broadcasted messages at a high rate between the stations, either on board the vessels or on shores. However, some misuses of the system such as identity theft, localization spoofing or disappearances have been demonstrated. The high rate of transmission implies a considerable amount of data to process in order to point out those irregularities. This paper proposes a method based on data mining and clustering methods combined to an integrity assessment of AIS messages for anomaly detection, with a proposition of software architecture for a data processing done both on-the-fly and with archived data.

"trajectory pattern extraction and anomaly detection for maritime vessels","2021","Trajectory analysis and extraction of trajectory patterns are crucial to enhance marine safety and marine status awareness. The major data source for such analysis is Automatic Identification System (AIS), which publishes data related to movement of the ship while cruising. AIS broadcasts information including type of ship, identity number, state, destination, estimated time of arrival (ETA), location, speed, direction, and cargo. In this paper, we focus on extracting a variety of trajectory patterns for maritime vessels. The first group of analysis we focus on is arrival port, arrival time, and next position prediction on AIS messages, which are useful to aid maritime operators. We propose three different approaches for the prediction of marine vessel movement. As the second type of analysis, anomaly detection on marine vessel trajectory is studied. For vessel movement prediction, the experiments show that the proposed solutions brought improvement against conventional supervised learning approaches. The proposed anomaly detection technique is demonstrated on a case study.","Trajectory,Maritime,LSTM,Next position prediction,Anomaly detection,Arrival port prediction,Arrival time prediction,Supervised learning,AIS,"
"paleotemperature reconstructions using speleothem fluid inclusion analyses from hungary","2021","The combined use of the stable isotope compositions of speleothem carbonate and inclusion-hosted water presents great potential in paleotemperature reconstructions, due to the various temperature-dependent isotope fractionations detected in cave systems and their environment. This paper evaluates the applicational possibilities of hydrogen and oxygen isotope measurements of inclusion-hosted water and its host calcite, in three different approaches: i) direct determination of calcite-water oxygen isotope fractionation by measuring inclusion water and carbonate compositions, ii) calculation of water oxygen isotope composition from hydrogen isotope data and of temperature from the inferred calcite-water fractionation, and iii) calculation of formation temperature from measured hydrogen isotope data and its temperature dependence in the modern precipitation water. Fluid inclusion oxygen and hydrogen isotope compositions as well as calcite oxygen isotope compositions were determined for five speleothem occurrences in Hungary. Although the background processes are not resolved, calculations involving measured calcite and water oxygen isotope compositions yielded unrealistic paleotemperatures, likely because of syn-formation isotope fractionation processes and diagenetic alterations. The hydrogen isotope data may yield realistic temperatures, provided that long-term isotopic composition - temperature relationships are known and the stable hydrogen isotope composition of the precipitation waters in the study area is temperature-controlled. Winter half-year and annual isotope-temperature relationships (δ2H/T gradients) were calculated using multidecadal isotope composition records from the Global Network of Isotopes in Precipitation (GNIP), gridded surface temperatures, and precipitation amounts from the E-OBS 21.0e database. The calculations yielded a paleotemperature record for the last ~250 ka, with average precisions ranging from ±0.6 °C for interglacial to ±2.4 °C for glacial periods. Clumped isotope analyses of cave-hosted flowstones support the inferred formation temperatures based on gradients, while detection of kinetic fractionations by combined hydrogen and oxygen isotope analyses of calcite and inclusion water lead to filtering clumped isotope (Δ47) data and more coherent Δ47-temperature relationships.","Fluid inclusion,Paleotemperature reconstruction,Clumped isotope,Speleothem,Stable isotope composition,Calcite,"
"an adaptive ionosphere clutter suppression and target detection method for hfswr maritime surveillance","2023","High-frequency surface wave radar (HFSWR) as a maritime surveillance facility faces the tough challenges. One of them is that various unwanted echo components constantly destroy the detection performance of HFSWR, especially the dynamically changing ionosphere clutter. This article proposes an adaptive ionosphere clutter suppression and target detection algorithm (AICSTD) based on improved higher order singular value decomposition (HOSVD) and deep learning network. First, we analyze the multiple-dimensional characteristics of different types of ionosphere clutter echo data. Then, refer to the multichannel HFSWR echo data structure, we apply simplified HOSVD and orthogonal subspace projection to eliminate the unwanted echo component and, meanwhile, preserve the target echo. The key parameter of simplified HOSVD is determined by the mean structural similarity (MSSIM) index, which contributes to reduce the computation complexity of the proposed method. Finally, we improved the deep learning network to detect the targets in various behaviors after the clutter suppression. In order to address the issue of limited clutter data, transfer learning based on historical radar echo data is applied. A thorough experimental analysis on various real clutter data shows that the proposed method performs competitively. Our method shows a superior performance over many state-of-the-art clutter suppression methods, with a covered target detection accuracy of 92.4% under strong spread clutter background.","Ionosphere,structural similarity (SSIM) index,higher order singular value decomposition (HOSVD),ionosphere clutter suppression,Tensors,Clutter,Deep learning,Object detection,Doppler effect,target detection,high-frequency surface wave radar (HFSWR),Reflection,"

"characterizing the vertical profile of aerosol particle extinction and linear depolarization over southeast asia and the maritime continent: the 2007–2009 view from caliop","2013","Vertical profiles of 0.532μm aerosol particle extinction coefficient and linear volume depolarization ratio are described for Southeast Asia and the Maritime Continent. Quality-screened and cloud-cleared Version 3.01 Level 2 NASA Cloud Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) 5-km Aerosol Profile datasets are analyzed from 2007 to 2009. Numerical simulations from the U.S. Naval Aerosol Analysis and Predictive System (NAAPS), featuring two-dimensional variational assimilation of NASA Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer and Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer quality-assured datasets, combined with regional ground-based lidar measurements, are considered for assessing CALIOP retrieval performance, identifying bias, and evaluating regional representativeness. CALIOP retrievals of aerosol particle extinction coefficient and aerosol optical depth (AOD) are high over land and low over open waters relative to NAAPS (0.412/0.312 over land for all data points inclusive, 0.310/0.235 when the per bin average is used and each is treated as single data points; 0.102/0.151 and 0.086/0.124, respectively, over ocean). Regional means, however, are very similar (0.180/0.193 for all data points and 0.155/0.159 when averaged per normalized bin), as the two factors offset one another. The land/ocean offset is investigated, and discrepancies attributed to interpretation of particle composition and a-priori assignment of the extinction-to-backscatter ratio (“lidar ratio”) necessary for retrieving the extinction coefficient from CALIOP signals. Over land, NAAPS indicates more dust present than CALIOP algorithms are identifying, indicating a likely assignment of a higher lidar ratio representative of more absorptive particles. NAAPS resolves more smoke over water than identified with CALIOP, indicating likely usage of a lidar ratio characteristic of less absorptive particles to be applied that biases low AOD there. Over open waters except within the Bay of Bengal, aerosol particle scattering is largely capped below 1.5km MSL, though ground-based lidar measurements at Singapore differ slightly from this finding. Significant aerosol particle presence over land is similarly capped near 3.0km MSL over most regions. Particle presence at low levels regionally, except over India, is dominated by relatively non-depolarizing particles. Industrial haze, sea salt droplets and fresh smoke are thus most likely present.","Southeast Asia,Lidar,Aerosol particle scattering,CALIPSO,Aerosol composition,Maritime Continent,"
"palaeomagnetism and magnetic anisotropy of carboniferous red beds from the maritime provinces of canada: evidence for shallow palaeomagnetic inclinations and implications for north american apparent polar wander","2010","A palaeomagnetic and magnetic anisotropy study was conducted on the lower-middle Carboniferous Maringouin and Shepody red bed formations of the Maritime Provinces of Canada to detect and correct inclination shallowing. Because of the shallow inclinations commonly observed in red beds and the strong dependence of North America's Palaeo-Mesozoic apparent polar wander (APW) on red beds, inclination shallowing may substantially affect large portions of North America's APW path. Hematite is the primary magnetic mineral carrier in these red beds, accompanied by secondary magnetite, maghemite, goethite and pigmentary hematite. Thermal and chemical demagnetization of the Shepody Fm. successfully isolated characteristic remanence directions of D= 177Â°, I= 20.4Â°, Î±95= 6.5Â°, N= 19 and D= 177.8Â°I= 17.7Â°, Î±95= 6.9Â°, N= 16, respectively. Thermal demagnetization of the Maringouin Fm. isolated a characteristic remanence direction of D= 178.7Â°, I= 24.9Â°, Î±95= 14.5Â°, N= 9.High field anisotropy of isothermal remanence followed by alternating field and thermal cleaning on leached samples was used to isolate the fabric of hematite. Individual particle anisotropy was measured directly from magnetic separates using a new technique. Hematite's magnetic fabric and particle anisotropy were used to apply an inclination correction. Our inclination corrections indicate up to 10Â° of inclination shallowing, corresponding to corrected palaeopole positions of 27.2Â°N, 118.3Â°E, A95= 6.2Â° and 27.4Â°N, 117.2Â°E, A95= 13.1Â° for the Shepody and Maringouin formations, respectively. This correction corresponds to a âˆ¼ 6Â° increase in colatitude for Carboniferous North America, which translates into approximately a 650 km change in North America's palaeogeographic position. The proposed position of North America supports a Pangea B-type reconstruction.","Palaeomagnetism applied to Tectonics,Magnetic mineralogy and petrology,Palaeomagnetism applied to geologic processes,Magnetic fabrics and anisotropy,Rock and mineral magnetism,"

"towards a scientific understanding of the risk from extreme space weather","2011","Like all natural hazards, space weather exhibits occasional extreme events over timescales of decades to centuries. Historical events provoked much interest, and sometimes alarm, because bright aurora becomes visible at mid-latitudes. However, they had little economic impact because the major technologies of those eras were not sensitive to space weather. This is no longer true. The widespread adoption of advanced technological infrastructures over the past 40years has created significant sensitivity. So these events now have the potential to disrupt those infrastructures – and thus have profound economic and societal impact. However, like all extreme hazards, such events are rare, so we have limited data on which to build our understanding of the events. This limitation is uniquely serious for space weather since it is a global phenomenon. Many other natural hazards (e.g. flash floods) are highly localised, so statistically significant datasets can be assembled by combining data from independent instances of the hazard recorded over a few decades. Such datasets are the foundation on which reliable risk assessment methodologies are built. But we have a single instance of space weather so we would have to make observations for many centuries in order to build a statistically significant dataset. We show that it is not practicable to assess the risk from extreme events using simple statistical methods. Instead we must exploit our knowledge of solar-terrestrial physics to find other ways to assess these risks. We discuss three alternative approaches: (a) use of proxy data, (b) studies of other solar systems, and (c) use of physics-based modelling. We note that the proxy data approach is already well-established as a technique for assessing the long-term risk from radiation storms, but does not yet provide any means to assess the risk from severe geomagnetic storms. This latter risk is more suited to the other approaches, but significant research is needed to make progress. We need to develop and expand techniques to monitoring key space weather features in other solar systems (stellar flares, radio emissions from planetary aurorae). And to make progress in modelling severe space weather, we need to focus on the physics that controls severe geomagnetic storms, e.g. how can dayside and tail reconnection be modulated to expand the region of open flux to envelop mid-latitudes?","Space weather,Severe events,Risk assessment,Extreme events,Natural hazards,"
"magnetic detection of ship ballast deposits and anchorage sites in king herod's roman harbour, caesarea maritima, israel","2009","Ballast stone deposits are a common feature of sediments in ancient harbour basins but are often overlooked as a potential source of archaeological information. Recent geophysical investigations at Caesarea Maritima in Israel have discovered a thick, laterally extensive ballast layer in the area seaward of the 1st c. BC Roman harbour. The ballast deposits were identified by low-relief mounds on the seabed with elevated magnetic intensities. Jet probing and excavation of magnetic anomalies at several locations revealed a 20–60cm thick rubble layer containing large quantities of Late Roman and Byzantine pottery, local sedimentary boulders (kurkar sandstone, limestone cobbles) and foreign igneous and metamorphic boulders (granite, schist, volcanics; ca. 50%). The foreign boulders and pottery identify the rubble layer as ballast and ships refuse jettisoned by merchant ships outside the harbour. The strong magnetic contrast between the ballast deposits and the natural seabed sediments is attributed to the high magnetic susceptibility (>10−3SI) of crystalline boulders and pottery materials within the ballast rubble. AMS 14C and OSL dates and pottery evidence indicate the ballast accumulation began in the Late Roman period (ca. 200–330 AD) and continued well into the Late Byzantine (ca. 7th c. AD). The main phase of ballast deposition (ca. 4th–5th c. AD) coincided with a decline in the state of Caesarea's harbour following a destructive tsunami event in the early 2nd c. AD and records a shift to a more intensive use of the area seaward of the harbour as an anchorage and ballast lightening area.","Harbour,Magnetic survey,Caesarea Maritima,Ballast,Anchorages,"

"9.18 - the response of glaciers to climate change: observations and impacts","2022","The response of glaciers to atmospheric warming has become a key issue in scientific as well as public and even political discussions about human impacts on the climate system. The predominant tendency of continued worldwide glacier shrinkage indeed constitutes one of the clearest indications in nature of rapid climate change at a global scale. The observed trend of increasingly negative mass balances is consistent with an accelerated trend in global warming and correspondingly enhanced energy flux toward the earth surface. Mountain ranges at lower latitudes have lost large percentages of their glacier areas and volumes since the end of the Little Ice Age. Many of them may become mostly or even completely de-glaciated during the coming decades. Such changes have the potential to profoundly affect environmental conditions far beyond cold mountain chains. Sea-level rise, shifting seasonality in water supply, and local formation of new lakes reflect changes in the water cycle at global, continental, and regional-to-local scales. They are accompanied by rather marked changes in cold-mountain landscape appearance, slope stability, erosion/sedimentation, and hazard conditions. Worldwide monitoring of glaciers today involves process-oriented field measurements, high-resolution geodetic information from space and new terrestrial technologies, but also faces difficult challenges of vanishing glaciers with long-term mass-balance observations. Combining rich observational data with spatio-temporal modeling increasingly helps to prepare integrated analyses of observed phenomena and with anticipating likely future developments as a basis for the planning and realization of climate adaptation strategies. This article examines the monitoring and inventory of glaciers worldwide, observed and forecasted changes, and impacts of deglaciation on geomorphic and water resources systems.","Slope stability,Water cycle,High mountains,Runoff,New landscapes,Sea level,Climate-system monitoring,Cryosphere,Climate change impacts,Permafrost,Glacier fluctuations,Lakes,Glacier inventories,"
"glacial geology as a key to geochemical exploration in areas of glacial overburden with particular reference to canada","1973","The applicability of geochemical exploration procedures in previously glaciated areas is largely a function of the nature of the glacial sediments. A considerable diversity of glacial sediments and landforms results from a phase of glaciation, these products bearing variable compositional relationships to the local bedrock, and thus have varying usefulness in geochemical exploration. A classification of glacial sediments and landforms is described, with emphasis being placed on the provenance of the material composing the different types. The nature and extent of the Wisconsin glaciation in Canada is summarized, together with a review of the distribution of glacial sediments and landforms. Variations in the nature of the glaciation and the distribution of different glacial sediments and landforms have contributed to the situation that the applicability of geochemical exploration techniques varies across Canada. The nature of metal dispersion in glacial sediments resulting directly from glacial activity is discussed, particular reference being given to those features that have proved effective in geochemical exploration. The role of dispersion patterns in glacial sediments and landforms is discussed with regard to varying scales of geochemical exploration programs. Variations in the distribution of glacial sediments and the nature of associated dispersion patterns, both on the regional and local scales, make a consideration of the glacial geology an essential feature for the implementation of appropriate geochemical exploration procedures.",""
"locating submerged prehistoric settlements: a new underwater survey method using water-jet coring and micro-geoarchaeological techniques","2021","In the past few decades the field of submerged prehistory has produced important data highlighting ancient coastal habitation across the globe. Most prehistoric underwater sites are discovered by chance (e.g., by industry, fishermen or recreational divers). New methods for detecting submerged prehistoric settlements have been developed using sophisticated remote sensing devices, yet with limited success. Simple, practical, and inexpensive methods for locating submerged settlements remain rare. Over 60 years of underwater archaeology and submerged prehistory in Israel, specifically along the Carmel coast, has led to a model for locating and studying submerged settlements, based on sand removal by storms. This study aimed to take this model a step further by developing a new, inexpensive method to identify, locate and characterize submerged sites. We collected undisturbed paleosol cores from exposed areas as well as under a few meters of sand, using a newly developed water-jet core sampling system. The cores were analyzed using micro-geoarchaeological techniques initially developed on terrestrial sites. The rationale behind this methodology is based on established knowledge that where human settlements occur, sediments are enriched by specific mineralogical signatures (e.g., heated clay minerals) and anthropogenic micro-remain assemblages (e.g., phytoliths, ash pseudomorphs and dung spherulites). Additionally, micromorphology can assist in identifying micro-stratigraphic patterns typical of human settlements. We tested sediment cores in three underwater contexts: a) exposed prehistoric surfaces within two known Neolithic sites (Atlit-Yam and Neve Yam), b) exposed paleosols without visible archaeological remains (serving as a control), and c) as a blind test, a buried paleosol currently covered by 1–3 m of sand, where the existence of a site is unknown. In the cores taken from the exposed Neolithic settlements, the micro-geoarchaeological characterization showed clear anthropogenic signals (typical mineralogy, elevated micro-remain concentrations, micro-stratigraphy). In the paleosol control cores, there was an absence (or negligible presence) of anthropogenic signals. The ‘blind test’ at the sand-covered locality revealed sediments without anthropogenic enrichments (similar to the control paleosols), thus suggesting the absence of a submerged settlement in this specific location. The new method is time- and cost-effective and can easily be applied worldwide along the shallow continental shelf as well as in deep water. The new method will facilitate discovery of new underwater sites and provide selection criteria (e.g., where the highest anthropogenic signal exists) for investment in underwater excavations. Additionally, it can be used to check for anthropogenic signals in buried locations detected by remote sensing, and to understand the spatial organization of submerged sites.","Manual coring,Neolithic Carmel coast,Micro-geoarchaeology,Submerged prehistory,Underwater archaeology,Water-jet coring,"
"detection of ais messages falsifications and spoofing by checking messages compliance with tdma protocol","2023","Automatic identification system is a navigation aid system that allows vessels to exchange automatically positions, identity and other information. It improves the safety of the maritime traffic and helps to monitor it. However, this system can be manipulated to send falsified information and to mask illicit activities. While previous research has proposed strategies to detect these threats, none of them suggest a solution that considers the time-division multiple access (TDMA) communication protocol. In this work, the compliance of the sent messages with this protocol, specified by the system's standard, is checked for every ship to detect message falsifications. Furthermore, because the ships velocity affects TDMA protocol, a strategy based a Kalman filter is applied to track every ship and to assess the consistency of their velocity data sent. The proposed strategy was validated on real data and showed very promising results. Being computationally cheap, the method can be run in real time. Source codes of the method are open-source to foster research activities from both industry and academia in this field.","Automatic Identification System (AIS),Spoofing detection,TDMA protocol,Falsifications detection,Kalman filtering,"
"precision analysis of the maritime multi-sensor data alignment based on relative bearing and rang","2010","To solve data alignment problem of multi-platform multi-sensor on the sea, a multi-sensor data alignment method based on relative bearing and range is proposed. Using the measurements of relative bearing and range among the maritime platforms, the targets' positions measured are transformed in the sensor relative bearing cordinates of a platform, and the sensor alignment is achieved. The method above can be implemented by means of two coordinate transformation approachs. The alignment mechanisms and mathematical models of both approachs are discussed. Through several simulation scenarios, the precision of two transformation approachs are analysed and campared. Simulation results are employed to decide two approachs' applicable environment according to the precision requirements of establishing the fire-control-level situation.","relative range,alignment mechanisms,sensor fusion,Position measurement,distance measurement,Sensor systems,fire-control-level situation,precision analysis,maritime multisensor data alignment,data fusion,Sea measurements,Data engineering,sea,target tracking,marine systems,target position,mathematical models,coordinate transformation approachs,Robotics and automation,direction-of-arrival estimation,Sensor arrays,Coordinate measuring machines,data alignment problem,sensor relative bearing coordinate system,Earth,Analytical models,Navigation,navigation,relative bearing,sensor alignment,maritime cooperation,"

"unsupervised hierarchical methodology of maritime traffic pattern extraction for knowledge discovery","2022","Owing to the space–air–ground integrated networks (SAGIN), seaborne shipping has attracted increasing interest in the research on the motion behavior knowledge extraction and navigation pattern mining problems in the era of maritime big data for improving maritime traffic safety management. This study aims to develop a novel unsupervised methodology for feature extraction and knowledge discovery based on automatic identification system (AIS) data, allowing for seamless knowledge transfer to support trajectory data mining. The unsupervised hierarchical methodology is constructed from three parts: trajectory compression, trajectory similarity measure, and trajectory clustering. In the first part, an adaptive Douglas–Peucker with speed (ADPS) algorithm is created to preserve critical features, obtain useful information, and simplify trajectory information. Then, dynamic time warping (DTW) is utilized to measure the similarity between trajectories as the critical indicator in trajectory clustering. Finally, the improved spectral clustering with mapping (ISCM) is presented to extract vessel traffic behavior characteristics and mine movement patterns for enhancing marine safety and situational awareness. Comprehensive experiments are conducted and implemented in the Chengshan Jiao Promontory in China to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the novel methodology. Experimental results show that the proposed methodology can effectively compress the trajectories, determine the number of clusters in advance, guarantee the clustering accuracy, and extract useful navigation knowledge while significantly reducing the computational cost. The clustering results are further explored and follow the Gaussian mixture distribution, which can help provide new discriminant criteria for trajectory clustering.","Trajectory compression,Pattern extraction,Maritime traffic safety management,Knowledge discovery,Trajectory clustering,"
"a data mining method to extract traffic network for maritime transport management","2023","Maritime traffic network is essential for navigation efficiency and safety of the maritime transport system. This study proposes a framework for extracting maritime traffic network based on Automatic Identification System (AIS) data. The framework consists of maritime traffic pattern recognition, semantic routes extraction, route decomposition, and network generation. Firstly, a data-driven method is introduced to recognize ship behavior patterns and extends the single ship behaviors to regional characteristics to determine the departure-arrival areas. Then, based on the different combination of departure-arrival areas, the ship trajectories are classified to traffic groups. Subsequently, the grid-system is used to rasterize each traffic group, which realizes the fusion of trajectory data and geographic location information. Finally, to obtain the main routes and navigation channels, the extraction method is introduced by establishing the cumulative grid importance function. The main routes, together with the navigation channels, compose the maritime traffic network. The method is applied to AIS data in the Beibu Gulf, and the results show that the traffic network contains 12 stop areas, 4 entry/exit locations, 13 main routes as well as their corresponding navigation channels. It is therefore concluded that the proposed method helps (1) provide a theoretical framework to obtain and analyze the maritime traffic network and (2) enrich navigation channel identification methods for maritime transport management.","Maritime traffic network,Maritime transport management,AIS,Machine learning,Big data analytics,"
"unambiguous imaging for moving targets in maritime scenarios with dual receive channel mode of gf-3 satellite","2019","Gaofen-3 (GF-3) is the first Chinese multichannel synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensor that can operate in the dual receive channel (DRC) mode. Different from the traditional single-channel SAR system, the multichannel SAR system can overcome the inherent limitation to achieve high-resolution and wide-swath (HRWS) at the same time. However, the key challenge it faces is false target suppression. Especially for the moving vessels on the ocean, the existence of false targets will increase false alarm probability and affect the interpretation of SAR images. In this paper, the method of integration of detection, velocity estimation, location, and imaging for moving targets in the HRWS SAR system is proposed as well as applied to get an unambiguous image.

"deep learning-powered vessel trajectory prediction for improving smart traffic services in maritime internet of things","2022","The maritime Internet of Things (IoT) has recently emerged as a revolutionary communication paradigm where a large number of moving vessels are closely interconnected in intelligent maritime networks. However, the tremendous growth of vessel trajectories, collected from the combined satellite-terrestrial AIS (automatic identification system) base stations, could lead to unsatisfactory maritime safety and efficacy. To promote smart traffic services in maritime IoT, it is necessary to accurately and robustly predict the spatiotemporal vessel trajectories. It is beneficial for collision avoidance, maritime surveillance, and abnormal behavior detection, etc. Motivated by the strong learning capacity of deep neural networks, this work proposes an AIS data-driven trajectory prediction framework, whose main component is a long short term memory (LSTM) network. In particular, the vessel traffic conflict situation modeling, generated using the dynamic AIS data and social force concept, is embedded into the LSTM network to guarantee high-accuracy vessel trajectory prediction. In addition, a mixed loss function is reconstructed to make our prediction results more reliable and robust in different navigation environments. Several quantitative and qualitative experiments have been implemented on realistic AIS-based vessel trajectories. Our results have demonstrated that the proposed method could achieve satisfactory prediction performance in terms of accuracy and robustness.","surveillance,dynamic AIS data,LSTM network,Hidden Markov models,deep learning (artificial intelligence),Internet of Things,smart traffic service improvement,abnormal behavior detection,high-accuracy vessel trajectory prediction,intelligent maritime networks,Predictive models,deep learning-powered vessel trajectory prediction,maritime IoT,deep neural networks,Maritime Internt of Things,deep learning,moving vessels,ships,automatic identification system,marine safety,marine engineering,maritime surveillance,vessel traffic services,AIS data-driven trajectory prediction framework,vessel traffic conflict situation modeling,6G mobile communication,maritime Internet of Things,Artificial intelligence,spatiotemporal vessel trajectories,revolutionary communication paradigm,long-short-term memory network,Trajectory,trajectory prediction,Navigation,combined satellite-terrestrial AIS,marine vehicles,realistic AIS-based vessel trajectories,unsatisfactory maritime safety,satisfactory prediction performance,"
"permeability and voids influence on the thermal signal, as inferred by multitemporal uav-based infrared and visible images","2020","This work presents for the first time associated thermal anomalies and deformations over subsurface cavities/voids located within two harbour quays in Le Havre Harbourg, Normandy, France. An U.A.V. (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) was used to acquire visible and thermal images over a diurnal cycle (from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m.). The visible images were processed to realize an altimetric model of the platforms by mean of the photogrammetric method, while the thermal infrared (TIR) images were used to study the evolution of their surface temperatures. The obtained 3D model shows the location of five topographic depressions on both quays. The analysis of the evolution of the surface thermal field leads to the detection of cold thermal anomalies that are (1) not correlated to surface properties, and (2) spatially associated to the flanks of the five topographic depressions. Using a 2D conductive-radiative model, we show that these anomalies are not directly due to the thermally insulating effect of an air-filled area. Finally, we conclude that preferential infiltration and subsequent evaporation in the micro-fracturation present within the flanks of the depressions may be responsible for the strong cooling of these zones.","Thermal infrared,Photogrammetry,Remote Sensing,infiltration,Subsurface cavity,Natural hazards,UAV,"
"the role of sea ice formation in cycling of aluminium in northern marguerite bay, antarctica","2010","The use of dissolved Al as a tracer for oceanic water masses and atmospheric dust deposition of biologically important elements, such as iron, requires the quantitative assessment of its sources and sinks in seawater. Here, we address the relative importance of oceanic versus atmospheric inputs of Al, and the relationship with nutrient cycling, in a region of high biological productivity in coastal Antarctica. We investigate the concentrations of dissolved Al in seawater, sea ice, meteoric water and sediments collected from northern Marguerite Bay, off the West Antarctic Peninsula, from 2005 to 2006. Dissolved Al concentrations at 15 m water depth varied between 2 and 27 nM, showing a peak between two phytoplankton blooms. We find that, in this coastal setting, upwelling and incorporation of waters from below the surface mixed layer are responsible for this peak in dissolved Al as well as renewal of nutrients. This means that changes in the intensity and frequency of upwelling events may result in changes in biological production and carbon uptake. The waters below the mixed layer are most likely enriched in Al as a result of sea ice formation, either causing the injection of Al-rich brines or the resuspension of sediments and entrainment of pore fluids by brine cascades. Glacial, snow and sea ice melt contribute secondarily to the supply of Al to surface waters. Total particulate Al ranges from 93 to 2057 mg/g, and increases with meteoric water input towards the end of the summer, indicating glacial runoff is an important source of particulate Al. The (Al/Si)opal of sediment core top material is considerably higher than water column opal collected by sediment traps, indicative of a diagenetic overprint and incorporation of Al at the sediment–water interface. Opal that remains buried in the sediment could represent a significant sink of Al from seawater.","biogeochemistry,nutrients (mineral),trace metals,brines,Antarctica,"
"mercury evidence of intense submarine volcanism and hydrothermal activity during a mid-tournaisian anoxic event in the carnic alps","2022","The mid-Tournaisian Event, or Lower Alum Shale Event (LASE), is linked to severe facies changes including pelagic carbonates and widespread black siliceous shales and radiolarites in many parts of the world. For the first time, high-resolution inorganic geochemistry and framboidal pyrite analyses were applied to decipher depositional condition changes during the mid-Tournaisian event in the Carnic Alps. The predominance of tiny pyrite framboids, high Corg/P, U/Th, and V/Cr ratios, generally higher enrichments of redox-sensitive metals such as Mo, U, V, and depletion in Mn suggest anoxic/euxinic conditions at the sea bottom. Moreover, we found very large anomalous Hg spikes (with maximum values reaching 3650 ppb) for the first time in the mid-Tournaisian deep-water marine succession of the Carnic Alps. Our results suggest intense volcanism during the LASE, which triggered the mid-Tournaisian anoxic event. The most likely candidate for the observed Hg anomalous contents is submarine arc volcanism and hydrothermal activity connected with the collision of the peri-Gondwanan terranes Paleo-Adria and probably Armorican Terrane Assemblage (ATA) and/or Noric terrane during the first phase of the Variscan orogeny.","Anoxia,Organic-rich rocks,Mid-Tournaisian Event,The Lower Alum Shale Event,Mercury,Volcanism,"

"a data driven approach to assessing the reliability of using taxicab as probes for real-time route selections","2021","Taxi service is one of the most important modes for urban transportation. In recent years, many taxi companies have been routinely collecting data to track the movement of each taxi for improving security, coordination, and service performance. This paper is intended to use the GPS vehicle positioning data to assess the route choice behavior of taxi drivers and explore if the routes selected by taxi drivers can be incorporated into a traveler information system. It is often perceived that taxi drivers have the ability to select quality routes assuming that: (1) they tend to be more knowledgeable about alternative routes and time-dependent traffic conditions than general public, including some publicly available route guidance systems due to the nature of their profession; and (2) they are typically more motivated to incorporate their knowledge about traffic conditions into their route choice decisions. An experimental study is conducted to examine the validity of these two assumptions. We have developed a framework that can effectively process the data into information about routes selected by taxi drivers and their associated travel times. The performance of the routes selected by taxi drivers is compared with the performance of those recommended by e-maps. Our results indicate that the routes selected by taxi drivers are generally more efficient than the routes recommended by some major e-maps, suggesting that taxi drivers are more active in selecting routes to avoid congestion.","Data driven approach,route choice,travel time estimation,taxi service,"
"directional wave climate and power variability along the southeast australian shelf","2015","Variability in the modal wave climate is a key process driving large-scale coastal behaviour on moderate- to high-energy sandy coastlines, and is strongly related to variability in synoptic climate drivers. On sub-tropical coasts, shifts in the sub-tropical ridge (STR) modulate the seasonal occurrence of different wave types. However, in semi-enclosed seas, isolating directional wave climates and synoptic drivers is hindered by a complex mixed sea-swell environment. Here we present a directional wave climate typology for the Tasman Sea based on a combined statistical-synoptic approach using mid-shelf wave buoy observations along the Southeast Australian Shelf (SEAS). Five synoptic-scale wave climates exist during winter, and six during summer. These can be clustered into easterly (Tradewind), south-easterly (Tasman Sea) and southerly (Southern Ocean) wave types, each with distinct wave power signatures. We show that a southerly shift in the STR and trade-wind zone, consistent with an observed poleward expansion of the tropics, forces an increase in the total wave energy flux in winter for the central New South Wales shelf of 1.9GJm–1 wave-crest-length for 1° southerly shift in the STR, and a reduction of similar magnitude (approximately 1.8GJm–1) during summer. In both seasons there is an anti-clockwise rotation of wave power towards the east and south-east at the expense of southerly waves. Reduced obliquity of constructive wave power would promote a general disruption to northward alongshore sediment transport, with the cross-shore component becoming increasingly prevalent. Results are of global relevance to sub-tropical east coasts where the modal wave climate is influenced by the position of the zonal STR.","Wave climate,Cluster analysis,Wave power,Sub-tropical ridge,Tasman Sea,Southeast Australia,"
"unmanned maritime vehicles, 20 years of commercial and technical evolution","2016","Unmanned Maritime Vehicles (UMVs) have been under development, especially with US Navy research funds, for decades.

Since then many other companies have developed and delivered unmanned maritime vehicles. The transition from research topic to commercial technology has not always been easy, but it has been profound. This paper reviews both sub-component technology and UMV system developments over the past twenty years. Both unmanned undersea vehicles (UUVs) and unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) are examined. Key technology topics reviewed include: propulsion, power, positioning, telemetry, and software. Just as the technology of UMVs has evolved so too have their applications. This paper also evaluates the commercial and operational results that have made UMVs ubiquitous in ocean applications. In particular it covers: survey UUVs, buoyancy gliders, persistent and conventional USVs and inspection and intervention UUVs. This paper aims to capture the major technology and mission accomplishments of UMV manufacturers and operators over the past two decades.

"security and qos issues in blockchain enabled next-generation smart logistic networks: a tutorial","2022","The blockchain-enabled smart logistics market is expected to grow worth USD 1620 billion and at a compound annual growth rate of 62.4%. Smart logistics ensures intelligence infrastructure, logistics automation, real-time analysis of supply chain data synchronization of the logistics process, cost transparency, unbroken shipment tracking all the way down to the transportation route, etc. In the smart logistics domain, significant advancement and growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) sensors are evident. However, the connectivity of IoT systems, including Tactile Internet, without proper safeguards creates vulnerabilities that can still be deliberately or inadvertently cause disruption. In view of this, we primarily notice two key issues. Firstly, the logistics domain can be compromised by a variety of natural or man-made activities, which eventually affect the overall network security. Secondly, there are thousands of entities in the supply chain network that use extensive machine-learning algorithms in many scenarios, and they require high-power computational resources. From these two challenges, we note that the first concern can be addressed by adding blockchain to IoT logistic networks. The second issue can be addressed using 6G. This will support 1-μs latency communications, support seamless computing at the edges of networks, and autonomously predict the best optimal location for edge computing. Motivated by this, we have highlighted motivational examples to show the necessity to integrate 6G and blockchain in smart logistic networks. Then, we have proposed a 6G and blockchain-enabled smart logistic high-level framework. We have presented the key intrinsic issues of this framework mainly from the security and resource management context. In this paper, recent state-of-the-art advances in blockchain enabled next-generation smart logistic networks are analyzed. We have also examined why 6G and not 5G would be compatible with the smart network. We have introduced five different use cases of blockchain technology in smart logistics.

"real-time infrared horizon detection in maritime and land environments based on hyper-laplace filter and convolutional neural network","2023","The infrared (IR) horizon is an essential reference for near-ground state awareness and target detection. The traditional horizon detection algorithms based on hand-crafted features claim the advantage of being intuitive and highly targeted, however, their capability of detail extraction and robustness is not strong enough when switching among diverse scenes, meanwhile, the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have the powerful ability in feature acquisition, but has the disadvantages of interpretability and instability. Given this, this article proposes a novel horizon detection algorithm that combines the traditional method and CNN. First, the hyper-Laplace filter (HLF) is proposed to eliminate the interferences and enhance the saliency of the target. Then a positioning module (PM) based on the traditional idea which fully utilizes the structural characteristics of multifeature-maps in CNN is present to extract the endpoints of the horizon. Finally, an auxiliary module that consists of a revise branch (RB) and self-attention module (SAM) is designed to assist the PM with detailed corrections. Compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms, experiments based on three datasets with more than 25000 frames under various scenes demonstrate that the proposed algorithm not only achieves the best accuracy and highest stability but also addresses real-time needs. Notably, the detection deviation is controlled within 2 pixels on all three datasets while achieving a comparable detection speed of 170 frames/s.

"early 20th century warming in the arctic: a review","2011","From the 1920s to the 1940s, the Artic experienced significant warming that is comparable to the recent 30-year warming. The former warming was concentrated mostly in high latitudes, in contrast to the recent 30-year warming, which has occurred in all latitudes. Several explanations have been proposed; however, one of these proposed explanations, single external forcing, which could once explain the global average, failed to explain the early 20th century scenario. A second possible explanation was internal atmospheric variability with low frequency. Another candidate for the explanation was still forcing by black carbon deposited on snow and ice surfaces. The answer is most likely to be a combination of intrinsic internal natural climate variability and positive feedbacks that amplified the radiative and atmospheric forcing. We must continue our study by discovering historical data, analyzing ice cores, reanalyzing the Arctic system together with long-term reanalysis dating back to the 1880s, and also determine the contributions of each factor.","Early 20th century warming,Climate forcing,Internal variability,Arctic,"
"enhancing ais to improve whale-ship collision avoidance and maritime security","2009","Whale-ship strikes are of growing worldwide concern due to the steady growth of commercial shipping. Improving the current situation involves the creation of a communication capability allowing whale position information to be estimated and exchanged among vessels and other observation assets. An early example of such a system has been implemented for the shipping lane approaches to the harbor of Boston, Massachusetts where ship traffic transits areas of the Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary frequently used by whales. It uses the Automated Identification Systems (AIS) technology, currently required for larger vessels but becoming more common in all classes of vessels. However, we believe the default mode of AIS operation will be inadequate to meet the long-term needs of whale-ship collision avoidance, and will likewise fall short of meeting other current and future marine safety and security communication needs. This paper explores the emerging safety and security needs for vessel communications, and considers the consequences of a communication framework supporting asynchronous messaging that can be used to enhance the basic AIS capability. The options we analyze can be pursued within the AIS standardization process, or independently developed with attention to compatibility with existing AIS systems. Examples are discussed for minimizing ship interactions with Humpback Whales and endangered North Atlantic Right Whales on the east coast, and North Pacific Right Whales, Bowhead Whales, Humpback Whales, Blue Whales and Beluga Whales in west coast, Alaskan and Hawaiian waters.","marine accidents,North Atlantic right Whales,Whale-ship collision avoidance,Communication system security,Standardization,Marine vehicles,vessel communications,maritime security,Sea measurements,Whale position information,AIS technology,Humpback Whales,ships,marine safety,marine engineering,Collision avoidance,Oceans,Beluga Whales,Boston,automated identification systems technology,North Pacific Right Whales,Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary,Economic forecasting,AIS enhancement,Marine technology,Bowhead Whales,Marine safety,Massachusetts,collision avoidance,Blue Whales,Whales,"
"the vöhrum section (northwest germany) and the aptian/albian boundary","2003","Prior to 1947, the Aptian/Albian boundary was placed at the base of the Nolaniceras nolani ammonite Zone. From (Trav. Lab. Géol. Fac. Sci. 26 (1947) 17), until (Cret. Res. 20 (1999) 609), the base of the Albian stage has been taken at the first appearance of the ammonite Leymeriella (Proleymeriella) schrammeni, a species known only from a limited area of northwest Germany. The early succession of Leymeriella and its relationship with ammonite taxa from the underlying Hypacanthoplites jacobi ammonite Zone can only be determined in the northwest German sections, all of which are ephemeral clay pits. Thus, the definition of the base of the Albian on these criteria cannot be used in a global context. The positioning of the boundary has been the subject of intense discussion in the last years. After the second International Symposium on Cretaceous Stage Boundaries in 1995 (Bull. Inst. R. Sci. Nat. Belgique, Sci. Terre 66 (1996) 45). (Cret. Res. 20 (1999) 609) lowered the boundary to the base of his Hypacanthoplites rubricosus ammonite Subzone without describing a global boundary stratotype section. (Cret. Res. 21 (2000) 591) raised the boundary to the alleged first occurrence (FO) of Leymeriella tardefurcata in a permanent section, but neither proposals can be accepted globally (Cret. Res. 23 (2002) 1). (Cret. Res. 22 (2001) 677) supported by (Cret. Res. 23 (2002) 1), suggested a radical solution by raising the boundary to the base of the geographically widespread Lyelliceras lyelli ammonite Subzone, currently the base of the Middle Albian.

"method of measuring doppler shift of moving targets using fmcw maritime radar","2013","During the operation of an FMCW (frequency modulated continuous wave) maritime radar, the system transmits a continuous radio energy with a frequency modulated by a triangular or sawtooth-shaped signal. As a result, the frequency of the transmitted signal varies gradually with time. When the signal is reflected by an object, the received waveform will build up a delayed replica of the transmitted waveform, with the time delay as a measure of the target range. If the target is moving, the radar system will register a Doppler shift within the received signal. Compared to the frequency of the emitted signal, the received signal will show a higher frequency when the target is approaching and a lower frequency when the target is moving away from the radar location. Thus, the total Doppler shift may result from the superposition of both source and observer motions. Specifically, the amount of Doppler shift is directly proportional to the radial speed of the target. The Doppler shift can be determined after performing the range Fourier transform (range FFT) first. For a target of interest, we can repeat the range FFT until we have enough data to perform the second level of FFT. The result of this second FFT is a two dimensional complex valued matrix, whose spectral peak corresponds to the Doppler shift of the moving target. This method is known as Doppler FFT. Some results of the measurement of target speed using this method are presented in this paper.","range Fourier transform,FMCW maritime radar,marine radar,moving targets,sawtooth-shaped signal,Radar antennas,two dimensional complex valued matrix,FMCW,CW radar,frequency modulation,fast Fourier transforms,triangular-shaped signal,frequency modulated continuous wave maritime radar,computer simulation,range FFT,radar,radial speed,Doppler shift measurement,target speed measurement,Doppler FFT,FM radar,Radar cross-sections,continuous radio energy,Doppler shift,Frequency modulation,Doppler radar,velocity measurement,"
"prospects and challenges in unlocking natural-gas-hydrate energy in india: recent advancements","2022","Natural gas hydrate deposits hold huge potential as a future energy resource of the world including India. To help realize these resources, India carried out two dedicated research expeditions (NGHP-01 and 02) to identify, characterize and analyze natural gas hydrate resource potential in its maritime boundaries. This work presents a review of the current status of research and development activities in the area of natural gas hydrate systems in India taking a cue from the NGHP-02 research findings. The NGHP-02 is considered one of the most extensive research programs to date for drilling and pressure core collection. This program resulted in minimally disturbed and well-preserved core samples collected from pressure-coring. Logging while drilling, wireline logging, formation pressure testing, vertical seismic profiling, and pressure core analysis confirmed one of the highly saturated (~40%–100%), sand-based, hydrate accumulation in three ultradeep locations, Area B, C, and E, eastern offshore India. The shipborne evaluation helped in the collection of the most suitable core samples to perform the first-ever comprehensive post-cruise triaxial testing, to obtain key petrophysical and geomechanical properties of interest. Further, a suitably designed experimental strategy helped to collect multiple sets of data from utilizing a lesser number of pressure core samples. The most prominent experiments included drained-undrained consolidation and compression, multistage compression and consolidation, alternating strain-rate compression, and permeability evaluation tests. The seal overlying hydrate layer are primarily made of clay rich sediments. The permeability measurements findings of the tested samples were reported in the range of 0.01 to tens of mD depending upon hydrate saturation, sand particle distribution, and range of applied effective stress. Significant permeability loss (∼90%) with increasing effective stress (up to 10 MPa) was noted. Further, permeability anisotropy, a ratio of horizontal to vertical permeability = 4, is reported to be consistent with the values reported for other marine hydrate-bearing sediments. The geochemical analysis put the natural gas to be primarily composed of methane mostly from microbial sources however part contribution from deeper sources was not ruled out. Moreover, numerical modeling of sand migration, thermal characterization, hydrate morphology, and extensive reservoir simulations was also used to obtain greater insight into the nature of the hydrate deposition system and its resource potential. Hydrate occurrences in an ultradeep and shallow subseafloor environment, such as those found in the Krishna-Godavari basin, pose challenge to well bore stability and sustained gas production due to the combined effect of high-pressure drawdown and hydrate dissociation induced strength loss and sand migration. Hence, incorporation of a coupled flow, geomechanical and sand migration analysis in well bore stability and reservoir simulation are suggested as a way forward. The NGHP-02 program and its findings not only advance India's endeavor to locally produce natural gas from these unconventional resources but also provides valuable information concerning exploitation of other marine gas hydrate accumulations found elsewhere in the world.","Gas hydrate reservoir,Logging while drilling,Seismic profile,Pressure core,Reservoir simulation,Geomechanical properties,Krishna-Godavari basin,"
"environment-aware coverage optimization for space-ground integrated maritime communications","2020","To satisfy the growing demand for broadband maritime communications, space-ground integrated maritime communication networks (MCNs) arise, which are envisioned to take full advantage of both satellites and terrestrial shore-based networks. In practice, due to the frequent beam hopping of satellites and the limited number of geographically available onshore base-station sites, the space-ground integrated MCN usually presents a highly non-cellular network structure, leading to both challenging blind zones and coverage areas with severe interference. In this paper, we optimize the coverage performance by exploiting the marine environment information. Particularly, the transmit antenna correlation is estimated using the location and mobility information of scatterers on the sea, such as lighthouses, reefs, islands, and vessels. The position and attitude information of satellites are also utilized for interference estimation. Based on that, we optimize the input covariance and precoding matrix to maximize the ergodic sum capacity for all mobile terminals within the coverage. It is a complicated non-convex problem, especially because the ergodic sum capacity is difficult to be expressed straightly without the expectation operator. We introduce an upper bound of the ergodic sum capacity using the path loss and the transmit antenna correlation estimated from the environment information, and then propose an iterative algorithm to solve the problem by solving a set of convex subproblems. The proposed environment-aware scheme is evaluated using the real-world geographic information of a coastal area of China. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can greatly improve the ergodic sum capacity and the energy efficiency compared with existing approaches, and achieve dynamic coverage to match the non-cellular network structure.","Satellites,complicated nonconvex problem,ergodic sum capacity maximization,space-ground integrated MCN,Antenna arrays,matrix algebra,input covariance optimization,convex programming,path loss,non-cellular,environment-aware coverage optimization,Transmitting antennas,concave programming,coverage performance optimization,beam hopping,space-ground integrated maritime communications,dynamic coverage,environment-aware scheme,precoding matrix,scatterer mobility information,precoding,Maritime communications,broadband maritime communications,Propagation losses,satellite-based networks,real-world geographic information,Correlation,radiofrequency interference,terrestrial shore-based networks,coverage optimization,transmitting antennas,satellite antennas,iterative methods,noncellular network structure,Optimization,onshore base-station sites,broadband networks,marine environment information,marine communication,attitude information,interference estimation,upper bound,transmit antenna correlation,Interference,iterative algorithm,mobile terminals,energy efficiency,"

"operational active fire mapping and burnt area identification applicable to mexican nature protection areas using modis and noaa-avhrr direct readout data","2009","Since 1999, the National Commission for the Knowledge and Use of the Biodiversity (CONABIO) in Mexico has been developing and managing the “Operational program for the detection of hot-spots using remote sensing techniques”. This program uses images from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard the Terra and Aqua satellites and from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA-AVHRR), which are operationally received through the Direct Readout station (DR) at CONABIO. This allows the near-real time monitoring of fire events in Mexico and Central America. In addition to the detection of active fires, the location of hot spots are classified with respect to vegetation types, accessibility, and risk to Nature Protection Areas (NPA). Besides the fast detection of fires, further analysis is necessary due to the considerable effects of forest fires on biodiversity and human life. This fire impact assessment is crucial to support the needs of resource managers and policy makers for adequate fire recovery and restoration actions. CONABIO attempts to meet these requirements, providing post-fire assessment products as part of the management system in particular for satellite-based burnt area mapping. This paper provides an overview of the main components of the operational system and will present an outlook to future activities and system improvements, especially the development of a burnt area product. A special focus will also be placed on the fire occurrence within NPAs of Mexico.","Direct readout,Active fire mapping,Burnt area,NOAA-AVHRR,Mexico,Nature protection area,MODIS,"

"asynchronous trajectory matching-based multimodal maritime data fusion for vessel traffic surveillance in inland waterways","2023","The automatic identification system (AIS) and video cameras have been widely exploited for vessel traffic surveillance in inland waterways. The AIS data could provide vessel identity and dynamic information on vessel position and movements. In contrast, the video data could describe the visual appearances of moving vessels without knowing the information on identity, position, movements, etc. To further improve vessel traffic surveillance, it becomes necessary to fuse the AIS and video data to simultaneously capture the visual features, identity, and dynamic information for the vessels of interest. However, the performance of AIS and video data fusion is susceptible to issues such as data spatial difference, message asynchronous transmission, visual object occlusion, etc. In this work, we propose a deep learning-based simple online and real-time vessel data fusion method (termed DeepSORVF). We first extract the AIS-and video-based vessel trajectories, and then propose an asynchronous trajectory matching method to fuse the AIS-based vessel information with the corresponding visual targets. In addition, by combining the AIS-and video-based movement features, we also present a prior knowledge-driven anti-occlusion method to yield accurate and robust vessel tracking results under occlusion conditions. To validate the efficacy of our DeepSORVF, we have also constructed a new benchmark dataset (termed FVessel) for vessel detection, tracking, and data fusion. It consists of many videos and the corresponding AIS data collected in various weather conditions and locations. The experimental results have demonstrated that our method is capable of guaranteeing high-reliable data fusion and anti-occlusion vessel tracking. The DeepSORVF code and FVessel dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/gy65896/DeepSORVF and https://github.com/gy65896/FVessel, respectively.","Trajectory,deep neural network,anti-occlusion tracking,Visualization,Radar tracking,Object detection,vessel traffic surveillance,Artificial intelligence,Inland waterways,Surveillance,Data integration,data fusion,"

"satellite multicast transmission scheme in integrated satellite-maritime networks","2020","This paper proposes a maritime transmission scheme in integrated satellite-maritime networks, where the satellite multicast and relay cooperation cooperatively provide the ubiquitous broadband coverage for the whole sea area. Under the proposed network, the maritime users that request the same content or belong to the same fleet can be divided into one user group. Besides, the satellite provides multicast services for the all user groups, while the relay nodes retransmit the signal to other users to reduce the satellite communication cost of user group. However, since the network performance is strongly correlated with satellite links and relay nodes, it is difficult to find out the optimal cooperation solution with low complexity. Meanwhile, the user groups work in the same carrier frequency, which inevitably causes the co-channel interferences among groups. Considering these factors, we propose a cooperative access and power allocation algorithms, respectively. The cooperative access algorithm is based on channel quality and considers the channel quality of satellite and relay node simultaneously. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme can effective improve system performance compared with existing scheme.","Satellites,multicast communication,satellite communication cost reduction,Resource management,ubiquitous broadband coverage,satellite-maritime networks,maritime transmission scheme,cooperative access algorithm,Relays,power allocation,relay node,signal retransmission,access selection,optimal cooperation solution,relay networks (telecommunication),Satellite broadcasting,cochannel interferences,power allocation algorithm,Optimization,maritime users,integrated satellite-maritime networks,satellite links,cooperative communication,marine communication,Multicast,multicast services,cochannel interference,Signal to noise ratio,relay cooperation,Interference,satellite multicast transmission scheme,resource allocation,user group,"
"genetic structure among breeding herring gulls (larus argentatus) from the great lakes and eastern canada","1999","Herring gulls (Larus argentatus) have been used as sentinel species for exposure to toxic chemicals since the 1960s. Reference populations in these studies have never been characterized to determine whether genetic differences might explain some of the effects seen in gulls at contaminated locations. Previously it was shown that there were higher rates of germline minisatellite DNA mutation rates in herring gulls colonizing sites located near steel industries in urban areas in the Great Lakes. It was suggested that population substructuring among gull colonies could account for differences in the mutation rates observed as a result of surveying different minisatellite loci. Here this explanation is dismissed by showing that genetic exchange among herring gull populations within the Great Lakes appears to be sufficient to ensure genetic homogeneity of these populations; in contrast, differences exist at the minisatellite loci scored between the gulls in the Great Lakes and the Maritimes. It is suggested that reference samples for future Great Lakes herring gull studies be selected from within the Great Lakes, and that potential genetic divergence from Maritime gulls should be investigated in more detail.","Minisatellite DNA,genetic toxicology,Great Lakes,population genetics,herring gull,"
"temporal-spatio evolution of maritime accidents","2023","As an important passage connecting China with Southeast Asia, South Asia and the Middle East, the South China Sea has an important geopolitical and economic strategic position.

It is concluded that the hot spots of accidents in the South China Sea are mainly distributed in several important ports and coastal areas of the South China Sea, showing an obvious spatial clustering phenomenon. Meanwhile, combined with the time evolution of the past 40 years, this paper analyzes the spatio-temporal evolution of maritime accidents in the South China Sea, evaluates the risk of different maritime accidents and proposes corresponding prevention strategies, including strengthening supervision, conducting operation and technical training for sailors, using digital system to manage cargo and improving information sharing mechanism to promote cooperation among neighboring countries.

"“mystify”: a proactive moving-target defense for a resilient sdn controller in software defined cps","2022","The recent devastating mission Cyber–Physical System (CPS) attacks, failures, and the desperate need to scale and to dynamically adapt to changes, revolutionized traditional CPS to what we name as Software Defined CPS (SD-CPS). SD-CPS embraces the concept of Software Defined (SD) everything where CPS infrastructure is more elastic, dynamically adaptable and online-programmable. However, in SD-CPS, the threat became more immanent, as the long-been physically-protected assets are now programmatically accessible to cyber attackers. In SD-CPSs, a network failure hinders the entire functionality of the system. In this paper, we present MystifY, a spatiotemporal runtime diversification for Moving-Target Defense (MTD) to secure the SD-CPS infrastructure. In this paper, we relied on Smart Grid networks as crucial SD-CPS application to evaluate our presented solution. MystifY’s MTD relies on a set of pillars to ensure the SDN controller resiliency against failures and attacks. The 1st pillar is a grid-aware algorithm that optimally allocates the most suitable controller–deployment​ location in large-scale grids. The 2nd pillar is a special diversifier that dynamically relocates the controller between heterogeneously configured hosts to avoid host-based attacks. The 3rd pillar is a temporal diversifier that dynamically detours controller–workload between multiple controllers to enhance their reliability and to detect and avoid controller intrusions. Our experimental results showed the efficiency and effectiveness of the presented approach.","Network security,Smart grid,CPP,MTD,SDN,CPC,"
"one-dimensional spectral analysis of aeromagnetic data from temiscouata area and the western sector of the gulf of st. lawrence","1979","1-D spectral analysis is useful to determine the mean depths to buried magnetic Precambrian basement rocks. The average thickness of the sedimentary cover which may contain favourable petroleum reservoirs overlying the basement of the Northern Appalachians of Quebec was determined by this method. Additional information related to structural geology of the basement and the sedimentary cover can also be obtained with this technique. The center of the Temiscouata area is located at longitude 69° W and latitude 47° 45′ N and the one of the Gulf at 67° 45′ W and 49° 05′ N. The aeromagnetic data were digitized from the 1 mile = 1 inch total field contour maps published by EMR. In the digitization process, the magnetic intensities were read on contour lines only. Interpolation at fixed intervals were calculated with the help of a computer program subroutine. The fixed intervals were chosen at 0.25, 0.50 on shore and 1.00 mile offshore in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. The magnetic gradient was removed using the IGRF formula or numerical filters. The least square method was avoided because of the biasing it involves. Additional smoothing was occasionally done. After these different steps were executed, the transformation to obtain the Fourier co-efficients was carried out using an algorithm for computing the Mixed Radix Fast Fourier Transform. Mean depths are then calculated from the energy spectra; this constitutes a statistical approach. The mean depths obtained from the 1-D energy spectrum are comparable within 10–15% with the ones obtained from the 2-D energy spectrum. 1-D spectral analysis of AM data offers some advantages on the 2-D counterpart. Among these, we can mention the eventuality of obtaining mean depths to the basement from the analysis of only a few AM flight lines in a new area and of detailing more accurately structural features of local nature in the basement. Such structural features may be controlling agents in eventual reservoirs within the sedimentary rocks.",""
"response strategies of the main forest types to climatic anomalies across croatian biogeographic regions inferred from fapar remote sensing data","2014","Croatia is positioned in the transitional zone of South-eastern Europe and the Mediterranean, a region with frequent occurrence of severe droughts and dry spells, which makes it particularly vulnerable to the impact of climate change. It distends across three main European biogeographical regions – Continental, Alpine and Mediterranean – and therefore has a very high level of forest diversity comprised of 11 out of 14 European forest types. This makes it very convenient to study the exposure of main European forest types to extreme climatic events in the southern limits of their species distribution range. This study provides an assessment of responses of forest vegetation under episodes of climatic anomalies consisting of the most severe historical dry and warm spells in 2000 and 2003, together with the extremely rainy season in 2005 across Croatian territory. The question of interest in this study was to reveal how the existing forest types across the territorial gradient respond to highly expressed extreme climatic variations and to infer some clues about related adaptive strategies. The regional scale approach was applied which previously performed structural delineation of forest cover into eleven main forest groups or bioclimates and were examined considering functional differences. Responses of eleven bioclimatic types were analyzed by time series (1998–2005) of monthly FAPAR (The Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetic Active Radiation) coverage with a spatial resolution of 1.2km, freely available from JRC FAPAR project. To quantify and differentiate the vegetation response in the considered years we adopted indices of resilience (resistance, recovery, resilience and relative resilience). We also provided a modified approach by applying these indices on a seasonal scale to examine the relationship between variations of phenology and ecosystem responses. The results confirmed the modification of seasonality of photosynthetic activity in relation to the altitudinal and spatial gradient. At the intra-seasonal scale, we distinguished specific opportunistic behavior of the common beech and oak forest types to alternating climatic conditions. Beech forest types show a very high ability to shift their phenology to earlier spring warming as a consequence of global warming. However, continental and Mediterranean oak forest types and in particular Aleppo pine and holm oak forests showed a higher increase of FAPAR during rainy events. The revealed capability of some tree species to better exploit rainfall in very wet periodic episodes has to be further evaluated in drawing conclusions about the overall resilience of forests under future climate change scenarios.","Extreme climatic events,Forest resilience,Climate change impacts,Land surface phenology,Forest responses,Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR),"
"hourly composition of gas and particle phase pollutants at a central urban background site in milan, italy","2017","A comprehensive range of gas and particle phase pollutants were sampled at 1-hour time resolution in urban background Milan during summer 2012. Measurements include several soluble inorganic aerosols (Cl−,NO2−,NO3−,SO42−,Ca2+,K+,Mg2+,Na+,NH4+) and gases (HCl, HNO2,HNO3, NH3, NO, NO2,O3, SO2), organic, elemental and black carbon and meteorological parameters. Analysis methods used include mean diurnal pattern on weekdays and Sundays, pollution roses, bivariate polar plots and statistical models using backtrajectories. Results show how nitrous acid (HONO) was mainly formed heterogeneously at nighttime, with a dependence of its formation rate on NO2 consistent with observations during the last HONO campaign in Milan in summer 1998, although since 1998 a drop in HONO levels occurred following to the decrease of its precursors. Nitrate showed two main formation mechanisms: one occurring through N2O5 at nighttime and leading to nitrate formation onto existing particles; another occurring both daytime and nighttime following the homogeneous reaction of ammonia gas with nitric acid gas. Air masses reaching Milan influenced nitrate formation depending on their content in ammonia and the timing of arrival. Notwithstanding the low level of SO2 in Milan, its peaks were associated to point source emissions in the Po valley or shipping and power plant emissions SW of Milan, beyond the Apennines. A distinctive pattern for HCl was observed, featured by an afternoon peak and a morning minimum, and best correlated to atmospheric temperature, although it was not possible to identify any specific source. The ratio of primary-dominated organic carbon and elemental carbon on hourly PM2.5 resulted 1.7. Black carbon was highly correlated to elemental carbon and the average mass absorption coefficient resulted MAC=13.8 ± 0.2 m2 g−1. It is noteworthy how air quality for a large metropolitan area, in a confined valley and under enduring atmospheric stability, is nonetheless influenced by sources within and outside the valley.","Gas-phase pollutants,Po valley,PM,Hourly ionic composition,"
"rare earth and trace elements of microbialites in upper jurassic coral- and sponge-microbialite reefs","2006","Major, trace (Y, Zr, Pb, Th and U), rare earth element (REE) and Sm–Nd isotope analyses were carried out on microbialites and detrital carbonate sediments collected in Upper Jurassic coral- and sponge-microbialite reef settings. Selected bioconstructions developed in various palaeogeographic settings and depositional environments on northwestern Tethys and eastern Atlantic margins: pure carbonate lagoon, carbonate-dominated deep shelf to epicontinental basin and mixed carbonate-siliciclastic shallow ramp and lagoon. The proximity to terrigenous sources directly controlled REE patterns of carbonate samples. Lateral and intra-reef sediments, and to a lesser degree stromatolitic microbial crusts, are more susceptible to contamination by terrigenous material than are microbialites of thrombolitic fabric. In mixed carbonate-siliciclastic settings, microbialites display a flat shale-normalized REE pattern. In pure carbonate lagoonal settings, microbialites have shale-normalized REE patterns similar to those of modern seawaters with a negative Ce anomaly [(Ce/Ce⁎) up to 0.14], positive La and Gd anomalies, and light REE depletion relative to heavy REE. These data imply that similar REE chemistry than modern seawater already occurred on the northwestern Tethys margin at the Upper Jurassic. Strong negative Ce anomalies (<0.4) imply microbialite formation in well-oxygenated seawaters both in coral reefs of pure carbonate lagoonal environments (Pagny-sur-Meuse) and sponge bioherms of deep-shelf settings (Plettenberg). Absence of positive Ce anomalies rules out an influence of alkaline and high-pH seawaters. Thus, REE patterns and Nd isotopic signatures, which are in perfect agreement with existing results for Tethysian seawater, confirm that microbialites can be used as proxies of palaeoenvironmental seawater chemical characteristics.","Rare earth elements,Coral and sponge reefs,Microbialites,Nd isotopes,Upper Jurassic seawater,Palaeoenvironment,"
"variability and propagation of labrador sea water in the southern subpolar north atlantic","2009","The variability of two modes of Labrador Sea Water (LSW) (upper and deep Labrador Sea Water) and their respective spreading in the interior North Atlantic Ocean are investigated by means of repeated ship surveys carried out along the zonal WOCE line A2/AR19 located at 43–48°N (1993–2007) and along the GOOS line at about 48–51°N (1997–2002). Hydrographic section data are complemented by temperature, salinity, and velocity time series recorded by two moorings. They have been deployed at the western flank of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR) in the Newfoundland Basin during 1996–2004. The analysis of hydrographic anomalies at various longitudes points to a gradual eastward propagation of LSW-related signals, which happens on time scales of 3–6 years from the formation region towards the MAR. Interactions of the North Atlantic Current (NAC) with the Deep Western Boundary Current (DWBC) close to Flemish Cap point to the NAC being the main distributor of the different types of LSW into the interior of the Newfoundland Basin. Comparisons between the ship data and the mooring records revealed that the mooring sites are located in a region affected by highly variable flow. The mooring time series demonstrate an elevated level of variability with eddy activity and variability associated with the NAC considerably influencing the LSW signals in this region. Hydrographic data taken from Argo profiles from the vicinity of the mooring sites turned out to mimic quite well the temporal evolution captured by the moorings. There is some indication of occasional southward flow in the LSW layer near the MAR. If this can be considered as a hint to an interior LSW-route, it is at least of minor importance in comparison to the DWBC. It acts as an important supplier for the interior North Atlantic, distributing older and recently formed LSW modes southward along the MAR.","Water mass spreading,Subpolar North Atlantic,Mid-Atlantic Ridge,Ocean circulation,Labrador Sea Water,"
"enabling the maritime internet of things: coap and 6lowpan performance over vhf links","2018","The dissemination of digital devices across the seas and oceans of the world is becoming a reality, laying the foundations for sophisticated operations such as autonomous shipping or exposed fish-farming. This reflects the importance of maritime regions as well as the growing demand for more data and knowledge in these remote areas. Currently, the presence of information and communication technologies (ICTs) in offshore settings is limited by the lack of infrastructures, with communications being typically decoupled from the standard Internet or relying on expensive satellite solutions. This paper proposes integrating a commonly available maritime radio-technology, namely very high frequency (VHF) communications, with protocols used in the Internet of Things (IoT). By using the Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) over a low-power wireless personal area networks and the constrained application protocol (CoAP), interoperability is ensured between already existing maritime systems and the Internet. An experimental setup is evaluated under different settings and using different configurations. In addition, an analytical assessment of the solutionsâ€™ reliability is presented. The obtained results prove the feasibility of using IoT protocols over a VHF link and demonstrate that such an approach outperforms IPv4-based solutions. The conducted assessment reveals that, in constrained settings, configurations at the application layer (e.g., CoAPâ€™s block size in Block-wise transfers) strongly impact the overall performance and reliability of the system. This motivates the development of new maritime solutions based on IPv6 for ensuring a sustainable and ubiquitous development of ICTs even in the most remote locations.","Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) over a low-power wireless personal area networks (6LoWPANs),IP fragmentation,very high frequency (VHF) devices,Protocols,Personal area networks,IP networks,maritime communication,Internet of Things (IoT),Low-power electronics,Internet of Things,Computer network reliability,Wireless personal area networks,"

"the last millennium viewed from a fine-resolution freshwater diatom record from northwestern patagonia","2022","Little is known about the response of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems to changes in climatic and human influences during the last millennium in northwestern Patagonia (NWP, 40°-44°S).

To date, however, very few fossils diatom studies have examined in detail the environmental evolution during the last millennium throughout Patagonia. Here we present a fine-resolution diatom record from a lake-sediment core collected from Lago Pichilaguna (41°S), a closed-basin and shallow lake with a small catchment area located in the lowlands of the Chilean Lake District in NWP. The record spans the last millennium with a median time resolution of ∼12 years between samples, and shows abundant small Aulacoseira spp. between ∼1000-900 and ∼600-300 cal yr BP, which alternate in dominance with small fragilarioids and small raphid diatoms between ∼900-600 and ∼300-200 cal yr BP. A rapid shift to planktonic diatoms started at ∼200 cal yr BP and led to their modern dominance. We interpret centennial-scale changes in temperature, precipitation, and lake turbulence, with warm/dry/stratified phases between ∼1000-900 and ∼600-300 cal yr BP related to weak westerly winds, and intervals of cold/wet and mixed water column conditions between ∼900-600 and ∼300-200 cal yr BP, favored by stronger winds. The transition from periphytic to planktonic diatoms that started at ∼200 cal yr BP suggests juxtaposition of the warmest/driest phase of the last millennium and the onset of large-scale disturbance by Chilean/European settlers in NWP. Our results reveal that human disturbance during historical time surpassed the natural ranges of variability and resilience of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems over the last millennium, generating abrupt changes in biodiversity, species composition, and community structure.","Lake sediment cores,Southern westerly winds,Periphyton,Planktonic diatoms,Northwestern Patagonia,Tychoplanktonic diatoms,"
"ship arrival prediction and its value on daily container terminal operation","2018","Effective prediction of ship arrivals should provide the estimated delay or advance of arrival ships with greater accuracy, and improve the performance of container terminal operations. Therefore, taking Gangji (Yining) Container Terminal (GYCT), China, as an example, this paper resorts to data mining approaches to predict ship arrivals and explore the value of such predicted ship arrivals on the container terminal operation. First, this study applies three data mining approaches, including Back-Propagation network (BP), Classification and Regression Tree (CART) and Random Forest (RF), to estimate the delay or advance of ship arrivals using the collected data of ship arrivals. Then the predictive performance of these three approaches is compared and discussed, it is concluded that RF performs better than BP and CART, and ETA month and ship length are the most important determinants of ship arrivals in GYCT terminal. Finally, series simulation experiments are conducted to assess the value of the ship arrivals predicted by RF model on the improvement on daily operation planning of berth allocation and quay crane assignment in the GYCT terminal. And the results show that incorporating the predicted ship arrivals by RF model is beneficial to improve the performance of operation planning of GYCT terminal.","Late/early arrivals,Berth allocation,Data mining,Arrival prediction,Container terminal operation,Quay crane assignment,"
"stenet: a hybrid spatio-temporal embedding network for human trajectory forecasting","2021","In this paper, we present a hybrid spatio-temporal embedding network (named as STENet) for human trajectory forecasting, which is built upon a GAN-based hierarchical framework. Differently from traditional approaches that only use LSTM for trajectory modeling, we exploit the 1D Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN) to embed position features at multiple temporal scales. Moreover, we propose a two-stage graph attention mechanism, which can better describe mutual interactions among pedestrians in the crowd. Additionally, group influences at every time step are taken into account as well. The overall framework is designed using a hierarchical manner, and trained using the Wasserstein distance. We carry out our experiments on the ETH and the UCY datasets. The corresponding results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.","Hierarchical structure,Trajectory forecasting,Graph attention mechanism,Wasserstein distance,Pedestrian grouping strategy,1D-CNN,"
"mobility pattern analysis of ship trajectories based on semantic transformation and topic model","2020","Recognition and understanding of ship mobility pattern have great significance for intelligent maritime applications, i.e. route discovery and anomaly detection. Besides a number of pattern discovery techniques currently derived from ship trajectory, topic modeling popular in the field of Natural Language Processing may provide a novel way to detect implicit patters underlying massive ship trajectories treated as documents. This paper is motivated to apply a semantic analysis method to explore potential mobility patterns from ship trajectories in inland river by combining semantic transformation and topic model. A coarse-grained semantic transformation model is firstly defined to translate each ship trajectory into a document containing a series of sequential motion words. A motion word is generally a synthetic semantic representation of three trajectory features (location, course and speed). All ship trajectories can then be examined and analyzed as a document corpus. A classic topic model (i.e. Latent Dirichlet Allocation, LDA) is employed to explore hidden ship mobility patterns from trajectory document corpus. The effectiveness of this approach is illustrated through a case study at Wuhan waterway, located at middle stream of Yangtze River in China.","Ship mobility pattern,Trajectory analysis,Topic modeling,Automatic identification system,"
"effective and efficient pixel-level detection for diverse video copy-move forgery types","2022","Video copy-move forgery detection (VCMFD) is a significant and greatly challenging task due to a variety of difficulties, including a huge amount of video information, diverse forgery types, rich forgery objects, and homogenous forgery sources. These difficulties raise four unresolved key challenges in VCMFD: i) ineffective detection in some popular forgery cases; ii) inefficient matching in processing numerous video pixels with hundred-dimensional features under dozens of matching iterations; iii) high false positive (FP) in detecting forgery videos; iv) low trade-off of efficiency and effectiveness in filling forgery region, and even failing in indicating forgeries at the pixel level. In this paper, a novel VCMFD method is proposed to address these issues: i) an innovatively improved SIFT structure that can address the thorough feature extraction in all video copy-move forgery cases; ii) a novel fast keypoint-label matching (FKLM) algorithm is proposed that creates some keypoint-label groups so that every high-dimensional feature is assigned into one of these groups. As a result, matching of video pixels can be directly done on a small number of keypoint-label groups only, leading to a nearly 500% raise in matching efficiency; iii) a new coarse-to-fine filtering relying on intrinsic attributes of exact keypoint-matches is designed to more effectively reduce the false keypoint-matches; iv) the adaptive block filling relying on true keypoint-matches contributes to the accurate and efficient suspicious region filling, even at the pixel level. Finally, the suspicious region locations with the forgery vision persistence concept indicate forgery videos. Compared to the state-of-art methods, the experiments show that our proposed method achieves the best detection accuracy, lowest FP, and improved at least 16% and 8% of F1 scores on the GRIP 2.0 dataset and a combination of SULFA 2.0 & REWIND datasets. Furthermore, the proposed method is with low computational time (4.45 s/Mpixels), which is about 1/2-1/3 times of the latest DFMI-BM (8.02 s/Mpixels) and PM-2D (13.1 s/Mpixels) methods.","Video copy-move forgery detection,Fast keypoint-label matching,Adaptive block filling,Thorough feature extraction,Coarse-to-fine filtering,"
"environmental impact of disposal of coal mining wastes on soils and plants in rostov oblast, russia","2018","Underground coal mining in Southern European Russia leads to soil cover destruction in areas directly occupied by spoil tips and rock dumps located nearby. Coal producing areas in Rostov Oblast were selected for a detailed consideration. Soil samples were taken from the uppermost horizons: a layer of 0–10cm of spoil tips and surrounding areas, as well as from 1.5m depth vertical soil profiles. The soil samples were analysed for mineral composition, particle-size distribution and gross contents of Cu, Zn, Pb, Ag, Sn, Mo, Ba, Co, Ni, Mn, Ti, V, Cr, Ga, P, Li, Sr, Y, Yb, Nb, Sc and Zr, using emission spectral analysis. The plant species of mining influenced areas were described. The process of Technosol formation at the waste sites was considered separately. Soils have not yet formed as a result of a self-restoration on the spoil tips aged more than 50years and burnt-out decades ago. A vegetation cover, which emerged during this time range, practically does not support the progress of any considerable soil-forming process. The ponds formed by the flooding of burning spoil tips, do not give the possibility for the formation of soils and hardly contribute to plant growth. The surface layers of spoil tips at all stages of their development are different from the surrounding steppe soils in geochemical characteristics and mineralogical composition. The atmospheric and water inflow of material from spoil tips changes (in the cases studied - worsens) a state of steppe soils within a radius of 1 km, and leads to the increase of heavy metal content in these soils.","Geochemical impact assessment,Heavy metals,Technogenic anomalies,Soil pollution,"
"malicious ais spoofing and abnormal stealth deviations: a comprehensive statistical framework for maritime anomaly detection","2021","The automatic identification system (AIS) is an essential and economical equipment for collision avoidance and maritime surveillance. However, AIS can be subject to intentional reporting of false information, or â€œspoofingâ€. This article assumes the vessel trajectory nominally follows a piecewise mean-reverting process; thereby, it addresses the problem of establishing whether a vessel is reporting adulterated position information through AIS messages in order to hide its current planned route and a possible deviation from the nominal route. Multiple hypothesis testing suggests a framework to enlist reliable information from monitoring systems (coastal radars and space-born satellite sensors) in support of detection of anomalies, spoofing, and stealth deviations. The proposed solution involves the derivation of anomaly detection rules based on the generalized likelihood ratio test and the model-order selection methodologies. The effectiveness of the proposed anomaly detection strategy is tested for different case studies within an operational scenario with simulated data.","Ornsteinâ€“Uhlenbeck (OU) process,surveillance,maximum likelihood estimation,generalized likelihood ratio test,Automatic identification system (AIS),model-order selection (MOS),monitoring systems,AIS messages,security of data,maritime security,maritime situational awareness,target tracking,statistical analysis,vessel trajectory,model-order selection methodologies,Testing,automatic identification system,marine engineering,maritime surveillance,Data models,data spoofing,abnormal stealth deviations,Radar tracking,multiple hypothesis testing,Artificial intelligence,maritime anomaly detection,coastal radars,Radar,statistical framework,piecewise mean-reverting process,Trajectory,multiple statistical hypothesis test,space-born satellite sensors,Surveillance,collision avoidance,malicious AIS spoofing,"
"observation needs for climate information, prediction and application: capabilities of existing and future observing systems","2010","The demand for long-term, sustained, reliable data and derived information on climate and its changes has never been greater than today. Long-term, well-calibrated, global observations of Essential Climate Variables (ECV) such as air temperature, precipitation, and sea-surface temperature are critical for defining the evolving state of the Earth's climate. Observing systems routinely collect much of the required data covering 49 ECVs, and significant progress has been made in coverage and technological capability over the two decades since the Second World Climate Conference. However, many key regions and climatic zones remain poorly observed, and gaps are widening in some cases. Supporting infrastructures for data stewardship and analysis are largely in place but require strengthening, while those for linking with socio-economic data and for providing user-oriented information services require more substantial development. The current capabilities are summarized, and further actions are identified to ensure that climate observation activities more fully meet the needs of science and society. The Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) was established in 1992 with the goal of providing comprehensive information on the total climate system, involving a multidisciplinary range of physical, chemical and biological observations of the atmosphere, oceans and land. GCOS is a “system of systems” that builds on the climate-relevant components of existing observing systems, and relies almost entirely upon national efforts to maintain and enhance those systems. Contributing systems include the World Meteorological Organization Global Observing System (GOS) for meteorology, its Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW) for atmospheric composition, the Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS), led by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC), and the Global Terrestrial Observing System (GTOS), led by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). GCOS itself is the climate observing system within the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) developed under the auspices of the Group on Earth Observations (GEO). The established in situ networks and space-based components must be sustained and operated with ongoing attention to data quality in accordance with the GCOS Climate Monitoring Principles; enhancements must be made for some types of observations; the exchange of observations and delivery of data and information to users must be ensured; reprocessing and reanalysis must be strengthened; and national and international coordination must be improved. The consequence of not meeting these requirements would be to seriously compromise the information on, and predictions of, climate variability and change. Detailed information on GCOS and the datasets that are produced as a result of GCOS observing activities can be found at the Global Observing Systems Information Center (GOSIC) at http://gosic.org.","GEOSS,climate observations,GEO,ECV,GAW,GTOS,GOOS,essential climate variables,GCOS,"
"maritime traffic networks: from historical positioning data to unsupervised maritime traffic monitoring","2018","The large maritime traffic volume and its implications in economy, environment, safety, and security require an unsupervised system to monitor maritime traffic. In this paper, a method is proposed to automatically produce synthetic maritime traffic representations from historical self-reporting positioning data, more specifically from automatic identification system data. The method builds a two-layer network that represents the maritime traffic in the monitored area, where the external layer presents the network's basic structure and the inner layer provides precision and granularity to the representation. The method is tested in a specific scenario with high traffic density, the Baltic Sea. Experimental results reveal a decrease of over 99% storage data with a negligible precision drop. Finally, the novel method presents a light and structured representation of the maritime traffic, which sets the foundations to real-time automatic maritime traffic monitoring, anomaly detection, and situation prediction.","two-layer network,automatic identification system data,anomaly detection,traffic monitoring,synthetic maritime traffic representations,unsupervised maritime traffic monitoring,statistical analysis,real-time automatic maritime traffic monitoring,situation prediction,ships,marine engineering,maritime surveillance,AIS,Artificial intelligence,high traffic density,maritime traffic networks,Sensors,traffic engineering computing,Navigation,Surveillance,Baltic Sea,Data mining,Maritime traffic representation,Security,self-reporting positioning data,"
"results from 3 seasons of surveys in maritime canada using the leica chiroptera ii shallow water topo-bathymetric lidar sensor","2017","The coastal zone is a challenging place to map, techniques for mapping the land cover and elevation do not work under water and methods for mapping the seabed cover and elevation work well in deep water but are dangerous and expensive in shallow water. As a result, detailed information in the shallow coastal zone is lacking. This presentation will focus on the Chiroptera II, a new shallow water topo-bathymetric lidar sensor that is designed to collect seamless elevation data from land to the submerged terrain under coastal or freshwater. The sensor is equipped with a 1064 nm laser capable of a laser scanning frequency up to 500 kHz and a 515 nm green laser capable of a scanning frequency of 35 kHz. The lasers pulses are directed to the surface using a palmer scanner that results in an elliptical scan pattern with a 14 degree forward and back scan angle and a 20 degree left and right scan angle. The NIR laser is used to map details on the land and to assist in defining the water surface, which is critical in order to compensate for the 515 nm laser beam diffraction angle and the change of speed from air to water, thus accurately positioning the reflected seabed return. In addition to collecting the elevation at high resolution ~ 1m and vertical precision ~ 15 cm, the intensity of the reflected green laser also provides insights into what is on the seabed. A 60 MPIX RCD30 camera capable of capturing NIR and RGB bands of imagery is co-aligned with the lidar sensor to provide additional data that can be directly georeferenced with a ca 5 cm resolution. Full waveforms of the green laser are recorded and used to calculate discrete points representing the water surface, objects in the water column and the seabed bathymetry. Standard point attributes include the x, y, z positioning, echo information and intensity or amplitude of the reflected signal. An empirical method has been developed to compensate for the exponential energy loss of the green laser energy with water depth. This method results in a â€œdepth normalizedâ€ seabed intensity image which provides details on the seabed cover materials. Tools have been built to calculate waveform metrics of the seabed return including: total area under the curve, skewness, kurtosis, the left and right distance and angle to the peak. These waveform metrics can then be used to construct grids representing the metrics which can be used for subsequent bottom cover classification. NSCC-AGRG has conducted topo-bathy lidar surveys throughout Maritime Canada for the past 3 years using this sensor. Since the sensor relies on the penetration of 515 nm light to detect the seabed, water clarity and the reflectivity of the seabed are constraints on the depth of penetration of the lidar. Coastal waters have variable turbidity, often dominated by wind induced wave action that suspends near shore sediments causing poor survey conditions. A turbidity management system has been designed that relies on meteorological forecasts and observed wind conditions as well as shoreline orientation along the coast to predict suitable periods for bathymetric lidar surveys. The turbidity management system will be presented as well as the results of several surveys. Various applications of these data will be presented including mapping submerged aquatic vegetation, providing input to hydrodynamic model simulations to support aquaculture site selection and improve oil spill preparedness, and shoreline sensitivity mapping. In areas of repeat surveys, the sensor has demonstrated the capability of mapping subtle changes in the dynamic near shore environment.","seagrass,wavelength 1064.0 nm,aquaculture site selection,wavelength 515.0 nm,near shore sediments,turbidity management system,Surface waves,water clarity,Sea measurements,shoreline sensitivity mapping,Leica Chiroptera II shallow water topobathymetric lidar sensor,Laser radar,geophysical image processing,Surface emitting lasers,seabed cover materials,topo-bathymetric lidar,frequency 500.0 kHz,water column,NSCC-AGRG,circulation model,laser scanning frequency,remote sensing by laser beam,land cover,green laser energy,laser beam diffraction angle,coastal waters,oil spill preparedness,map details,optical radar,bathymetry,aquatic vegetation mapping,freshwater,near shore environment,bottom mapping,vegetation,NIR laser,MPIX RCD30 camera,maritime Canada,bathymetric lidar surveys,depth normalized seabed intensity image,bottom reflectance,frequency 35.0 kHz,shallow coastal zone,lasers pulses,Vegetation mapping,palmer scanner,sediments,aquaculture,Reflectivity,"
"improved gnss vector tracking loop to enhance the navigation performance of usv","2022","The Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) is the most common source of location and heading information for unmanned surface vehicle (USV) in real time. However, in areas such as ports or bridges, the GNSS signal will be occluded or weakened. The carrier frequency and code frequency of scalar tracking (ST) in GNSS receiver fluctuates greatly, and even the tracking loop will lose lock. To enhance the navigation performance of USV's GNSS receiver, this paper proposes a framework that uses fixed-lag smoothing (FLS) to assist vector tracking (VT) and applies unscented Kalman filter in the navigation processor. The pseudo-range error and pseudo-range rate error are used as the measurements of navigation processor. FLS serves as a backward filter to enhance the tracking ability of the code loop. The field experiments show that the positioning error of the proposed method is reduced by 72.1% compared to the traditional VT method in the open-sky environments. When the signal is occluded, the positioning results of the traditional ST are dispersed, and also the traditional VT method displays a large error. Moreover, the proposed method is able to reduce the positioning error by 85.4%. The proposed GNSS loop tracking architecture and method can provide a possible solution for USV's navigation system development.","Signal occlusion,GNSS,Vector tracking,Unmanned surface vehicle,Fixed-lag smoothing,"

Previously, corridor analysis has been accomplished with innovative straight-line diagrams for land transportation but can be extended to evaluate disorganized corridors such as waterways. Attacks can originate from aerial, submerged, and surface origins with unique security risks associated with waterway channel geometry. A prioritization framework is required for defense operations of maritime transport, which is achieved through a multi-factor security and safety corridor analysis.

"holocene temperature changes in northern fennoscandia reconstructed from chironomids using bayesian modelling","2002","The recently developed Bayesian multinomial calibration model, Bummer, was applied to the fossil chironomid assemblages of a lake situated at the present tree-line in northern Fennoscandia to reconstruct patterns in Holocene climates. The results are compared with inferences derived using non-Bayesian weighted averaging partial least-squares regression. The reconstruction exhibits both long-term trends as well as a series of shorter-term oscillations. Abrupt climatic excursions were particularly characteristic for the early Holocene period, with cooling episodes around 9200, 8600 and 8200calyr BP. The interval from ca 8000 to 5800calyr BP appeared to be warm and stable, but was followed by a pronounced climatic cooling around 5800calyr BP leading to a relatively long-lasting mid-Holocene temperature minimum between ca 5800 and 4000calyr BP. The reconstruction during the latter part of the Holocene is relatively featureless, which may partly be due to gradual shallowing of the lake by sedimentation that may have affected chironomid compositions, thereby masking the climate signal. The major climatic patterns in our reconstruction agree well with inferences from Greenland ice and marine sediments and are also in line with the previous reconstructions based on diatoms and pollen from the same core, although the finer-scale variations reflected by the three proxies do not always match. The overall results provide evidence for climatic complexity during the Holocene epoch and demonstrate that Bayesian modelling is highly suitable for reconstruction purposes.",""
"instantaneous global navigation satellite system (gnss)-based attitude determination for maritime applications","2012","Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) is a valuable technology for a large number of maritime applications. Other than providing the absolute positioning service, it aids many demanding applications, such as precise docking, formation of surface craft, autonomous vehicles, sinkage monitoring, etc. GNSS carrier-phase-based algorithms provide high-precision positioning solutions, but an integer number of cycles inherent to the observed signal have to be resolved. A newly developed GNSS carrier-phase ambiguity resolution method is tested. The new method solves for the unknown number of integer cycles by exploiting the known placement of the GNSS antennas aboard the vessel. The a priori information on the antennas baseline separation is employed as a hard constraint. A simplified (linearized) version of the method, suitable for large vessels, is also analyzed. The new method was tested against the most challenging scenario when processing GNSS data: single-frequency, single-epoch, unaided ambiguity resolution. Through different tests, the high performance of the new method is demonstrated: high fixing rate, large robustness, and short time-to-fix after initialization, cycle slips, and/or loss of locks.

"textual risk mining for maritime situational awareness","2014","In this paper, we propose an auxiliary Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) integrated system for maritime situational awareness (MSA) operations. We bring into account a new and influential asset - human intuition and perception - to the existing semi-automated decision support systems that mostly rely on numerical data collected by electronic sensors or cameras located either directly on the vessels or in the maritime command-and-control centers. For our project, we gathered weekly textual reports spanning twelve months from the United States Worldwide Threats to Shipping Reports repository that belongs to the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), We considered the maritime incident reports written by human operators as a valuable and accessible unstructured textual input source in which a span of text1 is called â€œriskâ€ if it expresses one of the following kinds of vessel incidents: fired, robbed, boarded, hijacked, attacked, chased, approached, kidnapped, boarding attempted, suspiciously approached or clashed with. Our approach benefits from probability distributions of some useful features annotated based on a list of lexicons that contain expressions denoting vessel types, risks types, risk associates, maritime geographical locations, dates and times. These distributions are captured and used to anchor the span of â€œrisksâ€ as they are described in the textual reports. After some preprocessing steps that include tokenization, named entity extraction and part-of-speech tagging, the textual risk mining system applies a variety of sequence classification algorithms, e.g., Conditional Random Fields, Conditional Markov Models and Hidden Markov Models in order to compare the risk classification performance.

"seamless and intelligent resource allocation in 6g maritime networks framework via deep reinforcement learning","2023","Sixth-generation (6G) communication networks will fulfill usersâ€™ requests for high data speeds and low latency without causing network outages throughout the world. However, marine communication in deep-sea waters is expanding as maritime traffic grows. To serve mission-critical applications, a growing number of maritime end-users require high throughput and low latency. Although deep-sea satellite connections will enable 6G networks, however due to limited service capacity owing to the long propagation delay between end-user and satellites. We propose unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as aerial backhauling and a relay medium in the marine communication network assisted by satellites and coastal base stations (BSs). The power allocation strategy of multi-satellites for a 6G network is investigated in this work. The power allocation problem is non-convex, hence deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is used to solve it instead of the conventional optimization technique. Our research aims to optimize the networkâ€™s total capacity in the case when the satellites are randomly and densely dispersed. We provide a deep neural network and a method for mapping wireless power allocation for multi-satellites.

"sea surface height measurements using a low-cost gnss buoy with multiple gnss receivers","2023","Accurate Sea surface height (SSH) measurements are important for global climate change and sea level rise monitoring. Satellite altimeters can provide global coverage observations but with coarse temporal and spatial resolution, while tide gauges offer high-precision measurements but are limited to coastal regions. The advent of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) buoys bridge the gap between the tide station and the satellite altimeter, which realize continuous and reliable absolute SSH measurements in the coastal zone. However, most of buoys are equipped with GNSS geodetic receivers and antennas, which are expensive and with high power consumption. The emergence of low-cost receivers has been applied in fields such as autonomous driving and disaster monitoring, yet low-cost receivers suffer precision limitations due to signal quality issue in the harsh marine environment. To solve the reliability issue of low-cost receivers in SSH measurements, firstly, a low-cost buoy platform with four dual-frequency receivers is designed in this contribution. GNSS antennas are installed on the four corners of a square with a side length of 1.180 m, and the total power consumption is less than 4 W. Additionally, a robust outlier detection method, the Geometric Constraint algorithm, is proposed to improve the reliability and accuracy of GNSS SSH results. The performance of our buoy was validated in Jingye Lake at Tianjin University on April 30, 2022, and another experiment was conducted in Bohai Bay, Tianjin, on August 20, 2022, to assess the performance of a self-developed MG-Buoy for SSH measurement under real oceanic conditions. The experimental results indicate that the precision of single-frequency SSH measurement is 0.91 cm using the GNSS Post Processed Kinematic (PPK) technique with a single antenna, while the dual-frequency can achieve 0.50 cm accuracy. After adopting the Geometric Constraint method, the measurement accuracy of single-frequency and dual-frequency SSH values are 0.49 cm and 0.40 cm, respectively, representing a 46.2% and 20.0% improvements compared to the root mean square (RMS) value for the single GNSS antenna.","Geometric Constraint,Sea surface height,Attitude measurements,Multiple GNSS receivers,Low-cost,Buoy,"

To solve this problem, in this paper, we propose an Automatic Self-Reconstruction (ASR) model that combines Radio Encoding-based Deep Fingerprint Positioning (RE-DFP) and Radio Anomaly Detecting (RAD), which enables seamless positioning of Wi-Fi fingerprinting. The proposed model consists of an encoder-decoder-based RE-DFP network to improve positioning accuracy and data efficiency and a RAD network to analyze environmental dynamics according to APs. In the proposed RE-DFP, a CNN-based encoder is applied to increase efficiency by minimizing the dependence of the radio map, and the position is estimated through an LSTM-based decoder. RAD identifies the AP, which is the cause of the change in the radio map and excludes it from the online phase, preventing a decrease in positioning accuracy. Simultaneously, the proposed model collects the RSSI of the identified AP through crowdsourcing and reconstructs the radio map by itself, enabling a seamless positioning service in the online phase.","Radio map,RE-DFP,Indoor positioning system,Fingerprinting,RAD,"
"centennial and millennial-scale hydroclimate changes in northwestern patagonia since 16,000 yr bp","2016","We examine hydroclimate changes at centennial/millennial timescales since 16,000 yr BP in northwestern Patagonia based on the pollen and charcoal record from Lago El Salto, a small closed-basin lake located in the Chilean Lake District (41°38′48.02″S, 73° 5′48.42″W). We observe cold/wet conditions between 14,500–16,000 yr BP, followed by further cooling with increased precipitation until 13,000 yr BP, enhanced precipitation seasonality and/or variability between 11,600–13,000 yr BP, and an extended warm-and-dry interval between 7600 and 11,300 yr BP with peak paleofire activity. Colder-and-wetter than present conditions and muted paleofire activity prevail between 5300 and 7600 yr BP, followed by alternating cold/wet and centennial-scale warm/dry phases starting at 5300 yr BP with three conspicuous megadroughts since 2500 yr BP. The most recent megadrought occurred during the Medieval Climate Anomaly. We identify a cold reversal that spans the Antarctic Cold Reversal (ACR) and the Younger Dryas (YD) chrons with stronger-than-present westerly influence during the former and enhanced variability during the latter. These results extend the northern limit of strong cooling and increase in precipitation during the ACR and the southern limit of influence of strong hydrologic variations during the YD in terrestrial environments, suggesting an overlap in the spheres of influence of processes originating from southern and northern polar latitudes. An extended warm southern westerly wind (SWW)-minimum interval is evident between 7600 and 11,300 yr BP, followed by a rapid shift to cool-moist conditions between 5300 and 7600 yr BP brought by a mid-Holocene SWW maximum. Since then we observe centennial-scale hydroclimate variability, which has driven biodiversity and fire-regime shifts of evergreen temperate rainforests.","Centennial/millennial-scale climate variability,Southern westerly winds,Northwestern Patagonia,Holocene,Antarctic Cold Reversal,"
"the wedge clam (donax trunculus) hand-operated fishery in the nw mediterranean sea: landings, catch composition, damage rates and impact of fishing activity","2023","The bivalve wedge clam Donax trunculus is a highly valued species in Spain, but wild stocks have decreased in the Mediterranean region in recent decades. Internal demand exceeds the existing supply derived from local production. Hand-operated dredge fishery is still important in some coastal areas of Spain, such as the Ebro Delta (NE Spain). However, scientific information is lacking on most aspects of this fishery which is essential for its sustainable management. In this context, this study aimed to provide the first characterization of the hand-operated dredges fishery; evaluate the damage of this fishery on the megabenthic fauna; and analyze the impact of the fishing activity on the wedge clam. Our results indicate that landings declined dramatically since the mid-1990s and the main causes for this decline are postulated. Fishing effort was highly seasonal, being more intense from March to September. The discard fraction was very small (5.74% in abundance and the 3.74% in biomass) and 61.93% of the discards did not suffer damage. Clam fishing activity had an impact on recruit density in the short term (3 months), but not on recruit size and commercial fraction density, biomass and size. Our results provide tools for a better management of this type of fisheries.","Small-scale fisheries,Wedge clam,Clam fisheries,Management,"
"a continuous record of vegetation, fire-regime and climatic changes in northwestern patagonia spanning the last 25,000 years","2018","We present a high-resolution precisely dated terrestrial paleovegetation/paleoclimate record from Lago Pichilaguna, northwestern Patagonia (40°–44°S), which spans continuously from the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) to the present. We find abundant and continuous presence of arboreal pollen (chiefly Nothofagus) during the LGM, accompanied by other trees, shrubs, and alpine herbs. These results suggest Subantarctic parkland and/or scattered woodlands under a cold and hyperhumid climate during the LGM (∼25,000–17,800 cal. yr BP) with expansion of Nothofagus under relatively warm interstadial conditions between 25,000 and 19,200 cal. yr BP. This was followed by cooling and a precipitation increase between 19,200 and 17,800 cal. yr BP, which was contemporaneous with the youngest LGM advance of Andean glaciers in the region and maximum influence of the Southern Westerly Wind (SWW). The Last Glacial Termination (T1) started at 17,800 cal. yr BP and featured the spread of thermophilous trees and ferns characteristic of North Patagonian rainforests, along with lake level lowering. These results suggest a warm pulse and southward shift of the SWW, concurrent with a rapid collapse of Andean glacier lobes. Subsequent changes led to the establishment of closed-canopy rainforests under peak interstadial warmth between ∼16,000 and 15,000 cal. yr BP. We detect a shift to cold/wet conditions during the Antarctic Cold Reversal (14,800–12,700 cal. yr BP) and a precipitation decline during Younger Dryas time, followed by maximum temperature, relatively lower lake level and minimum SWW influence between 11,300 and 7700 cal. yr BP. Precipitation then rose punctuated by centennial-scale variations since 6200 cal. yr BP. Chilean-European deforestation and spread of invasive exotic species started at ∼350 cal. yr BP aided by fire. We conclude that temperate rainforests have persisted with little interruption since T1, with major changes in floristic composition driven by climate change and fires. Rainforest composition and heterogeneity declined in response to Chilean/European disturbance during the 1600s and intensified since the 1800s. These events constitute the fastest/largest-magnitude vegetation changes of the last ∼25,000 years.","Southern westerly winds,Vegetation history,Last glacial termination,Fire disturbance,Holocene,Last glacial maximum,Northwestern patagonia,"
"two-timescale beam selection and power allocation for maritime offshore communications","2021","In this letter, beam selection and power allocation are investigated for maritime offshore communications. Considering the slow-changing network topology and the line-of-sight (LOS) dominant propagation of land-sea links, we define a beam configuration period (BCP) as a time span to contain numerous coherence intervals (CIs), and provide a two-timescale design by enforcing the long-term beam selection strategy and the short-term power allocation scheme only once in every BCP and in every CI, respectively. Since the beamforming configurations are updated much less frequently, the training overhead could be considerably reduced. Numerical results indicate that the proposed two-timescale design avoids heavy training overhead, and thus effectively enhances the performance of offshore communications.","line-of-sight dominant propagation,beam configuration period,array signal processing,two-timescale design,Maritime offshore communication,maritime offshore communications,Marine vehicles,coherence intervals,Resource management,beam selection,telecommunication network topology,Quality of service,power allocation,Network topology,long-term beam selection strategy,beamforming configurations,short-term power allocation scheme,BCP,Indexes,Training,marine communication,network topology,Downlink,two-timescale beam selection,land-sea links,resource allocation,numerous coherence intervals,"
"adaptive shipborne base station sleeping control for dynamic broadband maritime communications","2017","Increasing marine activities taking place within the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) have made broadband maritime communications very attractive in recent years. In this paper, a coordinated satellite and terrestrial architecture (II-CST) is presented to implement real-time and broadband Internet access at sea. Further, since the mobility of shipborne base stations (S-BSs) may cause complex inter-cell interference (ICI), an S-BS sleeping control scheme is proposed to adapt the system resource allocation corresponding with the user load. When the proportion of blocked users is beyond threshold, the sleeping control process is triggered to reduce ICI and recover broadband access. Then we use the sailing position of accessed users as a constraint to adjust the downlink power allocation of S-BSs. Simulation results with real ship data of China's Yellow Sea show that under the II-CST, our adaptive S-BS sleeping control can contribute to achievable downlink data rate, mobility robustness, and power efficiency of the dynamic broadband maritime communication system.","Satellites,broadband access,broadband maritime communication,system resource allocation,Marine vehicles,shipborne base stations,Switches,accessed users,Mobile communication,shipborne BS sleeping,inter-cell interference coordination,ICI,sleeping control process,blocked users,dynamic broadband maritime communication system,adaptive shipborne base station sleeping control,ships,power allocation,cellular radio,coordinated satellite,terrestrial architecture,Broadband communication,complex intercell interference,adaptive S-BS sleeping control,China Yellow Sea show,marine activities,Sleep apnea,II-CST,Real-time systems,downlink power allocation,dynamic broadband maritime communications,broadband networks,marine communication,Internet,exclusive economic zone,resource allocation,user load,"
"changes in maritime traffic patterns according to installation of floating lidar using spatial analysis","2023","Recently, with the development of marine space around the world, friction between maritime traffic and various marine activities is intensifying. In particular, different recommendations are being made for the buffer zone between offshore wind farms and maritime traffic, as the criteria vary significantly. In order to respond to these changes in marine space, conducted this study on the change of maritime traffic patterns before and after the installation of floating LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) in marine facilities and apply it to future changes in maritime traffic patterns. The maritime traffic data was based on Automatic Identification System (AIS) data, and it was targeted at cargo ships and tankers with regular traffic patterns. A trajectory and spatial analysis were performed based on the AIS in the marine space. As a result of analyzing the globally maritime traffic patterns targeting the location of the installation complex of LiDARs, it can be confirmed that the existing maritime traffic patterns change into three maritime traffic patterns. Furthermore, the study employed the Hausdorff-distance algorithm for clustering analysis, categorizing vessels with similar trajectories. This approach facilitated a locally analysis of the buffer zone associated with individual LiDAR, considering the length of the vessels. As a result, it was analyzed that each vessel navigated at different buffer zone depending on the size of the vessel, and it is possible for safe navigation and forecast the future maritime traffic patterns.","Traffic control,Maritime traffic,maritime traffic data,buffer zone,Marine vehicles,wind power plants,globally maritime traffic patterns,Laser radar,marine space,existing maritime traffic patterns change,ships,marine safety,marine engineering,Wind farms,marine facilities,Oceans,regular traffic patterns,pattern clustering,Artificial intelligence,offshore installations,optical radar,future maritime traffic patterns,telecommunication traffic,spatial analysis,automatic identification system (AIS),Analytical models,"
"understanding altimetry signals in the northeastern ligurian sea using a multi-platform approach","2019","During the Long-Term Glider Mission for Environmental Characterization 2016 sea trial, carried out in the eastern Ligurian Sea (Northwestern Mediterranean Sea), two gliders rated to a maximum depth of 1000 m operated continuously from 3 May 2016–27 June 2016. When possible, glider tracks were synchronized with the contemporaneous footprints of the Jason-2, SARAL/AltiKa and CryoSat-2 altimeters. Temperature and salinity measured by the gliders that were co-localised with the altimeter passages were used to calculate along-track dynamic heights (DH). The latter were then compared with the altimeters’ near real-time absolute dynamic topography (ADT) measurements. ADT and DH values showed very similar, but shifted patterns, suggesting that gliders had sampled the same structures but at different times. Average surface absolute geostrophic velocities at the time of glider transit were used in a novel relocation technique to reposition glider measurements where they would have been at the time of the altimeter passage. The relocation increases the correlation between datasets to a value close to 1 and reduces the RMSE of an order of magnitude, also when the time-difference between measurements was greater than 3 days. The sea level spatial and temporal variability is attributed to the presence of meanders generated by the baroclinic instability of the Liguro- Provençal Current (LPC). These meanders are characterized by a 38 km amplitude and 0.12 m s−1 average propagation speed that are confirmed by the larger scale ocean colour measurements and are in agreement with those previously described in the literature. We found that the presence of LPC meanders in along-track ADT and DH measurements is evidenced by a decrease in sea level when profiles sampled the Modified Atlantic Water, and an increase in sea level when measurements sampled the adjacent waters of Tyrrhenian Sea origin. The relocation technique introduced here is expected to improve future altimetry-glider comparisons, as similar validation experiments were considered possible only when glider and altimetry measurements were near synoptic, and collected up to one day from each other.","Near real-time altimetry,Gliders,Liguro-Provençal Current meanders,Ligurian sea,Glider relocation,"

"15 - concrete aggregates","2019","The usefulness of mixing together stones, sand and some form of binder or cement to form ‘concrete’ has been recognized since Stone Age times. The Romans developed a rather advanced appreciation of concrete technology, including the use of pozzolanas, experimentation with concrete reinforced using bronze bars and the introduction of lightweight and even air-entrained concrete. The stones and sand, or ‘aggregates’, were only included as bulking materials, but the writings of Vitruvius in De Architectura demonstrate that the Romans recognised the influence of rock types and particle size distribution on the selection of aggregates for good-quality concrete and mortars. In more recent times, it has become increasingly understood that the properties of aggregates can have an important bearing on the properties and durability of the concrete in which they are used, so that today the requirements for successful aggregates are closely specified and controlled. Concrete is the major structural engineering material of modern times and aggregates comprise around three-quarters by volume of concrete, so that the importance of the quality of those aggregates can hardly be overstated.","Quarrying,Sources,Properties,Manufactured aggregates,Recycled aggregates,Influences on concrete properties,Composition,Durability,Testing,Aggregates,Dredging,Geology,"
"a history of vegetation, sediment and nutrient dynamics at tivoli north bay, hudson estuary, new york","2012","We conduct a stratigraphic paleoecological investigation at a Hudson River National Estuarine Research Reserve (HRNERR) site, Tivoli Bays, spanning the past 1100 years. Marsh sediment cores were analyzed for ecosystem changes using multiple proxies, including pollen, spores, macrofossils, charcoal, sediment bulk chemistry, and stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes. The results reveal climatic shifts such as the warm and dry Medieval Warm Period (MWP) followed by the cooler Little Ice Age (LIA), along with significant anthropogenic influence on the watershed ecosystem. A five-fold expansion of invasive species, including Typha angustifolia and Phragmites australis, is documented along with marked changes in sediment composition and nutrient input. During the last century, a ten-fold sedimentation rate increase due to land-use changes is observed. The large magnitude of shifts in vegetation, sedimentation, and nutrients during the last few centuries suggest that human activities have made the greatest impact to the marshes of the Hudson Estuary during the last millennium. Climate variability and ecosystem changes similar to those observed at other marshes in northeastern and mid-Atlantic estuaries, attest to the widespread regional signature recorded at Tivoli Bays.","nitrogen cycle,tidal marshes,invasive species,New York,Little Ice Age,Medieval Warm period,paleoecology,stable isotopes,climate change,European settlement,palynology,"

"making sense of heterogeneous maritime data","2022","While an abundance of real-time maritime information exists and is readily available to monitoring authorities, there are still many instances in which ships are found to be engaged in dangerous or illegal activities.

In this paper we report on research done in cooperation with Denbridge Marine Ltd., a global provider of maritime solutions, and present an application integrated in a Vessel Tracking Services system that allows the detection of normal vessel activity as well as dangerous or illegal situations in real-time, using information from the Automatic Identification System, a radar sensor and other information.

"a bayesian iterative geomagnetic model with universal data input: self-consistent spherical harmonic evolution for the geomagnetic field over the last 4000 years","2019","Changes of the Earth's magnetic field have been observed with varying spatial and temporal resolution since the middle ages by means of compasses, and later by refined mechanical inclination and intensity instruments, until the modern use of quantum mechanical devices and satellite observations. Ancient records, on the other hand, rely on the natural magnetization of archaeological artifacts and other materials, such as rocks and sediments, being therefore indirect, less accurate and sparser. The combination of such heterogeneous records into a single, self-consistent, global model of the geomagnetic field is very challenging: the highly uneven data coverage, both in space and time, requires a careful handling of data uncertainties and error correlations. Previous models dealt with this problem using separated treatments of instrumental data and indirect records, respectively, as well as a different handling of the dipole field component, with respect to non-dipole terms. Here we present a global geomagnetic field model based, for the first time, on the simultaneous inversion of historical, archaeomagnetic, and volcanic records, using a Bayesian approach with minimal-committing time regularization that minimizes the energy of secular variation. A detailed assessment of data uncertainty and error correlation is used to minimize artifacts generated by the appearance of an overwhelming number of incomplete, mostly declination-only records, associated with shipboard measurements in the early colonial period. Our model yields lower dipole energies, which better match modern values, as well as higher non-dipole energies and a stronger secular variation of the dipole moment. Some model artifacts associated with extremely heterogeneous distributions of records in time and space are not completely eliminable and might be caused by incorrect a-priori uncertainty assessments. Alternatively, they might represent an intrinsic limit that can be overcome only by adding new records at critical locations and times.","Geomagnetism,Field modeling,Historical records,Secular variation,Archaeomagnetism,"
"the first detection of the madden-julian oscillation signal in daily to hourly resolution proxy records derived from a natural archive of giant clam shell (tridacna spp.)","2021","The Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) is the most prominent mode of intraseasonal variability in the tropics which is responsible for much of the observed intraseasonal climate variance not only there but also in higher latitudes. The short time-span of modern instrumental data limits our understanding of the MJO and obtaining MJO information from natural archives could extend this greatly. Here a Giant Clam shell (Tridacna spp.) with a life span about two years (from January 29, 2012 to December 9, 2013) was collected from the northern South China Sea, in the western Pacific. Several daily to hourly resolution biological and geochemical proxy records, including the daily growth rate, hourly Fe/Ca, Sr/Ca and fluorescence intensity, were developed to compare these with local weather/climate records. Spectral analyses suggested that these ultra-high resolution proxy records can clearly record MJO variability in the tropics. The substantial connection between the proxy records and MJO possibly linking through the local effective solar radiation, SST, precipitation and wind speeds. This is the first record of the MJO signal in a natural paleoclimate archive. Our findings provide new insights to study the MJO beyond the instrumental records, and since fossil Tridacna shells from different geological times can be used to investigate the MJO under various climate conditions.","shell,MJO,proxy records,daily growth rate,ultra-high-resolution,"
"emergent crowns and light-use complementarity lead to global maximum biomass and leaf area in sequoia sempervirens forests","2016","Forests >80m tall have the highest biomass, and individual trees in these forests are Earth’s largest with deep crowns emerging above neighboring vegetation, but it is unclear to what degree these maxima depend on the emergent trees themselves or a broader-scale forest structure. Here we advance the concept of emergent facilitation, whereby emergent trees benefit co-occurring species. Trees reorganize foliage within crowns to optimize available light and, if long-lived, can reiterate after crown damage to become emergent. The height, depth, and spacing of emergent trees in turn allows for abundant light to pass through the canopy, leading to light-use complementarity as well as elevated biomass, leaf area, and species diversity of the forest as a whole. We chose Sequoia sempervirens to develop this concept and installed eleven 1-ha plots in old-growth forests spanning nearly six degrees of latitude in California. Each plot was based off a 316-m-long centerline where biomass and leaf area of all vegetation were quantified. We employed hierarchical measurements and stratified random sampling spanning the full size range of individuals to generate 180 equations for determining biomass and leaf area of all dominant plant species in these forests. Biomass (5190Mgha−1), leaf area (LAI=19.4), and aboveground carbon (2600Mgha−1) are global maxima, occurring in plots with the highest proportion of emergent trees. Decay-resistant Sequoia heartwood contributes the bulk of this mass, ranging from 61.5 to 76.7% of plot totals. Heartwood is a key contributor to the development of trees with emergent crowns, since its durability enables trees to recover leaf area and to re-grow crowns after damage so that they can continue expanding for millennia. By distributing leaf area among fewer trees with deeper crowns, Sequoia maintains very high leaf area itself (LAI up to 14.5) while simultaneously allowing other species to flourish underneath (non-Sequoia LAI up to 8.0). Because Sequoia is not replaced by other species, aboveground biomass, leaf area, and carbon content of these forests are essentially asymptotic over time.","Forest structure,Leaf area,Heartwood,Allometric equations,Biomass,LAI,Carbon sequestration,Old growth,Emergent trees,LiDAR,Light-use complementarity,"
"mollusk shell alterations resulting from coastal contamination and other environmental factors","2020","Effects of contamination on aquatic organisms have been investigated and employed as biomarkers in environmental quality assessment for years. A commonly referenced aquatic organism, mollusks represent a group of major interest in toxicological studies. Both gastropods and bivalves have external mineral shells that protects their soft tissue from predation and desiccation. These structures are composed of an organic matrix and an inorganic matrix, both of which are affected by environmental changes, including exposure to hazardous chemicals. This literature review evaluates studies that propose mollusk shell alterations as biomarkers of aquatic system quality. The studies included herein show that changes to natural variables such as salinity, temperature, food availability, hydrodynamics, desiccation, predatory pressure, and substrate type may influence the form, structure, and composition of mollusk shells. However, in the spatial and temporal studies performed in coastal waters around the world, shells of organisms sampled from multi-impacted areas were found to differ in the form and composition of both organic and inorganic matrices relative to shells from less contaminated areas. Though these findings are useful, the toxicological studies were often performed in the field and were not able to attribute shell alterations to a specific molecule. It is known that the organic matrix of shells regulates the biomineralization process; proteomic analyses of shells may therefore elucidate how different contaminants affect shell biomineralization. Further research using approaches that allow a clearer distinction between shell alterations caused by natural variations and those caused by anthropogenic influence, as well as studies to identify which molecule is responsible for such alterations or to determine the ecological implications of shell alterations, are needed before any responses can be applied universally.","Shell proteomics,Biomarker,Coastal water contamination,Geometric morphometrics,Shell elemental composition,Shell plasticity,"

"a framework for discovering maritime traffic conflict from ais network","2017","Thanks for the common use of Automatic Identification System (AIS) network has made a large number of the maritime traffic data to be available. Ships equipped with AIS automatically exchange navigational information with nearby ships and terrestrial AIS receivers to facilitate the tracking and monitoring of ships' location and movement for collision avoidance and control. Obviously, with increasing amount of maritime shipping traffic, the navigational collisions are one of the growing safety concerns in maritime traffic situation awareness. To understand the collision situations can help the maritime traffic managers to improve the safety control of maritime traffic. However, it is difficult to statistically analyze such collision due to the number of collected real cases of collisions are relatively low within a short period of time. To overcome the problem of low sample size, we discover traffic conflict from data collected by AIS network to substitute the real collision. Given a set of maritime traffic data collected from AIS network, we try to discover ships' movements that have conflict behaviors and these behaviors may bring a possible collision if they do not take any evasive action. We propose a framework of Clustering-and-Detection to automatically discover the clusters of conflict trajectory from AIS trajectory data in an unsupervised way. Based on real AIS data, the experimental results show that the proposed framework is able to effectively discover sets of trajectory with conflict situation from maritime AIS traffic data. The statistical analysis on the discovered sets of conflict trajectory is able to provide useful knowledge for maritime traffic monitoring.","maritime traffic situation awareness,maritime traffic monitoring,maritime shipping traffic,maritime traffic conflict,maritime AIS traffic data,collision situations,Safety,maritime traffic data,Automatic Identification System network,Marine vehicles,AIS network,ships,marine safety,marine engineering,real AIS data,terrestrial AIS receivers,pattern clustering,Trajectory data mining,Artificial intelligence,safety control,conflict behaviors,clustering-and-detection,AIS data,Roads,Trajectory,conflict trajectory,conflict situation,Conflict detection,Maritime traffic data,Navigation,navigation,nearby ships,collision avoidance,Data mining,navigational collisions,maritime traffic managers,Navigation collision,"

The main restriction lies in the low Equivalent Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRP) level of navigation satellites. Extending the integration times with proper target motion compensation has been shown to be a viable solution to improve ship detectability, but this involves computational complexity and increasing sensitivity to motion model mismatches. In this work, we consider the application of a Track-Before-Detect (TBD) method to considerably increase the integration time (and therefore the detection capability) at the same time keeping the computational complexity affordable by practical systems. Dynamic programming TBD algorithms have been specialized for the considered framework and tested against experimental dataset.

"disentangling dust and sand deposition using a peat record in ce europe (northern romania): a multiproxy approach","2019","Aeolian sediments play an important role in the global climatic system and occur in the atmosphere due to soil and bedrock erosion. Here, we applied three different methods: geochemical (XRF), manual and laser-based particle size analysis to an ombrotrophic peat profile in the Carpathian Mountains to determine changes in aeolian deposition and wind/storm activity over the last 7800 years. The results show the following changes in aeolian fluxes (dust and sand) over time: 7800–4150 cal. yr BP – generally low dust fluxes with a periodic intensification of sand fluxes; 4150–2300 cal. yr BP – intense deposition of both dust and sand; 2300–150 cal. yr BP – fluctuating dust and sand fluxes; the last 200 years – the highest amplitude of both sand and dust fluxes. This study found that patterns in aeolian fluxes were influenced by a combination of climate and human impact, but with anthropogenic drivers, such as disturbance by fire, becoming more important in recent times. We also found a good agreement with other studies of dust fluxes for the earlier part of this record, but an increasing divergence over the last 3500 years.

"multi-armed bandits scheme for tasks offloading in mec-enabled maritime communication networks","2020","Driven by the advancement of science and technology, the issue of marine ship Internet of Things (IoT) users' assignment of computing tasks offloading has become more and more challenging. When faced with the complex and dynamic marine environment, considering the different quality requirements of maritime applications, we have addressed this issue in this paper. We first propose the space-air-ground-edge (SAGE) maritime communication network architecture. This novel architecture is used to offload computing-intensive applications and services for IoT users in the marine environment. At the same time, based on the Multi-Armed Bandits (MAB) problem, considering budget constraints and other marine environmental conditions such as delay and energy consumption, we propose an algorithm for selecting an edge server strategy.

"gis-based identification of spatial variables enhancing heat and poor air quality in urban areas","2012","Due to anthropogenic climate change heat waves are expected to occur more frequently in the future, which might cause adverse health effects for urban population. Especially the combination of high temperatures and poor air quality impinges on the well-being of man. This accentuates the need for assessing the health risks of residents regarding air pollutants and anomalously high summer air temperatures. However, comprehensive information on the spatial and temporal distribution of temperature and particulate matter (PM) concentration in cities are presently difficult to obtain since only few measurement sites exist. In order to identify hot spots with high health risks for distinct groups of urban population, measurement campaigns were carried out, capturing the spatial distribution of temperature and PM concentrations in the City of Aachen, Germany (pop. 245,000). Several locations were selected to examine spatial influences such as topography, building density, vegetation and traffic on temperature and PM. The findings permit the detection of urban environmental variables that contribute to both temperature enhancement and poor air quality. Those variables were used as spatial predictors for the identification of possible hot spots inside and outside the area of field measurements. The zones of enhanced risks of high air temperature and PM levels were detected by means of GIS based geo-statistic modeling. These areas were mainly identified in the inner city, which is characterized by a dense building structure and heavy traffic. A chemical characterization of different PM fractions complements the GIS based investigations. The analysis of toxicologically relevant components provides information on air quality at urban, suburban and rural sites. The results of the chemical analyses support the results obtained from geo-statistical modeling. It reveals high concentrations of health relevant airborne species like metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons within the zone of enhanced risk for the coincidence of temperature stress and PM pollution.","Heat,Air pollution,Health,Particulate matter,Climate change,GIS,"

Extending the existing IEC 61162-450 protocol makes it is possible to build a backward-compatible authentication mechanism that prevents common cyber attacks.

"a self-learning mean optimization filter to improve bluetooth 5.1 aoa indoor positioning accuracy for ship environments","2023","As COVID-19 is still spreading globally, the narrow ship space makes COVID-19 easier for the virus to infect ship passengers. Tracking close contacts remains an effective way to reduce the risk of virus transmission. Therefore, indoor positioning technology should be developed for ship environments. Today, almost all smart devices are equipped with Bluetooth. The Angle of Arrival (AoA) using Bluetooth 5.1 indoor positioning technology is well suited for ship environments. But the narrow ship space and steel walls make the multipath effect more pronounced in ship environments. This also means that more noises are included in the signal. In the Uniform Rectangular Array (URA) type receiving antenna array, elevation and azimuth angles are two important parameters for the AoA indoor positioning technology. Elevation and azimuth angles are unstable because of the influence of noise. In this paper, a Self-Learning Mean Optimization Filter (SLMOF) is proposed. The goal of SLMOF is to find the optimal elevation and azimuth angles as a way to improve the Bluetooth 5.1 AoA indoor positioning accuracy. The experimental results show that the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of SLMOF is 0.44 m, which improves the accuracy by 72% compared to Kalman Filter (KF). This method can be applied to find the optimal average in every dataset.","Indoor positioning,Ship environments,Angle of arrival,Bluetooth,"

To reduce again the complexity in order to solve huge problems, the subdomain decomposition iterative method is applied and combined with the FB spectral-acceleration for the calculation of the surface currents on each subsurface of the sea.

In this section we focus on plasma density irregularities at scale lengths of λ > 10km, which are typically referred as “large-scale” irregularities. But they actually include mesoscale and small-scale density structures usually defined in the magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere (M-I-T) system (see Section 1.2). We will examine two categories of irregularities: plasma density enhancements and depletions, discuss how they contribute to space weather, and their role in cross-scale coupling in the M-I-T system. Section 3.2 In this part of the chapter, we discuss the state-of-the-art models to investigate different ionospheric fluid instabilities in the F region and their effect on satellite navigation signals. We also elucidate the linear and nonlinear evolution of some of the typical instabilities with examples and their observational signatures. We discuss remote sensing of the instabilities to simulate observable effects on the ground. Finally, we leave the reader with potential topics of research in this fairly old, yet vastly unresolved area of research.

"maritime border security using sensors, processing, and platforms to detect dark vessels","2018","Maritime security is critical to national prosperity, but with a large area to be secured and limited resources available, our current maritime situational awareness is not sufficient to secure our borders. This challenge is compounded by the fact that many bad actors intentionally avoid using transponders to obscure their location and actions for nefarious purposes. New solutions are required to detect these â€œdarkâ€ vessels in the expansive maritime domain and thereby enable increased maritime situational awareness and security. In this paper, we present a concept for increased maritime situational awareness, specifically designed to secure our borders against dark vessels using a novel combination of existing technologies.

"joint stochastic prediction of vessel kinematics and destination based on a maritime traffic graph","2022","Maritime traffic increases every year, and therefore also the amount of traffic data from the Automatic Identification System (AIS). Utilizing these data on traffic patterns and possible destinations for long-term vessel prediction is here an important way of gaining maritime situational awareness (MSA) for use in the decision making in autonomous ships, such as collision avoidance algorithms, which can reduce collision risk during voyage. In this article, we present a destination inference method based on piece-wise Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) processes for predicting vessel motions along common traffic lanes toward a set of destinations. The mean velocities of the processes are inferred through the creation of a maritime graph that represents the major traffic patterns in the area of consideration. After using an OU process for prediction along major sea lanes, the Equilibrium Reverting Velocity (ERV) bridging model is used to enable convergence of the prediction towards considered destinations. Then, based on the OU process and ERV bridging model for prediction, Bayesian inference is used to estimate the posterior destination distribution. Tested on a real-time AIS dataset, the method is shown to perform better than current state-of-the art methods in destination inference as it indirectly takes land and passed destinations into account.","Traffic control,mean velocities,Prediction algorithms,vessel kinematics,Bayes methods,equilibrium reverting velocity bridging model,Destination inference,traffic patterns,posterior destination distribution,Stochastic processes,Predictive models,traffic lanes,sea lanes,maritime situational awareness,long-term vessel prediction,piece-wise Ornstein-Uhlenbeck,Mechatronics,ships,marine safety,automatic identification system,marine engineering,stochastic processes,joint stochastic prediction,collision risk,maritime graph,real-time AIS dataset,maritime graphs,traffic data,Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes,vessel motions,maritime traffic graph,decision making,collision avoidance algorithms,Bayesian inference,Real-time systems,graph theory,ERV bridging model,telecommunication traffic,inference mechanisms,traffic engineering computing,Navigation,collision avoidance,OU process,AIS data,destination inference method,autonomous ships,"
"estimation of the contributions of the sources driving pm2.5 levels in a central mediterranean coastal town","2018","Receptor modelling techniques are widely used in order to identify the main natural and anthropogenic processes driving aerosol levels at a receptor. In this work, Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) was used to apportion PM2.5 levels at a traffic site (Msida) located in a coastal town. 180 filters collected throughout a yearly sampling campaign conducted in 2016, were chemically characterized by light absorbance analysis, x-ray fluorescence and ion chromatography in order to determine the concentrations of black carbon, 17 elements and 5 ions, respectively. The resulting chemical data base was used in conjunction with PMF in order to identify the 7 components affecting the PM2.5 levels at the receptor site. Six of these sources are considered to be typical of the atmospheric composition of coastal traffic sites: traffic (27.3%), ammonium sulfate (23.6%), Saharan dust (15%), aged sea salt (12.7%), shipping (5%) and fresh sea salt (4.6%). This is the first time that such a study was carried out in Malta and helps in understanding the aerosol pollution climate of the Central Mediterranean, which is still relatively understudied when compared to the Eastern and Western Mediterranean. Furthermore, we have isolated a factor exclusive to Malta: the fireworks component, which is responsible for 2.9% of the PM2.5 and which has health implications due to its chemical composition. The results of this work should also serve to guide the policy makers in achieving the necessary emission reductions in order to achieve the WHO guideline for PM2.5 by 2020.","PM,Positive matrix factorization,Natural aerosol sources,Anthropogenic aerosol sources,Source apportionment,Central mediterranean,"

"intelligent edge-enabled efficient multi-source data fusion for autonomous surface vehicles in maritime internet of things","2022","With the rapid development of low-end Internet of Things (IoT) devices and shipborne sensors, efficient multi-source data fusion methods for autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) have recently attracted significant research interest in intelligent edge-enabled maritime applications. The data fusion capacity can enhance the situation awareness of ASVs, leading to improved efficacy and safety in ASV-empowered maritime IoT (MIoT). Both cameras and automatic identification system (AIS) equipment, which provide visual and positioning information, respectively, have become the commonly adopted cost-effective sensors. In this work, we first introduce a lightweight YOLOX-s network with transfer learning to accurately and robustly detect the moving vessels at different scales in real time. A data augmentation method is then proposed to promote its generalization ability. The detected vessels and synchronous AIS messages are finally fused to make full use of the multi-source sensing data, contributing to an augmented reality (AR)-based maritime navigation system at the shipborne intelligent edges. The AR system is able to superimpose both static and dynamic information from the collected AIS messages onto the video-captured images. It has the capacity of providing auxiliary information for early warning of navigation risks for ASVs in MIoT networks. Compared with traditional single-sensor-based navigation methods, our data fusion framework exhibits more reliable and robust results, and appears to have substantial practical potential applications.

"efficient lidar-based object segmentation and mapping for maritime environments","2019","This paper proposes a method that utilizes a 3-D occupancy grid to efficiently map a large area while retaining simple representations of objects for path planning and provide spatial characteristics of objects, which may be used for object classification. To enable large-scale mapping of objects, a region around the unmanned surface vehicle (USV) is defined where a high density of LiDAR returns is expected, termed the visibility horizon. The polygon intersection between the visibility horizon and the newly detected objects is computed, as well as the polygon subtraction of the visibility horizon from the mapped list of polygons. The two polygon lists are then combined using a polygon union operation, with the objects retaining class designations. The result is a 2-D map that contains polygon representations of objects, where the object is described with a tunable number of vertices and may have an associated object class. Thus, providing necessary information for path planning and tasking.

"contrasting glacimarine sedimentary environments of two arctic fiords on disko, west greenland","1998","Two fiords, Kangerluk and Akulliit, on the island of Disko, central West Greenland have very different sedimentary regimes caused by differences in the characteristics of their drainage basins and in the exposure of their waters to the open sea of Baffin Bay. Their insular location also results in much lower input of water and sediment than in nearby fiords on the mainland of Greenland that are affected by glaciers from the Greenland Ice Cap. Akulliit has a small drainage basin and low input of water and sediment; it is directly exposed to the higher energy wave environment of Baffin Bay. As a consequence, the mean thickness of Holocene glacimarine sediment assessed in acoustic records is less than 6 m in the inner and middle reaches of the fiord (mean Holocene accumulation, 0.4 mm/a) and about 11 m (1 mm/a) near the mouth. Dated core sediment indicates that rates are less than 0.5 mm/a in the outer fiord in the last 2 ka. The larger, more glacier-covered drainage basin of Kangerluk contributes much larger loads of sediment to a fiord environment protected from the open sea. As a result, Holocene glacimarine sediment is more than 80 m thick in the inner fiord (mean Holocene accumulation up to 5 mm/a), decreasing to 10–40 m (about 1 mm/a) in the middle reaches. Accumulation rates in Kangerluk are within the range of arctic fiords, including those of Baffin Island, but those in Akulliit are near the lower limit. The decrease in thickness distally in Kangerluk is typical of arctic fiords, but the opposite trend in Akulliit is probably due to erosion and re-distribution of sediment in the higher energy environment there.","sediment,fiord,oceanography,Greenland,"
"joint optimization of trajectory and power allocation for usv-assisted maritime wireless network","2021","Unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) have attracted significant interest recently in maritime wireless communication. This paper studies a USV-assisted maritime wireless network where the USV is employed to support the communication connection between the terrestrial base station (TBS) and ship. Considering the maritime environment characteristic and earth curvature, we establish a systematic USV kinetics and information transmission model. An expected throughput maximization problem is then formulated, where the USV trajectory and power allocation are jointly considered, subject to the constraints of kinematics, safe sailing, line-of-sight (LoS) link distances, power allocation, and information-causality. Due to the complexity of the maritime two-ray signal propagation model, we propose a channel approximation method to find the upper bound of the throughput.

"learning maritime obstacle detection from weak annotations by scaffolding","2022","Coastal water autonomous boats rely on robust perception methods for obstacle detection and timely collision avoidance. The current state-of-the-art is based on deep segmentation networks trained on large datasets. Per-pixel ground truth labeling of such datasets, however, is labor-intensive and expensive. We observe that far less information is required for practical obstacle avoidance - the location of water edge on static obstacles like shore and approximate location and bounds of dynamic obstacles in the water is sufficient to plan a reaction. We propose a new scaffolding learning regime (SLR) that allows training obstacle detection segmentation networks only from such weak annotations, thus significantly reducing the cost of ground-truth labeling. Experiments show that maritime obstacle segmentation networks trained using SLR substantially outperform the same networks trained with dense ground truth labels, despite a significant reduction in labelling effort.

"an improved nearest point based location routing protocol for maritime wireless mesh networks","2019","Maritime wireless mesh network (MWMN) has merged as a remarkable solution to provide the network service for a growing number of marine users. One of the most crucial issues in a MWMN is the appropriate routing decision, which can contribute to efficient and reliable communication.

In this paper, we propose an Improved Nearest Point based Location Routing (INPLR) protocol for an intermittently connected MWMN, with a joint consideration of the expected delivery time and sea condition. We first estimate the movement range of the destination, then develop a carrying and forwarding metric (CFM) based on the concept of nearest point. Subsequently, the ship with the minimum value of CFM is selected as the packet carrier. Moreover, the retransmission mechanism is applied to reduce the packet loss.

"radar detection of low-altitude targets in a maritime environment","1995","Results from a unique analytical and experimental effort to assess low-altitude, short-range, radar detection capabilities in an evaporation ducting environment are presented. Within the horizon, the duct may shift the location of the last interference null several kilometers in range, which may cause nondetection at ranges where detection is expected and detection at ranges where detection is not expected. In addition, the evaporation duct may reduce the signal strength at ranges near the last interference peak so that detection of low-altitude, small-size, targets may not be possible until the target is much closer. At ranges near and beyond the horizon, radar signal strength depends both on the surface layer and on the mixed layer. To accurately model propagation in this region, knowledge of both surface layer and upper air meteorology Is required. An empirical model to merge the surface layer with the mixed layer has been developed.

"seabird colonies as relevant sources of pollutants in antarctic ecosystems: part 1 - trace elements","2018","Global distillation is classically pointed as the biggest responsible for contaminant inputs in Polar ecosystems. Mercury (Hg) and other trace elements (TEs) also present natural sources, whereas the biologically mediated input is typically ignored. However, bioaccumulation and biomagnification combined with the fact that seabirds gather in large numbers into large colonies and excrete on land might represent an important local TEs input. A previous work suggested these colonies as sources of not only nutrients, but also organic contaminants. To evaluate a similar hypothesis for TEs, samples of lichen (n = 55), mosses (n = 58) and soil (n = 37) were collected in 13 locations within the South Shetlands Archipelago during the austral summers of 2013–14 and 2014–15. They were divided in: 'colony' (within the colony itself for soil and bordering it for vegetation) and 'control' (at least 50 m away from colony interference), analysed for TEs (As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, Mn, Ni, Pb, Se, V, and Zn) and stable isotopes (C and N). In most cases, soil seems the best matrix to assess colonies as TEs sources, as it presented more differences between control/colony sites than vegetation. Colonies are clearly local sources of organic matter, Cd, Hg and likely of As, Se and Zn. Conversely, Co, Cr, Ni and Pb come presumably from other sources, natural or anthropogenic. In general, isotopes were more useful for interpreting vegetation data due to fractionation of absorbed animal-derived organic matter. Other local Hg sources could be inferred from high levels in control sites, location and wind patterns.","Heavy metals,Secondary sources,Stable isotopes,Inorganic contaminants,Antarctica,Trace elements,"

A system of strategically placed readers combined with satellite or cellular communications and redundant technologies ensures that security breaches are detected early and reliably anywhere along the supply chain. iCargo provides a GPS trace of where a container has travelled and where the container might have been opened. Deviations from the expected itinerary in time and/or distance are detected and the container can be flagged for physical inspection. Such a system helps borders authorities to focus their energy on suspicious cargo with the overall impact of speeding the flow of all cargo. iCargo uses a patented technique to convert the metal structure of the container into an antenna thereby allowing it to be installed behind the rubber seal of the door in a truly covert fashion. Other technologies are visible from the exterior and vulnerable to tampering and damage during container handling. The location within the door gasket is ideal for monitoring the door open/close status as well as for acting as a communications gateway to optional internal sensors. There are approximately 7 million maritime containers entering/leaving North America every year. The interiors of such containers are rarely inspected. Such containers may include contraband, hazmats, weapons or illegal items that present an economic or security risk. Despite significant security improvements since Sept-11th, only 5% of the maritime containers go through physical inspection. The use of the iCargo mounted on a container at the point of departure will assist government authorities in making better decisions about which containers to inspect thereby speeding up the overall throughput of all containers. In today's lean economy, goods in transit do not contribute to economic growth but instead are added costs to customers and shippers. With rising fuel and transportation costs, delays at borders are becoming increasingly expensive. Early detection via the iCargo system will help to reduce these costs by not only helping to shorten inspection delays but by also allowing officials to focus their energy on suspicious cargo thereby improving border security. Tektrap has been selected for the Pool of Pre-qualified Proposals for the Canadian Innovation Commercialization Program (CICP). CICP is a very competitive program that targets recent innovations, especially in the field of national security, which are ready for the beta phase of product development. Within this award, iCargo will be evaluated during spring and early summer 2012 by Canada Border Services Agency for Canadian-US border application, by Defense Research and Development Canada, DND, for land, rail and air applications in the Canada Nordic environment, and by Transport Canada for trans-Canada land/rail and Asia-Canada sea conditions.

"a multi-proxy approach to late holocene fluctuations of tungnahryggsjökull glaciers in the tröllaskagi peninsula (northern iceland)","2019","The Tröllaskagi Peninsula in northern Iceland hosts more than a hundred small glaciers that have left a rich terrestrial record of Holocene climatic fluctuations in their forelands. Traditionally, it has been assumed that most of the Tröllaskagi glaciers reached their Late Holocene maximum extent during the Little Ice Age (LIA). However, there is evidence of slightly more advanced pre-LIA positions. LIA moraines from Iceland have been primary dated mostly through lichenometric dating, but the limitations of this technique do not allow dating of glacial advances prior to the 18th or 19th centuries. The application of 36Cl Cosmic-Ray Exposure (CRE) dating to Tungnahryggsjökull moraine sequences in Vesturdalur and Austurdalur (central Tröllaskagi) has revealed a number of pre-LIA glacial advances at ~400 and ~700 CE, and a number of LIA advances in the 15th and 17th centuries, the earliest LIA advances dated so far in Tröllaskagi. This technique hence shows that the LIA chronology in Tröllaskagi agrees with that of other European areas such as the Alps or the Mediterranean mountains. The combined use of lichenometric dating, aerial photographs, satellite images and fieldwork shows that the regional colonization lag of the commonly used lichen species Rhizocarpon geographicum is longer than previously assumed. For exploratory purposes, an alternative lichen species (Porpidia soredizodes) has been tested for lichenometric dating, estimating a tentative growth rate of 0.737 mm yr−1.","Lichenometric dating,Late Holocene glacier evolution,Little Ice Age,Tröllaskagi,Iceland,Cl Cosmic-Ray Exposure dating,"
"a survey of mobility-aware multi-access edge computing: challenges, use cases and future directions","2023","Many mobile and pervasive applications avail cloud services to reduce overheads in on-device computation. The performance of these services depends on the available bandwidth of the underlying network, the physical proximity of the cloud server and the end devices, the volume of data, the computational capacity of the server, and, importantly, the mobility of the devices hosting the applications. Edge computing promises to provide better performance by bringing services (e.g., a video streaming service) from the cloud to servers near the user. It also enables partial or full offloading of the computation (tasks) and storage functionalities from the User Equipment (UE) to the edge of the network. This saves power and benefits from relatively more powerful devices at the edge. Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC), which supports wireless and wired access technologies, has gained significant research interest. When UEs move, services must continue to operate, tasks may need to be offloaded again, and states related to tasks and services may need to be migrated. In this paper, we focus on four functional components (task/service offloading, resource allocation, content/task caching, and service/task migration) of MEC. We survey the challenges to these and their solutions in the context of UE mobility. Mobility creates challenges during offloading resource-intensive tasks as the user may move while the task is being offloaded. Some of the other challenges are how to jointly allocate computing and communication resources, minimize service down time during migration, and share the backhaul network if the same MEC host must continue to be used. Some key research areas include intelligent task offloading and service migration algorithms, exploiting group mobility to improve task migration time, studying the interplay of MEC parameters such as capabilities of the target MEC host, etc. In addition, predicting the mobile trajectory through intelligent methods and implementations with datasets from real-world scenarios are required. We compare this paper on 11 parameters (service migration, task offloading, resource allocation, content caching, mobility, use cases, architecture, computing paradigm, mobility model, system model, virtualization/Software Defined Networks) with 31 other survey papers from 2018 to April 2022 in MEC and related domains. We discuss the Edge Computing paradigm, the system architecture and model descriptions, and use cases. We briefly explain the relevant challenges and future directions in emerging domains, such as the Internet of drones and Digital twins. We also discuss future research directions in task/service migration, offloading, resource management, distributed computing, reliability, and Quality of Service, all related to mobility in MEC.","Service migration,Multi-access Edge Computing,Resource allocation,Mobility,Task offloading,Content caching,"
"fault detection and diagnosis of a blade pitch system in a floating wind turbine based on kalman filters and artificial neural networks","2021","This paper describes the development of a fault detection and diagnosis method to automatically identify different fault conditions of a hydraulic blade pitch system in a spar-type floating wind turbine. For fault detection, a Kalman filter is employed to estimate the blade pitch angle and valve spool position of the blade pitch system. The fault diagnosis scheme is based on an artificial neural network method with supervised learning that is capable of diagnosing a predetermined fault type. The neural network algorithm produces a predictive model with training, validation and test procedures after the final performance evaluation. The validation and test procedures of the artificial neural network model are conducted with the training model to prove the model performance. The proposed method is demonstrated in case studies of a spar floating wind turbine with stochastic wind and wave conditions and with consideration of six different types of faults, such as biases and fixed outputs in pitch sensors and excessive friction, slit-lock, wrong voltage, and circuit shortage in actuators. The fault diagnosis results from the final performance evaluation show that the proposed methods work effectively with good performance.","Kalman filter,Floating wind turbine,Blade pitch actuator and sensor faults,Hydraulic pitch system,Artificial neural network,Fault detection and diagnosis,"
"fitting empirical distributions for vessels behavioural analysis and maritime anomaly detection","2023","Naval behaviour characterization and maritime anomaly detection represents two active area of research. Although multiple probabilistic approaches have been implemented for explaining different parametric maritime phenomena, most of them are focused only on the analysis of primary kinematic data, such as position, speed, course of vessels, or lateral displacement relative to an obstacle. This article presents an analysis on multiple complex maritime activities (e.g., fishing, drifting, hidden activities) that were derived by processing AIS messages collected in the Black Sea region. Quantitative histograms were made for each type of activity while probability and cumulative distribution functions were plotted using kernel density estimation applications. After that, multiple evaluation metrics analysed the possibilities of representing these distributions in the form of known parametric distributions (e.g., Gaussian, Gamma, Rayleigh, Log-normal). Finally, there were extracted the parameters that best fitted these distributions. Also, a universal parametric distribution was searched to best fit all observed maritime activities.","statistical distributions,universal parametric distribution,kernel density estimation applications,Safety,primary kinematic data,AIS messages,vessel behavioural analysis,Sea measurements,cumulative distribution functions,parametric maritime phenomena,probabilistic approaches,quantitative histograms,marine engineering,hidden activities,AIS,vessels behaviour,Probabilistic logic,Probability distribution,probability distribution fitting,Measurement,maritime anomaly detection,Statistical analysis,empirical distributions,naval behaviour characterization,Fitting,Black Sea region,empirical data,data handling,multiple complex maritime activities,"

"maritime field trial of a dual-band silicon integrated photonics-based radar","2022","This paper reports the development, the complete characterization, and the first outdoor field trial of a coherent dual-band photonics-based radar implemented through integrated photonic circuits. The dual band radar transceiver has been implemented on a silicon-on-insulator platform, and is capable of operating up to the Ku-band. It has been packaged and engineered on a printed circuit board for its use in a complete radar system. The electronic RF front-end in S- and X-bands and the digital baseband equipment have been developed in order to guarantee performance aligned with the state of the art of conventional radars. The developed apparatus has been characterized in S- and X-band in terms of sensitivity, linearity, phase noise, and conversion efficiency, both at chip and system level. The impact and issues related to the used fabrication platform and to the packaged approach have been analyzed. The outdoor field trial has been carried out in a relevant maritime environment close to the port of Livorno (Italy). First, X-band radar acquisitions of a complex maritime scene using a rotating antenna has allowed to verify the radar behavior by comparing the detected scene with official data provided by the automatic identification system mounted on the observed ships. A false alarm probability of 2Ã—10âˆ’5 has been demonstrated, aligned with radar state of the art.

"potential impact of long-life environmental sonobuoys on littoral asw","2009","The focus of military activity has recently shifted from large area engagements to regional conflicts. Consequently, supportive Naval maritime operations have continued to evolve toward littoral warfare in complicated shallow-water, near-shore environments. This evolution requires new sensors, advanced Concept of Operations, and improved data-analysis capabilities, among others. Planning operations in these harsh-environment areas is difficult because accurate predictions of tactical sensor performance depend on detailed knowledge of the local environmental conditions. Tactical mission planning is thus seldom optimal or efficient, often resulting in coverage gaps, increased risk, and reduced mission success. According to a Navy Mission Need Statement, 'Air ASW tactical execution, especially in littoral seas, requires in-situ environmental updates for preflight mission planning. In the conduct of ASW operations, an urgent need for explicit knowledge of environmental variables is required to optimize the effectiveness of operational acoustic sensors, as well as acoustic sensors in development ' The Naval Air Systems Command has considered extended-life environmental sonobuoy concepts to better characterize the littoral environment. Most designs contain a thermistor string to measure ocean temperatures and also hydrophones to measure ambient noise. This type of complex sonobuoy would be more expensive than a traditional single-measurement AXBT but it could provide a more thorough littoral environment assessment. This paper examines the trade-off between increased sensor complexity and improved ASW performance, in terms of cumulative detection probability. Some advantages of an extended-life combined thermistor string/hydrophone approach, compared to AXBTs and tactical hydrophones, are: 1) higher accuracy of the raw data; 2) temporal averaging to smooth out fluctuations; 3) extended area coverage during drift; 4) less chance for surface temperature anomalies (e.g., mixed-layer-depth errors) caused by various electronic and mechanical variability upon impact; 5) opportunities to discover thermal and acoustic feature boundaries during drift; and 6) less need to re-seed thus allowing longer tactical mission times. These advantages are evaluated relative to the following disadvantages: 1) increased cost; 2) potential drift outside the mission area; and 3) need for increased battery life for longer durations. The analysis is tempered by considering how a potential new system might be used. One assumption is that an environmental sampling decision aid is available to determine the minimum number and best initial locations of drifting sensors to meet performance objectives. The November 2007 Requirements Document from the Naval Oceanographic Office states ?Sampling guidance: Development of guidance on the best way to deploy, spatially and temporally, observation systems in order to meet various forecasting, model assimilation, and model evaluation objectives is needed.? Work in this area is reported in this Oceans '09 Conference in a paper entitled ?Uncertainty-based Adaptive AXBT Sampling with SPOTS?, which addresses optimal sampling requirements. For this trade-off analysis, temperature data from watersampling flights in the Sea of Japan off the east coast of Korea were used to simulate expected capability of a long-term drifting thermistor string. Then optimal initial positions for three notional buoys were determined followed by a simulation of drifting positions and data collected over 12 days. Ocean nowcasts were constructed and used to determine acoustic performance of a notional tactical sonobuoy field. The analysis shows that a drifting extended-life thermistor string can provide significant improvement in environmental characterization, tactical planning, and ASW detection performance.","Acoustic measurements,Sea measurements,military systems,Predictive models,Sonar equipment,Sampling methods,Ocean temperature,Noise measurement,littoral ASW,operational acoustic sensors,Thermistors,Temperature measurement,Acoustic sensors,long-life environmental sonobuoys,"
"the assessment of air and soil as contributors of some trace metals to vegetable plants i. use of a filtered air growth cabinet","1989","The sources of heavy metals in a number of consumer crops were investigated in the laboratory by growing plants in a dual growth cabinet supplied with both clean and ambient air. Under these conditions, plants were exposed separately to filtered and normal ambient air to assess the influences of soil and atmosphere on the accumulation of Cd, Pb, Zn, Cr and Ni. Radish, carrot, pea, spinach and lettuce plants were successfully grown in the cabinet. Analysis of the metals in the plant tissues showed that the foliar route is potentially of similar importance to the soil-root pathway as a route of transport to the exposed parts of the plants. Whilst the exposed parts showed the highest metal accumulation from the air, the levels of metals in fruits and storage roots resulting from foliar translocation of the airborne component appeared to be low generally. The metal which achieved highest translocation from foliar deposition was Pb. The effect of spraying plants with rain-water was to enhance slightly the total content of all trace metals analysed.",""
"environmental challenges related to methane hydrate decomposition from climate change scenario and anthropic activities: state of the art, potential consequences and monitoring solutions","2023","Natural gas hydrate deposits (NGHD) have been investigated for decades and represent one of the major methane reservoirs on Earth. They are encountered in sediment of both the continental margins and the permafrost region; areas considered to host amongst the most climate-sensitive ecosystems on Earth. With worldwide temperature increases affecting continental margins and the permafrost, it is important to raise concern about the fate of the NGHD in the coming centuries. Thus, this review presents an overview of the potential consequences of hydrate decomposition on its surrounding areas. It compiles and discusses hydrate-derived methane fluxes measured or inferred from in situ data at several sites by considering both dissociation and dissolution. Depending on the magnitude and the duration of hydrate decomposition, the amounts of methane released can affect to varying degrees the seafloor and the microbial communities that sustain the methane cycle and regulate its transfer from the sediment to the water column; and that aspect is addressed in this review. Here, we also considered the transfer of methane from NGHDs and more broadly from marine emissions to the atmosphere, as it is assumed that such transfer will likely increase in the future. Finally, multi-scale monitoring in space and time is a key element to evaluate the impacts of natural and anthropic perturbations on NGHDs. We thus propose potential engineering solutions for the monitoring of NGHD, mainly based on the long-term deployment of sensor systems.","Permafrost and slope stability,Methane flux into the atmosphere,Gas emissions,Continental margins,Natural gas hydrate deposits,"
"incipient anomalous ionospheric divergence fast detection for coastal differential global navigation satellite system","2023","Differential Global Navigation Satellite System (DGNSS) plays an increasingly important role in the maritime field. Irregular ionospheric divergences may result in DGNSS performance degradation and increase risk in terms of positioning accuracy and navigation integrity. To speed up incipient ionospheric anomaly detection, this paper proposes a novel method for the DGNSS stations which employs (1) the Wasserstein distance (WD) to identify dissimilarity between GNSS pseudorange and carrier-phase measurements and (2) the least-mean-square (LMS) filter to smooth the calculated metrics. The combined WD-LMS is proposed to ensure the rapid identification of abnormal ionospheric divergences. Taking the multipath into account, which is especially severe in the low elevation angle case, elevation-angle related strategies are developed. Both semi-simulated and real experiments are conducted. For the high-elevation angle case, the WD-LMS is even potential to detect large ionospheric divergences within ten epochs. Therefore, the WD-LMS has encouraging potential to enhance maritime DGNSS navigation performance.","DGNSS,Marine navigation,Ionospheric divergences,"
"distribution and coalification patterns in canadian bituminous and anthracite coals","1989","Canadian resources of bituminous and anthracite coal occur in six of ten provinces and in the Yukon and Northwest Territories. These higher-rank coals are found in 12 of the 16 coal-bearing basins within Canada. For some of these basins, knowledge of rank and coalification patterns is limited; in others, it is extensive. Coalification patterns were examined in detail for two areas: the southern end of the Canadian Rocky Mountain coal belt which is underlain by the coal-bearing Kootenay Group and the Maritimes Basin which is underlain by several coal-bearing formations of Pennsylvanian (Late Carboniferous) age. In the southern Rockies, reflectances on coal range from 0.61 to 2.65% R0 max, which represent high-volatile B bituminous coal to semianthracite. In general, there is an increase in rank from SE to NW and from NE to SW. Superimposed on this pattern are several anomalies. At several locations, ranks change rapidly over short distances. An example is in the Mount Allan syncline, where the reflectances in the Kootenay section on the SW vertical limb range from 0.68 to 0.94% R0 max in contrast to a range of 1.30–2.49% R0 max for a comparable section on the NE upright limb. This variation occurs over a distance of about 3 km. Multiple intersections of Kootenay strata in oil wells at the south end of the area show low reflectances (0.76% Ro max) at depths of about 3800 m with no change in the shallower Kootenay repeats, whereas wells farther north show higher reflectances and increase with depth. Different burial depths, the influence of thick thrust plates, different paleogeothermal gradients and ground-water movements, all likely have played a part in generating these coalification patterns. A significant part of the coalification in the Kootenay Group appears to have been postdeformational. The rank of the coals in the various subbasins of the Maritimes Basin is nearly all bituminous. Evidence indicates that most of the coalification is postdeformational. Rank within a given coal bed generally increases with increase in depth of present-day burial and the pattern seems to be generally true for most of the coal fields studied. The average postdeformational component of total coalification has been calculated to be 72%. The most important coal field in the Maritimes Basin is the Sydney coal field. Here ranks have been shown to increase from NW to SE and from SW to NE, the latter direction following the downdip structure of the field. Coalification gradients for the Sydney field range from 0.052 to 0.088 R0 max/100 m, reflecting different paleogeothermal gradients. In New Brunswick, local rank increases to anthracite are believed to be related to igneous activities. Reflectance measurements have been used to interpret stratigraphy and structure in several fields and even to trace the origin of coaly fragments obtained from deep-sea drilling near Bermuda.",""
"maritime unmanned systems and janus in support to distressed submarine search & rescue: the repmus21 experience","2022","Currently, communications during submarine rescue operations are performed solely with the analogue underwater telephone and the usage of phonetic codes (Alpha to Zulu), requiring the presence of human operators.

In the maritime domain, modern TDS is connected to various sensors such as Radar, Automatic Identification System (AIS), and Tactical Data Link Processor (TDLP) where each sensor usually has its independent tracking system. The tracks of each tracker must be associated and fused so that valid and reliable information about situational awareness appears in TDS. Each of the data generated by trackers has different characteristics and problems, which prompted many researchers to formulate algorithms suitable for track associations. In this paper, we present the results of our preliminary research regarding the track association to be used in maritime TDS.

"contribution of anthropogenic and natural sources in pm10 during north african dust events in southern europe","2021","The influence of North African (NAF) dust events on the air quality at the regional level (12 representative monitoring stations) in Southern Europe during a long time series (2007–2014) was studied. PM10 levels and chemical composition were separated by Atlantic (ATL) and NAF air masses. An increase in the average PM10 concentrations was observed on sampling days with NAF dust influence (42 μg m−3) when compared to ATL air masses (29 μg m−3). Major compounds such as crustal components and secondary inorganic compounds (SIC), as well as toxic trace elements derived from industrial emissions, also showed higher concentrations of NAF events. A source contribution analysis using positive matrix factorisation (PMF) 5.0 of the PM10 chemical data, discriminating ATL and NAF air mass origins, allowed the identification of five sources: crustal, sea salt, traffic, regional, and industrial. A higher contribution (74%) of the natural sources to PM10 concentrations was confirmed under NAF episodes compared with ATL. Furthermore, there was an increase in anthropogenic sources during these events (51%), indicating the important influence of the NAF air masses on these sources. The results of this study highlight that environmental managers should take appropriate actions to reduce local emissions during NAF events to ensure good air quality.","PM10,Source contribution,North African dust,Southern Europe,"
"soil anomaly mapping using a caesium magnetometer: limits in the low magnetic amplitude case","2006","Caesium magnetometers are new tools for soil property mapping with a decimetric resolution [Mathé, V., Lévêque, F., 2003. High resolution magnetic survey for soil monitoring: detection of drainage and soil tillage effects. Earth and Planetary Science Letters 212 (1–2), 241–251]. However, when the magnetic anomalies are only a few nanoteslas (nT), the geologic and pedogenic signal must first be isolated from magnetic disturbances for this method to be useful. This paper investigates the instrumental artifacts and environmental disturbances to adapt the survey protocol to slightly magnetic soils. Among the possible instrumental sources of disturbances listed and quantified, the most significant are: 1) The battery effect upon sensors 2 m away (classic protocol, about ±0.15 nT) while increasing this distance up to 10 m cancelled it; 2) The noise level of magnetometers and sensors, which, according to tests on two magnetometers and three sensors, rarely and randomly exceeds 0.1 nT, but seems to increase with the electronic component age. Among the environmental disturbances, temporal variations such as diurnal variation or fluctuations linked to the moving of metallic masses play a major role, although the pseudogradient or base-station methods have commonly cancelled them. The efficiency of the latter is strongly dependent on the source nature. However, the ground currents and electromagnetic fields propagating in soils cause more problems. As a first step to better understand such disturbance sources, uncommon magnetic signal variations supposedly due to electromagnetic wave conversions and likely linked to the railway traffic are presented. Based on previous results, an adapted protocol using one magnetometer and two caesium sensors (0.3 and 1.6 m above the surface) is proposed to increase the signal/noise ratio. At first, to maintain an accurate horizontal and vertical location of the sensors, the latter are affixed to a wooden handcart running on plastic rails. Rails adapt to micro-topography, thereby decreasing strongly the soil–sensors distance variations. Anomalies due to topography rarely exceed 0.1 nT. Finally, a method to remove diurnal variations from high-resolution magnetic maps is proposed. Parallel profiles performed successively are adjusted by a cross-profile. Assuming that the temporal variations during each profile are negligible (less than 0.05 nT), this technique, contrary to the pseudogradient, preserves both the decimetric and the metric anomalies (gain of more than 1 nT).","Marshland soils,Survey protocol,Caesium magnetometer,High-resolution magnetic survey,Seismomagnetic wave conversions,"
"a deep learning framework for enhancing maritime coastal security","2021","The concerns of coastal security are very dynamic which depends on several factors like the neighbourhood of the country, the terrain and the marine traffic. As in the present system, only the vessels which emit Automatic Identification System (AIS) data streams can be detected and identified. Small vessels like some boats do not have AIS system setup, so they can get past without getting detected. Therefore, we propose a solution by framing a deep learning architecture namely faster region based convolutional neural network (Faster R-CNN) which accurately detects vessels in satellite images and outputs the latitude and longitude coordinates which when merged with AIS data helps identify whether the vessel is registered or not. Along with this, our paper also focuses on threat level detections from the unregistered vessels to analyze any terrorizing activity that may occur along the coastline.","Satellites,Faster Region Based Convolutional Neural Network,deep learning (artificial intelligence),maritime coastal security,Faster R-CNN,threat level detections,Sea measurements,marine safety,terrorism,marine engineering,Automatic Identification System,AIS,maritime surveillance,object detection,data streams,longitude coordinates,Haversine,neural net architecture,faster region based convolutional neural network,Real-time systems,latitude coordinates,convolutional neural nets,Tracking,terrorizing activity,Euclidian,Deep learning,Surveillance,deep learning architecture,vessel,Security,AIS data,"

However, due to the broadcast characteristics of wireless signals, the information in the legitimate link may be eavesdropped by eavesdroppers. This paper considers a maritime edge computing system with an eavesdropper where unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) and an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) cooperate to offload and compute tasks. The task offloading and resource scheduling problem is modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP), in which the objective is to maximize the overall performance of the system with the consideration of the physical layer security (PLS). An offloading decision is made based on the channel qualities between USVs and UAV, task queue status and task information of USVs. In order to deal with the high-dimensional curse of state and action space, we propose a computational offloading algorithm based on the twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) to learn the optimal strategy without requiring a priori knowledge of the environment.

Two different representations for the routes are provided: (1) clusters of AIS contacts, and (2) route prototypes, representing the nominal trajectory of the vessels following the route. Additionally, a set of tracklets (built by five consecutive AIS contacts from the same vessel trajectory) has been extracted from the set of routes and the original dataset, and labelled either with the route name to which they belong or as off-route tracklets. This dataset provides thus some ground truth on the routes followed by vessels and is aimed at testing and validating vessel-to-route or track-to-route association algorithms.","Track-to-route association,Vessel-to-route association,Route prototypes,Maritime routes,Automatic identification system,"
"chapter 15 - dynamics, assessment, and management of exploited natural scallop populations","2016","This chapter reviews advances made in the study of the structure and dynamics of scallop populations and in the development of new approaches for the assessment and management of exploited scallop stocks. Significant progress in the understanding of larval transport and connectivity of scallop populations has been achieved in recent years through the use of coupled biophysical modelling in combination with novel population genetics techniques. The assessment of abundance and distribution of scallops stocks has benefitted from recent technological developments, particularly in the fields of acoustics and underwater photography. These developments have led to mapping scallop distributions in relation to bottom type characterisations obtained from multi-beam sonar data, groundtruthed using conventional in situ sampling, including underwater imagery. Underwater cameras have also become more common, replacing conventional fishing gears used for periodic monitoring surveys. Management has increasingly focused on spatial harvesting strategies that recognise the existence of spatial gradients in scallop productivity, the non-random allocation of fishing effort and the large inter-annual variability that is typical of scallop recruitment. The use of management strategy evaluation methods to design harvest control rules that are suited to the fishery specific characteristics, and monitoring capabilities is a promising area of new development. Concerns about habitat impacts of dredges and trawls used for harvesting scallops have received much scientific attention as the scope of fisheries assessment has expanded beyond the target species to include broader ecological effects of fishing.","Scallops,scallop stock assessment,scallop fishery management,population dynamics,sessile invertebrates,"
"minimum winter temperature reconstruction from average earlywood vessel area of european oak (quercus robur) in n-poland","2016","Tree-ring-based temperature reconstructions form a substantial part of the international proxy data base used to examine and model global climate variations of the last Millennium. However, most tree-ring-based reconstructions are derived from study sites in the high latitudes or high altitudes, paying very little attention to low elevation sites. Thus, a large gap in the geographical coverage of climate reconstructions from temperate low elevation sites in central Europe still exists. This motivated us to concentrate our efforts on the European oak (Quercus robur) in N-Poland. We developed a new robust tree-ring width chronology (TRW), as well as four wood anatomical chronologies (e.g. average vessel area and number of vessels) from Q. robur for the period 1810 to 2010. The chronologies were examined for their climatological responses. While TRW was found to have weak correlations with climate, the earlywood vessel parameters (EVP), especially average vessel area (AVA), revealed significant positive correlations to minimum winter temperatures. Based on stable climate–growth correlations, a reconstruction of minimum winter temperatures (29th November to 20th January) back to 1810 was performed for north Poland. The reconstruction indicates a promising potential to reveal low-frequency climate information. An additional extreme year analysis suggested that in cold winters, a cold–warm–cold pattern in the minimum temperatures was responsible for the relatively small earlywood vessels. Spatial field correlations imply that our reconstruction is more related to temperature variations towards the east of Europe. The reconstructed temperature compared well with two existing temperature reconstructions, especially during most of the 20th century, even though the temperature reconstructions differ spatially and temporally. Based on these findings, the relatively extensive resource of archeological oak material from this region may be useful to perform multicentennial climate reconstructions in the temperate climate zone.","Temperature reconstruction,Poland,Temperate lowlands,Wood anatomy,Dendroclimatology,Earlywood vessel parameter,"
"resource management of maritime edge nodes for collected data feedback","2020","With the development of marine economy, more marine applications emerge leading to more deployed sensors and more generated data. However, current marine Internet only provides low transmission rate constrained by limited communication resources and bad transmission environment. How to efficiently use these resources and guarantee quality-of-service (QoS) of applications need to be addressed. This paper proposes an online optimization resource management algorithm to improve the communication resource efficiency with guaranteed QoSs for different applications. This algorithm needs neither of the resource cost function nor QoS constraint function at the resource scheduling node. Furthermore, the gradient information, which is usually needed in learning strategies, is not required either. Instead, this algorithm performs resource management of both computation and communication resources in each time slot only based on the observation of the last time slot. With slot-by-slot resource allocation, the communication cost can be minimized to be suitable for maritime scenarios. In the meantime, a long-term delay constraint can be satisfied. Results show that the proposed algorithm achieves the goal of reducing communication cost while guaranteeing the delay-constraint of different applications. Although more computation resources will improve its performance, this algorithm still can obtain the minimized cost given a low computation resource.","Image edge detection,marine applications,guaranteed QoSs,long-term delay constraint,quality of service,Delays,time slot,online optimization resource management algorithm,Resource management,gradient information,telecommunication scheduling,resource scheduling node,communication cost minimization,Online resource management,resource cost function,Quality of service,learning strategies,data feedback,optimisation,communication resources,computation resources,low computation resource,communication resource efficiency,edge computing,marine economy,maritime edge nodes,collected data feedback,Bandwidth,quality-of-service,communication cost reduction,current marine Internet,low transmission rate,marine communication,Scheduling,slot-by-slot resource allocation,Internet,resource allocation,maritime communications,QoS constraint function,bad transmission environment,"

"evidence for a “little ice age” glacial advance within the antarctic peninsula – examples from glacially-overrun raised beaches","2021","Recognition of how dynamic the Antarctic ice sheets and glaciers were during the late Holocene has grown in recent years. Proxy data suggests the presence of Neoglacial advances but few moraines or glacial features from this time have been dated compared to glaciated landscapes of the Northern Hemisphere. Debate continues on whether parts of Antarctica experienced glacial advance at the same time as the “Little Ice Age” (LIA), which is well-documented in the Northern Hemisphere. We provide new evidence for late Holocene glacial fluctuations at three locations along the Antarctic Peninsula. A moraine or till sheet from a tidewater glacier cross cuts a series of dated raised beaches at Tay Head, Joinville Island along the northwestern Weddell Sea. At Spark Point, on Greenwich Island, a glacier has overrun Holocene raised beaches and a shell-bearing marine deposit is reworked into a glacial diamicton. A third site in Calmette Bay within the larger Marguerite Bay also contains a recent moraine that cuts across a series of dated raised beach ridges. The new ages constraining these glacial advances are in broad agreement with the handful of other existing ages on moraines and proxy records suggestive of cooler conditions within the Antarctic Peninsula. Combining available timing constraints into a Bayesian model yields an age of 400 to 90 cal BP (1550–1860 CE; 95%) for the LIA across the Antarctica Peninsula. Consideration of a two-phase glacial advance within our Bayesian framework does fit more of the data from across the Antarctic Peninsula and suggests advances from 575 to 330 cal BP (1375–1620 CE) and 400 to 50 cal BP (1550–1900 CE). However, more work is needed to determine if such a two-phase advance occurred. Regardless, its similar timing within the Antarctic Peninsula to that of the Northern Hemisphere supports recent assertions of a volcanic or solar forcing for the LIA. These recent readvances also provide a possible mechanism for changes in the rates of Holocene relative sea-level change recorded across the Antarctic Peninsula suggesting that the Antarctic ice sheets may have been more responsive to past climate changes than previously thought and glacial isostatic adjustment from the LIA and possibly other Holocene glacial oscillations is superimposed upon the longer relaxation from the Last Glacial Maximum.","Coast,Shallow marine,Neoglacial,Sea level,Glacial advance,Holocene,Antarctica,Climate change,"

"trial results of a new low-cost and covert technology to trace the path of maritime containers worldwide","2008","There are approximately 7 million maritime style containers within Canada, and 70 million within the USA. The interiors of such containers are rarely inspected. With market globalization, a large amount of these containers enter North America on a daily basis. Such containers may include contraband or dangerous items that present an economic or security risk. Despite significant security improvements, only 3 to 5% of the maritime containers, that arrive in or transition through North America, go through physical inspection. Current container tracking technologies based on GPS consume high DC power, are costly, require line-of-sight with satellites and they are often too large to be covert. It is possible to overcome some of these limitations by basing the tracking system on the FM broadcast signal which is an alternative man-made signal that is reasonably ubiquitous, provides a geographically unique frequency spectrum and is about 100,000 as strong as a GPS satellite signal. This allows the development of a low cost, low power and miniature FM receiver that can record frequency spectrums and compare them to known data in order to trace the path that the container has taken for less than 10$ per container. This paper presents the first results of highway trials (train and sea trials are to be conducted in 2009) of such a low cost, covert, non-GPS based technology (called 'FM Tag') that records the worldwide displacement of containers and displays the path undertaken by the container while in transit. As an added security benefit, the tag is also capable of detecting container door openings. In addition to presenting the first trial results, this paper covers the innovative engineering aspects of using the metal enclosure of a maritime container as a VHF antenna, thereby eliminating the need to add an external antenna and achieving the goal of being 100% covert.","Maritime container traceability,Costs,Inspection,low-cost covert technology,Global Positioning System,FM broadcast signal,ships,Containers,alternative man-made signal,high DC power,Maritime container intrusion sensor and Article traceability,Globalization,market globalization,maritime containers path,GPS,Satellite broadcasting,North America,Frequency,Power generation economics,Security,"

"an investigation of atmospheric mercury accumulated in the snow cover from the urbanized coastal zone of the baltic sea, poland","2014","The preliminary research on Hg snow chemistry was conducted in the industrially-impacted region of the southern Baltic Sea during winter campaigns in 2008 and 2009. Mercury content in urban snow samples was quantitatively determined through the use of an atomic absorption technique. The average total Hg concentration value in shallow snow cover from the urbanized coastal zone of the Baltic Sea was calculated to be 8.6 ng L−1. A strong relationship between the anthropogenic emission factors (contribution from local and regional coal combustion processes) and low temperature was identified for all the examined snow episodes. The highest Hg concentration in the urban snow samples was observed during the southern advection, which indicated that local/regional anthropogenic emission predominantly affected the Hg deposition. Other environmental variables (meteorological and chemical) were also investigated to establish the most important atmospheric processes and sources of Hg in the urban snow cover and to assess the changes in atmospheric Hg chemistry during the winter season.","Coal combustion,Snowfall,Air pollution,Atmospheric transport,Sources,Hg,"

"advection pathways at the mt. cimone wmo-gaw station: seasonality, trends, and influence on atmospheric composition","2020","Relationships are analysed between advection pathways and atmospheric composition at the high-mountain station of Mt. Cimone (Italy), between 1998 and 2011. Back-trajectory cluster analysis identifies eight main advection pathways. A connection is demonstrated between the seasonality of airmass transport and atmospheric composition. Temporal trends and correlation of variables, flow types and teleconnection indices show, among other, decreasing trends of 210Pb (a radionuclide of crustal origin; −0.008 mBq m−3 year−1) as well as PM10 (−0.15 μg m−3 year−1), indicating that previously observed downward PM10 trends in Europe may actually be attributable to a combination of meteorological factors and decreasing anthropogenic emissions. The detection of a positive (negative) correlation of these tracers with Western (Arctic) air masses, showing significant downward (upward) trends at the study site, further confirms our findings. Lastly, relationships between teleconnection indices and atmospheric transport types/atmospheric variables are further analysed, focusing on large-scale atmospheric circulation indices and regional low-frequency atmospheric circulation pathways, the Mediterranean Oscillation and the Western Mediterranean Oscillation. The analysis reveals the important influence of such regional indices on the advection pathways.","Atmospheric radiotracers,Aerosol,Back-trajectories,Teleconnection,Trends,"

In this paper, we propose a single maritime image defogging algorithm based on illumination decomposition. First, we decompose a foggy input image into glow and glow-free layers by formulating an optimization problem and then solving it effectively, where the optimization variables are updated by closed-form solutions. Then, the fog components in the glow-free layer are removed using a defogging algorithm. Finally, the natural illumination in the glow layer is recovered using a compensation scheme to obtain the final fog-free image. Experimental results on real test images demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of both subjective and objective evaluation criteria.","illumination decomposition,Periodic structures,fog component removal,Lighting,single image defogging,image enhancement,Maritime image defogging,natural illumination,Image color analysis,land images,glow-free layer,fog,Atmospheric modeling,Scattering,single maritime image defogging,optimisation,image texture,lighting,fog-free image,optimization,image restoration,structure prior,texture prior,compensation scheme,foggy input image decomposition,Laplace equations,"
"nowhere to hide? passive, non-cooperative maritime surveillance from a nanosat","2018","Non-cooperative tracking of shipping from space has traditionally been the preserve of state actors. Recent progress in nanosat and SDR technology raises the possibility of conducting such surveillance from low-cost space platforms. While ships may switch off beacons in order to obscure their location, they cannot proceed safely without their navigation radar systems being operational. Radar emissions may be recorded to achieve geolocation. As the radar antenna is mechanically rotated, a periodic power peak is observed by a fixed receiver. A receiver in LEO will record differing interception times according to its motion and that of the emitter platform. A least squares estimator is used to compare possible emitter locations with the collected data in order to arrive at the most probable geolocation. The highly constrained geometry of the system reduces the search to a 1-dimensional one which significantly reduces the processing power required for a fast answer. It is suggested that power reduction resulting from a new algorithm, coupled with advances in nanosat and SDR technology enables a low-cost demonstrator mission. Additionally, using only one satellite removes the requirement for high-speed data links, further reducing weight and power needs. Accuracies of better than 20km have been recorded in simulations.","Satellites,surveillance,least square estimator,marine radar,nanosat,Radar antennas,Marine vehicles,radar antennas,low-cost demonstrator mission,LEO,high-speed data links,power reduction,satellite communication,ships,maritime surveillance,Frequency measurement,emitter locations,radar antenna,noncooperative tracking,least squares approximations,SDR technology,software radio,Geology,radar emissions,low-cost space platforms,Spaceborne radar,radionavigation,"

"storm surges in the mediterranean sea: variability and trends under future climatic conditions","2015","The trends of storm surge extremes in the Mediterranean Sea for a period of 150 years (1951–2100) are explored, using a high-resolution storm surge model. Numerical simulations are forced by the output of regional climate simulations with RegCM3, which uses IPCC’s historical data on greenhouse gasses emissions for the (past) period 1951–2000, and IPCC’s A1B climate scenario for the (future) period 2001–2100. Comparisons between observations and modeling results show good agreement and confirm the ability of our model to estimate the response of the sea surface to future climatic conditions. We investigate the future trends, the variability and frequency of local extremes and the main forcing mechanisms that can induce strong surges in the Mediterranean region. Our results support that there is a general decreasing trend in storminess under the considered climate scenario, mostly related to the frequency of local peaks and the duration and spatial coverage of the storm surges. The northward shift in the location of storm tracks is a possible reason for this storminess attenuation, especially over areas where the main driving factor of extreme events is the inverted barometer effect. However, the magnitudes of sea surface elevation extremes may increase in several Mediterranean sub-regions, i.e., Southern Adriatic, Balearic and Tyrrhenian Seas, during the 21st century. There are clear distinctions in the contributions of winds and pressure fields to the sea level height for various regions of the Mediterranean Sea, as well as on the seasonal variability of extreme values; the Aegean and Adriatic Seas are characteristic examples, where high surges are predicted to be mainly induced by low pressure systems and favorable winds, respectively.","Mediterranean sea,Climate change,Storm surge,Hydrodynamic modeling,"

Year-to-year variations of the averaged austral winter HIX (July–September), representative of the main upwelling season, were compared with (i) corresponding averages of the geostrophic alongshore component of the south-east trade wind (SET) between St. Helena Island in the south-west and Luanda/Angola in the north-east, (ii) the meridional distribution of surface waters colder than 13 °C to characterise intense Benguela upwelling (IBU), and (iii) the meridional position of the Angola-Benguela Frontal Zone (ABFZ) determined by means of sea surface temperature images for offshore distances between 50 and 400 km. Temporal changes of these parameters were investigated and showed that the frequency of consecutive years of strong and relaxed Benguela upwelling is characterised by a quasi-cycle of about 11–14 years.

"an investigation on the non-stationarity of flood frequency across the uk","2021","Water infrastructure design and flood mitigation projects are currently based on a so-called stationary assumption. However, this assumption has been challenged in recent years due to increased extreme weather, potentially leading to the underestimation of flood quantiles and an increased risk of structural failures. In the present study, peak flow series from 158 gauging stations in the UK are analysed using both stationary and non-stationary models based on the generalised additive models for location, scale and shape (GAMLSS) framework. Nine candidate covariates are used for non-stationary models to obtain information on the significant drivers of non-stationarity in each flood series. Very few stations are thus found to show temporal trends, which suggests that time-varying non-stationary flood models may not always be suitable, and the use of physically-based covariates can provide better-fitting models. In particular, the non-stationary models using rainfall-related covariates display the best performance for the vast majority of stations, thus suggesting that the variability of the rainfall regime remains the dominant driver for changes in flooding. Moreover, two atmospheric circulation patterns, namely the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the East Atlantic Pattern, were found to be closely related to the non-stationarity of flooding at a number of stations. Unlike rainfall, however, the influence of these climate indices is not particularly dominant; hence, they are more suitably employed as components of a multiple-covariate non-stationary model. Besides, a direct linkage between the variability of flooding and climate changes has not been identified either regionally or globally. For the majority of stations (70%), the use of multiple covariates can provide a better non-stationary model than the use of a single covariate.","Flood frequency analysis,Covariate,Non-stationarity,GAMLSS,UK,"
"energy-efficient transmission and computation resource optimization for uav-assisted noma-based maritime internet of things","2023","In Maritime Internet of things (MIoT) networks, buoys are widely deployed in offshore areas to collect and deal with the maritime data. However, buoys are struggling in handling computation-intensive maritime data due to the limited energy and computation resource. To address this issue, introducing the UAV with high computation resource as edge server to process the computation-intensive maritime data. In this paper, we deploy the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) assisted MIoT network, considering the limitation of maritime spectrum resource, Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) is used to simultaneously deliver the maritime data from multiple buoys to the UAV on the same frequency channel. We aim to minimize the total energy consumption by jointly optimizing the buoysâ€™ transmit power, the buoysâ€™ computation resources, the UAVâ€™s computation resource allocation, and the UAV trajectory. To address the NP-hard problem, we propose a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) based online algorithm to minimize the total energy consumption.

"intelligent task offloading for 6g-enabled maritime iot based on reinforcement learning","2021","With the continuous increase of maritime activities, maritime Internet of Things (M-IoT) devices are also growing explosively, which puts forward higher requirements for maritime networks with limited resources and complex environment. As the basis of 6G edge intelligence, edge computing technology can be adopted to deal with massive heterogeneous ocean data effectively to meet the needs of different maritime application scenarios. To improve the execution efficiency of maritime edge computing under the constraints of delay and energy consumption, we propose an edge computing network architecture for M-IoT based on the space-air-ground-sea integrated communication network of 6G, and put forward an intelligent task offloading algorithm based on Reinforcement Learning(RL), which migrates heavy computation tasks to suitable servers by means of cloud-edge-end cooperation.

"the 79 ce eruption of vesuvius: a lesson from the past and the need of a multidisciplinary approach for developments in volcanology","2022","A full review of the 79 CE Plinian eruption of Vesuvius is presented through a multidisciplinary approach, exploiting the integration of historical, stratigraphic, sedimentological, petrological, geophysical, paleoclimatic, and modelling studies dedicated to this famous and devastating natural event. All studies have critically been reviewed and integrated with original data, spanning from proximal to ultradistal findings of the 79 CE eruption products throughout the Mediterranean. The work not only combines different investigation approaches (stratigraphic, petrological, geophysical, modelling), but also follows temporally the 79 CE eruptive and depositional events, from the magma chamber to the most distal tephras. This has allowed us first to compile a full database of all findings of those deposits, then to relate the products (the deposits) to the genetic thermomechanical processes (the eruption), and lastly to better assess both the local and regional impacts of the 79 CE eruption in the environment. This information leads to a number of open issues (e.g., regional environmental impact vs. local pyroclastic current impact) that are worthy of further investigations, although the 79 CE eruption of Vesuvius is one of the best studied eruptions in volcanology. The structure of the work follows three macro-categories, the historical aspects, the products, and the processes of the 79 CE eruption. For each investigation approach (from stratigraphy to modelling), all dedicated studies and original data are discussed. The open issues are then synthesized in the discussion under a global view of Plinian eruptions, from the magma setting to its dispersion as pyroclasts flowing on the surface vs. falling from the volcanic plume. In this way, a lesson from the past, in particular from the well-studied 79 CE eruption of Vesuvius, will be of help for a better synchronization of processes and products in future developments. Lastly, various aspects for volcanic hazard assessment of Plinian eruptions are highlighted from the tephra distribution and modelling points of view, as these large natural phenomena can have a larger impact than previously thought, also at other active volcanoes.","Vesuvius,Pyroclastic currents,Pompeii,Plinian eruption,79 CE eruption,Multidisciplinary approach,Pyroclastic succession,79 CE tephra dispersal,"

"the global monitoring for environment and security (gmes) sentinel-3 mission","2012","Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) is the European programme to establish a European capacity for Earth Observation. GMES is designed to provide European policy makers and public authorities with accurate and timely information to better manage the environment, understand and mitigate the effects of climate change and ensure civil security. Sentinel-3 is an Earth observation satellite mission specifically designed for GMES to ensure the long-term collection and operational delivery of high-quality measurements to GMES ocean, land, and atmospheric services, while contributing to the GMES, emergency and security services. Key Sentinel-3 measurement requirements, corresponding to identified GMES user needs, have been derived as follows:•Sea surface topography (SSH), significant wave height (Hs) and surface wind speed derived over the global ocean to an equivalent accuracy and precision as that presently achieved by ENVISAT Radar Altimeter-2 (RA-2) but with enhanced surface topography measurements in the coastal zone, sea ice regions and over inland rivers, their tributaries and lakes.•Sea surface temperature (SST) determined for oceanic and coastal waters globally to an equivalent accuracy and precision as that presently achieved by the ENVISAT Advanced Along Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR) over the ocean (i.e. <0.3K), at a spatial resolution of 1km.•Visible, and Short-Wave Infrared radiances for oceanic, inland and coastal waters at a spatial resolution of 0.3km (simultaneously and co-registered with SST measurements), determined to an equivalent level of accuracy and precision as ENVISAT Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer with complete ocean coverage in 2–3days.•Visible and infrared radiances over global land-surfaces in 1–2days, sea-ice and ice-sheets equivalent to those currently provided from ENVISAT MERIS, AATSR and Système Probatoire d'Observation de la Terre (SPOT) Vegetation. The Sentinel-3 mission addresses these requirements by implementing and operating:•A dual frequency, Synthetic Aperture Radar Altimeter (SRAL) instrument supported by a dual frequency passive microwave radiometer (MWR) for wet-tropospheric correction, a Precise Orbit Determination package including a GPS receiver, a DORIS instrument and a laser retro-reflector.•A highly sensitive Ocean and Land Colour Imager (OLCI) delivering multi-channel wide-swath optical measurements for ocean and land surfaces.•A dual-view Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR) delivering accurate surface ocean, land, and ice temperature.•A collaborative ground segment providing management of the mission, management, development, production and access to core data products in an operational near real time delivery context. The mission foresees a series of satellites, each having 7-year lifetime, over a 20-year period starting with the launch of Sentinel-3A in late 2013 and of Sentinel-3B in late 2014. During full operations two identical satellites will be maintained in the same orbit with a phase delay of 180°.

"collaborative autonomous multi-vessel detection, bounding, and containment for maritime environmental disasters","2017","This paper demonstrates the process of adapting publicly available repositories for the MOOS-IvP middleware to efficiently create and solve problems for collaborative marine autonomy. The problem introduced in this paper addresses a collaborative approach for autonomous environmental anomaly detection, bounding, and containment. An environmental anomaly may be an oil spill, radioactive contamination, or other similar undesirable and detectable event. A simulated oil spill anomaly was introduced into the maritime environment. Multiple autonomous vessels searched an area and discovered the anomaly. Upon detection, one vessel continued to search the larger area for additional spills. The second vessel began a dedicated survey of the spill area to determine the severity, approximate bounding dimensions, and spreading, if any. Upon completing its survey to a reasonable level of confidence, another vessel confirmed the boundary then surrounded the bounded spill area with an oil boom to prevent further spreading. Vessels provided detailed spill reports throughout the survey and bounding process. A final spill report was sent to the shore side control station with the overall dimensions of the spill as well as the location and dimensions of the bounding oil boom that was laid. The vehicles used in this problem were capable of avoiding collision with other marine traffic in accordance with the international collision regulations (COLREGS).","international collision regulations,disasters,bounding process,Search problems,autonomous environmental anomaly detection,Oils,MOOS-IvP middleware,oil pollution,marine safety,bounded spill area,Linear programming,Databases,maritime environmental disasters,object detection,collaborative autonomous multivessel detection,collaborative marine autonomy,Collaboration,marine traffic,Autonomous vehicles,marine pollution,bounding oil boom,spill reports,multiple autonomous vessels,Temperature sensors,vessel,radioactive contamination,simulated oil spill anomaly,oceanographic techniques,"

"extreme mei-yu in 2020: characteristics, causes, predictability and perspectives","2023","The 2020 extreme rainfall was highly unusual with episodes of intensive rains and winds from the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River Valley to southern Japan. Given the severe implications and huge forecast spread among different models, the extreme Mei-yu has aroused widespread concern. This review synthesizes the latest research on the characteristics and potential climate forcing factors of such extreme Mei-yu and discusses the challenges and outlooks for prediction and numerical modeling. The distinct characteristics of the Yangtze River Valley summer rainfalls in 2020 included record-breaking accumulated precipitation, longest duration, earliest onset, and highest intensity. We summarize the majority of the studies investigating the diverse coupled ocean-atmospheric processes at different timescales. The research consensus is that the anomalous anticyclone spanning the western North Pacific and the mid-high latitude trough-ridge patterns are the two critical circulation features carrying tropical and mid-high latitude signals, jointly affecting the extreme Mei-yu. Potential mechanisms based on the two essential atmospheric circulations during the Mei-yu period are then highlighted. In addition, different climate model simulations are also introduced to reach an inter-model agreement despite certain model biases on the response of atmospheric circulations to these potential forcings among the state-of-the-art atmospheric and coupled general circulation models. This study provides a synthesis to promote the understanding, prediction, and disaster prevention of extreme Mei-yu.","East Asian upper-level westerly jet,Monsoon climate variation,Extreme Mei-yu precipitation,Western North Pacific subtropical high,Yangtze River Valley,"

"efficient neighbour discovery algorithm for maritime mesh networks with directional antennas","2008","The proliferation of wireless transceivers and the availability of unlicensed band has given a boost to the deployment of wireless networks, with the IEEE802.11/WiFi being the major driver in this arena. In this paper, we consider a wireless mesh network designed for long distance communication with a typical deployment scenario of a maritime mesh network. This network uses an antenna system made up of six fixed-beamwidth antennas. Directional antennas are used for both transmission and reception as compared to most other directional antenna schemes which use directional antenna for transmission and omni-directional antenna for reception. Through efficient use of directional antennas for both transmission and reception, and spatial reuse in transmission, we are able to realize a high capacity mesh network. We present practical methods and algorithms for the critical phase in the network operation, namely, neighbour discovery. We also show that our proposed scheme is deterministic and able to complete the task in finite time as compared to randomized and probabilistic schemes which have unpredictable execution times.","Neighbour Discovery,omnidirectional antenna,maritime mesh network,Wireless mesh networks,directive antennas,Land mobile radio cellular systems,Mesh networks,Directive antennas,Transmitting antennas,Wireless Maritime Mesh Networks,Directional antennas,Transceivers,Directional Antenna,telecommunication network topology,fixed-beamwidth antennas,Wireless application protocol,IEEE802.11-WiFi,neighbour discovery algorithm,spatial reuse,wireless transceiver,Receiving antennas,directional antenna,Spine,marine communication,frequency allocation,transceivers,wireless LAN,"
"smartsos: systems for maritime advanced rescue through satellite and optimized sensor networks","2016","After a shipwreck people wear life vest and the available telecommunication systems for rescue operations offer, in the best case, just approximate localization of relicts or lifeboats. A communication system tailored to provide a reliable and real time updated map of positions and health conditions of floating people can improve efficiency of rescue operation. The aim of the SMARTSOS system is to introduce the capability for each person, equipped with GPS receiver and health sensors, to send information at low cost to a remote location, maximizing delivery probability and quality of service, ensuring also data integrity. Each life vest will be equipped with a terminal able to exchange data only with other life vest terminals; a subset of all life vests (masters) will be equipped also with very small Low Earth Orbit (LEO) or GEO satellite terminal to provide long range connectivity; the space segment and the remote service center will complete the architecture. To maximize message delivery probability and to limit power we propose a joint exploitation of linear Network Coding and a store-and-forward mechanism. Each node overhears broadcast communications of neighbors, gathers messages and code them with its own message to rebroadcast the result with an uncoded copy of its message. On the other side, the rescue team will get the position grid and health information of shipwrecked people, planning operations accordingly.

"in-situ acoustic monitoring of direct energy deposition process with deep learning-assisted signal denoising","2022","In-situ monitoring is crucial for detecting process anomalies and ensuring part quality in additive manufacturing. Acoustic-based monitoring techniques offer extra benefits such as adjustable sensor setup and lower hardware costs. In the direct energy deposition (DED) process, acoustic signals generated by laser-material interactions carry information about underlying complex physical mechanisms such as melting, solidification, crack propagation, and pore formation. This paper presents a novel acoustic-based in-situ monitoring method for the DED process. The raw acoustic signal is made up of laser-material interaction sound as well as noise from machine movement, inert gas flow, and powder flow. A deep learning model is developed to build an end-to-end signal denoising framework to minimize environmental noise and extract the laser-material interaction sound. Audio equalization, bandpass filtering, and Harmonic-Percussive Source Separation algorithm are used to produce a cleaned laser-material interaction sound as the model's ground truth target. Acoustic data is collected from experiments using different DED machines, materials, and varied process parameters to train the deep learning model. The proposed deep learning-assisted signal denoising strategy lays the groundwork for acoustic-based in-situ defect detection of the DED process.","Acoustic Signal Processing,Additive Manufacturing,Direct Energy Deposition,Sound Source Separation,In-situ Monitoring,Deep Learning,"

"redundant localization system for automatic vehicles","2020","Unmanned vehicles rely on positioning information for a number of key operations. The location systems for vehicles require having the most information available when it comes to positioning for security and redundancy purposes. Assisted-Global Navigation Satellite System is the most popular positioning system, however, jointly to that, other positioning systems should be integrated into the Electronics and Electric System of the vehicle for reliability purposes, and a selection criterion for choosing the proper information should be also implemented. In this paper, we propose different Electrical Control Units for providing localization information by using different technologies in 5G networks and provide an algorithm for selection of information. These Units complement the Global Navigation Satellite System. Moreover, we provide a method to calculate the Dilution Of Precision for the integrated localization techniques, which are the Observed Time Difference of Arrival and beamforming. Finally, the simulation results of the vehicle localization of both methods in 5G show that fusion system (using more than one positioning system) not only provides redundancy, but also overcomes the efficiency of separated techniques. The simulations also validate the mathematical description of the dilution of precision described in the paper.","Unmanned vehicle,Localization,Dilution of precision,Electronic control unit,Beamforming,OTDoA,"
"evaluation of fast-acquisition gps in stationary tests and fine-scale tracking of green turtles","2009","Fastloc GPS (FGPS) is a variant of Global Positioning System (GPS) technology that offers important new utility for investigating fine-scale movements of marine animals like green turtles that surface too briefly for effective use of standard GPS. I report here on the accuracy and efficiency of this novel technology, compare it with two alternative methods, namely boat-based ultrasonic tracking and Argos Platform Transmitter Terminals (PTTs), and provide new data on the vagility and habitat selection of green turtles in shallow coastal foraging habitat. I used a combined FGPS receiver and PTT transmitter (Sirtrack, Havelock North, New Zealand) mounted together with an ultrasonic transmitter and time-depth recorder in a tether-attached housing that allowed automatic detachment and subsequent retrieval of the equipment without the requirement to recapture turtles. With this equipment I conducted short deployments (4.5 to 16.8 d) on 3 free-living adult-size green turtles in coastal foraging habitat in Queensland, Australia. In addition, stationary tests in air and afloat were conducted at the same site. FGPS location error (mean±SD) increased as the number of satellites used in each computation decreased, from 26 m±19.2 (8 satellites) to 172 m±317.5 (4 satellites). During live tracking the frequency of FGPS locations greatly exceeded Argos PTT, such that screened data comprised about 50 times more FGPS locations despite a much tighter screening threshold for FGPS (250 m) than for Argos PTT (1000 m). FGPS locations showed the three study turtles used modest short-term activity ranges with Minimum Convex Polygon area mean±SD 662 ha±293.9. They all remained within <4.7 km of their capture–release locations and favoured shallow water, with 86% of locations at charted depths ≤3 m and the deepest location at 5.9 m. Fine-scale movements of each turtle varied from day to day with respect to tortuosity and areas traversed. Statistically significant day–night differences were evident in average rates of movement (greater by day) and in habitat selection, where diurnal locations had greater seagrass density while nocturnal locations featured deeper bathymetry. Individual turtles revisited some of their centres of activity (identified from 50% fixed kernel utilisation distributions) on multiple occasions but none of the study turtles travelled consistently between the same day–night pair of sites as has been reported elsewhere. Such disparity and the day-to-day variation in movements revealed by these short-term findings highlight the need for detailed tracking over longer periods at multiple locations. Fastloc GPS technology proved an effective new tool for this area of research.","Vagility,Activity range,Linear error,Accuracy,Acoustic tracking,Fastloc GPS,Argos PTT,"
"observation and propagation of wave groups to improve the proceedings of the maritime operation","2019","One way to increase the operability of the naval platform is to predict its future motions. To predict these future motions it is necessary to know the future environmental conditions and more especially the waves incoming to the naval platform. To know the incoming waves it is necessary to observe them upstream with an optical or electromagnetic sensor and propagate them down to the future position of the naval platform. This knowledge of the future waves can be decisive for engaging critical phase of maritime operations, like the launch and recovery of helicopters and dronesâ€¦Among the observed waves, some of them called 'dangerous waves' can induce high ship motions which carry on a cancellation of the launch or land of a helicopter. Dangerous is not about tsunami or rogue waves here, but rather relatively energetic waves (higher, steeper than average) that can transfer kinetic energy to the ship. Often these waves occur in groups. The aim of this article is to present a simple and pragmatic method based on an energetic approach to find these 'dangerous waves' out of the observed surface by the waves sensors and propagate them up to a desired position. Results of the propagation of the identified 'dangerous waves' are presented for simulated surface elevation of open ocean, obtained by using the software HOS-ocean.

"maritime moving target detection technique for passive bistatic radar with gnss transmitters","2017","The paper puts forward a moving target detection technique for passive bistatic radar systems based on GNSS signals for maritime surveillance applications. If from one hand navigation satellites are extremely attractive as opportunistic sources for passive radar due to their global coverage and the availability of multiple satellites, on the other hand they provide a restricted power budget. To strengthen the target energy sufficiently to allow its detection, observation time has to be increased up to several tens of seconds. This requires the need to develop innovative techniques able to deal with such long integration times. In this paper, a local plane-based maritime moving target detection (M-MTD) technique is proposed. Such a technique performs the integration of the received signal for a long integration time, properly taking into account the migration of the moving target during the entire dwell time. Moreover, it provides target detection in the local plane that represents the section of maritime area covered by the radar antenna. Since this plane is common to multiple transmitters, the proposed technique can be easily extended to the multistatic case, which is the bigger benefit in using GNSS sources. Simulated and experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed M-MTD technique to detect ship targets, not detectable with conventional MTD techniques, with the GNSS-based passive radar.","Satellites,marine radar,Radar antennas,radar detection,passive radar,M-MTD technique,radar antennas,marine navigation,Transmitters,received signal integration,satellite navigation,target energy,local plane-based maritime moving target detection technique,ship target detection,radar antenna,search radar,Doppler effect,restricted power budget,maritime surveillance applications,Passive radar,Object detection,spaceborne radar,passive bistatic radar system,GNSS transmitters,"
"filter-bank approach within tightly-coupled navigation system for integrity enhancement in maritime applications","2021","Navigation systems, estimating the vehicle states with high accuracy, robustness and integrity, are crucial for guidance system in autonomous applications. This publication presents a filter-bank approach designed for a tightly-coupled navigation system, aiming at improving the integrity of the navigation system and the accuracy of the estimated navigation solution under sensor failures. In particular, this navigation system is based on an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and is aided by pseudorange and deltarange-observation of satellite systems, and 3D velocity measurements from a Doppler velocity log (DVL). The designed filter-bank approach proposes a new structure, which handles the challenge of different update rates and measurement delays of the involved sensors. Under IMU failures, the estimated states from the filter bank are reversed to estimate the vehicle acceleration, which improves the IMU bias and state estimation performance at next epochs. The designed approach is validated in a real-time test campaign with an unmanned surface vehicle (USV) in the harbor of Rostock, Germany. During the real-time test, several forms of simulative faults are added to the DVL measurements to evaluate the designed approach. Meanwhile, all necessary sensor data is recorded for further evaluation in post-processing environment. The experimental results show that the designed approach is capable of identifying the simulated sensor failures. Compared with conventional tightly-coupled extended Kalman filter (EKF), the designed approach improves the average horizontal positioning accuracy and its standard deviation under simulative DVL failures by 167% and 771%, respectively.","Satellites,Kalman filters,state estimation performance,guidance system,Safety,channel bank filters,satellite systems,estimated navigation solution,Delays,marine navigation,inertial navigation,Global Positioning System,designed filter-bank approach,Filter banks,integrity enhancement,inertial measurement unit,Three-dimensional displays,state estimation,3D velocity measurements,nonlinear filters,sensors,Real-time systems,vehicle states,Robustness,tightly-coupled navigation system,filter bank,velocity measurement,simulated sensor failures,designed approach,"
"holocene interaction of maritime and continental climate in central europe: new speleothem evidence from central germany","2019","Central European climate is strongly influenced by North Atlantic (Westerlies) and Siberian High circulation patterns, which govern precipitation and temperature dynamics and induce heterogeneous climatic conditions, with distinct boundaries between climate zones. These climate boundaries are not stationary and shift geographically, depending on long-term atmospheric conditions. So far, little is known about past shifts of these climate boundaries and the local to regional environmental response prior to the instrumental era. High resolution multi-proxy data (stable oxygen and carbon isotope ratios, S/Ca and Sr/Ca) from two Holocene stalagmites from Bleßberg Cave (Thuringia) are used here to differentiate local and pan-regional environmental and climatic conditions Central Germany through the Holocene. Carbon isotope and S/Ca and Sr/Ca ratios inform us on local Holocene environmental changes in and around the cave, while δ18O (when combined with independent records) serves as proxy for (pan-)regional atmospheric conditions. The stable carbon isotope record suggests repeated changes in vegetation density (open vs. dense forest), and increasing forest cover in the late Holocene. Concurrently, decreasing S/Ca values indicate more effective sulfur retention in better developed soils, with a stabilization in the mid-Holocene. This goes in hand with changes in effective summer infiltration, reflected in the Sr/Ca profile. Highest Sr/Ca values between 4 ka and 1 ka BP indicate intensified prior calcite precipitation resulting from reduced effective moisture supply. The region of Bleßberg Cave is sensitive to shifts of the boundary between maritime (Cfb) and continental (Dfb) climate and ideally suited to reconstruct past meridional shifts of this divide. We combined the Bleßberg Cave δ18O time series with δ18O data from Bunker Cave (western Germany) and a North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) record from lake SS1220 (SW Greenland) to reconstruct the mean position of the Cfb-Dfb climate boundary. We further estimate the dynamic interplay of the North Atlantic Oscillation and the Siberian High and their influence on Central European climate. Repeated shifts of the Cfb-Dfb boundary over the last 4000 years might explain previously observed discrepancies between proxy records from Europe. Detailed correlation analyses reveal multi-centennial scale alternations of maritime and continental climate and, concurrently, waning and waxing influences of Siberian High and NAO on Central Europe.","S/Ca,Speleothem,Climate boundary,Sr/Ca,Oxygen isotopes,Palaeoclimate,Germany,Continental climate,Carbon isotopes,Holocene,Maritime climate,"

PBDE congeners (n=15) were measured in 13 sediments and nine mussel samples, taken from Hong Kong marine waters. The ∑15PBDEs in sediments ranged between 1.7 and 53.6ngg−1 dry wt, with the highest concentrations located around the most heavily populated areas of Victoria Harbour and Sai Kung, while the lowest concentrations of ∑15PBDEs were found at more remote locations of Sha Tau Kok, Wong Chuk Bay, Castle Peak Bay, and Gold Coast. ∑15PBDEs ranged from 27.0 to 83.7ngg−1 dry wt of mussel tissues. Although not identical, most of the congeners in sediments were found in mussel tissues, with BDE-47, BDE-99, BDE-153 and BDE-183 being the most prominent in both matrices. On the basis of a literature survey, the concentrations of PBDEs reported in Hong Kong sediments and mussel tissues are amongst the highest in the world.","Mussels,Sediments,Hong Kong,Polybrominated diphenyl ethers,PBDEs,"

"fuzzy-based acquisition in gps receivers for spoofing mitigation","2023","Spoofing attacks are one of the most dangerous threats in the application of the Global Positioning System (GPS). These attacks can influence different parts of GPS receivers such as acquisition, tracking, or navigation part. We focus on the acquisition stage. We propose a fuzzy-acquisition technique that aligns the value of the acquisition threshold by using the parameters affecting the acquisition performance in the presence of the spoofing attack. Then, the ratio between the correlation levels of different satellite signals is introduced as a new criterion for distinguishing the spoofing signal from the authentic signal. In order to verify the proposed algorithm, it is implemented in a measurement and four laboratory data sets. The results indicate that the proposed algorithm effectively mitigates spoofing attacks by an average of 96.61%. Lastly, the performance of the suggested method is compared against the wavelet-based method. The results show a 21.60% advantage of our method.","Spoofing attack,Acquisition threshold,Fuzzy Logic,GPS,"

The locations covered in this paper are RÃ¸st (67.5Â°N), VadsÃ¸ (70.1Â°N) and Isfjord Radio (78.1Â°N). The elevation angles towards the satellite are 14, 10 and 3 degrees, respectively. Excess attenuation and precipitation are studied and compared with prediction models from ITU-R. The measured rain intensities at 0.01 per cent of time are 5.8 mm/h for Isfjord Radio, 13.8 mm/h for VadsÃ¸ and 16.5 mm for RÃ¸st. For the three stations, the predicted rain intensities from ITU-R, at the same time percentage, are significantly higher, while the values from the Norwegian mainland rain intensity map are relatively close to the measured ones. Rain height based on measured ground temperatures are lower than those utilised in the ITU-R model for VadsÃ¸ and Isfjord Radio. The significance of cloud attenuation is clearly visible when investigating the same two sites, which both have long paths through the atmosphere. The measured excess attenuation at 0.01 per cent of time is 18.2 dB for Isfjord Radio, 14.0 dB for VadsÃ¸ and 8.6 dB for RÃ¸st.

"a methodology to improve the assessment of vulnerability on the maritime supply chain of energy","2015","The globalization of trade is due to the transportation possibilities and the standardization (containerization of freight). The dependency of the economy to the sea and to the merchant navy has increase this last decade. This process forms a worldwide maritime network between the different locations of production and consumption.

Rodrigue demonstrates[1] the economic dependency of energy is increasing in the industrialized countries (North America, Europe, East Asia). The inter-regional trade of oil was 31 million bbl/day in 2002 and is expected to grow up to 57 bbl/day in 2030 [2]. Most of the international traffic use a maritime way, where may occur disruptions. For example, the Suez crisis (1956-1957) caused a closure of the canal, reducing the throughput capacity of transportation. This disruption cost a 2 millions of barrels lost per day.

"detecting and quantifying palaeoseasonality in stalagmites using geochemical and modelling approaches","2021","Stalagmites are an extraordinarily powerful resource for the reconstruction of climatological palaeoseasonality. Here, we provide a review of different types of seasonality preserved by stalagmites and methods for extracting this information. A new drip classification scheme is introduced, which facilitates the identification of stalagmites fed by seasonally responsive drips and which highlights the wide variability in drip types feeding stalagmites. This hydrological variability, combined with seasonality in Earth atmospheric processes, meteoric precipitation, biological processes within the soil, and cave atmosphere composition means that every stalagmite retains a different and distinct (but correct) record of environmental conditions. Replication of a record is extremely useful but should not be expected unless comparing stalagmites affected by the same processes in the same proportion. A short overview of common microanalytical techniques is presented, and suggested best practice discussed. In addition to geochemical methods, a new modelling technique for extracting meteoric precipitation and temperature palaeoseasonality from stalagmite δ18O data is discussed and tested with both synthetic and real-world datasets. Finally, world maps of temperature, meteoric precipitation amount, and meteoric precipitation oxygen isotope ratio seasonality are presented and discussed, with an aim of helping to identify regions most sensitive to shifts in seasonality.",""
"spatial-modulated physical-layer network coding based on block markov superposition transmission for maritime relay communications","2020","As an alternative to satellite communications, multi-hop relay networks can be deployed for maritime long-distance communications. Distinct from terrestrial environment, marine radio signals are affected by many factors, e.g., weather conditions, evaporation ducting, and ship rocking caused by waves.

Meanwhile, the physical-layer network coding (PNC) scheme with spatial modulation (SM) is adopted to improve the spectrum utilization. For the BMST-SM-PNC system, we propose an iterative algorithm, which utilizes the channel observations and the a priori information from BMST decoder, to compute the soft information corresponding to the XORed bits constructed by the relay node. The results indicate that the proposed scheme outperforms the convolutional coded SM-PNC over fast-fading Rician channels.

"primary drivers of dune cover and shoreline dynamics: a conceptual model based on the iberian atlantic coast","2023","Coastal dunes evolve in direct response to primary drivers, such as wind and waves, which can significantly influence the landscape. Here, we examine the effects of the wind and wave regimes on the vegetation cover and shoreline position of the dune system that makes up the Doniños barrier on the rocky NW Iberian coast since the middle of the 20th century. By studying a series of aerial images, we determined that the vegetated dunes experienced net seaward shoreline advance at an average rate of 1.28 ± 0.01 m/year and an overall dune vegetation coverage expansion of 50.5 %. Available local atmospheric data indicated that wind stilling was the main factor responsible for these trends. However, the shoreline evolution process included annual-to-decadal periods dominated by stalled or reversed advances in energetic winters when waves could reach the foredune, causing erosion and vegetation cover deterioration. Consecutive energetic winters resulted in severe foredune erosion and slow to no recovery of shoreline advance thereafter. This work presents a case study in which a new conceptual model of the opposite and unbalanced effects of wind stilling and storm surges on foredune evolution dynamics is discussed and established under the current climate change scenario.","Coastal dune evolution,Shoreline change,Storminess,Wind stilling,Ground-penetrating radar,Sea level rise,"

"multi-agent distributed cooperative routing for maritime emergency communication","2023","With the development of intelligent shipping industry, massive terminal device is connected to maritime network, which causes the centralized scheduling mechanism fails to meet the communication requirements of large-scale network. Mean-while, constant location changes of vessels make it difficult to acquire the optimal route planning with existing routing schemes. Therefore, enlightened by the success of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), we propose a multi-agent distributed cooperative routing algorithm driven by maritime emergency communication task. The algorithm utilizes the calculation results of adjacent agents to train local model, which can alleviate the coupling between individual agent and global data. For large network with small-scale topological changes, we leverage online learning mechanism for local training to ensure the accuracy of routing decision. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed routing algorithm could not only avoid congestion, but substantially reduce retraining time, overhead communication cost and high compute consumption brought by small-scale topological dynamic changes.

"trends in physical, optical and chemical columnar aerosol characteristics and radiative effects over south and east asia: satellite and ground-based observations","2022","Recent satellite observations of atmospheric aerosol loading over Asia indicate a dipole pattern in the aerosol optical depth (AOD) with a substantial decrease in AOD over East Asia and persistent increase in AOD over South Asia, the two global hotspots of aerosol emissions. Aerosol emissions over Asia are also changing rapidly. However, the evolution of physical, optical and chemical columnar aerosol characteristics, and their radiative effects over time, and the resultant impacts of such evolving trends on climate and other associated risks are not yet properly quantified, and used in climate impact assessments. In order to do so, we closely examine, in addition to satellite observations, for the first time, high-quality, ca. two-decade long ground-based observations since 2001 of aerosols and their radiative effects from several locations in the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) in South Asia and the North China Plain (NCP) in East Asia. A clear divergence in the trends in AODs is evident between the IGP and the NCP. The single scattering albedo (SSA) is increasing, and the absorption AOD due to carbonaceous aerosols (AAODCA) is decreasing over both regions, confirming that aerosols are becoming more scattering in nature. The trends in observed aerosol content (AOD) and composition (SSA) are statistically significant over Kanpur in the IGP and Beijing in the NCP, two locations with longest ground-based records. The aerosol radiative forcing of atmosphere (ARFATM) and resultant atmospheric heating rate (HR) are decreasing over both regions. However, current regionally coherent and high annual HR of 0.5–1.0 K day−1 has severe implications to climate, hydrological cycle, and cryosphere over Asia and beyond. These results based on high-quality observations over a large spatial domain are of great significance and are crucial for modelling and quantifying aerosol-climate interactions.","Aerosol trends,Physical,Asia,Radiative effects,Atmospheric aerosols,Optical and chemical characteristics,Climate change,"

"aerosol characteristics and types in the marine environments surrounding the east mediterranean - middle east (emme) region during the aqaba campaign","2023","This study analyzes the aerosol optical properties (scattering, absorption coefficients, single scattering albedo), supported by chemical composition measurements, in the marine boundary layer of the East Mediterranean – Middle East (EMME) region, aiming to explore the spatio-temporal variability, aerosol mixing state, sources and dominant types. The measurements were taken during the AQABA (Air Quality and climate change in the Arabian Basin) cruise campaign (1st July – September 1, 2017) from the south of France to Kuwait and back. Both scattering and absorption coefficients for PM1 and PM10 particles maximized in the southern Red Sea, due to continental outflow from East Africa, and in the Arabian/Persian Gulf due to enhanced anthropogenic/industrial emissions, leading to 3-fold sulfate concentrations compared to the other regions. The East Mediterranean exhibited moderate aerosol loading, with high scattering Ångström Exponent (SAE) values (1.98, 1.30 for PM1 and PM10, respectively), which increased in the Suez Canal and the Arabian Gulf due to impact from combustion sources. The aerosol over the Gulf of Aden and the West Arabian Sea was dominated by coarse particles (SAE<1), with higher Ca2+ concentrations (dust influence). The absorption Ångström Exponent (AAE) remained close to 1, indicative of black carbon (BC) from fossil fuel combustion, while it increased in regions dominated by dust (Gulf of Aden, Arabian Sea). Contrasting aerosol types were identified between the sub-regions using the SAE vs. AAE classification scheme. The “BC-dominated” type prevailed over the East Mediterranean and Suez Canal, while dust mixtures dominated in the Gulf of Aden and the Arabian Sea. Over the Arabian Gulf, mixing of anthropogenic pollution with marine aerosols formed a type with fine particles and low spectral dependence of absorption (AAE<1). Spectral SSA significantly varied along the ship cruise, while it was used for determination of dust influence in the marine environment.","Marine boundary layer,Mediterranean,Aerosol scattering,Absorption,Aerosol types,Middle East,"

"the southeast asian tin belt","1995","The Southeast Asian Tin Belt is a north-south elongate zone 2800 km long and 400 km wide, extending from Burma (Myanmar) and Thailand to Peninsular Malaysia and the Indonesian Tin Islands. Altogether 9.6 million tonnes of tin, equivalent to 54% of the world's tin production is derived from this region. Most of the granitoids in the region can be grouped geographically into elongate provinces or belts, based on petrographic and geochronological features. - The Main Range Granitoid Province in western Peninsular Malaysia, southern Peninsular Thailand and central Thailand is almost entirely made up of biotite granite (184–230 Ma). Tin deposits associated with these granites contributed 55% of the historic tin production of Southeast Asia. - The Northern Granitoid Province in northern Thailand (0.1% of tin production) also has dominant biotite granite (200–269 Ma) but it is distinguished by abundant post-intrusion deformation. - The Eastern Granitoid Province extends from eastern Peninsular Malaysia to eastern Thailand. The Malaysian part is subdivided into the East Coast Belt (220–263 Ma), Boundary Range Belt (197–257 Ma) and Central Belt (79–219 Ma). The granitoids cover a wide compositional range from biotite granite to hornblende-biotite granite/granodiorite and diorite-gabbro. Tin deposits are associated with biotite granite in the East Coast Belt (3% of tin production). The granitoids in the other areas of the Eastern Granitoid Province are barren. - The Western Granitoid Province (22–149 Ma) in northern Peninsular Thailand, western Thailand and Burma has biotite granite and hornblende-biotite granite/granodiorite. Tin deposits are associated with biotite granite, which probably is the dominant phase (14% of tin production). The granitoids of the Indonesian Tin Islands (193–251 Ma) do not permit grouping into geographically distinct units. Main Range-type and Eastern Province-type plutons occur next to each other. Most of the tin deposits are associated with Main Range-type plutons (28% of tin production). Tin-mineralized plutons are characterized by high concentrations of SiO2, K2O, Rb, Sn, Th and U, whereas the concentrations of Fe2O3, MgO, CaO, Na2O, Ba and Sr as well as the Fe2O3FeO ratios are low.

"global change and the measurement of absolute sea-level","1987","To quantify properly the long-term response of sea-level to climate change, land motions must be separated from the apparent or relative sea-level change recorded by conventional tide/sea-level gauges. Here we present a concept for global measurement of the true or “absolute” sea-level change, which combines recent advances in space-based geodetic techniques with plans for a global sea-level network under the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP). Data from initial feasibility tests show that land motion, due to global (plate tectonic), regional (glacial rebound), or local (fluid withdrawal) effects, can probably be measured to ±1cm (on a single measurement basis) by an innovative combination of Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) and Global Positioning System (GPS) tevhniques. By making repeated observations of position at a number of tide gauges using portable, economical GPS receivers in a differential mode relative to the fewer, more stable, but more expensive VLBI observatories, it will be possible to subtract land motion from the relative sea-level signal. Decadal to century scale trends at the 1–2mm y−1 level will be resolvable in the sea-level and vertical land motion time series within about a decade. Detection of subsidence or uplift at specific gauges will allow correction for land motion or deletion of bad data when computing regional or global, i.e. eustatic, sea-level changes. In addition to their applications in oceanography and climate studies, such data will test models by Peltier and other that relate mantle viscosity and deglaciation history to present rates of crustal subsidence or uplift. If the predicted crustal motions are confirmed, we can also have more confidence in the use of historical tide/sea-level gauge records in retrospective studies of sea-level change related to climate variability on decadal or longer time scales. It is concluded that as few as one-third (about 100) of the total number of tide/sea-level gauges (250–300) required for global climate research programmes (WYRTKI and PUGH, 1984) need to be upgraded to “sea-level observatory” status, in terms of sensors and geodetic control, to build a two tier sea-level network that will provide the data needed to solve many problems of both relative and absolute sea-level change. Such a network will provide basic information supporting research on a wide range of questions related to “global change”.",""
"maritime vessel route extraction and automatic information system (ais) spoofing detection","2021","Automated Identification System (AIS) comprises of a global real-time network of maritime vessels, transmitters, and satellite or ground-station receivers, which are used to track and record time-stamped static (vessel-id, type, etc.) and dynamic (location, course, speed, etc.) information of all maritime vessels. Traditionally, this data feed has been used by vessel traffic services to avoid vessel collisions, however increasingly, marine researchers and data scientists have shown interest in developing algorithms on historical AIS data-dumps with diverse objectives such as estimating trends in global ocean-currents, maritime logistical planning, fishing fleet monitoring and enhancing maritime security. This paper aims to propose a novel shipping-route extraction algorithm to process historical AIS data (running into tens of gigabytes of daily data, from more than a hundred thousand maritime vessels), to effectively characterize global shipping route behaviour and capture its seasonal trends. This is done by formulating a sigmoid based turning waypoint identification, which does not solely depend on the change in the course of a vessel, derived from AIS message. The AIS data is further processed to excerpt the vesselâ€™s distance from the nearest port and nearest shore with resolution of about 1 km, which forms a handy metric for the identification of suspicious ports. Several other use cases are also explored, which include detecting various anomalies in individual vessel behaviour such as intentional or unintentional switching off AIS transmission, shipping-lane deviations, spoofing transmission messages. To tackle spoofing anomaly, various spoofing identification methods are discussed. A region-based spoofing identification algorithm is developed to identify spoofing points under multiple categories using a clustering algorithm. All the results are visualized through an open-source map overlay.

"distribution, sources and consequences of nutrients, persistent organic pollutants, metals and microplastics in south american estuaries","2019","Estuarine pollution imposes rapid, increasing and lasting environmental modifications. In the present review, especial attention is given to estuaries in South America (SA), where legislation, policies and actions to guarantee environmental quality remain ineffective. There, the majority of estuaries face uncontrolled occupation of its margins by urban and industrial centres, agriculture and aquaculture expansion, water extraction and flow control. The lack of basic sanitation and poor environmental management (including territories within Marine Protected Areas) often lead to hydrological alterations, high nutrient loads, and the presence and dynamics of pollutants (nutrient loads, persistent organic pollutants (POPs), metals and plastic debris) along the entire estuarine ecocline. Organic enrichment has increased dissolved oxygen consumption, with wide spatio-temporal variability along latitudes and estuarine gradients. The toxicity, biogeochemistry and availability of metals and POPs depend on the annual fluctuations of salinity, water renewal, dissolved oxygen levels, suspended particulate loads, sediment mobility, grain size and composition at the sink. Plastic debris from land sources are widespread in estuaries, where they continue to fragment into microplastics. River basins are the main contributors of plastics to estuaries, whose transportation and accumulation are subjected to interannual water flow variations. Although some systems seems to be in a better condition in relation to others around the world (e.g. Goiana and Negro estuaries), many others are among the most modified worldwide (e.g. Guanabara Bay and Estero Salado System). We propose that, estuarine conservation plans should consider year-round fluctuations of the ecocline and the resulting cycles of retention and flush of environmental signals and their influence on trophic webs over the whole extent of estuarine gradients.","estuarine conservation,microplastic,persistent pollutants,Environmental pollution,metals,estuarine processes,bioaccumulation,"
"an analysis of maritime communications between a ship at sea and a shore station by a ray-based monte carlo method","2017","In this paper, an analysis of maritime communications between a ship at sea and a shore station using a ray-based Monte Carlo method has been proposed. A sea surface is modeled by the one-side Pierson-Moskowitz spectrum. A Monte Carlo method based on a ray tracing is employed to predict the scattering from the temporally evolving rough sea surface for each time step. The maximum of double reflections is restricted in the ray tracing for a practical purpose. The total received signal is the superposition of the direct propagating field and the scattered field by the sea surface. The statistical numerical result is finally obtained by averaging the results from many realizations.

"abrupt holocene climate change and potential response to solar forcing in western canada","2011","Several abrupt climate events during the Holocene, including the widely documented oscillation at 8.2 thousand years before present (ka), are attributed to changes in the North Atlantic thermohaline circulation. Additional mechanisms, such as interactions between atmospheric circulation, ice-sheet dynamics, and the influence of solar irradiance, also have been proposed to explain abrupt climatic events, but evidence remains elusive. This study presents evidence from multi-proxy analyses on the Holocene sediments of Eleanor Lake, interior British Columbia. Climatic inferences from our decadal-resolution record of biogenic silica (BSi) abundance are supported by changes in diatom and pollen assemblages from the same core and correlations with existing regional climate records. The BSi record reveals abrupt and persistent climatic shifts at 10.2, 9.3, and 8.5ka, the latter two of which are coeval with major collapses of the Laurentide Ice Sheet. The record also reveals a short-term cooling at 8.2ka that is distinct from the 8.5ka event and similar in magnitude to several other late-Holocene coolings. BSi is correlated with solar-irradiance indices (r=0.43–0.61), but the correlation is opposite in sign to that expected from direct solar forcing and weakens after 8ka. Possible mechanisms causing the abrupt and persistent climate changes of the early Holocene include 1) sudden losses of ice and proglacial lake extent, causing a shift in the meridional structure of atmospheric circulation, 2) a possible link between solar minima and El Niño-like conditions that are correlated with warm spring temperature in interior British Columbia, and 3) the influence of solar irradiance variability on the position of the polar jet, possibly via effects on the strength of the glacial anticyclone.","Atmospheric circulation,British Columbia,Solar forcing,Diatoms,Abrupt climate change,Biogenic silica,"
"automatic geo-registration of maritime video feeds","2008","We propose an automatic method to geo-register maritime video feeds to satellite images. The method first detects horizon during the day time and apex during the night time for similarity rectification. It then finds water pixels on both satellite images and camera views. Finally, geo-registration is obtained by searching the best orientation where the water masks are matched. The current state-art-of-state video surveillance system benefits with this method by providing situational awareness on maps with physical data including object size, location, and velocity in the world coordinates. Experimental results and applications such as cross camera tracking are demonstrated.","Satellites,Feeds,Pixel,similarity rectification,automatic geo-registration,Cameras,Principal component analysis,maritime video feeds,Application software,Optical reflection,water pixels,Target tracking,satellite images,Video surveillance,video signal processing,image registration,Boats,state-art-of-state video surveillance system,video surveillance,"
"energy harvesting space-air-sea integrated networks for mec-enabled maritime internet of things","2022","In recent years, various maritime applications such as unmanned surface vehicles, marine environment monitoring, target tracking, and emergency response have developed rapidly in maritime communication networks (MCNs), and these applications are often accompanied by complex computation tasks and low latency requirements. However, due to the limited resources of the vessels, it is critical to design an efficient mobile edge computing (MEC) enabled network for maritime computation. Inspired by this motivation, energy harvesting space-air-sea integrated networks (EH-SASINs) for maritime computation tasks offloading are proposed in this paper. We first make the optimal deployment of tethered aerostats (TAs) with the K-means method. In addition, we study the issue of computation task offloading for vessels, focusing on minimizing the process delay of computation task based on the proposed architecture. Finally, because of the NP-hard properties of the optimization problem, we solve it in two stages and propose an improved water-filling algorithm based on queuing theory. Simulation results show that the proposed EH-SASINs and algorithms outperform the existing scenarios and can reduce about 50% of the latency compared with local computation.","Satellites,efficient mobile edge computing,computation offloading,MEC-enabled maritime Internet,remotely operated vehicles,Delays,computation task,EH-SASINs,local computation,target tracking,Space vehicles,energy harvesting space-air-sea integrated networks,marine safety,Servers,cellular radio,complex computation tasks,optimisation,mobile computing,Low earth orbit satellites,Computer architecture,MEC,maritime applications,maritime computation tasks,unmanned surface vehicles,marine environment monitoring,marine communication,maritime communication networks,Task analysis,energy harvesting,resource allocation,MCNs,"
"a 100-year extreme snow-avalanche record based on tree-ring research in upper bødalen, inner nordfjord, western norway","2014","This paper analyses with the help of tree-ring studies the recurrence of extreme snow avalanches in a path situated in the upper Bødalen valley and originating from an outlet glacier of the Jostedalsbreen ice cap. By analysing tree-ring patterns of 91 trees, four extreme snow-avalanche events, extending over the entire valley floor and up to a distance of 800m from the foot of the slope, are clearly highlighted during the 20th century and at the beginning of the 21st century. Return periods of 15 to 20years for the most extreme events are extracted from the analyses, and recurrence intervals of 10 to 15years for avalanches presenting distinct deposition lobes uphill of the distal torrent. Results obtained by tree-ring analyses are successfully compared with available documents at different spatial and temporal scales. Rock-face snow-avalanche occurrences in the area, of small to medium size, are associated with heavy wintry precipitation combined with strong winds. However this normal situation is not valid for extreme snow avalanches crossing the path investigated in the paper, which result from the outlet glacier located in the starting zone; this glacier commands spatial and inter-annual variations of snow accumulation in the departure zone.","Outlet glacier source-area,Extreme snow avalanches,Western Norway,Wintry weather conditions,Tree-ring record,Upper Bødalen valley,"
"first comparison of sentinel-1 and terrasar-x data in the framework of maritime targets detection: south italy case","2016","The Sentinel-1A is the first of two satellites that composes the Sentinel-1 radar mission. Both satellites operate a C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) system to give continuity to the European SAR program. SAR is a flexible sensor able to fulfil users/applications requirements in terms of resolution and coverage thanks to different operational modes and polarizations. With the in-orbit availability of very-high-resolution X-band SAR sensors, the Sentinel-1 satellites have been designed to achieve wide coverage at medium to high resolution. The interferometric wide swath (IWS) mode implemented with the terrain observation with progressive scan (TOPS) technique is the standard acquisition mode over European waters and land masses. IWS in dual-polarization (VV/VH) combination offers 250-km swath at 5 m Ã— 20 m (range Ã— azimuth) spatial resolution. These specifications are in line with the needs of the European Maritime and Security Agency (EMSA) for oil spill and ship detection applications included in the CleanSeaNet program. The main goals of this paper are: assessment of medium-to-high-resolution C-band Sentinel-1 data with very-high-resolution X-band TerraSAR-X data for maritime targets detection; synergetic use of multiplatforms satellite SAR data for target features extraction; evaluation of polarimetric target detectors for the available co-polarization and cross-polarization Sentinel-1A IWS VV/VH products. The objectives are achieved by means of real, almost coincident C-band and X-band SAR data acquired by Sentinel-1A and TerraSAR-X satellites over Gulf of Naples and Catania (South Italy). Furthermore, the obtained results are supported by recorded ground truth vessel reports via terrestrial automatic identification system (AIS) stations located in the area.","CleanSeaNet program,Satellites,multipolarization,marine radar,maritime target detection,terrain observation with progressive scan technique,radar detection,Multifrequency,terrestrial automatic identification system stations,Marine vehicles,target feature extraction,European Maritime and Security Agency,EMSA,very-high-resolution X-band SAR sensors,Synthetic aperture radar,Sentinel-1 radar mission,object detection,synthetic aperture radar,feature extraction,IWS,Europe,polarimetric target detectors,Radar tracking,radar imaging,interferometric wide swath,Radar remote sensing,targets detection,European SAR program,TOPS technique,radar resolution,Object detection,spaceborne radar,Surveillance,in-orbit availability,C-band synthetic aperture radar system,South Italy case,TerraSAR-X data,synthetic aperture radar (SAR),"

"mercury concentration and isotopic composition on different atmospheric particles (pm10 and pm2.5) in the subtropical coastal suburb of xiamen bay, southern china","2021","The concentration and isotopic composition of particulate-bound mercury (PBM) on both PM2.5 and PM10 were simultaneously measured (24 months) in a typical subtropical coastal suburb of Xiamen bay (SCXB), southern China. The results showed that most mercury was concentrated in PM2.5 and small particulates enriched heavier isotopes of mercury more than lighter ones. Negative Δ199Hg values and slightly positive Δ200Hg values were observed in both PM2.5 and PM10. PBM input sources were identified with isotopic compositions and meteorological data using the NOAA HYSPLIT model. It revealed that biomass combustion is the main source of particulate mercury in SCXB, and the two other sources are urban anthropogenic emissions and potential marine sources. Seasonal variations in isotopic composition and correlation analysis suggested that PBM in SCXB mainly originate from inland after long-distance transportation in spring and under the influence of oceanic air masses in summer. The Δ199Hg/Δ201Hg ratios in all samples (1.01 ± 0.05, 2SE) indicated that the photoreduction of Hg(II) in the aerosol was the main reaction process of PBM transformation in the atmosphere. Seasonal variations in Δ200Hg values were also found, indicating the possibility of even mass independent fractionation in tracing the mercury sources.","Inhalable particle,Fine particle,Mercury source,Photoreduction,Mercury isotopes,"
"realistic extended target model for track before detect in maritime surveillance","2015","Traditional target tracking algorithms are generally fed a set of thresholded detections under the hypothesis that no more than one detection is generated by each single target. Improvements in modern radar systems have made possible to obtain high resolution data of the targets, making them occupy more than a single resolution cell, and have made necessary to use appropriate Extended Target Tracking (ETT) techniques, since the aforementioned hypothesis is no longer valid. However, these techniques do not often take into account the physical phenomena that are involved in the radar-sea-target system. This paper explores some of the effects involved in the transmission, propagation, backscattering and processing of the radar signal in a maritime environment, that have a crucial importance in ETT. A statistical model that considers the featured effects is developed and tested in a particle filter based Track before Detect (TbD) algorithm. Accounting for physical aspects, good outcomes in both kinematic (i.e. position and velocity) and size (i.e. width and length) estimation can be pointed out using real radar data acquired by a high resolution X-band Marine radar located in the Gulf of La Spezia, Italy.","maritime surveillance environment,marine radar,radar-sea-target system,Radar antennas,radar detection,statistical model,data acquisition,Italy,Antenna radiation patterns,TbD algorithm,statistical analysis,target tracking,Target tracking,particle filtering (numerical methods),Gulf of La Spezia,radar signal backscattering,search radar,Radar tracking,radar signal propagation,Convolution,radar signal processing,high resolution X-band marine radar,radar tracking,track before detect algorithm,radar signal transmission,Clutter,radar resolution,extended target tracking technique,particle filter,data target resolution,backscatter,ETT technique,oceanographic techniques,"

Analysis from the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) on board Europe's Sentinel-5P and Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS), for the first wave of COVID-19 in 2020, have shown a substantial improvement in air quality. More specifically, since lockdown until the end of April, Lisbon and Porto were at their lowest PM10 levels in 2 years, while Madrid had a significant drop with values considerably below 2018 levels but still close to 2019 values. In terms of NO2 levels, Lisbon had an historical minimum of the last 2 years during most of April 2020 and Madrid had 2-year lowest level since lockdown.

In this paper, by using laser ablation- inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) and other analytical methods, body and glaze of samples from Zhejiang Longquan celadon and its imitation in Dapu kiln of Guangdong in the Ming Dynasty of China were determined. Our research reveals that (1) the celadon bodies from the Dapu kiln contain less Al2O3, Mo, V, Cr and Ni, and more SiO2 content than those of the Longquan kiln; (2) the celadon glazes from both the Longquan and Dapu kilns show higher content of CaO, Al2O3, Ba, Sr, P2O5 and MnO than the corresponding bodies; and (3) both the celadon bodies and glazes from the Dapu kiln have higher ΣREE and in particular significantly negative Ce anomalies, distinctly different from those from Longquan kiln. These results would not only provide a good basis to identify the Longquan celadon and its imitation, and even to protract the global trade route in ancient time, but also be beneficial to better understanding the recovery and transmission of Longquan celadon manufacturing technology.","The imitation of Longquan celadon,LA-ICP-MS,Trace elements,Longquan celadon,"

Besides the feasibility of the snippet backscatter data, it was focused on the attainable horizontal accuracy in comparison to side-scan sonar and autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) surveys. The data was collected in shallow coastal waters of up to 18 m water depth (Baltic Sea) close to an ammunition dumping site characterized by an almost flat seafloor covered with sand and silt sediments.

"extreme weather and climate events in northern areas: a review","2020","The greatest impacts of climate change on ecosystems, wildlife and humans often arise from extreme events rather than changes in climatic means. Northern high latitudes, including the Arctic, experience a variety of climate-related extreme events, yet there has been little attempt to synthesize information on extreme events in this region. This review surveys work on various types of extreme events in northern high latitudes, addressing (1) the evidence for variations and changes based on analyses of recent historical data and (2) projected changes based primarily on studies utilizing global climate models. The survey of extreme weather and climate events includes temperature, precipitation, snow, freezing rain, atmospheric blocking, cyclones, and wind. The survey also includes cryospheric and biophysical impacts: sea ice rapid loss events, Greenland Ice Sheet melt, floods, drought, wildfire, coastal erosion, terrestrial ecosystems, and marine ecosystems. Temperature and sea ice rank at the high end of the spectra of evidence for change and confidence in future change, while drought, flooding and cyclones rank at the lower end. Research priorities identified on the basis of this review include greater use of high-resolution models and observing system enhancements that target extreme events. There is also a need for further work on attribution, impacts on ecosystems and humans, and thresholds or tipping points that may be triggered by extreme events in high latitudes.","Climate,Northern regions,Extremes,Weather,Storms,"
"remote sensing of bush fire dynamics in central africa from 1984 to 1988: analysis in relation to regional vegetation and pluviometric patterns","1995","Spatial and temporal subcontinental patterns of fire distribution in Africa, may vary strongly from year to year. These variations may be of climatic or anthropic origin. Global Area Coverage (GAC) data, from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), are known both to provide a good description of fire calendar and on a continental scale, a good indicator of locations of intense fire activity. In fact, the GAC data, available on a daily basis back to July 1981, is the only source of information actually available to determine burning patterns both on a continental scale and over long periods of time. This study presents the spatio-temporal distribution of vegetation fire in Central Africa, as derived from GAC imagery, over the four 1984/85 to 1987/88 dry seasons of the Northern Hemisphere (November to February periods). The analysis of the mean fire distribution patterns over the four dry seasons, as defined by vegetation cover and pluviometric conditions, shows a north to south gradient of fire activity in the savannah domain: This gradient of fire activity has been previously related to the annual pluviometric calendar and the amount of rainfall. The strong interannual variability in fire activity observed for this four-years-period could not, however, be explained by the monthly pluviometric patterns. The observed fire gradient therefore seems to result from additional meteorological or anthropic parameters. The methodology used in this study demonstrates the potential of GAC data for fire monitoring at a subcontinental scale. Current work is extending the area of interest to the entire African continent using the 10-yr-period of GAC imagery.",""
"holocene hydrological changes in europe and the role of the north atlantic ocean circulation from a speleothem perspective","2021","Societal concerns about future hydroclimate changes urge a thorough understanding of the governing processes. Here, an analysis of Middle and Late Holocene speleothem-based hydroclimate reconstructions and paleoclimate model simulations reveals sub-millennial fluctuations in the spatiotemporal variability of precipitation in the European and Mediterranean regions, that complements previous dendrochronological and pollen-based reconstructions with an improved temporal resolution. Although insolation forcing is the primary driver of Holocene hydroclimate changes in Europe on a multimillennial scale, the evaluation of the principal component analysis of speleothem records and correlations with sea surface temperature data indicates that North Atlantic ocean circulation played a significant role in the sub-millennial variation of continental moisture transport, with an increasing importance during the Late Holocene. The combined evaluation of speleothem-based data, climate simulations and sea surface temperature records therefore advances our understanding of the governing processes of Holocene hydroclimate changes in the European and Mediterranean regions.","European and mediterranean regions,Principal component analysis,Holocene hydroclimate,Speleothems,Ocean circulations,Stable isotope compositions,"
"vessel detection and classification: an integrated maritime surveillance system in the tyrrhenian sea","2010","In recent years a number of organizations, both national and international, have put significant efforts in developing knowledge-based integrated maritime surveillance (IMS) systems. The final aim is to have a clear picture of the position, classification, identification and movement of cooperative and non-cooperative targets entering and leaving the 200 nautical miles limit of the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). Each sensor (i.e. satellite-based, ground-based, shipborne or airborne) has its own task and, in such a context, high frequency (HF) surface wave (SW) radars are inexpensive tools for long range early warning applications in open waters. They allow maximizing the effectiveness in dealing with fisheries protection, drug interdiction, illegal immigration, terrorist threats, search and rescue tasks. This paper focuses on the possibility of combining automatic identification system (AIS) data with HFSWR data for vessel detection and classification purposes. Three algorithms for target detection in compound Gaussian HF sea clutter are presented and their performance evaluated. The combined use of AIS plots provided by cooperative targets can allow the operator to discriminate non-cooperative targets and possible threats.

"rare earth elements and yttrium as tracers of waste/rock-groundwater interactions","2022","Increasing concentrations of Rare Earth Elements (REE) plus yttrium (REY) are entering the environment due to human activities. The similar chemical behaviour across the whole REY, i.e. the lanthanide series (lanthanum to lutetium) and yttrium, allows their use as tracers, fingerprinting rock-forming processes and fluid-rock interactions in earth science systems. However, their use in fingerprinting waste and particularly low-level radioactive waste has not received much attention, despite the direct use of REE in the nuclear industry and the traditional use of REE as proxies to understand the environmental mobility of the actinide series (actinium to lawrencium). The highly instrumented low-level radioactive waste site at Little Forest (Australia) allows a detailed REY study, investigating interactions with local strata, neighbouring waste forms and shallow groundwater flows. Groundwater samples and solids from cored materials were recovered from 2007 to 2012 from the study site and regional baseline sites in the same geological materials. The REY in water samples were analysed by automated chelation pre-concentration (SeaFast, ESI) followed by ICP-MS determination, while solid samples were analysed using Neutron Activation Analysis (NAA) and X-ray fluorescence scanning (ITRAX). Solid rocks showed no REY departed from typical Upper Crust compositions in either Little Forest or regional background sites. Shallow groundwater from ~4–5 m, at or slightly below waste trench levels, showed water-waste interaction as a marked enrichment, relative to shale-normalised patterns, in samarium, europium and gadolinium, with depleted yttrium. Leachate samples from the neighbouring urban landfill show different REY normalised patterns. REY distribution changes with depth through increased interaction with shales and sandstones. Variations in pH and redox conditions lead to widespread precipitation of Fe-hydroxides, which scavenge REY with differential uptake by precipitating solids, resulting in increases in Y and higher Y/Ho ratio in the groundwater along the flow path. Our study revealed that the Little Forest low-level radioactive waste has a REY fingerprint different to that of groundwater in surrounding land uses. REY can be used to fingerprint diverse waste sources, assess the mobility of lanthanides inferring the mobility of selected actinides, and to trace the fate of REY during groundwater recharge. The approach presented can refine source allocation and trace pollutant mobility in current and legacy urban, mixed and radioactive waste sites around the world.","Waste-rock interaction,Rare earth elements and yttrium (REY),Low-level nuclear waste,Landfill,Tritium,Little Forest Legacy Site,"
"peridotite xenoliths in alkali basalts from the sikhote-alin, southeastern siberia, russia: trace-element signatures of mantle beneath a convergent continental margin","1995","Abundant spinel peridotite xenoliths occur in late Cenozoic alkali basaltic rocks in the Sikhote-Alin region at the Pacific margin of the Asian continent. Major- and trace-element compositions of representative peridotite xenolith are documented for four occurrences located in different structural units of the continental margin. In each locality, the majority of xenoliths have distinctive microstructures, modal and chemical compositions that are typical for a given xenolith suite. Significant textural and compositional differences between the four xenolith suites suggest that the upper mantle beneath the Sikhote-Alin consists of distinct domains with contrasting composition. The inferred large-scale mantle heterogeneities may be due to juxtaposition of lithospheric blocks of different provenance during accretion of the Sikhote-Alin to the Asian continent. Trace-element patterns of the xenoliths and their minerals obtained ICP-MS technique provide evidence of depletion and enrichment events and indicate contrasting behaviour of REE, HFSE and other incompatible trace elements. The HFSE behave non-concordantly, in particular, some xenoliths have highly fractionated Zr/Hf, Ti/Zr, Nb/Ta, La/Nb and U/Th ratios relative to their values in the primitive mantle. The fractionated compositions may be related to the interaction of evolved subduction-related fluids and melts with lithospheric mantle at the Mesozoic-early Cenozoic active continental margin or to metasomatism during later continental rifting.",""

At the kinematic level, desired linear velocities and yaw rate are prescribed by incorporating a line-of-sight guidance scheme to achieve position-heading stabilization. At the kinetic level, an anti-disturbance kinetic control law is designed based on an extended state observer. Through converting the input constraints to velocity constraints on guidance signals, the safety-guidance signals are obtained by solving a quadratic programming problem subject to the state, input, and collision-avoidance constraints. It is proven that an MASS controlled by using the proposed method is input-to-state safe in the presence of ocean disturbances. Simulation results are elaborated to substantiate the efficacy of the proposed safety-certified control law for the automatic berthing of an MASS subject to physical constraints and environmental disturbances.","Kinematics,control system synthesis,required complicated maneuvering,Safety,maritime autonomous surface ships,Marine vehicles,marine navigation,constrained water space,constrained water region,safety-certified control law,Safety-certified control,ships,marine safety,anti-disturbance kinetic control law,line-of-sight guidance scheme,MASSs subject,input-to-state safety,safety-guidance signals,safety-certified constrained control,position control,challenging operation,input-to-state safe,Sea surface,input constraints,environmental disturbances,Kinetic theory,safety-critical constrained anti-disturbance control method,collision-avoidance constraints,quadratic programming,desired linear velocities,Training,observers,stationary and moving obstacles,unmanned surface vehicles,safety-aware automatic berthing,Uncertainty,mobile robots,kinetic level,velocity constraints,collision avoidance,ocean disturbances,physical constraints,automatic berthing,"
"the calibration of a california measurements pc-2 quartz crystal cascade impactor (qcm)","1992","The California Measurements 10-stage Quartz Crystal cascade impactor (QCM) has been widely used for near real-time monitoring of the aerodynamic particle size distribution of aerosols in the size range from 0.05 to 25 μm aerodynamic diameter. Calibration data for this impactor are limited, especially at particle sizes smaller than 0.5 μm aerodynamic diameter. A QCM impactor has therefore been calibrated with monodisperse aerosols throughout its operating range, particular attention being paid to internal deposition. This study has also highlighted that electrostatic charge equilibration of aerosols entering the QCM impactor is essential if reliable data are to be obtained. The collection stages are electrically insulated from their supports so that the mass of particles collected can be sensed; this requirement renders it possible for electrostatic charge to build up on the surface of the sensing crystals, interfering with the subsequent collection of further charged particles.",""
"cosmogenic 7be and 22na in finland: production, observed periodicities and the connection to climatic phenomena","2012","This study presents theoretical production calculations and time series analyses of two cosmogenic isotopes, 7Be and 22Na, from the four high-latitude stations of Kotka, Kajaani, Rovaniemi and Ivalo located in Finland. We used published results for 7Be but performed full simulations of the 22Na production in atmosphere. For the first time, lookup tables of 22Na production by cosmic rays in the atmosphere are presented. In conjunction with calculations using the new model of 22Na production, the 7Be/22Na ratios in the atmosphere were also calculated. The wavelet transform of the 7Be and 22Na time series revealed sets of periodicities in the 2.5–8 year range. The wavelet coherence method was used to study coherences between 7Be and 22Na and 7Be/22Na data and AO, NAO, AMO, QBO and SO teleconnection indices representing different climatic variations in Northern Europe. In the wavelet coherence analyses, the 7Be activities were found to be mainly modulated by NAO and AMO at an interannual scale, while 22Na activity was found to be less effected by climatic phenomena. The 7Be coherence with other indices was intermittent where the coherence with SO was limited to Ivalo data and in the case of QBO, to Kotka data. The 22Na data was not found to be in coherence with any of the studied indices. In the 7Be/22Na ratio a clear seasonal pattern was observed where low 7Be/22Na ratios were observed during summer and high ratios during winter. This was speculated to be caused by the height of atmospheric vertical mixing. During 2006–2011, the 7Be/22Na ratios from Kotka, Kajaani and Rovaniemi showed variance at synoptic time scales but were nearly identical at the seasonal scale. The 7Be/22Na ratio was proposed to be a radiochronometer to estimate residence times of aerosols carrying 7Be and 22Na.","Na,Finland,Cosmic rays,Be,Teleconnections,Atmosphere,"
"ag600 maritime base location decision based on the interval intuitionistic fuzzy topsis method","2022","Aiming at the location research blank of the AG600 amphibious aircraft marine rescue base, the location decision index system of the AG600 is established, and the AG600 location decision model based on the interval intuitionistic fuzzy theory and improved TOPSIS method is constructed. Through investigation and statistical analysis, the evaluation system with 10 indices is determined based on applicability, safety, and accessibility, and in the process of quantization of index assignment, a fuzzy conversion method for different indices is proposed. The interval intuitionistic fuzzy number of each index is obtained by combining objective calculation and subjective assignment, and the interval intuitionistic fuzzy decision matrix is constructed. The fuzzy entropy method is used to calculate the index weight, and then the improved Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity (TOPSIS) is used to evaluate and rank the rescue bases, the scientific and reasonable location decision results are obtained. Moreover, STOPSIS and WS are used to analyze and demonstrate the sorting inversion problem, and the value is 0.908, which further proves the effectiveness of the method proposed in this paper.

"method for rapid localization of seafloor petroleum contamination using concurrent mass spectrometry and acoustic positioning","2009","Locating areas of seafloor contamination caused by heavy oil spills is challenging, in large part because of observational limitations in aquatic subsurface environments. Accepted methods for surveying and locating sunken oil are generally slow, labor intensive and spatially imprecise. This paper describes a method to locate seafloor contamination caused by heavy oil fractions using in situ mass spectrometry and concurrent acoustic navigation. We present results of laboratory sensitivity tests and proof-of-concept evaluations conducted at the US Coast Guard OHMSETT national oil spill response test facility. Preliminary results from a robotic seafloor contamination survey conducted in deep water using the mass spectrometer and a geo-referenced acoustic navigation system are also described. Results indicate that this technological approach can accurately localize seafloor oil contamination in real-time at spatial resolutions better than a decimeter.","Oil spill,Environmental survey,Petroleum,Mass spectrometry,Contamination,Heavy oil,"
"has egnos its own place in maritime navigation?","2015","GNSS (in fact it usually means GPS) is at the moment the fundamental means of positioning for any variants of navigation. However some attributes of it can be not sufficient for every users or in some tasks, so there are many cases when this system needs support. From the mariner point of view pure GPS properties perfectly fulfils expectations of sailors at the open sea, however there are lot of cases, when accuracy of the system are not sufficient. Besides of accuracy other performance characteristics, for example availability, risk of jamming etc. are important. As the â€œmedicineâ€ for this, differential version of GPS is suggested. At the moment hundreds of DGPS reference stations exist all over the world, but simultaneously other augmentation systems provide services for example European overlay for GPS (European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service - EGNOS). But over 30 years of DGPS use at sea causes that sailors prefer it than EGNOS.At the moment as EGNOS is fully operational, it is time for evaluation of pro and cons of both services in the maritime context. As it was mentioned, at the open waters there is no doubt about GPS usability and in fact DGPS as well as EGNOS are not necessary. In real situation this is anyway impossible because of limited coverage of DGPS. It is truth that EGNOS is accessible on all the seas around Europe, however seamen do not see so far need of such high accuracy of the fixing. However on restricted waters, on approaches to harbours and on river navigation both systems seem to be indispensable, especially because their accuracy. On the other hand observation made with AIS over accuracy of ships' position on Gdanska Bay suggest that problem is not clear. In these waters two DGPS reference stations are available aside from EGNOS. Observation of AIS messages shows, that on the some leg of the route some ships' positioning data are changeover on DGPS when other one DGPS is switched on GPS, and other one does not change accuracy at all. From the other side positions fixed with DGPS at different locations but at a similar distance from Reference Station have noticeable different accuracy. The location of these places suggests the influence of the signal propagation over land on the fixes accuracy. In the paper analysis of different aspects of both systems work are presented as well as their usefulness and limitations are analysed. Finally the advantage of EGNOS over DGPS in marine navigation and field of application of both systems is discussed.","Satellites,Maritime Navigation,Global Navigation Satellite system,GNSS,European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service,Europe,AIS messages,Receivers,jamming,maritime navigation,European overlay,augmentation systems,Satellite broadcasting,DGPS reference stations,EGNOS,marine navigation,Global Positioning System,"
"real-time maritime situation awareness based on deep learning with dynamic anchors","2018","Situation awareness in maritime environment entails early detection and classification of maritime targets of varying sizes, depths, shapes, textures, and contrasts. Thus, this paper describes a novel deep learning based maritime situation awareness approach using high-definition video. Maritime object detection is achieved in three main steps. At first, a key region based tracking algorithm allows to, dynamically and parsimoniously, extract high-quality region proposals mainly focalized around rigid (i.e.; potential object) video locations. The latter are, further, fed into a Fast-RCNN for carrying out objectness detection and box regression. Finally, a mere box post-regression operation enables to extract maritime objects. Furthermore, the found object detections are fed into a second classification RCNN, specifically, trained to recognize up to 40 vessel classes. Our experiments have shown that the proposed approach achieves state of the art speed and accuracy.","real-time maritime situation awareness,object detections,objectness detection,maritime situation awareness approach,high-definition video,key region based tracking algorithm,maritime objects,Streaming media,maritime object detection,regression analysis,Object recognition,neural nets,target tracking,deep learning,object tracking,marine engineering,Proposals,object detection,maritime targets,box post-regression operation,classification RCNN,video signal processing,maritime environment,Deep learning,Object detection,high-quality region proposals,Surveillance,Task analysis,learning (artificial intelligence),dynamic anchors,"

"aligning value creation and sme competitiveness in the export of maritime services: empirical evidence from trinidad and tobago","2023","The multifaceted composition and preponderance of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) participating in the services sector create unique challenges for specialization, productivity, and innovation, particularly in the export of maritime services. Three issues distilled from the literature are (i) servitization of SMEs, (ii) diversification during periods of uncertainty, and (iii) value creation cluster initiatives as a stimulus for enhancing SME competitiveness, in a circular economy. Aligning value creation and SME competitiveness could drive maritime services export. This paper examines whether SME service-providers could improve competitiveness through value creation and cluster initiatives in the export of maritime services in Trinidad and Tobago (T&T). A survey was conducted in the Leisure Marine Services Cluster. Acquired data on five value creation determinants (namely, repair accuracy, concurrent engineering, quality standard, quality assurance, and quality control) were analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS). Empirical evidence shows that repair accuracy and quality standard had positive estimates, with reliability coefficients above 0.70. The application of cluster initiatives would support the development of a value creation program and enhance SMEâ€™s competitiveness in T&T.","Maintenance engineering,Quality control,Boats,Uncertainty,Sociology,Surveys,Technological innovation,"

"the paleoposition of india","1986","In most of the plate tectonic models of paleocontinental assembly, the supercontinent Pangea has been disassociated into independent Laurasia and Gondwana, separated by a vast oceanic Tethys. The position of India remains problematical, but geological and geophysical data support a Pangea reconstruction. Traditionally India has always been regarded as a part of Gondwana as it shares two unique geologic features with other southern continents. These are the Upper Paleozoic glacial strata and the Glossopteris flora. However, neither line of evidence definitely proves continuity of land; together they indicate zonation of cold climates. The recent discovery of Upper Paleozoic glacial strata in the U.S.S.R., southern Tibet, Saudi Arabia, Oman, China, Malaya, Thailand, and Burma demonstrates that the Permo-Carboniferous glaciation was far more extensive beyond the Gondwana limit than is usually thought. Similarly the Glossopteris flora has been found farther north of the Indian Peninsula, in the Himalaya, Kashmir and Tibet. Moreover the floral similarities are explained easily by wind and insect dispersal. On the other hand, the distribution of large terrestrial tetrapods is strongly influenced by the distribution of continents. To terrestrial tetrapods, sea constitutes a barrier. In consequence, they are more reliable indicators of past land connections than are plants, invertebrates and fishes. The postulated separation of India from Antarctica, its northward journey, and its subsequent union with Asia, as suggested by the plate tectonic models, require that during some part of the Mesozoic or Early Tertiary India must have been an island continent. The lack of endemism in the Indian terrestrial tetrapods during this period is clearly inconsistent with the island continent hypothesis. On the contrary, Indian Mesozoic and Tertiary vertebrates show closest similarities to those of Laurasia, indicating that India was never far from Asia. The correlation of faunal similarity is extremly poor between India-Antarctica and India-Australia. This suggests that India cannot be placed alongside Antarctica or Australia in a pre-drift assembly. Moreover, the distribution of marine rocks indicates that India faced an open sea at its eastern margin during Proterozoic, Upper Paleozoic and Mesozoic. Before the drift, India probably occupied the position between Somalia and Asia, and the Tethys was narrow and intracontinental. With the spreading of the Carlsberg Ridge in the Upper Cretaceous, the Indian block rotated counter-clockwise in relation to Africa to converge to Asia, with the opening up of the Arabian Sea. The rotational movement of India is supported by hot spot trajectory and reversal of paleoslopes of the ancient Gondwana rivers. There is a possible genetic relation between the Arabian sphenochasm and the origin of the Himalaya. With continued convergence of India to Asia, limited subduction occured at the Indus Suture along the axis of the Tethys; the further compression led to the closure of the Tethys followed by foldings, faultings and large-scale intracratonic subductions to form the Himalaya. The Himalayan uplift probably began in the Miocene, but went more actively in the Quaternary.",""
"a stochastic ray-tracing approach for maritime line-of-sight channel modeling","2019","In this paper, we propose a modeling approach for maritime wireless channels based on a stochastic ray-tracing approach. Taking into consideration the line-of-sight (LOS) path, the specular reflection path, and the diffuse reflection paths from the sea surface, the maritime wireless fading channel is modeled by combining all the propagation paths arrived at the receiver point. In contrast to the conventional ray-tracing approaches where the propagation environments (and hence, the rays) are considered to be fixed, our stochastic ray-tracing approach assumes varying propagation environment caused by practical factors such as the sea wave. In this case, the locations of the reflection and receiver points randomly vary following a stochastic process. Based on the proposed channel model, we further investigate the deep fading effect in maritime wireless propagations caused by destructive combination of sparse rays. We show by simulations that the role of sea wave has two sides. Specifically, the sea wave is beneficial to compensate the deep fading in the areas where the LOS path and the specular reflection path have been destructively combined, while on the other hand it might induce more outage in the areas where deep fading has not occurred.","ray tracing,receiver points,ray-tracing,sparse rays,maritime wireless channel,Rough surfaces,Stochastic processes,channel model,maritime wireless channels,propagation paths,maritime line-of-sight channel,outage,line-of-sight path,stochastic processes,radiowave propagation,Reflection,diffuse reflection paths,specular reflection path,Sea surface,line-of-sight,Fading channels,LOS path,fading channel,sea wave,Surface roughness,marine communication,Channel model,propagation environment,conventional ray-tracing approaches,stochastic ray-tracing approach,Ray tracing,fading channels,"
"a big data approach for fuel oil consumption estimation in the maritime industry","2022","Route optimization has been a research topic for many years in the maritime industry and it constitutes one of the key components to improving energy efficiency and sustainability in ship operations. This paper deals with the challenge of estimating Fuel Oil Consumption (FOC) in the context of Weather Routing (WR). Given a plethora of features collected from the vesselâ€™s Automatic Identification System (AIS) or on-board sensor installations, we examine how a predictive FOC scheme can be coupled with WR optimization algorithms in order to reduce the vesselâ€™s FOC, emissions, and the overall cost of a voyage. In order to handle the amount of data required for FOC prediction, we employ a streaming pipeline that harvests data in real-time from different sources and processes them appropriately for visualization, causal analysis, and forecasting purposes. In this direction, we first conduct an exploratory analysis to examine and unveil the importance and inter-association between the various variables related to sea-keeping and weather features, in order to utilize them effectively in the context of a FOC predictive scheme. Furthermore, we introduce a novel recurrent neural network architecture that approximates ideally the underlying function describing the features and the vesselâ€™s FOC by taking into account historical data, and we showcase the results. Finally, we demonstrate how the FOC prediction model can be coupled with a WR algorithm to propose the optimal route for a vessel in terms of FOC efficiency.","big data collection,recurrent neural nets,sustainability,recurrent neural network architecture,sea-keeping weather features,Prediction algorithms,fuel oil consumption,WR optimization,Recurrent neural networks,Industries,recurrent neural networks,causal analysis,ship operations,information processing,weather routing,exploratory analysis,vessel data,fuel oil consumption estimation,Oils,ships,automatic identification system,energy efficiency,AIS,optimal route,optimisation,sea-keeping,fuel economy,Big Data,petroleum,on-board sensor installations,Routing,energy consumption,shipbuilding industry,energy conservation,route optimization,maritime industry,weather routing optimization,vessel,production engineering computing,Fuels,FOC prediction,"
"maritime targets velocity estimation in space-based passive multistatic radar using long integration times","2021","Target detection by means of space-based passive radar sensors generally requires the adoption of long integration time strategies to reinforce sufficiently the signal strength. These are usually based on the recovery of the target Doppler-rate to cope with the range and Doppler migration experienced over the long dwell considered. In this work, we put forward a Taylor-series approach that capitalizes on the set of bistatic Doppler-rates estimated in Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS)-based multistatic radar configurations to estimate the velocity of ship targets with increased accuracy with respect to conventional Doppler-based procedures. Both the cases of single-element and array receiver configurations have been considered. Theoretical and numerical results under different use cases show as leveraging on the long integration times adopted at the detection stage could significantly increase the accuracy of the estimated ship velocity components. Few experimental results are also provided, verifying the potentialities of the proposed approach in operative scenarios of practical interest for this technology. The proposed approach is not limited at the GNSS case, but it could be potentially applied to any multistatic passive radar system.","Satellites,estimated ship velocity components,Taylor-series approach,space-based passive radar sensors,Radar antennas,target detection,passive radar,Marine vehicles,signal strength,ship velocity estimation,detection stage,long integration time strategies,maritime targets velocity estimation,multistatic passive radar system,satellite navigation,single-element,GNSS-based radar,maritime surveillance,Global Navigation Satellite Systems-based multistatic radar configurations,object detection,ship targets,array receiver configurations,long integration times,space-based passive multistatic radar,target Doppler-rate,bistatic Doppler-rates,GNSS case,radar receivers,Radar,radar tracking,multistatic radar,Doppler radar,Passive radar,conventional Doppler-based procedures,Spaceborne radar,Estimation,Doppler migration,"

"sampling errors in satellite-derived infrared sea-surface temperatures. part i: global and regional modis fields","2016","Long time series of accurate Sea Surface Temperatures (SSTs) are needed to resolve subtle signals that may be indicative of a changing climate. Motivated by the stringent requirements on SST accuracy required for Climate Data Records (CDR) we quantify sampling errors in satellite SSTs. Infrared sensors, including the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), have sampling errors caused by incomplete coverage primarily due to clouds and inter-swath gaps (gaps between successive swaths/orbits). Unlike retrieval errors, the sampling errors are introduced when calculating mean values and in generating gap-free SST fields. We generate MODIS-sampled SST fields by superimposing MODIS cloud masks on top of the Multi-scale Ultrahigh Resolution (MUR) SST field for the same day. Based on the MODIS-sampled fields, we calculate sampling errors at different temporal and spatial resolutions to examine the impacts at different scales. Our results indicate that sampling errors are significant, more so in the high latitudes, especially the Arctic. The 30°N–30°S zonal band is found to have the smallest errors; a notable exception is the persistent negative errors found in the Tropical Instability Wave area, where the mesoscale ocean–atmosphere interaction leads to a more frequently satellite sampling above the cold sections of the wave area. The global mean sampling error is generally positive and increases approximately exponentially with missing data fraction at a fixed averaging interval, while error variability is mainly controlled by SST variability. Areas with persistent cloud cover have large sampling errors in temporally averaged SSTs. We conclude that the sampling error can be an important or even dominant component of the error budget of mean and gap-free SST fields. Climate data generation and interpretation of satellite-derived SST CDRs and their application must be conducted with due regard to the sampling error.","Sea Surface Temperature (SST),Climate Data Records (CDR),MODIS,Sampling errors,"
"twelve years of geophysical research in the charlevoix seismic zone","1988","Various and extensive geophysical monitoring began in 1974 in the Charlevoix Seismic Zone (CSZ). The historical record and a major earthquake in 1925 characterize this zone as the likely site of a future damaging earthquake (i.e. M = 5.5 or larger) and the aim of the monitoring was to develop the capability of predicting such earthquakes. The parameters studied included: microseismicity, seismic travel times, electrical impedance, vertical movement, horizontal movement, tilt, gravity change, and strain through water well level changes. Although no clear precursor was detected in the months before the largest seismic event that occurred during the observation period (M = 5.0), the multiparameter experiment provided new insights into the structure and the mechanics of this active region. Observations of several hundred well-located microearthquakes have permitted the delineation of ancient rift faults that are now being activated by high horizontal compression. The geographical extent of the zone is sharply defined by the microseismicity which occurs in an area of 35 km × 80 km straddling the St. Lawrence River. Observation of P-waves from accurately-timed explosions and S-waves from earthquakes support the hypothesis of Extensive Dilatancy Anisotropy (EDA) involving saturated parallel cracks in the crust. The data have permitted an estimate of both crack density and the direction for the principal compressive stress in the region (N 30° E). Changes in electrical parameters with periods of months to years were detected at five of the six magnetotelluric stations installed in the region. Changes in the polarization angle of the earth's electrical (telluric) field correlated well (for seven years) with calculated groundwater accumulation levels at one site. Electric impedance changes showed no clear correlation from station to station, but changes at one station appear to correlate with a seismic P-wave travel time change anomaly and with the disappearance of a negative gravity anomaly at the time of an unusual number of earthquakes in the range M = 2 to 3 from mid 1976 to mid 1977. It is suggested that these correlated changes could be related to aseismic stress redistribution and fluid flow along one of the NE striking rift faults about two years before theM = 5.0 earthquake in 1979. Continuous monitoring of tilt (surface and borehole) and well-water levels was carried out at a single site (Charlevoix Geophysical Observatory). Although there were unexplained near-surface tilts of the order of the earth tide amplitude within two or three days before some earthquakes, they were either not spatially coherent or were related to small unexplained temperature changes in the tiltmeter vault. No intermediate-term (one week to one year) precursors were seen against a noise level of 1–3 μrad (RMS) for near-surface tilt observations and a noise level of 0.2–0.3 μrad (RMS) for borehole tilt measurements at a depth of 50–100 m. The threshold of detectable tidal tilt admittance changes for the borehole tiltmeters was lowered to 2% but no significant changes were seen. Four coseismic changes in the levels of water in boreholes were observed (all were drops in water level) which were much larger than expected on the basis of elastic dislocation theory. It is suggested that these could be explained either by the collapse of a dilatant zone around the respective hypocentres or by triggered aseisnuc movement on a nearby active fault. Borehole water level tides observed from 1980 to 1986 exhibit significant variations in amplitude and phase which are thought to be the result of time-varying elastic properties in a nearby structure. Some constraints can now be placed on the long-term deformation of the CSZ as a whole from tiltmeter, levelling and horizontal surveys. Data from a levelling array observed from 1976 to 1986 puts a limit of 0.54 μ rad/yr on the secular tilt rate at the observatory: a further limit of 0.1 μ rad/yr is provided by borehole tilt measurements over the period 1983–1986. A limit of 2 cm is placed on vertical movements northwest of the St. Lawrence River by levelling surveys in 1965, 1978, 1980 and 1982. No significant (90% confidence) deviatoric strain has been detected across the CSZ from horizontal control surveys carried out in 1912–1919, 1965, 1978 and 1983: the maximum allowable long-term strain rate across the CSZ from 1919 to 1983 is 0.16 μ strain/yr.",""
"operation planning of standalone maritime power systems using particle swarm optimization","2019","This paper presents the power management system (PMS) that relies on optimal power planning and maximum energy efficiency in dynamic positioning (DP) drilling vessel. Nowadays, it is becoming an improving demand for higher precision and decreases ship motion induced by environmental disturbance such as wind, waves, and sea current, which leads to the use of power generation more efficient. According to this, an efficient strategy solution and schedule have increased significantly for power management of diesel generator (DG) units on marine vessels as an independent microgrid to the utility grid. Thus, the power management system (PMS) of vessels is proposed to monitor and prevent the blackout by using the model predictive controller (MPC) based on optimal control method in order to estimate the future power demand in the hostile environment. Due to nonlinear characteristics of diesel generators, such as power ramp rate limits and non-smooth cost functions, a particle swarm optimization (PSO) is applied to solve the economic dispatch (ED) problem for a dynamic system. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method can improve ED operation problems more efficiently while meeting DGs constraints.","ED operation problems,nonsmooth cost functions,economic dispatch,diesel generator units,maximum energy efficiency,diesel-electric generators,economic dispatch problem,optimal control,dynamic positioning drilling vessel,Power management system,optimal power planning,environmental disturbance,model predictive controller,power grids,power generation control,ship motion,dynamic system,standalone maritime power systems operation planning,power system management,particle swarm optimisation,predictive control,power generation economics,optimal control method,ships,utility grid,marine vessels,the dynamic positioning system,microgrid,particle swarm optimization,power generation dispatch,future power demand,MPC,marine power systems,PMS,DGs constraints,power ramp rate limits,power generation planning,energy conservation,PSO,power generation,distributed power generation,"

A distinct sand layer in the most recent sediments is attributed to Hurricane Juan, which struck the coast of Nova Scotia on September 29, 2003. Our study shows that peaks in grain size farther down-core are generally correlated with abrupt increases in Br and Br/Ti. XRF-derived Br measurements are an indicator of marine organic carbon (MOC), and the increases in Br likely reflect incursions of marine water and nutrients into the lake as a result of storm surges. The results show that the period from ~1475 to 1670 CE contains at least 3–4 storm beds, and are interpreted as the most active TC period within the last ~800 years for this region. Our results are consistent with recent research from Salt Pond, Massachusetts (Donnelly et al. 2015), which provides evidence for heightened TC activity during the same period as our study at Robinson Lake. Our study represents one of the highest latitude paleotempestological studies from the North Atlantic basin which will help the testing of hypotheses concerning long-term changes in North Atlantic TC activity under future climate change scenarios.","X-ray fluorescence,Grain size analysis,North Atlantic,Tropical cyclones,Paleotempestology,"
"microplastic intrusion into the zooplankton, the base of the marine food chain: evidence from the arabian sea, indian ocean","2023","Microplastics (MPs) are ubiquitous in the marine environment, yet information regarding their occurrence in the food web is limited. We investigated the concentration and composition of MPs in water and diverse zooplankton groups from the Arabian Sea basin. Forty-one zooplankton tows were collected with a bongo net (330 μm mesh) from the Arabian Sea in January 2019. MPs in the surface water varied between 0 and 0.055 particles/m3, with a relatively higher concentration (0.013 ± 0.002 particles/m3) in the central Arabian Sea. Though fibrous MPs were most abundant in the seawater (77.14 %), zooplankton prefers small fragments (55.3 %). The size of MPs was distinctly smaller (277.1 ± 46.74 μm) in zooplankton than that in seawater (864.32 ± 73.72 μm), and MPs bioaccumulation was observed in almost all the zooplankton functional groups. Polymer composition revealed polyamide, polyethylene, polypropylene, and PVC were abundant in water and zooplankton, suggesting that the textile, fishing, shipping, and packaging industries are significant sources. The prevailing northeasterly winds, strong West India Coastal Current, and conducive westward radiated Rossby wave during January 2019 have carried the microplastic contaminated water mass away from the coast, posing a threat to the open ocean ecosystems. These results demand further attention to investigate the state of plastic pollution in the Arabian Sea basin.","Bioavailability,Ingestion,Food web,Arabian Sea,Zooplankton,Microplastics,"
"mid-cretaceous sequence stratigraphy and sedimentary cyclicity in the western paris basin","1992","Cenomanian and Turonian depositional patterns of the western Paris Basin are interpreted in terms of sequence stratigraphy. A system tract analysis of the epicontinental “Normandie Basin”, with pelagic chalks, and of the “Maine Platform” covered by clastics, provides evidence for relative changes in coastal onlap; various minor uncomformities are related to these changes of sea level. The four global cycles (UZA or ZC-2.2/2.5) of Haq et al. (1987, 1988) are recognised while an additional one is proposed for the Geslinianum Zone. In addition, periodic rhythmic cycles are commonly registered within the chalk, expressed by the repitition of various facies enhanced both by biosedimentary processes and diagenetic alteration. These elementary climatic cycles allow accurate lithostratigraphic correlations. During this period when the sea level peaked on the tectonically passive border of the Armorican block, the Paris Basin appears to record a detailed set of events which can be correlated with those in the Atlantic, Boreal and Tethyan provinces.

"measurement campaign and mathematical model construction for the ship zodiak magnetic signature reproduction","2021","The paper presents the partial work done within the framework of the EDA Siramis II project focused on magnetic signature reproduction of ships. Reproduction is understood here as the ability to determine the magnetic anomaly of the local Earth magnetic field in any direction and at any measurement depth due to the presence of the analysed object. The B-91 type hydrographic ship Zodiak was selected as the real case study. The work was divided into two main stages: the development of a measurement campaign taking into account physical measurements, and the development of a mathematical model on the basis of the measured values. The measurement campaign included: preparation of the measuring range, selection of equipment for the measurement of magnetic quantities and geographical location, and data recording while the ship passes the measuring point according to the designated course. As a result of the measurement campaign, magnetic flux density components were collected in different positions in relation to the measuring instruments and the ship's heading. A multi-dipole model was used to build the mathematical model in accordance with the idea of inverse modelling. The effectiveness of this model was previously checked on synthetic data of virtual ships generated using the finite element method. Experiments performed with simulation models were helpful in determining the structure of the model, the nature of the data, and the number of samples needed to properly determine the multi-dipole model parameters. The parameters were determined using the nonlinear least squares method according to the idea of data fitting. The classical Ridge and Lasso regularization methods were applied to prevent the developed multi-dipole model from overfitting. Other regularization methods based on GPS accuracy marks and modification of fitness functions were also considered. The verification was done using real data: the data generated by the model was compared with patterns recorded during the Zodiak measurement campaign. High degree of conformity of the shape of characteristics was obtained. Moreover, the correctness of model execution was confirmed by low values of quantitative indices such as RMSE and MAE representing modelling errors. The methodology presented in the paper is quite universal and can be used to determine the signatures of other ferromagnetic objects.","Sea measurements,Magnetic anomaly detection,Magnetic variables measurement,Magnetic signatures,Model checking,Electromagnetic modelling,Marine vehicles,Magnetic fields,"
"from research project objectives to milestones by means of requirements traceability realization of an autonomous maritime system","2013","Current research projects are developing technologies that require more and more the integration of different system capabilities placed at geographically-dispersed locations. The challenge when integrating system capabilities is to choose the right system components to be integrated in order to fulfill the deadline given by the project milestones. This paper proposes a method that shows how project objectives are achieved by means of tracing the requirements across the system development lifecycle until the milestones are reached. The approach proposed turns project objectives and its context into user requirements as well as evaluation cases into project milestones. The integration process consists of integrating functional capabilities from the system modules which are the foundation to support operational capabilities. This paper also presents a review of the stages of the system development lifecycle, and architectural elements of the system under development. It also describes aspects of the planning and scheduling for the implementation of an illustrative case study based on an autonomous maritime system, and their impact on the integration process.","remote system development,requirements traceability,system integration,mobile robots,system development lifecycle,architectural element,autonomous maritime system,Accuracy,research project objective,functional capability,Navigation,Robustness,marine vehicles,engineering research projects,Vehicles,geographically-dispersed location,Marine vehicles,Robot kinematics,"
"anomalous behavior detection of marine vessels based on hidden markov model","2018","In recent years, marine traffic has increased dramatically. Therefore, some vessels may show abnormal behaviors which may indicate different dangers or threats, and also decreases the marine security. These abnormal behaviors are called anomalies. Automatic detection of anomalies is one of the current issues in the maritime domain. Similar works have been proposed that often used parameters speed and location to detect anomalies, and also high false alarm rate is one of the main problems of those. In this paper, a novel approach to maritime vessels anomalous behavior detection based on Hidden Markov Model with the use of parameters speed, location and course have been proposed to increase the situational awareness.

"hybrid satellite-uav-terrestrial networks for 6g ubiquitous coverage: a maritime communications perspective","2021","In the coming smart ocean era, reliable and efficient communications are crucial for promoting a variety of maritime activities. Current maritime communication networks (MCNs) mainly rely on marine satellites and on-shore base stations (BSs). The former generally provides limited transmission rate, while the latter lacks wide-area coverage capability. Due to these facts, the state-of-the-art MCN falls far behind terrestrial fifth-generation (5G) networks. To fill up the gap in the coming sixth-generation (6G) era, we explore the benefit of deployable BSs for maritime coverage enhancement. Both unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and mobile vessels are used to configure deployable BSs. This leads to a hierarchical satellite-UAV-terrestrial network on the ocean. We address the joint link scheduling and rate adaptation problem for this hybrid network, to minimize the total energy consumption with quality of service (QoS) guarantees. Different from previous studies, we use only the large-scale channel state information (CSI), which is location-dependent and thus can be predicted through the position information of each UAV/vessel based on its specific trajectory/shipping lane. The problem is shown to be an NP-hard mixed integer nonlinear programming problem with a group of hidden non-linear equality constraints. We solve it suboptimally by using Min-Max transformation and iterative problem relaxation, leading to a process-oriented joint link scheduling and rate adaptation scheme. As observed by simulations, the scheme can provide agile on-demand coverage for all users with much reduced system overhead and a polynomial computation complexity. Moreover, it can achieve a prominent performance close to the optimal solution.","Satellites,unmanned aerial vehicles,fifth-generation networks,maritime communications perspective,NP-hard mixed integer nonlinear programming problem,polynomial computation complexity,nonlinear equality constraints,on-shore base stations,quality of service,optimal control,wide-area coverage capability,current maritime communication networks,maritime coverage enhancement,integer programming,Resource management,MCN,link scheduling,iterative problem relaxation,scheduling,agile on-demand coverage,trajectory-shipping lane,Channel state information (CSI),reliable communications,process-oriented joint link scheduling,large-scale channel state information,Quality of service,Maritime communications,marine satellites,rate adaptation,sixth-generation era,efficient communications,hybrid satellite-UAV-terrestrial networks,rate adaptation problem,6G mobile communication,radio networks,software prototyping,wireless channels,smart ocean era,iterative methods,autonomous aerial vehicles,deployable BSs,6G ubiquitous coverage,Optimization,nonlinear programming,min-max transformation,Unmanned aerial vehicles,Trajectory,energy consumption,trajectory control,computational complexity,marine communication,optimal solution,mobile vessels,transmission rate,maritime communications,unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV),hybrid network,"
"insights from archaeological analysis and interpretation of marine data sets to inform marine cultural heritage management and planning of wave and tidal energy development for orkney waters and the pentland firth, ne scotland","2014","The Orkney archipelago has a rich heritage that includes the Heart of Neolithic Orkney World Heritage Site, Viking settlements, harbours supplying Hudson's Bay Company ships, and the wartime naval base of Scapa Flow. This rich history has left its mark on the seabed but accurate maps showing the location and character of surviving seabed archaeology do not exist to the same extent as for archaeology on land. ORCA Marine was commissioned by Historic Scotland to work with the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland in interrogating marine data sets to enhance historic environment records of Orkney Waters and the Pentland Firth. These waters were prioritised for their history of maritime activity and to help guide planning and developments in an area highlighted by the Scottish Government for marine renewable energy. A variety of recent and legacy datasets, including wreck databases; sonar data gathered by public sector bodies; aerial photography; seabed cores; Admiralty charts; and local knowledge, were examined for their effectiveness in discovering and interpreting marine cultural heritage cost-effectively. A methodology was developed that enabled marine cultural heritage information to be quickly assimilated within the national and regional inventories for dissemination online. Polygonisation of records resulted in GIS-based shapefiles identifying site extents, and areas of archaeological potential in relation to wrecks, submerged prehistoric landscapes, anchorages and fishing areas. Substantial gaps in data coverage were identified and areas of the seabed have been surveyed at resolutions that are sufficient to detect large upstanding remains such as iron shipwrecks but insufficient to identify smaller archaeological features. Other geophysical datasets have been created at a resolution detailed enough to allow the recognition of smaller anomalies but in some cases processing of the data has removed small anomalies of interest to archaeologists. Intensively used marine areas often contain the most artefactual remains such as historic ports being developed to service the marine renewable industry. Zones of high wave and tidal energy favoured for renewable energy devices include navigation channels and hazards where a large number of wrecks are documented. Transmission cable routes cross deep water where 20th-century wartime losses occurred. Planning and development of infrastructure relating to renewables may also interact with significant built heritage and archaeology on the foreshore and coast edge.",""

"identifying the occurrence of lightning and transient luminous events by nadir spectrophotometric observation","2016","We propose a new technique to identify the occurrence of lightning and transient luminous events (TLEs) using multicolor photometric data obtained by space borne nadir measurements. We estimate the spectral characteristics of lightning and TLEs by converting the optical data obtained by the ISUAL limb experiment to the GLIMS nadir geometry. We find that the estimated spectral shapes of TLE-accompanied lightning are clearly different from those of pure lightning. The obtained results show that (1) the intensity of FUV signals and (2) the ratio of 337/red (609–753nm) spectral irradiance are useful to identify the occurrence of TLEs. The occurrence probabilities of TLEs are 10%, 40%, 80%, in the case of lightning events having the 337/red spectral irradiance ratio of 0.95, 2.95, 14.79, respectively. By using the 60% criterion of the 337/red ratio and the existence of FUV emissions, we classify the 1039 GLIMS-observed lightning events into 828 pure lightning and 211 TLE-accompanied lightning. Since the GLIMS trigger level is adjusted to observe extremely-bright events, the occurrence probability of TLEs obtained here most probably reflects the characteristics of energetic lightning. The estimated global map is consistent with previously determined distributions: the highest activities of lightning and TLEs are found over the North/South American continents, African continent, and Asian maritime regions. While the absolute occurrence number of pure lightning and TLE-accompanied lightning are found to maximize in the equatorial region, the occurrence probability of TLEs possibly increase somewhat in the mid-latitude region. Since the occurrence probabilities of TLEs are higher over the ocean than over land, it is likely that the GLIMS-observed TLEs are due primarily to elves which tends to occur more frequently over the ocean.",""

"ship feature extraction from maritime radar data","1997","In large harbours and long channels where congested traffic and critical weather are present, VTS (vessel traffic service) systems are needed for traffic management and control. The requirements for these systems become more and more demanding because of the continuous increase of traffic and adverse meteorological conditions; reliable systems which can help the operators to avoid accidents which can jeopardise the security of people and goods have to be used to increase safety and efficiency. These systems employ mainly radar sensors, suitably placed in order to have a complete coverage of the area to be controlled, because a 24-hours operation in all weather conditions must be assured. In this paper a new methodology to process digitised radar images to extract object features (size, heading, etc.) is presented. Considering that ships arriving to, or departing from, harbours are big objects moving in narrow channels or waterways, information such as length and bow position are fundamental to control the ship movements, to evaluate the distance between two vessels, or between the vessel and fixed objects such as buoys or wharves. Results of extensive measurement campaign carried out in Naples, Leghorn and Genoa harbours are reported.","waterway,maritime radar data,length,traffic management,Feature extraction,bow position,ship feature extraction,harbours,radar sensors,digitised radar images,Leghorn harbour,feature extraction,vessel traffic service,object features,Genoa harbour,wharves,buoys,channels,Naples harbour,"
"large area monitoring with a modis-based disturbance index (di) sensitive to annual and seasonal variations","2009","Disturbance of the vegetated land surface, due to factors such as fire, insect infestation, windthrow and harvesting, is a fundamental driver of the composition forested landscapes with information on disturbance providing critical insights into species composition, vegetation condition and structure. Long-term climate variability is expected to lead to increases in both the magnitude and distribution of disturbances. As a consequence it is important to develop monitoring systems to better understand these changes in the terrestrial biosphere as well to inform managers about disturbance agents more typically captured through specific monitoring programs (such as focused on insect, fire, or agricultural conditions). Changes in the condition, composition and distribution pattern of vegetation can lead to changes in the spectral and thermal signature of the land surface. Using a 6-year time series of MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Land Surface Temperature (LST) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) data we apply a previously proposed Disturbance Index (DI) which has been shown to be sensitive to both continuous and discontinuous change. Using Canada as an example area, we demonstrate the capacity of this Disturbance Index to monitor land dynamics over time. As expected, our results confirm a significant relationship between area flagged as disturbed by the index and area burnt as estimated from other satellite sources (R2=0.78, p<0.0001). The DI also demonstrates a sensitivity to capture and depict changes related to insect infestations. Further, on a regional basis the DI produces change information matching measured wide-area moisture conditions (i.e., drought) and corresponding agricultural outputs. These findings indicate that for monitoring a large area, such as Canada, the time series based DI is a useful tool to aid in change detection and national monitoring activities.","Insect,Disturbance,Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI),Land Surface Temperature (LST),Drought,Coarse spatial resolution,Disturbance Index (DI),MODIS,Fire,"

"maritime target tracking algorithm based on visible light communication","2021","With the continuous growth of coastal industry, port logistics and other demands, traditional regulatory means have been unable to cope with the complex situations of port vessel regulation.

"quantifying shallow-buried maritime archaeological material using sbp acoustics: experimental and in-situ wrecksite survey approaches","2017","The protection of underwater cultural heritage through in-situ preservation as a first option has been consistently emphasised for preserving submerged and waterlogged cultural heritage for future generations. It has also been politically galvanised by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation in the 2001 Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage. The ultimate in-situ preservation goal for many heritage managers is the ability to create and maintain a stable, protective environment. However, as voiced at IKUWA6 international conference in December 2016, â€œif you don't know what's below the protective layer, then in-situ management is silly!â€ Sub-bottom profilers (SBP) have been effectively used for identifying buried pipelines, sedimentary/geological interfaces, and buried timbers where acoustic reflections are strong. The literature is sparse however, when it comes to quantifying the burial depth and material composition of shallow buried archaeological assemblages using non-invasive techniques. Acoustic devices that are relatively easy to operate in shallow coastal waters and provide improved horizontal and vertical resolution, together with the ability to image weak reflectors and those immediately below the seabed surface, are required for improved in-situ underwater cultural heritage management. This paper presents the progressive results using non-linear SBP acoustic technology to address the question â€œwhat is buried below the protective sediment layer?â€ The aim of the research is to quantify the depth of burial of archaeological material, the major buried material types and through time, their degradation state. The assessment is based on experimental and in-situ wreck site measurements. Seventeen `sleepers' (timbers 50 cm long and 12.5 cm wide and deep) of pine and European oak composition have been buried at the James Matthews (1841) wreck site, south of Fremantle, Western Australia, with 10 cm, 30 cm and 50 cm depths of coverage, and with horizontal and vertical grain orientations. The previously excavated, archaeologically surveyed and reburied remains of the snow brig James Matthews provides a complex shipwreck assemblage target in a shallow (0.2-3 m) burial environment. A virtual 3D digital model of the James Matthews shipwreck remains has been constructed for direct inter-comparison with the SPB survey data. Statistical analyses of the raw SBP data reflected from each of the replicated timber `sleeper' types and burial depths, and from the known material types and burial depths on the James Matthews wrecksite, will be used to quantify site specific acoustic, burial depth and material composition relationships.","waterlogged cultural heritage,in-situ wreck site measurements,seafloor phenomena,United Nations educational,buried timbers,maritime archaeological material,nonlinear SBP acoustic technology,James Matthews (1841,timber,IKUWA6 international conference,raw SBP data,material composition relationships,protective environment,in-situ preservation goal,noninvasive techniques,Acoustic beams,submerged heritage,Cultural differences,shallow buried archaeological assemblages,pipelines,acoustic reflections,Three-dimensional displays,burial depth,buried pipelines,Sediments,protective layer,Sub-bottom profiler,shallow coastal waters,scientific and cultural organisation,buried timber sleepers,in-situ wrecksite survey approaches,Acoustics,heritage managers,acoustics,improved in-situ underwater cultural heritage management,buried material types,burial depths,horizontal resolution,in-situ management,Acoustic measurements,Degradation,James Matthews wrecksite,SBP acoustics,archaeologically surveyed reburied remains,James Matthews wreck site,vertical resolution,replicated timber,shallow-buried maritime archaeological material,archaeology,3D digital model,acoustic devices,protective sediment layer,sediments,oceanographic techniques,"
"detection of invalid ais messages using machine learning techniques","2022","Coastal nations monitor maritime activities in the interest of defence, security, and safety. This form of monitoring typically occurs at operations centers that visualize the maritime environment by creating a Recognized Maritime Picture (RMP) covering a particular area of interest. The creation of this picture changed drastically with the introduction of the Automatic Identification System (AIS). AIS messages are known to contain numerous types of errors and in April 2020 a unique error was found in the data stream. This error consisted of messages indicating the appearance of over 200 vessels in the North Atlantic taking part in a yacht race when in fact no race or physical ships existed. The following work explores the application of various machine learning (ML) techniques to help identify these types of fabricated AIS messages. Specific ML techniques were explored including: K-means clustering, Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Feed-Forward Neural Networks (FNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and One-Class Support Vector Machines (One-SVM). The results showed that DT, RF, and FNN best identified the fabricated AIS messages with F1 scores greater than 93 percent on the test data.","maritime domain awareness,AIS,automatic identification system,machine learning,"
"assessment of trace metal contamination in surficial fine-grained sediments and mussel, mytilus galloprovincialis from safi areas in the northwestern atlantic coast of morocco","2020","During the spring season, trace metal concentrations of cadmium (Cd) and copper (Cu) were investigated in surficial fine-grained sediments and the blue mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis. The study was conducted on the Atlantic coast of Morocco at two selected points along Safi shores, a supposed clean station and a recognized metal-contaminated one. The main objectives were to assess the pollution status of these two stations and to highlight the environmental and human risks associated with metal contamination. The bioavailability and the bioaccumulation of the selected metals, several physiological and biometric parameters of mussels were assessed at both sampling stations. As expected, the station located near industry plants showed the highest metal concentrations in the two compartments and was associated with lower values in the physiological and biometric indices. At the mussel scale, inter-station and inter-tissue variations in metal concentrations were observed showing a preferential accumulation within the digestive gland. Besides, strong reliable negative relations of Cd and Cu concentrations were obtained with physiological indices. Surprisingly, a significant occurrence of both selected metals was recorded at the location assumed as a reference station. Therefore, the hypothesis that this station presumed to be clean and currently used as a control station must be reconsidered.

"robust navigation and communication in the maritime domain: the triton project","2014","Intentional jamming and spoofing are growing concerns for communication and positioning systems based on Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS). In the maritime sector, intentional interfering signals might induce poor performance of the GNSS receivers, that, in severe cases, are unable to provide reliable measurements. On board of vessels, the failure of the GNSS receiver propagates to multiple systems, like the Automatic Information System (AIS) transponder, the ship's gyro calibration system and the digital selective calling system. The AIS itself can suffer from failures due to interference in the VHF band, and the lack of bandwidth makes it difficult to introduce security any security mechanisms. The vulnerability to intentional interference as well as the availability of personal privacy devices easily sold over the Internet motivate attackers who intend to fraud services and get direct benefits.","fraud services,ship gyro calibration system,GNSS receivers,transponders,Marine vehicles,TRITON project,digital selective calling system,security mechanisms,marine navigation,Global Positioning System,robust navigation,VHF band,interference suppression,intentional spoofing,positioning systems,intentional interfering signals,Ship Reporting Systems,ships,satellite navigation,automatic information system,Jamming,interference mitigation,maritime domain,radiofrequency interference,vessels,Robustness,AIS transponder,calibration,marine communication,Receivers,failure analysis,radio receivers,Interference,maritime sector,personal privacy devices,Internet,Global Navigation Satellite System,Security,security,intentional jamming,"
"colour of bovine subcutaneous adipose tissue: a review of contributory factors, associations with carcass and meat quality and its potential utility in authentication of dietary history","2009","The colour of bovine subcutaneous (sc) adipose tissue (carcass fat) depends on the age, gender and breed of cattle. Diet is the most important extrinsic factor but its influence depends on the duration of feeding. Cattle produced under extensive grass-based production systems generally have carcass fat which is more yellow than their intensively-reared, concentrate-fed counterparts and this is caused by carotenoids from green forage. Although yellow carcass fat is negatively regarded in many countries, evidence suggests it may be associated with a healthier fatty acid profile and antioxidant content in beef, synonymous with grass feeding. Nonetheless, management strategies to reduce fat colour of grass-fed cattle are sought after. Current research suggests that yellow colour of this tissue is reduced if pasture-fed cattle are converted to a grain-based diet, which results in accretion of adipose tissue and dilution of carotenoids. Colour changes may depend on the initial yellow colour, the carotene and utilisable energy in the finishing diet, the duration of finishing, the amount of fat accumulated during finishing and the rate of utilisation of carotene from body fat. Differences in nutritional strategies which cause differences in fatty acid composition may be reflected by differences in fat colour and carotenoid concentration. Fat colour and carotenoids are prominent among a panoply of measurements which can aid the authentication of the dietary history and thus to some extent, the origin of beef, although this potential utility is complicated by the simultaneous rather than discrete use of forages and concentrates in real production systems.","Carcass fat,Bovine,Colour,Carotenoids,Subcutaneous adipose tissue,"
"palaeolimnological evidence for widespread late 18th century drought across equatorial east africa","2008","The sediment records of three shallow climate-sensitive lakes in equatorial East Africa (Chibwera and Kanyamukali in western Uganda, and Baringo in central Kenya) contain clear lithological evidence of an episode of complete desiccation in the relatively recent past. Quantitative stratigraphic analyses of bulk sediment composition, texture (% sand and coarse organic detritus), the C/N ratio of bulk organic matter, and magnetic susceptibility allowed us to define a common succession of sedimentary units in all three lakes. This common stratigraphy includes a basal unit of dry and stiff low-organic clays capped by a horizon of peaty mud or peat, overlain by organic lake sediment. We interpret this stratigraphy to represent an episode of (nearly) complete desiccation of these lake basins. This was followed first by an early phase of modest lake refilling, during which time extensive littoral and submerged vegetation developed, producing peaty lake deposits. Mostly higher lake levels later on resulted in deposition of fine-grained lake muds. Using 210Pb and 137Cs activity profiles combined with four AMS 14C dates on single terrestrial plant macrofossils or multiple charred grass particles indicate that in all three lakes the episode of most recent complete desiccation occurred in the late 18th and early 19th century. These results add to an accumulating body of palaeoenvironmental data revealing a prolonged period of extreme drought in equatorial East Africa about 200 years ago, also documented in the cultural history of the African Great Lakes region. Given the geographical spread of the study lakes across the East African plateau, these results indicate that the climatic anomaly of reduced rainfall responsible for this drought was at least sub-continental in scale.","Tropical East Africa,Palaeoclimate,Late Holocene,Sediment stratigraphy,Lake Baringo,Lake-sediment records,"

The determination of background concentrations of metals, undertaken for the first time in this environment, proved to be particularly important for Ni and Cr, which are naturally enriched in the sediments of the southern Adriatic. The results showed widespread moderate contamination with Pb and Sn since the 1970s, while the upper layers of sediments near shipyards, marinas and urban areas were more contaminated with Sn, Cu, Pb, Zn, Cd, As, Sb and Mo. The transport of material through the narrow straits separating different parts of Boka Kotorska Bay resulted in a different geochemical composition of the smaller bays and a limited distribution of contaminated sediments from local sources.","Southern Adriatic,Metal pollution,History of pollution,Semi-enclosed marine system,Local background,"
"integrated late quaternary chronostratigraphy for san salvador island, bahamas: patterns and trends of morphological change in the land snail cerion","2008","Reconstructing the phylogeny and biogeography of the Caribbean land snail Cerion requires a robust stratigraphic and chronological framework. To this end, we have determined the stratigraphic succession on San Salvador, a Bahamian island with a rich fossil and modern Cerion fauna. A primary purpose of this paper is to independently verify this succession through whole-rock and Cerion aminostratigraphies and AMS 14C-based age models. Over 150 individual Cerion shells were age-ranked from 140 ka to modern using stratigraphic position and reverse-phase HPLC (RPC) amino acid racemization, which was sufficiently sensitive to resolve stratigraphic subunits within the Holocene and late Pleistocene. A secondary purpose of this paper is to assess broad changes in the gross morphology (height, width) of supersets of Cerion from age-ranked lots spanning this ~140 kyr chronostratigraphy. Through each of the three interglacial sequences (i.e., marine isotope stages 5e, 5a, and 1), between-sample trends in mean gross morphology often greatly exceed within-sample variances (±1σ). Live-collected Cerion exhibit a range in gross morphology that nearly encompasses that of the entire fossil sequence. A trend of increasing gross shell size characterizes each of the interglacial phases, with a major step-decrease between marine isotope stages 5a and 1. While between-unit variation is often great in Cerion from SSI, within-unit variation appears unimodal through the record.","land snails,Reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography,The Bahamas,San Salvador Islands,Accelerator mass spectrometry C chronology,Biostratigraphy,Amino acid racemization,"

"spatio-temporal analysis of aerosol optical depth using rotated empirical orthogonal function over the maritime continent from 2001 to 2020","2022","The deterioration in the annual air quality of the Maritime Continent (MC) is mainly caused by biomass burning haze (BBH) and the surrounding atmospheric conditions. This study aims to investigate the spatial and temporal variations of the aerosol optical depth (AOD) and its relationship with biomass burning and climate anomaly factors in the MC from 2001 to 2020. Using aerosol model reanalysis products from the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA-2), values of the aerosol optical depth (AOD) over the MC were collected and processed to obtain a better understanding of the characteristics of the aerosol loading over the MC. Using the varimax rotated empirical orthogonal function (REOF) approach, we assess the spatio-temporal distributions of the AOD over the MC from 2001 to 2020. The REOF maximized the variances explained for the primary modes and has shown clearer relationship between the spatiotemporal patterns of identified modes. The first three REOF modes of the AOD accounted for a total variance of 73.7%. The first mode (REOF1) explaining 35.8% is the main mode that represent fire burning that concentrated over the 0° latitude. REOF1 represents the emission from burning activities which primarily occurred in the Kalimantan and Sumatra based on their correlation with the total hotspots, which reach 0.73, which a certain extent of correlation with the climate anomalies, including El Niño, positive DM, and their coincidence. The second (REOF2) also explaining 35.8% represents the AOD distribution influenced by the biomass burning emission transported from the Indochina in the area to the north of 5°N which has an opposite mode with the general mode in MC except for Java area. Meanwhile, PC3 AOD has reduced to 2.2% in the rotation process and represent the influence of monsoon movement on the AOD level. In short, the study highlights spatial and temporal AOD distribution and the phenomena of burning mass and climate indices in the long-term MERRA reanalysis dataset to allow more understanding of the causal links of AOD in MC to the climate features.","Indian ocean dipole,Aerosol optical depth,El Niño southern oscillation,Maritime continent,"
"integrated characterization of ancient burial mounds using ert and limited drillings at the hepu han tombs, in coastal area of southern china","2019","The Hepu Han Tombs, located on the south coast of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, in southern China, bordering the Beibu Gulf, can date back to the Han dynasty (206 BCE–220 CE), when Hepu was an important international trade port of the maritime Silk Road, spreading strong and persistent cultural influence to neighboring countries from ancient China, and also connecting China with African, European and other Asian countries in national migration, religious communication, political, trade, technical and cultural exchanges, and so on. The research of the Hepu Han Tombs can offer opportunities to understand the burial customs and the Han culture in the Chinese Han Dynasty. With the aim of detecting the location, depth and geometry of two burial mounds at Jinjiling Site of Hepu Han Tombs, an electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) survey was performed in cooperation with archaeological team to calibrate the results with detailed information from the limited drillings in the area. Besides, series of 2-D ERT sections, acquired above the larger mound, were combined into a “Pseudo 3-D” volume, and iso-resistivity surfaces were further calculated to emphasize the location and lateral variations within the data volume, expected towards a more detailed and quantitative interpretation. Both the 2-D and 3-D resistivity imaging gave a clear evidence of structural details of the burial mounds. The results have shown a general consistency between the geophysical work and traditional archaeological drilling explorations, improving our knowledge on the un-excavated mounds, and allowing detailed pre-excavation plan at the Hepu Han Tombs.","Burial mounds,Hepu Han Tombs,Electrical resistivity tomography (ERT),Drillings,"
"fostering marine internet with advanced maritime radio system using spectrums of cellular networks","2016","Marine Internet aims at providing Internet service in marine environments for applications on and under water surface. But now only satellite can provide such kind of service, which is expensive and not cost-effectively for ever-increasing human activities in the ocean. Meanwhile, the maritime radio system, which is primarily used by maritime transportation industry for navigation, distress handling as well as rescue and safety operations, also finds difficulties in satisfying ever-increasing demand on communication capacity to realize safe, green and intelligent maritime transport. This is mainly due to the fact that a limited amount of bandwidth is allocated to this system. Different from many proposals available in the literature, which address these two issues separately, this paper discusses an architecture to handle them together by exploiting the spectrums licensed to mobile cellular networks. It is expected to enhance the maritime radio system while fostering the deployment of marine Internet in water areas near coastlines with reduced deployment cost.","Satellites,licensed radio spectrum,marine Internet deployment,Marine Internet,maritime transport safety,bandwidth allocation,Mobile communication,maritime radio system,advanced maritime radio system,Internet service,cellular radio,Oceans,mobile cellular networks,intelligent maritime transport,Bandwidth,Satellite broadcasting,Web and internet services,green maritime transport,marine communication,Internet,frequency allocation,communication capacity,"
"tracing the flow of carbon dioxide and water vapor between the biosphere and atmosphere: a review of optical isotope techniques and their application","2013","Development of optical isotope techniques over the last several years has provided scientists a set of tools for tracing the transport and cycling of CO2 and water vapor between the biosphere and atmosphere. Here, I take a micrometeorological perspective and review these technological advances, assess key instrument performance characteristics, examine how these techniques have been used in the field to improve our understanding of the processes governing the exchange of CO2 and water vapor, and discuss future research directions. Review of the recent literature indicates that: (1) optical techniques have been used to quantify the isotope composition of biosphere–atmosphere exchange using the traditional Keeling mixing line, flux–gradient, eddy covariance, and chamber approaches under a variety of field conditions with near-continuous data records now extending to more than 5-years; (2) high frequency and near continuous isotope measurements at the canopy scale have demonstrated important new insights regarding the behaviour of kinetic fractionation at the leaf versus canopy scales and the controls on ecosystem respiration that could not have been observed previously using traditional methods; (3) based on the assessment of instrument performance, carbon isotope disequilibrium (the difference between the isotope composition of photosynthesis and respiration), carbon turnover rates, and measurement uncertainties, 13C-CO2 investigations are best suited for examining the contributions and changes to ecosystem respiration with a need for more innovative 13C-isotope labeling experiments and compound specific isotope analyses under field conditions; (4) significant progress has been made in measuring the oxygen isotope composition of water vapor fluxes and canopy leaf water enrichment. These new data have provided an opportunity to evaluate models of leaf water enrichment and their application to the canopy scale; and (5) the use of 18O-H2O and 18O-CO2 as tracers of the coupled carbon–water cycle has matured significantly in recent years. Evidence from a range of ecosystems indicates that 18O-CO2 disequilibrium (ranging from 0 to 17‰) is much larger than for 13C-CO2 (typical less than 3‰ in natural C3 ecosystems) making it a useful tracer of coupled carbon and water cycle processes. However, a better understanding of the role of carbonic anhydrase in photosynthetic and respiratory processes under field conditions is now needed in order to make further progress. Finally, the increasing use and development of isotope-enabled land surface schemes along with the acquisition of high temporal resolution isotope data is providing a new opportunity to constrain the carbon and water cycle processes represented in these models.","Kinetic fractionation,Photosynthesis,Keeling plot,Evapotranspiration,Carbon,Lasers,Scaling issues,Mass spectrometry,Micrometeorology,Isotopes,Leaf water enrichment,Spectroscopy,Eddy covariance,Respiration,Water vapor,"
"stratigraphic pattern of soil remnants, cultural and colluvial deposits in a small dry valley in the viking settlement hedeby, northern germany","2023","This study aimed to identify spatial distribution of soil remnants, colluvial and cultural deposits in a small dry valley of the early medieval Viking settlement Hedeby; reconstruct factors of soil destruction and main phases of deposits formation. Hedeby (54° 29′ 27.77″ N, 9° 33′ 54.42″ E) is located approximately 40 km northwest of Kiel, Northern Germany, at the western shore of the lake Haddebyer Noor. The protected status of the settlement as a UNESCO heritage site predetermined the choice of a minimum-destructive technique of coring. The stratigraphy demonstrated that the main factors of soil destruction were surface erosion, incorporation of the soil horizon A into a cultural layer and extraction of soil material for earthwork formation such as construction of the semi-circular fortification rampart. Buried soil horizons were additionally mixed by active local bioturbation. Three periods of deposit formation were identified. The occurrence of soil erosion due to intensive deforestation in the earliest period of settlement erection was indicated by the deepest colluvial layer M1. During the Viking settlement period formation of the exposed colluvial layer M2 and cultural deposits must have been simultaneous but at different locations. After the Viking Age settlement period, the erosion was activated by agricultural land use in late medieval time. This was clearly seen in the central part of the valley, where cultural deposits were covered by colluvium. This study closes a gap in the long-term archaeological and geoarchaeological study of Hedeby, i.e. it contributes to the discussion of the relationship between human activity and landscape development in this significant settlement. Moreover, it brings new knowledge on the large-scale vision of the landscape transformation performed by Viking Age settlers.","Viking Age,Hedeby,Colluvial deposits,Deposit modeling,Past soil erosion,Palaeoenvironmental reconstruction,"

"ldsn: localization scheme for double-head maritime sensor networks","2014","Ocean covers nearly 71% of our planet's surface, yet 95% of the ocean remains unexplored by human being, and wireless sensor networks are envisioned to perform monitoring tasks over the large portion of our world. However, deploying wireless sensor networks on the sea poses many challenges and for maritime surveillance security applications we may need to deploy sensors both on the sea surface and underwater for three-dimensional detection. In this paper, we propose a hybrid ocean sensor networks called Double-head maritime Sensor Networks (DSNs), which combine the advantages of wireless sensor networks and underwater acoustic sensor networks. By leveraging the unique characteristics of DSNs, we design a localization scheme LDSN which is consisted of two algorithms SML and FLA. We first use SML to localize moored anchor nodes as seed nodes. After the underwater sensor networks have been localized, the floating double-head nodes can figure out its instant position via FLA algorithm. We evaluate the scheme by simulations and the results show that the scheme can achieve a high localization accuracy.","seed node,Wireless Sensor Networks,wireless sensor network,Wireless sensor networks,hybrid ocean sensor network,three-dimensional detection,underwater acoustic sensor network,maritime surveillance security application,sensor placement,wireless sensor networks,floating double-head node,Sea surface,FLA algorithm,LDSN,Tides,Underwater acoustics,moored anchor node,marine communication,Localization,Surveillance,double-head maritime sensor network,SML,Underwater Sensor Networks,localization scheme,"
"spectrum sensing for cognitive maritime vhf networks","2014","The Automatic Identification System (AIS) is used worldwide as a maritime system for identifying and locating vessels by exchanging data in Very High Frequency (VHF) band with other nearby ships, AIS base stations and satellites. It is an important system for safety of navigation to assist collision avoidance and enables marine traffic supervision and management. However, the expanding use of AIS band by other emerging applications and services has caused significant increase on the maritime VHF Data Link (VDL) load, hampering smooth exchange of critical AIS information. Instead of assigning new frequency resources for new marine VDL services, in this paper we present a solution to overcome this spectrum scarcity issue by utilizing Cognitive Radio (CR) technology in maritime AIS VHF network. A preliminary analysis of the performance of such an approach is carried out taking into account the different properties and challenges of marine communication channels due to sea surface movement.

"satellite-based communications security: a survey of threats, solutions, and research challenges","2022","Satellite-based Communication (SATCOM) systems are gaining renewed momentum in Industry and Academia, thanks to innovative services introduced by leading tech companies and the promising impact they can deliver towards the global connectivity objective tackled by early 6G initiatives. On the one hand, the emergence of new manufacturing processes and radio technologies promises to reduce service costs while guaranteeing outstanding communication latency, available bandwidth, flexibility, and coverage range. On the other hand, cybersecurity techniques and solutions applied in SATCOM links should be updated to reflect the substantial advancements in attacker capabilities characterizing the last two decades. However, business urgency and opportunities are leading operators towards challenging system trade-offs, resulting in an increased attack surface and a general relaxation of the available security services. In this paper, we tackle the cited problems and present a comprehensive survey on the link-layer security threats, solutions, and challenges faced when deploying and operating SATCOM systems. Specifically, we classify the literature on security for SATCOM systems into two main branches, i.e., physical-layer security and cryptography schemes. Then, we further identify specific research domains for each of the identified branches, focusing on dedicated security issues, including, e.g., physical-layer confidentiality, anti-jamming schemes, anti-spoofing strategies, and quantum-based key distribution schemes. For each of the above domains, we highlight the most essential techniques, peculiarities, advantages, disadvantages, lessons learned, and future directions. Finally, we also identify emerging research topics whose additional investigation by Academia and Industry could further attract researchers and investors, ultimately unleashing the full potential behind ubiquitous satellite communications.","GNSS spoofing,Quantum key distribution for satellites,Satellite-drones communications,Cryptography for satellites,6G,Satellites cybersecurity,Satellites jamming,3GPP,"
"high-squint sar imaging of maritime ship targets","2022","High-squint synthetic aperture radar (HS-SAR) imaging technology greatly enhances the flexibility of SAR. However, the existing HS-SAR imaging algorithms are generally based on the assumption that the illuminated target is static during the synthetic aperture formation. As a consequence, the state-of-the-art algorithms are unable to focus on moving targets well, thus leading to displaced and blurred images of the targets. A maritime ship is a typical kind of moving target with complex noncooperative motion, which has received much attention. Thus, it is a difficult but valuable issue to study HS-SAR imaging of ship targets. In this work, the influence of ship translation and fluctuation is theoretically analyzed. On the basis of these analyses, the new conception of â€œthird range compression (TRC)â€ caused by ship translation is proposed, and the squint minimization (SM) operation is implemented for the compensation of TRC. Moreover, considering that the target Doppler parameters induced by ship fluctuation are related to its position, a novel method called WASH-CLEAN (watershed and CLEAN) is proposed to automatically focus ship scattering points with different swings. Finally, we propose an integrated modified range-Doppler (RD) imaging algorithm by combining the advantages of HS-SAR and inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR).

"change detection support for supervisory controllers of highly automated systems: effects on performance, mental workload, and recovery of situation awareness following interruptions","2018","Dynamic Positioning (DP) is a computer-controlled process to automatically keep a floating vessel at a specific position or to follow a pre-defined path (tracking) by using its own propellers and thrusters. The human supervisory controller has no direct need to constantly know what the status is of all parts of the automation and the system it is controlling, because the highly automated DPS is controlling all components itself. Only after a failure arises, the operator needs to take over manual control and take appropriate action(s) to prevent the failure from harming the operation. As the supervisory controller may be out of the loop, swiftly taking over control may be problematic when failures arise. The purpose of the current study was to investigate whether automation of change detection enables human operators with low awareness of the automation and the system it is controlling to quickly recover awareness in emergency take-over situations. A 2 by 2 within subjects experiment was conducted using a DP simulation (n = 22). Within-subjects factors were support (Yes, No) and interruption (Yes, No). Results showed that change detection support helps in the process of recovering situation awareness after it has been reduced, due to an interruption of the primary task of overseeing the automation. Interestingly, support was not beneficial to the participants in all conditions. In non-interrupted conditions the support unexpectedly resulted in higher workload, raising questions whether supervisory controllers should be supported continuously or only when it is required. Relevance to industry: The results show that change detection support has potential value in operational maritime environments, especially in situations where the DP operator has low situation awareness. Future research should investigate whether adaptive aiding could alleviate some of the negative effects of non-adaptive operator support in maritime environments.","Management-by-exception,Situation Awareness Recovery (SAR),Dynamic positioning,Human-automation collaboration,Out-of-the-loop (OOTL) performance problem,"
"context-enhanced vessel prediction based on ornstein-uhlenbeck processes using historical ais traffic patterns: real-world experimental results","2014","Traffic route analysis and prediction are both essential for maritime security. Specifically, the prediction of a vessel position is useful to provide alerts about upcoming events (e.g., opportunities and threats). However, accurate prediction along a route in the maritime domain is a challenging task, due to the complex and dynamic nature of traffic patterns. This paper presents a vessel prediction method, based on the popular Ornstein-Uhlenbeck stochastic processes, whose parameters are estimated from historical patterns of life. The historical traffic routes are obtained by pre-processing Automatic Identification System (AIS) data via the CMRE tool called Traffic Route Extraction for Anomaly Detection (TREAD). These recurrent routes allow prediction of the position of a vessel that is following one of these routes, surprisingly, by several hours. The method is validated using a case study related to the second data campaign of the EC FP7 Project New Service Capabilities for Integrated and Advanced Maritime Surveillance (NEREIDS)1.

Individual decision-making is taken as a node in workflow, and the network workflow among decision-making units is examined in a larger scope by establishing the interactive network between nodes. On this basis, the control model of human decision-making errors is further constructed, including the accumulation, transmission and correction of decision-making errors. Finally, taking maritime emergency rescue as an example, this paper studies the capability of the fault control model to identify and correct faults in the decision-making workflow.

However, the offloading rate and delay in the offshore region are limited by the coverage of the onshore base station (BS). In this paper, we investigate the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted data offloading for smart containers in offshore maritime communications where the UAV is as a relay node between smart containers and onshore BS. We first consider the mobility of container vessel in the offshore region and establish a UAV-assisted data offloading model. Based on this model, a data offloading algorithm is proposed to reduce the average offloading delay under data-size requirements and available energy constraints of smart containers. Specifically, the convex-concave procedure is used to update time-slot assignment, offloading approach selection, and power allocation in an iterative manner. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can efficiently reduce average offloading delay and increase offloading success ratio. Moreover, it is shown that the UAV relay cannot always bring the performance gain on offloading delay especially in the close-to-shore area, which could give an insight on the deployment of UAV relay in offshore communications.","data offloading algorithm,average offloading delay,offshore maritime communications,time-slot assignment update,smart container,offshore communications,container status monitoring,offloading rate,convex programming,Monitoring,Delays,UAV relay,offloading approach selection,data-size requirements,concave programming,Containers,Relays,Maritime communications,unmanned aerial vehicle,data offloading,freight containers,Data models,UAV-assisted data offloading model,offshore region,container vessel,maritime Internet of Things,unmanned aerial vehicle-assisted data offloading,Autonomous aerial vehicles,offloading success ratio,autonomous aerial vehicles,telecommunication traffic,marine communication,"

An uncertainty analysis showed that if, on one hand, the site heterogeneity and set-up changes may strongly affect yearly NEP estimates, questioning thus the total carbon budget relevance, on the other hand, robust inter-annual anomalies may be obtained as long as a site dedicated data treatment is carefully applied. A validation of the anomalies by comparison with a growth index derived from tree ring measurements is given. The resulting anomalies (range: [−206; + 123] g C m−2 yr−1, standard deviation: 93 g C m−2 yr−1) being larger than their own uncertainty (∼30 g C m−2 yr−1), an inter-annual variability analysis is possible. This analysis shows that the sources of NEP inter-annual variability at the Vielsalm station are multiple but the most prominent causes are biotic processes driven by carry-over effects of preceding meteorological events. The lowest observed NEP, in 2000, resulted from a bark beetle attack probably prompted by an early frost event in 1998. Besides, the robust lagged correlation between NEP anomalies and mean vapor pressure deficit during the preceding vegetation season also suggests a carry-over effect of water limitation during the previous year on the beech NEP. Mechanisms driving this carry-over effect are supposedly linked to tree physiology, which is confirmed by a dependency of canopy photosynthetic capacity to previous year water limitation. Some hypotheses, involving biomass allocation and bud formation, are proposed to explain its lagged impact on canopy photosynthetic capacity. Other causes of NEP inter-annual variability are the radiation during the current vegetation season and the temperature at the end of the winter but the latter variable rather indicates an effect on the conifers interspersed in the plot. Overall, the photosynthetic capacity combined with these two factors explained about 75% of NEP inter-annual variability.","Eddy covariance,Net Ecosystem Productivity,Interannual variability,Forest ecosystem,"
"knowledge extraction from maritime spatiotemporal data: an evaluation of clustering algorithms on big data","2017","In this paper we attempt to define the major trade routes which vessels of trade follow when travelling across the globe in a scalable, data-driven unsupervised way. For this, we exploit a large volume of historical AIS data, so as to estimate the location and connections of the major trade routes, with minimal reliance on other sources of information. We address the challenges posed due to the volume of data by leveraging distributed computing techniques and present a novel MapReduce based algorithmic approach, capable of handling skewed and nonuniform geospatial data. In the direction, we calculate and compare the performance (execution time and compression ratio) and accuracy of several mature clustering algorithms and present preliminary results.","Apache Spark,data mining,Clustering algorithms,Spatiotemporal phenomena,execution time,Ports (Computers),minimal reliance,scalable data,Geospatial analysis,mature clustering algorithm evaluation,trade vessel,nonuniform geospatial data,data analysis,distributed computing techniques,marine engineering,MapReduce based algorithmic approach,Clustering Algorithms evaluation,AIS,maritime spatiotemporal data,pattern clustering,Artificial intelligence,trade routes,Big Data,parallel processing,knowledge extraction,skewed data,Shipping routes,Trajectory,Big Spatiotempotal Data,Algorithm design and analysis,compression ratio,historical AIS data,"
"bio-inspired topology control mechanism for autonomous underwater vehicles used in maritime surveillance","2013","Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are increasingly used in maritime applications to acquire underwater information. With the guidance of intelligent topology control algorithms, AUVs adjust their positions efficiently such that they achieve desired underwater wireless sensor network (UWSN) configurations. A suitable application can be using AUVs in surveillance tasks, where they uniformly spread throughout a harbor entry or around a large civilian or military maritime vessel (e.g., an aircraft carrier) to detect any hostile or unexpected underwater intrusions. Since geographical characteristics are different for each port (shape, depth, etc.) and underwater currents constantly change, manually controlling underwater vehicles for these tasks is not feasible. In this paper, we present a particle swarm optimization (PSO) based topology control mechanism, called 3D-PSO, for AUVs operating in unknown 3D underwater spaces. 3D-PSO uses limited information collected from an AUV's neighborhood to make movement decisions over an unknown 3D space. Each AUV, using our 3D-PSO, is able to adjust its movement speed and direction to achieve a better location towards obtaining a uniform distribution. Simulation experiments demonstrate that, despite the significant variance of topographies of harbor entrances and the undersides of ships, 3D-PSO is an efficient tool to guide AUVs in creating a protection area for a harbor or a maritime vessel.","surveillance,topology control,bio-inspired topology control mechanism,harbor entrances,underwater information,civilian vessel,bio-inspired algorithms,particle swarm optimisation,3D-PSO,underwater wireless sensor networks,protection area,Network topology,wireless sensor networks,Topology,maritime surveillance,self-organizing networks,particle swarm optimization,autonomous underwater vehicles,Underwater vehicles,unknown 3D underwater spaces,harbor entry,surveillance tasks,military maritime vessel,Nickel,UWSN configurations,marine vehicles,intelligent topology control algorithms,underwater wireless sensor network configuration,AUVs,security,unexpected underwater intrusion detection,Mobile nodes,geographical characteristics,"

One of the major problems is how to capture cost effective information about the hull defect and predict the remaining life? This paper will focus on the automation process for calculation of the failure rate and prediction from collated hull defects information. This data is assessed for accuracy, sensitivity and correctness of defect location and failure modes. An outline of the automation techniques investigated to determine the hull failures rates is discussed. Five major failure modes are analysed and a high level approach for integrating failure data collation is presented.

"threat assessment using context-based tracking in a maritime environment","2009","The main objective of this work is to model and exploit available maritime contextual information to provide a hypothesis on suspicious vessel maneuvers. This concept involves utilizing the L1 tracking to perform L2/L3 data fusion, i.e. refinement and assessment for situations and threats. A new context-based tracker known as the ConTracker is developed. The purpose of the ConTracker is to incorporate the contextual information into a traditional alpha - beta tracker in such a way so that it provides a repeller or an attractor characteristics to a specific region of interest. Any behavior of the vessel that is inconsistent with the repeller or the attractor characteristics of the current vessel location would be classified as suspicious. Such an inconsistent vessel behavior would be directly indicated by a high measurement residual which may be used to estimate an accurate process noise covariance using a multiple-model adaptive estimator. Based on the rate of change of the estimated process noise covariance values, an L2/L3 hypothesis generator red-flags the target vessel. Simulation results indicate that the context based tracking enhances the reliability of erratic maneuver detection.","Traffic control,multiple-model adaptive estimator,Noise generators,L2/L3 fusion,Î± - Î² tracker,Motion estimation,Noise measurement,target tracking,marine systems,State estimation,threat assessment,Aerospace engineering,Target tracking,covariance analysis,contextual information,Trafficability,MMAE,Fusion power generation,context-based tracking,adaptive estimation,suspicious vessel maneuvers,process noise covariance,erratic maneuver detection reliability,maritime environment,Boats,Context modeling,ConTracker,"
"seasonal oceanography from physics to micronekton in the south-west pacific","2015","Tuna catches represent a major economic and food source in the Pacific Ocean, yet are highly variable. This variability in tuna catches remains poorly explained. The relationships between the distributions of tuna and their forage (micronekton) have been mostly derived from model estimates. Observations of micronekton and other mid-trophic level organisms, and their link to regional oceanography, however are scarce and constitute an important gap in our knowledge and understanding of the dynamics of pelagic ecosystems. To fill this gap, we conducted two multidisciplinary cruises (Nectalis1 and Nectalis2) in the New Caledonian Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) at the southeastern edge the Coral Sea, in 2011 to characterize the oceanography of the region during the cool (August) and the hot (December) seasons. The physical and biological environments were described by hydrology, nutrients and phytoplankton size structure and biomass. Zooplankton biomass was estimated from net sampling and acoustics and micronecton was estimated from net sampling, the SEAPODYM ecosystem model, a dedicated echosounder and non-dedicated acoustics. Results demonstrated that New Caledonia is located in an oligotrophic area characterized by low nutrient and low primary production which is dominated by a high percentage of picoplankton cyanobacteria Prochlorococcus (>90%). The area exhibits a large-scale north–south temperature and salinity gradient. The northern area is influenced by the equatorial Warm Pool and the South Pacific Convergence Zone and is characterized by higher temperature, lower salinity, lower primary production and micronekton biomass. The southern area is influenced by the Tasman Sea and is characterized by cooler temperature, higher salinity, higher primary production and micronekton biomass. The dynamic oceanography and the complex topography create a myriad of mesoscale features including eddies, inducing patchy structures in the ecosystem. During the cool season, a tight coupling existed between the ocean dynamics and primary production, while there was a stronger decoupling during the hot season. There was little difference in the composition of mid-trophic level organisms (zooplankton and micronekton) between the two seasons. This may be due to different turn-over times and delays in the transmission of primary production to upper trophic levels. Examination of various sampling gears for zooplankton and micronekton showed that net biomass estimates and acoustic-derived estimates compared reasonably well. Estimates of micronekton from net observations and the SEAPODYM model were in the same range. The non-dedicated acoustics adequately reproduced trends observed in zooplankton from nets, but the acoustics could not differentiate between zooplankton and micronekton and absolute biomasses could not be calculated. Understanding the impact of mesoscale features on higher trophic levels will require further investigation and patchiness induced by eddies raises the question of how to best sample highly dynamic areas via sea experiments.","Primary production,Oceanographic surveys,Oligotrophic,Zooplankton,Acoustic data,Mesoscale eddies,Nekton,"
"radio occultation and ground-based gnss products for observing, understanding and predicting extreme events: a review","2019","In this paper we review the contributions of GNSS ground-based and radio occultation receivers to the understanding and prediction of severe weather phenomena around the world. These ground- and space-based GNSS observations, which are complementary to other in-situ and remotely sensed observations, are sensitive to the temperature and water vapor content of the atmosphere, both important parameters that characterize the structure and evolution of heavy rainfall and convective storms, atmospheric rivers, tropical cyclones, and droughts and heat waves. With the first ground-based GPS observations reported in the early 1990s and the first radio occultation observations of Earth's atmosphere derived from the GPS/MET proof-of-concept mission (1995–1997), these GNSS-based observations are still relatively new contributors to the research and operational suite of technologies.","Heavy-rainfall,Heat waves,GNSS-receivers,Atmospheric-rivers,GNSS,Droughts,Tropical-cyclones,Radio-occultation,Extreme-events,Convective-storms,Ground-based,"
"a systematic mapping study on edge computing approaches for maritime applications","2021","Background: The edge computing paradigm allows to reduce latency and response time of applications by bringing computations and data storage closer to the locations where they are needed. Edge computing is used in different kinds of Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Maritime represents an important application domain for IoT applications and edge computing solutions. Modern vessels employ many different types of sensors, which produce a massive amount of data. Edge computing allows to perform computations and data analyses on-board a vessel or at the edge of the network. Objective: To present a comprehensive, unbiased overview of the state-of-the-art on edge computing approaches for maritime applications. Method: A Systematic Mapping Study (SMS) of the existing edge computing approaches for maritime applications. Results: A taxonomy of 17 papers on edge computing approaches for maritime applications. Conclusion: The results of the study show that there is a small number of existing edge computing approaches for maritime applications. Most of the existing approaches focus mainly on monitoring and communication functions in vessels. Moreover, several research gaps exist with respect to the types of edge computing approaches, the purposes of using edge computing on vessels, and the data analysis techniques used for edge computing on vessels.","systematic mapping,Internet of Things,Taxonomy,IoT applications,Data analysis,data analysis,storage management,edge computing,taxonomy,maritime applications,vessels,Memory,marine engineering computing,Edge computing,data analyses,Sensors,Time factors,systematic mapping study,data storage,Systematics,"
"combining fm broadcast, accelerometers, ieee 892.15.4 wireless and gps to secure maritime containers worldwide","2010","There are approximately 50 million maritime style containers entering and leaving ports in North America every year and 500 millions worldwide [8]. The interiors of such containers are rarely inspected. With market globalization, a large amount of these containers enter North America on a daily basis. Such containers may include contraband or dangerous items that present an economic or security risk. Despite significant security improvements, only 3 to 5% of the maritime containers, that arrive in or transition through North America, go through physical inspection. Current container tracking technologies solely based on GPS consume high DC power, are costly, require line-of-sight with satellites and they are often too large to be covert. It is possible to overcome some of these limitations by combining GPS with a tracking system based on the FM broadcast signal. Digital FM broadcast is an alternative man-made signal that is ubiquitous, provides a geographically unique frequency spectrum and is about 100,000 as strong as a GPS satellite signal. The combination of GPS and FM, called 'Broadcast Assisted GPSâ„¢' allows the development of a low-cost, low-power and miniature FM-GPS receiver that can trace the path that a container has taken for less than 25$ per container. This paper presents the first results of highway trials (train and sea trials are to be conducted in 2010-2011) of such a low cost, covert, 'Broadcast Assisted GPS'based technology, called 'FM-RFID Tagâ„¢' that records the worldwide displacement of containers and displays the path undertaken by the container while in transit. As an added security benefit, the tag is also capable of detecting container intrusion, either door or side panel intrusion.","accelerometers,container tracking,container intrusion,FM broadcast,Monitoring,Global Positioning System,maritime containers,object tracking,Containers,Noise,IEEE 892.15.4 wireless,Maritime container intrusion sensor and Active RFID,sea ports,USA Councils,containers,GPS,Logic gates,radiofrequency identification,Receivers,Maritime container traceability,tracking system,"
"reinforcement learning-based adaptive pid controller for dps","2020","A conventional PID controller for the DPS has limitations due to fixed gains and dependence on manual adjustment for its gains. Therefore, several previous studies developed a fuzzy-based adaptive PID controller for the DPS which tunes the gains based on the fuzzy logic. However, the fuzzy logic has its disadvantages due to a manual definition of fuzzy rules and fuzzy variables. To overcome those limitations, a deep reinforcement learning algorithm is adopted to learn the efficient adaptive gain-tuning strategy without human intuition behind since it does not require any prior knowledge about the dynamics of a ship or DPS. Finally, it is shown that the proposed system can result in better station-keeping performance without deterioration in its control efficiency.","Proportional-integral-derivative (PID),Dynamic positioning system (DPS),Deep reinforcement learning (DRL),Deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG),Fine-tuning,"
"north american vegetation dynamics observed with multi-resolution satellite data","2008","We investigated normalized difference vegetation index data from the NOAA series of Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometers and found regions in North America that experienced marked increases in annual photosynthetic capacity at various times from 1982 to 2005. Inspection of these anomalous areas with multi-resolution data from Landsat, Ikonos, aerial photography, and ancillary data revealed a range of causes for the NDVI increases: climatic influences; severe drought and subsequent recovery; irrigated agriculture expansion; insect outbreaks followed by logging and subsequent regeneration; and forest fires with subsequent regeneration. Vegetation in areas in the high Northern Latitudes appear to be solely impacted by climatic influences. In other areas examined, the impact of anthropogenic effects is more direct. The pattern of NDVI anomalies over longer time periods appear to be driven by long-term climate change but most appear to be associated with climate variability on decadal and shorter time scales along with direct anthropogenic land cover conversions. The local variability of drivers of change demonstrates the difficulty in interpreting changes in NDVI and indicates the complex nature of changes in the carbon cycle within North America. Coarse scale analysis of changes could well fail to identify the important local scale drivers controlling the carbon cycle and to identify the relative roles of disturbance and climate change. Our results document regional land cover land use change and climatic influences that have altered continental scale vegetation dynamics in North America.","Landsat,NDVI,Climate,Land cover,Vegetation dynamics,AVHRR,"
"a survey of indian ocean region maritime security: technological advancements and innovative solutions","2021","The Indian Ocean Region (IOR) is an important region in the global oceans due to its location and population along with emergence of new world power centers in the form of countries linked with this ocean. Major trade and energy lines pass through this ocean due to which maritime security and stability of the region are very important. To overcome these requirements, traditional as well as innovative solutions are required to be implemented. A paradigm shift is also required to enhance Regional Arrangements for Regional Disaster Response as well as Search and Rescue Operations for which role of technology in improving maritime security cannot be underestimated. This requirement rises from increasing mutual security concerns from states both in the IOR and Asia Pacific region. Technological developments are posing new threats to countries from non-state actors and causing states to mutually cooperate. As a result, emergence of these problems requires regional and global strategies for mutual cooperation. This paper presents an overview of maritime security challenges in the IOR. The role of technological advancement and innovative solutions in improving maritime security in IOR is discussed.

"spatial patterns of landside trade impedance in containerized south american exports","2017","The paper addresses claims implicating higher domestic transportation costs as a significant barrier to Latin America's trade and economic integration - and the region's inadequate transportation infrastructure as the primary cause. The relative “trade space” for U.S.-bound containerized shipments is delineated via reverse spatial interaction modeling. Reconfiguration and reverse calibration of the doubly constrained spatial interaction model is used to derive functional distances between origins and ports of export, as a means of estimating a Trade Impedance Quotient (TIQ) for trade flows at the scale of the continent. Global and local statistics of spatial autocorrelation are then used to analyze the spatial pattern of trade impedance. With this approach, the analysis of containerized flows establishes the existence, extent, location, and spatial distribution of discrepancies in South American landside trade impedance. A large share of trade flows have trade impedance that is disproportionate to distance. Trade impedance at origins is spatially clustered for the total dataset and randomly distributed for commodity segments, and randomly distributed at destinations. Potential focus areas for high trade impedance are identified.","Spatial interaction modeling,South America,Relative space,Trade Impedance Quotient (TIQ),Trade impedance,Spatial autocorrelation,"
"cyber-physical framework for early integration of autonomous maritime capabilities","2013","The increasing demand for more self-governed assistance in maritime activities is leading ocean engineering research projects to combine diverse autonomous capabilities developed at geographically-dispersed locations. Availability of such capabilities as well as experiments in water is a critical issue that can seriously impact on the project milestones. The ability to perform verification and validation at an initial integration stage of maritime capabilities while they are still physically located at the partner's site can reduce significantly costs and risks. This paper proposes an early integration framework for autonomous capabilities of maritime vehicles by means of system and context simulation (including emulation of maritime vehicles and operational environment). This makes interaction between the computational and physical process become crucial as in cyber-physical systems. The framework proposed allows project patterns to pre-verify and pre-validate requirements before the system is physically integrated.

"an identity-based data integrity auditing scheme for cloud-based maritime transportation systems","2023","With the development of Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled Maritime Transportation Systems (MTS), massive data generated in the system not only requires to be stored reliably and cheaply, but also needs to be analyzed timely. The Cloud-based Maritime Transportation Systems (CMTS) allow users to upload the data without worrying about the price, capacity, location and so on. However, CMTS also brings some security issues, where the integrity protection of outsourced data is one of the most important issues since it is crucial for the safety, reliability and efficiency of sea lanes. To solve this problem, we propose an identity-based dynamic data integrity auditing scheme for CMTS. Our scheme decreases the burden of key management and improves the auditing efficiency by batch auditing. Besides, our scheme also supports dynamic operations on the outsourced data for CMTS. The security analysis shows that our scheme can ensure the feature of storage correctness and resist common attacks. In addition, the performance comparison results with other related schemes show that our scheme not only has the lowest computational cost on all entities, but also greatly reduces the communication overhead of the auditing phase. Therefore, our scheme is very suitable for data integrity verification in CMTS.","dynamic operations,Transportation,data integrity,Public key,outsourced data,Internet of Things,transportation,identity-based integrity auditing,reliability,CMTS,related schemes,Cloud-based Maritime Transportation Systems,Servers,batch auditing,Maritime transportation systems,cloud computing,storage management,massive data,outsourcing,data integrity verification,Data integrity,auditing,cloud storage,identity-based data integrity auditing scheme,Cloud computing,Computational modeling,Things-enabled Maritime Transportation Systems,Security,data integration,auditing efficiency,integrity protection,identity-based dynamic data integrity auditing scheme,"

"the application of remote sensing to canadian petroleum exploration: promising and yet unexploited","1986","This paper reviews some of the successful applications of digital remote sensing to petroleum exploration in different parts of the world. They include the updating of existing geologic maps, the location of anomalies related to hydrocarbon seepage, and the integration of the digital imagery into geologic databases to assess hydrocarbon potential on a given scale. Although most of these techniques are useful potentially in the Canadian environment, there seems to be some reticence in this country towards the use of remotely sensed data. Based on discussions with a number of industry and research personnel, an analysis is made of the reasons why Canadian geoscientists have not yet taken advantage of this readily available tool. Some explanations include: (1) the poor resolution of sensors such as the LANDSAT MSS, (2) the till and vegetation overlying parts of the country, and (3) the fact that some areas of the country are so well mapped that it is felt that a system such as LANDSAT could add no relevant information. Conversely, several considerations would seem to favor widespread usage of remotely sensed data in Canada now that the spectral and spatial resolutions of operational sensors are constantly improving. It is possible to map geologic features such as faults from remotely sensed imagery even if they are buried beneath deep till. The vegetation which covers so much of the land surface can provide both structural and geochemical information. There remain large expanses of the country that are relatively unexplored. Finally, considerable expertise exists in Canada in geoscience data integration and image processing, much of it related to mineral-resource work; this expertise may be directed towards petroleum-resource evaluation. Some procedures are recommended for Canadian petroleum geologists in order that they may derive maximum benefits from remotely sensed data.","Petroleum exploration,Image analysis,SPOT-1,Remote sensing,LANDSAT,Canadian petroleum industry,Data integration,"
"collision risk inference system for maritime autonomous surface ships using colregs rules compliant collision avoidance","2021","Maritime autonomous surface ships (MASS) need to be sufficiently safe to gain commercial acceptance. Collision avoidance strategies in such MASS should comply with the International Regulations for Preventing Collision at the Sea (COLREGs). According to the COLREGs, collision risk assessment, which determines the optimal positioning and timing via all available means appropriate to the prevailing circumstances and conditions, is crucial for preventing collisions. However, existing collision risk assessment methods do not consider all vital factors for the COLREGs rules compliant collision avoidance. We propose a collision risk inference system for MASS that complies with COLREGs vital rules for collision avoidance as follows: 1) actions to avoid collision are defined according to the degree of danger, and a suitable response distance is determined; 2) a collision risk index according to the enlarged ship domain based on the designated response distance by each level is set; 3) all vital factors of the COLREGs rules compliant collision avoidance are extracted as the data when the ship domain enlarged by each level is overlapped; 4) the collision risk inference system is developed by learning extracted data via the adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system. In contrast to existing research, the proposed system considers all vital variables in the COLREGs rules compliant collision avoidance guidelines, thereby improving the timings and positionings of the potential collision warning. Consequently, it could secure more time for decision making to take necessary collision prevention action.","marine accidents,existing collision risk assessment methods,Risk management,Preventing Collision,maritime autonomous surface ships,Marine vehicles,fuzzy reasoning,aerospace safety,collision risk index,necessary collision prevention action,Collision avoidance strategies,ships,marine safety,Accidents,Collision avoidance,Shape,risk management,Sea surface,decision making,ship domain,COLREGs vital rules,Adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system,risk analysis,potential collision warning,near-collision accident,COLREGs rules compliant collision avoidance guidelines,COLREGs,collision risk inference system,Navigation,collision avoidance,"

However, only a few studies have analysed the chemical composition of MPs at the Mediterranean Sea surface. In this context, this study aims to describe the chemical composition as a function of particle size, mass and number concentrations of MPs collected in the surface waters of the Mediterranean Sea. The chemical composition showed a certain homogeneity at the Mediterranean Sea scale. The main polymers identified by Fourier Transform Infra-Red (FTIR) spectroscopy were poly(ethylene) (67.3 ± 2.4%), poly(propylene) (20.8 ± 2.1%) and poly(styrene) (3.0 ± 0.9%). Nevertheless, discrepancies, confirmed by the literature, were observed at a mesoscale level. Thus, in the North Tyrrhenian Sea, the proportion of poly(ethylene) was significantly lower than the average value of the Mediterranean Sea (57.9 ± 10.5%). Anthropic sources, rivers, or polymer ageing are assumed to be responsible for the variations observed.","Mediterranean Sea,Poly(ethylene),FTIR,Chemical composition,Microplastics,"
"dbscan algorithm for ais data reconstruction","2021","Automatic Identification System (AIS) is a telecommunication system created to allow ships to communicate with each other by exchanging messages containing information such as vessel’s ID, position, speed, heading, etc. AIS is useful in many cases, such as early ship collision detection. However, its terrestrial segment’s drawback is a relatively low range (about 74 km, roughly 40 nautical miles). Satellite Automatic Identification System (SAT-AIS) was introduced to overcome this limitation, but it suffers from its own problem known as packet collision. The satellite receives messages from multiple terrestrial cells and communication is synchronized within such cells, but not between them, thus messages got lost or damaged when they appear at the satellite at the same time. In this paper, we present a machine learning-based approach to reconstruct those missing messages and deeply investigate whether or not a density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) can be considered in the first stage of the reconstruction. The experiment focuses on findig the optimal parameters for the clustering, running it both on original and damaged data to finally ascertain that DSBCAN can distinguish individual trajectories in a dataset that can be further reconstructed.","clustering,DBSCAN,AIS data analysis,trajectory reconstruction,AIS,"
"characterization of gps and egnos amplitude scintillations over the african equatorial/low-latitude region","2019","This study characterizes GPS and EGNOS amplitude scintillations over the African equatorial/low-latitude region. The data set covers January–December 2013 at three stations; namely, Cape-Verde Island (Lat: 16°N, Lon: 24°W, Mag. Lat: 11°N), Dakar (Lat: 14.75°N, Lon: 17.45°W, Mag. Lat: 5.88°N) [Senegal] and Addis Ababa (Lat: 9.03°N, Lon: 38.77°W, Mag. Lat: 0.18°N) [Ethiopia]. Firstly, we investigated the seasonal variations of scintillations over the study sites. In doing this, we suppressed multipath effects on the data by imposing a 30° elevation masking on the data. Seasonally, scintillations recorded highest occurrences during equinoxes, and the least during June solstice. Secondly, we investigated scintillation occurrences at the three sites on a satellite-by-satellite basis at varying elevation and azimuthal angles. Generally, scintillations (at both low- and high-elevation angles) recorded the highest occurrences at Cape-Verde, followed by Dakar, and the least at Addis Ababa. Scintillation activities were generally localized within the northern skies of the study locations. EGNOS satellites signals scintillated at Dakar and Addis Ababa during the time intervals when GPS satellites signals experienced scintillations. Data showed that Cape-Verde is off the EGNOS geostationary satellite footprint. These results have the potentials of supporting the development of scintillation models for equatorial Africa. Furthermore, with a view to providing robust services for the African user community, the current research effort is also expected to provide value addition to GPS and EGNOS service providers and system designers.","Equatorial,GNSS,Ionospheric scintillation,Africa,Low-latitude,EGNOS,"

"vegetation and climate change, fire-regime shifts and volcanic disturbance in chiloé continental (43°s) during the last 10,000 years","2015","Disentangling the roles of paleofires and explosive volcanism from climatic drivers of past vegetation change is a subject insufficiently addressed in the paleoecological literature. The coastal region of the Chiloé Continental sector of northwestern Patagonia is ideal in this regard considering its proximity to active eruptive centers and the possibility of establishing comparisons with more distal, upwind sites where volcanic influence is minimal. Here we present a fine-resolution pollen and macroscopic charcoal record from Lago Teo with the aim of documenting the local vegetation and climate history, and assessing the role of disturbance regimes as drivers of vegetation change during the last ∼10,000 years. The Lago Teo record shows a conspicuous warm/dry interval between ∼7500 and 10,000 cal yrs BP followed by a cooling trend and increase in precipitation that has persisted until the present, in agreement with previous studies in the region and interpretations of past southern westerly wind activity at multi-millennial scales. The presence of 26 tephras throughout the record allows examination of the relationship between explosive volcanism and vegetation change under contrasting climatic states of the Holocene. We found consistent statistically significant increases in Tepualia stipularis after tephra deposition over the last 10,000 years, in Eucryphia/Caldcluvia between 7500 and 10,000 cal yrs BP and in Hydrangea over the last 7500 years. Our results indicate a primary role of climate change as driver of long-term vegetation change and as a modulator of vegetation responses to volcanic disturbance at multidecadal and centennial timescales.","Northwestern Patagonia,Chiloé Continental,Volcanic disturbance,Temperate rainforest,"

"joint backhaul and access link resource management in maritime communication network","2018","The increasing maritime activities with the exclusive economic zone lead to increasing demands for wideband communications in recent years. This paper presents a maritime communication network architecture where the onshore high-tower base station provides wireless backhaul for the shipborne base stations, while the shipborne base stations serve as the mobile access points for the user ships. Under this architecture, considering the out-of-band full-duplex (OBFD) backhauling mode, we propose a joint backhaul and access link resource management scheme in respect to the wireless backhaul power allocation, access link power allocation and user association, for the sake of maximizing the network capacity. Specially, this scheme takes the inter-cell interference and the multiuser association into account in order to model the realistic maritime communication scenarios. The optimization problem is solved by the successive convex approximation (SCA) method and the numerical simulation results show the effectiveness of the algorithm in terms of the network capacity and the iteration convergence.","wireless backhaul power allocation,multiplexing,access link power allocation,successive convex approximation,intercell interference,convex programming,Marine vehicles,network capacity,shipborne base stations,Resource management,multiuser association,Wireless communication,SCA method,mobile access points,ships,cellular radio,user ships,onshore high-tower base station,OBFD backhauling mode,radiofrequency interference,maritime communication network architecture,out-of-band full-duplex backhauling mode,Optimization,broadband networks,wideband communications,iteration convergence,marine communication,user association,Signal to noise ratio,multi-access systems,Interference,Base stations,resource allocation,access link resource management scheme,"
"an unambiguous imaging method of moving target for maritime scenes with spaceborne high-resolution and wide-swath sar","2022","In azimuth multichannel high-resolution and wide-swath (AMC-HRWS) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) system, undersampling of azimuth signal results in the failure of the single-channel echo imaging, so the echoes of all the channels should be reconstructed to obtain the unambiguous SAR image. Many methods have been proposed to reconstruct the stationary scene echoes. However, moving targets (MTs) will cause false targets in the reconstructed SAR image, which has a great influence on SAR image interpretation and moving target detection, especially in maritime scenes. Hence, we propose an unambiguous imaging method of the moving target for maritime scenes with AMC-HRWS SAR. First, azimuth deramp processing is introduced to obtain coarse-focused moving targets, and then their echoes can be extracted from the sea clutter. Based on the extracted data, a radial velocity estimation method is proposed, which is high efficiency and does not require redundant channels. In addition, based on the estimated radial velocity and the characteristics of the coarse-focused signal, a novel signal reconstruction method of moving target is presented. The reconstruction performance of this method is not affected by channel imbalance, and false targets can be removed even if there is radial velocity error. Besides, the effectiveness of this scheme is verified by the simulation data and GaoFen-3 SAR real data. The estimated radial velocities of ships are verified by automatic identification system (AIS) information. The imaging results show that false targets are effectively suppressed, and moving targets are located in correct positions.","moving target detection,GaoFen-3 SAR real data,stationary scene echoes,SAR image interpretation,Image reconstruction,image resolution,azimuth multichannel high-resolution,image sampling,wide-swath SAR,single-channel echo imaging,Synthetic aperture radar,Signal reconstruction,high-resolution and wide-swath (HRWS),AMC-HRWS SAR,false targets,object detection,synthetic aperture radar,radial velocity estimation method,signal reconstruction,unambiguous imaging method,image reconstruction,radar imaging,Doppler effect,moving target (MT) signal reconstruction,novel signal reconstruction method,radial velocity estimation,maritime scenes,Azimuth,spaceborne high-resolution,unambiguous SAR image,Imaging,maritime scene,Estimation,synthetic aperture radar (SAR),reconstructed SAR image,Azimuth multichannel (AMC),"
"oxygen isotope composition of diatoms as late holocene climate proxy at two-yurts lake, central kamchatka, russia","2015","Especially in combination with other proxies, the oxygen isotope composition of diatom silica (δ18Odiatom) from lake sediments is useful for interpreting past climate conditions. This paper presents the first oxygen isotope data of fossil diatoms from Kamchatka, Russia, derived from sediment cores from Two-Yurts Lake (TYL). For reconstructing Late Holocene climate change, palaeolimnological investigations also included diatom, pollen and chironomid analysis. The most recent diatom sample (δ18Odiatom=+23.3‰) corresponds well with the present day isotopic composition of the TYL water (mean δ18O=−14.8‰) displaying a reasonable isotope fractionation in the system silica-water. Nonetheless, the TYL δ18Odiatom record is mainly controlled by changes in the isotopic composition of the lake water. TYL is considered as a dynamic system triggered by differential environmental changes closely linked with lake-internal hydrological factors. The diatom silica isotope record displays large variations in δ18Odiatom from +27.3‰ to +23.3‰ from about ~4.5kyr BP until today. A continuous depletion in δ18Odiatom of 4.0‰ is observed in the past 4.5kyr, which is in good accordance with other hemispheric environmental changes (i.e. a summer insolation-driven Mid- to Late Holocene cooling). The overall cooling trend is superimposed by regional hydrological and atmospheric–oceanic changes. These are related to the interplay between Siberian High and Aleutian Low as well as to the ice dynamics in the Sea of Okhotsk. Additionally, combined δ18Odiatom and chironomid interpretations provide new information on changes related to meltwater input to lakes. Hence, this diatom isotope study provides further insight into hydrology and climate dynamics of this remote, rarely investigated area.","Palaeoclimate,Aleutian Low,Palaeolimnology,Diatom oxygen isotopes,Holocene,Biogenic silica,"

"changes in the supply of eastern mediterranean glasses to visigothic spain","2019","This study presents the first comprehensive analysis of glass compositions from Visigothic Spain using high resolution laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS). Major, minor and trace element patterns of 169 well-dated samples from three rural Iberian sites (Congosto, Gózquez and El Pelícano) have brought to light major chronological developments in the production, circulation and use of glass between the fifth and the eighth century CE. The data identify four distinct compositional groups of Egyptian and Levantine origin. Egyptian Foy 2.1, Foy 2.1 high Fe and so-called Magby alongside Apollonia-type Levantine I were the main glass types of the Visigothic period. Due to the tight dating of the majority of the samples, we were able to reveal fundamental changes in the geographical scope of glass supplies to the Iberian Peninsula, and to refine the chronological range of the known primary production groups. The glass group commonly known as série 2.1 or Foy 2.1 started being produced already during the second half of the fifth century. The appearance of Foy 2.1 high Fe can likewise be moved forward to the first half of the sixth century. A plant-ash group referred to as Magby was introduced around the middle of the sixth century. Egypt was undeniably the main supplier of raw glasses to the Iberian Peninsula up to the mid-sixth century CE, after which the Levantine I group became the prime glass type among the analysed assemblages. In the final stages of the Visigothic Kingdom and the early years of Islamic dominion, there is a noticeable drop in the absolute quantity of glass available, together with an increase in recycling. The implications of these transformations in the supply of glass for the organisation of Mediterranean trade are discussed.","Levantine I,Foy 2.1,Recycling,Foy 2.1 high Fe,Magby,Foy 2.2,LA-ICP-MS,"
"bromine:lead ratios in airborne particles from urban and rural sites","1986","Air particulate samples were collected from one urban and two rural sites in NW England. Regression of Br and Pb showed the elements to be virtually uniquely associated at all sites, but with a lower ratio of BrPb in the town (0.25 ± 0.01) than at the rural sites (0.30 ± 0.01 and 0.33 ± 0.02). All the BrPb ratios were below that assumed to characterize fresh exhaust (0.386) and it is suggested that this is due not only to loss of Br, but more substantially to the collection of either resuspended street dust or re-entrained exhaust deposit emissions. Evidence for this was found in size-fractionated samples, for which fine fraction BrPb ratios near 0.386 were measured, both at urban and rural sites. Further evidence came from studies of the lead speciation. In contrast, a second urban site, at Ellesmere Port, showed evidence for Br loss in measurements of gaseous and particulate Br, which may be attributed to a different atmospheric composition at this site.","lead,ratios,exhaust emissions,Bromine,"
"a spatiotemporal clustering approach to maritime domain awareness","2013","Spatiotemporal clustering is the process of grouping objects based on both their spatial and temporal similarity. This approach is useful when considering the distance between objects and how that distance changes through time. Spatiotemporal clustering analysis is applied to the maritime domain in this paper, specifically to a defined area of water, during a period of time, in order to gain behavioral knowledge of vessel interactions and provide the opportunity to screen such interactions for further investigation. The proposed spatiotemporal clustering algorithm spatially clusters vessels in the water space using k-means clustering analysis, kinematically refines the clusters based on the similarity of vessel headings, speeds and the distance between them, and temporally analyzes the continuity of membership of the kinematic clusters through time to determine which clusters are moving. The algorithm is implemented in the MATLAB programming environment, verified with a synthetic data scenario, and validated with two real-world datasets.","Kinematics,spatiotemporal clustering algorithm,Clustering algorithms,Spatiotemporal phenomena,Spatiotemporal clustering,maritime domain awareness,Global Positioning System,MATLAB programming,Filtering,marine safety,maritime domain,vessel headings,vessel interaction,water space,marine communication,Visualization,Algorithm design and analysis,k-means clustering analysis,vessel speeds,Arrays,"
"optimal offloading of computing-intensive tasks for edge-aided maritime uav systems","2022","This paper considers the autonomous detecting and tracking task of the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in the maritime environment. In the maritime UAV tracking system, due to the large size of the image computing-task and the shortage of UAV batteries and computational capability, the UAV needs to offload the computing-intensive task to the edge computing server (ECS) to reduce energy consumption and task latency. However, the task latency is still too long for the UAV tracking algorithm due to the large image size. We research the impact of image resolution on the computing task size and detection accuracy, and formulate an edge-aided UAV system with dynamic image resolution. With the constraint on task latency, we jointly optimize the image resolution, offloading rate, transmission power and local central processing unit (CPU) frequency to minimize energy consumption. Although the proposed problem is non-convex, we transform it into a convex optimization problem through decoupling and problem decomposition, and obtain an optimal offloading strategy. The numerical results show the energy efficiency of the proposed strategy by comparing it with the local first offloading strategy and the edge first offloading strategy.","Image edge detection,autonomous detecting,image resolution,Energy consumption,Vehicular and wireless technologies,edge computing server,image size,unmanned aerial vehicle,Target tracking,optimisation,edge computing,tracking task,convex optimization problem,UAV batteries,offload,visual target tracking,Autonomous aerial vehicles,power aware computing,computational capability,optimal offloading strategy,edge-aided maritime UAV systems,computing task size,autonomous aerial vehicles,marine engineering computing,dynamic image resolution,maritime environment,energy consumption,Image resolution,energy conservation,computing-intensive task,Transforms,UAV tracking algorithm,UAV,edge-aided UAV system,image computing-task,"
"a dual linear autoencoder approach for vessel trajectory prediction using historical ais data","2020","Advances in artificial intelligence are driving the development of intelligent transportation systems, with the purpose of enhancing the safety and efficiency of such systems. One of the most important aspects of maritime safety is effective collision avoidance. In this study, a novel dual linear autoencoder approach is suggested to predict the future trajectory of a selected vessel. Such predictions can serve as a decision support tool to evaluate the future risk of ship collisions. Inspired by generative models, the method suggests to predict the future trajectory of a vessel based on historical AIS data. Using unsupervised learning to facilitate trajectory clustering and classification, the method utilizes a cluster of historical AIS trajectories to predict the trajectory of a selected vessel. Similar methods predict future states iteratively, where states are dependent upon the prior predictions. The method in this study, however, suggests predicting an entire trajectory, where all states are predicted jointly. Further, the method estimates a latent distribution of the possible future trajectories of the selected vessel. By sampling from this distribution, multiple trajectories are predicted. The uncertainties of the predicted vessel positions are also quantified in this study.","Collision avoidance,Autoencoder,Trajectory prediction,AIS,Machine learning,Maritime situation awareness,"

"on-demand mec empowered uav deployment for 6g time-sensitive maritime internet of things","2021","With the emergence of sixth-generation (6G) mobile communication technologies, intelligent gadgets are expanding. Meanwhile, due to the fast rise of marine operations for trade, research, military, oil drilling, and recreational activities, the number of maritime internet-of-things (MIoT) devices is also expanding. On-demand deployment of multiaccess edge computing (MEC) empowered unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to meet the network coverage demand for MIoT devices at the seaside is presented. The MEC-UAVs are considered as reliable, cost-effective, and efficient for deployment and service provision to MIoT devices. The network profit maximization on MEC-UAV deployment and effective service allocation to MIoT devices is investigated. A combinatorial optimization problem as an integer linear programming (ILP) is formulated, which is NP-hard. To deal with a complex problem, we propose a Bender decomposition (BD) algorithm. The BD decomposes the ILP into the master problem for MEC-UAVs deployment and subproblem for MIoT device association.

"sediment geochemistry in coastal maritime antarctica (admiralty bay, king george island): evidence from rare earths and other elements","2007","We report the concentrations of 22 elements in short coastal sediment cores of Admiralty Bay (King George Island, Antarctica) determined by Neutron Activation Analysis. We focus the discussion on rare earth elements (REE) because their fractionation patterns in sediments relative to local sources may offer insights about weathering, transportation, deposition, and diagenetic processes. We found strong correlations between REE and Th, indicating detrital origin. Despite strong Eh gradients, the Th-normalized redox-sensitive elements (e.g., Eu, Ce, Fe, As, and others) showed little variability within the sedimentary environment. The exceptions were U (depleted in the upper few centimeters) and Br (enriched in the upper few centimeters). While U appears to be removed from seawater via uptake across the boundary of reducing sediments, the mechanisms driving Br accumulation are unclear, but perhaps related to increasing diatom production driven by regional warming. A comparison with published concentrations from rocks representing the regional eroding units showed that the characteristics of source rock could be recognized in the REE fractionation patterns in our sediments. These results imply no significant alteration during weathering and sediment transport in the coastal region of Admiralty Bay and the prevalence of strong periglacial erosion in ice-free areas of maritime Antarctica in spite of the relatively mild regional environmental setting (e.g., high moisture and high temperatures).","Heavy metal,Diagenesis,REE,NAA,Bromine,Sediment,Antarctica,Weathering,Coastal environment,"

"observing and understanding the southeast asian aerosol system by remote sensing: an initial review and analysis for the seven southeast asian studies (7seas) program","2013","Southeast Asia (SEA) hosts one of the most complex aerosol systems in the world, with convoluted meteorological scales, sharp geographic and socioeconomic features, high biological productivity, mixtures of a wide range of atmospheric pollutants, and likely a significant susceptibility to global climate change. This physical complexity of SEA is coupled with one of the world's most challenging environments for both in situ and remote sensing observation. The 7-Southeast Asian Studies (7SEAS) program was formed to facilitate interdisciplinary research into the integrated SEA aerosol environment via grass roots style collaboration. In support of the early 7SEAS program and the affiliated Southeast Asia Composition, Cloud, Climate Coupling Regional Study (SEAC4RS), this review was created to outline the network of connections linking aerosol particles in SEA with meteorology, climate and the total earth system. In this review, we focus on and repeatedly link back to our primary data source: satellite aerosol remote sensing and associated observability issues. We begin with a brief rationale for the program, outlining key aerosol impacts and, comparing their magnitudes to the relative uncertainty of observations. We then discuss aspects of SEA's physical, socio-economic and biological geography relevant to meteorology and observability issues associated with clouds and precipitation. We show that not only does SEA pose significant observability challenges for aerosol particles, but for clouds and precipitation as well. With the fundamentals of the environment outlined, we explore SEA's most studied aerosol issue: biomass burning. We summarize research on bulk aerosol properties for SEA, including a short synopsis of recent AERONET observations. We describe long range transport patterns. Finally, considerable attention is paid to satellite aerosol observability issues, with a face value comparison of common aerosol products in the region including passive and active aerosol products as well as fluxes. We show that satellite data products diverge greatly due to a host of known artifacts. These artifacts have important implications for how research is conducted, and care must be taken when using satellite products to study aerosol problems. The paper ends with a discussion of how the community can approach this complex and important environment.","Southeast Asia,Air Pollution,Biomass Burning,Aerosol,Meteorology,Remote Sensing,Maritime Continent,"

"imposex and organotin prevalence in a european post-legislative scenario: temporal trends from 2003 to 2008","2009","Imposex levels and organotin tissue concentrations were assessed in Nassarius reticulatus females collected between June and August 2008 at 23 sites along the Portuguese coast. Females with imposex were present at all sampling sites with highest levels inside main harbors. Imposex parameters across sampling stations varied between 6.3% and 100% for %I, 0.2–4.4 for VDSI, 0.1–7.8mm for FPL, 0.3–88.9% for RPLI and 0.0–1.1 for AOS. TBT levels varied between 3.5 and 380ngSng−1 dw, representing an average proportion of 50.4% of total butyltins (∑BTs=MBT+DBT+TBT). Sterile females were detected at two locations. Highly significant correlations between imposex and TBT levels were found. The efficacy of the EU legislation banning the use of TBT-based antifouling paints since 2003 (EC Regulation 782/2003) was evaluated by comparing the levels of imposex observed in 2008 with those reported for 2003. OTs tissue concentrations were also determined in preserved samples collected in 2003. There was a decrease in imposex and TBT tissue contamination between 2003 and 2008 indicating that a decline in TBT pollution has occurred in the Portuguese coast since the implementation of the legislation. Considering that the EC Regulation 782/2003 is an anticipation of the IMO AFS Convention, a global scale decrease in TBT pollution can be expected in the near future. Despite the rapid amelioration in the Portuguese coast, TBT pollution is still a problem as the Ecological Quality Objective (EcoQO) proposed by OSPAR Commission was not achieved in 91% of the surveyed sites.","Portuguese coast,EC Regulation 782/2003,Sterility,Tributyltin,"
"dent damage identification in stiffened cylindrical structures using inverse finite element method","2020","The offshore industry has been using stiffened thin-walled steel cylindrical structures for decades, particularly as the columns of floating offshore installations. The floating offshore installations may be subjected to severe marine environmental conditions. Accidents such as collisions may also occur. Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) is a viable tool to maintain safe operation of offshore installations. Inverse Finite Element Method (iFEM) is one of the most powerful methods for SHM process. Hence, this study focuses on the application of iFEM methodology to thin-walled cylindrical structures representing the columns of floating offshore installations. iFEM methodology is verified by comparing its displacement results against reference finite element method (FEM) solution. After this verification, four different damage cases with different size, location and number of damages are considered. By using a newly introduced damage parameter and von Mises strain distribution iFEM accurately identified the correct damage locations and sizes. Therefore, it is concluded that iFEM can be used for structural damage prediction in offshore structures with high accuracy even if the number of the strain sensors is limited.","Structural health monitoring,Floating offshore installations,Stiffened cylinder,Inverse finite element method,"

The review discusses air quality, in terms of emissions, processing and transport of trace gases and aerosols. New insights into the characterization of both natural and anthropogenic emissions are reviewed looking at both natural (e.g. dust and lightning) as well as plant emissions. Trends in anthropogenic emissions both by region and globally are discussed as well as biomass burning emissions. In terms of chemical processing the major air quality elements of ozone, non-methane hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides and aerosols are covered. A number of topics are presented as a way of integrating the process view into the atmospheric context; these include the atmospheric oxidation efficiency, halogen and HOx chemistry, nighttime chemistry, tropical chemistry, heat waves, megacities, biomass burning and the regional hot spot of the Mediterranean. New findings with respect to the transport of pollutants across the scales are discussed, in particular the move to quantify the impact of long-range transport on regional air quality. Gaps and research questions that remain intractable are identified. The review concludes with a focus of research and policy questions for the coming decade.

"synergistic abiotic and biotic stressors explain widespread decline of pinus pinaster in a mixed forest","2019","Global change potentially increases forest vulnerability. Different abiotic and biotic factors may interact to cause forest decline and accelerated tree mortality. We studied a mixed Mediterranean continental forest where Pinus pinaster Ait. (maritime pine) shows widespread decline to analyse the role of different abiotic and biotic factors on health status and growth dynamics both at the individual and plot levels. We also analysed stand composition and regeneration of tree species to check whether there is a change in species dominance. Fungal pathogens were seldom present and we detected no pervasive fungi or insect infestation and no presence of pathogens like Heterobasidion or Phytophthora. Infection of hemiparasite plants like Viscum album L. (mistletoe) can reduce leaf area and its abundance is generally considered an expression of host decline. Yet, the existence among declining trees of high defoliation levels without mistletoe, but not vice versa, suggests that defoliation in response to some abiotic stressor could be a predisposing factor preceding mistletoe infection. Compared to healthy trees, declining and dead trees exhibited higher defoliation rates, smaller needles and lower recent growth with steeper negative trends. Dead and declining trees showed similar negative growth trends since the early 1990s droughts, which we interpreted as early warning signals anticipating mortality of currently declining trees in the near future. Mortality of maritime pine extending across all size classes, the lower presence of this species in the smallest size classes and its lack of regeneration suggest it is potentially losing its current dominance and being replaced by other co-occurring, more drought-tolerant species. Our results unravelled that maritime pine decline seems to be mainly driven by a combination of predisposing and inciting abiotic factors (microenvironment and drought stress) and biotic factors (mistletoe). The absence of widespread fungal pathogens suggests that they may have a minor role on pine decline acting only eventually as contributing factors. Although there could be other interrelations among factors or other biotic agents at play, our results strongly suggest that water stress plays a major role in the decline process of the dominant species on an ecosystem with strong land-use legacies.","Abiotic stress,Mistletoe,Defoliation,Drought,Land-use,Fungal pathogens,"
"chapter 2 - secrets of bermuda triangle and formation of polymetallic nodules","2017","This chapter addresses two different awe-inspiring aspects primarily concerning the abyssal depths of the oceans; one (the Bermuda Triangle imbroglio) that is specific to the Atlantic Ocean, and the other (formation of polymetallic nodules (PMN)) that is common to the Pacific, Indian, and the Atlantic Oceans. The chapter begins with a brief general introduction, touching on both these diverse aspects. To meaningfully introduce the topic of the Bermuda Triangle imbroglio, some related aspects, such as the historical episode of fire breakout in the Japan Sea, and the trawler wreck in Witch’s Hole pockmark have been described. Subsequent discussion focus on other related aspects, including methane hydrate deposits in the seafloor sediment layer and their role in the Bermuda Triangle imbroglio, as well as the possible influence of the warm Gulf Stream in triggering methane gas emission, which, based on scientific evidence, is suspected to be the culprit in the sudden disappearances of ships and low-flying aircraft in the Bermuda Triangle region. The discussion is strengthened by invoking various scientific studies carried out to unlock the secret behind this dreaded story. The second part of this chapter addresses another interesting aspect of the ocean floor, namely, the carpet of “dark gold” (PMN) having been paved over by nature over a period of billions of years’ utterly slow growth (at the rate of 1–3mm/million years). The chapter attaches due importance to the devices used for collection of the dark gold from the abyssal ocean depths (paved on the ocean floor, as well as buried in thick sediments lying below the ocean floor’s water-sediment interface). Subsequent discussion on the dark nodules revolves around important aspects, such as their specialty and structure, factors influencing their formation, the role of nucleating materials, their shape and surface texture, internal features (thickness of oxide layer, internal microstructure), chemical composition, role of micro-organisms in their formation, and presence of rare earth elements. The chapter winds up with a discussion on the distribution of nodules in the world oceans.","Nucleus,Gas hydrates,Microstructure,Bermuda Triangle,Ocean basin,Pockmarks,Polymetallic nodules,Chemical composition,Todorokite,Fire,"
"from safety to security - pattern and anomaly detections in maritime trajectories","2015","This paper presents recent findings in maritime trajectory pattern and anomaly detection using long-term data collected via a shore-based network of Automatic Identification System (AIS).

The project themes include safety and efficiency in marine transportation, as well as environment issues.

"container port performance measurement and comparison leveraging ship gps traces and maritime open data","2016","Container ports are generally measured and compared using performance indicators such as container throughput and facility productivity. Being able to measure the performance of container ports quantitatively is of great importance for researchers to design models for port operation and container logistics. Instead of relying on the manually collected statistical information from different port authorities and shipping companies, we propose to leverage the pervasive ship GPS traces and maritime open data to derive port performance indicators, including ship traffic, container throughput, berth utilization, and terminal productivity. These performance indicators are found to be directly related to the number of container ships arriving at the terminals and the number of containers handled at each ship. Therefore, we propose a framework that takes the ships' container-handling events at terminals as the basis for port performance measurement. With the inferred port performance indicators, we further compare the strengths and weaknesses of different container ports at the terminal level, port level, and region level, which can potentially benefit terminal productivity improvement, liner schedule optimization, and regional economic development planning. In order to evaluate the proposed framework, we conduct extensive studies on large-scale real-world GPS traces of container ships collected from major container ports worldwide through the year, as well as various maritime open data sources concerning ships and ports. Evaluation results confirm that the proposed framework not only can accurately estimate various port performance indicators but also effectively produces port comparison results such as port performance ranking and port region comparison.","open data,Productivity,container throughput,Ports (Computers),Throughput,regional economic development planning,performance indicators,liner schedule optimization,GPS traces,Marine vehicles,urban computing,Global Positioning System,port authorities,scheduling,port operation,terminal productivity improvement,statistical analysis,ships,Containers,shipping companies,container port performance measurement,marine engineering,berth utilization,container logistics,optimisation,Measurement,sea ports,comparison leveraging ship,maritime open data sources,logistics data processing,ship traffic,Container port,intelligent transportation system (ITS),statistical information,GPS trace,productivity,"
"the last interglacial ocean","1984","The final effort of the CLIMAP project was a study of the last interglaciation, a time of minimum ice volume some 122,000 yr ago coincident with the Substage 5e oxygen isotopic minimum. Based on detailed oxygen isotope analyses and biotic census counts in 52 cores across the world ocean, last interglacial sea-surface temperatures (SST) were compared with those today. There are small SST departures in the mid-latitude North Atlantic (warmer) and the Gulf of Mexico (cooler). The eastern boundary currents of the South Atlantic and Pacific oceans are marked by large SST anomalies in individual cores, but their interpretations are precluded by no-analog problems and by discordancies among estimates from different biotic groups. In general, the last interglacial ocean was not significantly different from the modern ocean. The relative sequencing of ice decay versus oceanic warming on the Stage 6/5 oxygen isotopic transition and of ice growth versus oceanic cooling on the Stage 5e/5d transition was also studied. In most of the Southern Hemisphere, the oceanic response marked by the biotic census counts preceded (led) the global ice-volume response marked by the oxygen-isotope signal by several thousand years. The reverse pattern is evident in the North Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico, where the oceanic response lagged that of global ice volume by several thousand years. As a result, the very warm temperatures associated with the last interglaciation were regionally diachronous by several thousand years. These regional lead-lag relationships agree with those observed on other transitions and in long-term phase relationships; they cannot be explained simply as artifacts of bioturbational translations of the original signals.",""
"joint tracking and classification for extended targets in maritime surveillance","2018","In the framework of target tracking, joint tracking and classification (JTC) based approaches have been recently introduced to adjust the trajectory estimation to a given type of target. In a maritime surveillance framework, these approaches leverage marine radar capabilities to provide high resolution measurements. It can then be helpful to choose relevant motion models regarding the tracking algorithm. Among them, the authors recently proposed to take advantage of the target extent measurements for single or multiple-target tracking. This work was based on a point source hypothesis regarding the position measurement of each target. However, this is no longer suitable for extended target tracking. An extension of our previous work to track properly extended targets whose position measurement can be obtained from any point source of its surface is thus proposed. For this purpose, random matrix theory is leveraged. Eventually, the relevance of the proposed approach with simulated data is analyzed.","high resolution measurements,position measurement,Position measurement,marine radar,Bayesian estimation,image resolution,image motion analysis,matrix algebra,trajectory estimation,maritime surveillance framework,Radar measurements,random matrix theory,multiple-target tracking,target tracking,tracking algorithm,joint tracking and classification,Target tracking,extended target tracking,image classification,search radar,Radar tracking,radar imaging,random matrix,radar tracking,target extent measurements,Surveillance,motion models,Joint tracking and classification,target classification,marine radar capabilities,target extent,"
"a voyage-based cooperative resource allocation scheme in maritime broadband access network","2017","Increasing marine activities taking place within the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) have made broadband maritime communications very attractive in recent years. In this paper, a coordinated satellite and terrestrial (II-CST) architecture is presented to enable real-time and broadband Internet access within the EEZ. Further, a voyage-based resource allocation scheme is proposed to dynamically adapt the system resource consumption corresponding with the user load. We make switching plans for shipborne base stations (S-BSs) considering the proportion of blocked users and changes in user distribution to recover broadband access and reduce inter-cell interference at sea, and take the sailing position of accessed users as a constraint to cooperatively adjust the downlink power of S-BSs. Simulation results under real ship data of China's Yellow Sea show that under the II-CST architecture, our resource allocation scheme can effectively improve the signal to interference noise ratio (SINR) of users, reduce the number of handover-related link failures, and reduce the power consumption of S-BSs.","Satellites,mobility management (mobile radio),user distribution,intercell interference,Marine vehicles,handover-related link failures,Switches,shipborne base stations,Resource management,interference suppression,blocked users,satellite communication,ships,Yellow Sea,broadband maritime communications,cellular radio,terrestrial architecture,Broadband communication,voyage-based cooperative resource allocation scheme,EEZ,marine activities,radiofrequency interference,Real-time systems,system resource consumption,broadband networks,cooperative communication,II-CST architecture,marine communication,maritime broadband access network,S-BS,coordinated satellite and terrestrial architecture,multi-access systems,Interference,exclusive economic zone,resource allocation,user load,China,power consumption,"
"controls on rainfall variability in the tropical south pacific for the last 350 years reconstructed from oxygen isotopes in stalagmites from the cook islands","2022","The hydroclimate of the South Pacific is highly variable on a range of timescales, however, the brevity of instrumental data in the region complicates the detection and attribution of this variability. Annually laminated speleothems may fill this knowledge gap by providing paleo-hydroclimate proxy data extending beyond the instrumental period. In this study, replicated oxygen isotope (δ18O) time series from two stalagmites from Pouatea (Pu17) and Nurau (Nu16) caves in the southern Cook Islands were used to reconstruct the variability of effective infiltration over the past 350 years (1672–2019 CE) based on observational rainfall data and cave monitoring and calcite farming experiments. The reconstructed infiltration was then compared to available reconstructions of known climate drivers of the South Pacific. Significant dry and wet periods over the last 350 years were identified based on the δ18O signal of compact/porous calcite fabric and their δ13C signals. The hydroclimate significance of these proxies was validated through comparison with the instrumental records. We could not reach an annual resolution of reconstructed infiltration, due to a combination of stable isotope sampling limitations and mixing effects within the aquifer. Nevertheless, the combined δ18O record of Pu17 and Nu16 identifies that the main driver of infiltration and, hence rainfall variability, in the southern Cook Islands is the location of the South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ), which in turn is modulated by the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO). This study demonstrates the hydroclimate significance of speleothem fabrics when combined with O and C stable isotopes, and adds paleoclimate information to a region that has a paucity of data.","ENSO,Stalagmites,Rainfall,SPCZ,Paleoclimate,δO,"
"submarine groundwater discharge detection through remote sensing: an application of landsat 7 and 8 in hawaiʻi and ireland","2022","Submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) represents an important component of the global water cycle. Improved assessment of SGD occurrences provides information to constrain current estimates of total freshwater discharges, which are crucial for evaluation of changes in the global water cycle. This study leverages SGD linkages to patterns in sea surface temperature (SST) and color. Typically, groundwater temperatures exhibit less variability than SST and tend to have temperature distinct from sea water. Consequently, thermally anomalous plumes often occur in coastal areas with SGD. Nutrient-enriched groundwater flows have been linked to changes in ocean color as a consequence of algae growth and of the presence of colored dissolved organic matter. Under such conditions, SGD presence may also manifest as plumes of different colors. Changes in SST and color can be captured through satellite imagery for the thermal infrared and visible bands, which are used here to detect potential SGD (PSGD) occurrences. A method based on clustering and spectroscopy techniques is applied to automatically detect PSGD plumes. SST data are clustered to map SST anomalies. Derivative analysis and angular distance are applied to identify a color signature linked to SGD. In a novel approach, SST and color are combined to identify PSGD through remote sensing. The methods presented in this study were applied to Landsat 7 and 8 imagery captured over southern Ireland and the west coast of the Island of Hawaiʻi, where past field surveys of radon isotopes activities and salinity have documented SGD occurrences. These selected sites are used as validation points. Derivative analysis and angular distance resulted in PSGD plumes in the vicinity of sampled locations, mainly locations with samples that are strong indicators of SGD. In general, the PSGD plumes derived from each method are compared as independent, parallel lines of evidence of PSGD occurrences. Results also show that PSGD pixels from derivative analysis and angular distance alone, without considering SST, can be obfuscated by confounding factors, such as low tides and unrelated chlorophyll enrichment, and that combining SST and color data reduces those effects. These results provide further evidence for PSGD occurrences along the south coast of Ireland and the west coast of the Island of Hawaiʻi, and showcase that satellite data can be used to better identify the location of PSGD occurrences over large areas.","Coastal waters,Submarine groundwater discharge,Ocean color,Sea surface temperature,"
"nmtlat: a new robust mobile multi-target localization and tracking scheme in marine search and rescue wireless sensor networks under byzantine attack","2020","After a shipwreck (ship collision, explosion, disappearance, etc.), people rely on the marine search and rescue wireless sensor networks (MSR-WSNs) as one key weapon to locate and track drowning targets to save lives and assets. However, due to the complex and dynamic ocean environment, marine sensors could be captured by malicious attackers and then become Byzantine sensors. Byzantine sensors may tamper with the actual sensor data at a fixed or time-varying probability and transmit it to the data fusion center (DFC), which renders the normal localization and tracking function of the search and rescue system downgrade or even fail. To address this issue, we develop a New robust marine mobile Multi-Target LocAlization and Tracking scheme called NMTLAT by eliminating abnormal measurement data from the initial measurement data. NMTLAT works in several steps. By analyzing and mining sensors data and behavior, we firstly employ the information entropy of the system composed of a single sensor and their neighbor sensors to develop an efficient dynamic threshold based Byzantine node identification method. After migrating Byzantine sensors, the DFC utilizes sensor-aware and preprocessed marine data of the beacon or honest sensors to complete target localization and trajectory tracking. Specifically, NMTLAT consists of a novel distributed and cooperative multi-target localization and tracking algorithm using both received signal strength indication (RSSI) and priori information of sensors location. NMTLAT employs the importance sampling method to approximate the posterior probability distribution of the sensors and targets location. Furthermore, when the marine target is outside MSR-WSNs coverage, a piecewise function is utilized to characterize the likelihood of finding a drowning target in the search and rescue sea area. Finally, the Lyapunov’s second stability theorem is adopted to measure the stability of the NMTLAT. Our extensive simulation experiments validate that the NMTLAT performance is superior to existing solutions in various marine search and rescue scenarios.","Importance sampling,Lyapunov’s stability theorem,Information entropy,Maritime search and rescue wireless sensor networks,Cooperative localization and tracking,Byzantine sensor identification,"
"business model development towards service management 4.0","2016","There is an increasing interest to ensure operational and maintenance (O&M) operations from a strategic perspective, and there are opportunities for both producing companies and service providers to gain benefits. Research shows that the combined business models (products combined with services) have a positive effect on the business. Likewise, it is profitable to think strategically and in long term for enterprises offering maintenance services, especially using performance-based models. But for achieving these benefits the view of the business has to change. The focus should be on the values created and not in the offers in form of products or services. Moreover, the company needs to position itself as an actor not only in the value chain, but in a wider context referred to as the business ecosystem. Making such a shift of focus is hard though, and there is a need to understand both the current state of the business as well as the potential future directions. The framework presented in this paper is an attempt to meet these needs. The framework describes business model development in four levels. From maturity point of view, the four steps could be seen as the logical development of the business model from a narrow technical perspective to a holistic product-service perspective. The four levels could also be connected to the industrial development where level four supports Industry 4.0. Level four is referred to as Service Management 4.0. In particular, four key concepts reflect the concept of Service Management 4.0: the mix of products and services in customer offers, performance-based contracts, partnering and the business ecology concept.","Integrated product-service models,Business model development,Service management 4.0,"
"similarity grouping-guided neural network modeling for maritime time series prediction","2019","Reliable and accurate prediction of time series plays a crucial role in the maritime industry, such as economic investment, transportation planning, port planning, design, and so on. The dynamic growth of maritime time series has the predominantly complex, and nonlinear and non-stationary properties. To guarantee high-quality prediction performance, we propose to first adopt the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and ensemble EMD (EEMD) methods to decompose the original time series into high- and low-frequency components. The low-frequency components can be easily predicted directly through traditional neural network (NN) methods. It is more difficult to predict high-frequency components due to their properties of weak mathematical regularity. To take advantage of the inherent self-similarities within high-frequency components, these components will be divided into several continuous small (overlapping) segments. The grouped segments with high similarities are then selected to form more proper training datasets for traditional NN methods. This regrouping strategy can assist in enhancing the prediction accuracy of high-frequency components. The final prediction result is obtained by integrating the predicted high- and low-frequency components. Our proposed three-step prediction frameworks benefit from the time series decomposition and similar segments grouping. The experiments on both port cargo throughput and vessel traffic flow have illustrated its superior performance in terms of prediction accuracy and robustness.","predicted high- frequency components,Transportation,Data prediction,time series decomposition,high-frequency components,nonstationary properties,Planning,reliable prediction,Predictive models,original time series,dynamic time warping (DTW),neural nets,low-frequency components,high-quality prediction performance,marine engineering,Artificial neural networks,similar segments grouping,Time series analysis,similarity grouping,similarity grouping-guided neural network modeling,three-step prediction frameworks,empirical mode decomposition (EMD),time series,Training,prediction accuracy,NN methods,maritime industry,maritime time series prediction,neural network,neural network methods,EMD methods,"
"the resilience and sensitivity of northeast atlantic deep water εnd to overprinting by detrital fluxes over the past 30,000 years","2019","The neodymium isotope proxy has become a valuable tool for the reconstruction of past ocean water mass provenance and mixing. For its accurate application, knowledge about the origin and preservation of Nd in sedimentary archives is crucial. Recently, concerns have emerged regarding the applicability of neodymium isotopes as a conservative palaeo water mass tracer, given potential Nd fluxes from sediments into bottom waters (Abbott et al., 2015a) and inferred relabelling of ocean waters by settling detrital material (Roberts and Piotrowski, 2015). Consequently, a decoupling of water mass provenance and proxy variations may arise. We investigate the mobility of Nd around extreme detrital sedimentation events such as glacial ice rafting pulses and turbidite deposition in the Northeast Atlantic. The constructed records from sediment leachates span extreme Nd isotope variations including volcanic (εNd ∼ 0) and Laurentian (εNd ∼ −27) sources. We find that Nd was released into pore waters from reactive detritus inside some detrital layers during early diagenesis, thereby overprinting any archived bottom water Nd signature and precluding the reconstruction of past water mass provenance during the affected time intervals. However, we do not observe any definite indication of diffusive vertical migration of Nd into adjacent layers. Furthermore, bottom water Nd isotope signatures were not modified to a measurable degree by any potential benthic flux of Nd during the deposition of these detrital sediment layers. Consequently, the Nd isotope composition of the pelagic glacial Northeast Atlantic water masses were resilient to such episodic large detrital fluxes. Apart from extreme local sedimentation events, we confirm the presence of detritally overprinted deep waters north of 47°N during the peak glacial from comparison of Northeast Atlantic depth transects. We furthermore suggest that the sensitivity of deep waters to this overprinting effect increased during periods of reduced Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation and elevated ice rafting. Overall, our study demonstrates that a thorough evaluation of the proportion of Nd originating from physical water mass advection versus in situ chemical inputs is crucial for the reliable application of Nd isotopes as a water mass tracer.","turbidite,benthic flux,North Atlantic,neodymium isotopes,Heinrich Events,ocean circulation,"
"gulf of cadiz zooplankton: community structure, zonation and temporal variation","2020","This study provides the first comprehensive description of the Gulf of Cadiz (SW Spain) marine zooplankton community. To do this we compiled information from a number of surveys and monitoring programs carried out in the area over the last 14 years. Using this time-series of quarterly (3 times per year) resolution, we describe their general composition, spatio-temporal variability and relationship with environmental factors. Zooplankton is dominated by copepods (mainly Clausocalanus, Paracalanus, Oncaea and Oithona), except in warm periods, when outbreaks of cladocerans (mainly Penilia avirostris but also Podon intermedius and Pleopis polyphemoides) outnumber copepods, accounting for more than 80% of total abundance on occasion. Zooplankton diversity was found to be higher in deeper waters while the density of most taxa (but not their abundance) decreased towards the ocean. On top of this general coast-ocean pattern a north–south gradient could also be distinguished resulting in three distinct zones. In relation to environmental structuring, mesoscale processes, sea surface temperature, winds, river runoff and primary productivity were identified as main factors shaping this zonation. Overall, zooplankton abundance showed a decreasing trend during the study period (2001–2015), caused by a drop of summer abundances, that was mainly driven by cladocerans.","Cladocerans,Diversity,Gulf of Cadiz,Abundance,Spatial and seasonal variability,Community composition,Guadalquivir,Copepods,"

This article combines ocean research with the IoT, in order to investigate the wave height prediction to assist ships to improve the economy and safety of maritime transportation and proposes an ocean IoT Green Ocean of Things (GOoT) with a green and low-carbon concept.

"reliability of multi-purpose offshore-facilities: present status and future direction in australia","2021","Sustainable use of the ocean for food and energy production is an emerging area of research in different countries around the world. This goal is pursued by the Australian aquaculture, offshore engineering and renewable energy industries, research organisations and the government through the “Blue Economy Cooperative Research Centre”. To address the challenges of offshore food and energy production, leveraging the benefits of co-location, vertical integration, infrastructure and shared services, will be enabled through the development of novel Multi-Purpose Offshore-Platforms (MPOP). The structural integrity of the designed systems when being deployed in the harsh offshore environment is one of the main challenges in developing the MPOPs. Employing structural reliability analysis methods for assessing the structural safety of the novel aquaculture-MPOPs comes with different limitations. This review aims at shedding light on these limitations and discusses the current status and future directions for structural reliability analysis of a novel aquaculture-MPOP considering Australia’s unique environment. To achieve this aim, challenges which exist at different stages of reliability assessment, from data collection and uncertainty quantification to load and structural modelling and reliability analysis implementation, are discussed. Furthermore, several solutions to these challenges are proposed based on the existing knowledge in other sectors, and particularly from the offshore oil and gas industry. Based on the identified gaps in the review process, potential areas for future research are introduced to enable a safer and more reliable operation of the MPOPs.","Offshore platforms,Ocean multi-use,Blue economy,Structural integrity,Reliability analysis,"

"frequency based satellite monitoring of small scale explosive activity at remote north pacific volcanoes","2014","Monitoring of volcanoes in the North Pacific can be an expensive and sometimes dangerous task, specifically for those located in Alaska (USA) and Kamchatka (Russia). An active frequency detection method previously used at Stromboli, Italy, uses the thermal- and mid-infrared wavelength bands from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite data to detect anomalies at a volcano. This method focuses on small scale explosive activity, often referred to as Strombolian activity which can produce small spatter fields near a volcano's active vent. In the North Pacific, there are a number of volcanoes which exhibit small scale explosive activity and three are the focus of this study: Chuginadak (Mt. Cleveland) and Shishaldin in Alaska, and Karymsky Volcano in Kamchatka. Satellite images from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) were used to monitor the frequency of thermal features as well as the occurrence of ash plumes at each volcano. This data was then used to produce a time series spanning 2005–2010 for all three volcanoes. During this time period, each volcano underwent a series of eruptive cycles including background levels of activity, heightened frequency of small explosions (identified as precursory activity), and heightened activity typified by ash plume-producing eruptions. Each location has a unique precursory signal, both in timing and magnitude. The use of a previously developed method on a new sample set of volcanoes has proved the validity of this method as a monitoring tool for volcanoes with small scale explosive activity. This method should be applied to a larger set of volcanoes to continue the development and database production for its use as a volcano monitoring tool.","Thermal infrared,Explosive activity,Remote sensing,Volcano monitoring,North Pacific,"

"context-based models to overcome operational challenges in maritime security","2015","Piracy and smuggling are major international problems which not only threaten maritime security but also affect the global economy. Even though NATO and international forces have been relentlessly fighting maritime crime in East Africa (Gulf of Aden), the problems still persist and maritime crime has moved to West Africa (Gulf of Guinea). In the same vein, the Joint Interagency Task Force-South (JIATF-S) has had substantial operational success, controlling the vast geographical spread of smugglers in the East Pacific and Caribbean Sea. Due to limited number of maritime assets available, every resource needs to be efficiently allocated, both in time and space. This poses a great operational challenge requiring the integration and fusion of disparate information relevant to the mission and dynamic allocation of resources under uncertainty. Operational planning and execution for counter-smuggling and counter-piracy operations involve surveillance (to search, detect, track and identify potential threats) and interdiction operations (to intercept, investigate and potentially apprehend the suspects) in a dynamic and uncertain mission environment. In this paper, we present context-based models for counter-smuggling and counter-piracy missions, where the smuggling and piracy activities are represented in the form of color coded heat maps built using Intelligence information (INTEL), meteorological and oceanographic (METOC) information and other mission-specific attributes (sensor observations, target types and their behavior, etc.); these maps are interpreted as probability of activity (PoA) surfaces.

With prevailing winds, the forest fire spread rapidly to the north and within eleven days it burned about 410km2 of boreal forest. Coal seam fires can go unnoticed and unreported when present in remote and inaccessible areas. However, they still pose a serious threat to the surroundings. We used summer-time thermal infrared images from 1999 through 2009 acquired by the Landsat satellite and, through the process of image stacking, identified a region where the surface persistently showed temperatures 5°C to 14°C higher than the background areas. Field validation confirmed that this thermal anomaly area corresponds to a previously undocumented shallow coal seam fire. Superimposing the boundary of the Rex Creek forest fire revealed that the coal seam fire was at the southern end of the burn area where the forest fire originated. Plotting the location of all lightning strikes during this period helped to rule out lightning as the cause of the forest fire. Coal fires and forest fires can have a complex and dynamic relationship, one being the possible cause of the other. A thorough inventory of all past and present known coal seam fire locations can help to update forest fire hazard maps. A detailed map of shallow coal seam areas can help to prioritize fire fighting operations in order to avoid the chance of starting a new coal seam fire.","Forest fire,Remote sensing,Boreal forest,Coal fire,GIS,"
"restoration of maritime navigation systems in central american ports","1999","Summary form only given, as follows. This paper describes a project to reinstate maritime navigation in Central American (CA) ports that were devastated by the hurricane that occurred in November 1998. The project objectives were to install navigation facilities rapidly, and to use advanced technologies in the renovation to insure that the capabilities of the new systems would exceed those which existed before the hurricane. The damage to the ports and their installations and facilities was severe; but the ruination of their navigation systems also had far reaching effects. U.S. Secretary of Transportation, Rodney E. Slater, initiated a program to reconstruct the maritime navigation infrastructure in Central American ports. The Research and Special Programs Administration of the US/DOT, with technical support from the Volpe Center, was given the lead role in the CA Navigation Systems Revivification project. Working with the CA Commission of Maritime Transportation (COCATRAM), damage assessment was performed and a relief priority list was drawn up. The ports of Cortez and San Lorenzo in Honduras were hardest hit by the hurricane and consequently they were designated for the first replacements. The execution of the project required demanding logistics and acquisition planning that is detailed in the paper. It was decided to optimize the use of satellite technology where possible rather than revert only to the use of conventional aids to navigation. The Center for Navigation at the Volpe Center, capitalized on experience gained in navigation development projects for the Panama Canal and the Saint Lawrence Seaway to design and implement navigation and buoy positioning systems in CA. The differential Global Positioning Satellite system was selected as the primary signal source in order to provide highly accurate navigation in ports recovering from the hurricane.","Satellite navigation systems,damage assessment,Cortez,hurricane,Commission of Maritime Transportation,Marine vehicles,differential Global Positioning Satellite system,Global Positioning System,relief,Signal design,acquisition planning,Turning,ships,logistics,Central America ports,US Department of Transportation,Project management,San Lorenzo,Honduras,maritime navigation systems,Logistics,Hurricanes,Research and Special Programs Administration,navigation infrastructure,Irrigation,CA Navigation Systems Revivification project,"
"an intelligent maritime workplace using it technologies","2008","IT technologies over the past years have shown a rapid growth, on the contrary this increase of e-commerce and e-work in the maritime industry is not as intense as in any other field. E-commerce and e-work is still at its embryonic stages, however, the annual rate of increase suggest that in very few years this share will have grown dramatically. Thus, it is time to get prepared. The aim of the present paper is to present a new maritime intelligent workplace based weather information system and decision support for high-speed maritime transport. It has been achieved by linking fixed/mobile communications with navigation/positioning, efficient transmission and delivery over the geo-information network. These services will allow the shipmaster to have seamless access to, and interaction with intelligent, customised (route based) rich content multimedia information on the efficient and safe navigation passage for passengers, freights and the environment both on board ship and inland.","intelligent maritime workplace,Maritime,IT technologies,e-commerce,safe navigation passage,electronic commerce,geo-information network,navigation,e-work,multimedia systems,marine systems,content multimedia information,"
"some observations on climate variability as seen in daily temperature structure","1995","Distinctive annual cycles of daily maximum and minimum temperature and temperature range are observed across the United States when averaging daily data for multiple decades. In some cases, abrupt changes in the range between daily maximum and minimum temperatures are observed within annual cycles. Such discontinuities, or steps, of 5°C may occur within a week, despite the fact that the daily data are averaged over several decades. Discontinuities are most pronounced in the fall and spring, and display differing characteristics of timing, rapidity, magnitude and direction of change across the nation. In northern and central portions of the eastern U.S., a winter minimum and summer maximum in temperature range is observed, while in the southern U.S. the opposite is found. Abrupt discontinuities are observed in early November in the Northeast and in late spring and early summer in the Southeast and Southwest. Differences in mean daily temperature cycles between various portions of this century are a function of variations in maximum and minimum temperatures. The central U.S. had higher maximum and minimum temperatures during the 1930's than at other times this century, with little affect on daily temperature range. In the Northeast, the temperature range was lower in the 1930's, as a result of decreased maximum and increased minimum temperatures. The dynamics responsible for changes within the annual cycle or between different periods have not yet been unequivocally identified. The location of the polar front jet stream and its associations with solar radiation, clouds, snow cover and other atmospheric and surface variables are certainly involved. We believe that the identification of the climate system dynamics responsible for the structure of the annual cycle of daily temperature is a necessary first step in the study of potential human-induced climate change.",""
"background modeling combined with multiple features in the fourier domain for maritime infrared target detection","2022","To detect ship targets in dynamic sea backgrounds, a robust foreground detection method based on background modeling combined with multiple features in the Fourier domain (BMMFF) is proposed. Because the fluctuation of seawater is similar to a sine wave, the amplitude spectrum of the seawater in the Fourier domain has strong energy concentration, and the background model is built in the Fourier domain. The local statistical characteristics can effectively reflect the properties of a specific position, and the target frequency points are extracted by comparing the local statistical characteristic differences between the amplitude spectrum of the test frame and the updated background. Additionally, two different strategies are used to update the background for cases with or without sudden waves in two adjacent test frames. When the target and seawater have different contrast in different scenes, the threshold is set according to the seawaterâ€™s fluctuation degree, which is classified into three different levels in the training stage. Moreover, the linear correlation feature between the test frame and the updated background and the oscillation feature of the test frameâ€™s amplitude spectrum are proposed in the Fourier domain, which can better segment targets in relatively calm and violent sea scenes, respectively. Thus, the two features are combined with the background model with a reasonable strategy to further improve the detection accuracy. The experimental results demonstrate that BMMFF outperforms related comparison algorithms in different challenging sea scenes. The average false alarm rate of BMMFF is reduced by approximately 30% in the case where its average detection rate is similar to that of other algorithms.","target frequency points,linear correlation feature,Marine vehicles,Feature extraction,seawater,sea scenes,statistical analysis,dynamic sea backgrounds,ships,marine engineering,background modeling,object detection,ship targets,Oscillators,feature extraction,Correlation,Adaptation models,foreground detection method,infrared imaging,Dual-mode sea background model,local statistical characteristic differences,Object detection,image segmentation,Data mining,oscillation feature,Fourier domain,maritime infrared target detection,"
"an intelligent decision algorithm for the generation of maritime search and rescue emergency response plans","2019","Maritime search and rescue (SAR) decisions are the most important part of maritime SAR operations. In the process of making maritime SAR decisions, a key factor affecting efficiency and success rate is how to quickly respond to accidents and develop an emergency response plan. At present, maritime SAR emergency response plans are still mostly obtained through a combination of drift prediction models and SAR experience. There is a lack of SAR resource scheduling and SAR task assignment. The primary purpose of this paper is to explore the possibility of using an intelligent decision-making algorithm to formulate maritime SAR emergency response plans so as to produce results more scientifically. First, the relevant research areas and research data are briefly introduced, and the main mathematical models involved in the optimal search theory are expounded. Next, key technologies involved in the process of maritime SAR emergency response plan generation, including the determination of search area, the scheduling of SAR resources, the allocation of search tasks, and the planning of search routes, are analyzed in detail. Two optimization model algorithms, namely the SAR resource scheduling model based on genetic simulated annealing algorithm (GSAA) and the regional task allocation algorithm based on space-time characteristics, are proposed as approaches to solving the problem of resource scheduling and task allocation. Finally, the effectiveness and optimization of the proposed algorithms are verified by analyzing the emergency response of a real case which occurred in the Bohai Sea and comparing the different schemes. Through the algorithm proposed in this paper, the efficiency of maritime SAR operations can be effectively improved and the loss of life and property can be reduced.","planning,marine accidents,emergency management,maritime SAR decision making,intelligent decision-making algorithm,Prediction algorithms,SAR experience,Marine vehicles,maritime SAR emergency response plan generation,Resource management,intelligent decision algorithm,scheduling,genetic simulated annealing algorithm,genetic algorithms,task allocation,resources scheduling,drift prediction models,marine safety,Bohai Sea,SAR resource scheduling model,GSAA,mathematical models,Maritime SAR,space-time characteristics,search tasks,simulated annealing,decision making,SAR task assignment,Optimization,search problems,Trajectory,optimization model algorithms,optimization,regional task allocation algorithm,Scheduling,Task analysis,maritime search and rescue emergency response plan generation,search routes,optimal search theory,"
"debris slopes ventilation in the periglacial zone of the tatra mountains (poland and slovakia): the indicators","2012","This paper examines environmental indicators of debris slopes ventilation in the periglacial zone of the Tatra Mountains. Geomorphological and meteorological influences on ground surface temperature anomaly, hoarfrost, air ventilation funnels and snow melt windows, were analyzed as well as locations of long-lying snow and permafrost patches. The results show that debris slope ventilation is a common phenomenon occurring in different periods of the year. Its range is influenced mainly by substratum porosity (ground and snow cover), and the difference between the pressure inside and outside this medium (pore and atmospheric air temperature/dense; wind velocity). The height of the slope (‘chimney’) is less important. Some phenomena assumed to be evidences of slope ventilation are often connected with other factors influencing the thermal balance of the ground and the size of snow accumulation.","Tatra Mountains,Ground temperature,Debris slopes,Sporadic permafrost,Mountain environment,Air circulation,"
"robust cellular communications for unmanned aerial vehicles in maritime search and rescue","2019","Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) are a promising technology for fast, large scale survey operations such as maritime search and rescue (SAR). However, providing reliable communications over long distances remains a challenge. Cellular technology such as Long Term Evolution (LTE) is designed to perform well in the presence of fast-moving clients and highly dynamic channel conditions. Yet, its generic medium access mechanisms make it hard to support low-latency uplink traffic, which is needed for real-time command and control and similar applications. In this paper, we introduce an unmanned aerial system for maritime SAR, supported via an LTE data link. To mitigate drawbacks in uplink channel access, we develop a resource-guaranteed scheme based on persistent scheduling, using an open-source LTE stack. The approach is evaluated with a laboratory setup using software-defined radio modules. Measurements are taken on the application layer, using realworld telemetry data generated by an autopilot system in the presence of high bandwidth background traffic. Evaluations demonstrate that our system fulfills UAV requirements in terms of latency and reliability. Latency is further reduced to 6 ms on average and a 99.9th percentile of 10 ms by application-aware overprovisioning for mission-critical traffic and users.","unmanned aerial vehicles,telecommunication network reliability,robust cellular communications,medium access mechanisms,software-defined radio modules,autopilot system,emergency management,uplink channel access,Delays,Resource management,Reliability,maritime SAR,maritime search and rescue,high bandwidth background traffic,open-source LTE stack,real-time command and control,telecommunication scheduling,synchronisation,cellular technology,Uplink,cellular radio,LTE data link,aircraft communication,aircraft control,highly dynamic channel conditions,maritime search,low-latency uplink traffic,unmanned aerial system,command and control systems,autonomous aerial vehicles,telecommunication traffic,software radio,Unmanned aerial vehicles,Long Term Evolution,Base stations,resource allocation,"

"a novel ship collision risk evaluation algorithm based on the maximum interval of two ship domains and the violation degree of two ship domains","2022","In the research of ship collision avoidance, the evaluation of ship collision risk is an important part to determine whether there is a potential collision risk. In the field of ship collision avoidance, using an appropriate method to calculate the ship collision risk has always been a hot topic. To address the issues that only qualitative evaluation using the ship domain and the distance to the closest point of approach (DCPA) does not reflect the true distance between the two ships when the closest point of approach (CPA) parameters are used, a novel ship collision risk evaluation model is proposed. (1) A fuzzy quaternion ship domain (FQSD) model is established for the own ship (OS) and the target ship (TS) at the same time. (2) The two parameters the maximum interval of two ship domains (MISD) and the violation degree of two ship domains (VDSD) are introduced, which are solved based on Support Vector Machine for Classification (SVC) and geometric methods, respectively, and the ship collision probability model is established based on these two parameters. (3) Based on the momentum conservation theorem, considering the mass ratio of two ships, ship type, collision velocity and the location of the collision damage, the consequences of ship collision are calculated. (4) Based on the ship collision probability and ship collision consequences, a ship collision risk evaluation model is proposed. The simulation verification is performed under the three encounter situations of head-on, crossing, and overtaking, based on Maneuvering Model Group using the basic ship parameters of Dalian Maritime University's teaching-training ships “YUKUN” and “YUUPENG” to establish the model proposed in this paper. Simultaneously, it is compared to the ship collision risk evaluation method based on ship domain, CPA parameters, and spatial collision risk model. The simulation results demonstrate the superiority and efficacy of the ship collision risk evaluation algorithm proposed in this paper, which is an effective method for assessing ship collision risk.","Maneuvering model group,Ship domain,Collision risk evaluation,Ship collision avoidance,Support vector machine for classification,"
"the regional protocol for local communications among maritime autonomous surface ships based on vdes","2023","In order to provide more collision avoidance information to ships that may encounter each other in dense sea areas, prevent collision events, and minimize channel data pressure, ensure network reliability and reduce latency, this paper proposes a regional protocol for local communications among maritime autonomous surface ships based on VDES (High Frequency Data Exchange System). Based on the theoretical foundation of the ship domain model in the field of ships, the area where collision danger exists is found by guiding the ship domain model, and this area is used as the routing flood area, and the routing request is limited to this area. The improved AODV (Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector) routing forwarding algorithm is used to establish a communication link between ships in the routing request area using real-time location information. This can exchange more information with ships located in the collision risk area to assist in collaborative obstacle avoidance and prevent accidents. At the same time, it effectively avoids network-wide routing flooding, avoids network congestion, and ensures network stability. Simulation analysis shows that this protocol is superior to AIS in terms of delivery rate and delay on the basis of realizing business functions. This will be beneficial for obstacle avoidance between encountering ships.","channel data pressure,maritime autonomous surface ships,Marine vehicles,Delays,marine navigation,AODV routing protocol,regional protocol,communication link,routing protocols,high frequency data exchange system,ship field model,collision danger,collision risk area,Routing protocols,ships,marine safety,Stability criteria,collision avoidance information,network-wide routing flooding,telecommunication congestion control,mobile radio,Sea surface,routing request area,Collaboration,collaborative obstacle avoidance,collision events,dense sea areas,routing flood area,encountering ships,Routing,mobile robots,real-time location information,collision avoidance,ship domain model,VDES,local communications,network reliability,regional routing protocol,"
"a sensitivity quantification approach to significance analysis of thrusters in dynamic positioning operations","2021","The safety of offshore operations is highly dependent on the dynamic positioning (DP) capability of a vessel. Meanwhile, DP capability comes down to the ability of the thrust generated by thrusters to counteract environmental forces. Therefore, it is significant to investigate which thrusters are important to the position-keeping ability of vessels. However, complex environmental factors make the investigation of thrusters' importance more complicated. Hence, this paper proposes a new method to identify the influence of each thruster on vessel's station-keeping capability in different sea states. The station-keeping capability is quantified by a defined synthesized positioning ability criterion comprised by vessel position, heading angle, and consumed power. Through the comparison of different machine learning approaches, support vector machine (SVM) is used for building a surrogate model between DP capability and thrusters. In order to determine the most sensitive thruster in the whole process of vessel operation, an improved sensitivity analysis (SA) called ‘PAWN’ is employed along with statistical analysis to evaluate the significance of thrusters from different perspectives. Seventeen cases are investigated with respect to different thruster failures in various sea states. The results show the proposed method is able to identify the significance of each thruster in different scenarios.","Statistical analysis,Sensitivity analysis,Dynamic positioning capability,Thruster failures,"
"societal need for improved understanding of climate change, anthropogenic impacts, and geo-hazard warning drive development of ocean observatories in european seas","2011","Society’s needs for a network of in situ ocean observing systems cross many areas of earth and marine science. Here we review the science themes that benefit from data supplied from ocean observatories. Understanding from existing studies is fragmented to the extent that it lacks the coherent long-term monitoring needed to address questions at the scales essential to understand climate change and improve geo-hazard early warning. Data sets from the deep sea are particularly rare with long-term data available from only a few locations worldwide. These science areas have impacts on societal health and well-being and our awareness of ocean function in a shifting climate. Substantial efforts are underway to realise a network of open-ocean observatories around European Seas that will operate over multiple decades. Some systems are already collecting high-resolution data from surface, water column, seafloor, and sub-seafloor sensors linked to shore by satellite or cable connection in real or near-real time, along with samples and other data collected in a delayed mode. We expect that such observatories will contribute to answering major ocean science questions including: How can monitoring of factors such as seismic activity, pore fluid chemistry and pressure, and gas hydrate stability improve seismic, slope failure, and tsunami warning? What aspects of physical oceanography, biogeochemical cycling, and ecosystems will be most sensitive to climatic and anthropogenic change? What are natural versus anthropogenic changes? Most fundamentally, how are marine processes that occur at differing scales related? The development of ocean observatories provides a substantial opportunity for ocean science to evolve in Europe. Here we also describe some basic attributes of network design. Observatory networks provide the means to coordinate and integrate the collection of standardised data capable of bridging measurement scales across a dispersed area in European Seas adding needed certainty to estimates of future oceanic conditions. Observatory data can be analysed along with other data such as those from satellites, drifting floats, autonomous underwater vehicles, model analysis, and the known distribution and abundances of marine fauna in order to address some of the questions posed above. Standardised methods for information management are also becoming established to ensure better accessibility and traceability of these data sets and ultimately to increase their use for societal benefit. The connection of ocean observatory effort into larger frameworks including the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) and the Global Monitoring of Environment and Security (GMES) is integral to its success. It is in a greater integrated framework that the full potential of the component systems will be realised.",""
"use of the automatic identification system (ais) on autonomous weather buoys for maritime domain awareness applications","2006","The United States Coast Guard (USCG), as part of the Department of Homeland Security, is responsible for a wide variety of missions in the maritime domain. In order to support the accomplishment of these missions, the USCG needs to collect as much information as possible on activities occurring in the maritime domain. A large part of maritime activity relates to the movement of vessels. Therefore, detection, classification, identification and monitoring of vessels are a key component of what is known as Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA). The Automatic Identification System (AIS) is a technology that is used primarily as a tool for maritime safety, including vessel collision avoidance and as a means for coastal nations' Vessel Traffic Services (VTSs) to get information on vessels operating near their coasts. AIS equipment aboard vessels continuously and autonomously transmits information about the vessel including its identity, position, course, and speed to enhance safety. These transmissions can be received by other vessels or by land-based stations equipped with AIS receivers. The USCG sees the capability AIS provides, particularly for vessel tracking, as a major contributor to MDA and VTS. To extend the capability of USCG land-based AIS monitoring stations further offshore, the USCG Maritime Domain Awareness Program Integration Office sponsored the development of a near real-time, autonomous automatic identification and telemetry system based on AIS technology for installation on National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) weather buoys through the National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) and its technical support contractor, Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC).","Satellites,prototype system,satellite telemetry,Monitoring,geosynchronous satellite transmission system,Transmitters,satellite transmitter,AD 2005 03 to 2005 06,autonomous weather buoys,Assembly systems,oceanographic equipment,Relays,AIS-equipped vessel detection,Automatic Identification System,Cape Cod,Maritime Domain Awareness applications,MDA,Prototypes,Charleston,Strait of Juan de Fuca,offshore installations,Telemetry,real-time relay,Real time systems,USCG,South Carolina,national security,meteorology,AIS receiver,NDBC Data Assembly Center,NDAC,Massachusetts,marine vehicles,collision avoidance,System testing,Embedded system,San Francisco Harbor,"
"simulated meteorological input for agricultural models","1997","Many agricultural models need an input of daily weather, and a common way of accommodating this is by simulation. Long daily records are rare for agricultural sites, but it is usually possible to obtain climatic parameters to use as input for a s stochastic model. An additional advantage to simulated weather is that many likely sequences can be generated, whereas observation furnishes only a single realization. The objective of this study was to develop a model to simulate weather records, that places emphasis on realistic variability, sequences, extremes and cross-correlation, as well as mean conditions. The model was designated Simulated Meteorological Input for Agricultural Models (SIMIAM), and relies on selection of air mass as the first stochastic step. All required variables are then generated using air mass statistics. The day's wet or dry character is ascertained by first-order Markov chain and, if wet, precipitation amount simulated in a two-parameter gamma distribution. A weakly-stationary generating system, that incorporates matrices of cross and auto-correlation coefficients, is used to simulate all other variables, including winds. Amarillo, Texas records were used to demonstrate model feasibility. Significantly different air masses were shown to be identifiable by gradient level wind directions, and their sequence was adequately modeled with a first-order Markovian process. SIMIAM was tested for Amorillo, Oklahoma City, and New Orleans, using 15 years of record to compute input (1961–1975), and comparing simulations against an independent 15 years of observations (1976–1990). Results indicated that the study objectives were mostly satisfied for the two inland cities. As input was compiled from discontinuous, multiple, area sources, these tests were robust. They were also considered to demonstrate model applicability, not only to point locations, but to areas of the south central United States. Test results for New Orleans were less acceptable, and further study is clearly necessary to achieve model transportability to different climatic zones.","Simulated weather,Weather,Agricultural models,Climatic zones,"

This paper then explores similarities and differences between this task analysis and one proposed by Roth and Multer (2009). It is argued that these two task analyses can form the basis for many future task analyses so that we can avoid ‘reinventing the wheel,’ allowing us to focus more on potential interesting differences between operations and geographical locations.","Task analysis,Train driving,Technology,"
"location-aware dynamic beam scheduling for maritime communication systems","2018","Currently, LTE cellular systems provide an excellent solution to broadband multimedia data transmission on intensive coverage area. However, in the scenarios of maritime communication, wide coverage with sparse user distribution makes it very hard and expensive to improve resource efficiency. In order to increase coverage area and reduce hardware cost, phased array antenna is used to increase the directional power with lower hardware cost, and becomes a better choice for maritime networks. In this paper, a location-aware communication system is proposed. As an important part of this system, a novel beam scheduling algorithm is proposed to reach a compromise between throughput and user fairness. The algorithm combines proportional fair scheduling algorithm and the scheduling of beams, and get a good balance of fairness and efficiency. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively improve the performance of maritime networks.","broadband multimedia data transmission,phased array antenna,Throughput,Directive antennas,scheduling,proportional fair scheduling algorithm,location-aware communication system,telecommunication scheduling,maritime networks,proportional fair,beam scheduling,sparse user distribution,directional power,maritime communication systems,location-aware,resource efficiency,maritime communication,novel beam scheduling algorithm,LTE cellular systems,Phased arrays,location-aware dynamic beam scheduling,marine communication,intensive coverage area,location based services,Long Term Evolution,user fairness,resource allocation,Arrays,"
"a new road safety indicator based on vehicle trajectory analysis","2016","In 2014, in France, accidents on rural roads accounted for roughly 63% of road mortality (ONISR, 2014). Yet, the locations of accidents are increasingly spread, and it is becoming difficult for road managers to set priorities for interventions on their road network. They can no longer base their strategy on accident analysis. Road managers need to quickly measure the effectiveness of a modified facility, improvement of facilities or modification of the environment. On this type of site accident analysis requires a period of 3 to 5 years to determine the effectiveness of a change. This period of time does not meet the requirements of road managers or road users. To provide a high safety level, managers are implementing innovative developments: wall effect chicane at crossroads, dynamic warning signs, rural roundabouts, etc. Managers want to quickly assess these innovations. In addition, they have less and less money, so it is necessary to give them tools to help prioritize their intervention. It is also preferable for road managers to take preventive action rather than having to wait for accidents or serious injuries to occur, in order to carry out diagnosis and propose countermeasures. In this article, we propose a new safety indicator based on trajectory analysis. By trajectory, we mean a time-function that describes vehicle movement including not only its path on the road but also speeds and accelerations in both horizontal directions (longitudinal and transverse). These trajectories describe vehicle/infrastructure/driver interactions and reveal inadequacies that can lead to accidents. These trajectories are obtained using two roadside observation systems that analyse vehicle trajectories on two specific locations: curves and intersections on rural roads. The first tool is a local trajectory measurement system. It records trajectories of all vehicles passing through a specific zone. The goal is to observe abnormal paths that reveal dysfunctions in the vehicle/Infrastructure/driver system. The main applications-related contribution of this work focuses on developing a comprehensive solution for accurately estimating vehicle trajectories based on a combination of video images and range finder (telemeter) measurements. The purpose of the second tool is to improve understanding of dysfunctions at a crossroads and to evaluate the effectiveness of facilities. A precise study of patterns encountered on accident-prone intersections on rural roads showed that some situations are much more dangerous and frequent than others. In particular, most accidents at intersections are caused by vehicles crossing main roads. The second system presented in this paper detects and records conflicts between users on the secondary road who are crossing the main road, and users driving straight ahead on the main road. This kind of conflict represents the main type of accidents called crossing at grade accidents. The proposed risk indicator is equal to the number of conflicts (near-misses), weighted by the severity of the conflicts recorded in a given period. We chose to take the number of conflicts per hour. The purpose of these tools is to understand anomalies in the vehicle/infrastructure/driver system, and to evaluate the effectiveness of countermeasures on safety. Associated with risk indicators they make it possible to objectively assess driver behaviours with respect to the road infrastructure.","safety,trajectories,curves,intersections,evaluation,"

"enhanced loran: real-time maritime trials","2008","Enhanced Loran (eLoran) is rapidly emerging as the primary GNSS backup for the new, global, maritime e- Navigation concept. Europe was ready to turn off all the Loran transmitters at the end of 2005. However, an increased understanding of GNSS vulnerability and a growing appreciation of eLoran's role within e-Navigation has resulted not only in a kiss-of-life for all the transmitters but also in the placing of a 15-year contract for a new Loran station at Anthorn in the United Kingdom. This has been accompanied by the establishment of a new, European eLoran Forum for service providers, real-time differential Loran trials and the funding of doctoral students for fundamental research into eLoran operational concepts. This paper will start by reviewing the motivation for eLoran in the European environment before describing the current status of the Anthorn status as part of the European Loran network. The paper will then report on results of sub-10 m real-time maritime eLoran trials carried out at Harwich as well as ongoing plans for additional trials in the Orkney and Shetland islands in Northern Scotland.

"organic contaminants in bats: trends and new issues","2014","Exposure to contaminants, often pesticides, has been implicated as a major factor contributing to decreases in bat populations. Bats provide essential ecosystem services and a sustained, thriving population is vital for ecosystem health. Understanding issues threatening their survival is crucial for their protection and conservation. This paper provides the first review for 12years on organic pollutants in bats and aims to investigate trends and any new issues impacting bat resilience. Organochlorine (OC) pesticides have been reported most often, especially in the older literature, with the dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) metabolite, dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), present at highest concentrations in tissues analyzed. The OC pesticide concentrations reported in bat tissues have declined significantly since the late 1970s, presumably as a result of restrictions in use. For example, DDE study mean concentrations over time periods 1970–1980, 1981–1999 and 2000–2013 ranged from 2.6-62, 0.05–2.31, 0.08–0.19ppm wet weight, respectively. Exposure, however, still occurs from remaining residues, many years after the compounds have been actively used. In recent years (2000–2013), a range of other organic chemicals have been reported in bat tissues including brominated flame retardants (polybrominated diphenyl ether at a mean concentration of 2.9ppm lipid weight) and perfluorinated compounds (perfluorooctanyl sulfonate at a mean concentration 0.09ppm wet weight). The persistent organic compounds concentrate in tissues with higher fat content notably back-depot fat. Numerous factors influence exposure, residues detected and concentrations in different individuals, species and tissues which must be understood to provide meaningful assessment of the impacts of exposure. Exposure can lead to not only acute and lethal impacts, but also physiological sub-lethal and chronic effects, often linked to the annual cycle of fat deposition and withdrawal. Current challenges for bat conservation include collation of a more extensive and standardized database of bat exposure, especially to current use pesticides and emerging contaminants, and better prediction and definition of toxicity end points notably for the sub-lethal effects. Understanding sub-lethal effects will be of greater importance for sustaining populations in the longer-term.","Bats,Organic contaminants,Pesticides,Mortality,"
"psr-based feature adaptation with anomaly re-prediction for maritime target tracking","2022","The tracking method for the relevant filter cannot track when the target is affected by the background and in the scene of occlusion. We propose a target tracking algorithm based on the peak-to-sidelobe ratio (PSR) feature weight adaptation with anomaly re-detection based on the efficient convolution operator for manual features (ECO_HC) algorithm. The weights of the HOG features and CN features corresponding to the peak-to-sidelobe ratio are used as dynamic weight coefficients, and the maximum response value after their fusion is the area where the target may appear. Determine the target tracking status by calculating the tracking confidence of the response map, and when there is a tracking anomaly, the ECO_HC tracker is enhanced using the Kalman filter to re-predict the target position. The proposed algorithm has experimented on the OTB-50 dataset. The results show that our algorithm can cope with complex scenarios and improves by 3.0% in tracking accuracy and 2.8% in tracking success rate compared with the baseline algorithm ECO_HC. Finally, conduct tracking experiments on the actual sea surface scenes, and the proposed algorithm effectively suppresses the effects of common interference factors on the tracking effect.","response map,anomaly re-detection,tracking success rate,baseline algorithm ECO_HC,Kalman filter,Kalman filters,tracking anomaly,Prediction algorithms,target tracking status,PSR-based feature adaptation,dynamic weight coefficients,tracking confidence,maximum response value,ECO_HC tracker,tracking effect,Filtering algorithms,Filtering,feature dynamic fusion,target tracking,actual sea surface scenes,efficient convolution operator,object tracking,HOG features,manual features algorithm,relevant filter,target position,Target tracking,correlation filter,feature extraction,tracking method,Sea surface,target tracking algorithm,weight adaptation,anomaly prediction,CN features,Anomaly Re-Prediction,Interference,maritime target tracking,Heuristic algorithms,peak-to-sidelobe ratio,"
"mobile data fusion from multiple tracking sensors to augment maritime safety: mobile detection, early identification, and tracking of moving objects","2015","We present a novel mobile solution to provide efficient services for data fusion towards augmenting maritime safety. It is the first, to the best authors knowledge, complex and integrated fusion of data coming from multiple mobile and typical tracking sensors (e.g. Low weight/high performance radar, position transmission mechanisms and electro-optic/systems and hyper-spectral sensors). The key aim is to assist the detection and early identification and tracking of moving targets (e.g. With moving target indication and data fusion/correlation capabilities), as well as methods for obstacle detection and maritime surveillance. Maritime mobile services have to exchange real time data with multiple maritime/aerial assets no matter where the operation is conducted (close to harbors or at the open sea) and independently from the existing surveillance infrastructure. The proposed approach is also useful for the detection of marine pollution incidents.

"maritime radar odometry inspired by visual odometry","2023","Future autonomous ships will need several redundant positioning systems to navigate reliably. Global Navigation Satellite Systems are highly accurate but they are susceptible to disruptions and intentional jamming.

In this work, we present a radar odometry estimation method inspired by advances in visual odometry and simultaneous localization and mapping. The method works on raw radar data in a coastal environment and combines the Kanade-Lucas-Tomashi tracker with a factor graph back-end.

"unsupervised cross-domain rolling bearing fault diagnosis based on time-frequency information fusion","2023","In recent years, data-driven methods have been widely used in rolling bearing fault diagnosis with great success, which mainly relies on the same data distribution and massive labeled data. However, bearing equipment is in normal working state for most of the time and operates under variable operating conditions. This makes it difficult to obtain bearing data labels, and the distribution of the collected samples varies widely. To address these problems, an unsupervised cross-domain fault diagnosis method based on time-frequency information fusion is proposed in this paper. Firstly, wavelet packet decomposition and reconstruction are carried out on the bearing vibration signal, and the energy eigenvectors of each sub-band are extracted to obtain a 2-D time-frequency map of fault features. Secondly, an unsupervised cross-domain fault diagnosis model is constructed, the improved maximum mean discrepancy algorithm is used as the measurement standard, and the joint distribution distance is calculated with the help of pseudo-labels to reduce data distribution differences. Finally, the model is applied to the motor bearing for comparison and verification. The results demonstrate its high diagnosis accuracy and strong robustness.",""

This flooding of RREQ generates severe overheads in a maritime multi-hop ad-hoc network (MMANet) due to limited small bandwidth. In this paper, to improve the throughput of bandwidth-limited MMANet, we propose a geographical AODV (GAODV) protocol. The key feature of the GAODV is the selective broadcast of RREQ using position information. The routing overhead-traffic of the GAODV is smaller than that of AODV.

"green, grey and black: a comparative study of sierra de las navajas (mexico) and lipari (italy) obsidians","2018","Sierra de Las Navajas (State of Hidalgo, Mexico) and Lipari (Aeolian Islands, Italy) were among the most important sources for obsidian trade in Mesoamerica and in the Mediterranean during the Stone Age. In this paper obsidians from these two localities were compared in terms of their aspect, chemical composition, microcrystallinity and microvesiculation. In Sierra de las Navajas, the typical deep green obsidian with a golden hue has been analyzed together with a less common dark grey, porphyritic variety. Lipari obsidian is commonly black, but a light grey variety also occurs. Obsidian of both varieties was analyzed for this paper. Microvesicularity was investigated through Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) observation, microporosimetry and, for Sierra de las Navajas green obsidian, through a preliminary X-ray computed microtomographic study. Crystallinity and micro- or nano-crystallinity were investigated through X-Ray Powder Diffraction and EDS (Energy Dispersion System) microanalyses. Finally, the chemical composition in terms of major and trace elements, including rare earth elements, was determined using X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) and Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS). The comparison of samples of different colors suggests that the characteristic green color of Sierra de las Navajas obsidians could be related to their relatively high iron content, and to the occurrence of many elongated and iso-oriented vesicles which may also be responsible for the obsidian's golden hue. Low iron and an absence of vesicles give Lipari obsidian its “normal” black color. The light grey obsidian from Lipari probably owes its color and imperfect conchoidal fracture to numerous bubbles of less than 1 μm in size and to nano-crystallinity. Sierra de las Navajas obsidians show a significant chemical variability in terms of trace elements, that can be explained by common evolutionary processes in the magma chamber. However, this variability is also internal to a single volcanic complex and this makes the trace element contents unsuitable to differentiating between the different sub-sources of the same area. On Lipari, our data do not allow us to distinguish between the two sub-sources of Vallone del Gabellotto and Canneto Dentro on the basis of major and trace elements. On the whole, our study suggests that caution should be used for both Lipari and Sierra de las Navajas when identifying obsidian sub-sources on the basis of trace element contents.","Sierra de las Navajas (Mexico),XRF and ICP-MS analyses,Obsidian source analyses,Lipari (Aeolian Islands),Obsidian color,Microvesiculation,Microtexture,"
"multi-radar multi-target tracking algorithm for maritime surveillance at oth distances","2016","The aim of this paper is to propose, develop and test multi-radar multi-target tracking algorithm for maritime surveillance at over-the-horizon (OTH) distances. The proposed algorithm utilizes a weighted pure minimum mean square error (MMSE) algorithm for multi-radar data fusion and adaptive alpha â€” beta tracking algorithm for target tracking. The developed data fusion algorithm calculates the weighted center of mass of all targets observed by OTH radars (OTHRs) within a gate radius of predicted position, and uses it for a track update process. During the process a weighting factor which will be used in an adaptive alpha-beta tracking algorithm is derived. The weighting factor as well as alpha and beta factors are updated in each observation period and depend on all targets, which have fallen into a gate radius during the track update process. The algorithm is designed, implemented, and tested in an environment consisting of a simulated network of two OTHRs with significantly overlapping surveillance areas.","weighted pure minimum mean square error algorithm,sensor fusion,marine radar,adaptive alpha-beta tracking algorithm,Prediction algorithms,multiradar data fusion algorithm,data fusion,target tracking,marine systems,over-the-horizon distance,maritime surveillance,Target tracking,OTH distance,MMSE algorithm,least mean squares methods,search radar,Radar tracking,multiradar multitarget tracking algorithm,Radar,HF radar,Data integration,radar tracking,OTHR,OTH radar,Surveillance,"
"chapter 10 - trindade island: evolution of the geological knowledge","2022","The history of Trindade Island dates back to the European discovery of Brazil (CE 1500), during foreign invasions and the Brazilian Imperial Court's political measures to legislate land property by the 19th century. The island is located at ca. 20° latitude in Espírito Santo State (Brazil), ca. 1200km from the Brazilian coast, and is associated with the Vitória-Trindade Fracture Zone formed during the opening of the Atlantic Ocean. During the last Plio-Pleistocene, the island recorded five main formations separated in five volcanic successions: (1) Trindade Complex (3.8–2.5Ma), which is observed in 16 elliptical phonolitic necks, and is composed, mainly, of pyroclastic rocks, mostly lapilli-tuffs of nephelinitic composition, breccias, tuff-breccias to lapillistone of phonolitic to pyroxenitic composition; (2) Desejado Formation (2.8–1.5Ma), which occupies the center of the island and is composed of phonolitic effusive deposits (grazinite) intercalating tuffs and lapilli-tuffs, olivine-free nephelinitic lava flows intercalated with tuffs, and phonolitic lava flows intercalated with large amounts of tuffs, lapilli-tuffs, and breccias; (3) Valado Formation (1.20–1.11Ma) is composed of melilite olivine-rich nephelinitic effusive deposits of scoriaceous nephelinitic tuff-breccias with minor amounts of lapilli-tuffs and breccias; (4) Morro Vermelho Formation (0.27–0.17Ma), which is represented by intercalation of effusive and pyroclastic deposits, of basanitic composition with a large preserved lava plateau; and (5) Paredão Formation (<0.23Ma) is a melilite olivine-rich nephelinite succession of pyroclastic deposits, intercalated with minor effusive deposits, which contains the only preserved volcanic cone in Brazil.","Mantle plume,Tribute to Almeida,Plio-Pleistocene,Earth science,State of the art,Phonolite-nephelinite,"
"global navigation satellite systems performance analysis and augmentation strategies in aviation","2017","In an era of significant air traffic expansion characterized by a rising congestion of the radiofrequency spectrum and a widespread introduction of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are being exposed to a variety of threats including signal interferences, adverse propagation effects and challenging platform-satellite relative dynamics. Thus, there is a need to characterize GNSS signal degradations and assess the effects of interfering sources on the performance of avionics GNSS receivers and augmentation systems used for an increasing number of mission-essential and safety-critical aviation tasks (e.g., experimental flight testing, flight inspection/certification of ground-based radio navigation aids, wide area navigation and precision approach). GNSS signal deteriorations typically occur due to antenna obscuration caused by natural and man-made obstructions present in the environment (e.g., elevated terrain and tall buildings when flying at low altitude) or by the aircraft itself during manoeuvring (e.g., aircraft wings and empennage masking the on-board GNSS antenna), ionospheric scintillation, Doppler shift, multipath, jamming and spurious satellite transmissions. Anyone of these phenomena can result in partial to total loss of tracking and possible tracking errors, depending on the severity of the effect and the receiver characteristics. After designing GNSS performance threats, the various augmentation strategies adopted in the Communication, Navigation, Surveillance/Air Traffic Management and Avionics (CNS + A) context are addressed in detail. GNSS augmentation can take many forms but all strategies share the same fundamental principle of providing supplementary information whose objective is improving the performance and/or trustworthiness of the system. Hence it is of paramount importance to consider the synergies offered by different augmentation strategies including Space Based Augmentation System (SBAS), Ground Based Augmentation System (GBAS), Aircraft Based Augmentation System (ABAS) and Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM). Furthermore, by employing multi-GNSS constellations and multi-sensor data fusion techniques, improvements in availability and continuity can be obtained. SBAS is designed to improve GNSS system integrity and accuracy for aircraft navigation and landing, while an alternative approach to GNSS augmentation is to transmit integrity and differential correction messages from ground-based augmentation systems (GBAS). In addition to existing space and ground based augmentation systems, GNSS augmentation may take the form of additional information being provided by other on-board avionics systems, such as in ABAS. As these on-board systems normally operate via separate principles than GNSS, they are not subject to the same sources of error or interference. Using suitable data link and data processing technologies on the ground, a certified ABAS capability could be a core element of a future GNSS Space-Ground-Aircraft Augmentation Network (SGAAN). Although current augmentation systems can provide significant improvement of GNSS navigation performance, a properly designed and flight-certified SGAAN could play a key role in trusted autonomous system and cyber-physical system applications such as UAS Sense-and-Avoid (SAA).","Differential GNSS,High-integrity systems,Aerospace electronic systems,Air navigation,Avionics,Integrity monitoring,GNSS augmentation,Cyber-physical systems,Ground based augmentation system,Receiver autonomous integrity monitoring,Safety-critical aviation applications,Aircraft based augmentation system,Aviation security,GNSS performance,Global navigation satellite system,Satellite based augmentation system,"
"forecasting the impact of an 1859-calibre superstorm on satellite resources","2006","We have developed simple models to assess the economic impacts to the current satellite resource caused by the worst-case scenario of a hypothetical superstorm event occurring during the next sunspot cycle. Although the consequences may be severe, our worse-case scenario does not include the complete failure of the entire 937 operating satellites in the current population, which have a replacement value of ∼$170–230 billion, and supporting a ∼$90 billion/year industry. Our estimates suggest a potential economic loss of <$70 billion for lost revenue (∼$44 billion) and satellite replacement for GEO satellites (∼$24 billion) caused by a ‘once a century’ single storm similar to the 1859 superstorm. We estimate that 80 satellites (LEO, MEO, and GEO) may be disabled as a consequence of a superstorm event. Additional impacts may include the failure of many of the GPS, GLONASS, and Galileo satellite systems in MEO. Approximately 97 LEO satellites, which normally would not have re-entered for many decades, may prematurely de-orbit by ca 2021 as a result of the temporarily increased atmospheric drag caused by a superstorm event occurring in ca. 2012. The $100 billion International Space Station may lose significant altitude, placing it in critical need for re-boosting by an amount potentially outside the range of typical Space Shuttle operations, which are in any case scheduled to end in 2010. Currently, the ability to forecast extreme particle events and coronal mass ejections, or predict their fluences and geoseverity in the 24-h prior to the event, appears to be no better than 50/50. Our analysis of economic impacts is a first attempt at estimation whose approach will suggest ways in which better estimates may eventually be obtained.","Satellite anomalies,Radiation sickness,Technology impacts,Satellite failures,Space weather,Superstorms,Economic impacts,"
"dynamic effective connectivity network based on change points detection","2022","Human brain networks can be modeled as a system of interconnected brain regions which are recorded by time-dependent observations with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In order to spot trends, detect anomalies, and interpret the temporal dynamics, it is essential to understand the connections among distinct brain regions, and how these connections evolve over time. However, the change points of dynamic reorganization in brain connectivity are unknown, which may occur frequently during the scanning session. In this paper, we introduce a fused lasso regression approach to detect the number and position of rapid connectivity changes of subject and subsequently estimate the brain effective connectivity networks within each state phase lying between consecutive change points by conditional Granger causality method from fMRI time series data. The performance of the method is verified via numerical simulations and the obtained classification accuracy with support vector machine (SVM) was 86.24% in 140 subjects from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Compared with static EC model and conventional dynamic EC model based on sliding window technique, the experimental results show that the fused lasso achieved better classification effect, which probably due to better dynamic description. The result shows that the dynamic effective connectivity based on change points detected by fused lasso method is a better feature for classification.","Alzheimer’s disease (AD),Dynamic brain connectivity,Granger causality analysis,Change points detection,Fused lasso regression,"

Thus we present informed and non-informed methods used to search the environment. The informed method relies on an obtained probabilistic map, while the non-informed method navigates the UAVs along predefined paths computed with respect to the environment.

"glacial conditioning of stream position and flooding in the braid plain of the exit glacier foreland, alaska","2017","Flow spilling out of an active braid plain often signals the onset of channel migration or avulsion to previously occupied areas. In a recently deglaciated environment, distinguishing between shifts in active braid plain location, considered reversible by fluvial processes at short timescales, and more permanent glacier-conditioned changes in stream position can be critical to understanding flood hazards. Between 2009 and 2014, increased spilling from the Exit Creek braid plain in Kenai Fjords National Park, Alaska, repeatedly overtopped the only access road to the popular Exit Glacier visitor facilities and trails. To understand the likely cause of road flooding, we consider recent processes and the interplay between glacier and fluvial system dynamics since the maximum advance of the Little Ice Age, around 1815. Patterns of temperature and precipitation, the variables that drive high streamflow via snowmelt, glacier meltwater runoff, and rainfall, could not fully explain the timing of road floods. Comparison of high-resolution topographic data between 2008 and 2012 showed a strong pattern of braid plain aggradation along 3km of glacier foreland, not unexpected at the base of mountainous glaciers and likely an impetus for channel migration. Historically, a dynamic zone follows the retreating glacier in which channel positions shift rapidly in response to changes in the glacier margin and fresh morainal deposits. This period of paraglacial adjustment lasts one to several decades at Exit Glacier. Subsequently, as moraine breaches consolidate and lock the channel into position, and as the stream regains the lower-elevation valley center, upper-elevation surfaces are abandoned as terraces inaccessible by fluvial processes for timescales of decades to centuries. Where not constrained by these terraces and moraines, the channel is free to migrate, which in this aggradational setting generates an alluvial fan at the breach of the final prominent moraine. The position of this fan is glacially conditioned but the process of migration of the braided channels across it is not. This broad perspective on channel controls identifies incipient avulsion into the roadside forest as part of a long-term fan-building process independent from changes in streamflow or sediment load.","Braid plains,Flooding,Channel migration,Deglaciation,Alluvial fans,Exit Glacier,"
"size effects on structural and optical properties of tin oxide quantum dots with enhanced quantum confinement","2020","Size-controllable tin oxide (SnO2) quantum dots (QDs) in aqueous solution were prepared by using stannous chloride and thiourea as source materials and the hydrothermal treatment was employed for size control during the self-assembly of SnO2 QDs. The size effects on structural and optical properties of QDs were discussed. The prepared QDs were confirmed to be of rutile structure with (202), (211) and (330) facets observed. The crystal lattice constants changed their dimensions during grain growth and secondary grain boundaries appeared if grain size was over 7nm. The composition and valence states were found independent with grain size. A negative correlation was observed between size and band gap, which exhibited much greater values than the calculation results from the theory of effective mass approximation and illustrated a strong quantum confinement in the present SnO2 QDs. The size effect of photoluminescence property illustrated a fluorescence inhibition, which could be ascribed to the additional energy levels provided by the lattice distortions at secondary grain boundaries. The depletion region in QDs was extended by these defects, which strengthened the quantum confinement effect.","Optical property,Size effect,Confinement effect,Tin oxide,Quantum dots,"
"sperm whale (physeter macrocephalus) acoustic ecology at ocean station papa in the gulf of alaska – part 1: detectability and seasonality","2019","Sperm whales Physeter macrocephalus produce loud, stereotypical click sequences and are an ideal species to be studied with passive acoustic techniques. To increase our limited knowledge of sperm whale occurrence patterns in remote and inaccessible locations of the North Pacific, we analyzed a five-year-long (June 2007–April 2012) acoustic data set recorded at Ocean Station PAPA (OSP; 50°N, 145°W) in the Gulf of Alaska (GOA). Firstly, we assessed the sperm whale detection performance of the Passive Aquatic Listener (PAL), and secondly, we investigated temporal patterns of sperm whale presence at OSP. The PAL proved highly efficient, with above 50% probability of detecting more than two sperm whales, a condition met for over 50% of the recordings. Results indicated that sperm whale clicks were recorded year-round, with a clear seasonal pattern. The number of detections during the summer months was approximately 70% higher compared to winter. An ambient noise analysis showed that differences in detection rates were likely not driven by seasonal changes in ambient noise levels. The average propagation range of sperm whale clicks ranged between 7 and 8 km between summer and winter, with slightly decreased detection distances observed in winter. Seasonal shifts in the intensity of the Alaska Current and the latitudinal oscillations of the North Pacific Transition Zone results in changes in water mixing, transport of nutrients and the concentration of prey such as squid, which likely drives sperm whale distribution.","Ocean Station PAPA,Sperm whale (),North Pacific Transition Zone,Passive Aquatic Listener,Gulf of Alaska,Passive Acoustic Monitoring,Seasonality,"

Low-blank trace element and Sr-Nd isotope ratio data were evaluated with a multiclass regression provenance prediction model. This study demonstrates that the pan-Caribbean exchange of jade raw materials, pre-forms or finished objects during the Ceramic Age (400 BC to AD 1492) occurred on a more complex scale than previously thought involving jade sources in Guatemala, eastern Cuba and the northern Dominican Republic.

"maritime opportunistic transmission: when and how much can dtn node deliver?","2019","Maritime wireless communication delay tolerant networks (MWDTN) may develop slowly, if there is no efficient scheme to allocate network resources which are arrival data and limited energy. In this paper, we investigate the resources scheduling problem to utilize the sleeping scheduling (SS) and opportunistic transmission (OT) for energy conservation, while guaranteeing the Quality-of-Service (QoS) with worst-case delay. In addition, we assume the node of delay tolerant networks (DTN) only uses green energy absorbed from the sun and wind. We establish a reasonable harvest-and-consumption energy model. Considering to make a delay-energy tradeoff, an optimization algorithm based on Lyapunov optimization (LO), which makes the transmission determination for waking-up the DTN node and determines the optimal data quantity should be transmitted for current system state, is proposed to cope with the delay-energy tradeoff problem.

"additive manufacturing of ultra-high strength steels: a review","2023","Ultra-high strength steels (UHSSs) have excellently comprehensive mechanical properties, which has attracted significant interest in their advanced manufacturing. Additively manufactured UHSSs have a unique microstructure that provides significant potential to achieve good mechanical properties. This paper reviews the latest research progress in the additive manufacturing (AM) of UHSSs with a special focus on defect optimization, microstructure-property regulation and the application of advanced assisted techniques for additively manufactured UHSSs. The property origin of UHSSs is firstly summarized in detail, including the influence of different alloying elements and phase composition in the microstructure on the mechanical properties of UHSSs. The AM techniques used to fabricate UHSSs and the characteristics of their forming microstructure are further illustrated, which involve laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF), laser direct energy deposition (L-DED), and wire arc additive manufacturing (WAAM). The research progress on the three typical techniques for UHSSs is also reviewed. Moreover, the property regulation methodology of UHSSs is reviewed, mainly in the optimization of defects and the adjustment of the whole forming process. Significantly, the shortcomings of the present researches on AMed UHSSs and future challenges for development are discussed. This work is important for a better scientific understanding of AMed UHSSs and provides vital meaningful guidelines for the future work in UHSSs manufacturing.","Microstructure,Ultra-high strength steels,Process-microstructure-property regulation,Defect optimization,Additive manufacturing,"
"a generic anomaly detection approach applied to mixture-of-unigrams and maritime surveillance data","2019","This paper proposes a new generic method to detect anomalies (i.e., statistical outliers) which can be used with a generative topic model. In this paper, we specify this method in the context of the Mixture-of-unigrams model, which is widely used in text mining. It is possible to detect anomalies with a topic model by applying a threshold to the likelihood. However, it is challenging to choose the threshold since the choice needs to consider both the similarities of the topics and the length of documents. This paper describes a new intuitive method to detect anomalies which simply manipulates the output of the trained model. Such an approach is anticipated to have parameters that are more intuitive to define for a given problem. To assess the utility of the proposed approach, we also present a use case involving identifying ships misreporting their ship-type using geo-location data from the Automatic Identification System (AIS) messages. We show that, if we train a model using data for one type of ship, it is possible to identify ships of another type as anomalous.","geo-location data,data mining,Anomaly detection,Mixture-of-unigrams model,Marine vehicles,natural language processing,security of data,trained model,generic anomaly detection,ships,automatic identification system,marine engineering,text mining,generative topic model,Training data,Data models,statistical outliers,intuitive method,Artificial intelligence,Training,text analysis,Probability,maritime surveillance data,learning (artificial intelligence),"
"density and mobility impact on manet routing protocols in a maritime environment","2015","Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks (MANETS) are multi hop wireless networks, where a packet hops through a number of intermediate nodes within coverage range of each other to reach the intended destination. The novel application of MANET routing protocols in the marine environment using available technology is one of the contributions of this work. The high cost of other available technologies which require direct connection to IP networks make our approach an attractive proposition for small craft. In this paper we investigate the effect of different maritime traffic patterns on the performance of three different MANET routing protocols which are Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV), Ad hoc On-Demand Multi Path Distance Vector (AOMDV) and Destination-Sequenced Distance Vector (DSDV). The traffic patterns are represented by different node densities and mobility behaviours which are likely to be found in the marine environment.

"water penetrating radar","2021","Ground penetrating radar (GPR) is a commonly-usedgeophysicaltechnique, yet the use of water-penetrating radar (WPR) has been less-well researched and published on. This is surprising, given the wide use of GPR on ice and the success of early aquatic experiments in the 1970s and 1980s. The past 15 years have seen advances in modes of antenna deployment, understanding of limiting environmental conditions and applications to geotechnical engineering (e.g. bridge support scour), siltation (e.g. sedimentation in reservoirs and flood-relief water-courses, sometimes due to climate change); location of sediment cores for palaeoecology; search and rescue operations and environmental crime (e.g. illegal dumping of waste in water). This manuscript will review the above, from common techniques through to typical applications with geotechnical engineering, archaeological and forensic case studies that demonstrate some of the surveys covered in the review.","Archaeology,Palaeoenvironments,Civil engineering,Radar,Forensic science,"
"contaminants in two west greenland caribou populations","2016","Two caribou populations in West Greenland were sampled and the kidneys, liver and muscle analyzed for contaminants, including aluminum, arsenic, cadmium, copper, lead, mercury, selenium and zinc. Although close in proximity, the two populations are topographically separated by an ice cap, which creates different climates and vegetation types in each region. Contaminant levels reflected the differing diets of the two caribou populations. To the south in the wetter lichen-rich region, caribou had significantly more aluminum, arsenic, cadmium, lead, mercury, selenium and zinc, likely due to atmospheric deposition on lichens. To the north in the dry desert steppe where grasses predominate, caribou had higher levels of copper. Cows collected in late winter had significantly less hepatic copper, lead and mercury if pregnant, indicating placental transfer of these elements. Our results suggest that hepatic copper levels <200μgg−1 dry weight may result in copper depletion in pregnant cows and hepatic mercury concentrations above 0.5μgg−1 dry weight may negatively affect fertility in caribou cows. Hepatic mercury levels were negatively correlated with cow body weight, suggesting an adverse effect on body condition. Element concentrations found in tissues from these caribou are not considered to be of a health concern for those consuming this traditional food.","Copper,Lead,Selenium,Mercury,Cadmium,Caribou,"

In order to assess the performance requirements and service level of the system, a concept for maritime PNT integrity monitoring is proposed, and the considerations necessary to meet performance requirements are summarized. Related studies are analyzed, and their limitations in monitoring the integrity of the satellite signals are presented.

"deep reinforcement learning based joint edge resource management in maritime network","2020","Due to the rapid development of the maritime networks, there has been a growing demand for computation-intensive applications which have various energy consumption, transmission bandwidth and computing latency requirements. Mobile edge computing (MEC) can efficiently minimize computational latency by offloading computation tasks by the terrestrial access network. In this work, we introduce a space-air-ground-sea integrated network architecture with edge and cloud computing components to provide flexible hybrid computing service for maritime service. In the integrated network, satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) provide the users with edge computing services and network access. Based on the architecture, the joint communication and computation resource allocation problem is modelled as a complex decision process, and a deep reinforcement learning based solution is designed to solve the complex optimization problem.

"a preliminary study on an optical system for nautical and maritime traffic monitoring","2021","The nautical traffic is very difficult to monitor since many vessels are not cooperative. VTSs (Vessel Traffic Systems) use several sources of information for estimating shipsâ€™ Position Navigation and Velocity, such as AIS (Automatic Identification System) and RADAR (RAdio Detection And Ranging); nevertheless, VTS areas do not cover the entire costal area of a country. In many cases the classification and identification of small non-AIS vessels could provide an important to the safety of navigation.Indeed, especially during the summer, the nautical tourism has a great impact on the maritime traffic congestion. The issue involves many institutions such as Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) and local maritime authorities which are not able to monitor the high volume of nautical traffic. This work introduces an optical system designed to monitor the traffic in small coastal areas based on images acquired by a single camera. The reliability and accuracy of the system is conditioned by the size of the pixel on the sea surface (Ground Sample Distance-GSD) and by the camera footprint area as well. More in detail, this work focuses on the detection of the best camera placement on the coast for optimizing the GSD size and obtaining the shape of camera footprint. The inspection was conducted on a target area of the MPA â€œPunta Campanellaâ€ located on the Sorrento coast.","Optical imaging,local maritime authorities,maritime traffic monitoring,VTS areas,marine radar,Vessel Traffic Systems,nautical tourism,Cameras,Sea measurements,Metrology-Photogrammetry-Maritime Traffic Monitoring,Radio navigation,radio detection and ranging,entire costal area,nonAIS vessel classification,-Low cost-,ships,marine safety,Automatic Identification System,AIS,cameras,Shape,Sea surface,maritime traffic congestion,nautical traffic monitoring,Optical variables measurement,optical system,Positioning-Navigation,coastal areas,camera footprint area,radionavigation,nonAIS vessel identification,"
"a novel approach to automate surrounding ships in a virtual maritime environment","2014","Full mission marine training scenarios are essential in training marine trainees with ship handling simulators. In a good training simulation not only the static environment but also the dynamic surrounding ships plays a major role in terms of behaviour realism. The surrounding ships also need to navigate according to COLREG (Convention on International Regulation for Preventing Collisions at Sea) navigational rules. This research presents a novel approach to automate the surrounding vessels in a marine simulation environment with a central controller to control the behaviours of each surrounding vessel in the marine environment. The controller uses positioning data of real ships which are derived from a set of historical Automatic Identification System (AIS) data and map the positioning data with the surrounding ships in virtual environment to obtain the navigation. An Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm is used to avoid the collisions by generating a new path when both trainee's ship and surrounding ships are in the vicinity of each other. The collision handling mechanism uses COLREG rules. The ACO algorithm generates successful collision avoided paths in all head-on, crossing and over-taking encountering situations. The number of turning points is used to measure the smoothness of the path and number of obstacles in the environment and number of nodes in the graph affects the smoothness of the path. With these results it is revealed that AIS data can be used as an assistant to automate surrounding vessels in a virtual maritime environment together with a proper collision avoidance mechanism.","head-on situations,collision handling mechanism,virtual maritime environment,ACO algorithm,crossing situations,virtual reality,ant colony optimization,target ships,ant colony optimisation,over-taking encountering situations,surrounding ships automation,marine navigation,Radio frequency,surrounding ships,ship handling simulators,ships,Automatic Identification System,AIS,surrounding vessels,Convention on International Regulation for Preventing Collisions at Sea,central controller,marine simulation environment,collision avoidance,Ant Colony Optimization (ACO),autonomous navigation,historical AIS data,COLREG navigational rules,"
"feasibility of investment in blue growth multiple-use of space and multi-use platform projects; results of a novel assessment approach and case studies","2019","Blue Growth is the creation of economic activity and jobs at sea, while multiple use of space makes efficient use of the available sea area by combining industries. Clearly there are many combinations and many value propositions. However, most technologies to date are considered blue sky concepts, with little robust techno-economic analysis demonstrating profitability. The paper begins by providing a comprehensive review of Blue Growth and multi-use in Blue Growth; both in policy as well as the wide range of current technologies, including ocean energy, offshore wind energy, offshore aquaculture and desalination. The Maribe H2020 project provides the vehicle for the research element of the paper. The major contribution is a new methodology for selecting, filtering, developing and ranking business propositions for multiple-use of space (MUS) and multi-use platforms (MUP). Application of the method for the first time identified three case studies where Blue Growth combination projects can be economically viable, with attractive internal rate of return (IRRs). Results presented for the case studies report standard investment metrics and show the relative contribution of each product (energy, food, water) to the system profitability, as well as socio-economic impact. Existing companies were fully engaged in the process. Co-creation between sector experts and industry led to both improved business value propositions and robust assessment of investment readiness. In contrast to the presumption that large scale platforms are commercially attractive, the highest ranking case study companies required smaller capital expenditure (CAPEX) and operated in niche subsectors. In conclusion, the positive economic performance of the case studies should provide confidence for the EC as well as investors that MUS and MUP have viable economic futures leading towards commercialisation. The macro and micro assessment methods will be particularly useful in other Blue Economy contexts and in other multiple product contexts.","Aquaculture,Multi-use platform,Blue Growth,Techno-economics,Multiple-use of space,Ocean energy,"
"multi-armed bandits learning for task offloading in maritime edge intelligence networks","2022","In the context of complex and dynamic marine environment, the offloading of computing tasks for ships of Internet of Things (IoT) users is a very challenging problem considering the different quality of service (QoS) requirements of maritime applications. Mobile edge computing driven by powerful computing capability and edge intelligence is taken as a promising solution, especially for the resource-constrained and delay-sensitive maritime IoT users. In this paper, we study the optimal edge server selection problem for ship IoT users to jointly minimize the latency and energy consumption for task offloading. Specifically, we first propose a novel space-air-ground-edge (SAGE) integrated maritime network architecture to offload computation-intensive IoT services at sea. Then, the latency and energy consumption of data transmission and processing during offloading are modelled. Based on the models, the edge server selection problem is formulated into a Multi-Armed Bandits learning problem, with considering the task latency requirement and energy budget. To achieve the optimal solution, a novel algorithm, referred to as UCB1-ESSS, is developed, which links the latency, energy consumption, and network constraints by introducing both reward and cost. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve considerably lower offloading latency and weighted latency-energy cost compared with the traditional algorithms under different QoS requirements, which proves the efficacy of theproposed algorithm.","edge intelligence,multi-armed bandits,resource-constrained,dynamic marine environment,data transmission,Internet of Things,Energy consumption,quality of service,Marine vehicles,Delays,ship IoT users,maritime edge intelligence networks,task latency requirement,powerful computing capability,energy budget,Things users,Servers,marine ship IoT users,cloud computing,MultiArmed Bandits,latency-energy cost,optimisation,mobile computing,mobile edge computing,network constraints,Computing offloading,computation-intensive IoT services,considerably lower offloading latency,maritime applications,complex environment,task offloading,energy consumption,optimal edge server selection problem,delay-sensitive maritime IoT users,computational complexity,maritime wireless networks,Computational modeling,optimal solution,Task analysis,Internet,learning (artificial intelligence),resource allocation,service requirements,novel space-air-ground-edge integrated maritime network architecture,"

"development of an unmanned aerial system for maritime environmental observation","2021","We developed an octocopter-based unmanned aerial system (UAS) to monitor remote environments. The system contains various environmental monitoring sensors for measuring wind speed/direction, temperature, relative humidity, atmospheric pressure, fine dust, and multispectral and RGB data. The UAS consists of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), a ground control station, and a server. We studied its electrical, mechanical, and software (SW) configurations. Specifically, we developed hardware (HW) and SW to control the yaw and gimbal pitch directions of the UAV conveying multispectral and RGB cameras. To prevent the obtained solar reflectance from affecting the multispectral and RGB data and to improve the quality of the obtained data, we maneuvered the yaw so that it would always deviate 135Â° from the solar azimuth angle, with the sun at its rear. Managing the yaw direction involves controlling the UAV based on a micro air vehicle link message-based robot operating system (ROS). To safely test the UAS performance before the maiden flight in an ocean area, we first evaluated PX4 and ROS-based SW through indoor software-in-the-loop simulation (SILS) via the Gazebo tool. Subsequently, we used an F450 UAV and an actual maritime UAV to sequentially perform pre-flight and flight experiments. This paper explains the system operation scenario, UAS component, and simulation and experimental results. The results reveal that the average yaw angle error during the mission,  $\bar {\left |{ \theta _{y,des}-\theta _{y} }\right |}$ , is approximately 8Â°, and the average pitch angle of the gimbal during the mission,  $\left |{ 50^{\circ }-\left |{ \bar {\theta _{c}} }\right | }\right |$ , is less than 5Â°.","ocean color,gimbal pitch directions,yaw pitch directions,yaw direction,robot operating system,remote sensing,UAS component,remote environments,Temperature measurement,F450 UAV,control engineering computing,maritime UAV,Sea measurements,environmental monitoring (geophysics),indoor software-in-the-loop simulation,ocean colour,Optical sensors,UAS performance,unmanned aerial vehicle,RGB cameras,ROS-based SW,cameras,unmanned aerial system,maritime environmental observation,sensors,environmental monitoring sensors,multispectral cameras,Real-time systems,atmospheric pressure,autonomous aerial vehicles,ground control station,pitch control (position),flight experiments,Unmanned aerial vehicles,helicopters,multispectral RGB data,mobile robots,Maritime environmental observation,Ocean temperature,solar azimuth angle,microair vehicle link message-based robot operating system,octocopter-based unmanned aerial system,Temperature sensors,solar reflectance,relative humidity,oceanographic techniques,"
"chapter 1 - resource conservation and management","2022","Mangroves are one of the most potential tidal wetlands characterized by their hydrological, ecological, and geological features. They form the diversified and biologically productive ecosystem, populated with heterogeneous groups of plant taxonomy. The transboundary Sundarban mangrove wetland (89°02′ to 89°55′E and 21°30′ to 22°30′N) is situated on the Ganges–Brahmaputra–Meghna river network. This represents the largest continuous tract of mangrove forest in the world, spanning across Bangladesh (62%) and India (38%). The chapter gives an illustrative account of the diversity and distribution patterns of mangroves in India and other coastal regions across the world, along with their anomalous biogeographical patterns, mangrove landform classification and their morphological structure and adaptation strategies. In addition, the mangrove ecosystem goods and services, carbon storage efficiency and application of remote sensing for mangrove mapping have been discussed. A haven for rich biodiversity, Sundarban harbors several rare and globally threatened plants and animals. The overall common key threats for mangrove ecosystems are land-use changes, overexploitation of natural resources, chemical pollution from point and diffusive sources, reduced freshwater supply and silt deposition. Both India and Bangladesh should implement bilateral monitoring programs to resolve those emerging problems and formulate necessary management strategies to restore this diversified and iconic mangrove ecosystem.","Sundarban wetland,tropical cyclone,endangered species,mangrove adaptation,overexploitation,mangroves,Biodiversity,"
"understanding global spatio-temporal trends and the relationship between vegetation greenness and climate factors by land cover during 1982–2014","2020","Analysis of the correlation between vegetation greenness and climate variable trends is important in the study of vegetation greenness. Our study used Normalized Difference Vegetation Index-3rd generation data from the Advanced Very High-Resolution Radiometer - Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies (AVHRR-GIMMS NDVI3g), land cover data from the Climate Change Initiative (CCI-LC), and climate data from the Climatic Research Unit global time series (CRU TS) of climate variables (temperature and precipitation, solar radiation) over the past 33 years. First, we estimated the overall trends for vegetation greenness and climate variables over five time periods. Second, we subjected the data to correlation, regression, and residual analyses to detect correlations between vegetation greenness and different climate variables. Third, we extracted trends and correlation results by primary land cover types for each climate zone. Our study was focused at the global scale, and findings indicate that the largest decreasing trend of vegetation greenness and grasslands occurred in the mid-latitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere and in parts of South America, Africa, Saudi Arabia, and south and northeast Asia. In particular, the cold climatic zones of forest (36.6%), cropland (36.6%), and grassland (14.1%) suffered significant decline in vegetation greenness. Anthropogenic activities are mainly responsible for declining vegetation greenness particularly in northern Africa, central and western Asia. However, residual analysis shows an increase in vegetation greenness in some parts of western Europe, southern Australia, and the northern part of South America. The study also identified temperature and precipitation as the main factors responsible for controlling vegetation growth. Hot-spot areas with the largest temperature increases were found in the Amazon, Central America, southern Greenland, east Africa, south-east Asia, and other areas. However, temperatures decreased in the western part of South America, Angola, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Papua New Guinea. Precipitation decreased the most from March to May over most parts of the world with high correlation (r = 0.88) in Russia Canada, northeast Asia, and central Africa. In general, climate factors were the principal drivers of the variation in vegetation greenness globally in recent years.","Vegetation greenness trends,Land cover,Correlation,Precipitation,Global,Temperature,"

Empirical distributions on how early ships tend to perform avoidance maneuvers and how close they tend to come are evaluated. These are used by the intention model to identify when a shipâ€™s behavior is outside normal behavior. Running the intention model on the historical ship encounters demonstrates that the intention model is able to correctly infer the intentions of ships in real collision encounters. The model is able to distinguish between different types of incompliant behavior such as a ship not giving way when it should, the wrong ship giving way, or a ship giving way in the wrong direction.

"development and deployment of multi-mission intelligent autonomous maritime systems","2020","Cherokee Nation Strategic Programs (CNSP) and Ocean Aero, Inc. have teamed together to demonstrate the multi-mission capabilities of commercial autonomous maritime systems. CNSP has a proven record testing, fielding, and developing Unmanned Systems (UxS) programs across air, ground, and maritime domains. Ocean Aero has developed a portfolio of intelligent autonomous underwater and surface vehicles that are uniquely engineered for a wide range of applications above and below the ocean surface. The focus of our collaboration is the accelerated deployment of autonomous capabilities in operational mission scenarios. Unmanned systems are demonstrating daily value to commercial and civilian users today. Drones are rapidly moving beyond powerful remotely controlled information capture tools into advanced networks of aerial robots providing services and access that was never before considered valuable. Ground robot technologies are maturing just as rapidly and taking on many different forms as purpose-built systems are enabling subterranean exploration, driver safety on interstate highways, and disaster response support. Maritime systems are now fulfilling the same potential with robust, all-weather designs that enable long endurance, rugged missions for marine users. The operational value that these systems provide comes from the advancements in intelligent autonomy. We are currently testing the range of autonomous capabilities of the Ocean Aero Triton Series autonomous underwater and surface vehicle systems at the University of Southern Mississippi Marine Research Center (USM MRC). The Ocean Aero vehicles are designed and built with autonomous, persistent navigation capabilities as a standard feature. Additional customized, mission-centric sensors may be added to the systems to accomplish specific operational tasks and/or increase autonomous performance. The command-and-control (C2) communication architecture provides situational awareness and mission progress monitoring for the onboard vehicle decision-making, as well as the remote operator control station. To successfully achieve the high level of autonomous operations in locations without terrestrial communications (cellular) and beyond visual line of sight, UxS use satellite communications for navigation and mission data transfer. Our testing is evaluating the ability of the autonomous systems to accomplish multiple missions, including perimeter security, tracking of other surface vehicles, environmental monitoring, and marine science missions. These evaluations include the performance of the vehicles, the sensors, and the multi-domain communication systems, while characterizing the operating conditions for each test series. â€œAutonomyâ€ is a capability that means different things to different people. Our testing at the MRC is evaluating the ability of the system to react to new information, whether from external source or self-perceived, to accomplish the intended mission, such as detection of an unknown vehicle in the area. This ability to react includes concepts such as dynamic replanning for navigation, as well as communications with the operations center for mission management awareness. Through these communications and activities, we are measuring the operator workloads in multiple missions to determine if the autonomy in the system is increasing, decreasing, or improving operator performance. Our testing team was assembled specifically to accomplish these objectives. The full technical paper will include sample test cases and data collection examples for evaluating the Ocean Aero autonomous underwater and surface vehicle technologies using the Cherokee Nation Capabilities-Based Assessment process. This is the proven, repeatable process that we have used for evaluating air, ground, and maritime unmanned systems for many customers. We use this process for assessing the operational performance of mature products, not research-only test units. This focus on technologies that are commercially available or at least products from an active production line, allow us to evaluate capabilities as they relate to mission requirements and user objectives. We have the team with the experience, the equipment, the facilities, and the dedication to advance the expectations of what is possible for unmanned maritime systems.

The manoeuvring is a trajectory tracking control system. The adopted method is combination of a recursive estimation procedure with an appropriate control law. In order to do the maritime search and rescue mission, the reference trajectory generated by the guidance system is computed based on the way-point, light-of-sight and exponential decay techniques and standard search patterns suggested by International Maritime Organization (IMO). The manoeuvring system has time-varying coefficients that are estimated by an online estimation identification procedure, and time-varying control gains determined by the optimal control law. Therefore, the manoeuvring system can adapt well to changes of environmental disturbances and do the tasks of maritime search and rescue mission at rough seas.","exponential decay technique,Vehicle dynamics,online estimation identification procedure,Marine vehicles,optimal control,Optimal control,environmental disturbance,time-varying coefficient/control gain,optimal control law,marine safety,Accidents,International Maritime Organization,position control,recursive optimal manoeuvring system,maritime search,recursive estimation procedure,way-point technique,standard search pattern,Australia,Recursive estimation,IMO,marine control system,Automatic control,light-of-sight technique,Control systems,Computational modeling,sea rescue mission,recursive estimation,tracking,trajectory tracking control/guidance system,Control theory,"
"a cloud based architecture capable of perceiving and predicting multiple vessel behaviour","2015","Progressively huge amounts of data, tracking vessels during their voyages across the seas, are becoming available, mostly due to the automatic identification system (AIS) that vessels of specific categories are required to carry. These datasets provide detailed insights into the patterns vessels follow, while safely navigating across the globe, under various conditions. In this paper, we develop an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) capable of predicting a vessels future behaviour (position, speed and course), based on events that occur in a predictable pattern, across large map areas. The main concept of this study is to determine if an ANN is capable of inferring the unique behavioural patterns that each vessel follows and successively use this as a means for predicting multiple vessel behaviour into a future point in time. We design, train and implement a proof of concept ANN, as a cloud based web application, with the ability of overlaying predicted short and long term vessel behaviour on an interactive map. Our proposed approach could potentially assist in busy port scheduling, vessel route planning, anomaly detection and increasing overall Maritime Domain Awareness.","Vessel behaviour prediction,Soft computing applications,Artificial Neural Network,Automated identification system,Maritime Domain Awareness,"

"gnss integrity concepts for maritime users","2019","Some of the most important parameters of operational requirements for Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) are integrity, continuity, accuracy, availability and coverage. These requirements, most strictly formalized in aviation, are based on risk analysis, considering risk exposure time and critical risk exposure time. However, the GNSS user requirements in maritime domain are still not clearly set. GNSS offers worldwide coverage at a sufficient position data quality and though other means of ship's position fixing are available at sea, the use of GNSS devices is generally the most preferred method of producing valid position data. Primary means for electronic position fixing currently in use in majority of merchant ships are shipborne autonomous GPS receivers or DGPS IALA receivers. More advanced GNSS receivers able to process signals from GPS, GLONASS, Chinese Beidou, European Galileo, regional Indian IRNSS, and satellite based augmentation systems (SBAS) are still rare. But it is expected that such combined or multi-system receivers will soon become more common in maritime transport.To be prepared for a malfunction of any GNSS devices for maritime applications and e-Navigation specifically, their state of the art integrity monitoring should be developed and standardized analogously to other transport domains. The issues of existing requirements, performance standards, and future concepts of maritime GNSS integrity are discussed in this paper.","satellite based augmentation systems,operational requirements,integrity monitoring,GNSS,Radio navigation,Receivers,Standards,electronic position fixing,e-Navigation,maritime GNSS integrity,Monitoring,integrity,Global Navigation Satellite System,PNT,Global navigation satellite system,marine navigation,Global Positioning System,maritime users,"
"continuous monitoring scheduling for moving targets by earth observation satellites","2023","The studies of earth observation satellite (EOS) scheduling for stationary targets have been increasing rapidly in recent years. However, these studies ignore EOS scheduling for moving targets (EOSSMT), which is urgently needed in many situations. EOSSMT is more complicated due to two factors, 1) location prediction of the moving targets and 2) algorithm design of EOSSMT optimization model for highly-nonlinear characteristics. In this article, we present a novel continuous monitoring scheduling methodology for moving targets by EOSs. Firstly, in order to predict the location of moving targets, a prediction-capture method, which can calculate the capture probability (CP) of the targets, is proposed. Then, based on the concept CP, we regard the EOSSMT as a stochastic integer nonlinear programming problem. Aiming to maximize observation times and duration, two objective functions with low complexity are proposed correspondingly. Finally, to solve our highly-nonlinear optimization model more efficiently, a dispersion-based heuristic (DBH) is proposed. In the computational experiments, a number of instances (scenarios), in which moving targets are successfully observed, verify the correctness and efficiency of our novel methodology for EOSSMT. Computational experiments also show that DBH can achieve better results than the Genetic Algorithm and Greedy Algorithm, with significantly less algorithm complexity.","EOS scheduling,Moving targets,Dispersion-based heuristic,Earth observation satellites,Integer nonlinear programming,"
"a comprehensive maritime benchmark dataset for detection, tracking and threat recognition","2021","This paper describes a new multimodal maritime dataset recorded using a multispectral suite of sensors, including AIS, GPS, radar, and visible and thermal cameras. The visible and thermal cameras are mounted on the vessel itself and surveillance is performed around the vessel in order to protect it from piracy at sea. The dataset corresponds to a series of acted scenarios which simulate attacks to the vessel by small, fast-moving boats (â€˜skiffsâ€™). The scenarios are inspired by real piracy incidents at sea and present a range of technical challenges to the different stages in an automated surveillance system: object detection, object tracking, and event recognition (in this case, threats towards the vessel). The dataset can thus be employed for training and testing at several stages of a threat detection and classification system. We also present in this paper baseline results that can be used for benchmarking algorithms performing such tasks. This new dataset fills a lack of publicly available datasets for the development and testing of maritime surveillance applications.","comprehensive maritime benchmark dataset,Benchmark testing,visible cameras,Thermal sensors,Sensor phenomena and characterization,computer crime,multimodal maritime dataset,thermal cameras,classification system,automated surveillance system,object tracking,cameras,object detection,image classification,Radar,marine engineering computing,event recognition,maritime surveillance applications,Boats,Object detection,Surveillance,video surveillance,threat recognition,threat detection,piracy incidents,"
"bistatic sar maritime ship target 3-d image reconstruction method without distortion in local cartesian coordinate","2023","Bistatic synthetic aperture radar (BiSAR) has been attracting worldwide attention because of its forward-looking imaging and high anti-interference. In harsh environment, it is vital for BiSAR to conduct extensive surveillance, imaging, and recognition of maritime ship targets. However, under the disturbance of sea waves, the ship target has an unknown and massive 3-D rotation, so that its imaging projection plane (IPP) is also undetermined. Thus, high-dimensional random distortion appears in imaging results, making it difficult to recognize the target through 2-D distorted images effectively. To solve these problems, BiSAR maritime ship target 3-D image reconstruction method without distortion in local Cartesian coordinate (LCC) is proposed. In this article, according to positions of scatterers and rotation parameters, significant differences of different scatterers of maritime ship targets have been found in bistatic range, Doppler centroid (DC), and Doppler frequency rate (DFR), which lays a solid foundation for the scatterer separation of ship targets. On this basis, a 3-D R-DC-DFR domain is constructed, and 2-D echoes of the maritime ship target are projected into R-DC-DFR domain to separate scatterers. Then, by remapping data of transmitter and receiver in R-DC-DFR domain to LCC, as well as evaluating their similarity metric, the optimal rotation parameters of the ship target can be obtained via the maximal similarity. Therefore, the image distortion caused by the unknown IPP has been removed, and 3-D image reconstruction of ship targets can be realized without distortion in the LCC. Furthermore, to evaluate performances of 3-D image reconstruction for different rotation parameters and bistatic configurations, 3-D reconstruction index is proposed and analyzed. Both point-targets and maritime ship targets are simulated to emphasize the effectiveness of the proposed method.","local Cartesian coordinate,bistatic synthetic aperture radar (BiSAR),marine radar,R-DC-DFR domain,Image reconstruction,maritime ship target,Marine vehicles,bistatic SAR maritime ship target 3-D image reconstruction method,high-dimensional random distortion,Transmitters,Synthetic aperture radar,geophysical image processing,3-D reconstruction,ships,synthetic aperture radar,image distortion,image reconstruction,radar imaging,Doppler effect,BiSAR maritime ship target,2-D distorted images,imaging projection plane,Receivers,Imaging,point-targets,remote sensing by radar,local Cartesian coordinate (LCC),oceanographic techniques,"
"correlation of late quaternary moraines: impact of climate variability, glacier response, and chronological resolution","2012","The last decade has seen a global surge in the number and resolution of well-dated geomorphological reconstructions of mountain glacier fluctuations and former ice sheet extents. This has been facilitated by the widespread deployment of large samples of terrestrial cosmogenic nuclide dating (TCND) allowing more sophisticated probability analyses for reducing the statistical uncertainty of moraine ages, and testing of correlations at local, regional and hemispheric scales. Geochronological advances in the field, laboratory and on model calibration have taken place in parallel with modelling of palaeoclimate based on glacier reconstructions, and of glacier sensitivity to temperature and precipitation forcing. In spite of these advances, basic conceptual issues remain. This review questions whether the technical leap forward in dating has encouraged us to over-reach our interpretive limits, particularly in terms of the concept and practice of correlation. We propose that to enable reliable correlation, glacier chronologies should first be examined for their climatic integrity, spatial coherence, and chronological robustness. Even with excellent dating, interpretive complexity remains due to complex climate signals and glacier response characteristics, and to erosion censoring of the landform record. All are issues which must be addressed to avoid either spurious “lumping” (correlation) or “splitting” (differentiation) of glacier chronologies, and thus misinterpretation of the climatic significance of reconstructed glacier advances. We suggest that the reliability of correlation is no better than the weakest link in the chain of reasoning which connects climatic fluctuations with dated landforms and sediments. Improved dating means that poor chronological resolution is less likely to be the limiting factor for correlation, but shifts the focus onto other less quantifiable sources of uncertainty. These conceptual statements are exemplified with reference to Holocene glacial chronologies of contrasting mid-latitude environments in southern Norway, Iceland and New Zealand.","Dating techniques,Glacial chronology,Quaternary,Glacial geomorphology,Correlation,Holocene,Moraines,Climate change,Geochronology,"
"performance evaluation of maritime vdes networks with opnet simulator","2018","VHF Data Exchange System (VDES) is a wireless communication system between ships and shore stations in a marine environment. Recently, a standardization of VHF Data Exchange (VDE) to provide information and multimedia data exchange between ships and shore stations is underway. Unlike the conventional communication networks, the communication quality of marine networks is influenced by the height of the sea wave, the height of the shore stations, and the density and location of ships. In this paper, we propose how to utilize the VDE channels and a communication protocol such as Multiple Incremental Time Division Multiple Access (MITDMA) and Fixed Access Time Division Multiple Access (FATDMA) in order to implement the operation of ships and shore stations defined in the standard.

"principal component thermography for flaw contrast enhancement and flaw depth characterisation in composite structures","2002","This study reports on the application of principal component thermography to the nondestructive inspection of composite structures. The technique is based on a singular value decomposition of the measured response to pulsed thermal excitation as applied in the course of a normal flash thermographic inspection. Trials on synthetically generated data show evidence of excellent noise-rejection qualities which manifest high levels of flaw contrast relative to that present in the unprocessed data. A simple analytical expression is then derived that relates a characteristic time furnished by the decomposition to the flaw depth, providing a basis for flaw depth estimation. This framework is shown to provide flaw-depth estimates with good levels of precision and robustness. Finally, application to experimental data is considered. An AS4/3501 composite laminate sample containing an assortment of teflon inserts is subject to active thermographic inspection and the response data analysed using the proposed approach. The results conclusively demonstrate the practical efficacy of the approach, and confirm the attractive properties outlined in relation to the numerical tests.",""
"origin of harmattan dust settled in northern ghana — long transported or local dust?","2011","The Harmattan is a dry, dust-laden continental wind which has its origin in the Bodélé Depression in the Chad basin. In Ghana the Harmattan can be experienced from November to March, when the Harmattan replaces the dominant south westerly maritime Monsoon wind. The hypothesis of this study is that the majority of dust deposited in northern Ghana may not be from the original Harmattan source in the Bodélé Depression. The aim of this study is therefore to investigate the origin of deposited dust in Tamale, Ghana. This is examined by comparing wind data, grain size distribution, mineralogical and geochemical data from dust samples deposited during the Harmattan and Monsoon seasons, and topsoil. This study shows that despite a clear difference between the wind directions in the Harmattan and Monsoon seasons in Tamale, northern Ghana, no distinct differences are observed between the mineral or elemental compositions of the bulk dust samples. Traces of minerals in the clay fraction of the Harmattan period dust may have their origin in the Bodélé Depression or other saline environments. The Harmattan dust deposited in Ghana shows only little resemblance to dust from the Chad basin and with Harmattan dust deposited in Niger. This study therefore suggests that the dust deposited during the Harmattan period in northern Ghana is not under significant influence of sediments from the Bodélé Depression. Similarity in the mineral and elemental composition of the dust from both the Harmattan and Monsoon periods indicates that the dusts settled are mainly of local origin.","West Africa,Harmattan,Elemental composition,Mineralogy composition,Mineral dust,"

"satellite detection of increasing northern hemisphere non-frozen seasons from 1979 to 2008: implications for regional vegetation growth","2012","The landscape freeze–thaw (FT) signal from satellite microwave remote sensing is closely linked to vegetation phenology and land–atmosphere trace gas exchange where seasonal frozen temperatures are a major constraint to plant growth. We applied a temporal change classification of 37GHz brightness temperature (Tb) series from the Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR) and Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) to classify daily FT status over global land areas where seasonal frozen temperatures influence ecosystem processes. A temporally consistent, long-term (30year) FT record was created, ensuring cross-sensor consistency through pixel-wise adjustment of the SMMR Tb record based on empirical analyses of overlapping SMMR and SSM/I measurements. The resulting FT record showed mean annual spatial classification accuracies of 91 (+/−8.6) and 84 (+/−9.3) percent for PM and AM overpass retrievals relative to in situ air temperature measurements from the global weather station network. The FT results were compared against other measures of biosphere activity including CO2 eddy flux tower measurements and satellite (MODIS) vegetation greenness (NDVI). The FT defined non-frozen season largely bounds the period of active vegetation growth and net ecosystem CO2 uptake for tower sites representing major biomes. Earlier spring thawing and longer non-frozen seasons generally benefit vegetation growth inferred from NDVI spring and summer growth anomalies where the non-frozen season is less than approximately 6months, with greater benefits at higher (>45°N) latitudes. A strong (P<0.001) increasing (0.189daysyr−1) trend in the Northern Hemisphere mean annual non-frozen season is largely driven by an earlier (−0.149daysyr−1) spring thaw trend and coincides with a 0.033°Cyr−1 regional warming trend. The FT record also shows a positive (0.199daysyr−1) trend in the number of transitional (AM frozen and PM non-frozen) frost days, which coincide with reduced vegetation productivity inferred from tower CO2 and MODIS NDVI measurements. The relative benefits of earlier and longer non-frozen seasons for vegetation growth under global warming may be declining due to opposing increases in disturbance, drought and frost damage related impacts.","ESDR,NDVI,CDR,Freeze thaw,SSM/I,Vegetation growing season,Phenology,SMMR,NASA MEaSUREs,Global warming,MODIS,Climate change,"
"augmented ship tracking under occlusion conditions from maritime surveillance videos","2020","Ship tracking provides crucial on-site microscopic kinematic traffic information which benefits maritime traffic flow analysis, ship safety enhancement, traffic control, etc., and thus has attracted considerable research attentions in the maritime surveillance community. Conventional ship tracking methods yield satisfied results by exploring distinct visual ship features in maritime images, which may fail when the target ship is partially or fully sheltered by obstacles (e.g., ships, waves, etc.) in maritime videos. To overcome the difficulty, we propose an augmented ship tracking framework via the kernelized correlation filter (KCF) and curve fitting algorithm. First, the KCF model is introduced to track ships in the consecutive maritime images and obtain raw ship trajectory dataset. Second, the data anomaly detection and rectification procedure are implemented to rectify the contaminated ship positions. For the purpose of performance evaluation, we implement the proposed framework and another three popular ship tracking models on the four typical ship occlusion videos. The experimental results show that our proposed framework successfully tracks ships in maritime video clips with high accuracy (i.e., the average root mean square error (RMSE), root mean square percentage error (RMSPE), mean absolute deviation (MAD) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) are less than 10), which significantly outperforms the other popular ship trackers.","Smart ship,maritime surveillance videos,Marine vehicles,Feature extraction,maritime traffic flow analysis,augmented ship tracking,ship trajectory dataset,on-site microscopic kinematic traffic information,visual ship features,Videos,kernelized correlation filter,object tracking,ships,marine safety,marine engineering,Target tracking,object detection,feature extraction,maritime images,Correlation,curve fitting algorithm,image filtering,video signal processing,Training,curve fitting,ship occlusion videos,data anomaly detection,Visualization,traffic control,ship occlusion,traffic engineering computing,ship safety enhancement,video surveillance,visual ship tracking,"

"hybrid satellite-uav-terrestrial maritime networks: network selection for users on a vessel optimized with transmit power and uav position","2022","The hybrid satellite-UAV-terrestrial maritime networks have shown great promise for broadband coverage at sea.

In practice, users on a vessel can be collaboratively served by an ABS and a vessel-enabled base station (VBS) in different networks. In this case, how to select the network for users on a vessel is still an open issue. In this paper, a TBS and a satellite respectively provide wireless backhaul for the ABS and the VBS.

"smoke aerosol transport patterns over the maritime continent","2013","Smoke transport patterns over the Maritime Continent (MC) are studied through a combination of approaches, including a) analyzing AODs obtained from satellite products; b) aerosol transport modeling with AOD assimilation along with the atmospheric flow patterns; c) analyzing smoke wet deposition distributions; and d) examining forward trajectories for smoke events defined in this study. It is shown that smoke transport pathways are closely related to the low-level atmospheric flow, i.e., during June–Sept, smoke originating from the MC islands with a dominant source over central and southern Sumatra, and southern and western Borneo, is generally transported northwestward south of the equator and northeastward north of the equator with the cross-equatorial flow, to the South China Sea (SCS), the Philippines and even further to the western Pacific. During the October–November transitional period, smoke transport paths are more zonally oriented compared to June–September. Smoke originating from Java, Bali, Timor etc, and southern New Guinea, which are in the domain of easterlies and southeasterlies during the boreal summer (June–November), is generally transported westward. It is also found that smoke transport over the MC exhibits multi-scale variability. Smoke typically lives longer and can be transported farther in El Niño years and later MJO phases compared with non El Niño years and earlier MJO phases. During El Niño periods there is much stronger westward transport to the east tropical Indian Ocean. Finally, orographic effect on smoke transport over the MC is also clearly discernable.","Aerosol transport,Smoke,El Niño,MJO,Smoke transport,Maritime Continent,"
"multi-radio multi-channel assignment algorithm in maritime wireless mesh networks","2019","The recent growth in the maritime industry stemming to increase in global commerce as well as searching for hydrocarbons at offshore locations, the high data rate and cost affordable maritime communication is acquired. A mesh network is envisaged for maritime communications because of its expanded coverage, self-healing, and high-capacity. With the development of multi-radio technology, the frequency interference can be decreased sharply with proper channel assignment. The static channel assignment optimization is often applied to decrease the wireless frequency interference which is known as an NP-hard problem. In this paper, we focus on the static channel assignment issue and propose a heuristic algorithm to solve the optimization problem. The problem is addressed by assigning channels to communication links to minimize the interference from overall network. A modified particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is proposed to optimize the problem, and a new merging solution is adopted to reassign channels for nodes, which violate the radio constraints.

"spatio-temporal analysis of lightning activity over greece — preliminary results derived from the recent state precision lightning network","2014","Lightning is a natural phenomenon in the atmosphere, being a major cause of storm related deaths, main trigger of forest fires and affects many electrochemical systems of the body. Significant scientific interest has come up in the last decades, as numerous lightning detection networks have been established in operational basis, providing lightning data to assess and mitigate lightning impact to the local society by spatio-temporal analysis. In this study, a preliminary analysis of spatial and temporal variabilities of recorded lightnings over Greece during the period from January 2008 to December 2009 is presented. The data for retrieving the location and time-of-occurrence (TOA) of lightning were acquired from the Hellenic National Meteorological Service (HNMS). An operational precision lightning network (PLN) has been established since 2007 by HNMS, consisting of eight time-of-arrival (TOA) sensors, spatially distributed across Greek territory. The spatial variability of lightnings revealed their incidence within specific geographical sub-regions while the temporal variability concerns the seasonal and monthly distributions. All the analyses were carried out with respect to cloud to cloud (CC), cloud to ground (CG) and ground to cloud (GC) lightnings, within the examined time period.

"a novel antenna tracking technique for maritime broadband communication (maricomm) system","2015","Maritime communication is internationally protected because closely related to the maritime safety, and it has evolved slower than terrestrial communication technologies. However, with the recent rapid advances in communication technology, maritime communications have become faster and increasingly modernized. A maritime broadband wireless data communication (MariComm) system was developed to make two-way high-speed internet/multimedia services available at a rate of 1 Mbps or more on the sea by extending the communication coverage of terrestrial wireless communications networks to sea areas. The MariComm system uses high-gain directional antennas to extend the transmission range and has multiple directional antennas to cover 360 degrees in azimuth. In this paper, we introduce a directional antenna tracking technique and apparatus using received RF signal and ship location information in the MariComm system.","terrestrial wireless communications networks,maritime broadband communication system,antenna tracking technique,Antenna measurements,high-gain directional antennas,Marine vehicles,directive antennas,Communication,ship location information,Directive antennas,Wireless communication,Maritime,Directional antennas,received RF signal,Wireless LAN,Wireless,Broadband,Broadband communication,multimedia services,two-way high-speed Internet services,wireless data communication system,marine communication,MariComm,Antenna Tracking,"
"the 19 january 2013 windstorm over the north atlantic: large-scale dynamics and impacts on iberia","2014","On 19 January 2013 Portugal was once again on an extreme meteorological risk warning state due to the landfall of a rapidly deepening low pressure system exactly on the period of its maximum explosive development. This storm, named Gong, had a central minimum pressure of 968hPa, observed wind gusts of 140kmh−1 on some locations of the Portuguese coast and was responsible for the downfall of thousands of trees on some of the Portuguese national forests, the destruction of several hundred farms among other huge socioeconomic losses and fatalities. The large-scale synoptic conditions and dynamical characteristics of windstorm Gong, as well as the associated meteorological and socioeconomic adverse impacts are reviewed in this paper. For this purpose an objective lagrangean method, which identifies and follows individual lows, is applied for the assessment of the cyclone track and lifetime characteristics, which is complemented by the analysis of several thermohydrodynamical reanalysis fields during the lifetime of the cyclone. Results show that Gong underwent an explosive development with ‘bomb’ characteristics between the Azores and the Iberian Peninsula, with a deepening rate unusually high for these latitudes. The rapid deepening of Gong was supported by the southerly displacement of the polar jet stream; by a pronounced cyclonic potential vorticity streamer which approached Iberia from northwest; and by the presence of an atmospheric river over the western and central subtropical North Atlantic converging into Gong׳s genesis region and then crossing the Atlantic basin, moving along with the storm towards Iberia. Understanding the dynamics of these high impact extreme events may be of relevance in view of improving extreme forecasts as well as of public awareness, policy making and risk assessment and management of severe weather in Portugal.","Explosive cyclogenesis,Atmospheric river,Wind and precipitation extremes,Windstorm,Natural hazards,Iberia,"
"routeminer: mining ship routes from a massive maritime trajectories","2014","Mining trajectory data has been attracting significant interest in the last years. By analyzing trajectory data, we are able to discover the movement behavior and location-aware knowledge, and then develop many interesting applications such as movement behavior discovery, location prediction, traffic analysis, and so on. However, trajectory data mining is a challenge task because of the trajectory data is available with uncertainty. Furthermore, discovering the valuable knowledge from maritime trajectory is made even more difficult due to the maritime area is a free moving space. Unlike the vehicles' movements are constrained by road networks, there is no such a sea route for ships to follow in maritime area. A ship's movement may not exactly repeat the same trajectory even the ship has the similar movement behavior with others. In this work, Route Miner system provides a framework of ship route mining for maritime traffic analysis. Given a set of ship trajectories in a maritime area, Route Miner explore the movement behavior from those massive trajectories in a free moving space. Then, ship routes are detected based on those behavioral pattern. Finally, the system generates a set of ships routes to provide operators a better understanding from ship trajectory data. We conduct the experiments on real maritime trajectories to show the effectiveness of proposed Route Miner. In the future, Route Miner is going to serve as the photo type for exploring the solutions of the challenges those related to anomaly detection and traffic management in the maritime domain.","data mining,Vectors,movement behavior,anomaly detection,Marine vehicles,movement behavior discovery,traffic management,ship trajectories,Trajectory Data Mining,mining ship routes,ship route mining,Ship Route Mining,marine systems,maritime trajectories,Vehicles,trajectory data analysis,route miner system,Maritime Trajectory,trajectory data mining,maritime domain,behavioral pattern,maritime traffic analysis,Roads,location prediction,Trajectory,massive maritime trajectories,Uncertainty,road networks,Data mining,maritime area,location-aware knowledge,"
"maritime hacking using land-based skills","2022","Todayâ€™s maritime shipping traffic remains remarkably vulnerable to land cyberattacks due to corporate avoidance of expensive upgrades and maintenance, a lack of skill across the maritime shipping industry, critical maritime chokepoints as ambush locations, and an engrained tendency to view the sea as buffering shipping from land-based threats. When the huge container ship, Ever Given, ran aground in the Suez Canal in March 2021, cyberattacks on the navigation were suspected. Though suspicions were unproven, the effects of the weeklong blockage were global, creating a security warning for national defense professionals. The lesson from the incident is clear â€“ the maritime industry is full of chokepoints that can be economically damaging if exploited. The event also offered a widely covered demonstration event for adversaries seeking future leverage in disruption campaigns. Another demonstration occurred when the winning team at Augustâ€™s 2021 DefCon â€œHack the Seaâ€ event hacked replica maritime control systems without the knowledge of ship operational technology. This essay argues that both occurrences are the latest to enhance the recognition of means and opportunity by motivated adversaries.

"efficient energy and delay tradeoff for vessel communications in sdn based maritime wireless networks","2021","The maritime communication network is assembled by emergent network technologies. However, the adverse maritime environment impedes the efficiency of resources allocation in maritime communication network. Here we show a joint sleeping scheduling and opportunistic transmission scheme in delay-tolerant maritime wireless communication networks based on software defined networking (SDN) to find a better tradeoff between the energy consumption and the delay. Specifically, an energy-limited delay tolerant networking (DTN) node deployed in the ocean receives/transmits data from/to vessels within its communication range. To further save the energy, a long-term energy minimization problem is formulated with sleeping scheduling and opportunistic transmission. After that, a multi-objective minimization problem of energy and delay is first modeled by Lyapunov optimization (LO), which then is solved by convex optimization. Both mathematical analyses and simulation results demonstrate how the maritime communication network allocates satisfactorily with the proposed allocation scheme.","opportunistic transmission scheme,telecommunication power management,adverse maritime environment,minimisation,network technologies,Energy consumption,convex programming,Delays,vessel communications,joint sleeping scheduling,Resource management,Lyapunov methods,Sun,telecommunication scheduling,SDN based maritime wireless networks,efficient energy tradeoff,multiobjective minimization problem,Communication networks,software defined networks,software defined networking,SDN,Software defined networks,convex optimization,radio networks,delay tradeoff,delay tolerant networking,Optimization,mathematical analysis,communication range,delay tolerant networks,Minimization,marine communication,long-term energy minimization problem,energy conservation,DTN node,Lyapunov optimization,delay-energy tradeoff,delays,resource allocation,delay-tolerant maritime wireless communication networks,"
"uses and misuses of the automatic identification system","2019","The Automatic Identification System (AIS) is widely used by mariners at sea as a compulsory collision prevention device on-board. Since the inception of collaborative platforms that gather AIS messages received by a network of stations, large worldwide AIS datasets can be assembled and enable a series of analyses of the maritime traffic, including an increase of the maritime domain awareness, the assessment and prediction of trajectories, the detection of anomalies, the measurement of fishing pressure, vessel-born noise and air pollution and the global modelling of the maritime traffic. However a series of misuses of the AIS does exist, and data may lack reliability as some users broadcast errors or intentionally falsify the information sent by the device. In this respect, a methodology to assess the integrity and veracity of AIS messages has been developed, leading to the determination of maritime risks in support to maritime monitoring activities.

"seasonal oceanographic changes and their implications for the abundance of small pelagic fishes in the southern south china sea","2022","The seasonal variations in shelf circulation and their implications for the distribution of light fishing vessels positions (VBD) that capture small pelagic fishes in the southern South China Sea (SSCS) are investigated by using multi-datasets between 2008–2014. It is found that the SSCS shelf circulation is indicated by the strong seasonal reversal western boundary current (WBC) and prominent cyclonic circulation (eddy). The southeastward WBC brings homogeneous salty, colder, and high primary production of nanophytoplankton (PPN) water during winter-time from the northern and the cyclonic eddy region into the southern SSCS. In contrast, less salty, warmer, and less PPN are advected northwestward from Karimata into the northern region. These factors significantly influence the distribution of VBD and in turn the production of captured small pelagic fishes (CPUE), revealing two maxima (peaks) of both VBD and CPUE during the monsoon breaks (MB) with a time-lag of 2–3 month from the monsoon peaks. Relationship between oceanographic parameters and CPUE is examined statistically revealing that ocean current and PPN are significantly affect the CPUE. A relatively high PPN and strong current during the peaks of monsoon are correlated with lower CPUE. In contrast, during the MBs period CPUE maxima are associated with a relatively weak ocean current and consumed PPN that favor the abundance of small pelagic fishes.","Small pelagic fishes,Southern South China Sea,Light fishing vessels,Oceanographic parameters,"
"chapter four - the coral sea: physical environment, ecosystem status and biodiversity assets","2013","The Coral Sea, located at the southwestern rim of the Pacific Ocean, is the only tropical marginal sea where human impacts remain relatively minor. Patterns and processes identified within the region have global relevance as a baseline for understanding impacts in more disturbed tropical locations. Despite 70 years of documented research, the Coral Sea has been relatively neglected, with a slower rate of increase in publications over the past 20 years than total marine research globally. We review current knowledge of the Coral Sea to provide an overview of regional geology, oceanography, ecology and fisheries. Interactions between physical features and biological assemblages influence ecological processes and the direction and strength of connectivity among Coral Sea ecosystems. To inform management effectively, we will need to fill some major knowledge gaps, including geographic gaps in sampling and a lack of integration of research themes, which hinder the understanding of most ecosystem processes.","Food web,Pristine ecosystems,Connectivity,Tropical sea,Collaborative research,Ecosystem function,"
"new insight into internal waves for maritime applications: a novel optical method with ocean experimental results","2021","Internal waves generated by the movement of surface and subsurface vehicles in the ocean have specific importance in maritime applications. These types of waves are categorized as forced internal waves. In this article, an attempt using a novel optical method is made to study the forced internal waves that are generated by a large surface vehicle in a controlled sea exercise. The optical method uses a diode laser operating at 635 nm and a lateral-effect position-sensitive photodetector. The laser beam undergoes modulation in both its intensity and beam positions with respect to the density variations that are caused in the stratified ocean by the forced internal waves. The experimental scheme, the system aspect of the optical method, and supporting theoretical aspects are detailed with corroborating experimental results. It is observed that the frequency of the forced internal waves also remains within the band of naturally occurring ambient oscillations in the ocean. The obtained results indicate that the forced internal waves detected by the optical method can be used for detecting the movement of maritime vehicles in the ocean.","lateral-effect position-sensing photodetector,optical method,maritime vehicles movement,remotely operated vehicles,Surface waves,Measurement by laser beam,Optical sensors,ocean waves,lateral-effect position-sensitive photodetector,photodetectors,laser beam,Internal waves,diode laser,semiconductor lasers,maritime applications,laser beams,laser beam deflection,Laser beams,naturally occurring ambient oscillations,naval anti-submarine warfare (ASW) applications,forced internal waves,Refractive index,ocean optics,wavelength 635.0 nm,oceanographic techniques,ocean experimental results,"
"framestep: a framework for annotating semantic trajectories based on episodes","2018","We are witnessing an increasing usage of location data by a variety of applications. Consequently, information systems are required to deal with large datasets containing raw data to build high level abstractions. Semantic Web technologies offer powerful representation tools for pervasive applications. The convergence of location-based services and Semantic Web standards allows an easier interlinking and annotation of trajectories. However, due to the wide range of requirements on modeling mobile object trajectories, it is important to define a high-level data model for representing trajectory episodes and contextual elements with multiple levels of granularity and different options to represent spatial and temporal extents, as well as to express quantitative and qualitative semantic descriptions. In this article, we focus on modeling mobile object trajectories in the context of Semantic Web. First, we introduce a new version of the Semantic Trajectory Episodes (STEP) ontology to represent generic spatiotemporal episodes. Then, we present FrameSTEP as a new framework for annotating semantic trajectories based on episodes. As a result, we combine our ontology, which can represent spatiotemporal phenomena at different levels of granularity, with annotation algorithms, which allow to create instances of our model. The proposed spatial annotation algorithm explores the Linked Open Data cloud and OpenStreetMap tags to find relevant types of spatial features in order to describe the environment where the trajectory took place. Our framework can guide the development of future expert systems in trajectory analysis. It enables reasoning about knowledge gathered from large trajectory data and linked datasets in order to create several intelligent services.","Semantic web,Trajectory modeling,Trajectory annotation,"
"the impact of circulation and dust deposition in controlling the distributions of dissolved fe and al in the south indian subtropical gyre","2015","The South Indian Subtropical Gyre (SISG) is one of the least studied gyre systems of the world ocean with respect to trace elements. Here we report dissolved (<0.45μm) Fe and Al measurements collected during two high-resolution US-CLIVAR CO2 Repeat Hydrography sections, which transected the upper 1000m of the gyre zonally along ~32°S (I05) and meridionally along ~30°E (I06S). Particulate Fe and Al concentrations in waters influenced by the Agulhas Current are also presented. The distributions of dissolved Fe and Al in the gyre are primarily impacted by mineral dust deposition at the surface and the large-scale circulation patterns of the gyre at depth. Using mean mixed layer dissolved Al concentrations, we estimate that the deposition and partial dissolution of mineral dust emanating from South Africa and Australia vary from 60 to 685mg (dust) m−2yr−1 across the 32°S transect. This translates into a dust source of dissolved Fe ranging from 1.7 to 20μmolFem−2y−1. The zonal patterns of aeolian deposition and those of N*, an indirect geochemical tracer for nitrogen fixation, show remarkable similarities along the I05 transect, suggesting that aeolian delivery of Fe may regulate nitrogen fixation rates in the SISG. In the western SISG (west of 60°E), which receives some of the highest aeolian Fe fluxes of the 32°S section, the Fe:AOU ratio in Indian Central Water was elevated relative to that observed in the Indian Central Water occupying the eastern Indian Ocean. These elevated Fe:AOU ratios may reflect the remineralization of Fe-rich organic material from nitrogen fixing organisms at the western end of the basin. Below the mixed layer, the distribution of dissolved Al appears to trace the principal features of the large-scale circulation of the SISG. Elevated subsurface concentrations of dissolved Al (>4nM) in the southwest Indian Ocean west of 45–50°E are most likely sustained by leakage of Al-rich waters from the Agulhas Return Current. Along the southeast African margin, the elevated particulate Fe (up to 230nM) and Al (up to 690nM) concentrations reflect the resuspension and transport of shelf sediments by the highly energetic Agulhas Current. However, while the particulate inputs at the margin are massive and appear to supply modest amounts of dissolved Fe, the distribution of dissolved Al is decoupled from the particulate phase. This observation suggests that the elevated subsurface dissolved Al concentrations observed near the African shelf are not the result of sediment resuspension processes occurring in situ along I05 but are more likely an advected signal originating from the upper reaches of the Agulhas Current.","CLIVAR,Al aluminium,Fe iron,Indian Ocean,"
"butyltin compounds in a sediment core from the old tilbury basin, london, uk","2005","Sections from a sediment core taken from the River Thames were analysed for butyltin species using gas chromatography with species-specific isotope dilution mass spectrometry. Results demonstrated that in most samples tributyltin concentrations of 20–60ng/g accounted for <10% of the total butyltin species present, which is in agreement with data from other sediment samples which were historically contaminated with tributyltin. Vertical distribution of the organotin residues with depth throughout the core, with data on organochlorine compounds and heavy metals allowed for the construction of a consistent hypothesis on historical deposition of contaminated sediments. From this it was possible to infer that the concentrations of tributyltin in sediments deposited during the early 1960s were in the order of 400–600μg/g by using degradation rate constants derived by other workers. Such values fall well within the range quoted for harbour sediments in the literature.","Antifoulant,Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry,Tributyltin,Gas chromatography,Isotope dilution,"
"historical ais data-driven unsupervised automatic extraction of directional maritime traffic networks","2020","Vessel experience route analysis can provide empirical support for maritime traffic management. Recently, the application of the Automatic Identification System (AIS) provides multi-dimensional data about voyages and vessels. However, traditional route extraction methods do not take into account information such as the vessel traffic pattern and the density distribution in the channel. The experience routes obtained is not accurate enough. This paper proposes an unsupervised method for extracting vessel experience routes from historical AIS data. The method consists of three parts: vessel traffic pattern extraction, channel boundary extraction, channel triangle network construction and hottest route extraction. The method comprehensively considers the spatiotemporal information and density distribution of the vessel trajectories, and constructs a directional maritime traffic network which can effectively convert historical data into information supporting decision-making.","Traffic control,vessel experience route analysis,data mining,Clustering algorithms,Kernel,empirical support,historical data,unsupervised method,Feature extraction,historical AIS data-driven unsupervised automatic extraction,Directional Maritime Traffic Network,maritime traffic management,vessel traffic pattern extraction,information supporting decision-making,channel triangle network construction,multidimensional data,density distribution,automatic identification system,marine safety,marine engineering,Traffic Pattern,channel boundary extraction,pattern clustering,decision making,Artificial intelligence,vessel trajectories,Trajectory,Triangular Network,traffic engineering computing,directional maritime traffic network,Data mining,voyages,vessel experience routes,"

"gpu-accelerated compression and visualization of large-scale vessel trajectories in maritime iot industries","2020","The automatic identification system (AIS), an automatic vessel-tracking system, has been widely adopted to perform intelligent traffic management and collision avoidance services in maritime Internet-of-Things (IoT) industries. With the rapid development of maritime transportation, tremendous numbers of AIS-based vessel trajectory data have been collected, which make trajectory data compression imperative and challenging. This article mainly focuses on the compression and visualization of large-scale vessel trajectories and their graphics processing unit (GPU)-accelerated implementations. The visualization was implemented to investigate the influence of compression on vessel trajectory data quality. In particular, the Douglas-Peucker (DP) and kernel density estimation (KDE) algorithms, respectively, utilized for trajectory compression and visualization, were significantly accelerated through the massively parallel computation capabilities of the GPU architecture. Comprehensive experiments on trajectory compression and visualization have been conducted on large-scale AIS data of recording ship movements collected from three different water areas, i.e., the South Channel of Yangtze River Estuary, the Chengshan Jiao Promontory, and the Zhoushan Islands. Experimental results illustrated that: 1) the proposed GPU-based parallel implementation frameworks could significantly reduce the computational time for both trajectory compression and visualization; 2) the influence of compressed vessel trajectories on trajectory visualization could be negligible if the compression threshold was selected suitably; and 3) the Gaussian kernel was capable of generating more appropriate KDE-based visualization performance by comparing with other seven kernel functions.","trajectory compression,Douglas-Peucker algorithm,vessel trajectory data quality,trajectory visualization,Internet of Things,Industries,GPU-accelerated compression,large-scale vessel trajectories,data visualisation,Acceleration,compression threshold,vessel trajectory,parallel computing,ships,KDE-based visualization,marine safety,kernel density estimation,marine engineering,GPU-based parallel implementation frameworks,maritime transportation,graphics processing units,automatic identification system,collision avoidance services,maritime IoT industries,intelligent traffic management,compressed vessel trajectories,KDE algorithm,Artificial intelligence,AIS-based vessel trajectory data,data compression,Data visualization,graphics processing unit (GPU),graphics processing unit,Graphics processing units,Trajectory,maritime Internet-of-Things industries,large-scale AIS data,marine vehicles,automatic vessel-tracking system,"
"drought-triggered western spruce budworm outbreaks in the interior pacific northwest: a multi-century dendrochronological record","2014","Douglas-fir forests in the interior Pacific Northwest are subject to sporadic outbreaks of the western spruce budworm, a species widely recognized as the most destructive defoliator in western North America. Outbreaks of the western spruce budworm often occur synchronously over broad regions and lead to widespread loss of leaf area and decrease in growth rates in affected stands. In spite of the ecological and economic significance of this defoliator, the mechanisms controlling this species’ population dynamics are still not fully understood. We used dendrochronological methods to reconstruct three centuries of western spruce budworm outbreaks at thirteen sites along a transect running from central Oregon to western Montana and compared the outbreak reconstructions with regional drought history. The reconstructions reveal repeated western spruce budworm outbreaks that sometimes persisted more than a decade and were significantly synchronous among sites. Synchrony was higher in the second half of the record, possibly due to changes in forest composition and structure brought about by land use practices. Across stands and regions, there was a moderately strong relationship between initiation of synchronous outbreaks and periods of transitional climate conditions in which moisture availability was below average prior to outbreak initiation, but above average in the first few years of an outbreak. There was a weak relationship between cessation of outbreaks and one or more years of high moisture availability. Outbreaks tended to occur near the end of droughts. The association between climatic variability and outbreak dynamics observed across this transect indicates that climate is an important driver of western spruce budworm outbreaks. Other factors that we did not test, but that may influence outbreak dynamics include stand structure, forest composition, predation, and phenological synchrony between larvae and host trees. Future changes in western spruce budworm outbreak dynamics will be determined by a combination of changing climate, interactions with other disturbance agents, and changing forest composition and structure. Our results suggest that western spruce budworm outbreaks will likely intensify if drought frequency increases in the future.","Dendrochronology,Pacific Northwest,Drought,Western spruce budworm,Defoliators,Insect outbreaks,"
"the twenty-first century of structural engineering research: a topic modeling approach","2022","Aiming at disclosing a general research landscape of structural engineering in the twenty-first century, this study applies the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), a topic modeling approach, to analyze 51,346 article abstracts from 23 prestigious journals in structural engineering with a publication period from 2000 to 2020. The LDA analyzes the literature inventory by extracting 50 distinguishable wordclouds, each centered around one distinct research theme and assigned a unique topic name. Subsequently, various measures have been proposed to integrate the posterior distributions of these research topics with article information such as publication year, journal name, and correspondence address. The increase index identifies five cold and hot topics, which reflect the shift of research interests in the community. Emerging research topics such as seismic risk assessment and composite material have received much more attention in recent years. Moreover, advanced metrics have been proposed to analyze the research similarity and evolution across different journals and countries/regions. As discussed in the paper, analysis findings would enable community stakeholders (e.g., students, engineers, researchers, conference organizers, journal editors, funding agencies) to explore the state of the research and develop viable strategies to further foster the healthy growth of the community. Such strategies can be (1) researchers submitting a paper to the most appropriate journal; (2) journal editors adjusting the journal focus to enhance its impact; and (3) funding agencies prioritizing research supports that best fit regional needs and circumstances, among others.","Structural engineering research,Country/region topic distribution,Topic modeling,Latent Dirichlet allocation,Cold and hot topics,Journal topic distribution,"

"efficient scheduling for video transmissions in maritime wireless communication networks","2015","This paper develops a framework for vessel surveillance video uploading via maritime wideband communication networks. A broadband wireless network utilizing a time-division-multiple-access (TDMA)-based media access control protocol is employed to establish a shore-side network infrastructure, and a packet store-carry-forward routing mechanism is adopted to achieve intermittent network connectivity in maritime communications. To provide high-quality videos to the administrative authority, a resource allocation problem is formulated to maximize the throughput priority-based video transmission problem, subject to the intermittent network connections and the time indexes such as the release time and deadline of each video packet. To reduce computational complexity, time-capacity mapping is applied to transform the original resource allocation problem into a two-machine nonpreemptive scheduling problem. Three offline scheduling algorithms are proposed, namely, a time-capacity-mapping-based two-phase (TMTP) algorithm for a single machine, a TMTP algorithm for two machines, and an interval graph-theory-based job relay selection (IGTJRS) algorithm. It is mathematically proved that the IGTJRS algorithm has an approximation ratio (i.e., the ratio of the throughput of an optimal schedule to that of the IGTJRS algorithm) of 2 and time complexity of O(n2).

Pollution levels of a wide range of chemicals of ecotoxicological concern were also measured in sediments and in fish species from different trophic levels. Statistical analysis evidenced significant differences among pollutant levels between both sediments and fish collected in shipwreck sites and controls.

"distribution of sulfur aerosol precursors in the spcz released by continuous volcanic degassing at ambrym, vanuatu","2016","The Melanesian Volcanic Arc (MVA) emits about 12kTd−1 of sulfur dioxide (SO2) to the atmosphere from continuous passive (non-explosive) volcanic degassing, which contributes 20% of the global SO2 emission from volcanoes. Here we assess, from up-to-date and long-term observations, the SO2 emission of the Ambrym volcano, one of the dominant volcanoes in the MVA, and we investigate its role as sulfate precursor on the regional distribution of aerosols, using both satellite observations and model results at 1°×1° spatial resolution from WRF-Chem/GOCART. Without considering aerosol forcing on clouds, our model parameterizations for convection, vertical mixing and cloud properties provide a reliable chemical weather representation, making possible a cross-examination of model solution and observations. This preliminary work enables the identification of biases and limitations affecting both the model (missing sources) and satellite sensors and algorithms (for aerosol detection and classification) and leads to the implementation of improved transport and aerosol processes in the modeling system. On the one hand, the model confirms a 50% underestimation of SO2 emissions due to satellite swath sampling of the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI), consistent with field studies. The OMI irregular sampling also produces a level of noise that impairs its monitoring capacity during short-term volcanic events. On the other hand, the model reveals a large sensitivity on aerosol composition and Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) due to choices of both the source function in WRF-Chem and size parameters for sea-salt in FlexAOD, the post-processor used to compute offline the simulated AOD. We then proceed to diagnosing the role of SO2 volcanic emission in the regional aerosol composition. The model shows that both dynamics and cloud properties associated with the South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ) have a large influence on the oxidation of SO2 and on the transport pathways of volcanic species across the South Pacific atmosphere. For example, in the tropical cloudy air, the sulfate production in the aqueous phase is very efficient, resulting in the formation of a large cloud of highly scattering sulfate aerosols advected horizontally to Eastern Indonesia, in agreement with the AOD feature captured by MODIS/Aqua, but missed in CALIOP/CALIPSO (lidar) products. Model sensitivity experiments indicate that aerosol re-suspension due to evaporating droplets is a significant pathway for the supply of volcanic sulfur species in the remote marine boundary layer. By strongly modulating the irreversible loss due to wet scavenging, this aerosol process has a similar influence on the sulfur burden as natural emission from volcanoes or biogenic sources like dimethyl sulfate (DMS). The results emphasize the importance of MVA passive degassing and SPCZ dynamics on the aerosol background, and raise questions about potential impacts on the local climate and marine ecosystems.","Volcanic plume impacts,Aerosol modeling,SO dispersal,SPCZ dynamics,Remote sensing,Regional aerosol climatology,"

As ship routes are relatively stable, the global information in terms of release time, deadline and other time indices of video packets, as well as the schedules of vessels is known a priori. We propose two offline scheduling algorithms, namely Time-capacity mapping based two phase (TMTP) algorithm, and Interval graph theory based job relay selection (IGTJRS) algorithm. Both algorithms achieve a time complexity of O(n2). The performance of proposed algorithms is evaluated through simulation based on actual ship route traces obtained from dedicated Navigation software BLM-Ship.","worldwide interoperability for microwave access,telecommunication network routing,Schedules,offline scheduling algorithms,scheduling,Software algorithms,video packets store carry and forward scheduling,telecommunication network topology,Relays,intermittent network connectivity,maritime wideband communication,WiMAX technology,shore side network infrastructure,Wideband,time capacity mapping,resource allocation problem,graph theory,broadband networks,interval graph theory based job relay selection algorithm,marine communication,Scheduling,WiMAX,monitoring videos,resource allocation,WiMax,"
"accurate ship tracking in maritime images with kernelized correlation filter and curve fitting","2019","At present, the single tracking algorithm is generally used to achieve the single-target ship tracking task. Although the tracking result is ideal at this time, when the target ship is blocked by other obstacles, the tracking result will be greatly reduced. In order to solve this problem, this paper proposes a ship tracking framework based on nuclear correlation filter (KCF) and curve fitting. In the first step, the KCF algorithm is used to obtain accurate position data of the target target ship before and after occlusion and position data of the occluded stage. In the second step, according to the obtained position data, a trajectory conforming to the navigation of the target ship is obtained by a curve fitting method. In the third step, the proposed ship tracking framework is verified in several offshore video databases.","Linear fitting,ship tracking framework,target ship navigation,curve fitting method,marine navigation,offshore video databases,nuclear correlation filter,kernelized correlation filter,target tracking,object tracking,ships,marine engineering,Visual ship tracking,Kernelized Correlation Filters,maritime images,video signal processing,image filtering,correlation methods,Ship tracking challenge,curve fitting,KCF algorithm,single-target ship tracking,"

"visual drone detection and tracking for autonomous operation from maritime vessel","2022","To allow incorporation of autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV's/drones) into maritime military operations, it is critical to be able to accurately localize the UAV with respect to the moving maritime vessel during the take-off and landing phases. This work addresses the study and implementation of a visual detection, tracking and three-dimensional positioning method for a specific drone from a moving maritime vessel. The YOLOv5 detector and the OceanPlus tracker have been trained on a custom dataset with good performance in accuracy and processing time. The drone's position with respect to the vessel is estimated by applying stereo triangulation to the centres of the bounding boxes returned by the object detectors and trackers. The performance of the proposed positioning method was evaluated in a realistic simulated environment in the Unreal Game Engine. The proposed method allows detection, tracking, and positioning of a target drone at ranges exceeding 100m while achieving positioning errors below 10cm during landing phases.","stereo triangulation,maritime vessel,object detectors,three-dimensional positioning method,take-off and landing phases,mesh generation,robot vision,Games,autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles,Sea measurements,military computing,OceanPlus tracker,object tracking,visuasl tracking,military robotics,Target tracking,object detection,position control,stereo image processing,maritime military operations,visual drone detection,unreal game engine,Robots,Autonomous aerial vehicles,YOLOv5 detector,convolutional neural nets,autonomous aerial vehicles,marine engineering computing,Tracking,Object Detection,mobile robots,Visualization,computer games,visual drone tracking,marine control,autonomous operation,Detectors,UAV,synthetic data,"
"shell disease in eastern oysters, crassostrea virginica, reared in france","2002","Progeny of eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica, introduced into France in 1992, were reared in IFREMER facilities to test their growth performances. During the summer of 1993, sporadic mass mortalities (80–90%) occurred among C. virginica spat reared in the IFREMER laboratories in La Tremblade (Charente Maritime, France) and Bouin (Vendée, France). Affected oysters presented mantle retraction and deposition of an anomalous conchiolin layer on the inner surface of the shell. The incidence of oysters with gross signs exceeded 80%. No obvious pathogen was identified in soft tissues by histology and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). However, histological examination showed the presence of anomalous basophilic round structures, 0.5–1 μm in diameter, in gill and mantle connective tissues. These extracellular Feulgen-negative structures reacted positively with the von Kossa stain. TEM examination on mantle and gill samples in diseased spat showed that the basophilic bodies consisted of concentric deposits of an amorphous substance interpreted as containing calcium. These observations may indicate that the mineralization process in spat shells was disturbed without exact determination of the cause. Based on the similarities of the gross signs to those reported in juvenile eastern oysters in the United States, we believe that the cause of the mortalities observed in France was probably the Juvenile Oyster Disease. Moreover, we report for the first time the detection of anomalous amorphous structures in gill and mantle connective tissues associated with mortalities and deposition of an anomalous conchioloin layer on the inner shell surface in C. virginica spat.",""
"a new approach to forecast solar irradiances using wrf and libradtran models, validated with merra-2 reanalysis data and pyranometer measures","2021","Solar energy is playing an increasingly important role in the production of electricity through photovoltaic and Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) systems. This type of energy requires an efficient storage system that will allow its use when the sunset or during cloudy weather. Hence, 0-48 hours forecast lead time is crucial for electrical network managers to anticipate energy deficits during periods of cloud occurrence. This study presents a new approach to forecast solar irradiances using a Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) model outputs, coupled with a Radiative Transfer operator, namely libRadtran. The NWP model used in this study is the WRF-Solar configuration of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF), designed for solar energy in order to forecast solar irradiances. The other parameters forecasted by WRF like the vertical profiles of cloud liquid water (CLW), cloud ice water (IWC), clouds fraction, relative humidity, and temperature will be used as input for libRadtran to compute off-line the solar irradiances. Both forecasted irradiances were first compared with the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications Version-2 (MERRA-2) data, then validated a second time by ground measurements for three locations in Algeria for the years 2016 and 2017. The results clearly show that the solar irradiances forecasted directly by WRF-Solar underestimate the MERRA-2 data for high solar zenith angles. With regard to the proposed approach, there is an improvement in the forecast of the solar irradiances during clear sky days and the rRMSE of the calculated Global Tilted Irradiance (GTI) reaches 12% in winter and increases to 22% in summer.","libRadtran,Forecasting,MERRA-2,Global irradiance,WRF,"
"gnss-based passive radar for maritime surveillance: long integration time mti technique","2017","The exploitation of the Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) as transmitters of opportunity in passive radar systems for maritime surveillance is particularly attractive because of the main advantages consisting in a global coverage (even in open sea) and in the availability of multiple sources (different satellites and constellations). The main drawback stays in the restricted power budget provided by navigation satellites. This makes necessary to conceive, define and develop innovative moving target detection techniques specifically tailored for the system under consideration, in order to make this technology a powerful tool for persistent surveillance of sea areas of interest. To this aim, a long integration time Maritime Moving Target Indication technique is proposed in this work, and its effectiveness is proved against experimental data involving a small maritime target, not detectable by conventional MTI techniques. Obtained results prove the feasibility of a maritime MTI mode for GNSS based passive systems.","navigation satellites,radar detection,long integration time maritime moving target indication technique,passive radar,moving target detection techniques,marine navigation,long integration time MTI technique,satellite navigation,maritime surveillance,GNSS-based radar,object detection,search radar,Doppler effect,Radar cross-sections,Maritime Moving Target Indication (M-MTI),restricted power budget,Passive radar,GNSS-based passive radar,Receivers,Surveillance,Spaceborne radar,Global Navigation Satellite System,sea surveillance,"
"sar and ais fusion for maritime surveillance","2018","This paper presents a novel approach to fuse Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images and Automatic Identification System (AIS) data for maritime surveillance. The procedure consists of four steps. First, ship detection is performed in the SAR image using a Constant False Alarm Rate (CFAR) algorithm; then feature extraction (ship position, heading and size) is performed on ships detected in the SAR image, the third step consists in identifying the detected ships and extracting the same features from the AIS data. The final step is to feed the fusion block with both features vectors extracted separately from the SAR and AIS. Here the arithmetic mean function is established. The algorithm is tested using simulated SAR images and AIS data. Preliminary results of the fusion of SAR and AIS data are presented and discussed.","Constant False Alarm Rate algorithm,AIS fusion,ship detection,radar detection,Marine vehicles,simulated SAR images,ship monitoring,Feature extraction,data fusion,Automatic Identification System data,fusion block,SAR,Synthetic aperture radar,image fusion,ships,SAR image,AIS,maritime surveillance,synthetic aperture radar,feature extraction,Synthetic Aperture Radar images,search radar,radar imaging,Artificial intelligence,ship position,features vectors,Surveillance,AIS data,Detectors,"
"real time observations of oceanographic and meteorological parameters for maritime transportation: origins and novel applications","2018","The first NOAA Physical Oceanographic Real-Time System (PORTSÂ®) was established in Tampa Bay, Florida, becoming operational in 1991 (https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/ports/index.shtml?port=tb). In April 2018, the Miami Physical Oceanographic Real-Time System was dedicated as the 30th such system in the US, followed closely by Port Everglades PORTSÂ® in June 2018 as the 31st. PORTSÂ® collects and disseminates real time meteorological and oceanographic data within major harbors around the US. PORTSÂ® data are an essential component for maintaining the safety and efficiency of maritime operations. Before the advent of PORTSÂ®, knowledge of environmental conditions relevant to ship operations in US harbors was generally limited to wind and precipitation sensors at the local airports and similar shipboard instrumentation. Water levels were inferred from standard tide tables even though surface winds were known to produce significant deviations from predicted values. This incomplete knowledge often led to navigational errors and to accidents. This paper will review the history of PORTSÂ® development, highlighting recent advances in sensor technologies and novel uses of PORTSÂ® data. On May 9, 1980, the 580 foot, 20,000 ton bulk carrier Summit Venture was approaching a critical turn toward the Sunshine Skyway Bridge in Tampa Bay, Florida and was overtaken by a violent, blinding thunderstorm. The ship veered off course and crashed into a main support pier of the bridge, collapsing the southbound span. Thirty-six people in vehicles fell into the water; 35 did not survive. The main ship channel into Tampa Bay port facilities was closed for 6 weeks, causing severe disruption to supplies of fuel and other commodities to the entire central Florida region. In the wake of the disaster, the local maritime community, led by the Tampa Bay Pilots Association and the Tampa Port Authority, petitioned the US Congress for funding to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to improve environmental monitoring capabilities in the bay. Nearly a decade later, the Tampa Bay Oceanography Project (TOP) began in 1990 as part of NOAA's Coastal Ocean Circulation Program (COCP). This included a 15 month study of currents, water levels, water temperatures, salinity, winds, and other meteorological/oceanographic parameters. By the end of the project, TOP had collected the largest number of circulation measurements in one estuary in the 100-year history of COCP. Successful completion of TOP was followed by permanent deployment of real-time telemetered sensors measuring winds, currents, and water levels at critical locations in the bay - the first official NOAA PORTSÂ® installation. Since 1991, local operations and maintenance of the system have been directed by the Greater Tampa Bay Marine Advisory Council-PORTS, Inc., a non-profit consortium of maritime interests, through cooperative agreements with the NOAA National Ocean Service Center for Operational Products and Services and the University of South Florida Center for Maritime and Port Studies. The success of TB-PORTS made it a prototype for a national program. Within three years of TB-PORTS becoming operational, San Francisco Bay and Houston/Galveston Bay implemented their own PORTSÂ® networks. Today PORTSÂ® operates 24 hours a day/7 days a week in 31 locations around the coasts and Great Lakes of the United States and is a component of the Integrated Ocean Observing System national backbone. The local operation and maintenance of PORTSÂ® facilities in each port remains funded by local maritime interests under the direction of NOAA/NOS/CO-OPS, who sets operational standards and manages the data quality control and dissemination through the Continuous Operational Real-Time Monitoring System (CORMS). PORTSÂ® data are provided to the public through the NOAA websitehttp://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/ports.html. A prototype project in Tampa Bay provides PORTSÂ® data to pilots aboard ships over the Automatic Identification System (AIS), now required on all commercial vessels over 20 m in length, in collaboration with the US Coast Guard R&D Center. The long time series observations of winds, currents, water levels, and other parameters in Tampa Bay from PORTSÂ® has fueled numerous scientific studies on the dynamics of the estuary. New sensor technologies have been incorporated into the PORTSÂ® data stream in recent years, including wave height, period, and direction, atmospheric visibility, and most recently, current measurements from sensors mounted on standard US Coast Guard aids to navigation buoys.","water levels,tides,Marine vehicles,transportation,https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/ports/index.shtml,Bridges,Sea measurements,environmental monitoring (geophysics),Maritime transportation,oceanographic equipment,ships,marine safety,real-time systems,Oceans,US Government agencies,NOAA websitehttp://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/ports.html,quality control,sea ports,Real-time systems,oceanographic regions,Tampa Bay port facilities,wind,precision navigation,bridges (structures),ocean observing,Greater Tampa Bay Marine Advisory Council-PORTS,Sensors,Port Everglades PORTS,TB-PORTS,oceanographic techniques,"
"surface ozone in the north american pollution outflow region of nova scotia: long-term analysis of surface concentrations, precursor emissions and long-range transport influence","2021","Nova Scotia is in the air pollution outflow region of North America and experiences elevated surface air pollution episodes regularly. We present the first analysis of long-term (2000–2018) hourly ozone (O3) and ozone precursor gas trends at three Nova Scotia provincial monitoring locations (‘urban’ Halifax, ‘suburban’ Halifax at Lake Major and ‘regional background’ at Aylesford Mountain), together with an examination of provincial ozone precursor emission trends. The precursors considered are nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOC). Over the common data period for the three stations (2006–2017) the annual 99th percentile hourly ozone concentrations decreased significantly in Halifax (−0.77 ppb/year; p = 0.02) and at Aylesford (−0.65 ppb/year; p = 0.03), in agreement with regional trends. No statistically significant changes were found in high ozone at suburban Lake Major (−0.02 ppb/year; p = 0.94), but the annual 25th percentile, median, and 75th percentile hourly ozone concentrations increased significantly (p < 0.01) only at this location (1.09 ppb/year, 1.23 ppb/year, 1.03 ppb/year, respectively). This is consistent with the strong NOx-O3 titration effect in downtown Halifax decreasing over time. After correcting for the titration effect over the full study period, the annual median Halifax total ozone is found to be decreasing (−0.45 ppb/year; p = 0.02). Over the full study period, ambient concentrations of precursors decreased significantly (p < 0.01) in Halifax by −2.34 ppb/year for NOx and −3.41 μg/m3/year for VOCs, as did the ozone formation potential (OFP) of VOCs (−9.66 μg/m3/year; p < 0.01). The underlying emissions of precursors also decreased significantly (p < 0.01) in and near Halifax (provincial NOx: 3982 ppb/year; provincial VOCs: 1680 tonnes/year), also in agreement with regional trends. However, a linear regression during 2012–2018 showed a decelerating reduction of provincial NOx emissions. Provincial total VOC emissions also decreased approximately ten times slower during 2012–2018, albeit this was not statistically significant. Finally, we present an algorithm to identify events of long-range transported pollution in Halifax, based on spatial correlations in ozone across surface monitoring stations in Nova Scotia. Between 2000 and 2018, transported upstream pollution was found to be connected to between 45% and 63% of 1444 days when surface ozone was elevated in Halifax. The frequency with which transported pollution events occur increased by 15% across this time period.","Precursor emissions,Ozone,Transport,Trends,Transboundary,Nova scotia,"

"maritime search and rescue networking based on multi-agent cooperative communication","2019","Rapid and effective maritime search and rescue operations become the important guarantee for the safety of maritime navigation. The existing maritime search and rescue networking and model have slow response speed and low efficiency. The distribution, synergy, parallelism, robustness and intelligence of unmanned surface vehicle (USV) and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) provide a new idea for the novel maritime search and rescue networking, in which multi-agent could be used to build a layered control network. In this paper, a novel rapid search and rescue system is proposed by utilizing the improved ant colony optimization and the independent calculation decision of the agents. The system adopts the edge computing, relies on the information sharing and the cooperative decision between the search and rescue agent groups. It achieves the independent synchronous search and rescue. At the same time, we use particle swarm optimization to intelligently schedule data packets during the rescue process to optimize network forwarding performance. Based on the distributed cluster control of USV and UAV, this paper combines edge computing, cooperative communication and centralized task allocation together to make decision for rescue. The simulation results show that our proposed schemes realize a significant improvement for maritime search and rescue.","search and rescue,Edge computing,Unmanned aerial vehicles,cooperative communication,Satellites,edge computing,Task analysis,Base stations,swarm intelligence,Marine vehicles,Accidents,"
"a two-parameter approximation in cloudiness variability studies","1992","In order to separate the influence of clouds on the Earth's radiation budget from that of several other meteorological parameters, a simple two-parameter approximation of monthly mean cloudiness is produced on the basis of the Nimbus-7 wide field-of-view radiometer eigth-year measurements (1978–1986). The approximation converts the radiation budget components at the top of the Earth's atmosphere into two effective cloud parameters: cloud amount and cloud-top height over the latitude belt 58.5°S–58.5°N. Instead of real three-level cloudiness the approximation treats global cloudiness as one opaque layer with determined albedo for solar radiation. Cloud emissivity is supposed to be 1. The main goal for the approximation is to use these effective parameters for describing the interannual redistribution of cloudiness. Energetical scales of the obtained redistributions inspire an alternative to the widely produced, CO2 induced global warming.

"a review on northern hemisphere sea-ice, storminess and the north atlantic oscillation: observations and projected changes","2011","The Arctic has undergone substantial changes over the last few decades in various cryospheric and derivative systems and processes. Of these, the Arctic sea ice regime has seen some of the most rapid change and is one of the most visible markers of Arctic change outside the scientific community. This has drawn considerable attention not only from the natural sciences, but increasingly, from the political and commercial sectors as they begin to grapple with the problems and opportunities that are being presented. The possible impacts of past and projected changes in Arctic sea ice, especially as it relates to climatic response, are of particular interest and have been the subject of increasing research activity. A review of the current knowledge of the role of sea ice in the climate system is therefore timely. We present a review that examines both the current state of understanding, as regards the impacts of sea-ice loss observed to date, and climate model projections, to highlight hypothesised future changes and impacts on storm tracks and the North Atlantic Oscillation. Within the broad climate-system perspective, the topics of storminess and large-scale variability will be specifically considered. We then consider larger-scale impacts on the climatic system by reviewing studies that have focused on the interaction between sea-ice extent and the North Atlantic Oscillation. Finally, an overview of the representation of these topics in the literature in the context of IPCC climate projections is presented. While most agree on the direction of Arctic sea-ice change, the rates amongst the various projections vary greatly. Similarly, the response of storm tracks and climate variability are uncertain, exacerbated possibly by the influence of other factors. A variety of scientific papers on the relationship between sea-ice changes and atmospheric variability have brought to light important aspects of this complex topic. Examples are an overall reduction in the number of Arctic winter storms, a northward shift of mid-latitude winter storms in the Pacific and a delayed negative NAO-like response in autumn/winter to a reduced Arctic sea-ice cover (at least in some months). This review paper discusses this research and the disagreements, bringing about a fresh perspective on this issue.","Review,Arctic amplification,Teleconnection,Sea ice,Storms,North Atlantic Oscillation,Climate change,Arctic,"

"augmented reality for maritime navigation assistance - egocentric depth perception in large distance outdoor environments","2021","Augmented reality (AR) provides enormous potential to improve navigation assistance interfaces by displaying information directly into the user's field of view. In maritime contexts, such AR interfaces could supplement conventional solutions that require users to interpret spatial positions visualized on two-dimensional maps. In order to design useful navigation assistance, it is crucial to understand how egocentric distances of displayed objects are perceived and how different design attributes influence depth estimation. While previous research mainly focused on depth perception in indoor environments and rather short distances, this paper presents an investigation of the perceived egocentric distance of virtual objects in distances up to 75 meters in an open outdoor environment. In a perceptual matching task experiment using the Microsoft HoloLens 2, participants had to move objects with different (i) shape, (ii) coloration, and (iii) relation to floor to various target distances. Our results suggest that participants overestimated the distance to virtual objects across all tested distances since they significantly underproduced target distances for all investigated design factors. Based on these results, we explored potential design implications for a maritime AR navigation assistance on a ship in the local port area.","augmented reality,Microsoft HoloLens 2,navigation assistance interfaces,spatial positions,human computer interaction,open outdoor environment,ship,marine navigation,egocentric depth perception,indoor environments,design attributes,perceptual matching task experiment,ships,Performance evaluation,marine engineering,distance outdoor environments,Seaports,Shape,perceived egocentric distance,depth estimation,AR interfaces,Indoor environment,two-dimensional maps,maritime navigation assistance,local port area,displayed objects,target distances,Human-centered computing-Human computer interaction (HCI)-Interaction paradigms-Mixed/augmented reality,maritime AR navigation assistance,Visualization,Human-centered computing-Visualization-Empirical studies in visualization-,Navigation,Rendering (computer graphics),virtual objects,user field of view,"
"“ship-port-country” multi-dimensional research on the fine analysis of china's lng trade","2023","Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) is a clean and low-carbon energy source that plays an important role in combating global warming. As the world's largest greenhouse gas (GHG) emitter, China has taken coal-to-gas as an important measure to reduce GHG emissions, and has become the world's largest LNG importer. Studying the patterns and characteristics of China's LNG trade is of great significance for ensuring energy supply security, formulating and adjusting energy strategies. However, the refined analysis of China's LNG trade is still inadequate, mainly due to the lack of research on the details of ship trajectories and port attributes. Therefore, a “ship-port-country” multidimensional LNG trade analysis method is proposed to improve the timeliness, multi-dimensionality and fineness of China's LNG trade analysis. The multidimensional characteristics of China's LNG trade are analyzed by studying the big data of nearly 3.5 billion automatic identification system (AIS) records in 2017. The study has found that (1) The arrival frequency of China's LNG trading ships varies greatly with time. For example, the most frequent daily arrivals are between 04:00 and 05:00 in the morning, while the least frequent arrivals are between 15:00 and 17:00 in the afternoon. (2) The Chinese LNG trade network consisting of 79 ports has been formed, of which NANTONG Port is the most important port. (3) The LNG trade volume calculated in this study has shown a strong correlation with the national LNG trade statistics and can be used to analyze LNG trade with higher spatial and temporal resolution. According to the characteristics of LNG trade at the three levels of ship, port and country, China can optimize its LNG trade policy from the following aspects: (1) Dynamically allocate port resources according to the arrival frequency of LNG tankers to reduce port congestion and waste of resources. (2) Expand core LNG trading ports such as NANTONG Port, ZHOUSHAN Port, TANGSHAN (JINGTANG) Port, XIUYU Port, DALIAN Port and LUSHUN Port. (3) Actively realize the diversification of LNG trading partners to reduce the dependence of LNG import sources on one country or region, and ensure energy security. The “ship-port-country” multi-level LNG trade analysis method proposed in this study provides a new research perspective for the analysis of the LNG trade pattern. This study reveals the multidimensional characteristics of China's LNG trade, which can provide decision-making support for China to formulate reasonable LNG trade policies and energy security policies, and is conducive to the stable and sustainable development of global LNG trade.","Multidimensional analysis,Ship trajectory data,China's LNG trade,LNG trade,Fine-grained trade characteristics,"

"contextual multi-armed bandits for data caching in intermittently-connected lossy maritime networks","2023","Information centric networking (ICN) is a promising architecture for intermittently-connected lossy maritime networks. By decoupling content from location and storing popular content in caches ICNs enable content access even when content producers are disconnected from the network. However, network-resource constraints, node mobility, and low data rates remain as major challenges to achieve the potential benefits that increased data bring to maritime networks. In this work, we propose an ICN architecture that uses dedicated caches and off-path caching to deliver popular network content to consumers. Our architecture motivates a data-caching problem in which each cache must define effective and efficient caching policies, with effectiveness assessed based on the cache-hit ratio achieved by the cache and efficiency assessed based on the usage of the communications budget allocated for data caching purposes. This work develops an online caching algorithm that enables dedicated caches to sequentially decide what content to cache.

"collaborative multiple access and energy-efficient resource allocation in distributed maritime wireless networks","2022","With the rapid increasing of maritime activities, maritime wireless networks (MWNs) with high reliability, high energy efficiency, and low delay are required. However, the centralized networking with fixed resource scheduling is not suitable for MWNs due to the special environment. In this paper, we introduce the collaborative relay communication in distributed MWNs to improve the link reliability, and propose an orthogonal time-frequency resource block reservation based multiple access (RRMA) scheme for both one-hop direct link and two-hop collaborative relay link to reduce the interference. To further improve the network performance, we formulate an energy efficiency (EE) maximization resource allocation problem and solve it by an iterative algorithm based on the Dinkelbach method. Finally, numerical results are provided to investigate the proposed RRMA scheme and resource allocation algorithm, showing that the low outage probability and transmission delay can be attained by the proposed RRMA scheme.

"shipping lane-aware caching and transmission scheme for maritime wireless networks","2020","The shipping lane is one of the most important information of vessels, which is useful in maritime communications. This paper presents a cache-enabled maritime communication network architecture where the shipborne base stations with the cache storages serve as the relay points between the user ships and the shore based networks. Under this architecture, we promote the total network throughput by exploiting the specific characteristics of the maritime shipping lane information. In particular, we use the shipping lanes to calculate the large-scale channel state information (CSI) and predict the future user associations. We propose a shipping lane aware cross-layer resource allocation algorithm to optimize the system throughput in terms of the caching strategy, power allocation and bandwidth allocation, which is a mix-integer non-convex programming problem. We divide the original problem into a capacity optimization problem and a caching placement problem. The capacity optimization problem is relaxed into a large-scale-CSI-only convex problem and solved by Lagrangian dual method. The caching placement problem is solved by a greedy algorithm. The numerical simulation results show the effectiveness of the shipping lane information in optimizing the system throughput compared with the existing algorithms.","Antennas,caching placement problem,large-scale-CSI-only convex problem,shore based networks,Throughput,caching strategy,shipping lane-aware caching scheme,convex programming,Marine vehicles,numerical simulation,shipborne base stations,bandwidth allocation,integer programming,Resource management,Wireless communication,concave programming,ships,large-scale channel state information,relay points,Relays,power allocation,Lagrangian dual method,greedy algorithm,mix-integer nonconvex programming problem,cache-enabled maritime communication network architecture,future user associations,maritime shipping lane information,relay networks (telecommunication),cache storages,Optimization,cache storage,marine communication,capacity optimization problem,maritime wireless networks,greedy algorithms,resource allocation,total network throughput,shipping lane-aware transmission scheme,shipping lane aware cross-layer resource allocation algorithm,"
"influence of atmospheric circulation and local parameters on activity concentration of gross alpha and gross beta in granada, spain","2023","This work analyses the influence of local meteorology and air mass origin on radioactivity levels measured in Granada (Southern Spain). To the scope, gross α and gross β activities at ground-level air were weekly recorded from 2006 to 2021, by collecting aerosol filters and successively analysing them by low-level proportional counting. Time series decomposition shows a strong correlation between the seasonal components of gross α and gross β and the local meteorological parameters, in particular temperature and wind speed. Back trajectories reaching the study area during the sampling, calculated at three height levels (750 m, 1500 m, and 3000 m a.s.l.), were analysed by three methods with the aim to determine the main characteristics of air masses reaching Granada, and their impact on airborne radioactivity levels. The results of the residence time and clustering analyses showed that an increase in the radioactivity levels in the southeast of Spain is connected with air masses coming from the Mediterranean at 750 m and from the South (Sahara Desert) at 3000 m. In line with the outcomes obtained by the cluster analysis, the Concentration Weighted Trajectory (WCWT) results highlight that the air masses transported from Mediterranean and African regions are a potential source of gross α and gross β. Moreover, the findings of the WCWT bring a new aspect by revealing that the southern France region can also have a significant contribution to gross alpha and beta activities.","Gross alpha,Radioactivity,Back-trajectories,Gross beta,Air masses,"
"mvffnet: multi-view feature fusion network for imbalanced ship classification","2021","The accurate classification of moving ships is of fundamental importance to maritime authorities for ensuring the safety and security of shipping operations. With the wide use of automatic identification systems (AISs), which allow ships to receive identification/location information from nearby ships, it is feasible to classify the types of ships by analysing ship behaviour from AIS-based trajectories. However, the imbalanced features of AIS data make it difficult to achieve satisfactory classification results in the presence of several different types of ships. To overcome these potential limitations, we propose a multi-view feature fusion network (MVFFNet) to achieve accurate ship classification with imbalanced data. To guarantee the powerful representation and generalization abilities of MVFFNet, we first extract several multi-view features (i.e., motion features and morphological features) from AIS-based ship trajectories. Several kinematic variables related to ship behaviour are empirically adopted as motion features. The morphological features are automatically extracted via convolutional auto-encoder (CAE) networks. CAE networks are capable of optimally learning the features from informative trajectory images, which are strictly related to the original ship trajectories. The bidirectional gated recurrent unit (BiGRU) network is then proposed to combine multi-view features to generate the ship classification results. In addition, a hybrid loss function is presented to handle the imbalance problem of ship types, potentially leading to enhanced robustness and accuracy of ship classification. Comprehensive experiments on two realistic datasets have demonstrated that our proposed MVFFNet consistently outperforms other competing methods in terms of classification accuracy and robustness.","Ship classification,BiGRU,Imbalanced data,Multi-view feature fusion,CAE,"
"robust infrared maritime target detection via anti-jitter spatialâ€“temporal trajectory consistency","2022","When detecting diverse infrared (IR) small maritime targets on complicated scenes, the existing methods get into trouble and unsatisfactory performance. The main reasons are as follows: 1) affected by target characteristics and ambient temperature and so on, both bright and dark targets may exist on IR maritime images in practical application and 2) spatial information and temporal correlation of targets are not fully excavated. To these problems, we propose a robust anti-jitter spatialâ€“temporal trajectory consistency (ASTTC) method, the main idea of which is to improve detection accuracy using single-frame detection followed by multi-frame decision. First, we innovatively design adaptive local gradient variation (ALGV) descriptor, which combines local dissimilarity measure with gradient magnitude distribution to enhance the local contrast for both bright and dark targets so that the suspected targets can be robustly extracted. For multi-frame decision, interframe displacement correction is necessary to eliminate the interference of IR imager motion and vibration for target codeword. We use pyramid optical flow to track feature point extracted by Shi-Tomasi to capture interframe registration coefficients. Then, the target position is corrected in the spatialâ€“temporal domain. Finally, a robust spatialâ€“temporal trajectory descriptor (STTD), which achieves target encoding and target trajectory consistency measurement, is designed to further confirm real targets and eliminate false targets. Experiments conducted on various real IR maritime image sequences demonstrate the applicability and robustness of ASTTC, which performs more satisfactorily than the existing methods in detection accuracy.","target characteristics,Pipelines,Optical imaging,ALGV descriptor,temporal correlation,robust spatial-temporal trajectory descriptor,image motion analysis,Feature extraction,gradient magnitude distribution,small-target detection,STTD,anti-jitter spatialâ€“temporal trajectory consistency (ASTTC),Adaptive local gradient variation (ALGV),Shi-Tomasi,robust infrared maritime target detection,multiframe decision,single-frame detection,robust anti-jitter spatial-temporal trajectory consistency,Target tracking,object detection,feature extraction,target encoding,IR imager motion,local dissimilarity measure,IR maritime image sequences,interframe registration capture,image registration,correlation methods,gradient methods,ASTTC,infrared imaging,Trajectory,image sequences,target trajectory consistency measurement,spatial information,Object detection,Adaptive optics,image capture,adaptive local gradient variation descriptor,"
"international maritime boundary alert for fishermen","2018","International maritime boundary violation have been an area of grave concern. With more and more fishermen caught up between governments, a solution for this crisis is the need of the day. Our work provides a solution for the problem by designing a handheld module which can provide maritime boundary confirmation through the use of GPS technology. Although there are a huge number of market solutions, our work provides a cost effective solution. In addition this work also considers a case wherein fishermen cross boundaries even after they are aware of their location, due to better resources available across the boundary. In such cases our design provides an intimation to land control station and the coast guard. This system thereby provides better accountability for both fishermen and authorities.

"autonomous uav surveillance of a ship's path with mpc for maritime situational awareness","2017","Maritime Situational Awareness is crucial in maritime operations to identify threats and to deal with them as soon as possible. These threats can be pirates in shipping operations, icebergs when sailing in the northern sea routes, or even unknown vessels or objects that might be on the ship's path. A solution to identify these threats is the use of UAV's to overfly the ship's planned path. This solution is described in this paper, using an autonomous fixed wing UAV. Based on the provided ship's planned path, the UAV should autonomously map the area close to the ship track. To do that, an optimization problem is solved using Model Predictive Control, where the turn rate for the next time period is optimized. Based on the turn rate, the future path of the UAV is calculated and the waypoints are sent to the autopilot. This application is thoroughly tested using a Software In Loop environment, where an aircraft model is used with the autopilot's simulation. The results show that surveillance performance is improved if the UAV has information about the ship's velocity in addition to position.","aircraft,model predictive control,surveillance,ship path planning,autopilot simulation,aircraft model,Model Predictive Control,Marine vehicles,maritime situational awareness,software in loop environment,optimization problem,predictive control,autonomous fixed wing UAV,ships,Path Planning,optimisation,MATLAB,MPC,path planning,autonomous aerial vehicles,Optimization,mobile robots,Predictive control,Sensors,Surveillance,UAV,autonomous UAV surveillance,"
"data-driven detection and context-based classification of maritime anomalies","2015","Discovering anomalies at sea is one of the critical tasks of Maritime Situational Awareness (MSA) activities and an important enabler for maritime security operations. This paper proposes a data-driven approach to anomaly detection, highlighting challenges specific to the maritime domain. This work builds on unsupervised learning techniques which provide models for normal traffic behaviour. A methodology to associate tracks to the derived traffic model is then presented. This is done by the pre-extraction of contextual information as the baseline patterns of life (i.e., routes) in the area under investigation. In addition to a brief description of the approach to derive the routes, their characterization and representation is presented in support of exploitable knowledge to classify anomalies. A hierarchical reasoning is proposed where new tracks are first associated to existing routes based on their positional information only and â€œoff-routeâ€ vesselsâ€ are detected. Then, for on-route vessels further anomalies are detected such as â€œspeed anomalyâ€ or â€œheading anomalyâ€.

"wintertime regional aerosol distribution and the influence of continental transport over the indian ocean","2003","During the Asian winter monsoon period, the Indian Ocean region is affected by large scale transport of aerosols from the dry Asian continent, which can influence the radiation budget of the region. The regional distribution of aerosols over the Indian Ocean and the influence of long-range transport during the Asian dry period of November–April of 1996–1999 are studied, based on satellite derived aerosol optical depth (AOD) and the wind data obtained from the NCEP-NCAR reanalysis. AOD over the Indian Ocean region is observed to be significantly influenced by the transport of aerosols from Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia and Arabia. AOD as well as its latitude gradient in the Northern Hemisphere generally increase from November to April. High aerosol loading observed over the Indian Ocean during February–April period of 1999 is closely associated with the changes in atmospheric circulation features and transport from the Asian continent.","Aerosol transport,Indian Ocean experiment,ElNino,Optical depth,Satellite remote sensing,"

"associative learning of vessel motion patterns for maritime situation awareness","2006","Neurobiologically inspired algorithms have been developed to continuously learn behavioral patterns at a variety of conceptual, spatial, and temporal levels.

Our algorithms take real-time tracking information and learn motion pattern models on-the-fly, enabling the models to adapt well to evolving situations while maintaining high levels of performance. The constantly refined models, resulting from concurrent incremental learning, are used to evaluate the behavior patterns of vessels based on their present motion states. At the event level, learning provides the capability to detect (and alert) upon anomalous behavior. At a higher (inter-event) level, learning enables predictions, over pre-defined time horizons, to be made about future vessel location. Predictions can also be used to alert on anomalous behavior.

"optimal search facilities selection model for joint aeronautical and maritime search","2021","Joint aeronautical and maritime search and rescue is the most effective way of performing rescues at sea. The value and effectiveness of a search and rescue (SAR) are far greater when using a coordinated air-maritime search than when using only vessels or aircraft. However, the harmonization of aeronautical and maritime SAR is complex and potentially life-threatening. When the location of the target in distress is unknown, the search process must be carried out. As the sole way to locate and rescue survivors, the search process is the most costly, hazardous, and complicated part of the whole SAR operation. This article focuses on the key problem of the optimal selection of search facilities, that is often encountered in large-area maritime search practice and urgently needs to be solved in joint aeronautical and maritime search operations. The problem may be abstracted into an optimization model with vessel and aircraft quantitative constraints that fully considers the area of the sea region to be searched, maximum speeds, search capabilities, initial distances of vessels and aircraft from the search area, and maximum endurance of aircraft. By introducing 0-1 decision variables, the search facility selection can be judged and optimized directly and effectively. By analyzing the results with different vessel and aircraft quantities, and taking the relationship between search coverage time and the number of search facilities (cost) into account, the optimal (most economic and feasible) search facility selection scheme can be produced.","optimal model,marine accidents,search capabilities,search facility selection,aircraft quantitative constraints,large-area maritime search practice,Aircraft,Marine vehicles,Mathematical model,optimal selection,integer programming,Planning,Search problems,joint aeronautical,maritime SAR,genetic algorithms,Atmospheric modeling,marine safety,marine engineering,search facility,optimal search facilities selection model,maritime search operations,optimization model,coordinated air-maritime search,Optimization,search problems,aeronautical SAR,aerospace computing,search coverage time,Joint aeronautical and maritime search,"
"vital electronics, the key to the developing dynamic gis for the baltic or other maritime environments","2010","Dynamic GIS can provide geospatial information in real-time in support of first responses to natural disasters (e.g. flooding on the Baltic ecosystem), man-made disasters (e.g. oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico), and for Search and Rescue (SAR) missions. All these scenarios require the integration between the real time data acquisition and dynamic GIS. The proposed Vital Electronic System for Maritime Applications (SYSTEM) integrates: a land or sea-based Data Center; a 'Mother Ship' (used for sensor deployment and local data collection); and a large number of easily deployed, disposable, intercommunicating, and intelligent 'Floaters' (equipped with task-specific sensors). An embedded Vital Electronics Computer composed of a hierarchical network of a large number of wireless PSoC-based GNODEs (configurable at deployment), forms the core of SYSTEM. The Floaters include both task-specific Sensing-only GNODEs and Aggregation GNODEs dedicated to local data aggregation and global communications tasks. Sensing GNODE may be equipped with submerged sensors (e.g. water temperature, pressure, salinity, acidity, passive acoustic, SONAR), and/or above water sensors (e.g. air temperature, proximity, sound, light, thermal IR, passive RF, RADAR). Aggregation GNODEs provide absolute location (e.g. GPS or other means) and also long-range communications with the 'Mother Ship', a satellite or airborne platform, and/or a land-based data center. Ultimately, the data collected by the system can be integrated with reference GIS data (such as existing terrain and sea-bottom maps, as well as other live information.

In this article, an interpretable knowledge-based decision support method is established to guide the ship to make collision avoidance decisions with good seamanship and ordinary practice of seamen using AIS data. First, AIS data is preprocessed and trajectory reconstructed to restore the ship historical navigation state, and a ship encounter identification model is constructed according to the encounter characteristics; Second, a two-stage collision avoidance behavior extraction algorithm is formed to build a behavior knowledge base, and the scenario similarity model is constructed to measure and match similar scenarios based on ship position, motion tendency and collision risk. Then, the Delaunay Triangulation Network is used to fuse ship trajectories of similar scenario to form the collision avoidance path. Finally, a case study is performed using the real AIS data outside Ningbo-Zhoushan Port waters, China, and the effectiveness of the planned path is verified by setting the head-on and crossing situations and comparison between the planned and real paths. Results indicate that the proposed model can extract the ship collision avoidance behavior accurately, and the planned path can ensure navigation safety.","Automatic identification system (AIS),Trajectory fusion,Collision avoidance path planning,Ship collision avoidance behavior,Scenario similarity measurement,"
"sources of the seasonal-trend behaviour and periodicity modulation of 7be air concentration in the atmospheric surface layer observed in southeastern spain","2019","The components and the periodicity characterising airborne 7Be monthly concentration collected in Granada (SE Spain) between 2000 and 2018 are studied. These 19 years of measurements are particularly significant for the 7Be analysis as they cover the complete 24th solar cycle, 2008–2018. A Time Series Decomposition (TSD) technique has been applied to determine the different components present in the dataset: the trend, seasonal and irregular components. Then, the atmospheric parameters (Precipitation (Pp), Relative Humidity (RH), Temperature (Temp), Wind speed (WS), Total Cloudiness (TC), Low Cloudiness (LC)), teleconnection indices and the solar activity (Sun Spot Number, SSN) were used to justify the variability of each component. SSN and the teleconnection indices (Western Mediterranean Oscillation (WeMO), Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) and Quasi Biennial Oscillation (QBO)) are found to have a major impact on the trend component of 7Be. In turn, all the atmospheric parameters were found to have strong impact on the seasonal component. In order to observe the change in the impact of the parameters from the 24th solar cycle (from 2008 to 2018) to the complete time series (starting in 2000), the comparison between the two periods has been carried out. The results show that, over the 24th solar cycle, the SSN impacted predominantly on the trend component, whereas atmospheric parameters showed a slightly higher impact on the seasonal component. In addition, some atmospheric factors (Temp, RH, Pp, TC, LC) appeared to partially affect the irregular component. The analysis of the two phases of the 24th solar cycle shows that the influence of SSN is higher during the descending phase than during the ascending one. This behaviour is opposed to the one found for the 23rd solar cycle, which clarifies the special characteristics of the 24th cycle. Besides that, the Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) analysis was applied in order to extract the possible periodicities characterising 7Be data. The analysis revealed three sets of periodicities. Then, the Wavelet Coherence Analysis (WCA) method was particularly useful to study coherences between 7Be data and teleconnection indices. The 7Be concentrations in the large period (11–14 years) detected by CWT was found to be mainly modulated by WeMO, AMO and QBO, while the NAO modulates the smaller periods.","Wavelet analysis,Teleconnections indices,Time series decomposition,Atmospheric aerosols,Be,"

After exploiting the network characteristics, we formulated and solved the radio resource allocation problem by max-min integer linear programming method. The radio resource allocation fairness in terms of Jain's fairness index was computed and it was compared with round robin and opportunistic methods. Results show that the max-min optimization method performs better than the opportunistic and round robin methods. This result in turn reflects that the max-min optimization method gives us the high minimum best throughput as compared to other two methods considering different ship density scenarios in the sea.

"a neural network-based approach for the detection of heavy precipitation using gnss observations and surface meteorological data","2021","Recent years have witnessed a growing interest in using GNSS observations to detect heavy precipitation. In this study, a neural network-based (NN-based) approach taking seven meteorological variables as input data was developed based on the back propagation (BP) algorithm for detecting heavy precipitation. Apart from the surface meteorological variables of temperature, pressure and relative humidity, the model has also adopted other information such as day-of-year, hour-of-day and GNSS-derived zenith total delay and precipitable water vapor (PWV) as input variables. The feasibility of using these variables for developing the BP-NN-based model was elaborated by conducting the feature analysis of the seven input variables. In addition, the criterion for selecting a proper size of training sample was also briefly investigated by studying the impact and sensibility of the sample lengths in the model. The proposed model was developed using a sample size of an 8-year (2010–2017) period in the summer at a pair of co-located GNSS/weather stations−HKSC-KP in Hong Kong. The use of a long-term data is to “reliably” capture the characteristics of the selected variables. The detection results for the summer months in 2018 and 2019 were then compared against corresponding precipitation records to valid the effectiveness of the newly proposed model. Results of the correct detection and false alarm rates were 94.5 % and 20.8 %, respectively, which were significant improvements compared with the existing models.","Neural network,Zenith total delay (ZTD),Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS),Precipitable water vapor (PWV),Heavy precipitation detection,"
"egnos performances assessment in maritime navigation","2021","The maritime community is increasingly interested to guarantee the safety and security of shipping. In this context, the knowledge of accurate and reliable information about a shipâ€™s position is a fundamental requirement for navigation and for avoiding accidents. This is valid for both maritime navigation and inland navigation. For this reason, the information about Position, Navigation, and Time (PNT) is necessary for the safety and efficiency of ship movement, especially in high-density traffic areas such as port entrances, channels or inland waterways. In this context, the GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) has become the main source of PNT for maritime navigation. However, in some critical conditions, the use of GNSS alone have some shortfalls, especially in coastal navigation, with the consequent need to enhance accuracy and integrity information. Such enhancement can be available from augmentation techniques. Among them, the users can take advantage of Satellite-Based Augmentation Systems (SBASs).

"advances in ne-atlantic coastal sea level change monitoring by delay doppler altimetry","2021","A significant part of the World population lives in the coastal zone, which is affected by sea level rise and extreme events. Consistent and precise new measurements are needed to assess and predict these changes. New altimeter missions equipped with Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) mode provide more accurate sea level heights. In this work we analyse their impacts on the estimation of the coastal sea level variability in the last 10 km. First, by analysing various standard and improved SAR altimetric products it is found that SAR altimetry will reduce the minimum usable distance from five to three kilometres. The best performance is achieved with the SAR coastal retrackers SAMOSA+ and SAMOSA++. A comparable performance is obtained in low resolution Reduced SAR (RDSAR) mode with the Spatio-Temporal Altimeter sub-waveform Retracker (STAR). In both cases, sea level heights are recovered with 4 cm accuracy up to 3 km from the coast at the Helgoland station, and the accuracy does not decrease with the distance to coast. In estuaries and coastal zones with hight tidal regimes, the discrepancy between altimetry and in-situ observations remains large (40 cm standard deviation difference (stdd) with SAR-SAM+). CryoSat-2 and Sentinel-3A have similar accuracy, despite their different repeat cycle and sampling, which require a different post-processing. The monthly coastal variability from the SAR-SAM+ product agrees most favourably with the NEMO-WAM model, with stdd 3.9 and correlation 0.90 for Sentinel-3A. Instead, the maximum departure between altimeter data products is between SAR-SAM+ and RDSAR-TALES CryoSat-2 data (stdd 2.3 and correlation 0.96). An average trend of about 3 ± 1.3 mm/yr has been detected using low resolution altimetry at ninetheen in-situ stations along the German coast over time intervals longer than 15 years. The difference of the trends of altimetry and tide gauge co-located time-series (al-tg) agrees with the GNSS rates within 1.5 mm/yr at half of the co-located locations, with error of al-tg larger than the error of the GPS rate by a factor bigger than two. The larger departure between monthly tide gauge and LRM altimetric time-series as between tide gauge and SAR altimetric time-series confirms the higher accuracy of SAR data compared to LRM. Finally, the sea level trends of the merged LRM and SAR altimetry time-series are consistent with the LRM trends.","Sea level change,Tide gauge,Delay-Doppler Altimetry,"

"footprints of fishing vessels in chinese waters based on automatic identification system data","2022","The importance and difficulty of large-scale quantitative analysis of fishing vessel footprints and fishing intensities with high resolution have received more and more attention and recognition in fishery research. In this study, a framework for identifying and analyzing fishing footprints and activities based on AIS data is proposed. The first step is the AIS data pre-processing. Through the screening and cleaning of AIS data, noise data such as non-fishing vessel trajectories are removed to retain only fishing vessel trajectories. The second step is the behavior detection of fishing vessels. Based on the proposed speed identification method, the trajectory of a fishing vessel is divided into three states: Fishing, stationary, and sailing. The third step is the calculation of fishing vessel activities. An adjacent point mean method is proposed to calculate the fishing time of each fishing point. In addition, two simple and efficient quantitative indicators, namely unit cell activity frequency (UCAF) and unit cell fishing time (UCFT), are proposed to quantify the activities of fishing vessels. The last step is the spatial and temporal analysis of fishing activities. The global Moran's index and Getis-Ord Gi* index are used to quantitatively describe the global spatio-temporal distribution and local spatio-temporal hotspots of fishing activities. Based on >130 million AIS data from 2015 to 2016, the footprints of fishing vessels in the waters of China's exclusive economic zone (EEZ) were analyzed and the 0.01° × 0.01° high-resolution fishing vessel activity distribution maps and fishing time distribution maps were generated. It is found that the footprints of fishing vessels in China's EEZ waters have a positive spatial correlation, and the areas with high fishing intensities are clustered in the coastal waters of Shandong Province, Zhejiang Province, Fujian Province and Guangdong Province. The research results can be used for fishing area identification, fishery policy making, and sustainable fisheries development.","Quantitative analysis,Spatio-temporal analysis,Fisheries management,Chinese fishery,Fishing activity,Trajectory analysis,"
"crustal strain in the southern alps, france, 1948–1998","2000","Active tectonics in the Western Alps is revealed by a moderate level of seismic activity and geological evidences for Quaternary deformation. We present new geodetic determinations of the current strain rates in the southern part of the Western Alps, that complement existing results in Provence, the Jura, and the Subalpine and Belledone massifs around Grenoble. We combined first- and second-order triangulation data collected in 1948 with global positioning system (GPS) data collected in 1998. We estimate shear strain rates of 0.1–0.2μradyr−1 over distances on the order of 30km, significantly different from zero in most of the network. We obtain NW–SE to N–S compressive shear strain directions over most of the area, in agreement with the seismological and geological data. These geodetic estimates correspond to long-term overall N–S to NW–SE shortening of 2–4mmyr−1 over the study area, on the same order as the far-field shortening measured by continuous GPS on the Grasse–Torino baseline (−2.0±0.5mmyr−1), that incorporates our geodetic network. These results provide new constraints on interseismic strain in the Western Alps.","Alps,active deformation,triangulation,global positioning system,"
"geology of the río de la plata and the surrounding areas of argentina and uruguay related to the evolution of the atlantic margin","2018","An integrated study of geological and geophysical data of the Río de la Plata region and its relation to the evolution of the Atlantic passive margin is herein described. This characterization is based on the available geological and geophysical information and on the correlation of the southern end of the best-known Santa Lucía Basin in Uruguay to the Salado Basin in Argentina, and their connection through the Quilmes Trough. Furthermore, a new Meso-Cenozoic depocenter is characterized and identified as Recalada Trough, subparallely aligned to the Quilmes Trough and separated from it by the Magdalena-Montevideo High. Both sedimentary fillings present ENE-WSW trending main axes and reach an average thickness of almost 2000 m. This suggests an evolution from a triple junction where interconnected extensional arms developed, which have had common Mesozoic tectosedimentary histories related to the early opening of the Atlantic Ocean. Based on the geophysical and geological evidence, the previously accepted existence in the Río de la Plata of a first-order structural feature along the international border between Argentina and Uruguay, associated to an ENE-WSW trending tectonic high, identified as Martín García, is unjustified. The tectonic evolution of the Atlantic margin in front of the Río de la Plata estuary is the consequence of a long deformation history starting in the Precambrian up to recent times. Each Precambrian, Paleozoic, Mesozoic and Cenozoic tectonic scenario adds different weak trends on the continental crust, which control the evolution of the sedimentary depocenters. The presence of these tectosedimentary records influence the bathymetric control of the Río de la Plata and the dynamics of the recent estuarine deposits. The Meso-Cenozoic sedimentary infill is estimated to comprise considerable ranges of sandstones and conglomerates associated with faulted blocks of the crystalline basement, with expected petrophysical conditions oscillating in the order of 12%–15% of effective porosity and with expected traps of the stratigraphic and combined (closing against faulting) type, and overlapped by fine sediments with excellent quality as seals. The economic significance of these sedimentary volumes lies in their yet unexplored potential as natural fluid reservoirs (hydrocarbons and groundwater), of great importance due to their strategic position near the large urban areas of Buenos Aires and Montevideo.","Meso-Cenozoic depocenters,Río de la Plata,Rifting South Atlantic,Basement,"
"a multi-scalar approach to marine survey and underwater archaeological site prospection in murujuga, western australia","2021","During the past 20,000 years approximately one-quarter of the continental landmass of Australia was inundated by postglacial sea-level rise, submerging archaeological evidence for use of these landscapes. Underwater archaeological sites can offer substantial insights into past lifeways and adaptations to rapidly changing environments, however the vast scale of inundation presents a range of challenges in discovering such sites. Here we present a suite of methods as a model methodology for locating sites in submerged landscapes. Priority areas for survey were based on palaeoenvironmental contexts determined from the onshore archaeological record. Remote sensing was used to identify seabed composition and indicators of palaeolandscapes where high potential for human occupation and site preservation could be identified in Murujuga (or the Dampier Archipelago), northwestern Australia. Target locations were surveyed by scientific divers to test for the presence of archaeological material. Application of this methodology resulted in the discovery of the first two confirmed sub-tidal ancient Aboriginal archaeological sites on Australia's continental shelf. Survey methods are discussed for their combined value to identify different classes of landscapes and archaeological features to support future underwater site prospection.","Submerged landscape archaeology,Bathymetric LiDAR,Marine geophysics,Underwater cultural heritage,Coastal geomorphology,"

"ship trajectory uncertainty prediction based on a gaussian process model","2019","The uncertainty of ship trajectory prediction is addressed. In particular, a probabilistic trajectory prediction model is proposed that describes the uncertainty in future positions along the ship trajectories by continuous probability distributions. The ship motion prediction is decomposed into lateral and longitudinal directions, and position probabilities are calculated along these two directions. A data-driven non-parametric Bayesian model based on a Gaussian Process is proposed to describe the lateral motion uncertainty, while the longitudinal uncertainty results from the uncertainty on the ship acceleration along the route. The parameters of the probabilistic models are derived off-line based on historic trajectory information provided by Automatic Identification System (AIS) data. The model is then applied to predict the trajectory uncertainty in real time by iteratively updating the prior probability models based on new observed AIS data. Moreover, a sequential Cholesky decomposition algorithm is applied in this study to reduce the computational effort required by the Gaussian Process modelling. Three months of AIS data are used to train and test the proposed probabilistic trajectory prediction model. The results obtained show that the proposed method has high prediction accuracy and meets the demands of real-time applications.","Uncertainty modelling,AIS data,Gaussian process,Trajectory prediction,"

"humpback whale (megaptera novaeangliae) distribution and movements in the vicinity of south georgia and the south sandwich islands marine protected area","2022","Humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) are showing strong recovery from commercial whaling in the western South Atlantic. In this region, humpback whales migrate annually from their winter breeding grounds off the coast of Brazil to their summer feeding grounds near to the Polar Front, an area that includes the waters of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands (SGSSI). This latter region includes a Marine Protected Area (MPA), which has been developed to ensure sustainable management of fisheries, and protection of foraging predators. To date, management measures within the MPA have primarily been concerned with foraging predators that rely upon Antarctic krill, including for a number of previously over-exploited species. With humpback whales increasing in the western South Atlantic, understandingnderstanding their spatiotemporal distribution within the MPA is important as it will help inform management particularly in respect of interactions between humpback whales and the regional fishery for Antarctic krill. Here we develop habitat models from the distribution and movement patterns of 16 individuals at their high-latitude feeding grounds, south of 50°S. We show that whale habitat use varies throughout the foraging period. Upon reaching their feeding ground, whales use the area to the east of the South Sandwich Islands, moving westward into the centre of the Scotia Arc and towards South Georgia during the high summer, and then expanding back towards the east in the winter. Based on these findings, we discuss the implications for the future, including necessary research required for underpinning management.","Marine protected area,Habitat use,Antarctic,Whale,South Georgia,"
"extraction of fault component from abnormal sound in diesel engines using acoustic signals","2016","In this paper a method for extracting fault components from abnormal acoustic signals and automatically diagnosing diesel engine faults is presented. The method named dislocation superimposed method (DSM) is based on the improved random decrement technique (IRDT), differential function (DF) and correlation analysis (CA). The aim of DSM is to linearly superpose multiple segments of abnormal acoustic signals because of the waveform similarity of faulty components. The method uses sample points at the beginning of time when abnormal sound appears as the starting position for each segment. In this study, the abnormal sound belonged to shocking faulty type; thus, the starting position searching method based on gradient variance was adopted. The coefficient of similar degree between two same sized signals is presented. By comparing with a similar degree, the extracted fault component could be judged automatically. The results show that this method is capable of accurately extracting the fault component from abnormal acoustic signals induced by faulty shocking type and the extracted component can be used to identify the fault type.","Cross correlation,Auto-correlation,Dislocation superimposed method,Random decrement technique,Engine fault,"

"tectonic applications of magnetic susceptibility and its anisotropy","1997","Anisotropy of low field magnetic susceptibility (AMS) is a versatile petrofabric tool. For magnetite, AMS primarily defines grain-shape anisotropy; for other minerals, AMS expresses crystallographic control on magnetic properties. Thus, we may infer the orientation-distribution of a dominant mineral from the AMS of a rock. AMS principal directions can record current directions from sediment, flow-directions from magma, finite-strain directions from tectonized rocks and stress-directions from low-strain, low-temperature, neotectonic environments. AMS measurements may reveal some aspects of the strain-path, where carefully selected. For example, we may compare different parts of a heterogeneously strained domain, different minerals in a homogeneously strained site, AMS with schistosity/mineral lineation, and AMS with remanence-anisotropy. Such measurements isolate the orientation-distributions of different minerals, adding a temporal scale to the kinematic sequence. Normally, we can interpret the principal directions of AMS distributions as a physically significant direction, such as a current direction, magmatic flow or finite-strain axis. However, calibrating the AMS ellipsoid shape against the magnitude of the controlling physical process is very difficult. Primarily, this is because the shape of the AMS ellipsoid combines contributions from several minerals whose individual AMS ellipsoids are of different shape. Thus, small variations in the proportions of minerals change the shape of the rock's AMS ellipsoid, even if the alignment process were of constant intensity. In deformed rocks, AMS is more strain-sensitive than calcite twinning or the alignment of calcite or quartz c-axes. Not all AMS fabrics relate to crystallographic or grain alignment. First, displacement fabrics generate AMS where an isotropic matrix of high susceptibility displaces unevenly spaced objects of low susceptibility and suitable scales. Second, AMS location fabrics occur where sub-isometric magnetite grains are close enough, in certain directions, for their demagnetizing fields to interact. This accounts for the AMS of many magnetite-dominated signals where there is no aligned magnetite. Third, the AMS of single-domain magnetite is inverse to shape so that such grains may oppose the AMS contribution of parallel minerals. Finally, transitional sedimentary-tectonic or magmatic-tectonic fabrics yield smeared, temporal sequences of AMS principal directions that cannot be immediately attributed to a single alignment process. These transitional AMS ellipsoids mix primary and secondary AMS components, making it difficult to characterize either component. However, such fabric combinations may permit us to recognize the sense of shearing in flow processes.","tectonic stress,AMS,tectonic deformation,magnetic susceptibility,anisotropy,crystal or grain alignment,petrofabrics,"
"hot moments and hotspots of cyanobacteria hyperblooms in the curonian lagoon (se baltic sea) revealed via remote sensing-based retrospective analysis","2021","A temporally and spatially detailed historical (1985–2018) analysis of cyanobacteria blooms was performed in the Curonian Lagoon (Lithuania, Russia), the largest coastal lagoon in the Baltic Sea. Satellite data allowed the mapping of cyanobacteria surface accumulations, so-called “scums”, and of chlorophyll-a concentration. The 34-year time series shows a tendency towards later occurrence (October–November) of the cyanobacteria scum presence, whereas the period of its onset (June–July) remains relatively constant. The periods when scums are present, “hot moments”, have been consistently increasing in duration since 2008. The differences in the starting, ending and annual duration of cyanobacteria blooms have been significantly altered by hydro-meteorological conditions (river discharge, water temperature, and wind conditions) and their year-round patterns. The most important environmental factors that determined the temporal changes of the scum presence and area were the standing stock of cyanobacteria and the ambient wind conditions. The “hotspots”, the areas where the blooms most likely occur, were distributed in the south-southwestern and central parts of the lagoon. The least affected areas were the northern part, which is connected to the coastal waters of the Baltic Sea, and the Nemunas River delta region. The longstanding, well-established spatial patterns of cyanobacteria blooms were linked to hydrodynamic features, namely water renewal time and current patterns, and to potential nutrient sources that included muddy sediments and the locations of colonies of piscivorous birds. Our findings confirmed that the annual and seasonal variations of cyanobacteria blooms and their regulation are a complex issue due to interactions between multiple factors over spatially and temporally broad scales. Despite great progress in the prevention and control of eutrophication and cyanobacteria blooms, the lagoon is still considered to be in a poor ecological status. This work provides a new and missing understanding on the spatial and temporal extent of cyanobacteria blooms and the factors that govern them. Such an understanding can help in planning management strategies, forecasting the magnitude and severity of blooms under changing nutrient loads and potential climate scenarios.","Curonian Lagoon,Remote sensing,Eutrophication,Cyanobacteria scum,Drivers of hyperblooms,"
"advance learning technique for the electricity market attack detection","2022","The false data injection (FDI) attacks in the AC smart microgrid (SMG) and the solution for detecting attacks on distributed energy sources in the SMG are discussed in the present paper. As the input indices for the deep machine learning (DML) algorithm, wavelet singular amounts are used as an alternative method of detecting FDI attacks (FDIAs). By means of the suggested approach, a specified error is used to adjust the precision factors of the wavelet transform and subsequently, singular value decomposition is used to retrieve features from wavelet coefficients. The wavelet singular values in switching surfaces of current and voltage are used to determine the indexes used for DML and diagnosing FDIA. Detecting FDIA with great precision is the main goal of the suggested detection plan. A simulation study using MATLAB/Simulink is conducted on SMG to demonstrate the performance of the suggested approach.","False data injection,Wavelet transform,Deep learning,Market price,Smart microgrid,"
"system controls of coastal and open ocean oxygen depletion","2021","The epoch of the Anthropocene, a period during which human activity has been the dominant influence on climate and the environment, has witnessed a decline in oxygen concentrations and an expansion of oxygen-depleted environments in both coastal and open ocean systems since the middle of the 20th century. This paper provides a review of system-specific drivers of low oxygen in a range of case studies representing marine systems in the open ocean, on continental shelves, in enclosed seas and in the coastal environment. Identification of similar and contrasting responses within and across system types and corresponding oxygen regimes is shown to be informative both in understanding and isolating key controlling processes and provides a sound basis for predicting change under anticipated future conditions. Case studies were selected to achieve a balance in system diversity and global coverage. Each case study describes system attributes, including the present-day oxygen environment and known trends in oxygen concentrations over time. Central to each case study is the identification of the physical and biogeochemical processes that determine oxygen concentrations through the tradeoff between ventilation and respiration. Spatial distributions of oxygen and time series of oxygen data provide the opportunity to identify trends in oxygen availability and have allowed various drivers of low oxygen to be distinguished through correlative and causative relationships. Deoxygenation results from a complex interplay of hydrographic and biogeochemical processes and the superposition of these processes, some additive and others subtractive, makes attribution to any particular driver challenging. System-specific models are therefore required to achieve a quantitative understanding of these processes and of the feedbacks between processes at varying scales.","Deoxygenation,Eutrophication,Respiration,Global warming,Stratification,Ventilation,"
"upper air thermal inversion and their impact on the summer monsoon rainfall over goa – a case study","2018","Profiles of periodic GPS Radiosonde ascends collected from a station at the west coast of India (Goa) during summer monsoon months (June to September) of 2009 and 2013 have been used to analyze the thermal inversion statistics at various heights and their repercussions on the regional weather is studied. The interaction of contrasting air masses over the northern Arabian Sea often produces a two layer structure in the lower 5000 m close to the coastal station with warm and dusty air (Summer Shamal) occupying the space above the cool and moist Low Level Jet (LLJ) by virtue of their density differences. The warm air intrusion creates low lapse rate pockets above LLJ and modifies the gravitational stability strong enough to inhibit convection. It is observed that the inversion occurring in the lower 3000 m layer with an optimum layer thickness of 100–200 m has profound influence on the weather beneath it. We demonstrated the validity of the proposed hypothesis by analyzing the collocated data from radiosonde, lidar and the rain gauge during 16th July 2013 as a case study. The lidar depolarization ratio provides evidence to support the two layer structure in the lidar backscatter image. The presence of dust noticed in the two layer interface hints the intrusion of warm air that makes the atmosphere stable enough to suppress convection. The daily rainfall record of 2013 surprisingly coincides with the patterns of a regional break like situation centered at 16th July 2013 in Goa.","Low Level Jet,Two layer structure,Warm air intrusion,Thermal inversion,Monsoon,"

"the small world of global marine crude oil trade based on crude oil tanker flows","2022","Global marine crude oil trade is a direct reflection of global economic trends. This study uses the real-world historical ship automatic identification system (AIS) data from 2014 to 2017 to explore the flows of crude oil tanker trade between ports and construct a port-node global crude oil trade model.

"maritime smuggling detection and mitigation using risk-aware hybrid robotic sensor networks","2017","With the rise of more resourceful unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), their inclusion into robotic sensor networks (RSNs) is inevitable. The highly mobile nature of UAVs allows greater monitoring capabilities, making them most suitable for RSNs. Compared to traditional nodes in RSNs, UAVs suffer even more from communication disruptions and energy depletion, must often rapidly determine actions for themselves, and consequently require more autonomy. Prior work has been done in wireless sensor network (WSN)/aerial sensor network (ASN) coordination in a few applications such as protecting critical infrastructure, restoring communication between nodes, and healing networks, while other work has been accomplished on using the UAV network for augmenting the monitoring capabilities of WSNs. We introduce a novel methodology to integrate UAVs into RSNs for monitoring purposes by formulating the problem in the context of a risk management framework (RMF). This methodology allows a more precise risk feature classification and a more efficient task allocation for the ground network by utilizing the monitoring capabilities of the UAVs to informatively warn the RSN of any incoming events. We also present a fictitious but credible maritime smuggling scenario near the Port of Barcelona based on expert knowledge, and apply the methodology to detect and mitigate maritime smuggling. The network's behaviour is traced throughout the scenario and is repeated with civilian ships to assure that they are not flagged as smugglers.

"the geochemistry of gem opals as evidence of their origin","2008","Seventy-seven gem opals from ten countries were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) through a dilution process, in order to establish the nature of the impurities. The results are correlated to the mode of formation and physical properties and are instrumental in establishing the geographical origin of a gem opal. The geochemistry of an opal is shown to be dependant mostly on the host rock, at least for examples from Mexico and Brazil, even if modified by weathering processes. In order of decreasing concentration, the main impurities present are Al, Ca, Fe, K, Na, and Mg (more than 500 ppm). Other noticeable elements in lesser amounts are Ba, followed by Zr, Sr, Rb, U, and Pb. For the first time, geochemistry helps to discriminate some varieties of opals. The Ba content, as well as the chondrite-normalized REE pattern, are the keys to separating sedimentary opals (Ba>110 ppm, Eu and Ce anomalies) from volcanic opals (Ba<110 ppm, no Eu or Ce anomaly). The Ca content, and to a lesser extent that of Mg, Al, K and Nb, helps to distinguish gem opals from different volcanic environments. The limited range of concentrations for all elements in precious (play-of-color) compared to common opals, indicates that this variety must have very specific, or more restricted, conditions of formation. We tentatively interpreted the presence of impurities in terms of crystallochemistry, even if opal is a poorly crystallized or amorphous material. The main replacement is the substitution of Si4+ by Al3+ and Fe3+. The induced charge imbalance is compensated chiefly by Ca2+, Mg2+, Mn2+, Ba2+, K+, and Na+. In terms of origin of color, greater concentrations of iron induce darker colors (from yellow to “chocolate brown”). This element inhibits luminescence for concentrations above 1000 ppm, whereas already a low content in U (≤1 ppm) induces a green luminescence.","Opal,Trace element analysis,Chemical composition,Genesis,ICP-MS,"
"different climate responses of spruce and pine growth in northern european russia","2019","We report new data on tree-ring growth in northern European Russia, a region with a hitherto relatively sparse tree-ring network. We explore its associations with climate variability. Areas, sampling locations and trees were selected for representativeness rather than climate sensitivity. Using tree rings from 651 conifers from six widely dispersed areas we show strong intercorrelation between trees within each major conifer species within and between areas. Regional composite tree-ring series for spruce and pine contain a major fraction of decadal and multidecadal variability. The most likely driver of this common variability is interannual to multidecadal climate variability. Gridded monthly instrumental climate data for the period 1902–2008, particularly mean temperature and total precipitation, were tested as predictors of each local species-specific tree-ring site chronology. The most consistent pattern emerged for spruce at all but the southernmost area. Cool and moist summers the year before growth were consistent drivers of spruce ring growth throughout the period, with no change in recent decades. Self-calibrating Palmer Drought Severity Index for prior summer was also a strong and consistent driver of spruce ring growth. For pine, there was a weaker but similarly stable association between larger rings and warm, moist conditions, in this case in the current summer. These associations were also identified at multidecadal time scales, particularly for spruce. On the other hand, the specific role of moisture variability in determining interannual to multidecadal variability in tree growth in this high latitude region raises questions about the relative vulnerability of spruce and pine there under global warming.","Taiga,Climate,Pine,Tree-ring width,Larch,Spruce,"
"detection of signals linked to climate change, land-cover change and climate oscillators in tropical montane cloud forests","2021","Tropical Montane Cloud Forests (TMCFs) form biodiverse communities that are characterized by frequent occurrence of low-level clouds from which they capture a substantial proportion of their precipitation — here referred to as occult precipitation. TMCFs provide important ecosystem services, in particular the supply of water to their wider surroundings. Throughout the tropics (here 23.5∘ S to 23.5∘ N), they are under pressure from deforestation and poor land management which leads to loss of both forest area and species diversity, and reduces their capture of occult precipitation. Climate change may also reduce occult precipitation in TMCFs since the cloud base may lift in response to higher temperatures — the ‘lifting cloud-base hypothesis’. These threats to TMCFs are well understood, but their quantitative assessment is hampered by 1) uncertainty in the location and spatial extent of TMCFs and 2) limited availability of representative meteorological data. We use a Random Forest Classifier — informed by topographic data, MODIS vegetation data, TRMM precipitation data and ERA5-Land and MERRA-2 reanalysis products — to estimate the spatial distribution and extent of TMCFs (2.1 × 106 km2 ± 0.5 × 106 km2). We analyze temporal changes in climate, tree-cover and greenness of TMCFs over the past two to four decades to detect 1) multi-decadal trends, and 2) associations with the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD). Evidence for the ‘lifting cloud-base hypothesis’ in reanalysis products was inconsistent across the tropics; a lifting of the cloud base during the past four decades occurred for about 20% of TMCFs, predominantly in the Americas and a few locations in Africa, while in Asia a downward movement of the cloud base was found. However, these results in part depend on the bias correction applied to the reanalyses. Changes in TMCF tree cover and greenness varied by continent; in Africa in 50% of TMCFs tree cover declined, whereas TMCFs in the Americas and in Asia exhibited a net increase in tree cover, despite a reduction in tree cover in ~20% of these TMCFs. An important limitation of the tree-cover data is that they do not distinguish between natural tree cover and agro-forestry. ENSO signals were more strongly present in precipitation in American and Asian TMCFs, whereas IOD signals were stronger in TMCF temperature and dewpoint temperature across the tropics. ENSO and IOD signals were approximately equally important for precipitation in African TMCFs and in cloud-base height across the tropics. An arbitrary warming of 1 ∘C and a 100 m lifting of the cloud base, in accordance with the ‘lifting cloud hypothesis’, imposed on the Random Forest classifier showed a decline in the extent of TMCFs in the Americas and Africa, but an increase in Asia — mostly at the expense of evergreen broadleaf forests. The greater vulnerability of TMCFs in Africa may be linked to their more isolated and scattered distribution across the continent and drier conditions compared to a more continuous distribution and wetter conditions in the Americas and Asia.","IOD,ENSO,TRMM,Tropical Montane Cloud Forests,Reanalysis,MODIS,Climate change,Cloud-base height,"
"maritime traffic probabilistic prediction based on ship motion pattern extraction","2022","This paper proposes a novel maritime traffic prediction method based on ship motion pattern extraction, considering ship destination prediction and ship trajectory prediction within a specific route. To extract ship motion patterns from historical Automatic Identification System data, traffic departure-arrival areas are determined based on the Order Points to Identify the Clustering Structure algorithm and ship trajectories following the same itinerary are clustered. A maritime traffic network abstraction consisting of nodes that represent waypoint areas and navigational legs is constructed to represent the maritime traffic at a larger scale. Multinomial Logistic Regression and Gaussian Process regression models are developed and applied for predicting probabilistically the ships’ destinations and their trajectories along the ship route, respectively. Based on these models, the uncertainty on the ship's future position can be estimated given its current state. The proposed method is capable of long-term ship position prediction and provides information on the maritime traffic 10, 30 and 60 min ahead when the method is applied to all ships navigating in a study area. The presented method may assist maritime authorities to improve the efficiency of maritime traffic surveillance and to develop strategies to improve navigation safety.","Maritime traffic,Maritime traffic prediction,Gaussian Process regression models,Ship motion pattern,Multinomial Logistic Regression models,AIS data,"
"use of the automatic identification system (ais) for maritime domain awareness (mda)","2005","The Automatic Identification System (AIS) was developed primarily as a tool for maritime safety - vessel collision avoidance, use by Vessel Traffic Services (VTS) and as a means for littoral states to get information on vessels operating near their coasts. AIS equipment aboard vessels continuously and autonomously transmits information about the vessel including its identity, position, course and speed to enhance safety. This information has also come to be seen by the U. S. Coast Guard as a critical tool in enhancing Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) in support of all Coast Guard missions. MDA is the effective understanding of anything associated with the global maritime environment that could affect the security, safety, economy, or environment of the United States. To achieve MDA, the Coast Guard must collect as much information as possible on activities occurring in the maritime domain. A large part of this activity relates to the movement of vessels, therefore detection, classification, identification and monitoring of vessels is a key component of MDA. The Coast Guard believes that AIS can provide a critical part of vessel tracking needs to build maritime domain awareness.","vessel identity,Broadcasting,maritime safety,maritime domain awareness,US Coast Guard,vessel collision avoidance,Global Positioning System,vessel speed,Information security,Radio transmitters,vessel tracking,Vessel Traffic Services,Application software,marine safety,Automatic Identification System,Collision avoidance,vessel position,Weather forecasting,Safety devices,vessel movement,vessel classification,maritime environment,vessel course,Marine safety,Navigation,marine vehicles,security,tracking,oceanographic techniques,"
"the ayia varvara formation of sw cyprus: a product of complex collisional tectonics","1992","The Ayia Varvara Formation is a wedge of amphibole schists and intercalated metasediments within the intensely deformed pre-upper Maastrichtian volcanosedimentary Mamonia Complex. All contacts are steep faults against Upper Triassic transitional to alkaline lavas with reefoidal limestones, subalkaline depleted Troodos-type lavas, and serpentinised harzburgite. Ophiolite-related metamorphics are believed to have been formed by dynamothermal processes, beneath young oceanic crust during emplacement. Characteristically, such rocks might be expected to show a decrease of metamorphic grade away from the contact. Mineral analyses from the Ayia Varvara metamorphics, however, show no systematic variations that would indicate a metamorphic gradient. Hornblende remains generally calcic and of tschermakitic hornblende composition with an almost complete substitution of Mg and Fe2+, suggesting disequilibrium. Plagioclase is essentially albitic and remains so for a distance of some 800 m from the harzburgite contact. Trace element analyses of the amphibolites and surrounding extrusives define four lava types. Types 1–3 are transitional to alkaline intraplate lavas believed to be remnants of intraoceanic islands and atolls. Type 4-lavas are extremely depleted in the HFS elements and are very similar to the Arakapas transform-fault lavas. The amphibolites have, in part, a trace-element geochemistry that is close to mid-ocean ridge basalts (MORB), a type that has not previously been recorded from Cyprus. The small area around Ayia Varvara records a long and complicated tectonic history that provides an insight into the evolution and emplacement of the Troodos ophiolite. The Mamonia Complex is interpreted as a passive margin sequence with intra-oceanic islands that was accreted onto a Late Cretaceous north-dipping subduction zone. Suprasubduction spreading produced the Troodos ophiolite and associated fracture zones. Spreading and subduction ceased in the late Maastrichtian when the newly-formed Troodos crust underwent a 90° anticlockwise rotation which juxtaposed Mamonia and Troodos (Arakapas) fracture zone rocks along arcuate, steep, strike-slip faults. At least some of the Ayia Varvara metamorphic rocks most likely represent Triassic oceanic crust and sediments metamorphosed during subduction by the overriding young Troodos crust.",""
"validation of underwater acoustic-based navigation and geophysical mapping with an autonomous surface vehicle","2018","This paper addresses the field applications of an autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) for the development of underwater navigation and mapping systems. The ASV was developed on a catamaran by integrating various sensors and systems, including power and electrical propulsion, navigation and control, and communication devices. The authors are currently working on the development of acoustic-based navigation and geophysical mapping systems for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and an ASV is used for its preliminary validation. As ASVs can provide georeferenced (i.e., GPS) data, the performance of the developed navigation and mapping algorithms can be efficiently estimated. In the field test, the ASV performs two tasks: underwater acoustic-source searching and underwater geomagnetic-field-data gathering. Underwater acoustic data were used to validate the acoustic-based underwater navigation approach, and geomagnetic data were applied to build an underwater geophysical map. This paper presents the development process of the ASV and its practical application, along with the underwater navigation and mapping results.","ASV (Autonomous surface vehicles),geomagnetic field,acoustic based underwater navigation,underwater mapping,"
"sensor information fusion architecture for virtual maritime environment","2012","This paper presents a ongoing research on generic sensor fusion architecture and its application to a maritime surveillance system. The importance of information fusion for various sensor types and specialized sensor fusion systems in various domains are discussed. In sensor fusion, centralized versus decentralized refers to where the fusion of the data occurs. In centralized fusion, the clients simply forward all of the data to a central location, and some entity at the central location is responsible for correlating and fusing the data. In this research we intend to correlate multiple maritime sensors such as RADAR, AIS, and other electronic object detection systems. Sri Lanka Navy has myriad of surveillance information sources such as AIS (Automatic Identification System), RADAR (Radio Aid Detection and Ranging), SONAR (Sound Navigation and Ranging), MSTT, HFSWR, AVL (Automatic Vessel Locating), HF Communication, Intelligence Data ect. So it is obvious that an information fusion methodology is needed to harness the effectiveness of multiple sensor information. An object identification pipeline is conceptualized such that an unknown object in the maritime domain is detected reducing the uncertainty of obtained information. The radical new virtual reality application has been developed to visualize the information fused from sensors and discussed in depth in addition to the introduction of the fusion process. The technologies used in developing the virtual world and incorporating the real time information in to the virtual world is presented in simplified modal for the purpose of clarity. Also design aspects and some experimental analysis developed in an applied project at the Sri Lanka Navy intended to demonstrate fusion technologies in this environment through an operative prototype are presented.","object identification pipeline,sensor fusion,virtual reality,virtual reality application,maritime sensor,operative prototype,Solid modeling,data visualisation,Mobile communication,sensor information fusion architecture,centralized data fusion,object detection,Networked information processing,Radar tracking,fused information visualization,virtual maritime surveillance system,Computational modeling,central location,Tactical display,video surveillance,virtual world,Information fusion,oceanographic techniques,"
"a lightweight authentication scheme for 6g-iot enabled maritime transport system","2023","The Sixth-Generation (6G) mobile network has the potential to provide not only traditional communication services but also additional processing, caching, sensing, and control capabilities to a massive number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Meanwhile, a 6G mobile network may provide global coverage and diverse quality-of-service provisioning to the Maritime Transportation System (MTS) when enabled through satellite systems. Although modern MTS has gained significant benefits from Internet of Things (IoT) and 6G technologies, threats and challenges in terms of security and privacy have also been grown substantially. Tracking the location of vessels, GPS spoofing, unauthorized access to data, and message tampering are some of the potential security and privacy vulnerabilities in the 6G-IoT enabled MTS. In this article, we propose a lightweight authentication protocol for a 6G-IoT enabled maritime transportation system to efficiently assist and ensure the security and privacy of maritime transportation systems.

The existing cooperative maritime traffic monitoring relies on the shipborne automatic identification system (AIS), which is now confronting severe security threats due to the vulnerabilities of AIS at both the implementation and protocol levels. In this article, the possibility of passive AIS signal localization using low Earth orbit satellite constellations is investigated, which provides a more reliable vessel position determination. To this end, the article first presents an overview on two categories of passive localization methods. Realizations of these methods on the satellite-based AIS emitter position determination are then demonstrated and compared.

"long-term impact of continental and maritime airflow on aerosol environment and rain microstructure near landâ€“sea boundary","2022","The present study deals with the interplay of multiple atmospheric processes in changing the microphysical properties of precipitation during the pre-monsoon season (Marchâ€“May) using the long-term experimental data of raindrop size distributions (DSDs) spanning over 15 years (2005â€“2019) obtained at an urban tropical location, Kolkata (22.57Â°N, 88.37Â°E), near the landâ€“sea boundary. The changing pattern of air mass flows from the maritime and continental region, which contribute to the formation of precipitation processes, has been responsible for the varying characteristics of rain. Changes in raindrop sizes are related to aerosol properties, cloud features, temperature, and relative humidity that change mass-weighted mean drop diameter ( $D_{m}$ ) differently in low and high rain rate regimes.  $D_{m}$  has shown an increasing trend over time for low rain rates (< 15 mm/h), but a decreasing trend for high rain rate regimes (â‰¥15 mm/h). An increase (decrease) in mean temperature (relative humidity) below the atmospheric boundary layer (< 1.6 km) has enhanced the evaporation of small raindrops and altered rain microphysical features. Based on satellite observations, it has been found that the increasing aerosol optical depth (AOD) has been accompanied by an increase in cloud effective radius (CER), resulting in the anti-Twomey effect, which is due to the dominance of maritime influence over continental activities. Because of the predominant maritime activities, sea salt aerosols have a greater presence, causing an increase in CER, which consequently prevents raindrops from becoming large enough before they fall, thereby reducing  $D_{m}$  at high rainfall rates.","sea salt aerosols,clouds,continental region,rain,altered rain microphysical features,temperature,cloud features,rain drop sizes,atmospheric optics,atmospheric boundary layer,Clouds,pre-monsoon season,continental activities,maritime airflow,change mass-weighted mean drop diameter,air mass,precipitation dynamics,aerosol properties,precipitation process,aerosol environment,raindrops,predominant maritime activities,rain microstructure,raindrop size distributions,high rainfall rates,Aerosols,atmospheric humidity,mean temperature,urban tropical location,raindrop sizes,maritime/continental airflow,maritime influence,low rain rates,high rain rate regimes,MODIS,Trajectory,aerosol optical depth,cloud effective radius,Ocean temperature,anthropogenic activities,Rain,changing pattern,Market research,monsoons,land-sea boundary,multiple atmospheric process,relative humidity,aerosols,atmospheric temperature,atmospheric techniques,"

"characterization of the last deglacial transition in tropical east africa: insights from lake albert","2014","New biomarker analyses from Lake Albert, East Africa spanning ~15–9ka show the most extreme, abrupt, multi-stage climate and environmental shifts during the last deglacial transition of anywhere in Africa. Records of hydroclimate expressed in compound specific δD values from terrestrial leaf waxes and a TEX86 paleotemperature record support multiple stages of pronounced drying and cooling from 13.8 to 11.5ka and demonstrate the dynamic behavior of the low latitude tropics during the deglaciation. The vegetation response, illustrated by compound specific δ13C values and fossil pollen records, was an expansion of C4 grassland when the region was cool and arid. These results advance our understanding of a spatially and temporally complex regional response to global climate forcing, suggesting weakening of the Indian Ocean monsoon at the end of the Pleistocene that coincides with a minor decrease in the rate of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) and during a time of stepwise cooling in the northern high latitudes.","TEX paleotemperature,Lake Albert,Sedimentary molecular biomarkers,Deglaciation,Compound specific carbon and hydrogen isotopes,African paleoclimate,"

"location estimation in a maritime environment using a monocular camera","2014","Maritime surveillance is a very important task in coastal areas, especially in harbour environments. The most popular such systems include components like Automatic Identification System (AIS) and Radar. Camera based visual surveillance can be used as an alternative to these systems in order to overcome the lacking features of them. Sea surface object detection and identification is a major need for such visual surveillance systems. Most of the current visual surveillance systems don't have the ability of identifying vessels in real time. A vessel can be identified using information from other systems, if the location of the vessel is identified. Location estimation of sea surface objects is mainly explored in this research. Video stream from a single geo stationary camera is used as the input; however camera properties are not used for any calculation. Mainly two distance measurements are considered and different approaches for estimating the distances are explored. Neural network approach gave considerably accurate results in vertical distance estimation and it was found that the shortest distance from camera to the object can be measured best using B-spline 3D curve fitting. Data taken from AIS is used for fitting curves and training neural network. After calculating distances, latitudes and longitudes are calculated. An evaluation has been done comparing the calculated values and the values obtained from AIS data using various statistical tests. There, the different approaches are compared and accuracy levels are described.

"a novel 3d non-stationary maritime wireless channel model","2022","In this paper, a novel 3-dimensional (3D) non-stationary geometry-based stochastic model (GBSM) is proposed to mimic the ship-to-ship multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication channels.

The model considers the movements of transmitter (Tx), receiver (Rx), and scatterers, and is capable of capturing the channel characteristics, including non-stationary characteristics, spatial consistency, location-dependent property, etc. Through taking the array cluster evolution into account, the proposed channel model can describe massive MIMO channels and can easily switch to conventional MIMO channel model by adjusting corresponding parameters. Based on the proposed model, key statistical properties like delay/angular/Doppler power spectrum density (PSD), space-time correlation function (STCF), stationary interval, and root mean square (RMS) Doppler/delay spreads in multi-scenarios are derived.

"85kr and 133xe monitoring at mri, tsukuba and its importance","2000","Atmospheric 85Kr and 133Xe have continuously been monitored since 1995 (weekly averages) at the Meteorological Research Institute, Tsukuba. Elevated 85Kr concentrations observed in spring and fall of 1995–1997 are the result of two factors, the operation of the PNC Tokai nuclear plant and secondly the seasonal change of prevailing wind directions. Elevated 85Kr levels arising from releases of the Tokai plant are interpreted in a semi-quantitative fashion using the daily 85Kr release data and available meteorological data. During periods without the influence of the Tokai plant, 85Kr background concentrations (1.3Bq/m3 of air) are similar to those for latitudes between 35 and 40°N. Background concentrations show a continuous increase with time and pronounced seasonal variations. The yearly increase rate of about 2.5% observed between 1996 and 1998 is very similar to European observations. The features of the seasonal variations are minimum values during summer and maximum values during winter. 133Xe concentrations are not influenced by major local sources. One observation of a high 133Xe concentration in June 1996 can be interpreted as originating from a Chinese underground nuclear test conducted earlier in the same month.","Noble gas isotopes,Japan,Atmosphere,"
"eloran: resilient positioning, navigation, and timing infrastructure in maritime areas","2020","Global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and localization technology have become highly compact and effective. Although GNSS has been proven to be vulnerable to jamming when the signal strength is weak, most vehicles rely on it for navigation. Compared to GNSS, enhanced Loran (eLoran) is more resistant to jamming and is recommended as a realistic alternative to GNSS. Therefore, South Korea embarked on an eLoran testbed development project to provide resilient navigation information for maritime users. The primary goal of this project was to demonstrate that the system can provide a 20-m position accuracy to the maritime user within a 30-km coverage of a differential Loran station. In this paper, we describe the development of the eLoran testbed implementation and the performance of its preliminary experimental results. To confirm the feasibility of the eLoran testbed performance, we installed an eLoran transmitter and two differential Loran stations and subsequently conducted a zero-baseline performance test at the Pyeongtaek differential Loran station with a new eLoran signal. We also conducted a survey to collect conventional Loran signals along the western and southern coastlines of South Korea.

This work presents a data-driven non-parametric Bayesian model, based on Gaussian Processes, to model normal shipping behaviour. This model is learned from Automatic Identification System (AIS) data and uses an Active Learning paradigm to select an informative subsample of the data to reduce the computational complexity of training. The resultant model allows a measure of normality to be calculated for each newly-observed transmission according to its velocity given its current latitude and longitude. Using this measure of normality, ships can be identified as potentially anomalous and prioritised for further investigation. The model performance is assessed by its ability to detect artificially generated AIS anomalies at locations around the United Kingdom. Finally, the model is demonstrated on case studies from artificial and real vessel data to detect anomalies in unusual tracks.","identification technology,data mining,automatic identification system data,data-driven nonparametric Bayesian model,Bayes methods,Marine vehicles,normal vessel behaviours,unsafe behaviour detection,informative data subsampling,Accuracy,illegal behaviour detection,Bayesian methods,sampling methods,real vessel data,Gaussian process active learning,United Kingdom,Data models,Gaussian processes,artificially generated AIS anomalies detection,maritime anomaly detection,artificial vessel data,training computational complexity,training,Training,behavioural sciences,computational complexity,normal shipping behaviour model,Computational modeling,suspicious behaviour detection,learning (artificial intelligence),newly-observed transmission,AIS data,"
"silicon impacts on soil microflora under ralstonia solanacearum inoculation","2020","Silicon (Si) can increase plant resistance against bacterial wilt caused by Ralstonia solanacearum and enhance plant immune response. However, whether Si alleviates soil-borne disease stress through altering soil microbial community component and diversity is not clear. In this study, effects of Si application under R. solanacearum inoculation with or without plant on soil bacterial and fungal communities were investigated through high-throughput pyrosequencing technique. The results showed that Si addition significantly reduced bacterial wilt incidence. However, Si did not reduce the amount of R. solanacearum in rhizosphere soil. Principal components analysis showed that soil microbial community composition was strongly influenced by Si addition. Total 63.7% bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and 43.8% fungal OTUs were regulated by Si addition regardless of the presence of tomato plants, indicating the independent effects of Si on soil microbial community. Si-added soil harbored a lower abundance of Fusarium, Pseudomonas, and Faecalibacterium. Our finding further demonstrated that exogenous Si could significantly influence soil microbial community component, and this may provide additional insight into the mechanism of Si-enhanced plant resistance against soil-borne pathogens.","bacterial wilt,silicon,soil microbial community,deep pyrosequencing,"
"13.10 glacial responses to climate change","2013","The response of glaciers to atmospheric warming has become a key issue in scientific as well as public and even political discussions about human impacts on the climate system. The predominant tendency of continued worldwide glacier shrinkage may indeed constitute one of the clearest indications in nature of rapid climate change at a global scale. More than a century of systematic and internationally coordinated observations provide quantitative documentation of this development and a basis for model developments in view of possible future scenarios. Mountain ranges at lower latitudes have lost large percentages of their glacier areas and volumes since the end of the Little Ice Age. Many of them may even become largely to even completely de-glaciated already during the coming decades. Such changes have the potential to profoundly affect environmental conditions in and around cold mountain chains. Sea-level rise, changing seasonality in water supply, and local formation of new lakes reflect changes in the water cycle at global, continental, and regional to local scales. They are accompanied by rather marked changes in landscape appearance, slope stability, erosion/sedimentation, and hazard conditions. The monitoring of glaciers itself faces difficult challenges of vanishing glaciers with long-term mass-balance observations. Modern techniques of spatial modeling increasingly help with integrated analysis of observed phenomena and early anticipation of possible developments.","Slope stability,Water cycle,High mountains,Runoff,Continental ice sheets,Sea level,Snow,Climate-system monitoring,Cryosphere,Climate change impacts,Permafrost,Glacier fluctuations,Sea ice,Lakes,Glacier inventories,"
"neural network-based automatic reconstruction of missing vessel trajectory data","2019","Automatic identification system (AIS) is an independent tracking system which has been widely utilized on ships to frequently broadcast the time-stamped vessel position reports. The generated massive AIS data can contribute to protecting maritime security and enhancing maritime transportation efficiency, such as maritime surveillance, anomaly detection and traffic route extraction, etc. However, the received AIS-based vessel trajectories commonly suffer from missing data due to network overload and bad weathers. To improve the quality of vessel trajectories for further researches, a two-step calculation method for vessel trajectory reconstruction is proposed in this work. In particular, the Random Forest method is introduced in the first step to automatically identify the missing position records within vessel trajectories. The missing data points could be accurately estimated from both theoretical and practical perspectives. The second step proposes a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based supervised learning method to reconstruct the vessel trajectories with missing AIS data. The LSTM-based reconstruction method is able to take full advantage of the similar geometrical features behind massive vessel trajectories. Experimental results have confirmed the superior performance of the proposed two-step method in terms of both effectiveness and robustness.","two-step calculation method,surveillance,missing position records,massive AIS data,LSTM-based reconstruction method,random forests,anomaly detection,transportation,Marine vehicles,trajectory reconstruction,maritime security,Random Forest method,long short-term memory-based supervised learning method,network overload,Radio frequency,Decision trees,neural nets,neural network-based automatic reconstruction,vessel trajectory data,ships,automatic identification system,marine safety,marine engineering,maritime surveillance,AIS-based vessel trajectories,trajectory data mining,time-stamped vessel position reports,Logic gates,massive vessel trajectories,Automatic identification system,missing AIS data,Trajectory,traffic route extraction,missing data points,vessel trajectory reconstruction,two-step method,independent tracking system,long short-term memory,maritime transportation efficiency,learning (artificial intelligence),tracking,bad weathers,"
"an early holocene westerly minimum in the southern mid-latitudes","2021","An important coupled ocean-atmospheric system in the mid- and high latitudes involves the Southern Westerly Winds (SWW) and the Southern Ocean (SO), which controls climate in the southernmost third of the world, deep water formation, and ventilation of CO2 from the deep ocean. Most studies have examined its role as a driver of atmospheric CO2 concentrations during glacial terminations, but very few have investigated its influence during the Holocene, i.e. the current interglacial. A fundamental problem, however, is resolving whether the SWW strength increased or declined during the early Holocene (∼11.5–7.5 ka, ka = 1000 cal yr BP) in sectors adjacent to the Drake Passage. Here we assess past changes in SWW influence over the last ∼17,000 years using terrestrial paleoclimate records from southwestern Patagonia (∼52°S). We detect a zonally symmetric Early Holocene Westerly Minimum which diminished wind stress and upwelling on the SO, contributing to a contemporary decline in atmospheric CO2 concentrations and enrichment in the stable carbon isotope ratio of atmospheric CO2 (δ13Catm). Our mid-latitude data also indicate a shift to strong SWW influence at ∼7.5 ka which correlates with a sustained increase in atmospheric CO2 and halt in the δ13Catm rise, suggesting enhancement of high-latitude ocean ventilation by an invigorated SWW-SO coupled system.","Southern middle latitudes,Early holocene westerly minimum,Southern westerly winds,Southwestern patagonia,Atmospheric CO2 holocene,"
"meteorological regimes modulating dust outbreaks in southwest asia: the role of pressure anomaly and inter-tropical convergence zone on the 1–3 july 2014 case","2015","The present work examines the characteristics (source regions, pathways, vertical profiles) as well as the meteorological conditions and the role of the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) during a dust event on 1–3 July 2014 over southwest (SW) Asia. NCEP/NCAR reanalysis, meteorological and satellite remote sensing (MODIS, Meteosat, CALIPSO) observations are utilized. The major dust storm (AOD550 up to 1.5–2.0) was generated in the southern Karakum desert in Turkmenistan as a result of intense north winds (Levar), due to enhanced pressure gradient between the Caspian Sea and Hindu Kush Mountains. The dust storm was vertically extended up to 5km over the arid terrain of SW Asia, as a consequence of the deep mixing layer and increased convection, while over northern Arabian Sea it was mixed with another dust plume coming from Arabia and marine aerosols due to strong monsoon winds within the boundary layer. The regional topography, variations in pressure, monsoon circulation and the position of the ITCZ play a decisive role on modulation of the wind field, dust-storm pathways and vertical distribution of dust. Enhanced knowledge of atmospheric circulation and processes responsible for dust export over SW Asia and Arabian Sea in linkage to the Levar wind and Indian summer monsoon is essential for improving dust forecasts and simulations over the region.","MSLP anomalies,SW Asia,ITCZ position,Dust storm,Karakum desert,Vertical dust distribution,"
"detection of false ais messages for the improvement of maritime situational awareness","2015","The Automatic Identification System (AIS) was initially designed for safety and security of navigation purposes.

"sampling-based path planning for cooperative autonomous maritime vehicles to reduce uncertainty in range-only localization","2019","The following letter presents an adaptive path planning algorithm for cooperative localization in the maritime environment. It considers the scenario where an Autonomous Surface Vehicle (ASV) acts as a Communication and Navigation Aid (CNA) to support Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) with range measurements. As AUVs have no access to GPS while submerged, range measurements can bind the otherwise continuously growing navigational error. This can be done by methods such as range-only Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). In such methods, the resulting uncertainty and positional error depends on the geometry between transmitter (CNA) and receiver (AUV). This letter proposes a planning algorithm that combines priority based expansion of a search tree with random sampling-based exploration to position the CNA at strategic positions to transmit ranging messages at optimal times to reduce the uncertainty and error at the AUVsâ€™ position. The approach is validated and shows an increased confidence for AUVsâ€™ localization in simulated environments as well as real experiments using a dataset gathered from AUV Sirius.","Robot localization,cooperating robots,Path planning,Uncertainty,Autonomous underwater vehicles,Acoustic communication,localization,Navigation,motion and path planning,Motion planning,marine robotics,"

"climate change impacts on tropical cyclones and extreme sea levels in the south pacific — a regional assessment","2012","This paper reviews the current understanding of the effect of climate change on extreme sea levels in the South Pacific region. This region contains many locations that are vulnerable to extreme sea levels in the current climate, and projections indicate that this vulnerability will increase in the future. The recent publication of authoritative statements on the relationship between global warming and global sea level rise, tropical cyclones and the El Niño-Southern Oscillation phenomenon has motivated this review. Confident predictions of global mean sea level rise are modified by regional differences in the steric (density-related) component of sea level rise and changing gravitational interactions between the ocean and the ice sheets which affect the regional distribution of the eustatic (mass-related) contribution to sea level rise. The most extreme sea levels in this region are generated by tropical cyclones. The intensity of the strongest tropical cyclones is likely to increase, but many climate models project a substantial decrease in tropical cyclone numbers in this region, which may lead to an overall decrease in the total number of intense tropical cyclones. This projection, however, needs to be better quantified using improved high-resolution climate model simulations of tropical cyclones. Future changes in ENSO may lead to large regional variations in tropical cyclone incidence and sea level rise, but these impacts are also not well constrained. While storm surges from tropical cyclones give the largest sea level extremes in the parts of this region where they occur, other more frequent high sea level events can arise from swell generated by distant storms. Changes in wave climate are projected for the tropical Pacific due to anthropogenically-forced changes in atmospheric circulation. Future changes in sea level extremes will be caused by a combination of changes in mean sea level, regional sea level trends, tropical cyclone incidence and wave climate. Recommendations are given for research to increase understanding of the response of these factors to climate change. Implications of the results for adaptation research are also discussed.","sea level,ENSO,tropical cyclones,South Pacific,Climate change,"

It can also classify and recognize sea surface targets through high-resolution ship target information provided by inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR), grasp the situation of sea surface targets and deal with dangers when necessary, and response to dangerous sea targets. Therefore, the research of airborne ISAR ship target imaging is very important. Firstly, the working principle of airborne ISAR system is summarized, and the key problems faced by airborne ISAR system are analyzed.

"improving maritime traffic emission estimations on missing data with crbms","2020","Maritime traffic emissions are a major concern to governments as they heavily impact the Air Quality in coastal cities. Ships use the Automatic Identification System (AIS) to continuously report position and speed among other features, and therefore this data is suitable to be used to estimate emissions, if it is combined with engine data. However, important ship features are often inaccurate or missing. State-of-the-art complex systems, like CALIOPE at the Barcelona Supercomputing Center, are used to model Air Quality. These systems can benefit from AIS based emission models as they are very precise in positioning the pollution. Unfortunately, these models are sensitive to missing or corrupted data, and therefore they need data curation techniques to significantly improve the estimation accuracy. In this work, we propose a methodology for treating ship data using Conditional Restricted Boltzmann Machines (CRBMs) plus machine learning methods to improve the quality of data passed to emission models that can also be applied to other GPS and time-series problems. Results show that we can improve the default methods proposed to cover missing data. In our results, we observed that using our method the models boosted their accuracy to detect otherwise undetectable emissions. In particular, we used a real data-set of AIS data, provided by the Spanish Port Authority, to estimate that thanks to our method, the model was able to detect 45% of additional emissions, representing 152 tonnes of pollutants per week in Barcelona and propose new features that may enhance emission modeling.","CRBM,Data cleaning,Emission modeling,AIS,GPS,Ship time series,"

The proposed method decides for each trajectory point if the vessel is anomalous, considering longitude, latitude, speed and direction. Although the approach is point-based, which is applicable for real-time AIS surveillance, it is also flexible enough for analysts to set their own threshold for labeling whole trajectories.","naval engineering computing,navigational behaviors,Clustering algorithms,vessel movements,distance measurement,anomaly detection,Marine vehicles,specialized distance measures,traffic separation scheme boundaries,Gravity,ship movement anomaly detection,ships,automatic identification system,real-time systems,maritime surveillance,Data models,international maritime organization rules,pattern clustering,trajectory mining,vessels,Trajectory,clustering,Labeling,real-time AIS surveillance,Data mining,maritime traffic domain,"
"applications of machine learning methods in port operations – a systematic literature review","2022","Ports are pivotal nodes in supply chain and transportation networks, in which most of the existing data remain underutilized. Machine learning methods are versatile tools to utilize and harness the hidden power of the data.

To fill the gap, we aimed to provide a comprehensive systematic literature review on this topic to analyze the previous research from different perspectives such as area of the application, type of application, machine learning method, data, and location of the study. Results showed that the number of articles in the field has been increasing annually, and the most prevalent use case of machine learning methods is to predict different port characteristics.

"a biogeochemical orientation survey in the moisan gold-mineralized area, haenam district in korea","2011","A biogeochemical orientation survey was carried out in the vicinity of an epithermal Au deposit in the Moisan Au–Ag mineralized area, Haenam district in Korea. The Au–Ag bearing quartz veins of the mine occur as narrow open-space fillings within Cretaceous silicic pyroclastics. The vein minerals consist mainly of quartz, sericite, pyrite, chalcopyrite, and galena, with some electrum and argentite. The main objectives of this study were to study the geochemical characteristics of rocks, soils and plants in this area, to investigate the spatial relationship between Au and associated elements in rock–soil–plant system, and to evaluate the applicability of biogeochemical prospecting for Au vein occurrences in Korea. Samples of rocks and soils, and leaves of three plant species (Japanese red pine — P. densiflora, oriental white oak — Q. aliena, Japanese mallotus — M. japonicus) were collected from the target mineralized area and control barren locations, and analyzed for trace elements by instrumental neutron activation analysis. Sampling lines were composed of one slope line which is almost parallel to the mineralized quartz-veins, and four transect lines spaced 100m apart across the veins at 20m sampling intervals. From the multi-element data of rock samples (n=9), high values of Au (maximum 2030ppb) are spatially related to Au–quartz veins. Soil samples (n=61) collected from five sampling lines show higher values of Au (24–825ppb) whereas soil samples from the control locations have lower values of Au (below 25ppb). Many plant species collected from the vicinity of the veins have high Au contents compared with those at the control locations, but the ranges of Au values are variable among plant species. In a total of 128 samples of plant leaves, Q. aliena yielded Au values of 0.4 to 6.9ppb, and M. japonicus 0.9 to 4.1ppb. Gold contents in P. densiflora ranged from 0.1 to 5.6ppb. Plant leaves from control areas show less than 1.6ppb Au. The biological absorption coefficient (BAC) of Au in plants decreases in the order of Q. aliena>M. japonicus>P. densiflora. Based on the results of the study, Q. aliena appeared to be the best sampling media for biogeochemical prospecting of Au in the study area.","Au anomaly,Biogeochemical survey,Gold–quartz veins,"
"wavelet-based despeckling for onboard image processing in a small satellite sar maritime surveillance constellation","2012","New developments in small spacecraft capabilities will soon enable formation-flying constellations of small satellites, capable of performing remote sensing missions at low cost.

Two or more small microsatellites will follow a large synthetic aperture radar (SAR) transmitter, each carrying a SAR receiver antenna and one carrying an automatic identification system (AIS) antenna. Voluntary broadcasts of vessel position and velocity via AIS are received and decoded, and compared with SAR observations to verify the data and identify potentially non-cooperative vessels. Limited transmit power and downlink time will dictate that data be processed onboard the spacecraft.

"a multivariate logic decision support system for optimization of the maritime routes","2017","In recent years, maritime freight transportation and the consequent handling of containers are among the most dynamic and growing sectors. The aim of this research is to propose a Decision Support System (DSS) addressed mainly to shipping companies, allowing the choice, even en-route, of the hub port of destination for the successive multi-modal operations. The companies make choices in relation both to the ship location and to a dynamic accessibility indicator. The accessibility indicator is generally accepted as the parameter that better represents the interactions between a port and its hinterland. Different factors can influence the accessibility in maritime transport; some of them are characterized by low variability, while others show a high within-day dynamics. For example, the technical characteristics of ports (number of berths and their depths, number of cranes, storage area, etc.) belong to the first group; instead, the number of free berths, the delay time in freight loading and unloading operations, and weather conditions can change during the day. Their variability can be evaluated by a real-time monitoring, while the ship location can be easily obtained by GPS and radar signals. In the proposed DSS, we have considered data about the technical characteristics of ports and, depending on the request coming from ships, acquires the dynamic characteristics of each port, the ship location and the destination area. After the completion of the process, the DSS provides as output the port â€œcloserâ€ to the requests expressed by the users. Since some current values of both the dynamic characteristics of ports and information provided by shipping companies are subject to uncertainty, we proposed a DSS based on a multivariate accessibility indicator.","decision support systems,accessibility indicator,unloading operations,dynamic accessibility indicator,Transportation,dynamic characteristics,Ports (Computers),freight loading,transportation,Marine vehicles,Companies,goods distribution,radar signals,decision support system,ship location,multivariate logic decision support system,growing sectors,marine systems,shipping companies,maritime transportation,maritime transport,freight containers,Data models,maritime freight transportation,containers,Real-time systems,GPS,Decision support systems,multimodal operations,DSS,optimization,maritime routes,dynamic sectors,real-time monitoring,production engineering computing,"
"chapter 56 - tin","2015","Inorganic tin compounds occur naturally in the Earth’s crust. In the environment, tin can be found in both inorganic and organic forms. Inorganic tin compounds are released from natural and anthropogenic sources. The conversion of metallic tin forms to compounds that may be more soluble increases the risk of exposure and toxicity. Organotin compounds in the environment largely originate from anthropogenic activities. However, chemical and biochemical methylation reactions convert inorganic tin compounds into methyltin form. Biomethylation of alkyltins results in the accumulation of more toxic organotin compounds. Tin is not regarded an essential nutrient for humans. However, tin is considered an essential for the growth of rats, with a requirement for tin of between 1 and 2mg/kg in the diet. Elemental tin, inorganic tin compounds, and long-chain alkyltins are poorly absorbed when ingested, which accounts for their relatively low toxicity. The toxicity of organotin compounds depends on the length of alkyl chain, hydrophobicity, and other physicochemical properties. Hydrophobic organotins are toxic to a wide variety of organisms owing to their high solubility in cell membranes. The alkyl tins are more toxic than the aryl tins, whereas the toxicity of short-chain alkyltin compounds such as trimethyl- and triethyltin is higher than that of long-chain compounds: toxicity increases with number of alkyl groups. The excretory routes of tin compounds may vary depending of the type of compounds and the mode of exposure. Insoluble inorganic tin compounds are largely nontoxic. However, inhalation of tin dust results in its deposition in lungs and may cause “stannosis,” a benign pneumoconiosis. Some tin salts are irritating or can liberate toxic fumes during decomposition. Gastrointestinal absorption of soluble tin salts is only a few percent of the ingested dose. In chronic exposure, tin tends to accumulate in kidney, liver, and bones. Bones comprise a major site of deposition of tin after long-term exposure and intramuscular injection. The biological half-life of tin in bone is approximately 100 days. Exposure to high concentrations of inorganic tin may cause gastrointestinal illness, as well as liver and kidney problems. No noteworthy histopathological observations of nonneoplastic nature were reported in a long-term study. Short-chain alkyls are easily absorbed from gastrointestinal tract. Some alkyltin compounds, particularly tributyltin and triphenyltin, have high toxicity. Chronic exposure to butyltin compounds causes imposex, a pathological condition characterized by development of male sex characteristics in female gastropods. Toxicity of organotins in humans is most frequently reported as loss of memory and seizure, as well as other symptoms including death. Short-chain alkyltin, particularly the trialkyl derivatives, and aromatic tin compounds are neurotoxic. Hydrophobic trimethyltin and triethyltin compounds readily diffuse into richly lipophilic tissues such as brain and cause encephalopathy, cerebral edema, and severe seizures. Tetraalkyltins are enzymatically converted to the trisubstituted form and exert delayed but similar neurotoxic effects. Tributyltin compounds are less toxic than trimethyl- and triethyltins. They may be strongly irritating to the skin in humans. It was reported that shipyard workers exposed to tributyltin oxide developed severe dermatitis, difficulty in breathing, and flu-like symptoms. Trisubstituted organotin derivatives are implicated in hepatotoxicity, immunodeficiency, endocrine disruption, and both reproductive anomalies and infertility in laboratory animals. Monobutyltin and dibutyltin show genotoxicity, while mono- and dimethyltin are not genotoxic. Organotin compounds penetrate the cell membrane and interrupt oxidative phosphorylation, disturb calcium homeostasis, damage mitochondria, and induce apoptosis.","biocompatibility,detection methods,mechanism of toxicity,metabolism,organotins,risk assessment,tin,environment,"

"anthropogenic emissions and space-borne observations of carbon monoxide over south asia","2016","The focus of this study is to understand anthropogenic emissions, spatiotemporal variability and trends of carbon monoxide (CO) over South Asia by using datasets from MACCity (Monitoring Atmospheric Composition and Climate, MACC and megaCITY – Zoom for the Environment, CityZEN), REAS (Regional Emission inventory in Asia), AIRS (Atmospheric Infrared Sounder) and SCIAMACHY (SCanning Imaging Absorption spectroMeter for Atmospheric CartograpHY). MACCity anthropogenic emissions show an overall increase of 16.5% during 2000–2010. Elevated levels of MACCity CO are found in Indo-Gangetic Basin (IGB), eastern mining region of India, Bangladesh and large urban areas. Some of the major contributors of these emissions have been identified as agricultural waste burning, land transport, industrial production, and energy generation and distribution. An area averaged mean value of AIRS CO at 600hPa is found to be 114±2ppbv (slope −0.48±0.2ppbvyr−1, y-intercept 117±1ppbv and r=0.68) with a minor declining trend at −0.41±0.18%yr−1 over the region during 2003–2015. A strong seasonality in AIRS CO concentration is observed with spring season peak in March 129±1.9ppbv, whereas low values have been observed in summer monsoon with sturdy dip in July 99.6±1.94ppbv.

"modeling and application of global maritime transport accessibility based on probability distribution","2023","The study of sea area accessibility is often overlooked despite the fact that vessel routesâ€™ density at sea can reflect human activity patterns.

An accessibility model for sea areas was then proposed and applied to the grid, resulting in the accessibility assessment of global sea areas in 2014 and 2018. The results indicated that the average global maritime accessibility value increased from 5.2% in 2014 to 14.4% in 2018. Accessibility to various international trade routes, such as those through the Cape of Good Hope and polar regions, significantly increased.

"modelling dynamic maritime traffic complexity with radial distribution functions","2021","The identification of maritime traffic complexity is important to guide maritime surveillance operators towards the more critical areas for the real-time monitoring of the maritime traffic situation. To identify and map the traffic complexity effectively, this paper proposes a dynamic maritime traffic complexity model based on radial distribution functions. For modelling the traffic complexity, three sub complexity models are established first by addressing the speed, course and position of the ships. For each sub-model, the main variable is used for building the radial distribution function model, and a variation method is used to estimate the complexity. Finally, the overall traffic complexity can be identified and mapped by synthesizing the results from the three sub-models. The AIS data in the northern Yellow Sea of China is used for validating the proposed model. The results show that the proposed model can effectively identify the traffic complexity in the studied sea area, and have an advantage in some special sea area compared with the previous traffic complexity model. By applying the proposed model, maritime surveillance operators can better monitor the real-time traffic situation and improve their working efficiency, which are crucial for the improvement of navigational safety.","AIS data,Navigational safety,Maritime traffic complexity,Radial distribution function,"
"analyzing congestion interdependencies of ports and container ship routes in the maritime network infrastructure","2018","Events, such as prolonged congestion in ports or unavailable ship routes in the maritime network, often initiate cascading congestions that block transportation and/or disrupt services over wide areas. Existing traffic flow analysis methods lack the ability to understand the cascading effects of delays in ship routes or how to reduce overall delays in greater maritime areas. Dependency risk graphs have been proposed as a tool for analyzing such cascading events using dependency chains. This paper proposes a risk-based interdependency analysis method capable to detect large-scale traffic congestions between interconnected ports and ship routes in the maritime network and provide solutions to improve flow. Presented dependency risk chains of ports along with graph theory help us analyze ship routes and detect ports that are affected most when other major ports are congested in the maritime network, detect the causes of bottlenecks, and provide valuable info in relieving delays across container ship routes. We apply the proposed method on historical container ship routing data provided by the MarineTraffic company that maintains a comprehensive maritime database worldwide for more than six million users monthly. This application-oriented, interdisciplinary effort culminated in a prototype tool is able to analyze the historical data for container ships in the entire global maritime network and detect congestion dependencies. The tool can be used to identify key shipping routes or ports that: 1) are prone to delays; 2) greatly affect the overall maritime network due to position, connections and risk of congestion; and/or 3) get affected the most by delays in previous route legs.","maritime database worldwide,cascading effects,Transportation,telecommunication network routing,graph,congestion interdependency analysis,centrality,vehicle routing,interconnected ports,transportation,Marine vehicles,sector,Delays,Mathematical model,Maritime,infrastructure,cascading,delay,Containers,ships,dependency risk chains,container,risk-based interdependency analysis method,dependency,flow,congestion,MarineTraffic company,impact,global maritime network infrastructure,sea ports,historical container ship routing data,containers,traffic flow analysis methods,graph theory,large-scale traffic congestion detection,risk,marine communication,Tools,route,Analytical models,port,"
"reconstructing two millennia of copper and silver metallurgy in the lake titicaca region (bolivia/peru) using trace metals and lead isotopic composition","2021","Copper, silver, and gold exploitation has been a foundation of economic and socio-cultural development of Andean societies, at least for the last three millennia. The main centers of pre-colonial metallurgy are well-known from archeological artifacts, but temporal gaps inherent in this record handicap a finer understanding of the modalities of ore exploitation by succeeding civilizations. A continuous record over time of trace metals emitted during ore smelting operations make lake sediments excellent candidates to fill those gaps. Two millennia of metallurgy were reconstructed from atmospherically derived metals together with lead (Pb) isotope ratios in two dated sediment cores from Lake Titicaca. The first evidence for metallurgy is found during the apogee of the Tiwanaku state (AD 800–1150), with a higher copper (Cu) accumulation that can be attributed to the smelting of local Cu ores, based on Pb isotopic fingerprinting. During the Late Intermediate Period (AD 1150–1450), recorded peaks in metal deposition that persisted for ∼ twenty years show that mining activities were intensive but discontinuous. Pb isotope ratios suggest diversified extractive activities, mainly located in the southern part of the central Altiplano. Finally, the most intense mining epoch began during the Inca Empire (ca. AD 1500) and lasted until the end of the Colonial Period (AD 1830), with unprecedented metal deposition over this interval. Pb isotope fingerprinting shows that mining operations occurred mainly in the Lake Titicaca and Potosi areas and were responsible for metal emissions recorded in the entire Altiplano, as evidenced by other studies.","Copper,Central Andes mining,Lake Titicaca sediment,Lead isotopes,Silver,"
"a merchant ship thermo-salinograph network in the pacific ocean","1996","The need for better knowledge of sea surface salinity (SSS) and sea surface temperature (SST) distribution in the tropical oceans was brought to light during the 10 years of the TOGA programme (1985–1994). In order to improve on the original “meteorological bucket” method of sampling, we developed a network of merchant ships among those operating regular routes through the tropical Pacific, and equipped them with thermo-salinographs. Accurate positioning of the ships was obtained using a satellite positioning system. High frequency sampling (every 15 s) and recording of the median values for every 5 min resulted in quite precise monitoring of the SST and SSS, and in a description of the salinity fronts along the routes followed by the ships. Using this equipment, we were able to detect the influence of local rainfall on salinity and temperature and the diurnal cycle of sea surface temperature. The accuracy of salinity measurements (0.02) was better than that of the old sampling technique by one order of magnitude. Temperature measurement by the thermo-salinograph was very stable but yielded results that are 0.2–0.3°C higher than sea surface temperature. To ensure reliability of data, the equipment was carefully checked every time the ships called at Noumea (i.e. every 2–3 months), and re-calibration every year or two is essential.",""
"tracing illegal oil discharges from vessels using sar and ais in bohai sea of china","2021","In China's 14th Five-Year Plan, it is necessary to coordinate the promotion of marine ecological protection and prevent environmental risks such as marine oil spills. The illegal discharge of oily waste from ships is an important source of oil spill pollution in the Bohai Sea, and has become an important factor hindering the purification of the marine environment. Because SAR remote sensing is not restricted by light conditions, it can work at night, in heavy fog, overcast and rainy days, and has become one of the important techniques for monitoring oil spills on the sea. AIS can provide real-time and historical position and track information of ships. The combination of SAR and AIS can provide a great help for maritime regulatory authorities to find the source of oil spill pollution. However, China has not yet established a mature and effective oil spill supervision system based on SAR and AIS. This paper proposes a framework for oil spill detection and accountability using the combination of SAR, AIS and boarding inspection, and takes an example of the monitoring and tracking process of illegal oil discharge from a ship in the Bohai Sea. As far as we know, this is the first time that China has used SAR and AIS to identify ships that illegally discharge oily sewage. This work framework can provide a reference for China's maritime agencies to improve the oil spill supervision system during the 14th Five-Year Plan.","Synthetic aperture radar,Illegal discharge,Automatic identification system,Oil spill,"
"detecting maneuvers in maritime observation data with cusum","2017","Understanding and building suitable marine traffic and prediction models is a difficult undertaking. To build such a model, it is necessary to understand vessels behavior and have knowledge about the driving patterns. In general, a complex dynamic model for several ship types is used. Maritime sensors like AIS or radar do not always provide the necessary information, like vessel size or type. That is why a simpler solution for detecting maneuvers in maritime observation data is needed. We present a light approach to detect maneuver in maritime observation data without information about the vessel dynamic. For the maneuver detection, we use the CUSUM method which is normally be used in change point detection and use it for geospatial data. Further we present our data fusion process for AIS and radar fusion, both provided from the LABSKAUS infrastructure, to get a better situation picture.","maneuver detection,vessel dynamic,sensor fusion,maritime sensors,data fusion process,data visualisation,CUSUM,maritime observation data,marine systems,LABSKAUS infrastructure,oceanographic equipment,automatic identification system,ships,change point detection,radar,Data models,vessel size,Artificial intelligence,geographic information systems,Radar,suitable marine traffic,Data integration,complex dynamic model,Sensors,Navigation,prediction models,geospatial data,radar fusion,vessels behavior,remote sensing by radar,Dynamics,"
"traffic pattern detection using the hough transformation for anomaly detection to improve maritime domain awareness","2014","Techniques for extracting traffic patterns from ship position data to generate atlases of expected ocean travel are developed in this paper. An archive of historical data is used to develop a traffic density grid. The Hough transformation is used to extract linear patterns of elevated density from the traffic density grid, which can be considered the â€œhighwaysâ€ of the oceans. These highways collectively create an atlas that is used to define geographical regions of expected ship locations. The atlas generation techniques are demonstrated using automated information system (AIS) ship position data to detect highways in both open-ocean and coastal areas. Additionally, the atlas generation techniques are used to explore variability in ship traffic as a result of extreme weather. The development of an automatic atlas generation technique that can be used to develop a definition of normal maritime behavior is a significant result of this research.","Traffic control,historical data archive,highway detection,Pattern Extraction,geographical regions,automatic atlas generation technique,cartography,anomaly detection,Marine vehicles,maritime domain awareness,traffic density grid,geography,AIS ship position data,Meteorology,Hough transformation,normal maritime behavior,ships,Maritime Domain Awareness,marine engineering,Hough Transformation,Hough transforms,Oceans,traffic information systems,traffic pattern extraction,coastal area,automated information system ship position data,linear pattern extraction,traffic pattern detection,Road transportation,Market research,ship traffic,image processing,Data mining,ocean travel,open-ocean area,Automated Information System,"
"two-stage offloading optimization for energyâ€“latency tradeoff with mobile edge computing in maritime internet of things","2020","The ever-increasing growth in maritime activities with large amounts of Maritime Internet-of-Things (M-IoT) devices and the exploration of ocean network leads to a great challenge for dealing with a massive amount of maritime data in a cost-effective and energy-efficient way. However, the resources-constrained maritime users cannot meet the high requirements of transmission delay and energy consumption, due to the excessive traffic and limited resources in maritime networks. To solve this problem, mobile edge computing is taken as a promising paradigm to help mobile devices from edge servers via computation offloading considering the different quality of service (QoS) with the complex ocean environments, resulting in energy saving and increased transmission latency. To investigate the tradeoff between latency and energy consumption in low-cost large-scale maritime communication, we formulate the offloading optimization problem and propose a two-stage joint optimal offloading algorithm, optimizing computation and communication resource allocation under limited energy and sensitive latency. At the first stage, the maritime users make the decision on whether to offload a computation considering their demands and environments. Then, the channel allocation and power allocation problems were proposed to optimize the offloading policy which coordinates with the center cloud servers at the second stage, considering the dynamic tradeoff of latency and energy consumption. Finally, numerical simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.","offloading strategies,telecommunication power management,channel allocation,computation offloading,maritime data,limited resources,ocean network,dynamic tradeoff,two-stage joint optimal offloading algorithm,energy-efficiency,resources-constrained maritime users,QoS,Internet of Things,quality of service,Marine vehicles,Maritime Internet-of-Things,Resource management,large-scale maritime communication,mobile edge computing (MEC),two-stage offloading optimization,Servers,Energy???latency tradeoff,cloud computing,maritime networks,Oceans,optimisation,communication resource allocation,mobile computing,mobile edge computing,energy-latency tradeoff,offloading policy,maritime Internet of Things (M-IoT),network traffic,energy saving,transmission delay,telecommunication traffic,complex ocean environments,energy consumption,mobile devices,Cloud computing,marine communication,power allocation problems,cloud server,offloading optimization problem,Task analysis,maritime activities,resource allocation,edge servers,M-IoT devices,"

"event-triggered cooperative formation control for autonomous surface vehicles under the maritime search operation","2022","To improve the autonomy of maritime search and rescue (SAR) operation, this paper concentrates on the formation control problem for autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) with the limited communication resource. A novel parallel search guidance, considering the maneuvering characteristics of ASVs, is developed to guide the formation to execute the automatic SAR operation. That can guarantee that the corresponding guidance law is highly efficient, self-driving and suitable for the large-scale formation. Combined with the guidance principle, a formation control algorithm is proposed by fuse of the event-triggered control and neural networks (NNs). In the proposed scheme, the gain uncertainty of actuators is effectively compensated requiring no prior information around the model structure. Unlike the existing results, the proposed event-triggered mechanism can activate synchronously both the controller and the NNs weight estimator.

"noma-based uav communications for maritime coverage enhancement","2021","The lack of communication infrastructure in the ocean inevitably leads to coverage blind zones. In addition to high-throughput marine satellites, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be used to provide coverage for these blind zones along with onshore base stations. In this paper, we consider the use of UAV for maritime coverage enhancement. Particularly, to serve more ships on the vast oceanic area with limited spectrum resources, we employ non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). A joint power and transmission duration allocation problem is formulated to maximize the minimum ship throughput, with the constraints on onboard communication energy. Different from previous works, we only assume the slowly time-varying large-scale channel state information (CSI) to reduce the system cost, as the large-scale CSI is location-dependent and can be obtained according to a priori radio map. To solve the non-convex problem, we decompose it into two subproblems and solve them in an iterative way.

"smart infrastructure technologies: crowdsourcing future development and benefits for australian communities","2020","Smart Information and Communications Technology (ICT) is envisaged to provide the capabilities to plan, design, construct, operate and manage Australia's key infrastructure. With over 75% of Australia's population living in cities and accessing public and private goods and services, ICT is positioned as a strategic resource for smart infrastructure developments. In this study, international and domestic stakeholder inputs on the future role of smart ICT in advancing Australia's infrastructure development and operations were crowdsourced for analysis. The study identifies several forms of smart ICT (e.g. building information modelling software) enabled infrastructure that possesses potential to deliver over A$9 billion per annum in domestic economic improvements, with commensurate advancement of communities, regions and urban environments. However, to be effective these smart ICT require enablement through open and interoperable data, sound governance and policy, and government leadership and coordination using dedicated resources.

"simple approach to study biomolecule adsorption in polymeric microfluidic channels","2013","Herein a simple analytical method is presented for the characterization of biomolecule adsorption on cyclo olefin polymer (COP, trade name: Zeonor®) substrates which are widely used in microfluidic lab-on-a-chip devices. These Zeonor® substrates do not possess native functional groups for specific reactions with biomolecules. Therefore, depending on the application, such substrates must be functionalized by surface chemistry methods to either enhance or suppress biomolecular adsorption. This work demonstrates a microfluidic method for evaluating the adsorption of antibodies and oligonucleotides surfaces. The method uses centrifugal microfluidic flow-through chips and can easily be implemented using common equipment such as a spin coater. The working principle is very simple. The user adds 40L of the solution containing the sample to the starting side of a microfluidic channel, where it is moved through by centrifugal force. Some molecules are adsorbed in the channel. The sample is then collected at the other end in a small reservoir and the biomolecule concentration is measured. As a pilot application, we characterized the adsorption of goat anti-human IgG and a 20-mer DNA on Zeonor®, and on three types of functionalized Zeonor: 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) modified surface with mainly positive charge, negatively charged surface with immobilized bovine serum albumin (BSA), and neutral, hydrogel-like film with polyethylene glycol (PEG) characteristics. This simple analytical approach adds to the fundamental understanding of the interaction forces in real, microfluidic systems. This method provides a straightforward and rapid way to screen surface compositions and chemistry, and relate these to their effects on the sensitivity and resistance to non-specific binding of bioassays using them. In an additional set of experiments, the surface area of the channels in this universal microfluidic chip was increased by precision milling of microscale trenches. This modified surface was then coated with APTES and tested for its potential to serve as a unique protein dilution feature.","Zeonor,Antibody adsorption,DNA adsorption,Polymer substrates,Microfluidics,"

The approaches of the leadership behavior, context of the environment, technical and social skills, characteristics, risks of human errors, and respective analysis of decisions making are discussed case by case. High prominence is given in the approaches and results of leadership and of team procedures under the different situations of human reliability analysis, referring to shared experiences that can intervene positively or negatively on the company's results, both in the routine activities or in emergency situations. Listening and analyzing the operator's discourse as a link for the exchange of knowledge and commitment are essential in this text. Also, possible human errors at the levels of management, execution, strategic, and emergency are discussed, including the impacts generated by non-assertive decisions. In each case, learning points can be observed for composition of diagnoses and training, including concerns related to human and sociotechnical reliability. These points are derived from practical factory floor experiences, which include production, maintenance, technology, management, and research activities. Discussions are presented of the cases investigated and demanded by society and transformed into articles or services, dealing with cognitive academy, archetype, executive function, and operator’s discourse to the chemical industry, guilt culture, operational control, and just culture. The investigations contained in the articles present validation of the guidelines and reaffirm tools.

"developments in controlled green-water larval culture technologies for estuarine fishes in queensland, australia and elsewhere","2007","Since 1989, researchers with the Department of Primary Industries and Fisheries (DPI&F) in Queensland, Australia, have successfully used controlled low-water exchange green-water cultures to rear the larvae of estuarine fishes and crustaceans through to metamorphosis. High survivals and excellent fry condition have been achieved for several commercially important endemic species produced for various projects. They include barramundi or sea bass, Lates calcarifer, Australian bass, Macquaria novemaculeata, dusky flathead, Platycephalus fuscus, sand whiting, Sillago ciliata, red sea bream or snapper, Pagrus auratus, banana prawn, Fenneropenaeus merguiensis, and others. The consistent success of our standardised and relatively simple approach at different localities has led to it being incorporated into general fingerling production practices at several establishments in Australia. Although post-metamorphosis rearing methods have differed for each species investigated, due to various biological and behavioural traits and project requirements, these larval rearing methods have been successful with few species-specific modifications. Initially modelled on the Taiwanese approach to rearing Penaeids in aerated low-water exchange cultures, the approach similarly appears to rely on a beneficial assemblage of micro-organisms. Conceptually, these micro-organisms may include a mixture of the air-borne primary invaders of pure phytoplankton cultures when exposed to outdoor conditions. Whilst this would vary with different sites, our experiences with these methods have consistently been favourable. Mass microalgal cultures with eco-physiological youth are used to regularly augment larval fish cultures so that rearing conditions simulate an exponential growth-phase microalgal bloom. Moderate to heavy aeration prevents settlement of particulate matter and encourages aerobic bacterial decomposition of wastes. The green-water larval rearing approach described herein has demonstrated high practical utility in research and commercial applications, and has greatly simplified marine finfish hatchery operations whilst generally lifting production capacities for metamorphosed fry in Australia. Its potential uses in areas of aquaculture other than larviculture are also discussed.","Shrimp,Green water,Fish,Larviculture,Mesocosm,"

Many symbolic major events have celebrated these developments, e.g., in Venice, Italy, the 15th (2006) and 20th (2012) years of progress and more recently, in 2018, in Ponta Delgada, Portugal, 25 Years of Progress in Radar Altimetry. On this latter occasion it was decided to collect contributions of scientists, engineers and managers involved in the worldwide altimetry community to depict the state of altimetry and propose recommendations for the altimetry of the future. This paper summarizes contributions and recommendations that were collected and provides guidance for future mission design, research activities, and sustainable operational radar altimetry data exploitation. Recommendations provided are fundamental for optimizing further scientific and operational advances of oceanographic observations by altimetry, including requirements for spatial and temporal resolution of altimetric measurements, their accuracy and continuity. There are also new challenges and new openings mentioned in the paper that are particularly crucial for observations at higher latitudes, for coastal oceanography, for cryospheric studies and for hydrology. The paper starts with a general introduction followed by a section on Earth System Science including Ocean Dynamics, Sea Level, the Coastal Ocean, Hydrology, the Cryosphere and Polar Oceans and the “Green” Ocean, extending the frontier from biogeochemistry to marine ecology. Applications are described in a subsequent section, which covers Operational Oceanography, Weather, Hurricane Wave and Wind Forecasting, Climate projection. Instruments’ development and satellite missions’ evolutions are described in a fourth section.

"structural health monitoring of harbor caissons using support vector machine and principal component analysis","2021","Harbor caissons are regarded as one of the most critical infrastructures, and any disruption in their operation would have dramatic economic consequences. The need for a health monitoring system for these structures is thus evident. The primary aim of this study is to develop a structural health monitoring (SHM) system to effectively detect damage in harbor caissons. To this end, through performing dynamic analysis, acceleration signals are extracted from the locations in the model corresponding to the presumed accelerometer's placement in an actual structure. Three levels of white Gaussian noises are added to the original signal to simulate the ambient noise. Using the acquired signals, the damage-sensitive features in both frequency and time domains are determined in the structure. In this study, leveraging Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Support Vector Machine (SVM), the damage-sensitive features associated with the damaged and undamaged structure are reduced in dimensionality and classified. Hence, the introduced system can assess the state of the structure based on the input signal from the accelerometer and detect possible damage and its severity. The effectiveness of the proposed system in detecting damage is shown using the numerical model of a real harbor caisson.","Support vector machine (SVM),Principal component analysis (PCA),Finite element (FE) modeling,Structural health monitoring,Autoregressive (AR) model,Machine learning,Harbor caissons,"

"meteorological analysis of chemical exchange events in the arctic basin","1995","Analysis of chemical or aerosol exchange from the troposphere to the arctic surface is considerably more complex than similar analysis of Antarctic events. The complexity of chemical or aerosol exchange experiments in the Arctic requires considering occasional frontal exchange similar to that of the mid-latitudes, potential local contamination, and local sources of heat and moisture. These concerns are eliminated through site selection in most Antarctic exchange experiments. The inherent stability of near-surface layers in the arctic tropopause causes temporal anomalies when arrival times of aerosol or gaseous contaminants are compared with conservative meteorological tracers, further complicating the analysis. Three cases are presented. One illustrates the complexity in analyzing aerosol related to a warming event, the second describes the dimensions of a deep tropospheric mixing in the Arctic Basin, and the third examines the diurnal exchange of aerosol in the arctic summer. Some criteria relative to temporal resolution of aerosol and chemical measurements with respect to meteorological processes are proposed. Potential problems in distinguishing properties of aerosols transported from lower latitudes, in the presence of local aerosol sources, are discussed.","Arctic meteorology,Arctic chemical exchange,Arctic ozone exchange,Arctic aerosol exchange,Carbon dioxide-water vapour,Arctic basin,"
"recent increase in no2 levels in the southeast of the iberian peninsula","2019","We report the evolution of tropospheric NO2 over the south-east of the Iberian Peninsula from 2005 to 2017. We have used hourly NO2 levels measured at air-quality stations in urban and suburban environments. Annual averages ranged between 14 and 45 μg m−3, with peaks above 200 μg m−3. A monthly variation was observed, with higher concentrations in cold months (40–60 μg m−3) and lower levels in the warm season (13–17 μg m−3). A diurnal pattern was found in urban and suburban areas. The upward trend in NO2 observed during the whole period contrasts with the upward trend reported in 2013–2017. The NO2 tropospheric column levels measured by the Ozone Monitoring Instrument over the Iberian Peninsula indicated a similar behaviour; nevertheless, the largest Spanish metropolitan areas did not show this increase. The mean sea level pressure and wind field data of ERA5 (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts) were used to investigate the weather conditions, the NO2 outputs of the Copernicus Monitoring Services being used for the assessment of the NO2 spatial distribution. NO2 regional events, with concentrations in the range 140–150 μg m−3, and which occurred both in the winter and summer season under anticyclonic conditions, are also described. A local origin is identified in winter, whereas in summer, they are associated with a high-pressure system that blocks Mediterranean outflows towards the Atlantic Ocean. The high NO2 levels are attributed mainly to two factors: i) local emissions, rather than contributions from the western Mediterranean (or even North Africa), and ii) an increase in the pressure gradient between the Atlantic and the Mediterranean pressure systems, associated with a decrease in wind speed, was found during the last five years compared with the previous eight. Meteorological and chemical changes in mid-latitudes associated with global warming should also be investigated in the future.","NO trends,Nitrogen oxides,OMI instrument,ERA5,Air quality,"
"changes of extreme precipitation in the philippines, projected from the cmip6 multi-model ensemble","2022","The Philippines is highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change including increased frequency of extreme weather events such as very heavy rainfall. Extreme rain events have resulted in landslides and floods, accompanied with a loss of life and the deterioration of infrastructure. To project the future changes of extreme precipitation in Philippines, we investigated the observations based on 53 stations and 24 CMIP6 (Coupled Model Inter-Comparison Project Phase 6) models. We applied generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution and multivariate bias-correction to series of annual maximum daily precipitation (AMP1) data acquired from the observations and models under three shared socioeconomic pathway (SSP) scenarios (SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5). We employed a model ensemble method that takes both independence and performance of model into account, which is named as the PI-weighting. To quantify the uncertainty of predicting the future AMP1, variance decomposition method was applied. Return values for 20-year and 50-year as well as the return periods of the AMP1 compared to the past (1975–2014), were estimated for two future time which are period 1 (2021–2060) and period 2 (2061–2100). From this study, we predict that the relative increases of 20-year return value of the AMP1 from the past to the year 2100 be about 8.5% in the SSP2-4.5, 11.6% in the SSP3-7.0, and 17% in the SSP5-8.5 scenarios, respectively, in the spatial median over the Philippines. We also found out that a 1-in-20 year (1-in-50 year) AMP1 observed in the past in the Philippines will likely become a 1-in-16 (1-in-37) year, a 1-in-17 (1-in-32) year, and a 1-in-14 (1-in-31) year event by 2100 under the SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 scenarios, respectively. We project that heavy rainfall will be more prominent in the northwestern and mid-western part (type I area) and the eastern coast part (type II area) of the Philippines.","Analysis of variance,Relative change,Expected waiting time,Method of L-moments estimation,Shape parameter,"
"distribution of trace elements between garnet megacrysts and host volcanic liquids of kimberlitic to rhyolitic composition","1978","Abundances of rare earth elements, Hf, Sc, Co, Cr and Th in garnet megacrysts and their volcanic hosts or matrices are used to estimate garnet/liquid partition coefficients for these elements. Samples include pyropes from kimberlite and highly alkalic basalts, almandines from basalt andesite, dacite, rhyodacite and rhyolite and a spessartine-almandine from alaskite. The pyrope/host partition coefficients are fairly uniform and agree with experimental data within a factor of 2. The almandine/matrix data show more scatter (due in part to impurities in the garnet separates) but the partition coefficients tend to increase with increasing SiO ratio of the matrix. The almandine/matrix partition coefficients are up to a factor of 10 higher than the pyrope/host partition coefficients. The spessartine-almandine is strongly enriched in heavy rare earths (~ 5000 times chondrites), Y, Sc and Co. The wide variation in garnet/liquid partition coefficients from kimberlites to rhyolites cannot be explained as an effect of temperature and we conclude that a major factor is the composition of the melt from which the garnet crystallized.",""
"lagrangian analysis of multi-satellite data in support of open ocean marine protected area design","2017","Compared to ecosystem conservation in territorial seas, protecting the open ocean has peculiar geopolitical, economic and scientific challenges. One of the major obstacle is defining the boundary of an open ocean Marine Protected Area (MPA). In contrast to coastal ecosystems, which are mostly constrained by topographic structures fixed in time, the life of marine organisms in the open ocean is entrained by fluid dynamical structures like eddies and fronts, whose lifetime occurs on ecologically-relevant timescales. The position of these highly dynamical structures can vary interannually by hundreds of km, and so too will regions identified as ecologically relevant such as the foraging areas of marine predators. Thus, the expected foraging locations suggested from tracking data cannot be directly extrapolated beyond the year in which the data were collected. Here we explore the potential of Lagrangian methods applied to multisatellite data as a support tool for a MPA proposal by focusing on the Crozet archipelago oceanic area (Indian Sector of the Southern Ocean). By combining remote sensing with biologging information from a key marine top predator (Eudyptes chrysolophus, or Macaroni penguin) of the Southern Ocean foodweb, we identify a highly dynamic branch of the Subantarctic front as a foraging hotspot. By tracking this feature in historical satellite data (1993–2012) we are able to extrapolate the position of this foraging ground beyond the years in which tracking data are available and study its spatial variability.",""
"redesigned waveforms in the maritime medium frequency bands","2020","Several studies have shown that the signals of marine radio beacons, which operate in the maritime medium frequency (MF) band, can be modified to enable range and position estimate. This technology called Ranging Mode (R-Mode) faces challenges in the resolution of ambiguities and suppression of multipath interference which are related to the small bandwidth of 500 to 1000 Hz per radio beacon. This paper shows that increasing the overall used bandwidth per station with the transmission in two separate MF channels or using the complete maritime MF band would increase the ability to estimate the ambiguities and identify signals reflected by the ionosphere. A matching pursuit algorithm is proposed to decompose the received signal into the ground-wave and sky-wave component.","R-Mode,marine radio beacons,R-mode,interference suppression,complete maritime MF band,maritime medium frequency band,ranging mode,multipath channels,received signal,radiofrequency interference,radio beacon,iterative methods,frequency 500.0 Hz to 1000.0 Hz,sky wave,GNSS backup,terrestrial navigation,marine communication,time-frequency analysis,multipath interference,position estimation,"
"use of noma for maritime communication networks with p-df relaying channel","2020","In this paper, a partial de-code-and-forward (P-DF) cooperative relaying network (CRN) with non-orthogonal multiple access (P-DF-CRN-NOMA) for maritime space communications is proposed. Without loss of generality, three kinds of relay forwarding protocols are studied to characterize the superiority of the proposed P-DF-CRN-NOMA scheme, where, after receptions from the coastal base station (BS), the island relay forwards the successful decoded symbols to the ship user to avoid the performance loss provided by the high decoding requirement in decode-and-forward (DF). To further improve the system performance, as well as for a fairness comparison, the maximum ratio combining (MRC) is utilized at the ship user. Specifically, to present the impact of the channel qualities, the scenarios of the weak and strong links that from the source to destination (S-D) are both considered. The closed-form expressions for the outage probability of the P-DF-CRN-NOMA are derived considering the three proposed forwarding cases. Qualitative numerical results corroborating our theoretical analysis, especially for the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), show that the proposed P-DF-CRN-NOMA scheme significantly improves the outage probability performance in comparison to the conventional CRN-NOMA schemes. Furthermore, for an increased S-D link, the corresponding outage probability performance will be also better for all the cases.","Decoding,telecommunication network reliability,cooperative relaying networks (CRN),nonorthogonal multiple access,Marine vehicles,non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA),maritime space communications,outage probability,decoding,Power system reliability,NOMA,Communication networks,Relays,error statistics,power allocation,P-DF relaying channel,maximum ratio combining,cooperative relaying network,protocols,relay networks (telecommunication),diversity reception,partial decode and forward network,coastal base station,decode and forward communication,cooperative communication,probability,relay forwarding protocols,marine communication,outage probability performance,Probability,maritime communication networks,multi-access systems,island relay,partial decode-and-for-ward (P-DF),P-DF-CRN-NOMA scheme,"
"probabilistic associative learning of vessel motion patterns at multiple spatial scales for maritime situation awareness","2007","An improved neurobiologically inspired algorithm for situation awareness in the maritime domain is presented, which takes real-time tracking information and learns motion pattern models on-the- fly, enabling the models to adapt well to evolving situations while maintaining high levels of performance. The constantly refined models, resulting from concurrent incremental learning, are used to evaluate the behavior patterns of vessels based on their present motion states. Improvement to the associative learning law for learning temporal associations between vessel events enables conditional probabilities between events to be learned incrementally and locally. This allows weights in the learned model to be interpreted more readily, enabling better location prediction performance. Improvement in prediction performance is achieved by using multiple spatial scales to represent position, enabling the most relevant spatial scale to be used for local vessel behavior. Features and performance of these updates to the learning system using recorded data are described.","learning temporal associations,probabilistic associative learning,maritime,neural networks,Neural networks,Situation awareness,Predictive models,Learning systems,multiple spatial scales,data recording,real-time tracking information,marine engineering,Performance analysis,Training data,learning,Real time systems,Information technology,Tracking,conditional probabilities,maritime situation awareness,concurrent incremental learning,learning (artificial intelligence),Event detection,Terrorism,prediction,vessel motion patterns,"
"decision support scheduling for maritime search and rescue planning with a system of uavs and fuel service stations","2015","When maritime accidents occur, search and rescue (SAR) operations for survivors are a top priority. To conduct the SAR, a fleet of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can be used. The objective of the search task is to maximize the probability of locating targets. The goal of the rescue task is to follow survivors, transmit their location and status to the command center, and await the rescue team. In maritime SAR, the priority of a survivor being in a particular location changes with time due to current and wind. For persistent SAR operations with a system of UAVs, it is beneficial to simultaneously orchestrate the activities of multiple UAVs and fuel service stations. To address these problems, we develop a mixed integer linear program (MILP) capable of generating efficient search and rescue operation plans. For real time operations that account for unanticipated changes to the system parameters, a rolling horizon scheduling approach may be used. The MILP model is functionally capable of incorporation in such a system.","unmanned aerial vehicles,marine accidents,rescue task,system parameters,real time operations,multi-robot systems,Planning,integer programming,maritime SAR,marine safety,search task,search and rescue operation plans,UAV fleet,SAR operations,rescue robots,Real-time systems,maritime search and rescue planning,autonomous aerial vehicles,Indexes,linear programming,rolling horizon scheduling approach,rescue team,Unmanned aerial vehicles,Trajectory,search and rescue operations,Sensors,fuel service stations,maritime accidents,targets location probability,mixed integer linear program,MILP model,Fuels,decision support scheduling,"

"pitting corrosion identification approach based on inverse finite element method for marine structure applications","2023","This paper presents a state-of-the art inverse finite element method (iFEM) for full-field, real-time structural health monitoring (SHM) of corroding structures. The study focuses on detecting the location and identifying the extent of pitting corrosion, which is one of the most hazardous forms of corrosion due to the difficulties regarding its prediction and detection. For this purpose, high-fidelity finite element (FE) models of corroded samples with complex-shaped, semi-ellipsoidal, and cylindroconical defects are developed to replicate the strain field of pitting corroded structures. The strain fields produced by the FE models, verified against experimental data, are reconstructed by the iFEM model using a robust and practical four-node quadrilateral inverse-shell element, iQS4. A strain-based damage criterion is defined to obtain the damage distribution and the location of corrosion pits on dog-bone tensile test samples with full sensor iFEM and coupled iFEM-GA reduced sensor technique. Finally, in a practical example of a structure with complex geometry, the proposed method's performance is assessed through detecting the location of corrosion damage on a cylindrical marine structure with axial stiffeners.","Structural health monitoring,Marine structures,Corrosion damage detection,Inverse finite element,"
"data-driven financial and operational risk management: empirical evidence from the global tramp shipping industry","2022","The global shipping industry has long suffered from high volatilities in freight rates and bunker fuel prices that lead to significant earnings risks. This paper aims to investigate the effectiveness of financial hedging and operational risk management strategies of 31 world leading tramp shipping companies through a Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) model using various data sources. Operational risk management strategies are categorized into long-term (e.g., fleet diversity and fleet age) and short-to-medium-term (e.g., relative trip distance, fleet repositioning flexibility, and trading diversity) strategies. We innovatively quantify the short-to-medium-term operational risk management strategies using Automatic Identification System (AIS) data. The results show that financial hedging can effectively reduce bunker fuel price risk exposure but cannot reduce freight rate risk exposure. Meanwhile, companies can use operational risk management strategies to effectively reduce both risk exposures. This study provides significant implications for shipping risk management.","Financial hedging,Data analytics,Operational risk management,Bayesian belief network,Big data in shipping,Shipping risk management,"
"impact evaluation of the industrial activities in the bay of bakar (adriatic sea, croatia): recent benthic foraminifera and heavy metals","2013","The Bay of Bakar is one of the most heavily polluted bays at the Eastern Adriatic. Three major industrial companies potentially endanger the bay. The concentration of major, minor and trace elements in surface sediments from thirteen stations was discussed in relation to the sediment type and foraminiferal assemblages. The distribution of major elements in the bay is influenced by geological nature of surroundings. Heavy metal distribution depends on pollution sources and on amount of mud fraction: fine-grained sediments are enriched by them in comparison with coarse-grained ones. Different sediment quality criteria complicate the pollution assessment in the bay. Heavy metal concentrations generally fall into allowed depositional values for marine environments; only area in front of the coke plant and the City of Bakar harbor is heavily polluted. Stress-tolerant foraminiferal species dominate at stations with higher concentrations of heavy metals and coarse-grained sediments consist of larger number of epifaunal taxa.","Major,Pollution,Adriatic Sea,Sediment,Foraminifera,minor and trace elements,"
"evaluating the impact of atmospheric deposition on dissolved trace-metals in the gulf of aqaba, red sea","2011","Trace metals in the ocean act as both essential micro-nutrients and as toxins. There are relatively few multi-element studies of dissolved trace metals in the ocean, and none from the Gulf of Aqaba, Red Sea. This semi-enclosed basin surrounded by desert is a natural laboratory for studying the impact of atmospheric dry deposition of trace metals on the ocean surface. We have combined measurement of dissolved metals in seawater with measurements of the flux of metals associated with dry deposition. The total dissolved trace metal concentrations in Gulf of Aqaba water are generally higher (Fe, Cu, Zn, Co, Mn, Pb) or similar (Ni, Al, Cd, Mo) to those measured in the open North Atlantic Ocean. The concentrations of elements that are highly enriched in aerosols relative to Al (e.g. Cd, Pb, Zn and Cu) are not necessarily proportionally enriched in surface seawater when compared to Al, indicative of the high reactivity of these elements in seawater. Iron concentrations in the Gulf of Aqaba are high relative to Al, despite the fact that the aerosols are not more enriched in Fe relative to Al. There may be additional sources of dissolved iron to the Gulf of Aqaba, not associated with Al. Alternatively, intense photochemically-driven redox cycling may act to enhance Fe dissolution from aerosols, or may otherwise increase the lifetime of Fe in the water column, relative to Al. Copper concentrations in the Gulf of Aqaba are close to the value found to be a threshold for Cu toxicity in this region. A surface maximum in Cd:P is found in the Gulf of Aqaba, in contrast to the more typical surface minimum in this ratio observed in other locations. The surface maximum appears to be driven by atypically low uptake of Cd relative to P. A low Cd:P uptake ratio for this region is consistent with known environmental determinants of low Cd:P uptake, such as high concentrations of dissolved Zn and Fe, and a predominance of small phytoplankton including cyanobacteria.","Oligotrophic,Gulf of Aqaba,Cadmium,Trace metals,Dry deposition,"

"bi-objective optimal planning for emergency resource allocation in the maritime oil spill accident response phase under uncertainty","2019","Emergency resource allocation is an important issue in emergency response to marine oil spill accident. This paper addresses an emergency resource allocation problem which involves multiple relief resource center and one accident point. To solve this problem, a bi-objective model is constructed to minimize the disposal time and the disposal costs. Due to the existence of uncertainty in different aspects involved in the emergency response to the marine oil spill, we also incorporated into the model some fuzzy parameters. An algorithm based on the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II and the differential evolution algorithm, was presented to obtain the Pareto set. The technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution method was employed to reach a final compromise solution. A case was studied to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and the hybrid algorithm, which can support the decision making in the process of the oil spill emergency disposal.","accident point,emergency management,oil spill emergency disposal,maritime oil spill accident,fuzzy programming,multiple relief resource center,genetic algorithms,oil pollution,Pareto set,emergency resource allocation problem,Resource allocation,marine oil spill accident,decision making,maritime oil spill accident response phase,emergency response,fuzzy set theory,bi-objective model,Pareto optimisation,uncertainty,NSGA-II,bi-objective optimal planning,resource allocation,sorting genetic algorithm-II,"
"modelling fire perimeter formation in the canadian rocky mountains","2022","Wildfires produce a mosaic of burned and unburned patches across varying temporal and spatial scales and provide a range of essential ecosystem services. Fire perimeters mark the separation between the burned and unburned matrix of a fire. Analysis of fire perimeters in the United States, Australia, and Alberta, have identified several key factors that influence the formation of a fire boundary, including fire environment variables, such as fuel, weather, and topographic conditions, as well as anthropogenic factors. We used matched case-control conditional logistic regression to assess the fire environment's influence on the formation of fire boundaries on the 2017 Verdant Creek Fire in the western Canadian Rocky Mountain region. Results indicated that fire boundary formation was strongly influenced by non-fuels, alpine and subalpine vegetation, wetland areas, and low and sparse shrub assemblages generally associated with avalanche paths. Fire cessation was more likely near waterways; however, the fire weather conditions that characterized most burning periods likely overrode other topographic influences. Fire cessation was most likely to occur one day following precipitation events when Vapour Pressure Deficit and Fire Weather Index values decreased. To explore the potential influence of spatial data resolution and fire mapping limitations on our results, we varied the distance between matched sample points selected on each side of the mapped fire perimeter during statistical modelling. Results demonstrated matched pairs of burned and unburned sample points were effective at representing discrete states when separated by at least 100 m and that insufficient or excessive separation between matched pairs confounds results, highlighting the importance of sensitivity analysis for determining the appropriate separation distance to represent burned and unburned states. We demonstrate a practical application of the model to predict spread potential, enabling rapid visual assessment of landscape locations most likely to limit fire spread.","Spatial analysis,Rocky Mountain forests,Wildland fire,Risk analysis,Fire extinguishment,Matched case-control conditional logistic regression,"
"joint design of channel estimation and flocking control for multi-auv-based maritime transportation systems","2023","Communication efficiency and flocking stability are two basic requirements for the application of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) in maritime transportation systems. Although they are closely related, most existing flocking approaches focus on the control techniques and ignore the influence of communication efficiency. This paper presents a joint design solution to the channel estimation and flocking control for multi-AUV-based maritime transportation systems, with the consideration of path loss, shadow and multipath fading channels. A value iteration-based reinforcement learning (RL) estimator is first designed to predict the channel quality of AUVs in positions that have not yet visited. With the predicted channel quality, we construct an integrated optimization problem for the co-design of communication and flocking strategies. Along with this, a value iteration-based RL flocking controller is developed to achieve the co-design of channel estimation and flocking control for AUVs. It is worth mentioning that, the value iteration-based RL estimator in this paper can avoid local optimal in traditional least-squares methods, and meanwhile the flocking controller in this paper can make a balance between flocking stability and communication efficiency for AUVs. Finally, simulation and experimental results reveal that the proposed approach in this paper has superior performances by comparing with the other works. As such, our approach is more useful for marine engineer to understand and explore the maritime transportation system from the communication and control view points.","Underwater acoustics,Vehicle dynamics,Transportation,reinforcement learning,Communication-aware,Fading channels,Mathematical models,flocking,Channel estimation,autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs),Force,"
"resource allocation for ofdm-based maritime edge computing networks","2020","Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs) can support various maritime applications, such as ocean environment monitoring and target tracking applications.

"a time domain-based iterative method for helicopter maritime search area planning and construction of the simulation environment","2020","Helicopters are widely used in maritime search and rescue (SAR) missions. To improve the probability of success (POS) of SAR missions, search areas should be carefully planned. However, the search area is usually determined based on the survivors' probable locations at a given moment by existing planning methods, while the effects of the relative motion between the helicopter and the search objects are ignored, possibly leading to a significant decrease in the POS. To minimize the impact of search object motion, a time domain-based iterative planning (TIP) method is proposed in this article to obtain the optimal search areas. The survivors' probable locations and mean drift direction are updated iteratively, while the probability map is developed by taking survivors' mean drift direction as a reference. Then, the optimal search area is determined by an iterative search method starting from the cell with the highest probability of containment. To evaluate the effectiveness of a search plan, an agent-based simulation environment of a maritime search mission is constructed based on the AnyLogic simulation platform. Taking a capsizing case as an example, the simulation results show that the novel TIP method minimizes the impact of search object motion on the search effectiveness and obtains higher POS values than those obtained by other methods.","TIP method,maritime search mission,search plan,Planning,Search problems,Agent-based modeling,POS,Helicopters,planning methods,motion control,simulation environment,aircraft control,optimisation,time domain-based iterative planning method,synthetic aperture radar,optimal search area,anyLogic,helicopter maritime search area planning,mean drift direction,iterative methods,search problems,probability map,search and rescue,Trajectory,helicopters,mission area planning,probability,SAR missions,Iterative methods,Computational modeling,search objects,Fuels,"
"spatial assessment and source identification of heavy metals pollution in surface water using several chemometric techniques","2016","This study presents the determination of the spatial variation and source identification of heavy metal pollution in surface water along the Straits of Malacca using several chemometric techniques. Clustering and discrimination of heavy metal compounds in surface water into two groups (northern and southern regions) are observed according to level of concentrations via the application of chemometric techniques. Principal component analysis (PCA) demonstrates that Cu and Cr dominate the source apportionment in northern region with a total variance of 57.62% and is identified with mining and shipping activities. These are the major contamination contributors in the Straits. Land-based pollution originating from vehicular emission with a total variance of 59.43% is attributed to the high level of Pb concentration in the southern region. The results revealed that one state representing each cluster (northern and southern regions) is significant as the main location for investigating heavy metal concentration in the Straits of Malacca which would save monitoring cost and time.

"shallow electrical resistivity imaging of the limón fault, chagres river watershed, panama canal","2017","The aim of this study was the use of electrical resistivity imaging to investigate the geometry of the southwest portion of one of the most important geologic fault zones of the Panama Canal Watershed: the Limón fault. This fault is characterized by its juxtaposition of pre-Tertiary andesitic basalt (Playa Venado Formation) against late Oligocene Tertiary sediments (Caimito Formation). In this zone, four 2D electrical resistivity tomography profiles were conducted perpendicular to the fault trace: T-1, T-2, T-3 and T-4. The T-1, T-3, and T-4 profiles were long profiles (235m for the first two and 215m for the last one), with a goal of determining the depth of the geologic boundary between the sedimentary and andesitic deposits. The T-2 profile was a short profile (23.5m), with the objective of calibrating the results with data provided by the paleoseismic trenching previously developed in the area of interest. For these tests, two electrode arrays of types Wenner-Schlumberger and Dipole-Dipole, were used. For the inversion routine, two regularized least-squares methods were used: the smoothness-constrained method and robust inversion. The long electrical resistivity tomography profiles were able to identify a set of electrical anomalies associated with the andesitic basalt and the Tertiary sediments and with that, the contact geometry between these formations. In these profiles, fault angle measurements ranged from 60° to 80° with respect to the ground surface. In the T-2 profile, the electrical anomalies showed a good association with the results of the paleoseismic study. This allowed identification of the colluvium and alluvium covering the gravel and sand debris that mark the gradual transition to the soils of the Caimito Formation. Finally, a set of 2D synthetic models was developed for each of the T-1, T-3, and T-4 profiles with the objective of optimizing interpretation of the field results.","Panama,Paleoseismology,Limón fault,Playa Venado Formation,Caimito Formation,Electrical resistivity tomography (ERT),"

Results of these processes within 50–80 years after abandoning mercury mines are studied. A long time interval has thus passed between ceasing raw material extraction and conducting research on natural restoration, so it is possible to confidently evaluate abilities and effects of self-restoration under specific climatic and landscape-geochemical conditions. The following environmental components were studied at mercury mining sites:–local topography;–plant species composition and its biogeochemical characteristics;–biological cycle of chemical elements;–properties of soils (primarily, geochemical) at mines and surrounding areas. The mercury mining sites studied are situated in various landscape-geochemical and climatic conditions, in medium-altitude mountainous forest landscapes of Caucasus. Two mines differ in temperature conditions and the amount of precipitation, although the straight-line distance between them is less than 100km.

"a-contrario structural inference for space object detection and tracking","2022","Monitoring space assets for safety and sustainability compliance requires active measurement of positional information, commonly done via optical remote sensing in which image-frame coordinates are extracted from a high-noise environment of stellar, atmospheric, and hardware features. This task has been traditionally approached by using a-priori models to differentiate potential Anthropogenic Space Objects from the background noise. Source extraction and track-before-detect methods rely on absolute pixel intensity thresholding and require substantial processing to remove noise (stars, hot pixels, etc.), while machine learning shows promise in reducing processing and improving low-visibility performance but requires context-specific labeled training data. We introduce a new approach based on a-contrario detection, arguing that any space object must be unattributable to noise using a sequence of low-fidelity hypotheses. Through this approach, we aim to relax the dependency on a-priori assumptions of data content and improve performance where high-quality data is sparse, poorly labeled, or challenging to characterize, e.g., in satellite-based applications, and provide detection confidence measures from individual data content to enhance risk evaluation for orbital populations. We present an initial qualitative proof-of-concept for our a-contrario approach using data collected by the ASTRIANet telescope network, showing potentially strong performance on Medium Earth Orbit observations for both rate and sidereal-tracking telescope modes. We also discuss how our approach handles epistemic uncertainties, i.e., a lack of a-priori model information, with implications to Type I and Type II error sources and potential mitigation steps when considering Low Earth Orbit observations with higher tracking noise.","Object tracking,A-contrario detection,Space domain awareness,Image processing,"
"modelled and measured transboundary acidifying pollution in europe— verification and trends","1993","The routine acid deposition model at MSC-W EMEP has been run for 5 years. Routine measurements taken by countries participating in EMEP are so far available from CCC EMEP for hour of these years. This paper aims at demonstrating the usefulness of having access to simultaneous sets of data, such as measurements and model-calculated quantities for which one can vary the determining parameters. By comparing the data sets with emissions used in the calculations, one can identify both important model shortcomings as well as probable errors in measurements and emissions. Furthermore, trends in manual deposition and concentration levels can be investigated by controlling the meteorological input in order to filter out the effect of meteoroligical variability. In general, errors in modelled concentrations can only be identified with confidence if a statistically sufficient number of stations agree. This is the case for NO2 in air for which the model seems to underestimate systematically the measured concentrations, and for sulphate and nitrate in precipitation for which the model gives persistently lower concentrations than measured over peripheral areas in Europe. A majority of the “outliers” in the scatter plots comparing measurements and calculations are seen to be connected with clear misfits between emission data and measured values. Furthermore, at a few sites measurements show much larger variations from year to year than anticipated. The trend experiments emphasize the importance of meteorological variability as compared to emission changes. Even if the impacts of emission trends can be larger than those of meteorological variations at some sites, the complex spatial pattern caused by the latter completely masks the former. Measurements, being influenced by changes in both conditions, are thus of limited value for a year-to-year monitoring of emission reduction effects. Keeping the meteorology the same from year to year in the model calculations, reveals that calculated air concentrations and depositions correspond to the reported emissions. Trends in measurements and calculations generally agree well, except that for sulphur in air 1989 measured concentrations are smaller than calculated. This is believed to be a consequence of too high emission numbers for SO2 in 1989. The conclusions that can be drawn from this study are direct consequences of the distribution of measurement sites in Europe as part of EMEP. This distribution favours central European areas north of the Alps. The statistical confidence and representativity of the results would be much improved by a more evenly distributed measurement network.","pollution trends,long-range transport,verification,Acid deposition,"

"application of maritime ais (automatic identification system) to ads-b (automatic dependent surveillance â€” broadcast) transceiver","2010","International Maritime Organization (IMO) recommends the installation of an Automatic Identification System (AIS) according to requirements by SOLAS to avoid maritime collision. The AIS provides traffic information of other ships that may be used for maritime traffic control, SAR (Search and Rescue) and collision avoidance to apply safety management. In this paper, preliminary results to implement an aeronautical surveillance transceiver using AIS transceiver based on ADS-B concepts are described. Although altitude information is not required for AIS since the AIS is operated at MSL (Mean Sea Level), altitude information can be extracted by a GPS (Global Positioning System) chip-set in the AIS transceiver. ADS-B transceiver is implemented by defining a surveillance message format including the altitude information and modifying SOTDMA (Self-Organizing Time Division Multiple Access) protocol. Flight tests are performed to verify the implementation results.","Search and Rescue,surveillance,Automatic Identification System (AIS),Airplanes,Safety,maritime collision,Marine vehicles,ADS-B,Global Positioning System,safety management,Transceivers,Automatic Dependent Surveillance â€” Broadcast (ADS-B),Global Positioning System (GPS),SOLAS,Automatic Identification System,International Maritime Organization,Mean Sea Level,maritime AIS,Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast transceiver,maritime traffic control,GPS,AIS transceiver,Self-Organizing Time Division Multiple Access protocol,traffic information,traffic control,Surveillance,collision avoidance,marine control,transceivers,Self-Organizing Time Division Multiple Access (SOTDMA),SOTDMA,aeronautical surveillance transceiver,"
"interval prediction of vessel trajectory based on lower and upper bound estimation and attention-modified lstm with bayesian optimization","2023","Uncertainty prediction of vessel trajectory is essential to enhance maritime situational awareness and traffic safety. Traditional approaches for trajectory prediction face challenges in accurately quantifying uncertainties, thereby limiting effectiveness in decision-making. To address this challenge, we propose a hybrid interval prediction frame of vessel trajectory using the lower and upper bound estimation (LUBE) and attention-modified long short-term memory (LSTM) network with bayesian optimization (BO). Firstly, trajectory data is preprocessed to solve the scale irregularity. Then, a novel trajectory interval prediction model for perceiving the prediction uncertainties is designed based on an advanced attention-modified LSTM with interval prediction capability. Meanwhile, a supervised training strategy with differentiating the interval widths of latitude and longitude is put forward to devise sample labels for training the model. Additionally, a new prediction interval-based objective function is proposed considering the target of maximizing coverage and minimizing width of trajectory interval. The BO algorithm optimizes the weighted parameters in the LSTM network by minimizing the objective function value. Finally, cases from two water areas are implemented to test and verify the proposed method. The results illustrate the superiority of the proposed approach in (1) outperforming other methods used for comparison in both coverage probability and width criteria of prediction interval. (2) quantifying the prediction uncertainty and improving the reliability of trajectory predictor. (3) performing anomaly detection tasks using visualized trajectory prediction intervals. The research can help maritime traffic participants obtain more reliable trajectory data, which supports making more reasonable traffic supervision decisions.","Long short-term memory,Attention mechanism,Vessel trajectory,Lower and upper bound estimation (LUBE),Interval prediction,"
"maritime small target detection based on appearance stability and depth-normalized motion saliency in infrared video with dense sunglints","2023","Maritime infrared (IR) small target detection in dense sunglint environments has always been challenging. It is difficult for existing methods to distinguish the small target from dense and strong sea clutter because the sea clutter caused by the sunglints has similar spatialâ€“temporal characteristics to small targets. This article proposes a method based on appearance stability and depth-normalized motion saliency (AS-DNMS) for small target detection in IR videos or sequences. First, on each frame of the IR video, the isotropic salience measure (ISM) based on principal curvature filtering is proposed for target enhancement, and an adaptive threshold is used to extract a stable number of candidate targets. Then, we use improved pipeline filtering to form trajectory chains of the candidate targets extracted from the consecutive frames. To improve the matching accuracy of pipeline filtering, we propose an inverse optical flow method to predict the local images of the candidate targets. Third, the motion vectors of the candidate targets are extracted and depth-normalized. According to the principle of projection perspective, a depth normalization model based on the position of the sea-sky line is established, providing a simple and low-cost solution for acquiring depth information of maritime targets under sea-sky backgrounds. Finally, the appearance stability measure (ASM) and the depth-normalized motion saliency measure (DNMSM) are calculated to construct the AS-DNMS joint feature. A double asymptote decision function is employed to determine the real target. The experimental results show that our method has better detection performance in dense sunglint environments than the baseline methods.","Appearance stability and depth-normalized motion saliency (AS-DNMS),Pipelines,target detection,radar clutter,target enhancement,Sea measurements,IR video,dense sunglint environment,strong sea clutter,isotropic salience measure (ISM),object detection,dense sunglints,feature extraction,maritime targets,Sea surface,improved pipeline filtering,infrared (IR) small target detection,depth-normalized motion saliency measure,dense sunglint environments,depth normalization model,Trajectory,image sequences,Tensors,Clutter,Object detection,appearance stability measure,infrared video,sequences,candidate targets,sea-sky line,isotropic salience measure,pipeline filtering,dense sea clutter,"
"sa-hpmht for maritime dim targets tracking with sensor location uncertainty","2023","To address the problem of tracking low signal-to-clutter ratio (SCR) maritime targets with sensor location uncertainty, an effective track-before-detect (TBD) method, called the state augmentation histogram probabilistic multihypothesis tracking (SA-HPMHT) algorithm, is proposed in this article. In this algorithm, the initialization of new tracks is realized based on the constant false alarm rate (CFAR) detector with a low threshold and the  ${K}$ -means clustering algorithm. The target and sensor states are then simultaneously estimated in an iterative manner via a synthetic histogram and state augmentation (SA) method. In each iteration, we update the estimated sensor state and yield more accurate measured images, allowing for improved performance of detection and tracking targets. Finally, an  ${M}/{N}$  logic technology is invoked to confirm or terminate the tracks. The results of simulation and real dataset verification show that the SA-HPMHT algorithm has a better performance compared with the histogram probabilistic multihypothesis tracking (H-PMHT) algorithm and the sequential Monte Carlo probability hypothesis density (SMC-PHD) algorithm.","Monte Carlo methods,track before detect (TBD),maritime dim target,radar detection,state augmentation (SA),Sea measurements,SA-HPMHT algorithm,Covariance matrices,target tracking,constant false alarm rate detector,Histogram-probabilistic multihypothesis tracking (PMHT),sensor placement,Target tracking,synthetic histogram,radar tracking,sensor states,sequential Monte Carlo probability hypothesis density algorithm,probability,Uncertainty,Image resolution,Clutter,low signal-to-clutter ratio,Sensors,maritime dim targets tracking,effective track-before-detect method,state augmentation histogram probabilistic multihypothesis tracking algorithm,sensor location uncertainty,"
"physical-biological drivers modulating phytoplankton seasonal succession along the northern antarctic peninsula","2023","The Northern Antarctic Peninsula (NAP) shows shifts in phytoplankton distribution and composition along its warming marine ecosystems. However, despite recent efforts to mechanistically understand these changes, little focus has been given to the phytoplankton seasonal succession, remaining uncertainties regarding to distribution patterns of emerging taxa along the NAP. To fill this gap, we collected phytoplankton (pigment and microscopy analysis) and physico-chemical datasets during spring and summer (November, February and March) of 2013/2014 and 2014/2015 off the NAP. Satellite measurements (sea surface temperature, sea ice concentration and chlorophyll-a) were used to extend the temporal coverage of analysis associated with the in situ sampling. We improved the quantification and distribution pattern of emerging taxa, such as dinoflagellates and cryptophytes, and described a contrasting seasonal behavior and distinct fundamental niche between centric and pennate diatoms. Cryptophytes and pennate diatoms preferentially occupied relatively shallower mixing layers compared with centric diatoms and dinoflagellates, suggesting differences between these groups in distribution and environment occupation over the phytoplankton seasonal succession. Under colder conditions, negative sea surface temperature anomalies were associated with positive anomalies of sea ice concentration and duration. Therefore, based on sea ice–phytoplankton growth relationship, large phytoplankton biomass accumulation was expected during the spring/summer of 2013/2014 and 2014/2015 along the NAP. However, there was a decoupling between sea ice concentration/duration and phytoplankton biomass, characterizing two seasonal periods of low biomass accumulation (negative chlorophyll-a anomalies), associated with the top-down control in the region. These results provide an improved mechanistic understanding on physical-biological drivers modulating phytoplankton seasonal succession along the Antarctic coastal waters.","Shifts,Top-down control,Upper ocean physical structures,Southern ocean,Phytoplankton taxa,Climate change,"
"seamless and energy-efficient maritime coverage in coordinated 6g spaceâ€“airâ€“sea non-terrestrial networks","2023","Non-terrestrial networks (NTNs), which integrate space and aerial networks with terrestrial systems, are a key area in the emerging sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks. As part of 6G, NTNs must provide pervasive connectivity to a wide range of devices, including smartphones, vehicles, sensors, robots, and maritime users. However, due to the high mobility and deployment of NTNs, managing the space-airâ€“sea (SAS) NTN resources, i.e., energy, power, and channel allocation, is a major challenge. The design of an SAS-NTN for energy-efficient resource allocation is investigated in this study. The goal is to maximize system energy efficiency (EE) by collaboratively optimizing user equipment (UE) association, power control, and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) deployment. Given the limited payloads of UAVs, this work focuses on minimizing the total energy cost of UAVs (trajectory and transmission) while meeting EE requirements. A mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem is proposed, followed by the development of an algorithm to decompose, and solve each problem distributedly. The binary (UE association) and continuous (power, deployment) variables are separated using the Bender decomposition (BD), and then the Dinkelbach algorithm (DA) is used to convert fractional programming into an equivalent solvable form in the subproblem. A standard optimization solver is utilized to deal with the complexity of the master problem for binary variables. The alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm is used to solve the subproblem for the continuous variables. Our proposed algorithm provides a suboptimal solution, and simulation results demonstrate that the algorithm achieves better EE and spectral efficiency (SE) than baselines.","Satellites,telecommunication power management,channel allocation,binary variables,coordinated 6G,telecommunication computing,total energy cost,convex programming,energy-efficient resource allocation,sixth-generation (6G) networking,integer programming,Resource management,multipliers algorithm,Alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM),concave programming,terrestrial systems,space-air-sea NTN resources,5G mobile communication,spectral efficiency,continuous variables,unmanned aerial vehicle deployment,energy-efficient maritime coverage,optimisation,high mobility,Low earth orbit satellites,nonterrestrial networks,satellite-access networks,Dinkelbach algorithm (DA),key area,6G mobile communication,mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem,Synthetic aperture sonar,master problem,NTNs,spaceâ€“airâ€“sea (SAS) communication,Satellite constellations,Satellite broadcasting,autonomous aerial vehicles,aerial networks,nonlinear programming,power control,Bender decomposition (BD),maritime users,pervasive connectivity,standard optimization solver,system energy efficiency,marine communication,energy conservation,emerging sixth-generation wireless networks,Dinkelbach algorithm,seamless,UE association,user equipment association,resource allocation,Backhaul networks,unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV),UAV,"
"grid size optimization for potential field based maritime anomaly detection","2014","This study focuses on improving the potential field based maritime data modeling method, developed to extract traffic patterns and detect anomalies, in a clear, understandable and informative way. The method's novelty lies in employing the concept of a potential field for AIS vessel tracking data abstraction and maritime traffic representation. Unlike the traditional maritime surveillance equipment, such as radar or GPS, the AIS system comprehensively represents the identity and properties of a vessel, as well as its behavior, thus preserving the effects of navigational decisions, based on the skills of experienced seamen. In the developed data modeling process, every vessel generates potential charges, which value represent the vessel's behavior, and drops the charges at locations it passes. Each AIS report is used to assign a potential charge at the reported vessel positions. The method derives three construction elements, which define, firstly, how charges are accumulated, secondly, how a charge decays over time, and thirdly, in what way the potential is distributed around the source charge. The collection of potential fields represents a model of normal behavior, and vessels not conforming to it are marked as anomalous. In the anomaly detection prototype system STRAND, the sensitivity of anomaly detection can be modified by setting a geographical coordinate grid precision to more dense or coarse. The objective of this study is to identify the optimal grid size for two different conditions – an open sea and a port area case. A noticeable shift can be observed between the results for the open sea and the port area. The plotted detection rates converge towards an optimal ratio for smaller grid sizes in the port area (60-200 meters), than in the open sea case (300-1000 meters). The effective outcome of the potential filed based anomaly detection is filtering out all vessels behaving normally and presenting a set of anomalies, for a subsequent incident analysis using STRAND as an information visualization tool.","maritime traffic,potential field,anomaly detection,AIS,"

"mobility-aware resource management for integrated satellite-maritime mobile networks","2022","The rapid development of the blue economy has generated fast growth in the demand for maritime communications, which requires strong network capacities. Due to the poor climate and construction conditions, maritime communications significantly lag behind their terrestrial counterparts, which hinders the application and optimization of maritime mobile services. Recently, the cloud-edge-terminal (CET) architecture has enabled terrestrial mobile users to use all devices and facilities collaboratively, which effectively alleviates network pressure and improves users' quality of experience (QoE). To bring these advantages to the maritime scenario, this article proposes an integrated satellite-maritime CET architecture, and considers the mobility of maritime vehicles in network resource management, including integrated transmission optimization, CET offloading, and proactive caching with resource-sharing maritime edge clusters.

"feature enhancement and supervised contrastive learning for image splicing forgery detection","2023","Image forgery detection remains a challenging task due to the variation in the scale of the tampered areas and the forensic clues that are obscured by various post-processing operations. Most existing deep learning methods rely only on single-scale high-level features and ignore the correlations of the pixels in intra-image and inter-image. Due to this limitation, previous methods are considered unsuitable for multi-scale splicing forgery detection. To fill this gap, we propose a novel model for improving multi-scale splicing forged regions localization by utilizing multi-level multi-scale feature enhancement and pixel-level supervised contrastive learning. First, we introduce a multi-level multi-scale feature enhancement module (MFEM) to integrate the multi-level information and capture the multi-scale global contextual representation by embedding an improved atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) mechanism into the non-local module. It strengthens the capability of the model to sense multi-scale tampered regions. Second, the pixel-level supervised contrastive learning mechanism is designed to separately cluster the pixel representations of tampered and real regions within and across images. It improves intra-class compactness and inter-class separability of the pixel embedding space significantly and enhances feature expression capabilities. Third, we design a multi-loss progressive learning (MPL) strategy to integrate the complementary advantages of multi-loss functions to optimize the scale and position parameters of the tampered regions during the training process. Extensive experiments have shown that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods. It can effectively detect and segment multi-scale tampered regions, even for noisy and JPEG-compressed images.","Supervised contrastive learning,Feature enhancement,Global contextual representations,Image forgery,"

"exploring the nature of buried linear features in the qatar peninsula: archaeological and paleoclimatic implications","2022","The absence of large archaeological settlements in the Eastern Arabian Peninsula suggests that most of the recent wet periods occurring during climate oscillations in these areas were short-lived. However, a ∼ 2-by-3-km buried rectangular feature was discovered opportunistically in the southeast of the Qatar Peninsula while performing radar subsurface mapping of structural conduits for groundwater characterization. The feature is characterized by its unique contrasting patterns of surface and subsurface roughness as well as its organic-rich mixture of soils, as assessed from high-resolution radar and multispectral observations, respectively, and validated with GPR and EM subsurface probing. The above characteristics could be the only remaining evidence for a large primitive settlement due to the harsh erosive setting. To explore the natural or anthropogenic origin of this anomalous feature, we compare its dimensions, structural setting, roughness, and composition to similar formations in the Qatar Peninsula and other arid karst environments. Findings suggest that the feature is texturally and compositionally unique within the Qatar Peninsula, and is not reproduced in other arid karst terrains nor reproduced by the fracture patterns associated with the Qatar-South Fars Arch. We hypothesize that the feature is a karst depression modified by semi-stationary primitive human settlements ∼ 3640 BP or earlier based on radiocarbon dating of in-situ charcoal samples. Moreover, the organic-rich mixture of soil and the occurrence of several symmetrical features observed inside the perimeter suggest that landscaping, farming and irrigation activities could have occurred within the site, further suggesting that long-lasting wet conditions—with sufficient fresh water resources or reliance on karst aquifers—were able to sustain a relatively large primitive settlement not previously witnessed in the region’s archaeological record. Future improvements in the resolution and coverage of orbital L-band radar observations, as used above, can provide new insights into understanding prehistoric human occupation under fluctuating climatic conditions and groundwater dynamics in these hyper-arid regions.","Desert hydrology,Archaeology,Optical and radar imagery,Land classification,Paleoclimate,Structural elements,"
"crystallization pathways, fabrics and the capture of climate proxies in speleothems: examples from the tropics","2022","The quality of climate proxy data from speleothem archives depends to varying degrees on crystallization processes, which result in diverse fabrics. Here, we document shifts in calcite growth mechanisms, from ion-by-ion to nanoparticle/nanocrystal attachment, in stalagmites from the tropical island of Atiu (South Pacific). Changes in solution stoichiometry and organic matter content result in the development of two columnar fabrics that are common elsewhere in settings characterized by seasonal contrast. A porous columnar fabric, characterized by intracrystalline micro and nanoporosity grows via a non-classical pathway through amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) nanoparticles (∼2–4 nm in diameter) and calcite nanocrystal attachment. Despite subsequent transformation of nanoparticles/crystals into a large calcite crystal, the porous columnar fabric appears to preserve a δ18O signal that faithfully reflects that of the parent fluid via quasi-equilibrium fractionation. Furthermore, the porous fabric shows random and fuzzy lateral distributions of Sr, another hydrological proxy, yet this element's incorporation follows equilibrium partitioning. The chemical properties of compact columnar fabrics, which appear to grow by classical ion-by-ion attachment, may not directly reflect those of the original depositional environment because of degassing, the presence of growth inhibitors (such as Na) and very early diagenetic modifications. Columnar porous calcite fabrics that formed through non-classical pathways in other settings may faithfully record the original properties of the parent drip water, whereas compact fabrics that formed through classical pathways elsewhere may not. It is concluded that the study of fabrics at the nano-scale is a necessary complement to speleothem research to identify the influence of crystallization pathways on the accuracy of proxy data.","Fabrics,Speleothem,Non-classical crystallization,Amorphous calcium carbonate,Stable isotopes,Trace elements,Nanocrystals,"
"environmental controls on the 2h/1h values of terrestrial leaf waxes in the eastern canadian arctic","2013","The hydrogen isotope composition of plant waxes preserved in lacustrine sediments is a potentially valuable tool for reconstructing paleoenvironmental changes in the Arctic. However, in contrast to the mid- and low-latitudes, significantly less effort has been directed towards understanding the factors controlling D/H fractionation in high latitude plant waxes and the impact of these processes on the interpretation of sedimentary leaf wax δD records. To better understand these processes, we examined the D/H ratios of long chain fatty acids in lake surface sediments spanning a temperature and precipitation gradient on Baffin Island in the eastern Canadian Arctic. D/H ratios of plant waxes increase with increasing temperature and aridity, with values ranging from −240‰ to −160‰ over the study area. Apparent fractionation factors between n-alkanoic acids in Arctic lake sediments and precipitation(εFA-ppt) are less negative than those of mid-latitude lakes and modern plants by 25‰ to 65‰, consistent with n-alkane data from modern Arctic plants (Yang et al., 2011). Furthermore, εFA-ppt values from Arctic lakes become systematically more positive with increasing evaporation, in contrast to mid-latitude sites, which show little to no change in fractionation with aridity. These data are consistent with enhanced water loss and isotope fractionation at higher latitude in the Arctic summer, when continuous sunlight supports increased daily photosynthesis. The dominant control on δDFA variations on Baffin Island is temperature. However, changing εFA-ppt result in steeper δDFA–temperature relationships than observed for modern precipitation. The application of this δDFA-based paleotemperature calibration to existing δDFA records from Baffin Island produces much more realistic changes in late Holocene temperature and highlights the importance of these effects in influencing the interpretation of Arctic δDFA records. A better understanding of the controls on hydrogen isotope fractionation in high latitude leaf waxes will be essential to the proper interpretation of isotope records from sedimentary plant waxes in the Arctic.",""

"deeptracks: geopositioning maritime vehicles in video acquired from a moving platform","2021","Geopositioning and tracking a moving boat at sea is a very challenging problem, requiring boat detection, matching and estimating its GPS location from imagery with no common features. The problem can be stated as follows: given imagery from a camera mounted on a moving platform with known GPS location as the only valid sensor, we predict the geoposition of a target boat visible in images. Our solution uses recent ML algorithms, the camera-scene geometry and Bayesian filtering. The proposed pipeline first detects and tracks the target boatâ€™s location in the image with the strategy of tracking by detection. This image location is then converted to geoposition to the local sea coordinates referenced to the camera GPS location using plane projective geometry. Finally, target boat local coordinates are transformed to global GPS coordinates to estimate the geoposition. To achieve a smooth geotrajectory, we apply unscented Kalman filter (UKF) which implicitly overcomes small detection errors in the early stages of the pipeline. We tested the performance of our approach using GPS ground truth and show the accuracy and speed of the estimated geopositions.

"detecting anomalous deviations from standard maritime routes using the ornsteinâ€“uhlenbeck process","2018","A novel anomaly detection procedure based on the Ornsteinâ€“Uhlenbeck (OU) mean-reverting stochastic process is presented. The considered anomaly is a vessel that deviates from a planned route, changing its nominal velocity $\boldsymbol{v}_0$. In order to hide this behavior, the vessel switches off its automatic identification system (AIS) device for a time  $T$ and then tries to revert to the previous nominal velocity $\boldsymbol{v}_0$. The decision that has to be made is declaring that a deviation either happened or not, relying only upon two consecutive AIS contacts. Furthermore, the extension to the scenario in which multiple contacts (e.g., radar) are available during the time period $T$ is also considered.

"trajectory design for uav-enabled maritime secure communications: a reinforcement learning approach","2022","This paper investigates an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled maritime secure communication network, where the UAV aims to provide the communication service to a legitimate mobile vessel in the presence of multiple eavesdroppers. In this maritime communication networks (MCNs), it is challenging for the UAV to determine its trajectory on the ocean, since it cannot land or replenish energy on the sea surface, the trajectory should be pre-designed before the UAV takes off. Furthermore, the take-off location of the UAV and the sea lane of the vessel may be random, which leads to a highly dynamic environment. To address these issues, we propose two reinforcement learning schemes, Q-learning and deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithms, to solve the discrete and continuous UAV trajectory design problem, respectively. Simulation results are provided to validate the effectiveness and superior performance of the proposed reinforcement learning schemes versus the existing schemes in the literature. Additionally, the proposed DDPG algorithm converges faster and achieves higher utilities for the UAV, compared to the Q-learning algorithm.","Satellites,telecommunication security,physical layer security,remotely operated vehicles,Marine vehicles,control engineering computing,reinforcement learning schemes,unmanned aerial vehicle-enabled maritime secure communication network,MCN,UAV-enabled maritime secure communications,trajectory design,reinforcement learning,communication service,Autonomous aerial vehicles,continuous UAV trajectory design problem,autonomous aerial vehicles,Optimization,maritime communication networks (MCNs),Trajectory,marine communication,Signal to noise ratio,maritime communication networks,Q-learning,unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV),telecommunication control,discrete UAV trajectory design problem,"

"ais event-based knowledge discovery for maritime situational awareness","2016","The discovery of anomalies and, more in general, of events of interest at sea is one of the main challenges of Maritime Situational Awareness. This paper introduces an event-based methodology for knowledge discovery without querying directly a large volume of raw data. The proposed architecture analyses the maritime traffic data to detect maritime traffic patterns and events and aggregate them in an Event Map, namely a georeferenced grid. The Event Map offers visualisation capabilities and, more importantly, is used as access interface to the maritime traffic knowledge database. The proposed methodology offers real-time access to the extracted maritime knowledge, and the possibility to perform more structured queries with respect to traditional basic queries (e. g. vessel proximity within a certain distance). The proposed approach is demonstrated and assessed using real-world Automatic Identification System (AIS) data, revealing computational improvements and enriched monitoring capabilities.","data mining,event detection,anomaly detection,Marine vehicles,Monitoring,data visualisation,data visualisation capabilities,event map,AIS event-based knowledge discovery,maritime situational awareness,data analysis,anomaly discovery,automatic identification system,Knowledge discovery,marine engineering,AIS,maritime surveillance,maritime traffic data analysis,maritime traffic knowledge database,georeferenced grid,Data visualization,Trajectory,Visualization,knowledge discovery,"
"vertical profile of aerosol characteristics including activation over a rain shadow region in india","2021","Unique airborne observations of aerosol size spectral and chemical characteristics over the peninsular Indian region are illustrated in this case study. Multimodal lognormal distributions were required to fit the observed in situ aerosol size distribution. The aerosol composition and mixing state was deduced from the single-particle analyses of aerosols using the transmission electron microscope and soot photometer coupled with satellite retrieved aerosol classification, and back trajectory analyses. Organic carbon was the most prominent aerosol type found at all altitudes. Refractory black carbon aerosols which constituted about 10–12% of the aerosols in the boundary layer were primarily internally mixed with both inorganic and organic coating. Other major aerosol types were dust and sea salt, with the latter primarily found below 2 km. Further, the cloud forming ability of in-situ aerosols is tested through a cloud condensation nuclei closure analysis. The effective hygroscopicity decreased above cloud base due to the absence of sea salt aerosols. The change in large-scale winds with altitude affected the aerosol composition and hygroscopicity. The multimodal aerosol size distribution and hygroscopicity parameter (κ = 0.18) obtained for the cloud base aerosols over the rain shadow region are useful for studying aerosol-cloud interactions using regional cloud-resolving models.","CCN closure,CAIPEEX,Solapur,Lognormal distribution,Hygroscopicity parameter,"
"aerosols heat up the himalayan climate","2023","The impact of aerosols, especially the absorbing aerosols, in the Himalayan region is important for climate. We closely examine ground-based high-quality observations of aerosol characteristics including radiative forcing from several locations in the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP), the Himalayan foothills and the Tibetan Plateau, relatively poorly studied regions with several sensitive ecosystems of global importance, as well as highly vulnerable large populations. This paper presents a state-of-the-art treatment of the warming that arises from these particles, using a combination of new measurements and modeling techniques. This is a first-time analysis of its kind, including ground-based observations, satellite data, and model simulations, which reveals that the aerosol radiative forcing efficiency (ARFE) in the atmosphere is clearly high over the IGP and the Himalayan foothills (80–135 Wm−2 per unit aerosol optical depth (AOD)), with values being greater at higher elevations. AOD is >0.30 and single scattering albedo (SSA) is ∼0.90 throughout the year over this region. The mean ARFE is 2–4 times higher here than over other polluted sites in South and East Asia, owing to higher AOD and aerosol absorption (i.e., lower SSA). Further, the observed annual mean aerosol-induced atmospheric heating rates (0.5–0.8 Kelvin/day), which are significantly higher than previously reported values for the region, imply that the aerosols alone could account for >50 % of the total warming (aerosols + greenhouse gases) of the lower atmosphere and surface over this region. We demonstrate that the current state-of-the-art models used in climate assessments significantly underestimate aerosol-induced heating, efficiency and warming over the Hindu Kush – Himalaya – Tibetan Plateau (HKHTP) region, indicating a need for a more realistic representation of aerosol properties, especially of black carbon and other aerosols. The significant, regionally coherent aerosol-induced warming that we observe in the high altitudes of the region, is a significant factor contributing to increasing air temperature, observed accelerated retreat of the glaciers, and changes in the hydrological cycle and precipitation patterns over this region. Thus, aerosols are heating up the Himalayan climate, and will remain a key factor driving climate change over the region.","Himalayas,South Asia,Model simulations,Radiative effects,Atmospheric aerosols,Observations,"
"safeway: improving the safety of autonomous waypoint detection in maritime using transformer and interpolation","2023","Detecting waypoints where vessels change their behavior (i.e., maneuvers, speed changes, etc.) is essential for optimizing vessel trajectories to increase the efficiency and safety of sailing. However, accurately detecting waypoints is challenging due to potential AIS data quality issues (i.e., missing or inaccurate messages). In this paper, we propose a five-step learning approach (SafeWay) to estimate waypoints on a given AIS trajectory. First, we interpolate trajectories to tackle AIS data quality issues. Then, we annotate historical trajectories by using an existing waypoint library that contains historical waypoints. As the historical waypoints are passage plans manually created by port operators considering sailing conditions at that time, they are not specific to other historical trajectories between the same ports. We, therefore, use a similarity metric to determine overlapping segments of historical trajectories with the historical waypoints from the waypoint library. Then, we build a transformer model to capture vessel movement patterns based on speed- and location-related features. We do not process location features directly to avoid learning location-specific context, but take into account tailored delta features. We test our approach on a real-world AIS dataset collected from the Norwegian Sea between Å lesund and Måløy and show its effectiveness in terms of a harmonic mean of purity and coverage, mean absolute error and detection rate on the task of detecting trajectory waypoints compared to a state-of-the-art approach. We also show the effectiveness of the trained model on the trajectories obtained from two other regions, the North Sea (London and Rotterdam) and the North Atlantic Ocean (Setubal and Gibraltar), on which the model has not been trained. The experiments indicate that our interpolation-enabled transformer design provides improvements in the safety of the estimated waypoints.","Transformers,Maritime,Interpolation,Safety,Trajectory prediction,Vessel,Maneuver,Waypoint detection,Automatic identification system,AIS,"
"sources and sinks of perchlorate in soil in coastal ice-free areas of antarctica","2021","Perchlorate (ClO4−), a persistent inorganic compound, has harmful effects on human health. Natural ClO4− is formed in the atmosphere and enters into the surface environment through deposition. However, the knowledge on the occurrence, spatial variability and sinks of natural ClO4− in different environments remains limited, especially in the polar regions. Here, we investigate the sources and sinks of ClO4− in soil collected in three ice-free areas in coastal Antarctica, where the research stations and wildlife colonies are mainly distributed. No statistically significant difference in ClO4− concentrations between sites near and away from the stations suggests that local human presence is not a significant source of ClO4− in soil. Concentrations of ClO4− in soil from wildlife colonies are not significantly higher than those from sites with no intense wildlife activities, indicating that wildlife activities have no significant influences on ClO4− in soil. Thus, atmospherically formed ClO4− is the main source for soil in Antarctica. In general, ClO4− concentrations (0.1–5.1 μg kg−1) in soil in this study are much lower than those in the arid environments and comparable to those in the unsaturated zones. Leaching by snow meltwater may be the main sink for ClO4− in soil, and deeper depths for aqueous migration may contribute to the lower ClO4− concentrations in Antarctic surface soil compared to the values in the arid areas with low precipitation amount. Due to the biological origin of NO3−, no correlation between NO3− and ClO4− in soil is observed in this study, different from the observations in arid areas. In addition, no significant correlation is observed between organic matter contents and ClO4− concentrations in soil, suggesting that biological reduction is not an important sink for ClO4− in Antarctic soil.","Soil,Perchlorate,Atmospheric origin,Leaching,Antarctica,"

One example application is position data sharing between vessels within the maritime Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled context.

In this paper, we demonstrate the potential of using blockchain to facilitate privacy-preserving data sharing.

"multi-label classification for ais data anomaly detection using wavelet transform","2022","Thanks to the Automatic Identification System (AIS), ships and other maritime equipment are able to communicate with each other, for example, by sending information about their position. This solution allows for early collision detection when two or more ships are on a collision course. In the newer version of AIS, a satellite infrastructure is used to extend the communication range. Unfortunately, satellite AIS deals with so-called packet collision effect: since there is a problem with synchronizing AIS data coming from multiple terrestrial areas, a single satellite may receive several AIS messages at the same time and be unable to correctly process them, causing the data to get lost or garbled. In this article, a machine learning based framework for detecting the incorrect AIS data is presented. In this approach, after the first stage (clustering), a dedicated anomaly detection algorithm searches for damaged AIS messages and conducts multi-label classification (with Random Forest and wavelet transform) to decide which fields of such message requires further correction. The results of measuring the effectiveness of the proposed approach using real AIS data are presented.","telecommunication security,Clustering algorithms,incorrect AIS data,single satellite,Anomaly detection,Wavelet transforms,anomaly detection,random forests,collision course,Marine vehicles,Machine learning,damaged AIS messages,Data analysis,dedicated anomaly detection algorithm searches,satellite communication,ships,wavelet transform,pattern classification,random forest,Classification algorithms,multiple terrestrial areas,pattern clustering,machine learning based framework,Artificial intelligence,multi-label classification,multilabel classification,wavelet transforms,satellite infrastructure,AIS data anomaly detection,maritime equipment,communication range,Trajectory,marine communication,Labeling,early collision detection,AIS data analysis,packet collision effect,satellite AIS deals,"
"real-time tld target tracking algorithm based on improved kernel correlation filtering for maritime targets","2022","Aiming at the problem that the traditional KCF algorithm cannot adapt to the long-term target tracking in a complex offshore environment, TLD is a combination of track detection learning module tracking algorithms, which can carry out long-term target tracking, but its real-time performance needs to be improved. Based on the framework of the TLD target tracking algorithm, the tracking module adopts the improved multi-feature fusion and scale adaptive KCF algorithm, adaptive Kalman filter algorithm is used to predict the target position of the detection module, and the detection area is reduced. The detection speed of the algorithm is improved, and the detection results of occlusion detection and position estimation are used to modify the tracking results. In order to improve the accuracy of the tracker, an improved filtering template updating strategy is proposed. To improve the accuracy of the tracker, a new filtering template updating strategy is proposed. Then the accuracy and success rate of the proposed algorithm are verified on OTB50 dataset.

"a story about estimation of a random field of boulders from incomplete seismic measurements","2005","This paper reports on the statistical interpretation of seismic diffraction measurements of boulder locations. The measurements are made in a corridor along the planned tunnel line for the later realized bored tunnel through the till deposits under the East Channel of the Great Belt in Denmark. The investigation was made in 1987–1988 on the initiative of A/S Storebæltsforbindelsen in order to prepare its tendering for the bored tunnel. The purpose was to make a prediction of the density of boulders of maximal dimension above any specified length. The properties of the seismic measuring device and its graphical registrations on seismograms do not make a proper interpretation possible without detailed knowledge about the joint distribution of the primary dimensions of the boulders. Therefore, separate measurements were made of the dimensions of boulders deposited visibly on the cliff beaches of the Great Belt. The surprisingly simple results from the analysis of the data from this separate measuring program are reported in a companion paper. Based on the revealed geographical universality of the joint dimension distribution it is anticipated that the same distribution is applicable for the till deposits along the tunnel line. By use of this important distribution information and of the observed homogeneity of the seismic point source field together with the physical properties of diffraction it became possible to make the wanted prediction. During the excavation, the found boulders were counted and measured. These direct observations on site confirmed that the prediction was quite good.","Probabilistic models,Field investigations,Predictions,Statistical inference,Diffraction,Glacier till,Boulders,Tunnel boring,Seismic surveys,"

"plate tectonics and orogeny: a review","1976","Paleomagnetic pole positions, ocean-floor magnetic anomalies and least-squares fits of continental edges show that most Phanerozoic orogenic belts have formed at or near the borders of continents and island arcs. Large areas of old ocean floor have vanished, probably along former continental margins and islands arcs. Thus most Phanerozoic orogenic belts must include subduction zone effects. Superposed on them may be effects caused by self-heating of thick ‘geosynclinal’ piles of continental margin sediment. It is not yet clear how to discriminate self-heating from slip-zone heating effects. Paleomagnetic data also show that rigid areas of the continental crust have been in relative motion for at least 2500 m.y. These data imply that plates existed and that subduction may have been active since at least the beginning of Proterozoic time. Paleomagnetic data and mapping suggest that some Proterozoic African orogenic belts may not have originated by plate-tectonic processes, though the evidence is inconclusive. There is no geophysical evidence for or against the existence of Archean plates. The causes of Archean orogenesis are speculative. Some plate-tectonic models appear to differ significantly from the actual orogenic belts they purport to describe. In particular, long-continued subduction does not necessarily give rise to continental accretion, but in some cases may actually involve tectonic erosion of the overriding plate by the slip zone. Subduction of continental crust is likely to have taken place in the Alps and probably in many other orogenic belts. Probable continental margin sequences of pre-Mesozoic age are common. Some of these could have been deposited along Atlantic-type continental margins, but in no case has the matching continental fragment been identified. Without such identification, Atlantic-type continental margin sequences cannot be readily distinguished from sequences formed at the borders of new ocean basins next to wide, migrating, active island arcs (‘marginal basins’). Additional evidence suggests that the Cambro-Ordovician sequences of northwest Scotland cannot be deposits formed on an Atlantic-type continental margin, and that the same sequence in northwest Newfoundland may not have formed along such a margin. The plate tectonic significance of most orogenic features is unknown or controversial. How andesites originate is not understood; the reasons for the systematic potash variations with depth to the slip zone in andesite suites are unknown; and the significance of foreland deformation, of slaty cleavage and of regional metamorphism are disputed. Nevertheless, the solutions to all of the above problems are considered attainable, but will require a constant interplay between field, laboratory and theoretical work.",""
"gross and microscopic pathology of lesions in pocillopora spp. from the subtropical eastern pacific","2014","Coral reefs are threatened by a variety of factors including diseases that have caused significant damage in some regions such as in the Caribbean. At present, no data are available on coral diseases in the Mexican Pacific where Pocillopora spp. is a dominant component of coral communities. Here, we describe gross and microscopic morphology of lesions found in pocilloporids at four sites in the Mexican Pacific. Corals were identified and their lesions photographed and quantified in the field. Tissue samples were collected from healthy and affected colonies for histopathology. We recorded seven species of pocilloporids at the study sites with Isla Isabel being the location with the highest coral diversity (H′=1.27). Lesions were present in 42% of the colonies and included discoloration (32%), predation-induced tissue loss (30%), unexplained tissue loss (3%) and overgrowth by sponges or algae (35%). The most affected species, P. damicornis (50%), was also one of the most common in the region. No species was more prone to a particular lesion, but there was a significant association between location and the presence of lesions. Northern Islas Marietas (61%) and Isla Isabel (41%) had the highest prevalence of lesions, followed by Manzanillo (37%) and Bahías de Huatulco (23%). Histological changes included atrophy of the surface body wall with depletion of zooxanthellae (91%) in corals with discoloration (bleaching). Ablation of tissue from mesoglea (18%) was also observed. Colonies with unexplained tissue loss showed atrophy and thinning of the epidermis (89%), characterized by cuboidal instead of pseudocolumnar cells normally found in healthy pseudocolumnar ciliated epithelium. Bacterial aggregates between the mesoglea and gastrodermis (11%) were very conspicuous in healthy and diseased corals. Lesions produced by fish bites and gastropods were associated with tissue atrophy (40%) and, in some cases, algal overgrowth near the lesion (20%). No infectious agents associated with cell pathology were detected microscopically. Bleaching and overgrowth by algae and sponges, as well as unexplained tissue loss, are common in Pocillopora. These lesions and anatomical changes warrant further study since their incidence is potentially indicative of reef degradation.","Histopathology,Eastern Pacific,Lesions,Coral diseases,"
"26 - applications of ai and possibilities for process control","2022","Multiphase flows occur in the oil and gas industries, e.g., gas/oil/water/sand (g/o/w/s) in all possible combinations, drilling mud with cuttings and g/o/w/s, in the storage and transport of wet or dry particulates, e.g., fluidized beds, slurries and sedimentation, e.g., as in dredging, in the nuclear power industries, e.g., entrained air, and steam at supercritical temperatures in cooling water in pressurized water reactors. Most of these processes have different flow regimes with varying distributions of the different materials/phases, flowing at different speeds and spread over the cross-section of the conduit supporting the flow, an important topic in CFD studies and software development. These processes are monitored with a plethora of sensors, continuously gathering vast amount of valuable data from various locations with many control loops distributed in the processes with a dedicated overall process control using different strategies, which recently have AI and machine learning techniques in their portfolio. The data from the sensors are valuable in data fusion not only for deterministic mechanistic modeling but also for exploratory data analysis (EDA), a growing branch of AI-based industrial machine learning. Data from process tomography/tomometry using nonintrusive and noninvasive sensing provide big data in real time, useful in identifying various flow phenomena, such as flow regimes, tunneling flow in silos, infiltration of sand in pipes, unusually high presence of gas bubbles in cooling water, etc. In this chapter, some applications of ECT and EIT in the above three process industries are presented. This chapter focuses on the sensor arrays and protocols used along with excitation and sensing methods used in the ECT/EIT modules and then presents some results from EDA as applied in the growing field of industrial machine learning.

"impact of past mining activities on water quality in a karst area in the cévennes region, southern france","2023","Sampling and analysis of groundwater and surface water were conducted to assess the potential impacts of abandoned mines on water quality in a karst area in Southern France. The results of multivariate statistical analysis and geochemical mapping revealed that water quality is affected by contaminated drainage from abandoned mine sites. Acid mine drainage with very high concentrations of Fe, Mn, Al, Pb and Zn was identified in a few samples collected from mine openings and near waste dumps. In general, neutral drainage with elevated concentrations of Fe, Mn, Zn, As, Ni and Cd was observed due to buffering by carbonate dissolution. The contamination is spatially limited around abandoned mine sites, suggesting that metal(oid)s are sequestered in secondary phases that form under near-neutral and oxidizing conditions. However, the analysis of seasonal variations in trace metal concentrations showed that the transport of metal contaminants in water is highly variable according to hydrological conditions. During low flow conditions, trace metals are likely to be rapidly sequestered in Fe-oxyhydroxides and carbonate minerals in the karst aquifer and the river sediments, while low or no surface runoff in intermittent rivers limits the transport of contaminants in the environment. On the other hand, significant amounts of metal(loid)s can be transported under high flow conditions, primarily in dissolved form. Dissolved metal(loid) concentrations in groundwater remained elevated despite dilution by uncontaminated water, likely as a result of the increased leaching of mine wastes and the flushing of contaminated waters from mine workings. This work shows that groundwater is the main source of contamination to the environment and highlights the need to better understand the fate of trace metals in karst water systems.","Compositional data analysis,Seasonal variations,Groundwater,Trace metals,Croix-de-Pallières,Mine drainage,"

"an enhanced dv-hop positioning scheme based on spring model and reliable beacon node set","2022","How to get the node position, as a hotter topic in the field of wireless communication, is the primary problem to be solved in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). The DV-Hop positioning scheme is a kind of range-free positioning scheme, which has been favored by researchers in recent years. However, the original DV-Hop scheme faces the shortcoming of low positioning precision and stability. To ameliorate the positioning capability of the DV-Hop, an enhanced DV-Hop scheme based on the spring model and reliable beacon node set has been presented in this paper. Firstly, the relationship between nodes in the network is abstracted as a spring model, and the distance between unknown nodes and beacon nodes is corrected by comprehensively considering the influence of each beacon node from the physical phenomenon of force vector decomposition. After that, based on the random sample consensus (RANSAC) algorithm, the reliable beacon nodes with smaller distance deviation to the unknown node are picked out to compute the unknown node coordinates, rather than all beacon nodes participating in the calculation. Finally, extensive experiments have been conducted on distance accuracy and positioning performance. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed positioning scheme outperforms better than original DV-Hop and other existing improved schemes under different scenarios.","Positioning accuracy,RANSAC algorithm,Distance precision,DV-Hop scheme,WSN,"

"evapotranspiration and energy balance of native wet montane cloud forest in hawai‘i","2009","Evapotranspiration (ET) and energy balance were observed, using eddy covariance and other micrometeorological measurements, at a native Metrosideros polymorpha forest site in Hawai‘i. Total rainfall for the 12-month study period (2401mm) was close to the long-term mean (2500mmyear−1), but was highly variable from month to month with distinct dry periods in February, May, and December 2005. Measured annual ET of 996mmyear−1 was slightly higher than previous estimates for similar locations in Hawai‘i. However, the energy closure ratio was 0.784, leading us to adjust turbulent energy fluxes upward by 27.6%. The resulting adjusted annual ET of 1232mm is significantly higher than previous forest ET estimates for Hawai‘i. Variations in canopy conductivity suggest that midday stomatal closure is occurring and/or that evaporation is high in the morning because of frequent wet canopy conditions early in the day. The daily fraction of turbulent energy flux used for ET was observed to be lower for days with high net radiation, indicating that transpiration is being limited under conditions of high evaporative demand. ET was generally higher during rainy periods than dry periods. After controlling for differences in available energy, ET is, on average, 29% higher on days with rain than days without rain. The fraction of energy used for ET follows a distinct annual pattern, roughly corresponding to the observed cycle in leaf area at the site, with a minimum in mid-April and a maximum in mid-October. Variations in rainfall appear to be the cause of deviations from the annual cycle of the fraction of energy used for ET. This suggests that ET is strongly controlled by variations in canopy wetness at this wet forest site.","Forest hydrology,Hawai‘i Volcanoes National Park,Tropical montane cloud forests,Evapotranspiration,Throughfall,Energy balance,"
"a wavelet-based deep learning pipeline for efficient covid-19 diagnosis via ct slices","2022","The quick diagnosis of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) disease is vital to prevent its propagation and improve therapeutic outcomes. Computed tomography (CT) is believed to be an effective tool for diagnosing COVID-19, however, the CT scan contains hundreds of slices that are complex to be analyzed and could cause delays in diagnosis. Artificial intelligence (AI) especially deep learning (DL), could facilitate and speed up COVID-19 diagnosis from such scans. Several studies employed DL approaches based on 2D CT images from a single view, nevertheless, 3D multiview CT slices demonstrated an excellent ability to enhance the efficiency of COVID-19 diagnosis. The majority of DL-based studies utilized the spatial information of the original CT images to train their models, though, using spectral–temporal information could improve the detection of COVID-19. This article proposes a DL-based pipeline called CoviWavNet for the automatic diagnosis of COVID-19. CoviWavNet uses a 3D multiview dataset called OMNIAHCOV. Initially, it analyzes the CT slices using multilevel discrete wavelet decomposition (DWT) and then uses the heatmaps of the approximation levels to train three ResNet CNN models. These ResNets use the spectral–temporal information of such images to perform classification. Subsequently, it investigates whether the combination of spatial information with spectral–temporal information could improve the diagnostic accuracy of COVID-19. For this purpose, it extracts deep spectral–temporal features from such ResNets using transfer learning and integrates them with deep spatial features extracted from the same ResNets trained with the original CT slices. Then, it utilizes a feature selection step to reduce the dimension of such integrated features and use them as inputs to three support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. To further validate the performance of CoviWavNet, a publicly available benchmark dataset called SARS-COV-2-CT-Scan is employed. The results of CoviWavNet have demonstrated that using the spectral–temporal information of the DWT heatmap images to train the ResNets is superior to utilizing the spatial information of the original CT images. Furthermore, integrating deep spectral–temporal features with deep spatial features has enhanced the classification accuracy of the three SVM classifiers reaching a final accuracy of 99.33% and 99.7% for the OMNIAHCOV and SARS-COV-2-CT-Scan datasets respectively. These accuracies verify the outstanding performance of CoviWavNet compared to other related studies. Thus, CoviWavNet can help radiologists in the rapid and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 diagnosis.","Convolutional neural networks,Discrete wavelet transform (DWT),Deep learning,Computed tomography (CT),COVID-19,ResNet,"

This papers proposes a distributed adaptive time slot allocation (DATSA) scheme for WiMAX mesh MAC protocol. DATSA is a distributed scheme that allocates time slots robustly by taking into consideration difference between radio reception range and interference range, and latency in scheduling control messages. DATSA has a method to monitor reception quality of an allocated time slot, in order to detect the effect of topology changes due to ship mobility, etc. Based on the monitoring outcome, the method adaptively changes the time slot allocation if necessary. We have evaluated DATSA through random event simulation using QualNet. The simulation results confirm that DATSA outperforms the original WiMAX mesh MAC protocol that has no adaptive time slot allocation, in terms of throughput, average packet delay, and packet delivery ratio.","WiMAX mesh MAC protocol,terrestrial wireless broadband network,Robust control,Wireless mesh networks,Marine vehicles,Monitoring,distributed adaptive time slot allocation,radio reception range,IP networks,interference range,maritime wireless mesh network,ship mobility,access protocols,telecommunication network topology,Delay effects,Media Access Protocol,Broadband communication,radiofrequency interference,broadband networks,radio reception,marine communication,WiMAX,Interference,Internet,WiMax,"
