"online detection of anomaly behaviors based on multidimensional trajectories","2020","In the surveillance domain, timely detection of anomaly behaviors is very important and is a great challenge to human operators due to information overload, fatigue and inattention. Many anomaly detection algorithms based on trajectories have been proposed for this problem. However, these algorithms generally have problems such as complex parameter setting, unfaithful statistical model, not well-calibrated false alarm rate, poor ability of online learning and sequential anomaly detection, etc. The theory of conformal prediction was introduced to solve these problems by constructing the sequential Hausdorff nearest neighbor conformal anomaly detector. Yet, it only considers position information of the targets and is not sensitive to velocity and course anomaly behaviors. And the run times are increasing as the increase of the data size, which is not appropriate for early warning surveillance application. In order to solve these problems, sequential multi-factor Hausdorff nearest neighbor conformal anomaly detector (SMFHNNCAD) and sequential multi-factor Hausdorff nearest neighbor inductive conformal anomaly detector (SMFHNNICAD) based on multidimensional trajectories are proposed in this paper. Experiments in both simulated military scenario and realistic civilian scenario show the presented algorithm has a good performance to online detect anomaly behaviors and would have a wide prospect in early warning surveillance systems.","Multidimensional,Anomaly behavior,Trajectory,Online detection,"
"development of a time series imaging approach for fault classification of marine systems","2022","As part of any Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) system for the shipping industry, the determination of the current health of marine systems is fundamental. As such, diagnostic analytics is performed; a process that is typically constituted by fault detection, fault isolation, and fault identification. Although some efforts have been made to distinguish the faults and malfunctions (fault detection) that can occur in marine systems, the implementation of fault identification to provide a description of any considered fault type and its nature is still an unexplored area due to the lack of fault data. To overcome this, a methodology for the identification of anomalies in marine systems is presented in this paper. The proposed approach aims to analyse the implementation of time series imaging through the application of the first-order Markov chain in tandem with an analysis of both ResNet50V2 and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) as part of the image classification task. To highlight the performance of this methodology, anomalies have been simulated considering the power parameter of a diesel generator. Results demonstrated the potential of time series imaging and image classification approaches, as the Markov-CNN achieved an accuracy of 95% when performing the fault classification task.","Anomaly identification,Time series imaging,Marine systems,Fault diagnosis,Prognostics and health management (PHM),Fault classification,Shipping industry,"
"anomaly based sea-surface small target detection using k-nearest neighbor classification","2020","Sea-surface small target detection is always a difficult problem in high-resolution maritime ubiquitous radars for complex characteristics of sea clutter, weak target returns, and diversity of targets. Multiple features extracted from radar returns in different domains have ability but not enough to solely distinguish radar returns with target from sea clutter. Joint exploitation of multiple features becomes the key to improve detection performance. In this article, the K-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm and anomaly detection idea are cooperated to develop a novel sea-surface target detection method in the feature space spanned by the eight existing salient features. The detection is realized by the anomaly detection followed by a specially designed KNN-based classifier with a controllable false alarm rate. In the anomaly detection, a decision region is determined by the hyper-spherical coverage of the training set of sea clutter that is sufficient and ergodic in the feature space. The KNN-based classifier is designed based on the training sample set of sea clutter and the training sample set of simulated target returns plus sea clutter that is sufficient but nonergodic, by joint usage of feature weighting, neighbor weighting, and distance weighting. The novel method is validated by the two open and recognized IPIX and CSIR radar databases for sea-surface small target detection. The results show that it provides significant performance improvement in comparison with the existing multiple-feature-based detection methods, owing to the fact that the novel method avoids the dimension restriction and feature compression loss in the existing methods.","k-nearest neighbor algorithm,feature compression loss,IPIX radar databases,marine radar,high-resolution maritime ubiquitous radars,Anomaly detection,radar detection,radar clutter,KNN-based classifier design,anomaly based sea-surface,neighbor algorithm,Feature extraction,sea clutter,radar computing,anomaly detection idea,object detection,feature extraction,CSIR radar databases,weak target return simulation,K-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier with controllable false alarm rate,Radar clutter,feature weighting space,nearest neighbour methods,Training,sea-surface small target detection,Clutter,sea-surface target detection method,Object detection,Anomaly detection framework,multiple-feature-based detection methods,training sample set,Radar detection,"

"on the effectiveness of ai-assisted anomaly detection methods in maritime navigation","2020","The automatic identification system (AIS) has become an essential tool for maritime security. Nevertheless, how to effectively use the static and dynamic voyage information of the AIS data in maritime traffic situation awareness is still a challenge. This paper presents a comparative study of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques on their effectiveness in dealing with various anomalies in maritime domain using the AIS data. The AIS on-off switching (OOS) anomaly is critical in maritime security, since AIS technology is susceptible to manipulation and it can be switched on and off to hide illegal activities. Thus, we try to detect and distinguish between intentional and non-intentional AIS OOS anomalies through our AI -assisted anomaly detection framework. We use AIS data, in particular positional and navigational status of vessels, to study the effectiveness of seven AI techniques, such as artificial neural network, support vector machine, logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, decision tree, random forest and naive Bayes, in detecting the AIS OOS anomalies. Our experimental results show that ANN and SVM are the most suitable techniques in detecting the AIS OOS anomalies with 99.9% accuracy. Interestingly, the ANN model outperforms others when trained with a balanced (i.e., same order of samples per class) dataset, and SVM, on the other hand, is suitable when training dataset is unbalanced.","maritime traffic situation awareness,AI-assisted anomaly detection,decision trees,Support vector machines,logistic regression,Anomaly detection,static voyage information,random forests,ANN,marine navigation,Feature extraction,security of data,maritime security,k-nearest neighbors,regression analysis,AIS technology,naive Bayes,neural nets,naive Bayes methods,automatic identification system,marine safety,marine engineering,support vector machines,maritime navigation,dynamic voyage information,maritime domain,random forest,SVM,Artificial intelligence,AIS on-off switching anomaly,nearest neighbour methods,artificial neural network,Training,Trajectory,support vector machine,nonintentional AIS OOS anomalies,Navigation,artificial intelligence,decision tree,AIS data,"
"a novel approach exploiting properties of convolutional neural networks for vessel movement anomaly detection and classification","2022","The article concerns the automation of vessel movement anomaly detection for maritime and coastal traffic safety services. Deep Learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), were used to solve this problem. Three variants of the datasets, containing samples of vessel traffic routes in relation to the prohibited area in the form of a grayscale image, were generated. 1458 convolutional neural networks with different structures were trained to find the best structure to classify anomalies. The influence of various parameters of network structures on the overall accuracy of classification was examined. For the best networks, class prediction rates were examined. Activations of selected convolutional layers were studied and visualized to present how the network works in a friendly and understandable way.

"research on ship abnormal behavior detection method based on graph neural network","2022","Because of the existing maritime intelligent supervision, ship abnormal behavior detection ignores the interdependence between different time series of ships and different abnormal behavior characteristics, which leads to poor real-time performance and limited detection accuracy of abnormal detection. This paper explores the mechanism of ship abnormal behavior monitoring and detection based on graph attention network. This mechanism uses a sliding window to generate fixed data input, uses graph attention network to capture the dependence between ship behavior characteristics, and determines the threshold of anomaly according to the sea environment set in this paper.

"neural network-based automatic reconstruction of missing vessel trajectory data","2019","Automatic identification system (AIS) is an independent tracking system which has been widely utilized on ships to frequently broadcast the time-stamped vessel position reports. The generated massive AIS data can contribute to protecting maritime security and enhancing maritime transportation efficiency, such as maritime surveillance, anomaly detection and traffic route extraction, etc. However, the received AIS-based vessel trajectories commonly suffer from missing data due to network overload and bad weathers. To improve the quality of vessel trajectories for further researches, a two-step calculation method for vessel trajectory reconstruction is proposed in this work. In particular, the Random Forest method is introduced in the first step to automatically identify the missing position records within vessel trajectories. The missing data points could be accurately estimated from both theoretical and practical perspectives. The second step proposes a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based supervised learning method to reconstruct the vessel trajectories with missing AIS data. The LSTM-based reconstruction method is able to take full advantage of the similar geometrical features behind massive vessel trajectories. Experimental results have confirmed the superior performance of the proposed two-step method in terms of both effectiveness and robustness.","two-step calculation method,surveillance,missing position records,massive AIS data,LSTM-based reconstruction method,random forests,anomaly detection,transportation,Marine vehicles,trajectory reconstruction,maritime security,Random Forest method,long short-term memory-based supervised learning method,network overload,Radio frequency,Decision trees,neural nets,neural network-based automatic reconstruction,vessel trajectory data,ships,automatic identification system,marine safety,marine engineering,maritime surveillance,AIS-based vessel trajectories,trajectory data mining,time-stamped vessel position reports,Logic gates,massive vessel trajectories,Automatic identification system,missing AIS data,Trajectory,traffic route extraction,missing data points,vessel trajectory reconstruction,two-step method,independent tracking system,long short-term memory,maritime transportation efficiency,learning (artificial intelligence),tracking,bad weathers,"
"a novel model for ship trajectory anomaly detection based on gaussian mixture variational autoencoder","2023","The use of traditional methods in anomaly detection of multi-class ship trajectories showed some limitations in terms of robustness and learning ability of trajectory features. In view of this, an anomaly detection model for ship trajectory data based on Gaussian Mixture Variational Autoencoder (GMVAE) is proposed in this study using an unsupervised classification method. The proposed model modifies Variational Autoencoder (VAE) by changing the inferential distribution of prior distribution and approximate posterior to the Gaussian mixture model. A high-dimensional hidden space is constructed to learn the features of multi-class trajectory data, and the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) method is applied to measure the error between the reconstructed trajectory and the original trajectory in order to judge whether the ship trajectory is abnormal. The Automatic Identification System (AIS) data from the US coastal areas are used to verify the proposed model, and the results are compared with other commonly used models in a manually labeled dataset. The research results indicate that the detection rate of the proposed model is 91.26%, and the false alarm rate is 0.68%, which performs the best. Using the Gaussian mixture model to describe the distribution of hidden space can improve the learning ability of multi-class trajectories of VAE, thus increasing the robustness of the model. This research can provide technical support for ship trajectory data analysis and risk management of maritime transportation.","Trajectory,anomaly detection of ship trajectory,Clustering algorithms,Classification algorithms,Mathematical models,gaussian mixture variational autoencoder (gmvae),unsupervised learning,Gaussian distribution,Marine vehicles,Artificial neural networks,intelligent transportation,AIS,"
"a cloud based architecture capable of perceiving and predicting multiple vessel behaviour","2015","Progressively huge amounts of data, tracking vessels during their voyages across the seas, are becoming available, mostly due to the automatic identification system (AIS) that vessels of specific categories are required to carry. These datasets provide detailed insights into the patterns vessels follow, while safely navigating across the globe, under various conditions. In this paper, we develop an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) capable of predicting a vessels future behaviour (position, speed and course), based on events that occur in a predictable pattern, across large map areas. The main concept of this study is to determine if an ANN is capable of inferring the unique behavioural patterns that each vessel follows and successively use this as a means for predicting multiple vessel behaviour into a future point in time. We design, train and implement a proof of concept ANN, as a cloud based web application, with the ability of overlaying predicted short and long term vessel behaviour on an interactive map.

"magnetic anomaly detection of adjacent parallel pipelines using deep learning neural networks","2022","Magnetic anomaly detection is becoming increasingly prevalent for detecting and locating the buried pipelines. The detection performance is often hindered by adjacent pipeline, near-field ferromagnetic objects and random noises. In order to overcome these obstacles, a magnetic anomaly detection method based on deep learning neural networks (DLNN) is proposed to decouple and denoise the integrated detection to accurately extract the magnetic anomaly of single pipeline. The theoretical derivation of the vertical component of magnetic anomaly was executed based on Poisson's equation. Then the integrated detection was simulated by summing magnetic anomalies of parallel pipelines and metal sphere, as well as white Gaussian noise. The DLNN was constructed with improved optimization design, and trained using supervised learning method. The results show that the proposed method exhibits almost immune to random noises, the prediction accuracy approaches to 90% with signal to noise ratio (SNR) of 30 dB. Meanwhile, the predictive accuracy is still above 80% with interferences both from near-field ferromagnetic objects and random noises with SNR of 30 dB. The method becomes practically significant in the development of geomagnetic inspection instruments for the adjacent parallel pipelines.","Magnetic anomaly detection,Neural networks,Deep learning,Adjacent parallel pipelines,"
"design of a decision support system to achieve condition-based maintenance in ship machinery systems","2023","A decision support system is proposed for the condition-based maintenance of ship machinery systems based on the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) approach. A case study is conducted for a container ship's main diesel engine. Within the scope of the methodology, the main engine power is predicted based on exhaust gas outlet temperatures of cylinders and the main engine shaft RPM. In this regard, firstly, two different strategies such as the creation of the cylinder-basis model and the development of the overall system model are developed to determine the ANFIS model structure for the analysis. Then, comparative analyses are carried out to select a suitable ANFIS structure and its specific membership functions. In addition, the estimation process is also performed by the artificial neural network (ANN) model, and its results are compared with the findings of the best ANFIS structure. The success of the constructed models is evaluated by some error metrics. The overall ANFIS model with 5 membership functions is determined as the best approach by scores of 0.9806 for R2, 1.6588 MW for RMSE, and 3.2703 for MAPE. As a result of the estimation procedure, a decision support system to assist marine operators in maintenance operations is developed. The proposed strategy can be applied to different types of systems in the ship engine room such as the fuel oil system and can be improved by including more parameters obtained from the system's significant points in the analysis.","Anomaly detection,Ship machinery system,ANN,Condition-based maintenance,Maintenance,ANFIS,"
"relating anomalous large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns to temperature and precipitation anomalies in the east asian monsoon region","2020","The anomalous large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns concerned with surface air temperature and precipitation anomalies within East Asian Monsoon region for winter and summer months from 1979 to 2017 are analyzed by employing the self-organizing map (SOM) neural network. The asymmetric 3 × 4 SOM neural network is firstly constructed with the geopotential height anomalies at 500-hPa level as the only input variable. Then 12 characteristic anomalous large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns (nodes) are identified. The composites of temperature and precipitation anomalies as well as vertical wind anomalies at 500-hPa level assigned to each node are generated and visualized. The spatial distributions of anomalous geopotential height (anticyclones or cyclones) are highly consistent with that of surface air temperature anomalies in both winter and summer. Most precipitation extremes in winter are attributed to the joint effect of the horizontal and vertical atmospheric motions, while strong air convection is prone to inducing extreme precipitation events in summer. Based on the SOM classification, the differences of atmospheric circulations, temperature and precipitation anomalies have also been partly identified in strong and weak phases of East Asia Monsoon.","Temperature and precipitation anomalies,Self-organizing map,East Asian Monsoon,Atmospheric circulation patterns,"
"fast and parameter-light rare behavior detection in maritime trajectories","2020","Rare behaviors indicate important events and situations in maritime surveillance applications. State-of-the-art methods provide many effective solutions to detect anomalous behaviors. Meanwhile, most solutions are parameter-laden and too costly to identify useful rare behaviors with human knowledge in a visual analytics manner. This paper is concerned with a scheme cross trajectories, vessel attributes and the movement context for detecting rare behaviors through preprocessing, kNN-based clustering, and verification. Although the scheme involves several parameters, we demonstrate that they are able to be tackled in thresholds. As a result, a rare behavior factor is the single parameter that affect the detecting results. The proposed scheme is evaluated via a simulated data set for performance and a real life AIS data for effectiveness. Results show that high accuracy to labelled anomalies and useful rare behaviors can be achieved.","Rare behaviour detection,Trajectory,Visual analytics,"
"a contextual hybrid model for vessel movement prediction","2021","Predicting the movement of the vessels can significantly improve the management of safety. While the movement can be a function of geographic contexts, the current systems and methods rarely incorporate contextual information into the analysis. This paper initially proposes a novel context-aware trajectoriesâ€™ simplification method to embed the effects of geographic context which guarantees the logical consistency of the compressed trajectories, and further suggests a hybrid method that is built upon a curvilinear model and deep neural networks. The proposed method employs contextual information to check the logical consistency of the curvilinear method and then, constructs a Context-aware Long Short-Term Memory (CLSTM) network that can take into account contextual variables, such as the vessel types. The proposed method can enhance the prediction accuracy while maintaining the logical consistency, through a recursive feedback loop. The implementations of the proposed approach on the Automatic Identification System (AIS) dataset, from the eastern coast of the United States of America which was collected, from November to December 2017, demonstrates the effectiveness and better compression, i.e. 80% compression ratio while maintaining the logical consistency. The estimated compressed trajectories are 23% more similar to their original trajectories compared to currently used simplification methods.

The proposed model consists of an encoder-decoder-based RE-DFP network to improve positioning accuracy and data efficiency and a RAD network to analyze environmental dynamics according to APs. In the proposed RE-DFP, a CNN-based encoder is applied to increase efficiency by minimizing the dependence of the radio map, and the position is estimated through an LSTM-based decoder. RAD identifies the AP, which is the cause of the change in the radio map and excludes it from the online phase, preventing a decrease in positioning accuracy. Simultaneously, the proposed model collects the RSSI of the identified AP through crowdsourcing and reconstructs the radio map by itself, enabling a seamless positioning service in the online phase.","Radio map,RE-DFP,Indoor positioning system,Fingerprinting,RAD,"

"fault detection with lstm-based variational autoencoder for maritime components","2021","Maintenance routines on ships today follow either a reactive maintenance (RM) or preventive maintenance (PvM) approach. RM can be regarded as post-failure repair, which might create large costs. PvM uses predetermined maintenance intervals, which often involves unnecessary maintenance.

Experiments on a real AIS dataset comprising more than 4.2 million AIS messages demonstrate the relevance of the proposed method compared with state-of-the-art schemes.","heterogeneous patterns,motion estimation,GeoTrackNet,naval engineering computing,Anomaly detection,Geospatial analysis,anomaly detection,probabilistic representation,variational recurrent neural networks,AIS messages,maritime traffic patterns,maritime anomaly detector,AIS dataset,maritime situational awareness,neural nets,probabilistic neural network representation,deep learning,ships,marine engineering,AIS data streams,complex patterns,contrario detection,AIS,maritime surveillance,object detection,Probabilistic logic,a contrario detection,Artificial intelligence,maritime anomaly detection,Trajectory,Task analysis,vessel monitoring,contrario detector,learning (artificial intelligence),state-of-the-art neural network schemes,Detectors,AIS tracks,"

"neighborhood rough residual networkâ€“based outlier detection method in iot-enabled maritime transportation systems","2023","Outlier detection can identify anomalies in large-scale data. To provide reliability and security for Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled maritime transportation systems (MTSs), in this paper we propose an outlier detection method based on the neighborhood rough residual network (NRRN). We calculate the neighborhood approximation accuracy and neighborhood conditional entropy to obtain the neighborhood combined entropy describing the discrimination ability of the condition attribute subset to the information system. We then delete the redundant attributes according to the attribute combination importance derived from the neighborhood combined entropy. The data after attribute reduction are used to train the convolutional neural network, and the residual network (ResNet50) is used to avoid the degradation of model performance caused by the increase in the number of network layers. The proposed method is compared with mainstream outlier detection algorithms on a fishing vessel operation dataset. Experiments show that the proposed method can greatly improve the accuracy of outlier detection while taking into account interpretability and computational efficiency, thereby ensuring the data integrity of IoT-enabled MTSs.","Outlier detection,Data models,residual network,neighborhood combined entropy,Transportation,Entropy,data integrity,Anomaly detection,Behavioral sciences,Marine vehicles,Residual neural networks,IoT-enabled maritime transportation systems,"

"spectral anomaly methods for aerial detection using kut nuisance rejection","2015","This work discusses the application and optimization of a spectral anomaly method for the real-time detection of gamma radiation sources from an aerial helicopter platform. Aerial detection presents several key challenges over ground-based detection. For one, larger and more rapid background fluctuations are typical due to higher speeds, larger field of view, and geographically induced background changes. As well, the possible large altitude or stand-off distance variations cause significant steps in background count rate as well as spectral changes due to increased gamma-ray scatter with detection at higher altitudes. The work here details the adaptation and optimization of the PNNL-developed algorithm Nuisance-Rejecting Spectral Comparison Ratios for Anomaly Detection (NSCRAD), a spectral anomaly method previously developed for ground-based applications, for an aerial platform. The algorithm has been optimized for two multi-detector systems; a NaI(Tl)-detector-based system and a CsI detector array. The optimization here details the adaptation of the spectral windows for a particular set of target sources to aerial detection and the tailoring for the specific detectors. As well, the methodology and results for background rejection methods optimized for the aerial gamma-ray detection using Potassium, Uranium and Thorium (KUT) nuisance rejection are shown. Results indicate that use of a realistic KUT nuisance rejection may eliminate metric rises due to background magnitude and spectral steps encountered in aerial detection due to altitude changes and geographically induced steps such as at land–water interfaces.","Aerial detection,Radiation detection,KUT nuisance rejection,Spectral anomaly detection,Aerial search,"
"leveraging graph and deep learning uncertainties to detect anomalous maritime trajectories","2022","Understanding and representing traffic patterns are key to detecting anomalous trajectories in the transportation domain. However, some trajectories can exhibit heterogeneous maneuvering characteristics despite confining to normal patterns. Thus, we propose a novel graph-based trajectory representation and association scheme for extraction and confederation of traffic movement patterns, such that data patterns and uncertainty can be learned by deep learning (DL) models. This paper proposes the usage of a recurrent neural network (RNN)-based evidential regression model, which can predict trajectory at future timesteps as well as estimate the data and model uncertainties associated, to detect anomalous maritime trajectories, such as unusual vessel maneuvering, using automatic identification system (AIS) data. Furthermore, we utilize evidential deep learning classifiers to detect unusual turns of vessels and the loss of transmitted signal using predicted class probabilities with associated uncertainties. Our experimental results suggest that the graphical representation of traffic patterns improves the ability of the DL models, such as evidential and Monte Carlo dropout, to learn the temporal-spatial correlation of data and associated uncertainties. Using different datasets and experiments, we demonstrate that the estimated prediction uncertainty yields fundamental information for the detection of traffic anomalies in the maritime and, possibly in other domains.","Monte Carlo methods,classification,recurrent neural nets,graph,deep learning (artificial intelligence),Anomaly detection,DL models,graph-based trajectory representation,automatic identification system data,Monte Carlo dropout,graphical representation,traffic movement patterns,detect anomalous maritime trajectories,Predictive models,regression analysis,evidential deep learning,marine engineering,Data models,data patterns,pattern classification,Artificial intelligence,graph theory,RNN,regression,clustering,uncertainty,Trajectory,Uncertainty,probability,Computational modeling,traffic engineering computing,recurrent neural network-based evidential regression model,deep learning uncertainties,AIS data,"

"chapter 4 - anomaly detection","2014","This chapter presents an extension of conformal prediction for anomaly detection applications. It includes the presentation and discussion of the Conformal Anomaly Detector (CAD) and the computationally more efficient Inductive Conformal Anomaly Detector (ICAD), which are general algorithms for unsupervised or semi-supervised and offline or online anomaly detection. One of the key properties of CAD and ICAD is that the rate of detected anomalies is well calibrated in the online setting under the randomness assumption. Similar to conformal prediction, the choice of Nonconformity Measure (NCM) is of central importance for the classification performance of CAD and ICAD. A novel NCM for examples that are represented as sets of points is presented. One of the key properties of this NCM, which is known as the directed Hausdorff k-nearest neighbors (DH-kNN) NCM, is that the p-value for an incomplete test example monotonically decreases as more data points are observed. An instance of CAD based on DH-kNN NCM, known as the sequential Hausdorff nearest neighbor conformal anomaly detector (SHNN-CAD), is presented and discussed for sequential anomaly detection applications. We also investigate classification performance results for the unsupervised online SHNN-CAD on a public dataset of labeled trajectories.","k-Nearest Neighbor,Unsupervised Learning,Inductive Conformal Predictors,One-Class Classification,Sequential Data,Semi-supervised Learning,Anomaly Detection,Hausdorff Distance,"
