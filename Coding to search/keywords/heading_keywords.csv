"enhancing global maritime domain awareness through sar with multiple apertures","2014","This paper investigates and demonstrates enhancements to Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) through the use of a multi-aperture space-based SAR. In contrast to a single channel SAR, it shows how modes can be designed to collect data over a wide swath (enabling wide area surveillance) at high resolution (offering improved vessel detectability and potential for classification). This paper also explores how these same data can be processed using different algorithms to enhance ship detection through clutter suppression and outlines how to estimate vessel headings and speeds. Additionally, it shows that in littoral zones, ambiguities from on-shore clutter can be minimized. Demonstrations of the claims are made using data collected by RADARSAT-2 in a dual-aperture configuration.","vessel heading estimation,ship detection enhancement,multiaperture space-based SAR,RADARSAT-2 dual-aperture configuration,radar detection,radar clutter,Marine vehicles,vessel speed estimation,Synthetic aperture radar,interference suppression,data collection,littoral zone,synthetic aperture radar,MDA,single chan- nel SAR,wide area surveillance,Azimuth,Apertures,spaceborne radar,on-shore clutter suppression,improved vessel detectability,global maritime domain awareness enhancement,improved vessel classification,Estimation,Arrays,oceanographic techniques,"
"a spatiotemporal clustering approach to maritime domain awareness","2013","Spatiotemporal clustering is the process of grouping objects based on both their spatial and temporal similarity. This approach is useful when considering the distance between objects and how that distance changes through time. Spatiotemporal clustering analysis is applied to the maritime domain in this paper, specifically to a defined area of water, during a period of time, in order to gain behavioral knowledge of vessel interactions and provide the opportunity to screen such interactions for further investigation. The proposed spatiotemporal clustering algorithm spatially clusters vessels in the water space using k-means clustering analysis, kinematically refines the clusters based on the similarity of vessel headings, speeds and the distance between them, and temporally analyzes the continuity of membership of the kinematic clusters through time to determine which clusters are moving. The algorithm is implemented in the MATLAB programming environment, verified with a synthetic data scenario, and validated with two real-world datasets.","Kinematics,spatiotemporal clustering algorithm,Clustering algorithms,Spatiotemporal phenomena,Spatiotemporal clustering,maritime domain awareness,Global Positioning System,MATLAB programming,Filtering,marine safety,maritime domain,vessel headings,vessel interaction,water space,marine communication,Visualization,Algorithm design and analysis,k-means clustering analysis,vessel speeds,Arrays,"
"improved gnss vector tracking loop to enhance the navigation performance of usv","2022","The Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) is the most common source of location and heading information for unmanned surface vehicle (USV) in real time. However, in areas such as ports or bridges, the GNSS signal will be occluded or weakened. The carrier frequency and code frequency of scalar tracking (ST) in GNSS receiver fluctuates greatly, and even the tracking loop will lose lock. To enhance the navigation performance of USV's GNSS receiver, this paper proposes a framework that uses fixed-lag smoothing (FLS) to assist vector tracking (VT) and applies unscented Kalman filter in the navigation processor. The pseudo-range error and pseudo-range rate error are used as the measurements of navigation processor. FLS serves as a backward filter to enhance the tracking ability of the code loop. The field experiments show that the positioning error of the proposed method is reduced by 72.1% compared to the traditional VT method in the open-sky environments. When the signal is occluded, the positioning results of the traditional ST are dispersed, and also the traditional VT method displays a large error. Moreover, the proposed method is able to reduce the positioning error by 85.4%. The proposed GNSS loop tracking architecture and method can provide a possible solution for USV's navigation system development.","Signal occlusion,GNSS,Vector tracking,Unmanned surface vehicle,Fixed-lag smoothing,"
"maritime anomaly detection in ferry tracks","2017","This paper proposes a methodology for the automatic detection of anomalous shipping tracks traced by ferries. The approach comprises a set of models as a basis for outlier detection: A Gaussian process (GP) model regresses displacement information collected over time, and a Markov chain based detector makes use of the direction (heading) information. GP regression is performed together with Median Absolute Deviation to account for contaminated training data. The methodology utilizes the coordinates of a given ferry recorded on a second by second basis via Automatic Identification System. Its effectiveness is demonstrated on a dataset collected in the Solent area.","Markov processes,automatic anomalous shipping track detection,Hidden Markov models,unsupervised learning,Marine vehicles,Anomaly Detection,ferry tracks,Markov chain based detector,marine navigation,Gaussian Processes,heading information,displacement information regression,regression analysis,outlier detection,data analysis,Median Absolute Deviation,object tracking,ships,ferry coordinates,automatic identification system,direction information,Training data,Gaussian processes,traffic information systems,Artificial intelligence,median absolute deviation,maritime anomaly detection,Solent area,Maritime Traffic,Gaussian process model,Detectors,"
"a distance-based trajectory outlier detection method on maritime traffic data","2018","As a result of establishment of Automatic Identification System (AIS) networks, maritime vessel trajectories are becoming increasingly available. Finding outliers in a collection of patterns among AIS trajectories is critical for real time applications ranging from military surveillance to transportation management. In this paper we present a distance-based approach for trajectory outlier detection on trajectory data. First, we apply Density Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) to generate patterns from original trajectories. Second, we extract gravity vectors and sample stop points from clusters to retain stop and move information and to reduce the further computation cost. To measure the similarity between trajectory points and clusters, cluster relative distance and cluster angular distance are proposed. Finally, we present experiments on real AIS data at Chinese QiongZhou strait. The experiment results show that our methods can detect distance anomaly and speed/heading anomaly effectively and greatly reduces computation cost.","data mining,Clustering algorithms,maritime traffic data,Anomaly detection,trajectory data,AIS networks,Chinese QiongZhou strait,speed anomaly detection,cluster,trajectory points,density based spatial clustering of applications with noise,outlier detection,cluster relative distance,DBSCAN,Gravity,marine safety,marine engineering,computation cost,AIS,Data models,cluster angular distance,trajectory data mining,distance anomaly,trajectory outlier detection,gravity vectors,AIS trajectories,pattern clustering,Artificial intelligence,distance-based approach,distance-based trajectory outlier detection method,maritime vessel trajectories,heading anomaly detection,Trajectory,traffic engineering computing,stop points,automatic identification system networks,AIS data,"

"connectivity reliabilitsy of container shipping network of the 21st century maritime silk road","2018","A container shipping network of the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road is mainly composed of four heading networks: Southeast Asia, South Asia, Middle East-North Africa and Europe. In this paper, a connectivity reliability simulation model is set up when the ports along the route are under random attack by using the simulation method, and the reachable matrix is introduced to judge the variation of the connectivity reliability of the shipping network and the four heading networks. The container shipping network of the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road was relatively reliable. Among its four heading networks, the connectivity reliability of European heading was relatively poor, and that of Southeast Asia was relatively good. In addition, using qualitative and quantitative methods to judge the node importance and implement the key node protection strategy for re-simulation, it can be gotten that the key node protection strategy is effective to improve the connectivity reliability of the whole network and each heading network.","Middle East-North Africa,Throughput,21st Century Maritime Silk Road,Mathematical model,the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road,Reliability,connectivity reliability,Asia,marine systems,ships,Containers,Southeast Asia,simulation,Europe,heading network,sea ports,Roads,South Asia,connectivity reliability simulation model,ports,key node protection strategy,container shipping network,"
