"rep-enhancer: re-parameterizing neural network for real-time low-light enhancement in visual maritime surveillance","2022","Vision-based maritime surveillance has become an essential part of the vessel traffic services system. The images collected in low-light maritime conditions often suffer from poor visibility. These images may significantly degenerate the performance of high-level visual tasks and increase the uncertainty in maritime surveillance. To address this problem, we propose a lightweight neural network (Rep-Enhancer) for low-light image enhancement. Specifically, we first design a re-parameterizable multi-branch edge extraction module, i.e., spatial domain-oriented convolution block (SDCB). Furthermore, skip connections and spatial attention operations are employed to strengthen the features. By exploiting these well-strengthened edge features, we can enhance the low-light images effectively with the encoder-decoder structure. The experimental results have shown that Rep-Enhancer can enhance the low-light image qualifiedly while maintaining great inference efficiency.","Traffic control,Image edge detection,surveillance,low-light images,low-light,Image enhancement,vessel traffic services system,lightweight neural network,high-level visual tasks,Rep-Enhancer,Feature extraction,image enhancement,Neural networks,edge detection,Visual effects,well-strengthened edge features,low-light maritime conditions,edge feature,maritime surveillance,computer vision,object detection,re-parameterization,multibranch edge extraction module,feature extraction,real-time low-light enhancement,visual maritime surveillance,spatial domain-oriented convolution block,low-light image enhancement,convolutional neural nets,Uncertainty,Surveillance,vision-based maritime surveillance,"
"online fault detection in autonomous ferries: using fault-type independent spectral anomaly detection","2020","Enthusiasm for ship autonomy is flourishing in the maritime industry. In this context, data-driven prognostics and health management (PHM) systems have emerged as the optimal way to improve operational reliability and system safety. However, further research is needed to enhance the essential actions relating to such a system. Fault detection is the first and most crucial action of any data-driven PHM system. In this article, we propose a fault-type independent spectral anomaly detection algorithm for marine diesel engine degradation in autonomous ferries. The benefits of the algorithm are verified on three fault types where the nature of degradation differs. Both normal operation data and faulty degradation data have been collected from a marine diesel engine using two different engine load profiles. These profiles aim to replicate real autonomous ferry crossing operations, environmental conditions that the ferry may encounter. First, the data are subjected to a feature selection process to remove irrelevant and redundant features. Then, a multiregime normalization method is performed on the data to merge the engine loads into one context. Finally, a variational autoencoder is trained to estimate velocity and acceleration calculations of the anomaly score. Generic and dynamic threshold limits are simultaneously established to detect the fault time step online. The algorithm achieved an accuracy of 97.66% in the final test when the acceleration was used as the fault detector. The results suggest that the algorithm is independent of fault types with different nature of degradation related to the marine diesel engine.","operational reliability,generic threshold limit,acceleration calculation,fault-type independent spectral anomaly detection algorithm,variational autoencoder,engine loads,Anomaly detection,fault detector,reliability,multiregime normalization,Acceleration,ship autonomy,prognostics and health management (PHM),neural nets,Autonomous ferry,autonomous ferry crossing operations,system safety,data analysis,marine systems,ships,marine diesel engine degradation,Prognostics and health management,prognostics and health management system,online fault detection,dynamic threshold limit,Diesel engines,data-driven PHM system,mechanical engineering computing,feature selection,feature selection process,diesel engines,Fault detection,condition monitoring,Degradation,environmental conditions,marine diesel engine,maritime industry,failure analysis,Heuristic algorithms,multiregime normalization method,fault diagnosis,velocity calculation,faulty degradation data,"
"ship collision risk assessment based on collision detection algorithm","2020","Ningbo Zhoushan port handled 1.08 billion tons cargoes in 2018 which is considered as the one of biggest ports in the world. There are more than 1 000 ships enter or depart the port per day. Therefore, it is of importance to assess the collision risk for ships passing through the harbor area. In this article, a novel approach is initially proposed to assess ship collision risk in the harbor area based on collision detection technology of ship domain using automatic identified system (AIS) data. This study aims to build a unified framework of collision risk assessment which does not need to build different models in accordance with the ship domain we selected. To clean the historical motion data of ships, a method for anomaly detection of ship static information based on autoencoder (AE) is proposed. Based on the above proposed method, the ship collision frequency can be estimated, besides, the risk area can also be determined. The results obtained from the method could provide a reference on furthering enhance the navigational safety for the Maritime and Port Authority.","historical motion data,collision detection algorithm,Risk management,Safety,anomaly detection,Marine vehicles,safety,ships,marine safety,risk area,Data models,ship collision risk assessment,risk management,ship collision frequency,Artificial intelligence,sea ports,ship domain,risk assessment,automatic identified system data,autoencoder,Context modeling,Ningbo Zhoushan port,navigational safety,Navigation,collision detection,harbor area,Maritime and Port Authority,Waterway transportation,ship static information,"
"pixel-wise ship identification from maritime images via a semantic segmentation model","2022","Accurately identifying ships from maritime surveillance videos attracts increasing attention in the smart ship community, considering that the videos provide informative yet easily understandable spatialâ€“temporal traffic information for varied maritime traffic participants. Previous studies (e.g., ship detection and ship tracking) are conducted by learning distinct features from training samples labeled in terms of bounding boxes, and thus, background pixels may be wrongly trained as ship features. To bridge the gap, we propose a novel approach for achieving a pixel-wise ship segmentation and identification task through a novel design of U-Net deep learning architecture (denoted as EU-Net). The encoder of the EU-Net extracts distinct ship features from input maritime images, and its decoder outputs ship segmentation results in the pixel-wise manner. The proposed EU-Net model consists of encoder and decoder parts via the help of a convolution layer, a depth separable convolution layer, a softmax layer, and so on. More specifically, the EU-Net model identifies each pixel into ship or non-ship as the final output. Experimental results suggest that our proposed model can accurately identify ship (in terms of pixels), considering that the ship segmentation accuracies were larger than 99%. The proposed ship segmentation framework can be further adaptively deployed in the ship sensing system for maritime traffic situation awareness and intelligent visual navigation in a smart ship era.","maritime traffic situation awareness,identification task,Semantics,intelligent visual navigation,Kernel,pixel-wise ship segmentation,understandable spatial-temporal traffic information,deep learning (artificial intelligence),semantic segmentation,maritime surveillance videos,ship detection,EU-Net extracts distinct ship features,smart ship community,Marine vehicles,Feature extraction,input maritime images,Videos,ships,marine engineering,smart ship,ship sensing system,pixel-wise ship identification,object detection,ship segmentation results,feature extraction,image classification,EU-Net model,U-Net deep learning architecture,smart ship era,Convolution,background pixels,Image segmentation,ship segmentation accuracies,semantic segmentation model,maritime traffic participants,Depth separable convolution,image segmentation,video surveillance,ship segmentation framework,pixel-wise manner,"
"motion primitives learning of ship-ship interaction patterns in encounter situations","2022","Understanding the ship encounter situations is a tough task, since the uncertain motions of encountering ships and the long-lasting frequent interactions make the encounter processes dynamic and stochastic. If we can decompose these complex encounter processes into motion primitives, which represent the elementary interaction patterns, an encounter can be more easily understood and identified. In this study, we propose a two-stream Long Short-Term Memory-based autoencoder (LSTM-based AE) approach to extract motion primitives from multi-dimensional encounter data without specific rules and prior knowledge. This approach leverages the sequential representation ability of LSTM to learn the temporal dependencies of each encountering ship motion. Then, we developed a fusion gate named dynamic artificial potential field (DAPF) to fuse the outputs of two LSTMs and generated the high-level representation needed to capture the spatiotemporal relationships of the interactions. After that, through a clustering method, the motion primitives were automatically extracted to describe various interaction patterns. The effectiveness of this approach was validated by naturalistic encounter data. The low reconstruction errors of the LSTM-based AE demonstrated that high-level representations captured the relationships of the interactions in both temporal and spatial dimensions. Case studies demonstrated that the utilization of motion primitives provided a semantically interpretable technique to analyze the interaction patterns and encounter process, which is conducive to situation awareness and decision-making for developing intelligent ships.","Motion primitives,Representation learning,Encounter situation,Two-stream LSTM,Ship-ship interaction,"
"wodis: water obstacle detection network based on image segmentation for autonomous surface vehicles in maritime environments","2021","A reliable obstacle detection system is crucial for autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) to realize fully autonomous navigation with no need of human intervention. However, the current detection methods have particular drawbacks, such as poor detection for small objects, low estimation accuracy caused by water surface reflection, and a high rate of false-positive on water-sky interference. Therefore, we propose a new encoder-decoder structured deep semantic segmentation network, which is a water obstacle detection network based on image segmentation (WODIS), to solve the abovementioned problems. The first design feature of WODIS utilizes the use of an encoder network to extract high-level data based on different sampling rates. In order to improve obstacle detection at sea-sky line areas, an attention refine module (ARM) activated by both global average pooling and max pooling to capture high-level information has been designed and integrated into WODIS. In addition, a feature fusion module (FFM) is introduced to help concatenate the multidimensional high-level features in the decoder network. The WODIS is tested and cross-validated using four different types of maritime datasets with the results demonstrating that the mean intersection over union (mIoU) of WODIS can achieve superior segmentation effects for sea-level obstacles to values as high as 91.3%.","fully autonomous navigation,high-level features,remotely operated vehicles,high-level information,robot vision,Cameras,current detection methods,encoder network,Feature extraction,reliable obstacle detection system,Laser radar,Autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs),water surface reflection,Meteorology,deep neural networks,poor detection,high-level data,water-sky interference,deep semantic segmentation network,object detection,feature extraction,Sea surface,WODIS,autonomous surface vehicles,sea-level obstacles,obstacle detection,decoder network,Image segmentation,water obstacle detection network,mobile robots,Navigation,image segmentation,collision avoidance,"
"a novel model for ship trajectory anomaly detection based on gaussian mixture variational autoencoder","2023","The use of traditional methods in anomaly detection of multi-class ship trajectories showed some limitations in terms of robustness and learning ability of trajectory features. In view of this, an anomaly detection model for ship trajectory data based on Gaussian Mixture Variational Autoencoder (GMVAE) is proposed in this study using an unsupervised classification method. The proposed model modifies Variational Autoencoder (VAE) by changing the inferential distribution of prior distribution and approximate posterior to the Gaussian mixture model. A high-dimensional hidden space is constructed to learn the features of multi-class trajectory data, and the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) method is applied to measure the error between the reconstructed trajectory and the original trajectory in order to judge whether the ship trajectory is abnormal. The Automatic Identification System (AIS) data from the US coastal areas are used to verify the proposed model, and the results are compared with other commonly used models in a manually labeled dataset. The research results indicate that the detection rate of the proposed model is 91.26%, and the false alarm rate is 0.68%, which performs the best. Using the Gaussian mixture model to describe the distribution of hidden space can improve the learning ability of multi-class trajectories of VAE, thus increasing the robustness of the model. This research can provide technical support for ship trajectory data analysis and risk management of maritime transportation.","Trajectory,anomaly detection of ship trajectory,Clustering algorithms,Classification algorithms,Mathematical models,gaussian mixture variational autoencoder (gmvae),unsupervised learning,Gaussian distribution,Marine vehicles,Artificial neural networks,intelligent transportation,AIS,"
"towards low-visibility enhancement in maritime video surveillance: an efficient and effective multi-deep neural network","2021","Limited by insufficient illumination, the images collected by maritime imaging devices often suffer from low brightness, low contrast, low signal-to-noise ratio, severe information loss, and so on. The above problems restrict the development of maritime- related work such as intelligent supervision, collision warning, accident investigation, etc. To improve the imaging quality of maritime video images, we propose an efficient and effective multi-deep neural network (termed EEMNN) for low-visibility enhancement. In particular, we fuse the multi-scale information extracted from the encoder-decoder module using the dense blocks (DBs) and attention blocks (ABs). It is capable of enhancing the fused information leading to preserving the edges, textures, and other fine details. To prevent the overexposure of enhanced images, we fuse and reconstruct the output features of DBs and ABs with the raw low-light image to get the final enhanced image through two residual blocks (RBs). The mixing of multiple network modules can effectively improve the generalization ability and robustness of our network. Through extensive experiments, EEMNN has higher objective evaluation indicators, more efficient enhancement, more natural maritime scenes, and stronger detail-preservation capabilities compared with other enhancement methods.","efficient and effective multideep neural network,natural maritime scenes,image denoising,Lighting,deep learning (artificial intelligence),Feature extraction,low-visibility enhancement,image enhancement,Neural networks,encoder-decoder module,insufficient illumination,attention blocks,dense blocks,information fusion,image colour analysis,ABs,residual blocks,image fusion,maritime video images,low-light image,object detection,intelligent supervision,feature extraction,image texture,multiple network modules,Video surveillance,stronger detail-preservation capabilities,video signal processing,Robustness,marine engineering computing,Fuses,DBs,Imaging,video surveillance,multiscale information,maritime imaging devices,maritime video surveillance,"
"water segmentation with superior guidance and aligned fusion strategy for unmanned surface vehicles in maritime environment","2022","As a mid-level vision task, water segmentation is essential for unmanned surface systems such as to get the sailing area and avoid the floating objects to ensure vehicles safety in maritime environment. However, existing deep learning method of water segmentation has a little weakness on maintaining origin-scale fineness. At the same time, our intuition is that ground truth is a powerful tool for optimizing the global network. In this paper, we give solutions through these two aspects using superior guidance and aligned fusion strategy. Aligned fusion provides symmetric and fine-grained fusion strategy when using encoder-decoder structured network, and superior guidance enforce the segmentation network grasp the discrimination criterion much earlier before output part of the network. Both of them show benefits for water segmentation of unmanned surface system's image data.

"green rf/fso communications in cognitive relay-based space information networks for maritime surveillance","2019","In this paper, we provide an overview of a space-based network for the maritime surveillance information sharing and evaluate the coverage, the throughput and the real-time reception capacity of the presented systems. The focus is on the feeder link of a multi-hop geostationary satellite system. We propose a cognitive relay-based architecture for the inter-satellite and satellite-to-ground communication with a multi-band spectrum sensing operating on both free-space optical (FSO) and radio frequency (RF) bands. Furthermore, modeling the spectrum sensing energy as a Gamma distribution we derive the formula of the network energy consumption in presence of multipath fading and considering two different data relay schemes: amplify-and-forward (AF) and decode-and-forward (DF). We prove that the RF/FSO communication in the proposed relay-based architecture enhances the data transmission increasing the throughput and the real-time reception capacity and reducing the network energy consumption. The performance evaluation shows that the DF scheme overcomes the AF one in terms of energy consumption while the AF scheme overcomes the DF one in terms of probability detection, both experience the same throughput.

"radis: a real-time anomaly detection intelligent system for fault diagnosis of marine machinery","2022","By enhancing data accessibility, the implementation of data-driven models has been made possible to empower strategies in relation to O&M activities. Such models have been extensively applied to perform anomaly detection tasks, with the express purpose of detecting data patterns that deviate significantly from normal operational behaviour. Due to its preeminent importance in the maritime industry to adequately identify the behaviour of marine systems, the Real-time Anomaly Detection Intelligent System (RADIS) framework, constituted by a Long Short-Term Memory-based Variational Autoencoder in tandem with multi-level Otsu’s thresholding, is proposed. RADIS aims to address the current gaps identified within the maritime industry in relation to data-driven model applications for enabling smart maintenance. To assess the performance of such a framework, a case study on a total of 14 parameters obtained from sensors installed on a diesel generator of a tanker ship is introduced to highlight the implementation of RADIS. Results demonstrated the capability of RADIS to be part of a diagnostic analytics tool that will promote the implementation of smart maintenance within the maritime industry, as RADIS detected an average of 92.5% of anomalous instances in the presented case study.","Marine machinery,Deep learning,Intelligent real-time systems,Anomaly detection,Smart maintenance,Ship systems,"
"smart anomaly detection for slocum underwater gliders with a variational autoencoder with long short-term memory networks","2022","Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are used extensively for monitoring the world’s oceans, taking measurements of oceanographic characteristics along the water column. Presently, there is no holistic anomaly detection system in operation and AUVs require experienced pilots to monitor the progress of missions. This results in a large operational overhead and reduces the number of AUVs that can be deployed simultaneously. This article proposes an online anomaly detection system for underwater gliders based on a data-driven approach. A novel Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Variational Autoencoder (VAE) has been developed and trained using field data from four deployments with healthy glider behaviour and then tested against four deployments where faults are present. The system is able to detect wing loss with a high degree of accuracy on gliders unseen during the models training, highlighting the generality of the model to different platforms. Additionally, the VAE method outperforms model-based solution for the detection of biofouling, proving its generality to different types of anomalies. The proposed smart anomaly detection will contribute to increasing the capacity of AUVs and reducing the dependence on support vessels and experienced pilots.","Underwater glider,Variational autoencoder,Marine autonomous system,Anomaly detection,Long short-term memory network,"
"flexible data integrity checking with original data recovery in iot-enabled maritime transportation systems","2023","Internet of things (IoT) has emerged as a promising technology that can be widely used in various industries to realize real-time information collection, so as to improve production efficiency and reduce running costs. By combining the technology of IoT, maritime transportation systems (MTS) can prevent vessels collision, improve the efficiency of maritime transportation and reduce the loss of revenue for ports and shipbuilders. The large amount of real-time data generated in IoT-enabled MTS can be efficiently utilized to predict the future trajectories and hotspots of vessels on the sea combined with historical data. However, the maritime traffic data in MTS cannot be effectively processed in traditional big data analysis methods, and the integrity of it needs to be checked before being used to achieve the prediction of trajectories and high-density areas of vessels. In this paper, we propose a flexible data integrity checking scheme with original data recovery in IoT-enabled MTS. In the proposed scheme, the data blocks of vessels are encoded based on the technology of erasure coding. To ensure the availability of the historical data, the existence and the integrity of the data elements stored in the cloud can be checked. Moreover, the original data blocks can be recovered efficiently if the encoded data elements have been corrupted or deleted.

"decoding the mechanism of formation in marine ooids: a review","2019","Ooid shoals, sedimentary structures consisting of carbonate grains, are often used as proxies to explore changes in seawater chemistry over Earth history. Despite their importance as contributors to the global carbonate budget and as paleo-environmental indicators for water depth, pH, temperature and water energy, the mechanism of formation of these concentric, sub-spherical concretions of tangentially or radially arranged aragonite or calcite crystals is still the subject of intense debate. Unlike oncoids, whose microbial origins are well acknowledged, ooids are traditionally viewed as abiotic grains, mainly produced in suspension by agitated, warm waters that are supersaturated with respect to CaCO3. Yet, there is considerable evidence, including geochemical bio-signatures and detection of viable microbes capable of mineralization and biofilm production and degradation, to suggest otherwise. The emergence of new and sophisticated technologies reveals that the level of microbial diversity of these sedimentary grains exceeds that of some microbialite systems. These findings have refined our understanding of ooid genesis and ooid accretion processes and argue toward microbial mediation both as a direct result of metabolic activities inducing changes in the environment conducive to precipitation and by a passive mechanism, in which mucilaginous extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) act as a template for mineral nucleation. Furthermore, new developments in the field indicate that carbonate mineralization in marine ooids occurs through sequential precipitations that involve an amorphous calcium carbonate phase (ACC), which some argue are of biotic origins. Herein, we discuss the most relevant theories of ooid formation, including some of the early pioneering studies that laid the groundwork for new theories attempting to decode the origins of these controversial grains.","Organomineralization,Ooids,Amorphous calcium carbonate,Microbial metabolism,EPS,Carbonate precipitation,Microbe-mineral interactions,"

Voluntary broadcasts of vessel position and velocity via AIS are received and decoded, and compared with SAR observations to verify the data and identify potentially non-cooperative vessels. Limited transmit power and downlink time will dictate that data be processed onboard the spacecraft.

"image-consistent detection of road anomalies as unpredictable patches","2023","We propose a novel method for anomaly detection primarily aiming at autonomous driving. The design of the method, called DaCUP (Detection of anomalies as Consistent Unpredictable Patches), is based on two general properties of anomalous objects: an anomaly is (i) not from a class that could be modelled and (ii) it is not similar (in appearance) to non-anomalous objects in the image. To this end, we propose a novel embedding bottleneck in an auto-encoder like architecture that enables modelling of a diverse, multi-modal known class appearance (e.g. road). Secondly, we introduce novel image-conditioned distance features that allow known class identification in a nearest-neighbour manner on-the-fly, greatly increasing its ability to distinguish true and false positives. Lastly, an inpainting module is utilized to model the uniqueness of detected anomalies and significantly reduce false positives by filtering regions that are similar, thus reconstructable from their neighbourhood. We demonstrate that filtering of regions based on their similarity to neighbour regions, using e.g. an inpainting module, is general and can be used with other methods for reduction of false positives.

"maritime radar target detection using convolutional neural networks","2022","Maritime airborne surveillance radars operating at medium to high grazing angles experience significant sea clutter returns with a time and range-varying Doppler spectra, thus making the detection of small targets extremely difficult. This has led to the development of new techniques to better isolate targets from the background sea clutter. In this paper, two convolutional neural network approaches are proposed. They include a method of reconstructing maritime point target signals, while rejecting non-homogeneous clutter and a novel approach that is able to directly locate the target signal peak from sea clutter using a convolutional autoencoder trained in a supervised manner. These two approaches may be considered pre-processing stages in a detection scheme, with a simple threshold detection scheme used to detect targets with a desired false alarm rate.","airborne radar,isolate targets,marine radar,radar detection,target detection,radar clutter,simple threshold detection scheme,neural nets,target tracking,background sea clutter,convolutional autoencoder,nonhomogeneous clutter,Training data,maritime airborne surveillance radars,object detection,target signal peak,search radar,maritime point target signals,convolutional neural network,Radar clutter,radar signal processing,Radar sea clutter,Convolution,convolutional neural networks,clutter,Azimuth,Doppler radar,maritime radar target detection,Object detection,learning (artificial intelligence),high grazing angles,significant sea clutter returns,convolutional neural network approaches,Radar detection,"
"wasrâ€”a water segmentation and refinement maritime obstacle detection network","2022","Obstacle detection using semantic segmentation has become an established approach in autonomous vehicles. However, existing segmentation methods, primarily developed for ground vehicles, are inadequate in an aquatic environment as they produce many false positive (FP) detections in the presence of water reflections and wakes. We propose a novel deep encoderâ€“decoder architecture, a water segmentation and refinement (WaSR) network, specifically designed for the marine environment to address these issues. A deep encoder based on ResNet101 with atrous convolutions enables the extraction of rich visual features, while a novel decoder gradually fuses them with inertial information from the inertial measurement unit (IMU). The inertial information greatly improves the segmentation accuracy of the water component in the presence of visual ambiguities, such as fog on the horizon. Furthermore, a novel loss function for semantic separation is proposed to enforce the separation of different semantic components to increase the robustness of the segmentation. We investigate different loss variants and observe a significant reduction in FPs and an increase in true positives (TPs). Experimental results show that WaSR outperforms the current state of the art by approximately 4% in F1 score on a challenging unmanned surface vehicle dataset. WaSR shows remarkable generalization capabilities and outperforms the state of the art by over 24% in F1 score on a strict domain generalization experiment.","separation loss,Semantic segmentation,Neural Networks,remotely operated vehicles,semantic segmentation,different loss variants,ResNet101,water component,unmanned surface vehicles (USVs),Feature extraction,marine environment,novel decoder,water reflections,Image Processing,WaSR-a water segmentation,novel loss function,atrous convolutions,false positive detections,ground vehicles,inertial measurement unit,computer vision,autonomous vehicles,feature extraction,Computer,challenging unmanned surface vehicle dataset,different semantic components,positives,wakes,obstacle detection,segmentation accuracy,inertial information,Water,Image segmentation,established approach,Autonomous vehicles,mobile robots,Deep learning,aquatic environment,deep encoder-decoder architecture,refinement maritime obstacle detection network,Computer-Assisted,image segmentation,collision avoidance,existing segmentation methods,learning (artificial intelligence),visual ambiguities,refinement network,rich visual features,semantic separation,"
"a deep semantic autoencoder for maritime wireless communications","2023","With the rapid development of maritime transportation, ocean tourism, monitoring, surveillance and aquaculture, the maritime communication industry has encountered new opportunities. Maritime End-to-end (E2E) communication systems based on deep learning (DL) have become diverse, while semantic communication systems have become a critical research point due to their ability to understand and analyze natural language. In this paper, we propose a deep semantic autoencoder (DSA) for maritime wireless communications. The DSA consists of a semantic encoder, channel encoder, channel decoder, and semantic decoder. The DSA employs transformers and convolutional neural networks to extract and restore the meaning of sentences while minimizing semantic errors during transmission. In order to enhance the effectiveness of the DSA in transmitting maritime data, the Rician fading channel is utilized to simulate complex and varied marine environments. Furthermore, the system parameters of the DSA are optimized through training the maritime data and calculating the loss functions. Extensive simulation experiments indicate that compared to the benchmark, the DSA demonstrates superior bilingual evaluation understudy and sentence similarity performance under different signal-to-noise ratio conditions, indicating its ability to effectively extract semantics.","end-to-end,semantic communication systems,Semantics,surveillance,maritime data,Transportation,Benchmark testing,deep learning (artificial intelligence),system parameters,maritime wireless communications,semantic encoder,maritime communication industry,deep semantic autoencoder,natural language processing,semantic errors,Wireless communication,critical research point,deep learning,marine safety,semantics,marine engineering,Maritime wireless communications,Rician channels,maritime transportation,maritime end-to-end communication systems,convolutional neural nets,semantic decoder,Training,ocean tourism,marine communication,Simulation,Surveillance,artificial intelligence,DSA,channel decoder,aquaculture,Rician fading channel,"
"from unsupervised to semi-supervised anomaly detection methods for hrrp targets","2020","Responding to the challenge of detecting unusual radar targets in a well identified environment, innovative anomaly and novelty detection methods keep emerging in the literature. This work aims at presenting a benchmark gathering common and recently introduced unsupervised anomaly detection (AD) methods, the results being generated using high-resolution range profiles. A semi-supervised AD (SAD) is considered to demonstrate the added value of having a few labeled anomalies to improve performances. Experiments were conducted with and without pollution of the training set with anomalous samples in order to be as close as possible to real operational contexts. The common AD methods composing our baseline will be One-Class Support Vector Machines (OC-SVM), Isolation Forest (IF), Local Outlier Factor (LOF) and a Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE). The more innovative AD methods put forward by this work are Deep Support Vector Data Description (Deep SVDD) and Random Projection Depth (RPD), belonging respectively to deep and shallow AD. The semi-supervised adaptation of Deep SVDD constitutes our SAD method. HRRP data was generated by a coastal surveillance radar, our results thus suggest that AD can contribute to enhance maritime and coastal situation awareness.","semisupervised anomaly detection methods,Pollution,unusual radar targets,benchmark gathering,Support vector machines,Anomaly detection,radar detection,HRRP targets,anomaly detection,unsupervised learning,high-resolution range profiles,Neural networks,semisupervised adaptation,novelty detection methods,radar target detection,radar computing,innovative anomaly,support vector machines,SAD method,machine learning,object detection,radar target recognition,innovative AD methods,search radar,identified environment,Deep SVDD,high-resolution range profile,Radar,common AD methods,convolutional neural nets,labeled anomalies,Training,One-Class Support Vector Machines,neural network,semisupervised AD,Radar detection,"
"fault detection with lstm-based variational autoencoder for maritime components","2021","Maintenance routines on ships today follow either a reactive maintenance (RM) or preventive maintenance (PvM) approach. RM can be regarded as post-failure repair, which might create large costs. PvM uses predetermined maintenance intervals, which often involves unnecessary maintenance. Recently, prognostics and health management (PHM) has emerged as a potential way to develop an ideal maintenance policy. PHM aims to provide optimal maintenance schedule through the use of sensor measurement for fault detection and fault prognostics, among which fault detection is the first and fundamental action. In this paper, a long-short term memory based variational autoencoder (LSTM-VAE) is proposed for fault detection of maritime components onboard. It is a semi-supervised approach that requires only fault-free data for training. Therefore, it is widely applicable in the maritime industry since operational data in normal conditions already exists. Real-world operation data collected from a diesel engine on the research vessel (RV) Gunnerus is used to validate the method. Results show that the LSTM-VAE can detect the fault accurately.","Decoding,unnecessary maintenance,maritime components,fault-free data,optimal maintenance schedule,preventive maintenance,prognostic and health management,Anomaly detection,anomaly detection,Recurrent neural networks,maintenance engineering,fault detection,ship autonomy,fault prognostics,maintenance routines,ships,PvM,Prognostics and health management,LSTM-VAE,maintenance intervals,railway safety,PHM,Fault detection,condition monitoring,Training,post-failure repair,ideal maintenance policy,LSTM-based variational autoencoder,Sensors,RM,fault diagnosis,"

"improved denoising autoencoder for maritime image denoising and semantic segmentation of usv","2020","Unmanned surface vehicle (USV) is currently a hot research topic in maritime communication network (MCN), where de-noising and semantic segmentation of maritime images taken by USV have been rarely studied. The former has recently researched on autoencoder model used for image denoising, but the existed models are too complicated to be suitable for real-time detection of USV. In this paper, we proposed a lightweight autoencoder combined with inception module for maritime image denoising in different noisy environments and explore the effect of different inception modules on the denoising performance. Furthermore, we completed the semantic segmentation task for maritime images taken by USV utilizing the pretrained U-Net model with tuning, and compared them with original U-Net model based on different backbone. Subsequently, we compared the semantic segmentation of noised and denoised maritime images respectively to explore the effect of image noise on semantic segmentation performance. Case studies are provided to prove the feasibility of our proposed denoising and segmentation method. Finally, a simple integrated communication system combining image denoising and segmentation for USV is shown.","Semantics,improved denoising autoencoder,semantic segmentation task,image denoising,semantic segmentation,U-Net model,marine robots,Feature extraction,MCN,Noise measurement,maritime image denoising,neural nets,image noise,Noise reduction,object detection,Image denoising,Image segmentation,maritime communication network,Training,marine communication,autoencoder,U-Net,unmanned surface vehicle,image segmentation,USV,denoising,"
"use of noma for maritime communication networks with p-df relaying channel","2020","In this paper, a partial de-code-and-forward (P-DF) cooperative relaying network (CRN) with non-orthogonal multiple access (P-DF-CRN-NOMA) for maritime space communications is proposed. Without loss of generality, three kinds of relay forwarding protocols are studied to characterize the superiority of the proposed P-DF-CRN-NOMA scheme, where, after receptions from the coastal base station (BS), the island relay forwards the successful decoded symbols to the ship user to avoid the performance loss provided by the high decoding requirement in decode-and-forward (DF). To further improve the system performance, as well as for a fairness comparison, the maximum ratio combining (MRC) is utilized at the ship user. Specifically, to present the impact of the channel qualities, the scenarios of the weak and strong links that from the source to destination (S-D) are both considered. The closed-form expressions for the outage probability of the P-DF-CRN-NOMA are derived considering the three proposed forwarding cases. Qualitative numerical results corroborating our theoretical analysis, especially for the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), show that the proposed P-DF-CRN-NOMA scheme significantly improves the outage probability performance in comparison to the conventional CRN-NOMA schemes. Furthermore, for an increased S-D link, the corresponding outage probability performance will be also better for all the cases.","Decoding,telecommunication network reliability,cooperative relaying networks (CRN),nonorthogonal multiple access,Marine vehicles,non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA),maritime space communications,outage probability,decoding,Power system reliability,NOMA,Communication networks,Relays,error statistics,power allocation,P-DF relaying channel,maximum ratio combining,cooperative relaying network,protocols,relay networks (telecommunication),diversity reception,partial decode and forward network,coastal base station,decode and forward communication,cooperative communication,probability,relay forwarding protocols,marine communication,outage probability performance,Probability,maritime communication networks,multi-access systems,island relay,partial decode-and-for-ward (P-DF),P-DF-CRN-NOMA scheme,"
