"effect of smart meter data collection frequency in an early detection of shorter-duration voltage anomalies in smart grids","2019","Smart grids are required to respond quickly and efficiently to any types of electrical incidents. This is possible only if advanced monitoring and decision support tools are available for the operators to collect and analyze the real-time data from the entire power system. Sensors and smart meters become necessary for an effective smart grid operation, as they can play a significant role in measuring system parameters such as the temperature of the transmission line, power outages and power usage. These sensors allow communication between the generation side and user side to ensure full network observability. Hence, the volume of data which needs to be analyzed for more reliable electrical services has been increased. Upon the analysis of all the data collected, useful insights can be gained to bring benefits to the utilities, consumers and the related organizations. In this project, the effect of smart meter data collection frequencies on the early detection of short-duration voltage anomalies has been investigated. An anomaly detection algorithm that analyzes the voltages collected from smart meters is developed. The proposed anomaly detector checks the normality of the voltage data collected from the smart meters installed at the residential loads. To test the effectiveness of the frequent-and-large smart meter data, a smart grid model was simulated in MATLAB/Simulink and the model was tested under three different operating conditions. The efficacy of the anomaly detector with the smart meter data collected at different data collection intervals was compared under the three operating conditions. The investigation of the smart meter data clearly shows that the shorter-duration anomalies can be detected effectively with more frequent data and hence it reveals the potential of smart meters in the early detection of short-duration anomalies in smart grids.","Smart devices,Anomaly detection system,Photovoltaic system,Large data,Smart grid,"
"low-cost, intelligent drifter fleet for large-scale, distributed ocean observation","2022","We have developed Persistent Environmental Awareness Reporting and Location (PEARL) ocean drifters. PEARL drifters are small, rugged, low-cost, autonomous, environmentally friendly ocean drifters that represent a significant opportunity for high-impact applications in both national security and environmental ecosystem monitoring. Drifters record and report data which is processed by advanced edge analytics before being compressed for satellite transmission to populate a large data repository with sensor data that is combined and analyzed to discover signals of interest in the ocean environment with the goal of increasing distributed maritime awareness. Each drifter is entirely self-contained, powered by solar panels and backup batteries, with a large array of sensors, compute module for onboard data processing, and satellite modem for data reporting. The drifter architecture is flexible and can be customized for a specific purpose. The complete data record is stored locally and processed by the onboard compute module, which runs anomaly detection algorithms that detect nearby activity. Anomalous events, as well as baseline environmental data, are reported to a cloud database using satellite short burst data transmission. Though each independent drifter is a powerful sensing tool, the low unit cost permits large scale deployment. To date thousands of drifters have been deployed over vast areas of the ocean and are reporting data to a remote database where cloud-based analytics algorithms develop global situational awareness and update local edge algorithms on the drifters based on learnings across the full network.","Satellites,data reporting,remote sensing,distributed ocean observation,complete data record,environmental ecosystem monitoring,Location ocean drifters,lagrangian drifter,intelligent drifter fleet,high-impact applications,anomaly detection,maritime domain awareness,drifter architecture,Persistent Environmental Awareness Reporting,Distributed databases,environmental data,vessel tracking,satellite communication,marine systems,Turning,oceanographic equipment,sensor data,advanced edge analytics,onboard compute module,cloud computing,ocean circulation,baseline environmental data,satellite transmission,Oceans,geophysics computing,data reduction,ocean environment,maritime awareness,satellite modem,data repository,edge processing,PEARL drifters,oceanographic regions,onboard data processing,Roads,cloud-edge algorithms,Cloud computing,national security,satellite short burst data transmission,Sensors,environmentally friendly ocean drifters,oceanographic techniques,"

"multiocular surveilance of wide dynamic environments based on optical vision, event modelling and end-to-end data encryption: a cloud-based monitoring approach of maritime activities","2012","The success of contemporary surveillance systems depends on their cost and their ability to automatically and correctly interpret events that take place in an observed environment. Correct decisions enhance the situation awareness of an operator, while wrong ones lead to false or no alarms, damaging the system's credibility.

"deep learning techniques for securing cyber-physical systems in supply chain 4.0","2023","The fourth industrial revolution's transformation utilizes a Cyber-Physical System (CPS) to secure Supply Chain 4.0. It integrates manufacturing information with internet communication technology to create a smart CPS that tracks products from manufacture to customer delivery using the Internet of Things (IoT). This research uses a Machine Learning (ML) approach for network anomaly detection and constructing data-driven models to detect DDoS attacks on Industry 4.0 CPSs. Limitations of existing techniques, such as artificial data and small datasets, are addressed by capturing network traffic data from a real-world semiconductor production factory. 45 bidirectional network flow features are extracted, and labeled datasets are constructed for training and testing ML models. The proposed PCA-BSO algorithm is employed to select the most relevant features based on their eigenvalues, as the feature with the highest eigenvalues may not always improve classification accuracy.

"environmental information-aided electromagnetic propagation testbed for maritime communication","2023","Maritime channel modeling can be affected by some key time-varying environmental factors. The ducting effect is one of the thorniest factors since it causes anomalous propagation enhancement and severe co-channel interference. Moreover, the atmospheric attenuation is much more severe in the ocean environment, resulting in shorter coverage distance and more link outage. In this paper, we propose an environmental information-aided electromagnetic propagation testbed. It is based on complex refractivity estimation and improved parabolic equation propagation model, taking into account both ducting effect and atmospheric attenuation. A large-scale temporal and spatial propagation measurement was conducted with meteorological acquisition. We consider practical path loss and ducting conditions to verify the testbed feasibility in these long-distance radio links. The simulation results are in good agreement with the measured data, which further reveal the basic temporal and spatial distribution of ducting effect at 3.5 GHz band.","telecommunication network reliability,parabolic equation propagation model,radio links,broadband maritime communication,long-distance radio links,link outage,spatial propagation measurement,electromagnetic wave propagation,Temperature measurement,shorter coverage distance,path loss,anomalous propagation enhancement,atmospheric attenuation,Sea measurements,environmental information-aided electromagnetic propagation,Meteorology,ducting effect,Atmospheric modeling,microwave propagation,Attenuation,practical path loss,maritime channel,ocean environment,spatial distribution,Atmospheric measurements,complex refractivity estimation,maritime communication,electromagnetic propagation testbed,key time-varying environmental factors,maritime channel modeling,parabolic equations,marine communication,meteorology,frequency 3.5 GHz,Refractive index,temporal distribution,refractive index,propagation measurement,meteorological acquisition,co-channel interference,"
"deep learning aided beam vector assignment for massive mimo maritime communication considering location information and handover impact","2022","Location aided beamforming (LAB) has been proposed as a potential solution to fast beam vector (BV) selection for massive multi-input multi-output (M-MIMO) maritime communication systems. However, the existing LAB schemes hardly consider the impact from handover. In this paper, we propose to apply the Gaussian anomaly detection (GAD) to improve the system performance, particularly in the handover zone, by exploiting the information of sea lane and locations of the user equipment (UE). Furthermore, inspired by the rationale of deep learning (DL) aided image processing methods, we first transform the BV assignment problem to a location-based artificial gray value classification problem, and then utilize a convolutional deep belief networks (CDBN) to predict the BV indices from a predefined codebook constituted by location-related feature matrices. In addition, we exploit GAD to rectify the training data of CDBN, such that the prediction on BV assignments can be more accurate to achieve a higher capacity than known methods. Finally, an extensive comparison with selected existing schemes through simulations demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.","Convolutional deep belief network (CDBN),Maritime communication,Deep learning (DL),Massive multiple input multiple output (M-MIMO),Gaussian anomaly detection (GAD),"
"a distributed lightning fast maritime anomaly detection service","2019","For applications such as navigation and others, timeliness is a top priority; making the right decision steering a vessel away from danger, is only useful if it is a decision made in due time. Effectiveness of such time critical computing systems is dependent not only on the accuracy of the result produced, but also on the time in which it was computed. In this paper, we present a distributed architecture capable of detecting possible collisions, groundings, unexpected communication gaps and travel pattern deviations of ships fitted with Automatic Identification System transponders. Our results demonstrate that the proposed system can achieve good accuracy and sub second latency in real world conditions.","Anomaly detection,Marine vehicles,Monitoring,Anomaly Detection,marine navigation,security of data,unexpected communication gaps,distributed architecture capable,ships,decision steering,marine engineering,Automatic Identification System,distributed lightning fast maritime anomaly detection service,Automatic Identification System transponders,Computer architecture,Artificial intelligence,Real-time systems,Big Data,travel pattern deviations,Engines,time critical computing systems,navigation,Maritime Situational Awareness,"
"fuzzy/human risk analysis for maritime situational awareness and decision support","2017","Human computation (HC) is an active research field in which people play a notable role as computational elements in an automated system with the aim of arriving at a truly symbiotic human-computer interaction. Situational awareness (SA) and decision support systems (DSSs) are two domains where human computation is rapidly advancing, with the latter arising as an invaluable vehicle to achieve the former. Fuzzy systems and fuzzy logic are two commonly employed tools in these domains due to their inherent capabilities of representing and processing vague and imprecise information while conveying the analysis results in an interpretable fashion. In this paper, we elaborate on the human computation aspects of risk analysis within SA and DSS conducted with the aid of fuzzy sets. The study makes the following contributions: (1) we argue that risk analysis must be a highly automated yet still human-centric endeavour and highlight four manners in which the human component provides value to the underlying data/information fusion processes; (2) we illustrate this fuzzy/human risk analysis methodology through a multi-modular Risk Management Framework (RMF) architecture and its application to the maritime domain, particularly in hard-soft data fusion, automated response generation to maritime incidents, port anomaly filtering and dynamic risk management triggered by contextual knowledge and (3) the framework under discussion can be extrapolated to other domains with negligible effort.","decision support systems,RMF,HC,Risk management,Hidden Markov models,human computer interaction,Human computer interaction,fuzzy logic,maritime situational awareness,marine engineering,risk management,human computation,Spread spectrum communication,Decision support systems,human risk analysis,DSS,risk management framework,fuzzy systems,Data mining,Fuzzy risk analysis,"

"application of ray tracing for beyond-line-of-sight maritime communication in evaporation ducts","2023","Atmospheric ducts provide a potential way to establish beyond-line-of-sight (B-LoS) links for maritime communications. Based on the ray tracing (RT) method, long distance propagation in the maritime evaporation duct environment is studied in this paper. The variations of horizontal distance and height are calculated according to the refractivity distribution. Eigenrays between transmitter (Tx) and receiver (Rx) are determined by tracing the ray trajectories. Furthermore, the path loss, delay spread, and angles of arrival (AoAs) are estimated. Simulation results calculated by the RT method match theoretical results generated by parabolic equation (PE) methods in the short range. In the B-LoS range, the path loss estimated by RT is a bit higher than that estimated by PE. In the RT model, the increase in the number of rays calculated in the B-LoS range may lead to this case. Simulation results show that the RT method can well evaluate the anomalous propagation in the evaporation duct and estimate channel parameters effectively.","long distance propagation,ray tracing,atmospheric ducts,Ducts,beyond-line-of-sight maritime communication,channel parameter estimation,ducts,horizontal distance variations,receiver,path loss,B-LoS links,path loss estimation,RT method,Wireless communication,Transmitters,anomalous propagation,delay estimation,channel estimation,evaporation duct,eigenrays,maritime evaporation duct environment,angle of arrival estimation,B-LoS range,parabolic equation methods,direction-of-arrival estimation,wireless channels,transmitter,parabolic equations,beyond-line-of-sight,marine communication,ray trajectories,Simulation,Receivers,Refractive index,delay spread,ray tracing method,refractive index,acoustic wave propagation,Ray tracing,refractivity distribution,"
"research into vessel behaviour pattern recognition in the maritime domain: past, present and future","2021","A comprehensive literature review on vessel behaviour pattern recognition in maritime and littoral environments, spanning a period of three decades, is presented. A vast majority of research focuses on anomalous vessel behaviour detection from Automated Identification System (AIS) data, using artificial intelligence (AI), Bayesian networks and machine learning based methods. AIS is a cooperative system that employs VHF transceivers to share vessel information through terrestrial and satellite communication networks. To track small boats not fitted with AIS, uncooperative surveillance systems are employed. These systems have been studied in a relatively small number of publications. In vessel behaviour pattern recognition, target classification is critically important, particularly, in asymmetric warfare situations. The paper concludes with a discussion of future outlook in vessel behaviour pattern recognition research.","Vessel behaviour recognition,Target tracking,Pattern of life,Anomaly detection,Plan recognition,Bayesian networks,Target classification,"
"detecting anomalous deviations from standard maritime routes using the ornsteinâ€“uhlenbeck process","2018","A novel anomaly detection procedure based on the Ornsteinâ€“Uhlenbeck (OU) mean-reverting stochastic process is presented. The considered anomaly is a vessel that deviates from a planned route, changing its nominal velocity $\boldsymbol{v}_0$. In order to hide this behavior, the vessel switches off its automatic identification system (AIS) device for a time  $T$ and then tries to revert to the previous nominal velocity $\boldsymbol{v}_0$. The decision that has to be made is declaring that a deviation either happened or not, relying only upon two consecutive AIS contacts. Furthermore, the extension to the scenario in which multiple contacts (e.g., radar) are available during the time period $T$ is also considered. A proper statistical hypothesis testing procedure that builds on the changes in the OU process long-term velocity parameter $\boldsymbol{v}_0$ of the vessel is the core of the proposed approach and enables the solution of the anomaly detection problem. Closed analytical forms are provided for the detection and false alarm probabilities of the hypothesis test.","real-world data,AIS contacts,Anomaly detection,anomaly detection problem,Marine vehicles,mean-reverting stochastic process,statistical hypothesis testing,target tracking,Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process,automatic identification system,marine engineering,stochastic processes,statistical testing,radar,long term prediction of vessel motion,standard maritime routes,Ornsteinâ€“Uhlenbeck process,Artificial intelligence,maritime anomaly detection,Maritime surveillance,statistical hypothesis test,Trajectory,probability,anomalous deviation detection,Transponders,marine communication,anomaly detection procedure,Spaceborne radar,"
"engine vibration anomaly detection in vessel engine room","2022","Unsupervised and autonomous operations require new, more efficient, and smarter technical solutions. Digitalization is one of the enablers of autonomous operation, with installing new sensors and using the data for AI and machine learning. The trend is to move the handling the vast amount of data from sensors, installed in machines, and devices, close to the sensors. This way, data communication can be heavily reduced, while the latency of decisions based on data can be minimal. This is achieved by moving the advanced data analysis capabilities from the cloud to the edge. In this paper, the driver of technological development is the concept of an unmanned machine room, where the normal inspections performed by personnel are automated using sensors and algorithms.We present an analysis of vibration data, recorded at a cruise ferry\x92s engines, using a signal processing method called cepstrums. A cepstrum is a version of frequency analysis, intending to identify and visualize periodic structures in data using cepstrograms. Compared to spectrogram analysis, usage of cepstrogram enables better visualization of engine behavior into the shape of audio signals. This helped us discover the run-time vibration routine of the engines from where we could observe unusual vibration sensing generated from the engine.

"ai-empowered maritime internet of things: a parallel-network-driven approach","2020","As one of the key technologies for realizing a fully digitalized world, the Internet of Things (IoT) requires ubiquitous connections across both land and sea. However, due to lack of infrastructure such as optical fibers and base stations, maritime communications inevitably face a highly complex and heterogeneous environment, which greatly challenges the connection reliability and traffic steering efficiency for future service-oriented maritime IoT. With the recent burgeoning application of artificial intelligence (AI) in many fields, an AI-empowered autonomous network for maritime IoT is envisioned as a promising solution. However, AI typically involves training/learning processes, which require realistic data/environment in order to obtain valuable outcomes. To this end, this article proposes the parallel network, which can be regarded as the 'digital twin' of the real network and is responsible for realizing four key functionalities: self-learning and optimizing, state inference and network cognition, event prediction and anomaly detection, and knowledge database and snapshots. We then explain how various AI methods can facilitate the operation of the parallel- network-driven maritime network. A case study is provided to demonstrate the idea. Research directions are also outlined for further studies.","maritime network,Internet of Things,anomaly detection,Marine vehicles,traffic steering efficiency,network cognition,heterogeneous environment,Reinforcement learning,base stations,AI-empowered autonomous network,state inference,event prediction,ubiquitous computing,AI-empowered maritime Internet of Things,highly complex environment,service-oriented maritime IoT,Databases,computer network reliability,connection reliability,optical fibers,training-learning processes,knowledge database,parallel network,Complexity theory,marine communication,artificial intelligence,learning (artificial intelligence),ubiquitous connections,maritime communications,"
"multi-label classification for ais data anomaly detection using wavelet transform","2022","Thanks to the Automatic Identification System (AIS), ships and other maritime equipment are able to communicate with each other, for example, by sending information about their position. This solution allows for early collision detection when two or more ships are on a collision course. In the newer version of AIS, a satellite infrastructure is used to extend the communication range. Unfortunately, satellite AIS deals with so-called packet collision effect: since there is a problem with synchronizing AIS data coming from multiple terrestrial areas, a single satellite may receive several AIS messages at the same time and be unable to correctly process them, causing the data to get lost or garbled. In this article, a machine learning based framework for detecting the incorrect AIS data is presented. In this approach, after the first stage (clustering), a dedicated anomaly detection algorithm searches for damaged AIS messages and conducts multi-label classification (with Random Forest and wavelet transform) to decide which fields of such message requires further correction. The results of measuring the effectiveness of the proposed approach using real AIS data are presented.","telecommunication security,Clustering algorithms,incorrect AIS data,single satellite,Anomaly detection,Wavelet transforms,anomaly detection,random forests,collision course,Marine vehicles,Machine learning,damaged AIS messages,Data analysis,dedicated anomaly detection algorithm searches,satellite communication,ships,wavelet transform,pattern classification,random forest,Classification algorithms,multiple terrestrial areas,pattern clustering,machine learning based framework,Artificial intelligence,multi-label classification,multilabel classification,wavelet transforms,satellite infrastructure,AIS data anomaly detection,maritime equipment,communication range,Trajectory,marine communication,Labeling,early collision detection,AIS data analysis,packet collision effect,satellite AIS deals,"
