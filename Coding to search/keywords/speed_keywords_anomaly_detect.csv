"maritime anomaly detection in a real-world scenario: ever given grounding in the suez canal","2022","In this paper we present how automatic maritime anomaly detection tools can be successfully applied in real-world situations such as the major event of the container vessel Ever Given, which grounded in the Suez Canal on March 23rd 2021. The anomaly detector is designed to process the available sequence of Automatic Identification System (AIS) reports, information from ground-based or satellite radar systems if available, and contextual information defining the expected nominal behavior of navigation. A statistical hypothesis testing procedure is sequentially run to decide whether or not a deviation from the nominal behavior happened within a specific time period, for instance two consecutive data points. We show, based on the recorded AIS data from the Ever Given, that the proposed detector could have been triggered and alerted to anomalous behavior fully 19 minutes before the grounding.","anomaly detector,Anomaly detection,Marine vehicles,Grounding,statistical hypothesis testing,Ever Given grounding,automatic maritime anomaly detection tools,statistical analysis,Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process,Testing,ships,Containers,automatic identification system,radar,maritime surveillance,satellite radar systems,contextual information,container vessel,Suez Canal,Artificial intelligence,ground-based system,marine engineering computing,Maritime anomaly detection,Irrigation,statistical hypothesis testing procedure,expected nominal behavior,AIS data,"

"maritime situational awareness forensics tools for a common information sharing environment (cise)","2019","CISE stands for Common Information Sharing Environment and refers to an architecture and set of protocols, procedures and services for the exchange of data and information across Maritime Authorities of EU (European Union) Member States (MS's). In the context of enabling the implementation and adoption of CISE by different MS's, EU has funded a number of projects that enable the development of subsystems and adaptors intended to allow MS's to connect and make use of CISE. In this context, the Integrated Systems Laboratory (ISL) has led the development of the corresponding Hellenic and Cypriot CISE by developing a Control, Command & Information (C2I) system that unifies all partial maritime surveillance systems into one National Situational Picture Management (NSPM) system, and adaptors that allow the interconnection of the corresponding national legacy systems to CISE and the exchange of data, information and requests between the two MS's. Furthermore, a set of forensics tools that allow geospatial & time filtering and detection of anomalies, risk incidents, fake MMSIs, suspicious speed changes, collision paths, and gaps in AIS (Automatic Identification System), have been developed by combining motion models, AI, deep learning and fusion algorithms using data from different databases through CISE. This paper briefly discusses these developments within the EU CISE-2020, Hellenic CISE and CY-CISE projects and the benefits from the sharing of maritime data across CISE for both maritime surveillance and security. The prospect of using CISE for the creation of a considerably rich database that could be used for forensics analysis and detection of suspicious maritime traffic and maritime surveillance is discussed.","EU Member States,surveillance,maritime traffic,CY-CISE projects,Maritime Security,Distributed CISE database,Forensics,security of data,maritime security,common information sharing environment,National Situational Picture Management system,Cypriot CISE,MS,deep learning,automatic identification system,marine engineering,Maritime Surveillance,Databases,AIS,CISE,C2I system,Europe,Information management,corresponding national legacy systems,Control,Artificial intelligence,Hellenic CISE,NSPM system,command and control systems,Command,maritime surveillance systems,control-command-information system,national security,fusion algorithms,integrated systems laboratory,ISL,Surveillance,AI,Tools,learning (artificial intelligence),time filtering,forensics tools,"
"a novel model for ship trajectory anomaly detection based on gaussian mixture variational autoencoder","2023","The use of traditional methods in anomaly detection of multi-class ship trajectories showed some limitations in terms of robustness and learning ability of trajectory features. In view of this, an anomaly detection model for ship trajectory data based on Gaussian Mixture Variational Autoencoder (GMVAE) is proposed in this study using an unsupervised classification method. The proposed model modifies Variational Autoencoder (VAE) by changing the inferential distribution of prior distribution and approximate posterior to the Gaussian mixture model. A high-dimensional hidden space is constructed to learn the features of multi-class trajectory data, and the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) method is applied to measure the error between the reconstructed trajectory and the original trajectory in order to judge whether the ship trajectory is abnormal. The Automatic Identification System (AIS) data from the US coastal areas are used to verify the proposed model, and the results are compared with other commonly used models in a manually labeled dataset. The research results indicate that the detection rate of the proposed model is 91.26%, and the false alarm rate is 0.68%, which performs the best. Using the Gaussian mixture model to describe the distribution of hidden space can improve the learning ability of multi-class trajectories of VAE, thus increasing the robustness of the model. This research can provide technical support for ship trajectory data analysis and risk management of maritime transportation.","Trajectory,anomaly detection of ship trajectory,Clustering algorithms,Classification algorithms,Mathematical models,gaussian mixture variational autoencoder (gmvae),unsupervised learning,Gaussian distribution,Marine vehicles,Artificial neural networks,intelligent transportation,AIS,"

"fast and parameter-light rare behavior detection in maritime trajectories","2020","Rare behaviors indicate important events and situations in maritime surveillance applications. State-of-the-art methods provide many effective solutions to detect anomalous behaviors. Meanwhile, most solutions are parameter-laden and too costly to identify useful rare behaviors with human knowledge in a visual analytics manner. This paper is concerned with a scheme cross trajectories, vessel attributes and the movement context for detecting rare behaviors through preprocessing, kNN-based clustering, and verification. Although the scheme involves several parameters, we demonstrate that they are able to be tackled in thresholds. As a result, a rare behavior factor is the single parameter that affect the detecting results. The proposed scheme is evaluated via a simulated data set for performance and a real life AIS data for effectiveness. Results show that high accuracy to labelled anomalies and useful rare behaviors can be achieved.","Rare behaviour detection,Trajectory,Visual analytics,"
"maritime anomaly detection of malicious data spoofing and stealth deviations from nominal route exploiting heterogeneous sources of information","2021","Based on a proper stochastic formulation of the vessel dynamic, exploiting piecewise Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) mean-reverting processes, we propose an effective anomaly detection procedure to jointly reveal Automatic Identification System (AIS) data spoofing and/or surreptitious deviations from the planned route.

"machine learning-assisted anomaly detection in maritime navigation using ais data","2020","The automatic identification system (AIS) reports vessels' static and dynamic information, which are essential for maritime traffic situation awareness. However, AIS transponders can be switched off to hide suspicious activities, such as illegal fishing, or piracy. Therefore, this paper uses real world AIS data to analyze the possibility of successful detection of various anomalies in the maritime domain. We propose a multi-class artificial neural network (ANN)-based anomaly detection framework to classify intentional and non-intentional AIS on-off switching anomalies. The multi-class anomaly framework captures AIS message dropouts due to various reasons, e.g., channel effects or intentional one for carrying illegal activities. We extract position, speed, course and timing information from real world AIS data, and use them to train a 2-class (normal and anomaly) and a 3-class (normal, power outage and anomaly) anomaly detection models. Our results show that the models achieve around 99.9% overall accuracy, and are able to classify a test sample in the order of microseconds.","security of data,maritime traffic situation awareness,multiclass anomaly framework,pattern classification,multiclass artificial neural network,AIS message dropouts,neural nets,illegal fishing,learning (artificial intelligence),illegal activities,ships,automatic identification system,marine engineering,machine learning-assisted anomaly detection,maritime navigation,AIS transponders,"
"unsupervised maritime traffic pattern extraction from spatio-temporal data","2015","Maritime traffic pattern extraction is a fundamental and crucial factor for maritime surveillance and anomaly detection. Emerging technologies like Automatic Identification System (AIS) provides multi-dimensional data which is used to construct a maritime traffic model. In this paper, we propose a framework of maritime traffic pattern extraction from vessel AIS information, which learns a traffic pattern using an unsupervised technique, and can be applied on historical Automatic Identification System data. AIS data is a kind of spatio-temporal data that contains information of location data, as well as time stamps. In this way, traffic pattern is described by AIS data. Furthermore, we conduct a simulation experiment that extracts traffic pattern from the AIS data through the unsupervised technique. The proposed framework takes advantage of AIS data, which is a type of the spatiotemporal data that consists of vessel motion information, to perform the experiment. The result shows that the unsupervised framework converts useful information from raw AIS data to effective traffic pattern. The proposed method strongly supports the further research on maritime traffic pattern extraction of AIS data. Besides, an overview of the framework and the unsupervised technique for high-level maritime situation awareness is presented.","Traffic control,Clustering algorithms,unsupervised learning,anomaly detection,Marine vehicles,vessel AIS information,spatiotemporal data,data analysis,ships,automatic identification system,marine engineering,Automatic Identification System,maritime traffic pattern,AIS,maritime surveillance,Data models,feature extraction,Classification algorithms,identification,Trajectory,maritime situation awareness,maritime traffic pattern extraction,density-based clustering,Data mining,"
"maritime anomaly detection and threat assessment","2010","Ships involved in commercial activities tend to follow set patterns of behaviour depending on the business in which they are engaged. If a ship exhibits anomalous behaviour, this could indicate it is being used for illicit activities. With the wide availability of automatic identification system (AIS) data it is now possible to detect some of these patterns of behaviour. Monitoring the possible threat posed by the worldwide movement of ships, however, requires efficient and robust automatic data processing to create a priority list for further investigation. This paper outlines five anomalous ship behaviours: deviation from standard routes, unexpected AIS activity, unexpected port arrival, close approach, and zone entry. For each behaviour, a process is described for determining the probability that it is anomalous. Individual probabilities are combined using a Bayesian network to calculate the overall probability that a specific threat is present. Examples of how the algorithms work are given using simulated and real data.","Markov processes,white shipping,anomalous ship behaviour,Hidden Markov models,Automatic identification system (AIS),anomaly detection,Bayes methods,Marine vehicles,belief networks,Sea measurements,robust automatic data processing,unexpected port arrival,threat assessment,automatic identification system,marine engineering,Biological system modeling,individual probability,anomalous behaviour,situational awareness,maritime anomaly detection,Tracking,maritime environment,Bayesian network,Probability,AIS activity,security,"
"behaviour analysis and anomaly detection algorithms for the maritime integrated surveillance awareness","2019","The increasing complexity of social-economical activities in the maritime domain is raising new challenges to maritime administrations and agencies from coastal states. These challenges require innovative approaches to support maritime safety and security and, in particular, to promote the sustainable use of the oceans. One solution is to enhance Maritime Situational Awareness (MSA) using systems with high integration and efficient analysis capability. With this problem in mind, the European Commission awarded a grant to a project which aims to develop a framework that will enable a better decision process, by the operators and decision makers, at the maritime operations centers and allowing seamless cooperation between operating authorities and on-site/at sea/in air intervention forces. The project focuses on taking benefits from the data exchange to the next level, while remaining completely integrated in the current European policy. Securing shipping and human lives is of fundamental importance for our continued well-being. The most important way to cost-effectively enhance security and safety at sea is to cooperate at national and international levels.

"interactive visualization of normal behavioral models and expert rules for maritime anomaly detection","2009","Maritime surveillance systems analyze vast amounts of heterogeneous sensor data from a large number of objects. In order to support the operator while monitoring such systems, the identification of anomalous vessels or situations that might need further investigation may reduce the operator's cognitive load. While it is worth acknowledging that many existing mining applications support identification of anomalous behavior, autonomous anomaly detection systems are rarely used in the real world, since the detection of anomalous behavior is normally not a well-defined problem and therefore, human expert knowledge is needed. This calls for the development of interaction components that can support the user in the detection process. In order to support the comprehension of the knowledge embedded in the system, we propose an interactive way of visualizing expert rules and normal behavioral models built from the data. The overall goal is to facilitate the validation and update of these models and signatures, supporting the insertion of human expert knowledge while improving confidence and trust in the system.","embedded systems,surveillance,data mining,human expert knowledge system,National security,anomaly detection,visual analytics,Sensor systems,Monitoring,normal behavioral models,data visualisation,security of data,data analysis,Computer graphics,marine engineering,Humans,autonomous anomaly detection systems,heterogeneous sensor data,Data visualization,expert systems,maritime surveillance systems,interactive visualization,association rules mining,maritime situation awareness,rules/signatures,Object detection,Surveillance,Data mining,AIS data,Data security,embedded system,"

"research on detection mechanism of vessel abnormal behavior based on immune genetic spectral clustering algorithm","2022","Maritime transport accounts for over 90% of global trade, and maritime safety has been confirmed as a vital issue of maritime transport. Accordingly, vessel traffic service system (VTS) is capable of assisting the maritime department to complete real-time supervision of a certain water area and increasing the efficiency of water supervision. However, the VTS system has low effectiveness in vessel anomaly detection and supervision, thus resulting in regulatory blind spot in the VTS system. In this study, a vessel trajectory anomaly detection mechanism is developed using the immune genetic spectral clustering method. Moreover, the contour coefficient of scatter clustering is accurately analyzed, and the clustering center is optimized using the adopted method. On that basis, different abnormal features can be detected, and abnormal detection accuracy can be increased. In this study, the vessel trajectory anomaly detection model is built in accordance with the set sliding window and abnormal threshold parameters of vessel trajectory characteristics. The AIS data of Lianyungang to Qingdao port from March 2021 are selected for experimental analysis. The results suggest that the proposed method outperforms the conventional method in the detection accuracy and the false alarm rate, it facilitates the intelligent and automatic management of vessels by the VTS system.","Immune genetic,Abnormal behavior detection,Automatic identification system (AIS),Spectral clustering,Duplicato-degree measurement,Intelligent vessel supervision,"

"radis: a real-time anomaly detection intelligent system for fault diagnosis of marine machinery","2022","By enhancing data accessibility, the implementation of data-driven models has been made possible to empower strategies in relation to O&M activities. Such models have been extensively applied to perform anomaly detection tasks, with the express purpose of detecting data patterns that deviate significantly from normal operational behaviour. Due to its preeminent importance in the maritime industry to adequately identify the behaviour of marine systems, the Real-time Anomaly Detection Intelligent System (RADIS) framework, constituted by a Long Short-Term Memory-based Variational Autoencoder in tandem with multi-level Otsu’s thresholding, is proposed. RADIS aims to address the current gaps identified within the maritime industry in relation to data-driven model applications for enabling smart maintenance. To assess the performance of such a framework, a case study on a total of 14 parameters obtained from sensors installed on a diesel generator of a tanker ship is introduced to highlight the implementation of RADIS. Results demonstrated the capability of RADIS to be part of a diagnostic analytics tool that will promote the implementation of smart maintenance within the maritime industry, as RADIS detected an average of 92.5% of anomalous instances in the presented case study.","Marine machinery,Deep learning,Intelligent real-time systems,Anomaly detection,Smart maintenance,Ship systems,"

The surveillance area is partitioned by a square grid and the kinematic states that fall inside each cell of the grid are modelled by a Poisson point process.

"detection and geovisualization of abnormal vessel behavior from video","2021","Intelligent maritime situational awareness pursues an effective understanding of the majority of the activities related to the maritime domain (impacting the safety, security, economy, or environment), with the aid of artificial intelligence systems. Such an understanding requires the development of automated processes capable of not only detecting abnormal behavior but also of visually-representing and interpreting it. Although much progress has been made in anomaly detection and visualization using vessel self-reporting positioning data, there have been no corresponding advances using video data, despite the increasing use of cameras for maritime surveillance. In this work, we introduce a framework which goes beyond vessel tracking for anomaly detection in video, and is therefore applicable to scenes with a high density of vessels. The proposed framework detects abnormal behavior using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and interprets this knowledge using metrics derived from clustering the positions and courses provided by an independent vessel/motion detector.

Unfortunately, they can be limited in their ability to model the subtlety and complexity of multiple vessel types and their spatio-temporal events, yet their representation is needed to accurately detect anomalies in maritime scenarios. To address these limitations, we apply plan recognition algorithms for maritime anomaly detection. In particular, we examine hierarchical task network (HTN) and case-based algorithms for plan recognition, which detect anomalies by generating expected behaviors for use as a basis for threat detection. We compare their performance with a behavior recognition algorithm on simulated riverine maritime traffic. On a set of simulated maritime scenarios, these plan recognition algorithms outperformed the behavior recognition algorithm, except for one reactive behavior task in which the inverse occurred. Furthermore, our case-based plan recognizer outperformed our HTN algorithm.

Furthermore, inspired by the rationale of deep learning (DL) aided image processing methods, we first transform the BV assignment problem to a location-based artificial gray value classification problem, and then utilize a convolutional deep belief networks (CDBN) to predict the BV indices from a predefined codebook constituted by location-related feature matrices. In addition, we exploit GAD to rectify the training data of CDBN, such that the prediction on BV assignments can be more accurate to achieve a higher capacity than known methods. Finally, an extensive comparison with selected existing schemes through simulations demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.","Convolutional deep belief network (CDBN),Maritime communication,Deep learning (DL),Massive multiple input multiple output (M-MIMO),Gaussian anomaly detection (GAD),"

A compact representation of this rapidly increasing amount of information gives operational utility to data which would otherwise be ignored. This paper proposes an unsupervised and incremental learning approach to extract the historical traffic patterns from AIS data. The presented methodology called Traffic Route Extraction for Anomaly Detection (TREAD) effectively processes raw AIS data to infer different levels of contextual information, spanning from the identification of ports and off-shore platforms to spatial and temporal distributions of traffic routes. Furthermore, the accurate understanding of the historical traffic enables the classification and prediction of vessel behaviours as well as the detection of low-likelihood behaviours, or anomalies. The ultimate goal is to provide operators with a configurable knowledge framework supporting day by day decision making and general awareness of vessel pattern of life activity. The methodology is demonstrated via a real-world case study, which can be used as a reference data set for further analysis.","data mining,raw AIS data,traffic route extraction for anomaly detection,Vectors,TREAD,unsupervised learning,operational utility,maritime traffic patterns,unsupervised learning approach,incremental learning approach,low-likelihood behaviours,maritime situational awareness,automatic identification system,Knowledge discovery,marine engineering,Entropy,traffic information systems,configurable knowledge framework,traffic knowledge discovery,Trajectory,Receivers,Surveillance,Data mining,historical traffic patterns,"
"maritime situation analysis: a multi-vessel interaction and anomaly detection framework","2014","Maritime security is critical for protecting sea lanes, ports, harborsand other critical infrastructure against a broad range of threats and illegal activities like smuggling, human trafficking, piracy and terrorism. Limited resources constrain maritime domain awareness and compromise full security coverage at all times. This situation calls for innovative intelligent systems for interactive situation analysis to assist marine authorities and security personal in their routine surveillance operations. In this paper, we propose a novel situation analysis approach to analyze, detect and differentiate a range of interaction patterns and anomalies of interest for marine vessels that operate over some period of time in relative proximity to each other. We analyze vessel interaction scenarios to model common patterns as probabilistic processes in terms of hidden Markov models. To differentiate suspicious activities from unobjectionable behavior, we explore fusion of data and information from observable behavior (geospatial aspects, kinematic features and contextual information) and maritime domain knowledge from diverse sources.

"a novelty detection approach to diagnosing hull and propeller fouling","2019","Hull and propeller performance have a primary role in overall vessel efficiency. Vessel fouling is a common phenomenon where undesirable substances attach or grow on the ship hull. A clear understanding of the extent of the degradation of the hull will allow better management of assets and prediction of the best time for dry docking and hull maintenance work. In this paper, the authors investigate the problems of predicting the hull condition in real operations based on data measured by the on-board systems. The proposed solution uses an unsupervised Machine Learning (ML) modelling technique to eliminate the need for collecting labeled data related to the hull and propeller fouling condition. Two anomaly detection methods based on Support Vector Machines and k-nearest neighbour have been applied to predict the hull condition using the available parameters measured on-board. Data from the Research Vessel The Princess Royal has been exploited to show the effectiveness of the proposed methods and to benchmark them in a realistic maritime application.","Data analytics,Hull and propeller performance,Sensor data collection,Supervised learning,Hull fouling detection,Ship efficiency,"

"discovering maritime traffic route from ais network","2016","The recent build-up network of Automatic Identification System (AIS) equipped on vessels provides a rich source of vessel movement information. AIS is originally designed for automatically exchanging navigation information, such as their unique identification, position, course, and speed, with nearby vessels and terrestrial receivers to affect collision avoidance and safety control. The collected sequences of AIS logs can be considered as maritime trajectory data, i.e., the sequences of location points with timestamps. This vast amount of AIS trajectory data can be collected and employed to achieve an awareness of maritime traffic knowledge. This paper is devoted to discovery of maritime traffic route from trajectory data generated by AIS networks. However, AIS trajectory data discovery is a challenging task because of the trajectory data is available with uncertainty. Furthermore, unlike the vehicles' movements are constrained by road networks, there is no such a sea route for vessels to follow in marine areas. To overcome the challenges, we propose a framework of Maritime Traffic Route Discovery (abbreviated as MTRD) to generate pattern-aware routes to achieve an effective understanding of maritime traffic awareness. The proposed framework is evaluated on real AIS data and the experimental results shows that the proposed MTRD is able to extract the marine traffic route effectively and provides a cornerstone of maritime traffic knowledge for traffic management, anomaly detection, and conflict analysis in the future.","data mining,MTRD,AIS trajectory data discovery,terrestrial receivers,anomaly detection,AIS logs,traffic management,marine navigation,Global Positioning System,vessel movement information,Trajectory pattern mining,Trajectory data,Electronic mail,AIS network,maritime traffic knowledge,automatic identification system,marine safety,location point sequences,maritime trajectory data,Artificial intelligence,safety control,vehicle movements,maritime traffic route discovery,Roads,Trajectory,Uncertainty,traffic engineering computing,AIS trajectory data,AIS System,Maritime Traffic knowledge,automatic navigation information exchange,collision avoidance,conflict analysis,Data mining,maritime traffic awareness,Traffic Route Discovery,"

"ship speed power performance under relative wind profiles in relation to sensor fault detection","2018","Statistical data analysis and visualization approaches to identify ship speed power performance under relative wind (i.e. apparent wind) profiles are considered in this study. Ship performance and navigation data of a selected vessel are analyzed, where various data anomalies, i.e. sensor related erroneous data conditions, are identified. Those erroneous data conditions are investigated and several approaches to isolate such situations are also presented by considering appropriate data visualization methods. Then, the cleaned data are used to derive various relationships among ship performance and navigation parameters that have been visualized in this study, appropriately. The results show that the wind profiles along ship routes can be used to evaluate vessel performance and navigation conditions by assuming the respective sea states relate to their wind conditions. Hence, the results are useful to derive appropriate mathematical models that represent ship performance and navigation conditions. Such mathematical models can be used for weather routing type applications (i.e. voyage planning), where the respective weather forecast can be used to derive optimal ship routes to improve vessel performance and reduce fuel consumption. This study presents not only an overview of statistical data analysis of ship performance and navigation data but also the respective challenges in data anomalies (i.e. erroneous data intervals and sensor faults) due to onboard sensors and data handling systems. Furthermore, the respective solutions to such challenges in data quality have also been presented by considering data visualization approaches.","Speed power performance,Data anomaly detection,Sensor fault identification,Weather routing,Ship wind profile,Statistical data analysis,"

This is achieved by modeling the anomaly as a switching unknown control input which goes into action by modifying the expected dynamics of a target and ceases its activity (becomes nonexistent) under nominal behavior. Random Finite Sets (RFS) make it possible to represent the switching nature of the object anomalous behavior and derive a hybrid Bernoulli filter (HBF) that sequentially updates the joint posterior density of a Bernoulli RFS for the unknown velocity input and the object kinematic state. In addition, the proposed HBF has been customized for maritime anomaly detection by using a piecewise Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) stochastic process as dynamic model of vessels.

"a contextual hybrid model for vessel movement prediction","2021","Predicting the movement of the vessels can significantly improve the management of safety. While the movement can be a function of geographic contexts, the current systems and methods rarely incorporate contextual information into the analysis. This paper initially proposes a novel context-aware trajectoriesâ€™ simplification method to embed the effects of geographic context which guarantees the logical consistency of the compressed trajectories, and further suggests a hybrid method that is built upon a curvilinear model and deep neural networks. The proposed method employs contextual information to check the logical consistency of the curvilinear method and then, constructs a Context-aware Long Short-Term Memory (CLSTM) network that can take into account contextual variables, such as the vessel types. The proposed method can enhance the prediction accuracy while maintaining the logical consistency, through a recursive feedback loop. The implementations of the proposed approach on the Automatic Identification System (AIS) dataset, from the eastern coast of the United States of America which was collected, from November to December 2017, demonstrates the effectiveness and better compression, i.e. 80% compression ratio while maintaining the logical consistency. The estimated compressed trajectories are 23% more similar to their original trajectories compared to currently used simplification methods.

"intelligent anomaly detection of trajectories for iot empowered maritime transportation systems","2023","The convergence of Maritime Transportation Systems (MTS) and Internet of Things (IoT) has led to the promising IoT-empowered MTS (IoT-MTS). However, abnormal trajectories of maritime transportation ships can have highly negative impacts on the management of IoT-MTS. Therefore, anomaly detection of trajectories is important for the successful deployment of IoT-MTS. In this paper, we propose a Transfer Learning based Trajectory Anomaly Detection strategy, named TLTAD, for IoT-MTS. Specifically, a variational autoencoder is used to discover the potential connections between each dimension of the normal trajectory, while a graph variational autoencoder is used to explore the spatial similarity between normal trajectories. Based on internal connection of trajectories, a deep reinforcement learning algorithm, Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic policy gradient (TD3), is employed to train the trajectory anomaly detection model. To reduce the model training time, transfer learning is used to migrate the trained anomaly detection model between different regions of an ocean area or between similar ocean areas. Moreover, an efficient data transformation module is designed to improve the efficiency of model transfer. The experiments were conducted on a real-world automatic identification system (AIS) dataset.

This paper proposes the usage of a recurrent neural network (RNN)-based evidential regression model, which can predict trajectory at future timesteps as well as estimate the data and model uncertainties associated, to detect anomalous maritime trajectories, such as unusual vessel maneuvering, using automatic identification system (AIS) data. Furthermore, we utilize evidential deep learning classifiers to detect unusual turns of vessels and the loss of transmitted signal using predicted class probabilities with associated uncertainties.

"airborne maritime surveillance using magnetic anomaly detection signature","2020","For an airborne sensor, there is a pressing need to be able to detect/track submerged submarines, shipwrecks, sea mines, unexploded explosive ordnance, and buried drums during maritime surveillance.

The primary means of long-range detection and classification of targets are with passive and active acoustic sensors, and MAD is used for accurate final localization. MAD could also be used for land-based targets but this is not common. Knowing the relationship between the magnetic signature and the kinematic parameters, the tracking problem can be formulated under a Bayesian framework.

"contextual verification for false alarm reduction in maritime anomaly detection","2015","Automated vessel anomaly detection is immensely important for preventing and reducing illegal activities (e.g., drug dealing, human trafficking, etc.) and for effective emergency response and rescue in a country's territorial waters. A major limitation of previously proposed vessel anomaly detection techniques is the high rate of false alarms as these methods mainly consider vessel kinematic information which is generally obtained from AIS data. In many cases, an anomalous vessel in terms of kinematic data can be completely normal and legitimate if the 'context' at the location and time (e.g., weather and sea conditions) of the vessel is factored in. In this paper, we propose a novel anomalous vessel detection framework that utilizes such contextual information to reduce false alarms through 'contextual verification'. We evaluate our proposed framework for vessel anomaly detection using massive amount of real-life AIS data sets obtained from U.S. Coast Guard. Though our study and developed prototype is based on the maritime domain the basic idea of using contextual information through 'contextual verification' to filter false alarms can be applied to other domains as well.","Kinematics,AIS Data,emergency management,vessel kinematic information,Contextual Verification,Trajectory Clustering,Anomaly Detection,contextual verification,US coast guard,Meteorology,False Alarm Reduction,illegal activities,marine engineering,automated vessel anomaly detection,false alarms,Big data,contextual information,Context,false alarm reduction,maritime anomaly detection,Real-time systems,emergency response,Tracking,Trajectory,territorial waters,AIS data,"

"synthetic trajectory extraction for maritime anomaly detection","2018","In the maritime domain, the main goal for large vessels is to drive as fast and efficiently as possible from one harbour to the next. This results in vessels following quite distinct routes. Deviations from these routes can be seen as indicators for illegal or at least suspicious behaviour. In order to extract these routes, clustering algorithms can be used, that will store the traffic patterns as synthetic trajectories. A vessel can be assigned to a specific route or a deviation from the routes can be detected by evaluating these route models. A challenge in designing the synthetic trajectories lies in the faithful representation, sparsity of data, treatment of outliers and split-up of routes. Here, a novel approach to model the uncertainty of the vessels movements while following a route is introduced: A cluster is now represented by a trajectory consisting of segments.

"on the effectiveness of ai-assisted anomaly detection methods in maritime navigation","2020","The automatic identification system (AIS) has become an essential tool for maritime security. Nevertheless, how to effectively use the static and dynamic voyage information of the AIS data in maritime traffic situation awareness is still a challenge. This paper presents a comparative study of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques on their effectiveness in dealing with various anomalies in maritime domain using the AIS data. The AIS on-off switching (OOS) anomaly is critical in maritime security, since AIS technology is susceptible to manipulation and it can be switched on and off to hide illegal activities. Thus, we try to detect and distinguish between intentional and non-intentional AIS OOS anomalies through our AI -assisted anomaly detection framework. We use AIS data, in particular positional and navigational status of vessels, to study the effectiveness of seven AI techniques, such as artificial neural network, support vector machine, logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, decision tree, random forest and naive Bayes, in detecting the AIS OOS anomalies. Our experimental results show that ANN and SVM are the most suitable techniques in detecting the AIS OOS anomalies with 99.9% accuracy. Interestingly, the ANN model outperforms others when trained with a balanced (i.e., same order of samples per class) dataset, and SVM, on the other hand, is suitable when training dataset is unbalanced.","maritime traffic situation awareness,AI-assisted anomaly detection,decision trees,Support vector machines,logistic regression,Anomaly detection,static voyage information,random forests,ANN,marine navigation,Feature extraction,security of data,maritime security,k-nearest neighbors,regression analysis,AIS technology,naive Bayes,neural nets,naive Bayes methods,automatic identification system,marine safety,marine engineering,support vector machines,maritime navigation,dynamic voyage information,maritime domain,random forest,SVM,Artificial intelligence,AIS on-off switching anomaly,nearest neighbour methods,artificial neural network,Training,Trajectory,support vector machine,nonintentional AIS OOS anomalies,Navigation,artificial intelligence,decision tree,AIS data,"

Anomaly detection is one of many techniques available for improving the safety and security in this domain. Maritime authorities use confidential data sources for monitoring the maritime activities; however, a paradigm shift on the Internet has created new open sources of data. We investigate the potential of using open data as a complementary resource for anomaly detection in maritime surveillance. We present and evaluate a decision support system based on open data and expert rules for this purpose. We conduct a case study in which experts from the Swedish coastguard participate to conduct a real-world validation of the system.

In this paper, we focus on extracting a variety of trajectory patterns for maritime vessels. The first group of analysis we focus on is arrival port, arrival time, and next position prediction on AIS messages, which are useful to aid maritime operators. We propose three different approaches for the prediction of marine vessel movement. As the second type of analysis, anomaly detection on marine vessel trajectory is studied.

"maritime vessel traffic modeling in the context of concept drift","2017","Maritime traffic modeling serves the purpose of extracting human-readable information and discovering knowledge in the otherwise illegible mass of traffic data. The goal of this study is to examine the presence and character of fluctuations in maritime traffic patterns. The main objective is to identify such fluctuations and capture them in terms of a concept drift, i.e., unforeseen shifts in statistical properties of the modeled target occurring over time. The empirical study is based on a collection of AIS vessel tracking data, spanning over a year. The scope of the study limits the AIS data area to the Baltic region (9-31°E, 53-66°N), which experiences some of the most dense maritime traffic in the world. The investigations employ a novel maritime traffic modeling method based on the potential fields concept, adapted for this study to facilitate the examination of concept drift. The concept drift is made apparent in course of the statistical and visual analysis of the experimental results. This study shows a number of particular cases, in which the maritime traffic is affected by concept drifts of varying extent and character. The visual representations of the traffic models make shifts in the traffic patterns apparent and comprehensible to human eye. Based on the experimental outcomes, the robustness of the modeling method against concept drift in traffic is discussed and improvements are proposed. The outcomes provide insights into regularly reoccurring drifts and irregularities within the traffic data itself that may serve to further optimize the modeling method, and – in turn – the performance of detection based on it.","maritime traffic,concept drift,traffic modeling,anomaly detection,"

Second, we conduct systematic disciplinary knowledge maps in the field of DASB, which identify evolution, hotspots and emerging trends.

An U.A.V. (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) was used to acquire visible and thermal images over a diurnal cycle (from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m.). The visible images were processed to realize an altimetric model of the platforms by mean of the photogrammetric method, while the thermal infrared (TIR) images were used to study the evolution of their surface temperatures. The obtained 3D model shows the location of five topographic depressions on both quays. The analysis of the evolution of the surface thermal field leads to the detection of cold thermal anomalies that are (1) not correlated to surface properties, and (2) spatially associated to the flanks of the five topographic depressions. Using a 2D conductive-radiative model, we show that these anomalies are not directly due to the thermally insulating effect of an air-filled area. Finally, we conclude that preferential infiltration and subsequent evaporation in the micro-fracturation present within the flanks of the depressions may be responsible for the strong cooling of these zones.","Thermal infrared,Photogrammetry,Remote Sensing,infiltration,Subsurface cavity,Natural hazards,UAV,"

This paper is motivated to apply a semantic analysis method to explore potential mobility patterns from ship trajectories in inland river by combining semantic transformation and topic model. A coarse-grained semantic transformation model is firstly defined to translate each ship trajectory into a document containing a series of sequential motion words. A motion word is generally a synthetic semantic representation of three trajectory features (location, course and speed). All ship trajectories can then be examined and analyzed as a document corpus. A classic topic model (i.e. Latent Dirichlet Allocation, LDA) is employed to explore hidden ship mobility patterns from trajectory document corpus. The effectiveness of this approach is illustrated through a case study at Wuhan waterway, located at middle stream of Yangtze River in China.","Ship mobility pattern,Trajectory analysis,Topic modeling,Automatic identification system,"

Multiple features extracted from radar returns in different domains have ability but not enough to solely distinguish radar returns with target from sea clutter. Joint exploitation of multiple features becomes the key to improve detection performance. In this article, the K-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm and anomaly detection idea are cooperated to develop a novel sea-surface target detection method in the feature space spanned by the eight existing salient features. The detection is realized by the anomaly detection followed by a specially designed KNN-based classifier with a controllable false alarm rate. In the anomaly detection, a decision region is determined by the hyper-spherical coverage of the training set of sea clutter that is sufficient and ergodic in the feature space. The KNN-based classifier is designed based on the training sample set of sea clutter and the training sample set of simulated target returns plus sea clutter that is sufficient but nonergodic, by joint usage of feature weighting, neighbor weighting, and distance weighting. The novel method is validated by the two open and recognized IPIX and CSIR radar databases for sea-surface small target detection. The results show that it provides significant performance improvement in comparison with the existing multiple-feature-based detection methods, owing to the fact that the novel method avoids the dimension restriction and feature compression loss in the existing methods.","k-nearest neighbor algorithm,feature compression loss,IPIX radar databases,marine radar,high-resolution maritime ubiquitous radars,Anomaly detection,radar detection,radar clutter,KNN-based classifier design,anomaly based sea-surface,neighbor algorithm,Feature extraction,sea clutter,radar computing,anomaly detection idea,object detection,feature extraction,CSIR radar databases,weak target return simulation,K-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier with controllable false alarm rate,Radar clutter,feature weighting space,nearest neighbour methods,Training,sea-surface small target detection,Clutter,sea-surface target detection method,Object detection,Anomaly detection framework,multiple-feature-based detection methods,training sample set,Radar detection,"

On the one hand, the DTW trajectory similarity metric is used to obtain a distance between two trajectories. On the other hand, an extraction of features of interest from each trajectory allowing a summary of the trajectory in a single multidimensional instance.

"potential impact of long-life environmental sonobuoys on littoral asw","2009","The focus of military activity has recently shifted from large area engagements to regional conflicts. Consequently, supportive Naval maritime operations have continued to evolve toward littoral warfare in complicated shallow-water, near-shore environments. This evolution requires new sensors, advanced Concept of Operations, and improved data-analysis capabilities, among others. Planning operations in these harsh-environment areas is difficult because accurate predictions of tactical sensor performance depend on detailed knowledge of the local environmental conditions. Tactical mission planning is thus seldom optimal or efficient, often resulting in coverage gaps, increased risk, and reduced mission success. According to a Navy Mission Need Statement, 'Air ASW tactical execution, especially in littoral seas, requires in-situ environmental updates for preflight mission planning. In the conduct of ASW operations, an urgent need for explicit knowledge of environmental variables is required to optimize the effectiveness of operational acoustic sensors, as well as acoustic sensors in development ' The Naval Air Systems Command has considered extended-life environmental sonobuoy concepts to better characterize the littoral environment. Most designs contain a thermistor string to measure ocean temperatures and also hydrophones to measure ambient noise. This type of complex sonobuoy would be more expensive than a traditional single-measurement AXBT but it could provide a more thorough littoral environment assessment. This paper examines the trade-off between increased sensor complexity and improved ASW performance, in terms of cumulative detection probability. Some advantages of an extended-life combined thermistor string/hydrophone approach, compared to AXBTs and tactical hydrophones, are: 1) higher accuracy of the raw data; 2) temporal averaging to smooth out fluctuations; 3) extended area coverage during drift; 4) less chance for surface temperature anomalies (e.g., mixed-layer-depth errors) caused by various electronic and mechanical variability upon impact; 5) opportunities to discover thermal and acoustic feature boundaries during drift; and 6) less need to re-seed thus allowing longer tactical mission times. These advantages are evaluated relative to the following disadvantages: 1) increased cost; 2) potential drift outside the mission area; and 3) need for increased battery life for longer durations. The analysis is tempered by considering how a potential new system might be used. One assumption is that an environmental sampling decision aid is available to determine the minimum number and best initial locations of drifting sensors to meet performance objectives. The November 2007 Requirements Document from the Naval Oceanographic Office states ?Sampling guidance: Development of guidance on the best way to deploy, spatially and temporally, observation systems in order to meet various forecasting, model assimilation, and model evaluation objectives is needed.? Work in this area is reported in this Oceans '09 Conference in a paper entitled ?Uncertainty-based Adaptive AXBT Sampling with SPOTS?, which addresses optimal sampling requirements. For this trade-off analysis, temperature data from watersampling flights in the Sea of Japan off the east coast of Korea were used to simulate expected capability of a long-term drifting thermistor string. Then optimal initial positions for three notional buoys were determined followed by a simulation of drifting positions and data collected over 12 days. Ocean nowcasts were constructed and used to determine acoustic performance of a notional tactical sonobuoy field. The analysis shows that a drifting extended-life thermistor string can provide significant improvement in environmental characterization, tactical planning, and ASW detection performance.","Acoustic measurements,Sea measurements,military systems,Predictive models,Sonar equipment,Sampling methods,Ocean temperature,Noise measurement,littoral ASW,operational acoustic sensors,Thermistors,Temperature measurement,Acoustic sensors,long-life environmental sonobuoys,"

"effects of persistence and large-scale climate anomalies on trends and change points in extreme precipitation of canada","2017","Slowly varying (trend) and abrupt (change points) changes in annual maximum daily precipitation (AMP) and seasonal maximum daily precipitation (SMP) across Canada for 223 stations in six regions during four periods (1900–2010, 1930–2010, 1950–2010 and 1970–2010) were analyzed. Variants of the Mann-Kendall (MK) test considering influences of short-term persistence (STP), long-term persistence (LTP) and large-scale climate anomalies on trend detection were applied to detect trends, and the Pettitt test was used to evaluate change points. The results indicate that there was a mix of increasing and decreasing trends for Canadian AMPs and SMPs. Most regions in Pacific Maritime, central Boreal regions and the Atlantic Maritime showed an increase in AMP, while a decrease in Canadian Prairies and most Boreal regions. More stations showing statistically significant increases than decreases in spring, summer and autumn SMPs were found while there was a statistically significant decrease (increase) in winter SMP over southern (northern) Canada. LTP significantly increased the likelihood of trends detected in AMPs and SMPs. The effects of STP on the trend detection were also evident as shown by the differences in results obtained from the MK tests with and without considering the effect of STP. The effects of large-scale climate anomalies on trends were significant for winter SMPs. More than 1/4 of stations were detected with statistically significant change points in AMPs and SMPs which occurred around 1960–1990. More stations showed significant change points than trends, and winter showed more evident trends and change points in SMPs than other three seasons.

"incipient anomalous ionospheric divergence fast detection for coastal differential global navigation satellite system","2023","Differential Global Navigation Satellite System (DGNSS) plays an increasingly important role in the maritime field. Irregular ionospheric divergences may result in DGNSS performance degradation and increase risk in terms of positioning accuracy and navigation integrity. To speed up incipient ionospheric anomaly detection, this paper proposes a novel method for the DGNSS stations which employs (1) the Wasserstein distance (WD) to identify dissimilarity between GNSS pseudorange and carrier-phase measurements and (2) the least-mean-square (LMS) filter to smooth the calculated metrics. The combined WD-LMS is proposed to ensure the rapid identification of abnormal ionospheric divergences. Taking the multipath into account, which is especially severe in the low elevation angle case, elevation-angle related strategies are developed. Both semi-simulated and real experiments are conducted. For the high-elevation angle case, the WD-LMS is even potential to detect large ionospheric divergences within ten epochs. Therefore, the WD-LMS has encouraging potential to enhance maritime DGNSS navigation performance.","DGNSS,Marine navigation,Ionospheric divergences,"
"efficient on-line anomaly detection for ship systems in operation","2019","We propose novel modifications to an anomaly detection methodology based on multivariate signal reconstruction followed by residuals analysis. The reconstructions are made using Auto Associative Kernel Regression (AAKR), where the query observations are compared to historical observations called memory vectors, representing normal operation. When the data set with historical observations grows large, the naive approach where all observations are used as memory vectors will lead to unacceptable large computational loads, hence a reduced set of memory vectors should be intelligently selected. The residuals between the observed and the reconstructed signals are analysed using standard Sequential Probability Ratio Tests (SPRT), where appropriate alarms are raised based on the sequential behaviour of the residuals. The modifications we introduce include: a novel cluster based method to select memory vectors to be considered by the AAKR, which gives an extensive reduction in computation time; a generalization of the distance measure, which makes it possible to distinguish between explanatory and response variables; and a regional credibility estimation used in the residuals analysis, to let the time used to identify if a sequence of query vectors represents an anomalous state or not, depend on the amount of data situated close to or surrounding the query vector. We demonstrate how the anomaly detection method and the proposed modifications can be successfully applied for anomaly detection on a set of imbalanced benchmark data sets, as well as on recent data from a marine diesel engine in operation.","Cluster based AAKR,Maritime industry,Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT),Anomaly detection,Auto Associative Kernel Regression (AAKR),Condition monitoring,"

"online fault detection in autonomous ferries: using fault-type independent spectral anomaly detection","2020","Enthusiasm for ship autonomy is flourishing in the maritime industry. In this context, data-driven prognostics and health management (PHM) systems have emerged as the optimal way to improve operational reliability and system safety. However, further research is needed to enhance the essential actions relating to such a system. Fault detection is the first and most crucial action of any data-driven PHM system. In this article, we propose a fault-type independent spectral anomaly detection algorithm for marine diesel engine degradation in autonomous ferries. The benefits of the algorithm are verified on three fault types where the nature of degradation differs. Both normal operation data and faulty degradation data have been collected from a marine diesel engine using two different engine load profiles. These profiles aim to replicate real autonomous ferry crossing operations, environmental conditions that the ferry may encounter. First, the data are subjected to a feature selection process to remove irrelevant and redundant features. Then, a multiregime normalization method is performed on the data to merge the engine loads into one context. Finally, a variational autoencoder is trained to estimate velocity and acceleration calculations of the anomaly score. Generic and dynamic threshold limits are simultaneously established to detect the fault time step online. The algorithm achieved an accuracy of 97.66% in the final test when the acceleration was used as the fault detector. The results suggest that the algorithm is independent of fault types with different nature of degradation related to the marine diesel engine.","operational reliability,generic threshold limit,acceleration calculation,fault-type independent spectral anomaly detection algorithm,variational autoencoder,engine loads,Anomaly detection,fault detector,reliability,multiregime normalization,Acceleration,ship autonomy,prognostics and health management (PHM),neural nets,Autonomous ferry,autonomous ferry crossing operations,system safety,data analysis,marine systems,ships,marine diesel engine degradation,Prognostics and health management,prognostics and health management system,online fault detection,dynamic threshold limit,Diesel engines,data-driven PHM system,mechanical engineering computing,feature selection,feature selection process,diesel engines,Fault detection,condition monitoring,Degradation,environmental conditions,marine diesel engine,maritime industry,failure analysis,Heuristic algorithms,multiregime normalization method,fault diagnosis,velocity calculation,faulty degradation data,"

"framework for ship trajectory forecasting based on linear stationary models using automatic identification system","2022","Maritime surveillance is of utmost priority for a nation's security, and hence it's economy. For maritime awareness, coastal surveillance, and maritime activities in the Region of Interest (ROI) should be monitored. One of the ways to keep this in check is to restrain unwanted infiltration. Monitoring unwanted infiltration is feasible through vessel trajectory forecasting and anomaly detection in real time. Most solutions for trajectory predictions are available but require a huge amount of historical data, and high-power computing resources. Here, the requirement is developing a decision support framework consisting of both lite weight approaches for short-term predictions and deep learning-based techniques for long-term forecasting. This paper aims to find the suitability of Linear Stationary Models (LSM) like the Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average Model (ARIMA) for predicting and forecasting the Vessel Trajectory as means of lite weight short-term predictions. For this purpose, the Automatic Identification System (AIS) dataset of the U.S. West Coast is used. The significant effort was for data pre-processing to create a robust dataset for model training. An appropriate model after the model-selection process is used for trajectory forecasting. The model's accuracy is validated using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) performance indices for residual and forecast errors. A window generator model is integrated with the best-fitted ARIMA model for recursive real-time predictions, with varied sizes and visualization. The proposed time-series model provided a very high accuracy as the RMSE value for prediction and 48 hours forecast are 0.023 and 0.017, respectively.","Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average Model,Window Generator,Trajectory Forecast,Time Series Analysis,Automatic Identification System,Maritime Surveillance,"

"hybrid bernoulli filtering for detection and tracking of anomalous path deviations","2018","This paper presents a solution to the problem of sequential joint anomaly detection and tracking of a target subject to switching unknown path deviations. Based on a dynamic model described by Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) stochastic processes, the anomaly is represented by a target (e.g., a marine vessel) that deviates from a preset route by changing its nominal mean velocity. The Random Finite Set (RFS) framework is used to represent the switching nature of target's anomalous behavior in the presence of spurious measurements and detection uncertainty. Combining these two ingredients, the problem of jointly detecting target's path deviations and estimating its kinematic state can be formulated within the Bayesian framework, and analytically solved by means of a hybrid Bernoulli filter that sequentially updates the joint posterior density of the unknown OU velocity input (a Bernoulli RFS) and of the target's state random vector. We illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed filter, implemented in Gaussian-mixture form, in a simulated scenario of vessel tracking for maritime traffic monitoring.","Anomaly detection,switching nature,state random vector,Sea measurements,Stochastic processes,Radio frequency,vessel tracking,hybrid Bernoulli filtering,target tracking,Random Finite Set framework,stochastic processes,filtering theory,hybrid Bernoulli filter,Target tracking,object detection,Gaussian processes,Bayesian framework,Artificial intelligence,anomalous path deviations,unknown OU velocity input,nominal mean velocity,Surveillance,marine vessel,joint posterior density,sequential joint anomaly detection,"

Traditionally, this data feed has been used by vessel traffic services to avoid vessel collisions, however increasingly, marine researchers and data scientists have shown interest in developing algorithms on historical AIS data-dumps with diverse objectives such as estimating trends in global ocean-currents, maritime logistical planning, fishing fleet monitoring and enhancing maritime security. This paper aims to propose a novel shipping-route extraction algorithm to process historical AIS data (running into tens of gigabytes of daily data, from more than a hundred thousand maritime vessels), to effectively characterize global shipping route behaviour and capture its seasonal trends. This is done by formulating a sigmoid based turning waypoint identification, which does not solely depend on the change in the course of a vessel, derived from AIS message. The AIS data is further processed to excerpt the vesselâ€™s distance from the nearest port and nearest shore with resolution of about 1 km, which forms a handy metric for the identification of suspicious ports. Several other use cases are also explored, which include detecting various anomalies in individual vessel behaviour such as intentional or unintentional switching off AIS transmission, shipping-lane deviations, spoofing transmission messages. To tackle spoofing anomaly, various spoofing identification methods are discussed. A region-based spoofing identification algorithm is developed to identify spoofing points under multiple categories using a clustering algorithm.

"a context-aware approach for vessels’ trajectory prediction","2023","An accurate vessel trajectory prediction can improve safety management at sea. Although the vessels' trajectories can be affected by complex and high dimensional context factors such as wind, wave size, and current, the research in incorporating them in trajectory prediction is still burgeoning. This paper proposes a context-aware data-driven framework for vessel trajectory prediction. In this regard, trajectories are enriched with context information at the first stage. This includes evaluating methods of trajectory annotation. Next, feature selection techniques are applied to solve the problems caused by high dimensionality, i.e., incensement in the complexity and the computational load. Finally, selected factors are used in a Context-aware Long Short-Term Memory (CLSTM) network. The implementations on the Automatic Identification System (AIS), weather, and ocean condition dataset around the English Channel collected during February 2016, indicated that the spline interpolation is suitable for trajectory annotation. Water depth, wave direction, and height are the most influencing context in vessels’ data-driven movement prediction. The predictions made by the proposed framework are 15.31% more accurate than the prediction of a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. Therefore, the proposed context-aware trajectory prediction framework might suit maritime systems and applications like collision avoidance, vessel route planning, and anomaly detection.",""

"a novel anomaly detection approach to identify intentional ais on-off switching","2017","The Automatic Identification System (AIS) is a ship reporting system based on messages broadcast by vessels carrying an AIS transponder. The recent increase of terrestrial networks and satellite constellations of receivers is making AIS one of the main sources of information for Maritime Situational Awareness activities. Nevertheless, AIS is subject to reliability and manipulation issues; indeed, the received reports can be unintentionally incorrect, jammed or deliberately spoofed. Moreover, the system can be switched off to cover illicit operations, causing the interruption of AIS reception. This paper addresses the problem of detecting whether a shortage of AIS messages represents an alerting situation or not, by exploiting the Received Signal Strength Indicator available at the AIS Base Stations (BS). In designing such an anomaly detector, the electromagnetic propagation conditions that characterize the channel between ship AIS transponders and BS have to be taken into consideration. The first part of this work is thus focused on the experimental investigation and characterisation of coverage patterns extracted from the real historical AIS data. In addition, the paper proposes an anomaly detection algorithm to identify intentional AIS on-off switching. The presented methodology is then illustrated and assessed on a real-world dataset.","Maritime surveillance,Automatic Identification System (AIS),Anomaly detection,Knowledge-based systems,Maritime Situational Awareness,Received Signal Strength Indicator,"
"data mining approach to shipping route characterization and anomaly detection based on ais data","2020","A data mining approach is presented for probabilistic characterization of maritime traffic and anomaly detection. The approach automatically groups historical traffic data provided by the Automatic Identification System in terms of ship types, sizes, final destinations and other characteristics that influence the maritime traffic patterns off the continental coast of Portugal. The approach consists of identifying relevant waypoints along a route where significant changes in the ships’ navigational behaviour are observed, such as changes in heading, using trajectory compression and clustering algorithms. This provides a vector-based representation of the ship routes consisting of straight legs and connecting turning sections that facilitates route probabilistic characterization and anomaly detection. The maritime traffic is characterized probabilistically at the identified route legs and waypoints in terms of lateral distribution of the trajectories and speed profile, which allows the characterization of the typical behaviour of a group of similar ships along a particular route. In the proposed approach heading changes are automatically detected using the Douglas and Peucker algorithm and clustered by the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise algorithm. The proposed method is applied to the characterization of southbound maritime traffic from the traffic separation scheme off Cape Roca to the ports of Lisbon, Setúbal and Sines. Finally, an example of ship trajectory anomaly detection based on the developed maritime traffic probabilistic models is provided.","Traffic characterization,Maritime traffic,Anomaly detection,Data mining,AIS data,"

"bayesian filtering for dynamic anomaly detection and tracking","2022","This article presents a Bayesian approach for sequential detection of anomalies in the motion of a target and joint tracking. The anomaly is modeled as a binary (on/off) switching unknown control input that goes into action (begins to exist, or â€œswitches onâ€) thereby modifying the object dynamics; and by ceasing its activity (becoming nonexistent, or â€œswitching offâ€) returns the dynamics to nominal. The developed Bayesian framework brings together random finite set (RFS) theory to represent the switching nature of the anomaly, and optimal joint input and state estimation to sequentially update a hybrid state that incorporates a random vector for the kinematic state and a Bernoulli RFS for the unknown control input. In addition, a closed-form solution, the Gaussian-mixture hybrid Bernoulli filter (GM-HBF), has been developed to provide a customized solution for dynamic anomaly detection in the maritime domain characterized by linear Gaussian target dynamics. Based on the Ornsteinâ€“Uhlenbeck dynamic model for vessels, where the evolution of the object velocity is governed by a piecewise mean-reverting stochastic process, the anomaly can be represented by a change in the long-run mean velocity (i.e., the unknown control input) from the nominal condition that forces the vessel to deviate from its standard route. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed GM-HBF in both simulated and real-world maritime surveillance applications and test its performance in the face of false measurements, detection uncertainty, and sensor data gaps.","developed Bayesian framework,surveillance,kinematic state,Mathematical models,Anomaly detection,Automatic identification system (AIS),Bayesian approach,random finite sets (RFSs),Bayesian filtering,Bayes methods,object dynamics,linear Gaussian target dynamics,Switches,Bernoulli filter,switching unknown control input,Radio frequency,target tracking,Aerodynamics,stochastic processes,filtering theory,radar,state estimation,detection uncertainty,Gaussian processes,Bernoulli RFS,Radar tracking,maritime anomaly detection,dynamic anomaly detection,joint input and state estimation (JISE),probability,Ornstein-Uhlenbeck dynamic model,GM-HBF,Gaussian-mixture hybrid Bernoulli filter,"

"context-enhanced vessel prediction based on ornstein-uhlenbeck processes using historical ais traffic patterns: real-world experimental results","2014","Traffic route analysis and prediction are both essential for maritime security. Specifically, the prediction of a vessel position is useful to provide alerts about upcoming events (e.g., opportunities and threats). However, accurate prediction along a route in the maritime domain is a challenging task, due to the complex and dynamic nature of traffic patterns. This paper presents a vessel prediction method, based on the popular Ornstein-Uhlenbeck stochastic processes, whose parameters are estimated from historical patterns of life. The historical traffic routes are obtained by pre-processing Automatic Identification System (AIS) data via the CMRE tool called Traffic Route Extraction for Anomaly Detection (TREAD). These recurrent routes allow prediction of the position of a vessel that is following one of these routes, surprisingly, by several hours. The method is validated using a case study related to the second data campaign of the EC FP7 Project New Service Capabilities for Integrated and Advanced Maritime Surveillance (NEREIDS)1. We demonstrate that the prediction accuracy is well represented by the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model.","surveillance,New Service Capabilities for Integrated and Advanced Maritime Surveillance,anomaly detection,security of data,Stochastic processes,Predictive models,Transmitters,historical AIS traffic pattern,vessel position prediction uncertainty,context enhanced vessel prediction method,NEREIDS,automatic identification system,CMRE tool,stochastic processes,marine engineering,Target tracking,maritime domain,Radar tracking,Real-time systems,Ornstein-Uhlenbeck stochastic process,traffic route extraction,traffic engineering computing,parameter estimation,Data mining,traffic route analysis,EC FP7 Project,"

"predictive maintenance leveraging machine learning for time-series forecasting in the maritime industry","2020","One of the key challenges in the maritime industry refers to minimizing the time a vessel cannot be utilized, which has multiple effects. The latter is addressed through maintenance approaches that however in many cases are not efficient in terms of cost and downtime. Predictive maintenance provides optimized maintenance scheduling offering extended vessel lifespan, coupled with reduced maintenance costs. As in several industries, including the maritime domain, an increasing amount of data is made available through the deployment and exploitation of data sources, such as on board sensors that provide real-time information. These data provide the required ground for analysis and thus support for various types of data-driven decision making. In the maritime domain, sensors are deployed on vessels to monitor their engines and data analysis tools are needed to assist engineers towards reduced operational risk through predictive maintenance solutions that are put in place. In this paper, we present an approach for anomaly detection on time-series data, utilizing machine learning on the vessels sensor data, in order to predict the condition of specific parts of the vessel's main engine and thus facilitate predictive maintenance.

A vast majority of research focuses on anomalous vessel behaviour detection from Automated Identification System (AIS) data, using artificial intelligence (AI), Bayesian networks and machine learning based methods. AIS is a cooperative system that employs VHF transceivers to share vessel information through terrestrial and satellite communication networks. To track small boats not fitted with AIS, uncooperative surveillance systems are employed. These systems have been studied in a relatively small number of publications. In vessel behaviour pattern recognition, target classification is critically important, particularly, in asymmetric warfare situations. The paper concludes with a discussion of future outlook in vessel behaviour pattern recognition research.","Vessel behaviour recognition,Target tracking,Pattern of life,Anomaly detection,Plan recognition,Bayesian networks,Target classification,"
"psr-based feature adaptation with anomaly re-prediction for maritime target tracking","2022","The tracking method for the relevant filter cannot track when the target is affected by the background and in the scene of occlusion. We propose a target tracking algorithm based on the peak-to-sidelobe ratio (PSR) feature weight adaptation with anomaly re-detection based on the efficient convolution operator for manual features (ECO_HC) algorithm. The weights of the HOG features and CN features corresponding to the peak-to-sidelobe ratio are used as dynamic weight coefficients, and the maximum response value after their fusion is the area where the target may appear. Determine the target tracking status by calculating the tracking confidence of the response map, and when there is a tracking anomaly, the ECO_HC tracker is enhanced using the Kalman filter to re-predict the target position. The proposed algorithm has experimented on the OTB-50 dataset. The results show that our algorithm can cope with complex scenarios and improves by 3.0% in tracking accuracy and 2.8% in tracking success rate compared with the baseline algorithm ECO_HC.

"augmented ship tracking under occlusion conditions from maritime surveillance videos","2020","Ship tracking provides crucial on-site microscopic kinematic traffic information which benefits maritime traffic flow analysis, ship safety enhancement, traffic control, etc., and thus has attracted considerable research attentions in the maritime surveillance community. Conventional ship tracking methods yield satisfied results by exploring distinct visual ship features in maritime images, which may fail when the target ship is partially or fully sheltered by obstacles (e.g., ships, waves, etc.) in maritime videos. To overcome the difficulty, we propose an augmented ship tracking framework via the kernelized correlation filter (KCF) and curve fitting algorithm. First, the KCF model is introduced to track ships in the consecutive maritime images and obtain raw ship trajectory dataset. Second, the data anomaly detection and rectification procedure are implemented to rectify the contaminated ship positions.

"routeminer: mining ship routes from a massive maritime trajectories","2014","Mining trajectory data has been attracting significant interest in the last years. By analyzing trajectory data, we are able to discover the movement behavior and location-aware knowledge, and then develop many interesting applications such as movement behavior discovery, location prediction, traffic analysis, and so on. However, trajectory data mining is a challenge task because of the trajectory data is available with uncertainty. Furthermore, discovering the valuable knowledge from maritime trajectory is made even more difficult due to the maritime area is a free moving space. Unlike the vehicles' movements are constrained by road networks, there is no such a sea route for ships to follow in maritime area. A ship's movement may not exactly repeat the same trajectory even the ship has the similar movement behavior with others. In this work, Route Miner system provides a framework of ship route mining for maritime traffic analysis. Given a set of ship trajectories in a maritime area, Route Miner explore the movement behavior from those massive trajectories in a free moving space. Then, ship routes are detected based on those behavioral pattern. Finally, the system generates a set of ships routes to provide operators a better understanding from ship trajectory data. We conduct the experiments on real maritime trajectories to show the effectiveness of proposed Route Miner. In the future, Route Miner is going to serve as the photo type for exploring the solutions of the challenges those related to anomaly detection and traffic management in the maritime domain.","data mining,Vectors,movement behavior,anomaly detection,Marine vehicles,movement behavior discovery,traffic management,ship trajectories,Trajectory Data Mining,mining ship routes,ship route mining,Ship Route Mining,marine systems,maritime trajectories,Vehicles,trajectory data analysis,route miner system,Maritime Trajectory,trajectory data mining,maritime domain,behavioral pattern,maritime traffic analysis,Roads,location prediction,Trajectory,massive maritime trajectories,Uncertainty,road networks,Data mining,maritime area,location-aware knowledge,"

"outlier detection approach for discovering anomalous maritime profiles","2023","Maritime authorities play a key role in ensuring the safety and security of shipping lanes and ports. The port state control mechanism enables these authorities to physically verify suspect vessels (e.g., involved in smuggling or piracy events), but choosing the most relevant vessels to be inspected represents a challenging task. This decision can be enhanced by AI-powered systems that analyse large amounts of data, identify patterns and report all observed discrepancies. This paper presents a statistical analysis on the temporal durations of four types of naval statuses: sailing, docked in port, waiting at anchor and not transmitting AIS data. These durations were extracted from the historical activity of different classes of vessels that passed the Black Sea region (Romanian Exclusive Economic Zone) in 2022.

This paper proposes a data-driven approach to anomaly detection, highlighting challenges specific to the maritime domain. This work builds on unsupervised learning techniques which provide models for normal traffic behaviour. A methodology to associate tracks to the derived traffic model is then presented. This is done by the pre-extraction of contextual information as the baseline patterns of life (i.e., routes) in the area under investigation. In addition to a brief description of the approach to derive the routes, their characterization and representation is presented in support of exploitable knowledge to classify anomalies. A hierarchical reasoning is proposed where new tracks are first associated to existing routes based on their positional information only and â€œoff-routeâ€ vesselsâ€ are detected. Then, for on-route vessels further anomalies are detected such as â€œspeed anomalyâ€ or â€œheading anomalyâ€.

"anomaly detection in maritime data based on geometrical analysis of trajectories","2015","Anomaly detection is an important use of the Automatic Identification Systems (AIS), because it offers support to users to evaluate if a vessel is in trouble or causing trouble. For instance, it can be used to detect if a ship is doing something that may cause an accident or if it has changed its route to avoid bad weather condition. In this work, a new method for finding anomalies in the ships' movements is proposed. The method analyzes the trajectory of ships from a geometrical perspective. The trajectory of the ship is compared with a near-optimal path that is generated by a graph search algorithm. The proposed method extracts some scale-invariant features from the real trajectory and also from the optimal movement pattern, and it compares the two sets of features to generate an abnormality score. The method is unsupervised and it does not require training. Instead of labeling the trajectories as normal/abnormal it calculates a score value that denotes the extent of abnormality. The scoring scheme provides a ranking system in which the user can sort the trajectories based on their abnormality score. This is useful when dealing with large number of trajectories and the user wants to picks the most abnormal cases. For the evaluation, the method was run on three months data of North Pacific Ocean and score values were generated. Among the entire dataset, 100 randomly chosen trajectories were labeled by an expert. After applying a threshold on the score value, the proposed method had 94% accuracy.","maritime data,Clustering algorithms,randomly chosen trajectories,optimal movement pattern,anomaly detection,North Pacific Ocean,Marine vehicles,abnormality score,Mathematical model,Feature extraction,geometrical trajectories analysis,scale-invariant features,ships,marine engineering,bad weather condition,AIS,Oceans,near-optimal path,ship trajectory,ship movements,graph theory,graph search algorithm,Joining processes,score values,search problems,Trajectory,automatic identification systems,"
"image-consistent detection of road anomalies as unpredictable patches","2023","We propose a novel method for anomaly detection primarily aiming at autonomous driving. The design of the method, called DaCUP (Detection of anomalies as Consistent Unpredictable Patches), is based on two general properties of anomalous objects: an anomaly is (i) not from a class that could be modelled and (ii) it is not similar (in appearance) to non-anomalous objects in the image. To this end, we propose a novel embedding bottleneck in an auto-encoder like architecture that enables modelling of a diverse, multi-modal known class appearance (e.g. road). Secondly, we introduce novel image-conditioned distance features that allow known class identification in a nearest-neighbour manner on-the-fly, greatly increasing its ability to distinguish true and false positives. Lastly, an inpainting module is utilized to model the uniqueness of detected anomalies and significantly reduce false positives by filtering regions that are similar, thus reconstructable from their neighbourhood. We demonstrate that filtering of regions based on their similarity to neighbour regions, using e.g. an inpainting module, is general and can be used with other methods for reduction of false positives. The proposed method is evaluated on several publicly available datasets for road anomaly detection and on a maritime benchmark for obstacle avoidance. The method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both tasks with the same hyper-parameters with no domain specific design.","Benchmark testing,anomalous objects,road anomaly detection,Feature extraction,detection of anomalies as consistent unpredictable patches,Design methodology,Filtering,nearest-neighbour manner,nonanomalous objects,object detection,feature extraction,multimodal known class appearance,inpainting module,autonomous driving,domain specific design,nearest neighbour methods,Roads,image-consistent detection,mobile robots,image restoration,DaCUP,Task analysis,auto-encoder,Algorithms: Image recognition and understanding (object detection,obstacle avoidance,Computer vision,road vehicles,categorization,image-conditioned distance features,class identification,segmentation),"

"fault detection with lstm-based variational autoencoder for maritime components","2021","Maintenance routines on ships today follow either a reactive maintenance (RM) or preventive maintenance (PvM) approach. RM can be regarded as post-failure repair, which might create large costs. PvM uses predetermined maintenance intervals, which often involves unnecessary maintenance. Recently, prognostics and health management (PHM) has emerged as a potential way to develop an ideal maintenance policy. PHM aims to provide optimal maintenance schedule through the use of sensor measurement for fault detection and fault prognostics, among which fault detection is the first and fundamental action. In this paper, a long-short term memory based variational autoencoder (LSTM-VAE) is proposed for fault detection of maritime components onboard. It is a semi-supervised approach that requires only fault-free data for training. Therefore, it is widely applicable in the maritime industry since operational data in normal conditions already exists. Real-world operation data collected from a diesel engine on the research vessel (RV) Gunnerus is used to validate the method.

This work presents a data-driven non-parametric Bayesian model, based on Gaussian Processes, to model normal shipping behaviour. This model is learned from Automatic Identification System (AIS) data and uses an Active Learning paradigm to select an informative subsample of the data to reduce the computational complexity of training. The resultant model allows a measure of normality to be calculated for each newly-observed transmission according to its velocity given its current latitude and longitude. Using this measure of normality, ships can be identified as potentially anomalous and prioritised for further investigation.

"neural network-based automatic reconstruction of missing vessel trajectory data","2019","Automatic identification system (AIS) is an independent tracking system which has been widely utilized on ships to frequently broadcast the time-stamped vessel position reports. The generated massive AIS data can contribute to protecting maritime security and enhancing maritime transportation efficiency, such as maritime surveillance, anomaly detection and traffic route extraction, etc. However, the received AIS-based vessel trajectories commonly suffer from missing data due to network overload and bad weathers. To improve the quality of vessel trajectories for further researches, a two-step calculation method for vessel trajectory reconstruction is proposed in this work. In particular, the Random Forest method is introduced in the first step to automatically identify the missing position records within vessel trajectories. The missing data points could be accurately estimated from both theoretical and practical perspectives. The second step proposes a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based supervised learning method to reconstruct the vessel trajectories with missing AIS data.

"belief modeling for maritime surveillance","2009","In maritime surveillance, the volume of information to be processed is very large and there is a great deal of uncertainty about the data. There are many vessels at sea at every point in time, and the vast majority of them pose no threat to security. Sifting through all of the benign activity to find unusual activities is a difficult problem. The problem is made even more difficult by the fact that the available data about vessel activities is both incomplete and inconsistent. In order to manage this uncertainty, automated anomaly detection software can be very useful in the early detection of threats to security. This paper introduces a high-level architecture for an anomaly detection system based on a formal model of beliefs with respect to each entity in some domain of interest. In this framework, the system has beliefs about the intentions of each vessel in the maritime domain. If the vessel behaves in an unexpected manner, these intentions are revised and a human operations centre worker is notified. This approach is flexible, scalable, and easily manages inconsistent information. Moreover, the approach has the pragmatic advantage that it uses expert information to inform decision making, but the required information is easily obtained through simple ranking exercises.","surveillance,Anomaly detection,automated anomaly detection software,Marine vehicles,Monitoring,security of data,Decision making,Information security,data uncertainty,belief modeling,Application software,marine engineering,maritime surveillance,Humans,Radar tracking,decision making,high-level architecture,belief revision,Uncertainty,Surveillance,Data security,"

"anomaly detection with unknown anomalies: application to maritime machinery","2021","We present a framework for deriving anomaly detection algorithms on timeseries data when the time and expression of anomalous behaviour is unknown. The framework is suited for problems in which individual machine learning paradigms cannot be directly implemented: supervised learning is not applicable due to the lack of labelled data, unsupervised learning is not effective since the normal operations are insufficiently defined and take complex and diverse forms, and deep learning risks confusing problematic behaviours for expected ones due to the possible repetitiveness of similar anomalies. The proposed approach is comprised of two phases: unsupervised discovery of anomalies, and semi-supervised construction and tuning of the anomaly detection algorithm. By leveraging data exploration methods and expert knowledge, the resulting algorithms are interpretable and detect a wide range of anomalous behaviours. The approach is applied to the early detection of wear and tear of maritime propulsion and manoeuvring machinery.

"grid size optimization for potential field based maritime anomaly detection","2014","This study focuses on improving the potential field based maritime data modeling method, developed to extract traffic patterns and detect anomalies, in a clear, understandable and informative way. The method's novelty lies in employing the concept of a potential field for AIS vessel tracking data abstraction and maritime traffic representation. Unlike the traditional maritime surveillance equipment, such as radar or GPS, the AIS system comprehensively represents the identity and properties of a vessel, as well as its behavior, thus preserving the effects of navigational decisions, based on the skills of experienced seamen. In the developed data modeling process, every vessel generates potential charges, which value represent the vessel's behavior, and drops the charges at locations it passes. Each AIS report is used to assign a potential charge at the reported vessel positions. The method derives three construction elements, which define, firstly, how charges are accumulated, secondly, how a charge decays over time, and thirdly, in what way the potential is distributed around the source charge. The collection of potential fields represents a model of normal behavior, and vessels not conforming to it are marked as anomalous. In the anomaly detection prototype system STRAND, the sensitivity of anomaly detection can be modified by setting a geographical coordinate grid precision to more dense or coarse. The objective of this study is to identify the optimal grid size for two different conditions – an open sea and a port area case. A noticeable shift can be observed between the results for the open sea and the port area. The plotted detection rates converge towards an optimal ratio for smaller grid sizes in the port area (60-200 meters), than in the open sea case (300-1000 meters). The effective outcome of the potential filed based anomaly detection is filtering out all vessels behaving normally and presenting a set of anomalies, for a subsequent incident analysis using STRAND as an information visualization tool.","maritime traffic,potential field,anomaly detection,AIS,"

"from unsupervised to semi-supervised anomaly detection methods for hrrp targets","2020","Responding to the challenge of detecting unusual radar targets in a well identified environment, innovative anomaly and novelty detection methods keep emerging in the literature. This work aims at presenting a benchmark gathering common and recently introduced unsupervised anomaly detection (AD) methods, the results being generated using high-resolution range profiles. A semi-supervised AD (SAD) is considered to demonstrate the added value of having a few labeled anomalies to improve performances. Experiments were conducted with and without pollution of the training set with anomalous samples in order to be as close as possible to real operational contexts. The common AD methods composing our baseline will be One-Class Support Vector Machines (OC-SVM), Isolation Forest (IF), Local Outlier Factor (LOF) and a Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE). The more innovative AD methods put forward by this work are Deep Support Vector Data Description (Deep SVDD) and Random Projection Depth (RPD), belonging respectively to deep and shallow AD. The semi-supervised adaptation of Deep SVDD constitutes our SAD method. HRRP data was generated by a coastal surveillance radar, our results thus suggest that AD can contribute to enhance maritime and coastal situation awareness.","semisupervised anomaly detection methods,Pollution,unusual radar targets,benchmark gathering,Support vector machines,Anomaly detection,radar detection,HRRP targets,anomaly detection,unsupervised learning,high-resolution range profiles,Neural networks,semisupervised adaptation,novelty detection methods,radar target detection,radar computing,innovative anomaly,support vector machines,SAD method,machine learning,object detection,radar target recognition,innovative AD methods,search radar,identified environment,Deep SVDD,high-resolution range profile,Radar,common AD methods,convolutional neural nets,labeled anomalies,Training,One-Class Support Vector Machines,neural network,semisupervised AD,Radar detection,"
"ai-empowered maritime internet of things: a parallel-network-driven approach","2020","As one of the key technologies for realizing a fully digitalized world, the Internet of Things (IoT) requires ubiquitous connections across both land and sea. However, due to lack of infrastructure such as optical fibers and base stations, maritime communications inevitably face a highly complex and heterogeneous environment, which greatly challenges the connection reliability and traffic steering efficiency for future service-oriented maritime IoT. With the recent burgeoning application of artificial intelligence (AI) in many fields, an AI-empowered autonomous network for maritime IoT is envisioned as a promising solution. However, AI typically involves training/learning processes, which require realistic data/environment in order to obtain valuable outcomes. To this end, this article proposes the parallel network, which can be regarded as the 'digital twin' of the real network and is responsible for realizing four key functionalities: self-learning and optimizing, state inference and network cognition, event prediction and anomaly detection, and knowledge database and snapshots. We then explain how various AI methods can facilitate the operation of the parallel- network-driven maritime network. A case study is provided to demonstrate the idea. Research directions are also outlined for further studies.","maritime network,Internet of Things,anomaly detection,Marine vehicles,traffic steering efficiency,network cognition,heterogeneous environment,Reinforcement learning,base stations,AI-empowered autonomous network,state inference,event prediction,ubiquitous computing,AI-empowered maritime Internet of Things,highly complex environment,service-oriented maritime IoT,Databases,computer network reliability,connection reliability,optical fibers,training-learning processes,knowledge database,parallel network,Complexity theory,marine communication,artificial intelligence,learning (artificial intelligence),ubiquitous connections,maritime communications,"
"multi-label classification for ais data anomaly detection using wavelet transform","2022","Thanks to the Automatic Identification System (AIS), ships and other maritime equipment are able to communicate with each other, for example, by sending information about their position. This solution allows for early collision detection when two or more ships are on a collision course. In the newer version of AIS, a satellite infrastructure is used to extend the communication range. Unfortunately, satellite AIS deals with so-called packet collision effect: since there is a problem with synchronizing AIS data coming from multiple terrestrial areas, a single satellite may receive several AIS messages at the same time and be unable to correctly process them, causing the data to get lost or garbled. In this article, a machine learning based framework for detecting the incorrect AIS data is presented. In this approach, after the first stage (clustering), a dedicated anomaly detection algorithm searches for damaged AIS messages and conducts multi-label classification (with Random Forest and wavelet transform) to decide which fields of such message requires further correction. The results of measuring the effectiveness of the proposed approach using real AIS data are presented.","telecommunication security,Clustering algorithms,incorrect AIS data,single satellite,Anomaly detection,Wavelet transforms,anomaly detection,random forests,collision course,Marine vehicles,Machine learning,damaged AIS messages,Data analysis,dedicated anomaly detection algorithm searches,satellite communication,ships,wavelet transform,pattern classification,random forest,Classification algorithms,multiple terrestrial areas,pattern clustering,machine learning based framework,Artificial intelligence,multi-label classification,multilabel classification,wavelet transforms,satellite infrastructure,AIS data anomaly detection,maritime equipment,communication range,Trajectory,marine communication,Labeling,early collision detection,AIS data analysis,packet collision effect,satellite AIS deals,"
"manifold learning techniques for unsupervised anomaly detection","2018","Appropriately identifying outlier data is a critical requirement in the decision-making process of many expert and intelligent systems deployed in a variety of fields including finance, medicine, and defense. Classical outlier detection schemes typically rely on the assumption that normal/background data of interest are distributed according to an assumed statistical model and search for data that deviate from that assumption. However, it is frequently the case that performance is reduced because the underlying distribution does not follow the assumed model. Manifold learning techniques offer improved performance by learning better models of the background but can be too computationally expensive due to the need to calculate a distance measure between all data points. Here, we study a general framework that allows manifold learning techniques to be used for unsupervised anomaly detection by reducing computational expense via a uniform random sampling of a small fraction of the data. A background manifold is learned from the sample and then an out-of-sample extension is used to project unsampled data into the learned manifold space and construct an anomaly detection statistic based on the prediction error of the learned manifold. The method works well for unsupervised anomaly detection because, by definition, the ratio of anomalous to non-anomalous data points is small and the sampling will be dominated by background points. However, a variety of parameters that affect detection performance are introduced so we use here a low-dimensional toy problem to investigate their effect on the performance of four learning algorithms (kernel PCA, two versions of diffusion map, and the Parzen density estimator). We then apply the methods to the detection of watercraft in an ensemble of 22 infrared maritime scenes where we find kernel PCA to be superior and show that it outperforms a commonly employed baseline algorithm. The framework is not limited to the tested image processing example and can be used for any unsupervised anomaly detection task.","Manifolds,Anomaly detection,Image processing,Manifold learning,Target detection,"
"technologies to aid decision making for maritime security","2012","The paper presents 3 key technologies used in an integrated maritime reasoning and monitoring system [1]. These technologies fuse maritime data for decision support in the martime security domain. They support monitoring of scenarios of interest such as terrorist attacks or piracy incidents, and alert operators when such scenarios are assessed likely to happen. These 3 technologies are: a. Dynamic Bayesian Reasoning & Advanced Intelligent Networks (D'Brain), a reasoning system based on Bayesian networks. Causal and probabilistic information about scenarios of interest are structured as Bayesian networks, in which variables are set according to the interpretation of incoming situation information. The system thus provides a systematic approach to modelling and monitoring for scenarios of interest in the maritime situation. b. Graylist Ranking, a ranking technique to order entities based on their structural relationship with black-listed entities. The ranked list of entities could then be used to prioritize further investigation efforts into higher ranking entities which are considered more suspicious. c. Trajectory Analysis using a nonparametric Bayesian model, Dual Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes (Dual-HDP) [2]. It models the activity patterns (norm) of entities in motion. With the norm established, anomaly detection could be performed by evaluating how much each track deviates from the norm.","systematic approach,Dynamic Reasoning,trajectory analysis,sensor fusion,operator alerts,entity list ranking,causal information,situation information,black-listed entity ordering,anomaly detection,Anomaly Detection,Monitoring,maritime data fusion,belief networks,Knowledge engineering,computerised monitoring,Noise measurement,Scenario Modeling,entity activity pattern norm,martime security domain,Bayesian methods,structural relationship,marine safety,Cognitive science,marine engineering,D'Brain,nonparametric statistics,nonparametric Bayesian model,probabilistic information,Relationship Analysis,integrated maritime monitoring system,decision making,Trending,Graylist ranking technique,inference mechanisms,intelligent networks,probability,dual-HDP,dynamic Bayesian reasoning-and-advanced intelligent networks,Cognition,Computational modeling,terrorist attacks,dual-hierarchical Dirichlet processes,scenario-of-interest,decision support,integrated maritime reasoning system,piracy incidents,"
