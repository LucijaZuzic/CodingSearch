"an investigation on the non-stationarity of flood frequency across the uk","2021","Water infrastructure design and flood mitigation projects are currently based on a so-called stationary assumption. However, this assumption has been challenged in recent years due to increased extreme weather, potentially leading to the underestimation of flood quantiles and an increased risk of structural failures. In the present study, peak flow series from 158 gauging stations in the UK are analysed using both stationary and non-stationary models based on the generalised additive models for location, scale and shape (GAMLSS) framework. Nine candidate covariates are used for non-stationary models to obtain information on the significant drivers of non-stationarity in each flood series. Very few stations are thus found to show temporal trends, which suggests that time-varying non-stationary flood models may not always be suitable, and the use of physically-based covariates can provide better-fitting models. In particular, the non-stationary models using rainfall-related covariates display the best performance for the vast majority of stations, thus suggesting that the variability of the rainfall regime remains the dominant driver for changes in flooding. Moreover, two atmospheric circulation patterns, namely the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the East Atlantic Pattern, were found to be closely related to the non-stationarity of flooding at a number of stations. Unlike rainfall, however, the influence of these climate indices is not particularly dominant; hence, they are more suitably employed as components of a multiple-covariate non-stationary model. Besides, a direct linkage between the variability of flooding and climate changes has not been identified either regionally or globally. For the majority of stations (70%), the use of multiple covariates can provide a better non-stationary model than the use of a single covariate.","Flood frequency analysis,Covariate,Non-stationarity,GAMLSS,UK,"

"online learning of temporal logic formulae for signal classification","2018","This paper introduces a method for online inference of temporal logic properties from data. Specifically, we tackle the online supervised learning problem. In this setting, the data is in form of a set of pairs of signals and labels and it becomes available over time. We propose an approach for efficiently processing the data incrementally. In particular, when a new instance is presented, the proposed method updates a binary tree that is linked with the inferred Signal Temporal Logic (STL) formula. This approach presents several benefits. Primarily, it allows the refinement of the current formula when more data is acquired. Moreover, the incremental construction offers insights on the trade-off between formula complexity and classification accuracy. We present two case studies to emphasize the characteristics of the proposed algorithm: 1) a fault classification problem in an automotive system and 2) an anomaly detection problem in the maritime environment.","anomaly detection problem,Prediction algorithms,Machine learning,temporal logic formulae,temporal logic,signal classification,signal temporal logic formula,automotive system,Decision trees,formula complexity,trees (mathematics),Impurities,STL,temporal logic properties,Binary trees,Complexity theory,online supervised learning problem,inference mechanisms,maritime environment,incremental construction,Task analysis,binary tree,online inference,learning (artificial intelligence),fault classification problem,"

"a comparative investigation of data-driven approaches based on one-class classifiers for condition monitoring of marine machinery system","2020","The safety and reliability of ship navigation depend heavily on the performance of the marine machinery system, which can be maintained at a high level by condition based maintenance. Intelligent condition monitoring is the key to achieve condition based maintenance. However, it is not easy to realize intelligent condition monitoring in a real ship, because there are not enough labeled fault samples to train an accurate detection model. In fact, the potential value of a large number of normal samples collected by the shipboard monitoring system has not been mined out. Since one-class classifiers only need one-class samples to train the detection models, they are very suitable for such occasions. In this paper, we investigate the performance of several representative one-class classifiers, such as OCSVM (One class support vector machine), SVDD (Support vector data description), GKNN (Global k-nearest neighbors), LOF (Local outlier factor), IForest (Isolation forest) and ABOD (Angle-based outlier detection), in condition monitoring of the marine machinery system. The dataset of a marine gas turbine propulsion system is used for a case study, which is a simulation dataset verified by the real ship data. Compared with previous literatures, our new work is to investigate the performance of a variety of key one-class classifiers, not only considering the common evaluation indexes for machine learning, but also considering the sample combinations of the training dataset, distribution of misclassified samples, and the tolerance to contaminated data. The experimental results show that these algorithms have good performance in the dataset in some common evaluation indexes. However, they show some obvious performance differences in some novel evaluation indexes we proposed. This can provide decision support for the application of one-class classifiers in the condition monitoring of many other marine machinery systems.","One-class classifier,Marine machinery,Condition based maintenance,Condition monitoring,"
"generating bunkering statistics from ais data: a machine learning approach","2021","In shipping, the optimization of the bunkering location is dependent on price, deviation from the planned route and the cost of delays incurred by the bunkering operation itself. Despite their potential importance, detailed statistics for bunkering operations at the individual port call level (e.g. waiting times, barge capacity, location - anchorage or terminal) are not available. I develop a new method, based on the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm, that can a) identify tanker vessels used as bunkering tankers, b) detect stationary ocean-going vessels at anchorage or alongside terminals and c) automatically recognize bunkering operations as a rendezvous between an ocean-going vessel and a bunkering barge. I find that the high time complexity of the DBSCAN algorithm in this setting can be compensated by adjusting the algorithm to distributed computer settings. In the empirical study, I use the output to describe the relative importance of Mediterranean ports for bunkering and provide statistics on waiting and servicing times. The empirical findings are important for the optimization of the bunkering location decision in shipping and studies on regional port competitiveness.","Bunkering operations,Bunkering statistics,DBSCAN,Machine learning,Spatial recognition,"
"comparison of ship detection algorithms using alos-palsar, ground-based maritime radar, and ais","2011","MLCC (Multi-Look Cross-Correlation) is a useful technique to extract the images of ships embedded in sea clutter from SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) data. However, the previous MLCC has a difficulty of detecting small ships since SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio) is not high enough. Therefore, we developed a new Improved MLCC (IMLCC) to increase SNR to extract small boats. Although the IMLCC method increased SNR, there still remained some highly correlated noises in the coherence images caused by strong radar backscatter from sea surface. In order to improve the IMLCC algorithm further, we propose a new method of applying Lognormal-CFAR (Constant False Alarm Rate) to IMLCC coherence images.

"reliability analysis with corrosion defects in submarine pipeline case study: oil pipeline in ab-khark island","2022","The offshore industry widely uses offshore pipelines to transport petroleum products due to their high capacity and reasonable installation costs. Corrosion is the leading failure cause of offshore pipelines, and their reliability analysis is necessary for reducing maintenance costs. This study presents a corrosion analysis in the bursting mode of the pipeline using a codified method based on probabilistic space theory, considering the monitored data of the oil pipeline and the pigging data of the AB-KHARK pipeline. The relationship between pigging data, parameters affecting corrosion, and the reduction of pipe wall thickness are determined based on the indicators of Regression and Neural Network machine learning methods. A new method is presented for modeling the failure modes of offshore pipelines based on their historical data and statistical computation results. Finally, the system is investigated by the first-order reliability method considering the limit state function provided by evaluating the offshore pipeline reliability.

"learning ship activity patterns in maritime data streams: enhancing cep rule learning by temporal and spatial relations and domain-specific functions","2023","Maritime surveillance systems are of particular importance for the smooth and safe operation of maritime traffic. Such systems must efficiently analyze the continuous stream of incoming ship movement data to provide an up-to-date picture of the situation at sea. Complex Event Processing (CEP) is a software technology dedicated to the analysis of data streams in real time and seems to be promising for maritime surveillance as well. CEP is based on rules that usually have to be formulated manually by domain experts. Recently, several approaches of learning CEP rules have been proposed. However, all these approaches are limited to standard CEP rule languages which are not well suited for describing maritime situations. In this paper, we extend Bat4CEP, an innovative bat-inspired approach to automatic CEP rule learning, to meet the specific needs of the maritime domain. In particular, we extend the rule language of Bat4CEP to include temporal-spatial operators and domain-specific functions. This extended rule language makes it possible to express complex maritime facts in a simple and understandable form. Furthermore, it is shown how the proposed rule language extensions can be integrated into the Bat4CEP learning approach. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated through extensive experiments with real maritime data streams.","Seaports,metaheuristics,Metaheuristics,Standards,Artificial intelligence,Maritime transportation,Surveillance,interpretable AI,Real-time systems,complex event processing,Marine vehicles,maritime data analytics,machine learning,"

"induction motor short circuit diagnosis and interpretation under voltage unbalance and load variation conditions","2023","Predictions from machine learning algorithms have often supported decision-making in industrial processes. Despite this, complex models can be challenging to interpret, sometimes shrouding the entire prediction process in an undesirable mystery. Understanding how the classifiers’ recommendations are made helps human experts understand the phenomenon and develop better data-driven solutions. Therefore, this study takes advantage of Shapley additive explanations to explain the predictions obtained by the classifier and select the most appropriate features for the approaches. The experiments use extreme gradient boosting to evaluate temporal, spectral, and wavelet features of three-phase induction motor current signals. The proposed approach effectively reduces the number of attributes without losing performance, provides an understanding of how each feature affects the model over a wide range of voltage unbalances and torque values, and detects early inter-turn short circuits with severity of 1%. The results show that combining the intelligent model with Shapley explanations improves stator winding fault diagnosis in these highly problematic situations.","Inter-turn short circuit,Explainable artificial intelligence,Shapley additive explanations,Fault diagnosis,Induction machines,Machine learning,"
"imitating radar operator decisions for maritime surveillance missions using bayesian networks","2019","This paper presents the use of Bayesian networks for learning decisions made by a human radar operator carrying out a maritime surveillance mission. By imitating the operator's decisions, a significant increase in the autonomy of a radar surveillance system can be achieved as well as potentially streamlining the qualification process. For maritime scenarios, current literature has only focused on using a Bayesian network (BN) for identification and assessment, and often assumes inputs from a generic surveillance sensor. Furthermore, in both the maritime surveillance and radar operations domain, there has been no investigation into using the operator's data in order to learn the decisions made throughout the mission. This paper uses a realtime radar simulation in order to obtain the scenario and radar information that would be observed by a human operator. In conjunction with a user interface, the simulation is further used to obtain operator decisions for a given mission with the maximum likelihood approach used to obtain the BN probabilities. The BN is then used in place of the operator for interfacing with the simulation in order to test the suitability of this method. Several typical scenarios are used to demonstrate the BN's operational ability relative to that of the operator. Additionally, the required data size for sufficient performance is investigated.","radar surveillance system,surveillance,Bayes methods,radar operations domain,belief networks,Bayesian networks,human radar operator,realtime radar simulation,maritime scenarios,radar operator decisions,target tracking,learning decisions,radar computing,machine learning,radar information,Graphical user interfaces,generic surveillance sensor,Radar tracking,Artificial intelligence,maritime surveillance mission,radar tracking,Airborne radar,probability,Bayesian network,Surveillance,Task analysis,imitation learning,learning (artificial intelligence),"

"advances in integrated system health management for mission-essential and safety-critical aerospace applications","2022","Integrated System Health Management (ISHM) is a promising technology that fuses sensor data and historical state-of-health information of components and subsystems to provide actionable information and enable intelligent decision-making regarding the operation and maintenance of aerospace systems. ISHM fundamentally relies on assessments and predictions of system health, including the early detection of failures and estimation of Remaining Useful Life (RUL). Model-based, data-driven or hybrid reasoning techniques can be utilized to maximise the timeliness and reliability of diagnosis and prognosis information. The benefits of ISHM include enhancing the maintainability, reliability, safety and performance of systems. The next evolution of the ISHM concept, Intelligent Health and Mission Management (IHMM), delves deeper into the utilization of on-line system health predictions to modify mission profiles to ensure safety and reliability, as well as efficiency through predictive integrity. This concept is particularly important for Trusted Autonomous System (TAS) applications, where an accurate assessment of the current and future system state-of-health to make operational decisions (with or without human intervention) is integral to both flight safety and mission success. IHMM systems introduce the capability of predicting degradation in the functional performance of subsystems, with sufficient time to dynamically identify which appropriate restorative or reconfiguration actions to take in order to ensure that the system can perform at an acceptable level of operational capability before the onset of a failure event. This paper reviews some of the key advancements and contributions to knowledge in the field of ISHM for the aerospace industry, with a particular focus on various architectures and reasoning strategies involving the use of artificial intelligence. The paper also discusses the key challenges faced in the development and deployment of ISHM systems in the aerospace industry and highlights the safety-critical role that IHMM will play in future cyber-physical and autonomous system applications (both vehicle and ground support systems), such as Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Traffic Management (UTM), Urban Air Mobility (UAM) and Distributed Satellite Systems (DSS).","UAS,UTM,Unmanned aircraft system,Avionics,Artificial intelligence,Health and usage monitoring systems,Distributed satellite systems,Intelligent health and mission management,Diagnostics,Satellite systems,Prognostics,Integrated system health management,Machine learning,UAS Traffic management,"

"an enhanced intelligent model: to protect marine iot sensor environment using ensemble machine learning approach","2021","The research in marine sensors and the Internet of Things (IoT) has grown exponentially with the ample warehouse of natural materials in the sea. The growing activities in the marine sensor environment increased the threat of anomalies and cyber-attacks. Many Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and classical machine learning-based models have been proposed to secure the sensor-based IoT infrastructure. Still, these mechanisms have failed to achieve significant results for securing the marine sensor environment due to the discriminant requirements of the IoT appliances in deep oceans, such as distribution, information complexity, scalability, higher network bandwidth requirements, and low computational capacity. Hence, we propose a lightweight and robust ensemble model to secure the marine IoT environment from cyber-attacks and malicious activities. This paper established an optimized Light Gradient Boosting Machine (Light-GBM) algorithm for ocean IoT attack detection. The experiments were conducted on Distributed Smart Space Orchestration System (DS2OS) dataset. The proposed methodology includes a label encoding technique for best feature selection, hyper-parameter tuning, ensemble function, and a novel algorithm to develop an ocean IoT attack detection model. As an extension of traditional methods, the optimized Light-GBM model can handle the distributed IoT attacks in the deeper marine environments with low computational cost and with 98.52% detection accuracy. The comparative analysis confirms the effectiveness of the proposed model for marine sensor safety. Conclusively, the proposed model mitigates the threat of cyber-attacks in the marine sensor environment and presenting a promising future in real-time ocean-based IoT applications.","Marine data safety,Sensor-based infrastructure,Light-GBM,Internet of things (IoT),Machine learning,Ensemble-learning,"
"towards a convolutional neural network model for classifying regional ship collision risk levels for waterway risk analysis","2020","Estimating the navigational risk of vessels operating in sea and waterway areas is important for waterway risk management and pollution preparedness and response planning. Existing methods relying on a model-informed expert judgment of ship-ship collision risk are of limited practical use because periodic risk monitoring is feasible only when this can be done without extensive use of organizational resources. To alleviate such limitations, this article presents a new approach based Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and image recognition to interpret and classify ship-ship collision risks in encounter scenarios. The specific aim of the article is to investigate whether a CNN-based model can quickly and accurately interpret images constructed based on data from the Automatic Identification System (AIS) in terms of collision risk. To test this, estimates derived from training data are compared to validation data. It is also investigated whether adding additional navigational information based on AIS data improves the model's predictive accuracy. A case study with data from the Baltic Sea area is implemented, where various model design alternatives are tested as a proof-of-concept. The main finding of this work is that a CNN-based approach can indeed meet the specified design requirements, suggesting that this is a fruitful direction for future work. Several issues requiring further research and developed are discussed, with the validity of the risk ratings underlying the image classification seen as the most significant conceptual challenge before a CNN-model can be put to practical use.","Image recognition,Maritime Safety,Convolutional Neural Network,Ship-ship collision,AIS data,Machine learning,"
"new frontiers in the risk assessment of ship collision","2023","Navigation is becoming more and more complex over the years. The increase in maritime traffic and vessel size is inducing a global escalation of ship collision accidents, with consequent losses of human lives and economic assets worth billions.

In this respect, the demand for advanced methods to assess and mitigate ship collision risk has never been higher. The interdependency between physical failures, weather conditions, logistics, governance and human factors requires sophisticated frameworks to effectively assist maritime authorities and navigators in decision-making. The present work reviews the most recent advancements in the risk assessment of ship collision. The article focuses on new, rising technologies, identifying the current main trends and discussing future perspectives and challenges. The review revealed a wide and diversified range of methods, including machine learning, clustering techniques, swarm intelligence algorithms and others. To frame the methods in the current literature and compare them with previous efforts, they are categorized according to literature classifications. Advancements of well-established approaches and new promising tools are discussed, considering methods that allow the inclusion of quantitative and qualitative variables in the assessment.

"machine learning and data-driven fault detection for ship systems operations","2020","Well maintained vessels exhibit high reliability, safety and energy efficiency. Even though machinery failures are inevitable, their occurrence can be foreseen when predictive maintenance schemes are implemented. Predictive maintenance may be optimally applied through condition, performance, and process monitoring. Most importantly, it can include the detection of developing faults, which affect the performance of ship systems and hinder energy-efficient operations of ships. Under this viewpoint, this paper proposes a new data-driven fault detection methodology in a novel application for shipboard systems, by exploring the “learning potential” of recorded voyage data. The proposed methodology, combines the benefits of Expected Behaviour (EB) models, by selecting the optimal regression model, with the Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) for fault detection, in novel ship applications. It is seen that a multiple polynomial ridge regression model, with testing R2score of nearly 0.96 and can accurately detect certain developing faults manifesting in both the Main Engine (ME) cylinder Exhaust Gas (EG) temperature and the ME scavenging air pressure. The early detection of developing faults can be used to supplement the daily monitoring of ship operations and enable the planning of pre-emptive rectifying actions by reducing sub-optimal machinery conditions.","Pre-processing,Fault detection,Ship machinery systems,Expected behaviour,Machine learning,Ship operations,"

The multi-class anomaly framework captures AIS message dropouts due to various reasons, e.g., channel effects or intentional one for carrying illegal activities. We extract position, speed, course and timing information from real world AIS data, and use them to train a 2-class (normal and anomaly) and a 3-class (normal, power outage and anomaly) anomaly detection models. Our results show that the models achieve around 99.9% overall accuracy, and are able to classify a test sample in the order of microseconds.","security of data,maritime traffic situation awareness,multiclass anomaly framework,pattern classification,multiclass artificial neural network,AIS message dropouts,neural nets,illegal fishing,learning (artificial intelligence),illegal activities,ships,automatic identification system,marine engineering,machine learning-assisted anomaly detection,maritime navigation,AIS transponders,"
"analysis of terrain attributes in different spatial resolutions for digital soil mapping application in southeastern brazil","2020","Terrain attributes are used as auxiliary variables in spatial prediction of soil classes and properties, due to their important role in the pedogenetic process and the increasing availability of digital elevation models (DEMs) in different resolutions. This work analyzed the effect of the different spatial resolutions of the DEMs and attributes derived from terrain and their implications for application in DSM predictive models. We used three spatial resolutions from different DEMs: (1) LIDAR – 2 m; (2) ALOS PALSAR – 12.5 and 30 m; (3) SRTM – 30 m; and (4) ASTER GDEM – 30 m. Multivariate analyses were performed determined by the Pearson linear correlation coefficient (r), the K-means cluster analysis, and the principal component analysis (PCA). The prediction of soil classes was performed using the terrain attributes grouped as to sensitivity to resolution, for different spatial resolutions, applying the machine learning algorithms Random Forest and Support Vector Machine. The cluster analysis indicated that most attributes remained within the same group of resolution sensitivity with changes in the cell size of reference DEM. The attributes of the terrain grouped low sensitive to resolution derived from the SRTM DEM showed better precision and the main advantage was the low cost and facilitating computational processing for application in the DSM.","Machine learning,Multivariate analysis,Digital elevation model,Morphometry,"
"intrusion detection for maritime transportation systems with batch federated aggregation","2023","As a fast-growing and promising technology, Internet of Things (IoT) significantly promotes the informationization and intelligentization of Maritime Transportation System (MTS). The massive data collected during the voyage is usually disposed of with the assistance of cloud or edge computing, which imposes serious cyber security threats. For multifarious cyber-attacks, Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is one of the efficient mechanisms to prevent IoT devices from network intrusion. However, most of the methods based on deep learning train their models in a centralized manner, which needs uploading all data to the central server for training, increasing the risk of privacy disclosure. In this paper, we consider the characteristics of IoT-based MTS and propose a CNN-MLP based model for intrusion detection which is trained through Federated Learning, named FedBatch. Federated Learning keeps the model training local and only updates the global model through the exchange of model parameters, preserving the privacy of local data on vessels. First, the characteristics of the communication between different vessels are discussed to model the federated learning process during the voyage. Then, the lightweight local model constructed by Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Multi-Layer Perception (MLP) is designed to save on computing and storage overhead. Moreover, to mitigate the straggler problem during the federated learning in MTS, we proposed an adaptive aggregation method, named Batch Federated Aggregation, which suppresses the oscillations of model parameters during federated learning. Finally, the simulation results on the NSL-KDD dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of FedBatch.","Maritime Transportation System,CNN-MLP based model,computer network security,federated learning process,IoT,Collaborative work,deep learning (artificial intelligence),serious cyber security threats,maritime transportation systems,Internet of Things,cloud,security of data,multifarious cyber-attacks,privacy preservation,Maritime Transportation systems,deep learning,Servers,lightweight local model,model training local,Data models,massive data,network intrusion,voyage,edge computing,federated learning,IoT-based MTS,adaptive aggregation method,multilayer perceptrons,convolutional neural nets,model parameters,Training,Convolutional neural networks,Intrusion detection,Intrusion Detection System,named Batch Federated Aggregation,IoT devices,learning (artificial intelligence),data privacy,global model,"
"ocean of things : affordable maritime sensors with scalable analysis","2019","DARPA's Ocean of Things (OoT) program enables persistent maritime situational awareness over large ocean areas by deploying thousands of low-cost, intelligent floats that drift as a distributed sensor network. Each float manages a suite of commercially available sensors to collect environmental data such as sea surface temperature, sea state, and location as well as activity data about vessels and marine mammals moving across the ocean. The floats periodically transmit processed data, or immediately report events based on internal prioritization schemes. Messages travel via commercial satellite to a government cloud for storage and real-time analysis. Cloud-based data analytics feature machine learning aimed at discovering emergent features and behaviors from sparse data. The multiple performers manufacturing floats and developing software are being led by a government management team to employ commercial design methodology and agile best practices. At-sea float deployments are planned in two phases over 2019 (1-month) and 2020 (3-month).

"a review of maritime spatio-temporal data analytics","2021","The vessels in maritime regions need to be specifically monitored and assessed since they play an important role in environment, safety, economy and security. One of the technologies that has been developed to monitor vessels that are sailing is Automatic Identification System (AIS). While AISâ€™s initial purpose was to provide automatic reporting between ships, it is now a primary source of worldwide information of maritime vessels. The navigational data that is transmitted by the vessels over AIS falls under the category of spatio-temporal data, which implies that it includes the dimension of space as well as time. This added dimension of time gives considerable insight into the information that can be ascertained from the data, however, at the expense of added complexity in analysis. Two of the major application areas that are being analysed are Maritime Surveillance and Maritime Spatial Planning. Both of these try to gain insights from AIS data to enhance the available information in their context. Analysing this requires various data analytic techniques to be applied to it. This paper examines this field of study, right from the data to information stage.","primary source,surveillance,Safety,sustainable development,automatic reporting,maritime regions,information stage,maritime vessels,Planning,maritime spatio-temporal data analytics,Maritime Spatial Planning,Data Analytics,considerable insight,worldwide information,Data analysis,Reproducibility of results,added complexity,data analysis,economy,ships,monitor vessels,Performance evaluation,marine engineering,data analytic techniques,Automatic Identification System,Maritime Surveillance,AIS,renewable energy sources,Data Mining,navigational data,Machine Learning,Spatio-temporal Data,AIS's initial purpose,Navigation,Surveillance,security,AIS data,Maritime Situational Awareness,aquaculture,"
"learning for prediction of maritime collision avoidance behavior from ais network","2021","With the rapid increase in global maritime shipping, there is a great demand for the technology of maritime traffic monitoring to detect inappropriate encountering interaction between ships and prevent ship collision accidents. The Automatic Identification System (AIS) network makes it possible to collect a large volume of maritime traffic data and investigate the collision avoidance behavior of real-world ships. Most collision avoidance systems are based on expert systems and simulations based on the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGs). Those regulations outline the general principles underlying collision avoidance; however, they do not provide specific guidance and fail to account for the complexity of many real-world situations. Furthermore, guidance systems coordinating the movement of a ship must have the capacity to predict the movement behavior of all ships involved in potential encounter situations, and do so as early as possible for anti-collision reaction. Our objective in this study was to model the collision avoidance behaviors of human operators in order to formulate a set of realistic trajectory predictions for encountering near collision scenarios. By machine learning approach, the proposed framework is able to learn a model of interaction movement behavior from collected AIS historical traffic data involving near collision situations and then generate a set of predicted trajectories while ships encountering. The proposed model eliminates the need for a priori information related to environmental conditions and the rules governing encounter situations. The resulting projections can be used to suggest anti-collision paths for navigators or to guide the selection of collision-free paths for maritime autonomous surface ships.","maritime traffic monitoring,collision-free paths,Regulation,maritime traffic data,Automatic Identification System network,collision avoidance systems,maritime autonomous surface ships,Marine vehicles,Machine learning,control engineering computing,Predictive models,AIS network,ships,marine safety,global maritime shipping,anti-collision paths,International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea,machine learning,Sea surface,expert systems,marine engineering computing,interaction movement behavior,encounter situation,Trajectory,collision avoidance behavior,trajectory prediction,AIS historical traffic data collection,ship collision accidents,Navigation,navigation,COLREG,collision avoidance,marine control,learning (artificial intelligence),maritime collision avoidance behavior prediction,"
"a mec-iiot intelligent threat detector based on machine learning boosted tree algorithms","2023","In recent years, new management methods have appeared that mark the beginning of a new industrial revolution called Industry 4.0 or the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). IIoT brings together new emerging technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Deep Learning (DL) and Machine Learning (ML), that contribute to new applications, industrial processes and efficiency management in factories. This combination of new technologies and contexts is paired with Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) to reduce costs through the virtualisation of networks and services. As these new paradigms increase in growth, so does the number of threats and vulnerabilities, making IIoT a very desirable target for cybercriminals. In addition, IIoT devices have certain intrinsic limitations, especially due to their limited resources, and this makes it impossible, in many cases, to detect attacks by using solutions designed for other paradigms. So it is necessary to design, implement and evaluate new solutions or adapt existing ones. Therefore, this paper proposes an intelligent threat detector based on boosted tree algorithms. Such detectors have been implemented and evaluated in an environment specifically designed to test IIoT deployments. In this way, we can learn how these algorithms, which have been successful in multiple contexts, behave in a paradigm with known constraints. The results obtained in the study show that our intelligent threat detector achieves a mean efficiency of between 95%–99% in the F1 Score metric, indicating that it is a good option for implementation in these scenarios.","Industrial Internet of Things,Multi-access Edge Computing,Machine Learning,Intrusion detection system,Cybersecurity,"

"demurrage pattern analysis using logical analysis of data: a case study of the ulsan port authority","2022","Maritime logistics, which accounts for around 80% of international trade around the world, has been a driving force for economic growth. Increases in maritime traffic, however, lead to increased congestion in berths and terminals. This congestion in turn negatively affects the total ship turnaround time and leads to decreased efficiency in port operations and a higher demurrage rate, which refers to the number of vessels in queue for more than a fixed time period waiting to load/unload out of the total number of vessels entering a port. The demurrage rate directly affects a port’s operating profits; thus, this rate needs to stay as low as possible. In this study, we focus on developing a methodology to address the demurrage rate of a port. To this end, we first collect two sets of vessel data (2016 annual data for training and 2019 annual data for validating) for ships entering and leaving the Port of Ulsan in the Republic of Korea and integrate these datasets with berth data and weather data. We tailor the logical analysis of data (LAD) technique to derive the patterns from the training data that mitigate or aggravate the demurrage rate. We use these patterns to predict the demurrage rate for the validating set of data. The overall binary classification results demonstrate the proposed LAD technique’s competitive performance, compared with other state-of-the-art machine learning methods. We then analyze the patterns to derive policy suggestions that can lower the demurrage rate at the Port of Ulsan. Our computational experiments find that the availability of tugs or pilots and port arrival times mainly affect the demurrage rate at the Port of Ulsan. Finally, our study showcases new possibilities for using patterns of demurrage and non-demurrage vessels obtained by LAD to help policymakers and port operators address the growing demurrage problem.","Maritime logistics,Maritime traffic data,Logical analysis of data,Port congestion,Demurrage rate,"
"high fidelity digital twin-based anomaly detection and localization for smart water grid operation management","2023","Smart Water Grid (SWG) plays a critical role in sustaining cities economic and social development, but challenges remain in fully realizing the benefits of SWG. While Digital twin (DT) has been discussed in some literature for possible SWG applications, there has been limited, or no technical framework developed to facilitate SWG operation and management. In this paper, a generic framework is developed for constructing SWG high fidelity Digital Twin (DT) by integrating digital thread with various digital models for visualization, data-driven analysis, physics-based simulations, and decision-making support. Both the physics-based models and data-driven models are trained/retrained and calibrated/re-calibrated respectively by using the data collected with the sensors installed throughout a SWG. The information derived from the SWG DT can be diagnostic, predictive, and prescriptive to significantly augment users’ intelligence for improving SWG operation and management. One important application of digital twin augmented intelligence is illustrated to timely detect and localize anomaly events, which may include, but not be limited to, pipe bursts and unauthorized water usages. The solution is tested on the selected areas in Singapore to construct the ever-green DT by calibrating and recalibrating the models for near real-time SWG operation management. The case study was conducted for three supply zones with the total pipeline length of more than 1000 km and 40 weeks of monitoring data, collected by 89 pressure monitoring stations and 8 flow meters at inlets and boundary. More than 3300 data-driven models are trained for optimizing the model performance to achieve accuracy of greater than 80% F1 score for detecting anomaly events, which are subsequently localized within 400 m with 2–3 days lead time.","Data analytics,Anomaly localization,Smart water grid,Anomaly detection,Machine learning,Digital twin,"
"el-nahl: exploring labels autoencoding in augmented hidden layers of feedforward neural networks for cybersecurity in smart grids","2022","Reliability and security of power distribution and data traffic in smart grid (SG) are very important for industrial control systems (ICS). Indeed, SG cyber-physical connectivity is subject to several vulnerabilities that can damage or disrupt its process immunity via cyberthreats. Today's ICSs are experiencing highly complex data change and dynamism, increasing the complexity of detecting and mitigating cyberattacks. Subsequently, and since Machine Learning (ML) is widely studied in cybersecurity, the objectives of this paper are twofold. First, for algorithmic simplicity, a small-scale ML algorithm that attempts to reduce computational costs is proposed. The algorithm adopts a neural network with an augmented hidden layer (NAHL) to easily and efficiently accomplish the learning procedures. Second, to solve the data complexity problem regarding rapid change and dynamism, a label autoencoding approach is introduced for Embedding Labels in the NAHL (EL-NAHL) architecture to take advantage of labels propagation when separating data scatters. Furthermore, to provide a more realistic analysis by addressing real-world threat scenarios, a dataset of an electric traction substation used in the high-speed rail industry is adopted in this work. Compared to some existing algorithms and other previous works, the achieved results show that the proposed EL-NAHL architecture is effective even under massive dynamically changed and imbalanced data.","Neural networks,Cybersecurity,Label propagation,Machine learning,Smart grids,"
"enabling maritime risk assessment using natural language processing-based deep learning techniques","2020","Maritime vessels around the world risk encountering dangerous situations during their voyages such as piracy, kidnappings, hijackings, and smugglings. Such dangers may put crews at risk and potentially cause extensive damage to both the vessel and its cargo. Maritime risk assessment is a process of analyzing such factors to positively impact the safety and timeliness of operations. Analyzing the high-risk areas in seas and oceans can help vessels route around areas with previously recorded high levels of dangerous activities. This information is scraped and extracted from various maritime documents, including newspaper articles, social media, incident blogs, and operational reports. After textual data sources are parsed, it is possible to use this extracted information as training datasets into a Machine Learning (ML) model using Natural Language Processing (NLP) Deep Learning (DL) techniques. With these methods, we can perform document classification, risk extraction, text summarization, topic modeling, and information extraction in an automated manner. Methods that are used include the bag-of words (BOW) approach and, in particular, the use of Named Entity Recognition (NER) to identify specific areas around the world that are considered a risk to a particular voyage. Once this information is processed, the model can determine and aggregate specific areas of high-risk activity. We propose a Maritime Event Log (MEL) pipeline using DL methods. This pipeline includes binary document classification (DC) to extract positive instances of incidents, an incident type classification (IC,) and an information extraction module (IE) including date and location and ship type extraction. With such information available, it is possible to avoid dangerous situations, which may have a significant level of impact on the safety and success rate of maritime operations.","Bit error rate,Pipelines,newspaper articles,Text categorization,Hidden Markov models,deep learning (artificial intelligence),Information retrieval,machine learning model,maritime vessels,information retrieval,natural language processing,maritime risk assessment,safety,bag-of words approach,high-risk activity,information extraction module,ships,marine safety,marine engineering,maritime event log pipeline,vessels route,operational reports,ship type extraction,named entity recognition,risk management,pattern classification,incident type classification,Classification algorithms,maritime documents,text summarization,incident blogs,Training,risk extraction,textual data sources,text analysis,deep learning techniques,social media,maritime operations,binary document classification,topic modeling,"
"hybrid approaches for container traffic forecasting in the context of anomalous events: the case of the yangtze river delta region in the covid-19 pandemic","2022","The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on container transportation. Accurate forecasting of container throughput is critical for policymakers and port authorities, especially in the context of the anomalous events of the COVID-19 pandemic. In this paper, we firstly proposed hybrid models for univariate time series forecasting to enhance prediction accuracy while eliminating the nonlinearity and multivariate limitations. Next, we compared the forecasting accuracy of different models with various training dataset extensions and forecasting horizons. Finally, we analysed the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on container throughput forecasting and container transportation. An empirical analysis of container throughputs in the Yangtze River Delta region was performed for illustration and verification purposes. Error metrics analysis suggests that SARIMA-LSTM2 and SARIMA-SVR2 (configuration 2) have the best performance compared to other models and they can better predict the container traffic in the context of anomalous events such as the COVID-19 pandemic. The results also reveal that, with an increase in the training dataset extensions, the accuracy of the models is improved, particularly in comparison with standard statistical models (i.e. SARIMA model). An accurate prediction can help strategic management and policymakers to better respond to the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.","SARIMA model,COVID-19 pandemic,Hybrid model,Machine learning model,Yangtze River Delta multi-port region,"

"keynote: multi-domain situational awareness - from the underwater to the space domain to improve maritime surveillance","2022","Modern surveillance systems require to integrate coherently all available sources of information to compose an operational picture that is as complete as possible. While in the past surveillance had suffered from a lack of data, current technology transformed the problem into one of an overabundance of information, leading to an extreme need for automated analysis. Indeed, current surveillance sensors generate volumes of data that would have been unthinkable only a few years ago. Therefore, all the processing, algorithm calibration, parameter tuning, etc., need to be executed as much automatically as possible. This also requires novel paradigms for algorithmic design. In this respect, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Data Fusion (DF) offer an unprecedented opportunity to strengthen the technological edge; however, the risk is to elevate, at the same time, the speed of the threats we face. Indeed, the surveillance task is complicated by the diversification of threats, whose nature and origin is most often unknown. AI and DF techniques have the potential to identify patterns emerging within these very large datasets, fused from a variety of sources and generated from monitoring wide areas on a day-to-day basis, and use the learned knowledge to anticipate the possible evolution(s) of the operational picture.

"machine learning for shaft power prediction and analysis of fouling related performance deterioration","2021","Improving operational performance and reducing fuel consumption is increasingly important for shipping companies. Ship performance degrades over time due to hull and propeller fouling; therefore assessing when fouling effects are significant enough to warrant cleaning is critical. Advancements in onboard data logging systems, combined with machine learning techniques, unlock the potential to predict fouling effects accurately and determine when to clean. This study evaluates five models for shaft power prediction: Multiple Linear Regression, Decision Tree (AdaBoost), K – Nearest Neighbours, Artificial Neural Network and Random Forest. The importance of pre-processing is highlighted, contributing to the creation of a model with lower errors than previous studies. The significance of environmental parameters was explored, with the novel integration of wave statistics to the operational dataset, and simulated power-speed curves created from predictions to identify performance deterioration due to fouling. The Random Forest model was most effective in predicting shaft power, with an error of 1.17%. The addition of ‘Days Since Clean’ and ‘Significant Wave Height’ increased prediction accuracy by 0.07% and 0.12% respectively.

This study aims to enhance maritime situational awareness through the use of computational intelligence techniques in detecting anomalies.

In the development of GeMASS, a machine learning approach was applied to discover knowledge that is applicable in characterizing maritime security threats. Such knowledge is often implicit in datasets and difficult to discover by human analysts. As the knowledge relevant to maritime security may vary from time to time, GeMASS was specified to learn from streaming data and to generate up-to-date knowledge in a dynamic fashion. Based on the knowledge discovered, the system functions to screen vessels for anomalies in real-time. Traditionally in maritime security studies, datasets that are applied as knowledge sources are related to vessels’ geographical and movement information.

"sarfish: space-based maritime surveillance using complex synthetic aperture radar imagery","2022","Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery is an essential part of maritime surveillance since it can operate in most weather conditions, day and night. Space-borne SAR especially can provide a large surveillance coverage in which both ground-range detected (GRD) imagery at a reduced resolution and single-look complex (SLC) imagery at a finer resolution of the same observation scene are available. Recently, a large, fully labeled, Sentinel-1 GRD based dataset, named xView3-SAR, was released to promote machine learning (ML) research in detection and classification of ships in order to assist with monitoring illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing activities. In this paper, the xView3-SAR's companion SLC dataset, called the SARFish, is introduced. The aim is to promote the use of SLC data for improving IUU fishing ship detection and classification. An ML-based algorithm using the combined GRD-SLC SAR data is presented as a base-line model for demonstration. The algorithm consists of a constant false-alarm rate (CFAR) detector whose false-alarm rate is reduced by a cascade of classifiers trained using the GRD data, followed by a ship classifier trained using the SLC data. Preliminary results suggest that despite not using multi-looks to reduce sea-clutter spikes, the use of SLC images does not degrade ship detection.

Therefore, human awareness training and software technologies are necessary precautions to ensure the reliability of data traffic and power transmission. By exploring the available literature, it is undeniable that Machine Learning (ML) has become the latest in the timeline and one of the leading artificial intelligence technologies capable of detecting, identifying, and responding by mitigating adversary attacks in SGs.

"self healing databases for predictive risk analytics in safety-critical systems","2020","Assuring the quality, consistency and accuracy of safety data repositories is essential in safety-critical systems. In many systems, however, significant effort is required to identify, address, clean and repair data errors and inconsistencies, and to integrate safety data sets and repositories, particularly for risk analyses. Although some self healing and self repairing capabilities leveraging machine learning and predictive analyses have been employed to identify anomalies and monitor quality in structured safety-critical data sets, little attention has been focused on addressing shortcomings in heterogeneous—structured and unstructured—safety data sets, the focus of this work. The text mining and classification analysis employed in this research indicates that machine learning techniques can be employed to improve the accuracy and robustness of large-scale structured and unstructured database repositories, and to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of safety data repository maintenance. Hybrid machine learning approaches, leveraging machine learning, text mining and natural language processing, offer additional promise in future work.","Classification,Accident,Safety critical systems,Risk analysis,Text mining,Databases,"
"a data mining method to extract traffic network for maritime transport management","2023","Maritime traffic network is essential for navigation efficiency and safety of the maritime transport system. This study proposes a framework for extracting maritime traffic network based on Automatic Identification System (AIS) data. The framework consists of maritime traffic pattern recognition, semantic routes extraction, route decomposition, and network generation. Firstly, a data-driven method is introduced to recognize ship behavior patterns and extends the single ship behaviors to regional characteristics to determine the departure-arrival areas. Then, based on the different combination of departure-arrival areas, the ship trajectories are classified to traffic groups. Subsequently, the grid-system is used to rasterize each traffic group, which realizes the fusion of trajectory data and geographic location information. Finally, to obtain the main routes and navigation channels, the extraction method is introduced by establishing the cumulative grid importance function. The main routes, together with the navigation channels, compose the maritime traffic network. The method is applied to AIS data in the Beibu Gulf, and the results show that the traffic network contains 12 stop areas, 4 entry/exit locations, 13 main routes as well as their corresponding navigation channels. It is therefore concluded that the proposed method helps (1) provide a theoretical framework to obtain and analyze the maritime traffic network and (2) enrich navigation channel identification methods for maritime transport management.","Maritime traffic network,Maritime transport management,AIS,Machine learning,Big data analytics,"

"weather-aware object detection method for maritime surveillance systems","2023","The development of machine learning-based maritime object detection technology aims to assist ship operators in maritime surveillance. However, as maritime environments can be quite complex, developing object detection models that can handle these situations is a challenging research problem, particularly when dealing with adverse weather conditions like rain and haze. While prior research has attempted to remove weather noise and improve object detection models under various weather conditions, they are limited by computing resources and hard to adapt to the constantly changing weather conditions of maritime environments. Preventing performance degradation as weather conditions shift is a significant challenge in maritime surveillance systems. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a weather-aware object detection method, Weather-OD, that employs an on-board edge and on-shore cloud-based system for maritime surveillance. It employs specialized machine learning models for object detection, which can be dynamically selected based on the weather conditions to ensure highly accurate object detection with low latency at sea. Weather-OD continuously improves accuracy by periodically training the models with newly collected datasets during voyages, and efficiently manages the life cycle of multiple object detection models, taking into account the constraints of limited edge computing resources. In addition, Weather-OD uses synthetic image data with weather noise to supplement the training data under different weather conditions. We conducted an evaluation of our weather-aware object detection models using a maritime benchmark dataset, the Singapore Maritime Dataset. Our experimental results demonstrated the feasibility of our mechanism with weather classification and a significant improvement in the mean Average Precision (mAP) of maritime object detection in rainy and hazy conditions. Additionally, our approach enables the continuous improvement of object detection accuracy through model retraining with small datasets.","Edge cloud,Maritime surveillance,Weather-aware,Object detection,Adaptation,Model specialization,"

"real-time infrared horizon detection in maritime and land environments based on hyper-laplace filter and convolutional neural network","2023","The infrared (IR) horizon is an essential reference for near-ground state awareness and target detection. The traditional horizon detection algorithms based on hand-crafted features claim the advantage of being intuitive and highly targeted, however, their capability of detail extraction and robustness is not strong enough when switching among diverse scenes, meanwhile, the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have the powerful ability in feature acquisition, but has the disadvantages of interpretability and instability. Given this, this article proposes a novel horizon detection algorithm that combines the traditional method and CNN. First, the hyper-Laplace filter (HLF) is proposed to eliminate the interferences and enhance the saliency of the target. Then a positioning module (PM) based on the traditional idea which fully utilizes the structural characteristics of multifeature-maps in CNN is present to extract the endpoints of the horizon. Finally, an auxiliary module that consists of a revise branch (RB) and self-attention module (SAM) is designed to assist the PM with detailed corrections. Compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms, experiments based on three datasets with more than 25000 frames under various scenes demonstrate that the proposed algorithm not only achieves the best accuracy and highest stability but also addresses real-time needs. Notably, the detection deviation is controlled within 2 pixels on all three datasets while achieving a comparable detection speed of 170 frames/s. Besides, our algorithm also shows strong robustness even under harsh sea conditions and urban backgrounds.

"comparison of detectability of ship wake components between c-band and x-band synthetic aperture radar sensors operating under different slant ranges","2023","The detectability of wake components is affected by influencing parameters, which can be categorized into ship properties, environmental conditions and image acquisition settings. The characteristics of influences of most influencing parameters on the detectability are established. However, a consequent investigation and systematization of influences regarding differences in settings of various SARs have not been published. In this study, data from four different SARs missions, namely TerraSAR–X (TSX), CosmoSkymed (CSK), Sentinel–1 (S1) and RADARSAT–2 (RS2), were collected and analyzed with focus on detectability of ship wake components. The sensors operate on different orbit altitudes and radar frequency bands: TSX and CSK work with X–Band, S1 and RS2 work with C–Band. Using methods from the field of Data Science, the detectability of wake components is modelled for each of the four sensors using machine leaning by the support vector machine (SVM) method. The created SVM-models are then compared in order to derive statements regarding relative detectability of individual wake components. A measure of detectability model’s uncertainty and an alternative analysis based on accumulated backscattering statistics is presented to support the derived statements. In conclusion, sensors with shorter slant ranges and X–Band in comparison to C–Band were found to be better suited for the detection of ship wakes. However, these characteristics only hold for wake components detectable due to the Bragg scattering mechanism, i.e. Kelvin wake arms and V-narrow wakes. No significant difference for near and far field of turbulent wakes is recognized.","Ship wake detection,Synthetic aperture radar,Maritime object detection,Detectability modelling,Machine learning,"

The necessity of establishing sustainable road freight transportation plans have emerged for businesses. Therefore, it is important to develop decision support models that can be used by managers for sustainable road freight transportation. The objective of study is to predict the profit margin given to customers for freight trucking in sustainable road transportation. For this purpose, the variables affecting the profit margin to be given to the customers in sustainable road freight transportation are determined in the light of experts and managers. A data framework has been created using three-dimensional sustainability factors and customer-based variables. A machine learning-based methodology is developed. The scenario-based empirical investigation has been performed. Two different streams have been developed. The first stream is based on traditional importance analysis and second stream considers Recency, Frequency and Monetary based feature engineering and Discrete Wavelet Transform for noise reduction. Three different machine learning algorithms which are Random Forest, Robust Regression and XGBoost used for these two streams. Six different scenarios are considered. Finally, the proposed methodology is applied to two sustainable road freight transportation firms in Turkey. It is aimed to achieve the best performance for profit margin prediction analysis along with demonstrating that the proposed approach provides higher evaluation accuracy. The benchmarking results revealed the superiority of the proposed approach, which trained and tested the prediction model using the stream of data coming from a combination of Discrete Wavelet Transform and feature extraction. The benchmarking and comparisons enact that enhanced XGBoost algorithms provides the best prediction result. This paper presents a novel approach to predict customer-based profit margin in sustainable road freight transportation sector by combining different machine-learning methods for the first time.

As the input indices for the deep machine learning (DML) algorithm, wavelet singular amounts are used as an alternative method of detecting FDI attacks (FDIAs). By means of the suggested approach, a specified error is used to adjust the precision factors of the wavelet transform and subsequently, singular value decomposition is used to retrieve features from wavelet coefficients. The wavelet singular values in switching surfaces of current and voltage are used to determine the indexes used for DML and diagnosing FDIA.

"cae: contextual auto-encoder for multivariate time-series anomaly detection in air transportation","2022","The Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast protocol is one of the latest compulsory advances in air surveillance. While it supports the tracking of the ever-growing number of aircraft in the air, it also introduces cybersecurity issues that must be mitigated e.g., false data injection attacks where an attacker emits fake surveillance information. The recent data sources and tools available to obtain flight tracking records allow the researchers to create datasets and develop Machine Learning models capable of detecting such anomalies in En-Route trajectories. In this context, we propose a novel multivariate anomaly detection model called Contextual Auto-Encoder (CAE). It uses the baseline of a regular LSTM-based auto-encoder but with several decoders, each getting data of a specific flight phase (e.g. climbing, cruising or descending) during its training. To illustrate the CAE’s efficiency, an evaluation dataset was created using real-life anomalies as well as realistically crafted trajectory modifications, with which the CAE as well as three anomaly detection models from the literature were evaluated. Results show that the CAE achieves better results in both accuracy and speed of detection. The dataset, the models implementations and the evaluation results are available in an online repository, thereby enabling replicability and facilitating future experiments.","Air traffic security,Anomaly detection,Multivariate time series,CAE,ADS-B,"
"detection of invalid ais messages using machine learning techniques","2022","Coastal nations monitor maritime activities in the interest of defence, security, and safety. This form of monitoring typically occurs at operations centers that visualize the maritime environment by creating a Recognized Maritime Picture (RMP) covering a particular area of interest. The creation of this picture changed drastically with the introduction of the Automatic Identification System (AIS). AIS messages are known to contain numerous types of errors and in April 2020 a unique error was found in the data stream. This error consisted of messages indicating the appearance of over 200 vessels in the North Atlantic taking part in a yacht race when in fact no race or physical ships existed. The following work explores the application of various machine learning (ML) techniques to help identify these types of fabricated AIS messages. Specific ML techniques were explored including: K-means clustering, Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Feed-Forward Neural Networks (FNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and One-Class Support Vector Machines (One-SVM). The results showed that DT, RF, and FNN best identified the fabricated AIS messages with F1 scores greater than 93 percent on the test data.","maritime domain awareness,AIS,automatic identification system,machine learning,"
"adaptive detection tracking system for autonomous uav maritime patrolling","2020","Nowadays, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are considered reliable systems, suitable for several autonomous applications, especially for target detection and tracking. Although significant developments were achieved in object detection systems over the last decades using the deep learning technique known as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), there are still research gaps in this area. In this paper, we present a new object detection-tracking algorithm that can be used on low power consuming processing boards. In particular, we analysed a specific application scenario in which a UAV patrols coastlines and autonomously classifies different kind of marine objects. Current state of the art solutions propose centralised architectures or flying systems with human in the loop, making the whole system poorly efficient and not scalable. On the contrary, applying a Deep Learning detection system that runs on commercial Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) makes UAVs potentially more efficient than humans (especially for dull tasks like coastline patrolling) and the whole system becomes easily scalable because each UAV can fly independently and the Ground Control Station does not represent a bottleneck. To deal with this task, a database consisting of more than 115000 images was created to train and test several CNN architectures. Furthermore, an adaptive detection-tracking algorithm was introduced to make the whole system faster by optimizing the balancing between detecting new objects and tracking existing targets. The proposed solution is based on the measure of the tracking confidence and the frame similarity, by means of the Structural SIMilarity (SSIM) index, computed both globally and locally. Finally, the developed algorithms were tested on a realistic scenario by means of a UAV test-bed.","unmanned aerial vehicles,coastline patrolling,target detection,robot vision,adaptive detection tracking,Machine learning,Feature extraction,target tracking,service robots,object detection tracking,CNN,deep learning detection system,graphics processing units,Target tracking,object detection,pinhole camera model,image classification,autonomous UAV maritime patrolling,neural net architecture,convolutional neural nets,autonomous aerial vehicles,convolutional neural networks,Training,Convolutional neural networks,Unmanned aerial vehicles,CNN architectures,Detection-Tracking System,structural similarity index,autonomous classification,learning (artificial intelligence),Detectors,UAV,"

"red tide detection based on high spatial resolution broad band optical satellite data","2022","Red tide, one of the major ecological disasters in the world, exerts great impact on the marine environment. The ocean color satellite data with low spatial resolution and high spectral resolution is often used for red tide detection, but is insufficient for the fine-scale red tide detection due to its coarse spatial resolution. To address this problem, a new red tide detection method based on pseudo hue angle (PHA-RI) for high spatial resolution broad band satellite data is proposed in this paper. Different from the standard International Commission on Illumination (CIE) system, the false-color bands of near infrared (NIR), red and green are used to calculate the CIE tristimulus X, Y, Z, instead of the true-color bands of red, green and blue. With this method, the red tide can be easily differentiated from non-red tide water, and the distinction between red tide and non-red tide water is doubled compared to that of true-color bands composite. Experiment results show that the PHA-RI method can effectively detect red tide, with an averaged overall accuracy, F1-score and precision of 92%, 0.92 and 0.92 respectively. Compared with the traditional machine learning method support vector machine (SVM) and spectral index algorithm Gaofen-1 (GF-1) red tide detection index (GF-RI), the proposed algorithm has obvious advantages in red tide detection, especially for the strip distributed red tide. Besides, the proposed algorithm has good applicability, and it is proved to be suitable for the detection of red tides with different dominant species including Noctiluca scintillans, Skeletonema costatum and Heterosigma akashiide. Also, it is applicable to different broad band sensors, such as Chinese satellites GF-1 Wide Field of View (WFV), Haiyang 1D (HY-1D) Coastal Zone Imager (CZI), Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI). The application experiment indicates that the proposed algorithm is effective in red tide detection, and it can successfully detect fine-scale red tide events, which have not been detected by Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Aqua due to its coarse spatial resolution. The results also shows the advantages of high spatial resolution satellites in fine-scale red tide detection. This work provides a method for red tide detection using high spatial resolution broad band satellite data.","Pseudo hue angle,Detection method,Red tide,Remote sensing,Broad band sensor,"

"a big data analytics method for the evaluation of ship - ship collision risk reflecting hydrometeorological conditions","2021","This paper presents a big data analytics method for the evaluation of ship-ship collision risk in real operational conditions. The approach makes use of big data from Automatic Identification System (AIS) and nowcast data corresponding to time-dependent traffic situations and hydro-meteorological conditions respectively. An Avoidance Behavior-based Collision Detection Model (ABCD-M) is introduced to identify potential collision scenarios and Collision Risk Indices (CRIs) are quantified when evasive actions are taken for each detected collision scenario in various voyages. The method is applied on Ro-Pax ships operating over 13 months of the ice-free period in the Gulf of Finland. Results indicate that collision risk estimates may be extremely diverse among voyages, and in 97.5% of potential collision scenarios the evasive actions are triggered only when risk is at 45% or more of its maximum value. The overall CRI for ships operating over the given area tends to be lower for adverse hydro-meteorological conditions. It is therefore concluded that the proposed method may assist with the (1) identification of critical scenarios in various voyages not currently accounted for by existing accident databases, (2) definition of commonly agreed risk criteria to set off alarms, (3) the estimation of risk profile over the life cycle of fleet operations.","Gulf of Finland,Maritime operations,Ship safety,Machine learning,Collisions,Big data analytics,"

The highlights of the campaigns include improved prediction of equatorial spread-F (ESF) based on a ‘new factor’ combining the strength and asymmetry of the equatorial ionization anomaly (EIA); simultaneous detection of quasi-2-day wave at both E and F region heights; tomographic image showing a Traveling Ionospheric Disturbance (TID) in association with a counter electrojet (CEJ) event—all highlighting the neutral and electrodynamical coupling of the equatorial ionosphere−thermosphere regions; an unusual lowering of mesospheric temperature during a moderate geomagnetic storm—highlighting a new space weather effect; diurnal tide showing a peak amplitude of 35m/s at 45km in zonal wind and a significantly lower amplitude (∼15m/s) in the meridional wind and also evidence of convective activity in the lower atmosphere influencing the tidal variability in the Mesosphere−Lower Thermosphere (MLT) region highlighting the vertical coupling of the atmospheric regions.

"a cnn-lstm network for augmenting target detection in real maritime wide area surveillance radar data","2020","Typical radar detectors exploit only a small proportion of the valuable information contained in radar reflections, i.e. magnitude and Doppler. A neural network-based approach for augmenting traditional radar detector structures using machine learning (ML) is proposed in this paper. Specifically, the network is designed to augment target detection in the field of maritime wide area surveillance for non-coherent data. A combination network consisting of a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract spatial features and a long short-term memory (LSTM) for extracting temporal patterns in the spatial features is proposed. The network augments the detector structure by blanking out regions of the frame which are classified as not containing a target, thus reducing false alarms. The network is tested on data containing four marine targets collected by a ground-based radar. The data set was chosen because it contains strong sea clutter returns. When ML is used, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves are shifted to lower probability of false alarm (PFA). A Kalman filter tracker was applied to the ML-augmented and baseline detections, and it was shown that ML-augmented detections produced similar tracks at lower PFA. The feature discovering capability of the network is analyzed through a series of tests, and the argument is made that the CNN-LSTM network presented in this work demonstrates the ability to improve the detection performance by exploiting spatial and temporal information in the data.","real maritime wide area surveillance radar data,detector structure,Kalman filters,marine radar,baseline detections,radar detection,radar clutter,CNN-LSTM network,Feature extraction,ML-augmented detections,LSTM,target detection augmentation,neural nets,target tracking,short-term memory,wide area surveillance radar,Artificial neural networks,CNN,noncoherent data,maritime surveillance,object detection,feature extraction,combination network,search radar,data set,radar imaging,convolutional neural network,detection performance,ground-based radar,neural network-based approach,radar detectors,radar tracking,radar reflections,temporal information,marine targets,probability,Clutter,Object detection,false alarm,traditional radar detector structures,learning (artificial intelligence),spatial features,Detectors,Radar detection,spatial information,"

"improving maritime traffic emission estimations on missing data with crbms","2020","Maritime traffic emissions are a major concern to governments as they heavily impact the Air Quality in coastal cities. Ships use the Automatic Identification System (AIS) to continuously report position and speed among other features, and therefore this data is suitable to be used to estimate emissions, if it is combined with engine data. However, important ship features are often inaccurate or missing. State-of-the-art complex systems, like CALIOPE at the Barcelona Supercomputing Center, are used to model Air Quality. These systems can benefit from AIS based emission models as they are very precise in positioning the pollution. Unfortunately, these models are sensitive to missing or corrupted data, and therefore they need data curation techniques to significantly improve the estimation accuracy. In this work, we propose a methodology for treating ship data using Conditional Restricted Boltzmann Machines (CRBMs) plus machine learning methods to improve the quality of data passed to emission models that can also be applied to other GPS and time-series problems. Results show that we can improve the default methods proposed to cover missing data. In our results, we observed that using our method the models boosted their accuracy to detect otherwise undetectable emissions. In particular, we used a real data-set of AIS data, provided by the Spanish Port Authority, to estimate that thanks to our method, the model was able to detect 45% of additional emissions, representing 152 tonnes of pollutants per week in Barcelona and propose new features that may enhance emission modeling.","CRBM,Data cleaning,Emission modeling,AIS,GPS,Ship time series,"

In this paper, a day-ahead prediction model based on the improved recognized patterns via fuzzy C-means clustering and nonlinear regression is proposed and discussed. The proposed indirect pattern recognition is carried out by taking advantage of the connotative incidence relation between fluctuation features and influencing factors. Considering the different temporal characteristics of hourly SEEC, this proposed model is applied in an office building with the scope to manage the day-ahead prediction of hourly HVAC subentry and hourly socket subentry. These are taken as the typical non-stationary sequence and typical stationary sequence respectively. Results show that the proposed pattern recognition is applicable for the non-stationary HVAC subentry, and a stable energy pattern can contribute to accurate predictions. Furthermore, the introduction of additional hourly meteorological parameters improves the accuracy via rolling prediction instead. Finally, the modeling adaptability and applicable implications are summarized for references of optimal building energy operation.","Subentry electric energy consumption,Pattern recognition,Office building,Energy prediction,Adaptability analysis,"

We discuss and detect the risk which may be caused by a ship passing close to a protected area. Based on information provided by fused data coming from a radar, an AIS and cameras, a rule-based classifier has been developed. It aims to analyse real-time data like position, speed and course in order to detect potential threats beforehand. The expert system developed here is built on a two-stage event detection where threats rules are aggregated from simple event detection.

"integrated machine learning and probabilistic degradation approach for vessel electric motor prognostics","2023","In the transition towards more sustainable ships, electric motors (EM) are being used in ship propulsion systems to reduce emissions and increase efficiency. The safe operation of ships is crucial, and prognostics and health management applications have emerged as effective solutions to transit towards monitored reliable systems. In this context, this paper presents a probabilistic EM prognostics model integrating data-driven operational models and physics-informed degradation models. Firstly, motor torque and winding temperature are estimated through connected machine learning models, which are based on operational and meteorological data. Operational and meteorological variables drive the EM degradation model and enable the analysis of EM degradation under different operational and environmental conditions. Subsequently, EM remaining useful life (RUL) is predicted within a probabilistic Monte-Carlo approach combining the thermal-stress model along with the associated uncertainties. The methodology is tested on a real case study of the OV Ryvingen vessel, with collected data during voyages along the Norwegian coast. Results confirm the validity of the designed RUL model showing that, under normal operation conditions, the degradation is mild, and the temperature measurement errors are important for RUL estimation.","Degradation,Uncertainty,Insulation,Prognostics,Machine learning,Electric motor,"

Machine learning methods are versatile tools to utilize and harness the hidden power of the data. Considering ever-growing adoption of machine learning as a data-driven decision-making tool, the port industry is far behind other modes of transportation in this transition. To fill the gap, we aimed to provide a comprehensive systematic literature review on this topic to analyze the previous research from different perspectives such as area of the application, type of application, machine learning method, data, and location of the study. Results showed that the number of articles in the field has been increasing annually, and the most prevalent use case of machine learning methods is to predict different port characteristics.

"a novel online multi-task learning for covid-19 multi-output spatio-temporal prediction","2023","In light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, predicting its trend would significantly impact decision-making. However, this is not a straightforward task due to three main difficulties: temporal autocorrelation, spatial dependency, and concept drift caused by virus mutations and lockdown policies. Although machine learning has been extensively used in related work, no previous research has successfully addressed all three challenges simultaneously. To overcome this challenge, we developed a novel online multi-task regression algorithm that incorporates a chain structure to capture spatial dependency, the ADWIN drift detector to adapt to concept drift, and the lag time series feature to capture temporal autocorrelation. We conducted several comparative experiments based on the number of daily confirmed cases in 20 areas in California and affiliated cities. The results from our experiments demonstrate that our proposed model is superior in adapting to concept drift in COVID-19 data and capturing spatial dependencies across various regions. This leads to a significant improvement in prediction accuracy when compared to existing state-of-the-art batch machine learning methods, such as N-Beats, DeepAR, TCN, and LSTM.","COVID-19 prediction,Online learning,Multi-task learning,Multivariate time series,"
"textual risk mining for maritime situational awareness","2014","In this paper, we propose an auxiliary Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) integrated system for maritime situational awareness (MSA) operations. We bring into account a new and influential asset - human intuition and perception - to the existing semi-automated decision support systems that mostly rely on numerical data collected by electronic sensors or cameras located either directly on the vessels or in the maritime command-and-control centers. For our project, we gathered weekly textual reports spanning twelve months from the United States Worldwide Threats to Shipping Reports repository that belongs to the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), We considered the maritime incident reports written by human operators as a valuable and accessible unstructured textual input source in which a span of text1 is called â€œriskâ€ if it expresses one of the following kinds of vessel incidents: fired, robbed, boarded, hijacked, attacked, chased, approached, kidnapped, boarding attempted, suspiciously approached or clashed with. Our approach benefits from probability distributions of some useful features annotated based on a list of lexicons that contain expressions denoting vessel types, risks types, risk associates, maritime geographical locations, dates and times. These distributions are captured and used to anchor the span of â€œrisksâ€ as they are described in the textual reports. After some preprocessing steps that include tokenization, named entity extraction and part-of-speech tagging, the textual risk mining system applies a variety of sequence classification algorithms, e.g., Conditional Random Fields, Conditional Markov Models and Hidden Markov Models in order to compare the risk classification performance. Empirical results show that our NLP/ML-based system can extract variable-length risk spans from the textual reports with about 90% correctness.","Markov processes,decision support systems,hidden Markov models,statistical distributions,tokenization,Risk management,attacked vessel incident,human intuition,Hidden Markov models,maritime geographical locations,conditional Markov models,maritime domain awareness,maritime command-and-control centers,Feature extraction,natural language processing,chased vessel incident,entity extraction,variable-length risk span extraction,maritime incident reports,maritime situational awareness,sequence classification algorithms,conditional random fields,robbed vessel incident,electronic sensors,United States worldwide threats to shipping reports repository,maritime situational awareness operation,fired vessel incident,marine safety,National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency,marine engineering,boarded vessel incident,feature annotation,machine learning,semiautomated decision support systems,cameras,part-of-speech tagging,risk management,NLP/ML-based system,Classification algorithms,probability distributions,risks types,risk classification performance,textual risk mining system,weekly textual reports,auxiliary ML,auxiliary machine learning,hijacked vessel incident,command and control systems,vessels,human perception,vessel types,MSA operation,kidnapped vessel incident,risk associates,risk detection,NGA,text analysis,boarding attempted vessel incident,approached vessel incident,Data mining,learning (artificial intelligence),sequence-based classifiers,"
"predictive maintenance leveraging machine learning for time-series forecasting in the maritime industry","2020","One of the key challenges in the maritime industry refers to minimizing the time a vessel cannot be utilized, which has multiple effects. The latter is addressed through maintenance approaches that however in many cases are not efficient in terms of cost and downtime. Predictive maintenance provides optimized maintenance scheduling offering extended vessel lifespan, coupled with reduced maintenance costs. As in several industries, including the maritime domain, an increasing amount of data is made available through the deployment and exploitation of data sources, such as on board sensors that provide real-time information. These data provide the required ground for analysis and thus support for various types of data-driven decision making. In the maritime domain, sensors are deployed on vessels to monitor their engines and data analysis tools are needed to assist engineers towards reduced operational risk through predictive maintenance solutions that are put in place. In this paper, we present an approach for anomaly detection on time-series data, utilizing machine learning on the vessels sensor data, in order to predict the condition of specific parts of the vessel's main engine and thus facilitate predictive maintenance. The novel characteristic of the proposed approach refers both to the inclusion of new innovative models to address the case of predictive maintenance in maritime and the combination of those different models, highlighting an improved result in terms of evaluation metrics.","time-series forecasting,predictive maintenance leveraging machine,optimized maintenance scheduling,maritime,vessel lifespan,data-driven decision making,Anomaly detection,anomaly detection,maintenance engineering,Machine learning,data sources,reduced maintenance costs,time-series,scheduling,time-series data,downtime,predictive maintenance,deep learning,Oils,data analysis,machine learning,Data models,maritime domain,real-time information,decision making,predictive maintenance solutions,time series,condition monitoring,permutation entropy,gradient boosting,Engines,maritime industry,Sensors,maintenance approaches,learning (artificial intelligence),Fuels,"
"a realistic and public dataset with rare undesirable real events in oil wells","2019","Detection of undesirable events in oil and gas wells can help prevent production losses, environmental accidents, and human casualties and reduce maintenance costs. The scarcity of measurements in such processes is a drawback due to the low reliability of instrumentation in such hostile environments. Another issue is the absence of adequately structured data related to events that should be detected. To contribute to providing a priori knowledge about undesirable events for diagnostic algorithms in offshore naturally flowing wells, this work presents an original and valuable dataset with instances of eight types of undesirable events characterized by eight process variables. Many hours of expert work were required to validate historical instances and to produce simulated and hand-drawn instances that can be useful to distinguish normal and abnormal actual events under different operating conditions. The choices made during this dataset's preparation are described and justified, and specific benchmarks that practitioners and researchers can use together with the published dataset are defined. This work has resulted in two relevant contributions. A challenging public dataset that can be used as a benchmark for the development of (i) machine learning techniques related to inherent difficulties of actual data, and (ii) methods for specific tasks associated with detecting and diagnosing undesirable events in offshore naturally flowing oil and gas wells.

"synteo: synthetic dataset generation for earth observation and deep learning – demonstrated for offshore wind farm detection","2022","With the emergence of deep learning in the last years, new opportunities arose in Earth observation research. Nevertheless, they also brought with them new challenges. The data-hungry training processes of deep learning models demand large, resource expensive, annotated datasets and partly replaced knowledge-driven approaches so that model behaviour and the final prediction process became a black box. The proposed SyntEO approach enables Earth observation researchers to automatically generate large deep learning ready datasets by merging existing and procedural data. SyntEO does this by including expert knowledge in the data generation process in a highly structured manner to control the automatic image and label generation by employing an ontology. In this way, fully controllable experiment environments are set up, which support insights in the model training on the synthetic datasets. Thus, SyntEO makes the learning process approachable, which is an important cornerstone for explainable machine learning. We demonstrate the SyntEO approach by predicting offshore wind farms in Sentinel-1 images on two of the worlds largest offshore wind energy production sites. The largest generated dataset has 90,000 training examples. A basic convolutional neural network for object detection, that is only trained on this synthetic data, confidently detects offshore wind farms by minimising false detections in challenging environments. In addition, four sequential datasets are generated, demonstrating how the SyntEO approach can precisely define the dataset structure and influence the training process. SyntEO is thus a hybrid approach that creates an interface between expert knowledge and data-driven image analysis.","Offshore wind farm,Explainable machine learning,Synthetic training data,Deep learning,SyntEO,CNN,"
"dbscan algorithm for ais data reconstruction","2021","Automatic Identification System (AIS) is a telecommunication system created to allow ships to communicate with each other by exchanging messages containing information such as vessel’s ID, position, speed, heading, etc. AIS is useful in many cases, such as early ship collision detection. However, its terrestrial segment’s drawback is a relatively low range (about 74 km, roughly 40 nautical miles). Satellite Automatic Identification System (SAT-AIS) was introduced to overcome this limitation, but it suffers from its own problem known as packet collision. The satellite receives messages from multiple terrestrial cells and communication is synchronized within such cells, but not between them, thus messages got lost or damaged when they appear at the satellite at the same time. In this paper, we present a machine learning-based approach to reconstruct those missing messages and deeply investigate whether or not a density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) can be considered in the first stage of the reconstruction. The experiment focuses on findig the optimal parameters for the clustering, running it both on original and damaged data to finally ascertain that DSBCAN can distinguish individual trajectories in a dataset that can be further reconstructed.","clustering,DBSCAN,AIS data analysis,trajectory reconstruction,AIS,"
"a machine learning-based accuracy enhancement on eumetsat h-saf h35 effective snow-covered area product","2022","Snow is a major element of the cryosphere with significant impact on the Earth's water cycle and global energy budget. Acquiring consistent and long time series data on the spatial extent of snow cover doubtlessly plays a key role in our understanding and modeling of the current and future environmental dynamics. Remote sensing offers a powerful tool for continuous retrieval of snow cover information by utilizing snow's contrasting reflectance characteristics at optical wavelengths. The pre-operational H35 covers the Northern Hemisphere, and it is the successor of the operational Pan-European H12 daily fractional snow-covered area (fSCA) product at ~1 km. Both products are developed through the Satellite Application Facility on Support to Operational Hydrology and Water Management (H-SAF) project of EUMETSAT by exploiting AVHRR channels. This study is focused on developing an alternative fully data-driven H35 product with improved accuracy using a machine learning (ML)-based approach. Multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) algorithm is trained by using AVHRR reflectance data as well as the well-known snow and vegetation indices (i.e., NDSI and NDVI) to generate the new version of H35 fSCA product. The reference fSCA maps required for the training of MARS models are obtained from the higher resolution Sentinel 2 multispectral imagery. The MARS-based fSCA models are validated against an initial test dataset composed of 15 Sentinel 2 scenes over European Alps, Tatra Mountain Range, and Turkey. The final MARS-H35 product is then rigorously assessed over the whole Northern Hemisphere within a temporal domain spanning from Nov 2018 to Nov 2019. The quantitative testing process involves the use of reference data in both continuous and dichotomous scales: i) Sentinel 2 derived reference fSCA maps, ii) ERA5-Land snow depth data, iii) MODIS MOD10A1 NDSI snow cover data, and finally iv) in-situ snow depth data. Additionally, qualitative assessment is also performed by visually comparing MARS-H35/MODIS false-color and MARS-H35/Sentinel 2-derived reference fSCA image pairs over various geographic regions. The overall results indicate that: i) the proposed MARS-H35 fSCA product overperforms the original H35, and ii) it has higher capability in detecting the fine variations in the extent of snow cover, especially across the fringes of the slopes in complex mountainous terrains.","Multivariate adaptive regression splines,Sentinel 2,ERA5-Land,Remote sensing of the cryosphere,Fractional snow cover mapping,AVHRR,MODIS,"
"a comprehensive survey of clustering algorithms: state-of-the-art machine learning applications, taxonomy, challenges, and future research prospects","2022","Clustering is an essential tool in data mining research and applications. It is the subject of active research in many fields of study, such as computer science, data science, statistics, pattern recognition, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. Several clustering techniques have been proposed and implemented, and most of them successfully find excellent quality or optimal clustering results in the domains mentioned earlier. However, there has been a gradual shift in the choice of clustering methods among domain experts and practitioners alike, which is precipitated by the fact that most traditional clustering algorithms still depend on the number of clusters provided a priori. These conventional clustering algorithms cannot effectively handle real-world data clustering analysis problems where the number of clusters in data objects cannot be easily identified. Also, they cannot effectively manage problems where the optimal number of clusters for a high-dimensional dataset cannot be easily determined. Therefore, there is a need for improved, flexible, and efficient clustering techniques. Recently, a variety of efficient clustering algorithms have been proposed in the literature, and these algorithms produced good results when evaluated on real-world clustering problems. This study presents an up-to-date systematic and comprehensive review of traditional and state-of-the-art clustering techniques for different domains. This survey considers clustering from a more practical perspective. It shows the outstanding role of clustering in various disciplines, such as education, marketing, medicine, biology, and bioinformatics.

"eeg-based maritime object detection for iot-driven surveillance systems in smart ocean","2020","Automated maritime object detection is a significant research challenge in intelligent marine surveillance systems for the Internet of Things (IoT) and smart ocean applications. In particular, ship detection is recognized as one of the core research issues of these IoT-driven intelligent marine surveillance systems. Traditional methods based on machine learning have made some achievements in detection tasks for specific objects. However, the ship objects are relatively small, and they are usually not accurately detected. In this article, we propose an electroencephalography (EEG)-based maritime object detection algorithm for IoT-driven surveillance systems in the smart ocean. For this purpose, we conduct experiments to record the EEG signals of subjects when they are watching the maritime image scenes. With the feature analysis of EEG signals, the event-related potential (ERP) components associated with detecting objects are induced, such as the  $P3$  and  $N2$  components. Employing classification based on linear discriminant analysis (LDA), the area under curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) is used to evaluate the detection accuracy. We use this novel method to determine and identify essential objects and areas from IoT devices, such as digital camera imaging sensors.

As such, network intrusion detection systems must detect, evaluate, and respond to malicious cyber traffic at machine speed. Generative adversarial networks and variational autoencoders are fit as generative models with labeled cyber data from a real military enterprise network. These generative models are used to create realistic, synthetic cyber data. A combination of real and synthetic cyber data sets are then used to train several machine learning models for network intrusion detection. Purely synthetic data is shown to be statistically similar to the real data. There is no statistically significant difference in the performance of classifiers trained with real data versus a combination of real and synthetic data; however, classifiers trained with only synthetic data underperformed.

"structural health monitoring of harbor caissons using support vector machine and principal component analysis","2021","Harbor caissons are regarded as one of the most critical infrastructures, and any disruption in their operation would have dramatic economic consequences. The need for a health monitoring system for these structures is thus evident. The primary aim of this study is to develop a structural health monitoring (SHM) system to effectively detect damage in harbor caissons. To this end, through performing dynamic analysis, acceleration signals are extracted from the locations in the model corresponding to the presumed accelerometer's placement in an actual structure. Three levels of white Gaussian noises are added to the original signal to simulate the ambient noise. Using the acquired signals, the damage-sensitive features in both frequency and time domains are determined in the structure. In this study, leveraging Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Support Vector Machine (SVM), the damage-sensitive features associated with the damaged and undamaged structure are reduced in dimensionality and classified. Hence, the introduced system can assess the state of the structure based on the input signal from the accelerometer and detect possible damage and its severity.

Meanwhile, the IoT devices are resource-constrained and cannot implement the existing security systems, making them susceptible to various types of debilitating cyber-attacks. The dynamics in the attack processes in IoT-enabled MTS networks keep changing, which makes a traditional offline or batch ML-based attack detection systems intractable to apply. This paper provides a novel approach of using an adaptive incremental passive-aggressive machine learning (AI-PAML) method to create a network attack detection system (NADS) to protect the IoT devices in an MTS environment. In this paper, we propose an NADS that utilizes a multi-access edge computing (MEC) platform to provide computational resources to execute the proposed model at a network end. Since online learning models face data saturation problems, we present an improved approximate linear dependence and a modified hybrid forgetting mechanism to filter the inefficient data and keep the detection model up-to-date. The proposed data filtering ensures that the model does not experience a rapid increase in unwarranted data, which affects the modelâ€™s attack detection rate. A Markov transition probability is applied to control the MEC selection and data offloading process by the IoT devices. The performance of the NADS is verified using selected benchmark datasets and a realistic IoT environment.

It is evident that Automatic Identification System (AIS) data-driven ship trajectory prediction can effectively aid in identifying abnormal ship behaviours and reducing maritime risks such as collision, stranding, and contact. Furthermore, trajectory prediction is widely recognised as one of the critical technologies for realising safe autonomous navigation. The prediction methods and their performance are the key factors for future safe and automatic shipping. Currently, ship trajectory prediction lacks the real performance measurement and analysis of different algorithms, including classical machine learning and emerging deep learning methods. This paper aims to systematically analyse the performance of ship trajectory prediction methods and pioneer experimental tests to reveal their advantages and disadvantages as well as fitness in different scenarios involving complicated systems. To do so, five machine learning methods (i.e., Kalman Filter (KF), Support Vector Progression (SVR), Back Propagation network (BP), Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), and Random Forest (RF)) and seven deep learning methods (i.e., Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gate Recurrent Unit (GRU), Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM), Sequence to Sequence (Seq2seq), Bi-directional Gate Recurrent Unit (Bi-GRU), and Transformer) are first extracted from the state-of-the-art literature review and then employed to implement the trajectory prediction and compare their prediction performance in the real world. Three AIS datasets are collected from the waters of representative traffic features, including a normal channel (i.e., the Chengshan Jiao Promontory), complex traffic (i.e., the Zhoushan Archipelago), and a port area (i.e., Caofeidian port). They are selected to test and analyse the performance of all twelve methods based on six evaluation indexes and explore the characteristics and effectiveness of the twelve trajectory prediction methods in detail.

One of the main goals of data science in this context is to effectively predict abnormal behaviors in industrial machinery, tools and processes so as to anticipate critical events and damage, eventually causing important economical losses and safety issues. In this context, data-driven prognosis is gradually gaining attention in different industrial sectors. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of the recent developments in data fusion and machine learning for industrial prognosis, placing an emphasis on the identification of research trends, niches of opportunity and unexplored challenges. To this end, a principled categorization of the utilized feature extraction techniques and machine learning methods will be provided on the basis of its intended purpose: analyze what caused the failure (descriptive), determine when the monitored asset will fail (predictive) or decide what to do so as to minimize its impact on the industry at hand (prescriptive). This threefold analysis, along with a discussion on its hardware and software implications, intends to serve as a stepping stone for future researchers and practitioners to join the community investigating on this vibrant field.","Industry 4.0,Machine learning,Data-driven prognosis,Data fusion,"
"data-driven trajectory quality improvement for promoting intelligent vessel traffic services in 6g-enabled maritime iot systems","2021","Future generation communication systems, such as 5G and 6G wireless systems, exploit the combined satellite-terrestrial communication infrastructures to extend network coverage and data throughput for data-driven applications. These ground-breaking techniques have promoted the rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT) in maritime industries. In maritime IoT applications, intelligent vessel traffic services can be guaranteed by collecting and analyzing high volume of spatial data flows from automatic identification system (AIS). This AIS system includes a highly integrated automatic equipment, including functionalities of core communication, tracking, and sensing. The increased utilization of shipboard AIS devices allows the collection of massive trajectory data. However, the received raw AIS data often suffers from undesirable outliers (i.e., poorly tracked timestamped points for vessel trajectories) during signal acquisition and analog-to-digital conversion. The degraded AIS data will bring negative effects on vessel traffic services (e.g., maritime traffic monitoring, intelligent maritime navigation, vessel collision avoidance, etc.) in maritime IoT scenarios. To improve the quality of vessel trajectory records from AIS networks, we propose to develop a two-phase data-driven machine learning framework for vessel trajectory reconstruction. In particular, a density-based clustering method is introduced in the first phase to automatically recognize the undesirable outliers. The second phase proposes a bidirectional long short-term memory (BLSTM)-based supervised learning technique to restore the timestamped points degraded by random outliers in vessel trajectories. Comprehensive experiments on simulated and realistic data sets have verified the dominance of our two-phase vessel reconstruction framework compared to other competing methods. It thus has the capacity of promoting intelligent vessel traffic services in 6G-enabled maritime IoT systems.","short-term memory-based supervised learning technique,maritime traffic monitoring,recurrent neural nets,supervised learning technique,intelligent maritime navigation,data-driven applications,AIS networks,Internet of Things,Monitoring,neural networks,6G-enabled maritime IoT systems,vessel collision avoidance,time stamped point restoration,shipboard AIS devices,BLSTM,two-phase vessel reconstruction framework,spatial data,5G mobile communication,automatic identification system,maritime IoT applications,supervised learning,vessel traffic services,signal reconstruction,intelligent vessel traffic services,6G mobile communication,pattern clustering,vessel trajectories,Artificial intelligence,analogue-digital conversion,two-phase data-driven machine,raw AIS data system,telecommunication traffic,maritime Internet of Things (IoT),6G wireless systems,integrated automatic equipment,Trajectory,signal detection,vessel trajectory reconstruction,marine communication,automatic identification system (AIS),Navigation,maritime industries,bidirectional long short-term memory,combined satellite-terrestrial communication,data-driven trajectory quality improvement,massive trajectory data,future generation communication systems,"
"research progress on ship anomaly detection based on big data","2020","The purpose of ship behavior anomaly detection is to identify and monitor some non-expected behaviors of ships, so as to improve the navigation safety of ships. Its research is of great significance to the safety guarantee of maritime navigation, intelligent monitoring of sea areas and the development of port management. This paper summarizes and evaluates the research progress of ship anomaly detection based on big data and points out the future development trend. First of all, the concept of ship abnormal behavior is introduced, and the process of data-driven ship abnormal detection and its data basis are described in detail. Secondly, the data-driven ship anomaly detection methods are divided into statistical method, machine learning method and neural network method, and their research status and existing problems are reviewed respectively.

"data gap analysis of ship and maritime data using meta learning","2021","With the developments in new Internet of Things (IoT) technology, ship owners and managers can access and analyze vast amounts of real-time onboard data. However, data collected from the ship’s engine and navigation information include various types of errors owing to imprecision, bias, sensor failure, or human error caused by manual recording by the ship operator’s hands. Such abnormal data make accurate ship performance prediction and monitoring difficult; thus, the original data need to be carefully refined through data preprocessing. Machine learning models have been used to detect and remove abnormal data; however, this yields inconsistent predictions in results depending on the types of machine learning models used. In this study, a robust data gap analysis method is proposed to detect abnormal data among ship and marine data collected in real time. Data preprocessing, including rule-based data imputation, clustering, denoising, and dimension reduction, is systematically performed; subsequently, a meta-learning model, which is a combination of various machine learning models, is used to predict ship performance and detect its abnormal data. This study compared the performance of single-machine learning models and meta models through various error analysis methods that utilize actual ship operation data. The single machine leading models have various error values depending on types of data and models, while the meta model consistently has values of less than 5% of mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and relative root-mean-square error (RRMSE), showing a Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient(NSE) value of 0.7 or higher. Our proposed data gap analysis framework, including the meta-learning model, can be useful for monitoring the condition of ships, as it can more accurately and robustly classify them as normal or abnormal.","Data preprocessing,Machine learning error measures,Meta learning,Data gap analysis,"
"multiple vessel detection and tracking in harsh maritime environments","2021","Recently, research concerning the navigation of Autonomous Surface Vehicles (ASVs) has been increasing.

"abnormal moving speed detection using combination of kernel density estimator and dbscan for coastal surveillance radars","2020","In this paper, we investigate the problem of detection of abnormal moving speeds for a coastal surveillance radar. A new definition of normal moving speeds which is based on the historical radar data of maritime targets on the monitoring area is introduced. The historical radar data is mined by the cell-based method, unsupervised machine learning to obtain the vessel normal moving speeds in the monitoring area. Then a logic rule is applied to detect the abnormal targets. The proposed method is tested with real data from a coastal surveillance radar. The test results show that the false alarm rate (FAR) is equal zero.

"early anomaly detection in smart home: a causal association rule-based approach","2018","As the world's population grows older, an increasing number of people are facing health issues. For the elderly, living alone can be difficult and dangerous. Consequently, smart homes are becoming increasingly popular. A sensor-rich environment can be exploited for healthcare applications, in particular, anomaly detection (AD). The literature review for this paper showed that few works consider environmental factors to detect anomalies. Instead, the focus is on user activity and checking whether it is abnormal, i.e., does not conform to expected behavior. Furthermore, reducing the number of anomalies using early detection is a major issue in many applications. In this context, anomaly-cause discovery may be helpful in recommending actions that may prevent risk. In this paper, we present a novel approach for detecting the risk of anomalies occurring in the environment regarding user activities. The method relies on anomaly-cause extraction from a given dataset using causal association rules mining. These anomaly causes are utilized afterward for real-time analysis to detect the risk of anomalies using the Markov logic network machine learning method. The detected risk allows the method to recommend suitable actions to perform in order to avoid the occurrence of an actual anomaly. The proposed approach is implemented, tested, and evaluated for each contribution using real data obtained from an intelligent environment platform and real data from a clinical datasets. Experimental results prove our approach to be efficient in terms of recognition rate.","Anomaly detection,Markov logic network,Smart homes,Causal association rules,"
"maritime situation analysis framework: vessel interaction classification and anomaly detection","2015","Maritime domain awareness is critical for protecting sea lanes, ports, harbors, offshore structures like oil and gas rigs and other types of critical infrastructure against common threats and illegal activities. Typical examples range from smuggling of drugs and weapons, human trafficking and piracy all the way to terror attacks. Limited surveillance resources constrain maritime domain awareness and compromise full security coverage at all times. This situation calls for innovative intelligent systems for interactive situation analysis to assist marine authorities and security personal in their routine surveillance operations. In this article, we propose a novel situation analysis approach to analyze marine traffic data and differentiate various scenarios of vessel engagement for the purpose of detecting anomalies of interest for marine vessels that operate over some period of time in relative proximity to each other. We consider such scenarios as probabilistic processes and analyze complex vessel trajectories using machine learning to model common patterns. Specifically, we represent patterns as left-to-right Hidden Markov Models and classify them using Support Vector Machines. To differentiate suspicious activities from unobjectionable behavior, we explore fusion of data and information, including kinematic features, geospatial features, contextual information and maritime domain knowledge. Our experimental evaluation shows the effectiveness of the proposed approach using comprehensive real-world vessel tracking data from coastal waters of North America.","Kinematics,surveillance,hidden Markov models,interactive situation analysis,Hidden Markov models,Geospatial analysis,anomaly detection,Anomaly Detection,maritime domain awareness,marine traffic data analysis,data fusion,information fusion,data analysis,Maritime Domain Awareness,vessel engagement,routine surveillance operations,marine engineering,support vector machines,kinematic features,probabilistic processes,geospatial features,machine learning,left-to-right hidden Markov models,vessel interaction classification,innovative intelligent systems,pattern classification,contextual information,Time series analysis,maritime situation analysis framework,Critical Infrastructure Protection,Big Data,vessel tracking data,Trajectory,Machine Learning,probability,complex vessel trajectory analysis,pattern representation,traffic engineering computing,Surveillance,maritime domain knowledge,marine vehicles,Intelligent Systems,learning (artificial intelligence),Security,security,"
"improved tropical deep convective cloud detection using modis observations with an active sensor trained machine learning algorithm","2023","Tropical deep convective clouds (DCCs) play an essential role in the Earth system. However, separating DCCs from thick anvils with satellite passive measurements is challenging. In this work, a day/night unified tropical DCC detection approach for MODIS observations is developed with a CloudSat active sensor measurement trained machine learning model. This approach combines brightness temperatures (BTs) at 6.7 μm (BT6.7) and 11 μm (BT11) with derived variables describing horizontal structures of DCCs and improves the tropical DCC probability of detection (POD) from 45.0% for the widely-used BT11 < 215 K method to 67.9%, while the false alarm ratio (FAR) decreases from 43.9% to 32.6%. The Heidke skill score (HSS) of the new algorithm is 0.425, which is more than doubled compared to the HSS of the BT11 < 215 K method (0.182). Moreover, the new algorithm has small biases in DCC's total amount and spatial distribution compared with the CloudSat results. The monthly DCC variations from MODIS wide-swath measurements with the new algorithm demonstrate the ability to reliably provide high temporal and spatial resolution DCC distributions to support intra-seasonal to interannual climate variability studies, which the CloudSat narrow-swath measurements lack enough samples to do. Meanwhile, the new algorithm can also be applied to measurements from other satellite passive sensors when BT6.7 and BT11 are available.","Passive measurements,Tropical convective cloud detection,CloudSat,Horizontal structure,CALIPSO,Machine learning,MODIS,"

"an automated treatment plan alert system to safeguard cancer treatments in radiation therapy","2022","In radiation oncology, the intricate process of delivering radiation to a patient is detailed by the patient’s treatment plan, which is data describing the geometry, construction and strength of the radiation machine and the radiation beam it emits. The patient’s life depends upon the accuracy of the treatment plan, which is left in the hands of the vendor-specific software automatically generating the plan after an initial patient consultation and planning with a medical professional. However, corrupted and erroneous treatment plan data have previously resulted in severe patient harm when errors go undetected and radiation proceeds. The aim of this paper is to develop an automatic error-checking system to prevent the accidental delivery of radiation treatment to an area of the human body (i.e., the treatment site) that differs from the plan’s documented intended site. To this end, we develop a method for structuring treatment plan data in order to feed machine-learning (ML) classifiers and predict a plan’s treatment site. In practice, a warning may be raised if the prediction disagrees with the documented intended site. The contribution of this paper is in the strategic structuring of the complex, intricate, and nonuniform data of modern treatment planning and from multiple vendors in order to easily train ML algorithms. A three-step process utilizing up- and down-sampling and dimension reduction, the method we develop in this paper reduces the thousands of parameters comprising a single treatment plan to a single two-dimensional heat map that is independent of the specific vendor or construction of the machine used for treatment. Our heat-map structure lends itself well to feed well-established ML algorithms, and we train–test random forest, softmax, k-nearest neighbors, shallow neural network, and support vector machine using real clinical treatment plans from several hospitals in the United States. The paper demonstrates that the proposed method characterizes treatment sites so well that ML classifiers may predict head-neck, breast, and prostate treatment sites with an accuracy of about 94%. The proposed method is the first step towards a thorough, fully automated error-checking system in radiation therapy.","Radiation heat map,Nonuniform treatment data,Cancer classification,"
"the future of the technology-based manufacturing in the european union","2023","The manufacturing industry tries to innovate always to cater to customer-oriented products. The digitization of manufacturing is revolutionizing the future of this industry. The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is bringing down the labor cost, reducing the machine downtime, and overall increasing the production speed. A new technological trend like Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that uses computer algorithms based on available data and can improve or decide further, automatically, based on experience, without the need for prior programming commands. ML can improve daily processes for identifying bottlenecks, developing products, controlling quality, providing security to the industry, and using AI robotics in place of humans. On one hand, technologies like ML, AI, IIoT, new materials, photonics, and rapid prototyping are driving the manufacturing sector in adopting a future version of Industry 4.0, and on the other hand, the European Commission (EC) has defined a roadmap until 2050 or more, in achieving the sustainable goal of carbon-neutrality and complete digitalization with resilience across the European continent. However, it is challenging to match the planned and actual roadmaps to the future of the technology-based manufacturing industry. There are uncertainties about how the future will be shaped by technologies in the EU manufacturing industry, in the changing political, environmental and social world environment. Recognizing these difficulties, the current article consults the available literature on this topic to determine the factors that will characterize the future of the manufacturing industry across EU countries. The relevant information about the EU manufacturing sectors has first been collected from various sources like Eurostat data, the EC policy documents, manufacturing company's annual reports, research reviews, journal articles, EU Industry Days annual event, etc. Then the collected data were analyzed to gain insight into the future of the technology-based EU manufacturing industry in the context of the European Commission's outlined policies. Variable factors from different manufacturing sectors are presented from different EU member states and scenario analysis was used for understanding the possible future. It is concluded that the future does not lie in adapting to the changing environment but in creating the future by EU companies themselves - revolution must be met by revolution. Their early experiences and path dependency can be seen as stubbornness, which may act as formidable barriers to building new capabilities. Therefore, companies must step-wise integrate resources to create a new process, and new structure, with personnel motivation, that fits with the broader European context in the coming decades.","Digitalization,Management,Carbon-neutrality,EU,Manufacturing,"

We here relate these concepts to the JDL fusion model and demonstrate the power of Markov Logic Networks (MLNs) for encoding uncertain knowledge and compute inferences according to observed evidence. MLNs combine the expressive power of first-order logic and the probabilistic uncertainty management of Markov networks. Within this framework, different types of knowledge (e.g. a priori, contextual) with associated uncertainty can be fused together for situation assessment by expressing unobservable complex events as a logical combination of simpler evidences. We also develop a mechanism to evaluate the level of completion of complex events and show how, along with event probability, it could provide additional useful information to the operator.

"ecg-biconet: an ecg-based pipeline for covid-19 diagnosis using bi-layers of deep features integration","2022","The accurate and speedy detection of COVID-19 is essential to avert the fast propagation of the virus, alleviate lockdown constraints and diminish the burden on health organizations. Currently, the methods used to diagnose COVID-19 have several limitations, thus new techniques need to be investigated to improve the diagnosis and overcome these limitations. Taking into consideration the great benefits of electrocardiogram (ECG) applications, this paper proposes a new pipeline called ECG-BiCoNet to investigate the potential of using ECG data for diagnosing COVID-19. ECG-BiCoNet employs five deep learning models of distinct structural design. ECG-BiCoNet extracts two levels of features from two different layers of each deep learning technique. Features mined from higher layers are fused using discrete wavelet transform and then integrated with lower-layers features. Afterward, a feature selection approach is utilized. Finally, an ensemble classification system is built to merge predictions of three machine learning classifiers. ECG-BiCoNet accomplishes two classification categories, binary and multiclass. The results of ECG-BiCoNet present a promising COVID-19 performance with an accuracy of 98.8% and 91.73% for binary and multiclass classification categories. These results verify that ECG data may be used to diagnose COVID-19 which can help clinicians in the automatic diagnosis and overcome limitations of manual diagnosis.","ECG trace Image,Discrete wavelet transform (DWT),Deep learning,COVID-19,Convolutional neural networks (CNN),"
"an unsupervised reconstruction-based fault detection algorithm for maritime components","2019","In recent years, the reliability and safety requirements of ship systems have increased drastically. This has prompted a paradigm shift toward the development of prognostics and health management (PHM) approaches for these systems' critical maritime components. In light of harsh environmental conditions with varying operational loads, and a lack of fault labels in the maritime industry generally, any PHM solution for maritime components should include independent and intelligent fault detection algorithms that can report faults automatically. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised reconstruction-based fault detection algorithm for maritime components. The advantages of the proposed algorithm are verified on five different data sets of real operational run-to-failure data provided by a highly regarded industrial company. Each data set is subject to a fault at an unknown time step. In addition, different magnitudes of random white Gaussian noise are applied to each data set in order to create several real-life situations.

"a-contrario structural inference for space object detection and tracking","2022","Monitoring space assets for safety and sustainability compliance requires active measurement of positional information, commonly done via optical remote sensing in which image-frame coordinates are extracted from a high-noise environment of stellar, atmospheric, and hardware features. This task has been traditionally approached by using a-priori models to differentiate potential Anthropogenic Space Objects from the background noise. Source extraction and track-before-detect methods rely on absolute pixel intensity thresholding and require substantial processing to remove noise (stars, hot pixels, etc.), while machine learning shows promise in reducing processing and improving low-visibility performance but requires context-specific labeled training data. We introduce a new approach based on a-contrario detection, arguing that any space object must be unattributable to noise using a sequence of low-fidelity hypotheses. Through this approach, we aim to relax the dependency on a-priori assumptions of data content and improve performance where high-quality data is sparse, poorly labeled, or challenging to characterize, e.g., in satellite-based applications, and provide detection confidence measures from individual data content to enhance risk evaluation for orbital populations. We present an initial qualitative proof-of-concept for our a-contrario approach using data collected by the ASTRIANet telescope network, showing potentially strong performance on Medium Earth Orbit observations for both rate and sidereal-tracking telescope modes. We also discuss how our approach handles epistemic uncertainties, i.e., a lack of a-priori model information, with implications to Type I and Type II error sources and potential mitigation steps when considering Low Earth Orbit observations with higher tracking noise.","Object tracking,A-contrario detection,Space domain awareness,Image processing,"

However, the efficacy of the predictive maintenance strategy relies on selecting the appropriate data processing method and ML model.

Hence, this survey reviews the recent literature on ML-driven condition monitoring systems that have been beneficial in many cases. Furthermore, in the reviewed literature, we provide an insight into the underlying findings on successful, intelligent condition monitoring systems. It is prudent to consider all factors when narrowing the search for the most effective model for a particular task.

"anomaly detection with unknown anomalies: application to maritime machinery","2021","We present a framework for deriving anomaly detection algorithms on timeseries data when the time and expression of anomalous behaviour is unknown. The framework is suited for problems in which individual machine learning paradigms cannot be directly implemented: supervised learning is not applicable due to the lack of labelled data, unsupervised learning is not effective since the normal operations are insufficiently defined and take complex and diverse forms, and deep learning risks confusing problematic behaviours for expected ones due to the possible repetitiveness of similar anomalies. The proposed approach is comprised of two phases: unsupervised discovery of anomalies, and semi-supervised construction and tuning of the anomaly detection algorithm. By leveraging data exploration methods and expert knowledge, the resulting algorithms are interpretable and detect a wide range of anomalous behaviours. The approach is applied to the early detection of wear and tear of maritime propulsion and manoeuvring machinery. We show that the final algorithm is able to detect different types of anomalies, including an actual internal leakage in a thruster which is otherwise overlooked by the present rule-based alarm system.","diagnosis,predictive maintenance,condition-based monitoring,machine learning,anomaly detection,grey-box modelling,fault detection,"

In this paper, we propose a new approach to detect botnet activity based on traffic behavior analysis by classifying network traffic behavior using machine learning. Traffic behavior analysis methods do not depend on the packets payload, which means that they can work with encrypted network communication protocols. Network traffic information can usually be easily retrieved from various network devices without affecting significantly network performance or service availability. We study the feasibility of detecting botnet activity without having seen a complete network flow by classifying behavior based on time intervals. Using existing datasets, we show experimentally that it is possible to identify the presence of existing and unknown botnets activity with high accuracy even with very small time windows.","Intrusion detection,Botnet,Network flows,Traffic behavior analysis,Machine learning,"

Therefore, this study innovatively uses PSC inspection data to design ship maintenance plans for ship operators to minimize overall operational costs. We identify three types of operational costs associated with each deficiency code: inspection cost, repair cost, and risk cost in the ship operators’ decision-making process. The risk cost of a deficiency code is strongly related to the detention contribution of the deficiency items under a deficiency code, as indicated by the feature importance of that code in the random forest (RF) model used to predict detention outcomes. To design ship maintenance plans, the sequential predict-then-optimize (PO) method typically solves the optimization problem using input parameters, including the predicted probabilities of having deficiency items under each code and the three types of operational costs. However, the loss function in this two-stage framework does not consider the effect of predictions on the downstream decisions. Hence, we use a smart predict-then-optimize (SPO) method using an ensemble of SPO trees (SPOTs). Each SPOT uses an SPO loss function that measures the sub-optimality of the decisions derived from the predicted parameters. By exploiting the structural properties of the optimization problem analyzed in this study, we demonstrate that training an SPOT for this problem can be simplified tremendously by using the relative class frequency of true labels within a leaf node to yield a minimum SPO loss. Computational experiments show that the SPO-based ship maintenance scheme is superior to other schemes and can reduce a ship's total operating expenses by approximately 1% over the PO-based scheme and by at least 3% over schemes that do not use machine learning methods. In the long run, SPO-based ship maintenance plans also improve the efficiency of port logistics by reducing the resources needed for formal PSC inspections and alleviating port congestion.","Prescriptive analytics,Data-driven optimization,Port state control (PSC) inspection,Ship maintenance planning,"

"association rules and social network analysis for supporting failure mode effects and criticality analysis: framework development and insights from an onshore platform","2022","The ongoing digital transformation enables the collection of a vast amount of data from the maintenance and production processes. Hence, the techniques traditionally applied for monitoring the operations and defining the maintenance approaches for improving the asset reliability can be accompanied by new methodologies more oriented to data analytics. In this context, this work proposes a data-driven framework for supporting the analysis of the production processes in terms of failures and related effects through the well-known and widely applied Failure Mode, Effect, and Criticality Analysis (FMECA). Indeed, after developing the Failure Mode Effects and Criticality Analysis, the results obtained for the plant under investigation are elaborated through Machine Learning techniques such as the Association Rule Mining to define the cause-effect relationships that led to a failure. The association rules extracted are then processed through the Social Network Analysis to represent such relationships, facilitate their comprehension, and identify the existence of communities of nodes to detect critical patterns and locate the most influential nodes. The knowledge of such details can provide helpful support in terms of awareness of the plant and the development of intelligent maintenance procedures. The proposed approach is applied to an off-shore and on-shore platform to assess the impact of the theoretical analysis on the practical implementation by highlighting unknown relations among the analyzed variables and showing new cause-effect relationships.","Machine Learning,Failure Mode Effects and Criticality Analysis,Risk-Based Maintenance,Association Rule Mining,Data-driven approach,Social Network Analysis,"
"modulation recognition in maritime multipath channels: a blind equalization-aided deep learning approach","2020","Modulation recognition has been long investigated in the literature, however, the performance could be severely degraded in multipath fading channels especially for high-order Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) signals. This could be a critical problem in the broadband maritime wireless communications, where various propagation paths with large differences in the time of arrival are very likely to exist. Specifically, multiple paths may stem from the direct path, the reflection paths from the rough sea surface, and the refraction paths from the atmospheric duct, respectively. To address this issue, we propose a novel blind equalization-aided deep learning (DL) approach to recognize QAM signals in the presence of multipath propagation. The proposed approach consists of two modules: A blind equalization module and a subsequent DL network which employs the structure of ResNet. With predefined searching step-sizes for the blind equalization algorithm, which are designed according to the set of modulation formats of interest, the DL network is trained and tested over various multipath channel parameter settings. It is shown that as compared to the conventional DL approaches without equalization, the proposed method can achieve an improvement in the recognition accuracy up to 30% in severe multipath scenarios, especially in the high SNR regime. Moreover, it efficiently reduces the number of training data that is required.","novel blind equalization-aided deep learning approach,direct path,refraction paths,Blind equalizers,blind equalization,telecommunication computing,QAM signals,Machine learning,blind equalization algorithm,Feature extraction,Quadrature amplitude modulation,blind equalisers,maritime multipath channels,propagation paths,modulation recognition,time of arrival,deep learning,rough sea surface,quadrature amplitude modulation,multipath propagation,Multipath channels,high-order Quadrature Amplitude Modulation signals,multipath channels,recognition accuracy,multipath fading channels,severe multipath scenarios,blind equalization module,reflection paths,Modulation recognition,multipath channel parameter settings,multiple paths,marine communication,conventional DL approaches,broadband maritime,Task analysis,learning (artificial intelligence),fading channels,"
"fault diagnosis for induction generator-based wind turbine using ensemble deep learning techniques","2022","Fault diagnosis in induction machines (IM) require effective detection at early stages to prevent permanent machine failure. This requires fast sensing of disturbances as well as efficient diagnosis methods. Conventional signal measuring techniques are usually intrusive, sensitive, with a low signal-to-noise ratio, and may show limited performance at incipient fault stages. Moreover, traditional machine learning (ML) diagnosis techniques based on handcrafted feature extraction methods suffer from limitations that can be overcome by deep learning (DL) with automatic feature extraction capabilities. In this paper, an online, non-intrusive method is proposed for fault diagnosis in a three-phase IM based on infrared imaging. The proposed method integrates three convolutional neural network (CNN)-based DL models (Inception, Xception, and MobileNet) to identify IM health status, fault types, and stator Inter-turn faults (ITF) location and severity. Deep features obtained from these CNNs are merged through Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) resulting in spatial-time-frequency features. This fusion reduces the input features’ size and improves diagnostic accuracy. Merged features’ length is further reduced using the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) where these reduced features are then used for classification. Compared to DL-based diagnosis methods introduced in previous work, the proposed method shows superior performance. First, it uses the IR images directly without the need for clustering and segmentation steps, thus saving time and effort. Moreover, ensembled DL is applied via combining the three CNNs benefits altogether rather than applying an individual DL method. Finally, unlike the huge features’ number exhibited by previous studies, the proposed approach uses minimal features, thus reducing classification complexity and time while maintaining 100% classification accuracy.","Renewable energy generating,Wind energy​ sources,Ensemble deep learning,Classification,Infrared thermal imaging,Fault diagnosis,Wind turbine inter-turn faults,Condition monitoring,"

"infrared small target detection using reinforced mser-induced saliency measure","2023","This paper presents a robust scheme to extract weak small target under intricate backgrounds. Firstly, the maximally stable extremal regions (MSER) algorithm is employed to seek extremal regions whose size and shape are consistent with the definition of small target and whose gray level is relatively stable. Then, in view of the fact that small targets are relatively sparse defect areas in the whole image, the MSER-induced global saliency measure (MGSM) is developed to reduce regular backgrounds and enhance target signal. Meanwhile, based on the characteristics of small targets with compact gray levels and a certain contrast with its surrounding background, the MSER-induced local saliency measure (MLSM) is designed to reliably enlarge the target signal and remove strong clutter interferences. Finally, the reinforced MSER-induced saliency measure (RMSM) defined by fusing MGSM and MLSM can successfully eliminate complex backgrounds and highlight real targets. Results demonstrate that this method has superiority in enhancing dim target against various backgrounds and has strong robustness to different target shapes and sizes.","Global and local saliency measurements,Infrared imaging,Small target detection,maximally stable extremal regions (MSER),"
"development of an interpretable maritime accident prediction system using machine learning techniques","2022","Every year, maritime accidents cause severe damages not only to humans but also to maritime instruments like vessels. The authors of this work therefore propose a machine learning-based maritime accident prediction system that can be used to prevent maritime accidents from happening by predicting and interpreting the accidents. This work overcomes the limitations of the existing works that lack practicability in the sense that the ex-post analyses are conducted to suggest accident prevention strategies but maritime accidents are not analyzed holistically. Using extensive literature reviews and expert interviews, a large number of risk factors associated with maritime accidents are identified, and related data are collected and utilized in the work. Throughout variable selection, data retrieval, hot-spot identification, and the maritime accident prediction model construction process, various machine learning algorithms are exploited in order to construct an organized system. In addition, interpretations for the resulting accident predictions are given using interpretable machine learning algorithms so as to provide explainable results to users. Finally, the proposed system is evaluated using a SERVQUAL model and proves its effectiveness in real-world applications.","Human factors,Predictive models,Risk management,Safety,accident prediction,Bayes methods,ocean engineering,Accidents,Machine learning,interpretable machine learning,Maritime accident,"
"a sensitivity quantification approach to significance analysis of thrusters in dynamic positioning operations","2021","The safety of offshore operations is highly dependent on the dynamic positioning (DP) capability of a vessel. Meanwhile, DP capability comes down to the ability of the thrust generated by thrusters to counteract environmental forces. Therefore, it is significant to investigate which thrusters are important to the position-keeping ability of vessels. However, complex environmental factors make the investigation of thrusters' importance more complicated. Hence, this paper proposes a new method to identify the influence of each thruster on vessel's station-keeping capability in different sea states. The station-keeping capability is quantified by a defined synthesized positioning ability criterion comprised by vessel position, heading angle, and consumed power. Through the comparison of different machine learning approaches, support vector machine (SVM) is used for building a surrogate model between DP capability and thrusters. In order to determine the most sensitive thruster in the whole process of vessel operation, an improved sensitivity analysis (SA) called ‘PAWN’ is employed along with statistical analysis to evaluate the significance of thrusters from different perspectives. Seventeen cases are investigated with respect to different thruster failures in various sea states. The results show the proposed method is able to identify the significance of each thruster in different scenarios.","Statistical analysis,Sensitivity analysis,Dynamic positioning capability,Thruster failures,"

A vast majority of research focuses on anomalous vessel behaviour detection from Automated Identification System (AIS) data, using artificial intelligence (AI), Bayesian networks and machine learning based methods. AIS is a cooperative system that employs VHF transceivers to share vessel information through terrestrial and satellite communication networks. To track small boats not fitted with AIS, uncooperative surveillance systems are employed. These systems have been studied in a relatively small number of publications. In vessel behaviour pattern recognition, target classification is critically important, particularly, in asymmetric warfare situations. The paper concludes with a discussion of future outlook in vessel behaviour pattern recognition research.","Vessel behaviour recognition,Target tracking,Pattern of life,Anomaly detection,Plan recognition,Bayesian networks,Target classification,"
"deeptracks: geopositioning maritime vehicles in video acquired from a moving platform","2021","Geopositioning and tracking a moving boat at sea is a very challenging problem, requiring boat detection, matching and estimating its GPS location from imagery with no common features. The problem can be stated as follows: given imagery from a camera mounted on a moving platform with known GPS location as the only valid sensor, we predict the geoposition of a target boat visible in images. Our solution uses recent ML algorithms, the camera-scene geometry and Bayesian filtering. The proposed pipeline first detects and tracks the target boatâ€™s location in the image with the strategy of tracking by detection. This image location is then converted to geoposition to the local sea coordinates referenced to the camera GPS location using plane projective geometry. Finally, target boat local coordinates are transformed to global GPS coordinates to estimate the geoposition. To achieve a smooth geotrajectory, we apply unscented Kalman filter (UKF) which implicitly overcomes small detection errors in the early stages of the pipeline. We tested the performance of our approach using GPS ground truth and show the accuracy and speed of the estimated geopositions. The source code will be made public once the paper is accepted.","Pipelines,DeepTracks,Kalman filters,Object Tracking by Detection,geoposition,Prediction algorithms,global GPS,Bayes methods,Cameras,Bayesian filtering,camera GPS location,pipeline,maritime vehicle geopositioning,Global Positioning System,image location,Unscented Kalman Filter,UKF,Filtering,camera-scene geometry,boats,unscented Kalman filter,Target tracking,cameras,object detection,video signal processing,moving platform,boat detection,marine engineering computing,GPS ground truth,plane projective geometry,local sea coordinates,Plane Projective Geometry,Boats,Geopositioning,GPS location,moving boat,ML algorithms,Deep Learning,target boat local coordinates,"
"engine vibration anomaly detection in vessel engine room","2022","Unsupervised and autonomous operations require new, more efficient, and smarter technical solutions. Digitalization is one of the enablers of autonomous operation, with installing new sensors and using the data for AI and machine learning. The trend is to move the handling the vast amount of data from sensors, installed in machines, and devices, close to the sensors. This way, data communication can be heavily reduced, while the latency of decisions based on data can be minimal. This is achieved by moving the advanced data analysis capabilities from the cloud to the edge. In this paper, the driver of technological development is the concept of an unmanned machine room, where the normal inspections performed by personnel are automated using sensors and algorithms.We present an analysis of vibration data, recorded at a cruise ferry\x92s engines, using a signal processing method called cepstrums. A cepstrum is a version of frequency analysis, intending to identify and visualize periodic structures in data using cepstrograms. Compared to spectrogram analysis, usage of cepstrogram enables better visualization of engine behavior into the shape of audio signals.

"ship trajectory prediction based on machine learning and deep learning: a systematic review and methods analysis","2023","Ship trajectory prediction based on Automatic Identification System (AIS) data has attracted increasing interest as it helps prevent collision accidents and eliminate potential navigational conflicts. Therefore, it is necessary and urgent to conduct a systematic analysis of all the prediction methods to help reveal their advantages to ensure safety at sea in different scenarios. It is particularly important and significant within the context of unmanned ships forming a new hybrid maritime traffic together with manned ships in the future. This paper aims to conduct a comparative analysis of the up-to-date ship trajectory prediction algorithms based on machine learning and deep learning methods. To do so, five classical machine learning methods (i.e., Kalman Filter, Gaussian Process Regression, Support Vector Regression, Random Forest, and Back Propagation Network) and eight deep learning methods (i.e., Recurrent Neural Networks, Long Short-Term Memory, Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory, Gate Recurrent Unit, Bi-directional Gate Recurrent Unit, Sequence to Sequence, Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network, and Transformer) are thoroughly analysed and compared from the algorithm essence and applications to excavate their features and adaptability for manned and unmanned ships. The findings reveal the characteristics of various prediction methods and provide valuable implications for different stakeholders to guide the best-fit choice of a particular method as the solution under a specific circumstance.

"event processing in supply chain management – the status quo and research outlook","2019","Increasing supply chain complexity poses new challenges to managers. On the other hand, evolving information and communication technology offers ample opportunity for more reliable supply chain management practices. Event processing has established itself in many applications in logistics. Although the topic has enjoyed increasing popularity, there is no study taking stock of prior developments and guiding future research. Therefore, a systematic literature review on the topic of event processing in supply chain management from 2005 until the present is undertaken. Extant literature is synthesized and analyzed from technological and supply chain management perspectives to inform scholars and practitioners of existing field developments. Additionally, to guide future scholarly endeavors, a research agenda is derived from promising topics raised in papers and unfulfilled practical requirements. We find that current solutions primarily focus on a limited number of supply chain core processes and a restricted number of supply chain actors. The majority of publications focused on time-temperature sensitive products. Additionally, the domination of road transportation can be observed, while other modes of transport are often ignored in solution implementations. Decision support in terms of object traceability within the supply chain is found in most articles. RFID, typically accompanied by the Electronic Product Code Information Services standard, is the dominant enabling technology. Future research should focus on the topics of standardization, granularity, data sources, and cooperation. Moreover, holistic event processing supported by big data and machine learning techniques could create interfaces with other legacy business intelligence applications.

"on iot intrusion detection based on data augmentation for enhancing learning on unbalanced samples","2022","Internet of things (IoT) security is a prerequisite for the rapid development of the IoT to enhance human well-being. Machine learning-based intrusion detection systems (IDS) have good protection capabilities. However, it is difficult to identify attack information in massive amounts of data, which leads to inefficient model detection when faced with insufficient samples for certain types of attacks. In this regard, this paper fuses deep learning methods and statistical ideas to address the problem of minority samples attack detection, and proposes an intrusion detection method for the IoT based on Improved Conditional Variational Autoencoder (ICVAE) and Borderline Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (BSM), called ICVAE-BSM. By introducing an auxiliary network into the Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) to adjust the output probability distribution of the encoder, learning the posterior distribution of different classes of samples, so that the distributions of samples of the same class are concentrated, and the distributions of different classes of samples are scattered in the latent space; then based on BSM, adaptively synthesize the edge latent variables in the latent space of ICVAE, and feed the new synthetic edge latent variables to the ICVAE’s decoder to generate representative new samples to balance the data set. The output of the encoder is connected to the Softmax classifier at last, and the original samples are mixed with the generated samples to fine-tune it to enhance its generalization ability for intrusion detection of minority samples. We use the NSL-KDD data set, CIC-IDS2017 data set and CSE-CIC-IDS2018 data set to simulate and evaluate the model, the experimental results show that the proposed method can more effectively improve the accuracy of IoT attack detection under the condition of unbalanced samples.","Data augmentation,Borderline-SMOTE,Conditional Variational Autoencoder,IoT intrusion detection,"

"securing iot based maritime transportation system through entropy-based dual-stack machine learning framework","2023","Internet of Things (IoTs) is envisaged to widely capture the realm of logistics and transportation services in future. The applications of ubiquitous IoTs have been extended to Maritime Transportation Systems (MTS) that spawned increasing security threats; posing serious fiscal concerns to stakeholders involved. Among these threats, Distributed Denial of Service Attack (DDoS) is ranked very high that can wreak havoc on IoT artifacts of the MTS networks. Timely and effective detection of such attacks is imperative for necessary mitigation. Conventional approaches exploit entropy of attributes in network traffic for detecting DDoS attacks. However, the majority of these approaches are static in nature and consider only a few network traffic parameters, limiting the number of DDoS attack detection to a few types and intensities. In current research, a novel framework named â€œDual Stack Machine Learning (S2ML)â€ has been proposed to calculate distinct entropy-based varying 10-Tuple (T) features from network traffic features, three window sizes and associated Rate of Exponent Separation (RES). These features have been exploited for developing an intelligent model over MTS-IoT datasets to successfully detect multiple types of DDoS attacks in MTS. S2ML is an efficient framework that overcomes the shortcomings of prevalent DDoS detection approaches, as evident from the comparison with Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), Alternating Decision Tree (ADT) and Simple Logistic Regression (SLR) over different evaluation metrics (Confusion metrics, ROCs).

"multi-label classification for ais data anomaly detection using wavelet transform","2022","Thanks to the Automatic Identification System (AIS), ships and other maritime equipment are able to communicate with each other, for example, by sending information about their position. This solution allows for early collision detection when two or more ships are on a collision course. In the newer version of AIS, a satellite infrastructure is used to extend the communication range. Unfortunately, satellite AIS deals with so-called packet collision effect: since there is a problem with synchronizing AIS data coming from multiple terrestrial areas, a single satellite may receive several AIS messages at the same time and be unable to correctly process them, causing the data to get lost or garbled. In this article, a machine learning based framework for detecting the incorrect AIS data is presented. In this approach, after the first stage (clustering), a dedicated anomaly detection algorithm searches for damaged AIS messages and conducts multi-label classification (with Random Forest and wavelet transform) to decide which fields of such message requires further correction.

"applications of shapelet transform to time series classification of earthquake, wind and wave data","2021","Autonomous detection of desired events from large databases using time series classification is becoming increasingly important in civil engineering as a result of continued long-term health monitoring of a large number of engineering structures encompassing buildings, bridges, towers, and offshore platforms. In this context, this paper proposes the application of a relatively new time series representation named “Shapelet transform”, which is based on local similarity in the shape of the time series subsequences. In consideration of the individual attributes distinctive to time series signals in earthquake, wind and ocean engineering, the application of this transform yields a new shape-based feature representation. Combining this shape-based representation with a standard machine learning algorithm, a truly “white-box” machine learning model is proposed with understandable features and a transparent algorithm. This model automates event detection without the intervention of domain practitioners, yielding a practical event detection procedure. The efficacy of this proposed shapelet transform-based autonomous detection procedure is demonstrated by examples, to identify known and unknown earthquake events from continuously recorded ground-motion measurements, to detect pulses in the velocity time history of ground motions to distinguish between near-field and far-field ground motions, to identify thunderstorms from continuous wind speed measurements, to detect large-amplitude wind-induced vibrations from the bridge monitoring data, and to identify plunging breaking waves that have a significant impact on offshore structures.","Time series shapelets,Shapelet transform,Thunderstorm classification,Earthquake detection,Time series classification,Machine learning,Breaking wave detection,"

These processes are monitored with a plethora of sensors, continuously gathering vast amount of valuable data from various locations with many control loops distributed in the processes with a dedicated overall process control using different strategies, which recently have AI and machine learning techniques in their portfolio. The data from the sensors are valuable in data fusion not only for deterministic mechanistic modeling but also for exploratory data analysis (EDA), a growing branch of AI-based industrial machine learning. Data from process tomography/tomometry using nonintrusive and noninvasive sensing provide big data in real time, useful in identifying various flow phenomena, such as flow regimes, tunneling flow in silos, infiltration of sand in pipes, unusually high presence of gas bubbles in cooling water, etc. In this chapter, some applications of ECT and EIT in the above three process industries are presented. This chapter focuses on the sensor arrays and protocols used along with excitation and sensing methods used in the ECT/EIT modules and then presents some results from EDA as applied in the growing field of industrial machine learning. In all the three branches of process industries mentioned above, interesting results are presented showing possibilities of flow regime identification based on the distribution of the phases involved with the possibilities of integrating ECT/EIT in model free adaptive control of these processes.","Fluidized bed column (FBC),Neural networks,Multiphase flow,Process safety,Sensor data fusion,Process industries,Electrical capacitance/impedance tomography (ECT/EIT),Process tomography,Flow regime,Model free adaptive control (MFAC),Pressurized water reactors,Machine learning,"
"a document-based data model for large scale computational maritime situational awareness","2015","Computational Maritime Situational Awareness (MSA) supports the maritime industry, governments, and international organizations with machine learning and big data techniques for analyzing vessel traffic data available through the Automatic Identification System (AIS). A critical challenge of scaling computational MSA to big data regimes is integrating the core learning algorithms with big data storage modes and data models. To address this challenge, we report results from our experimentation with MongoDB, a NoSQL document-based database which we test as a supporting platform for computational MSA. We experiment with a document model that avoids database joins when linking position and voyage AIS vessel information and allows tuning the database index and document sizes in response to the AIS data rate. We report results for the AIS data ingested and analyzed daily at the NATO Centre for Maritime Research and Experimentation (CMRE).","database index,big data techniques,database indexing,Marine vehicles,NoSQL document-based database,Organizations,database joins,document-based data model,NoSQL,vessel traffic data analysis,data analysis,automatic identification system,marine engineering,Databases,AIS,machine learning,Data models,Big data,computational maritime situational awareness,MongoDB,Big Data,document handling,Trajectory,NATO Centre for Maritime Research and Experimentation,MongoDB database,Sensors,learning (artificial intelligence),computational MSA,data models,"
