"fast and parameter-light rare behavior detection in maritime trajectories","2020","Rare behaviors indicate important events and situations in maritime surveillance applications. State-of-the-art methods provide many effective solutions to detect anomalous behaviors. Meanwhile, most solutions are parameter-laden and too costly to identify useful rare behaviors with human knowledge in a visual analytics manner. This paper is concerned with a scheme cross trajectories, vessel attributes and the movement context for detecting rare behaviors through preprocessing, kNN-based clustering, and verification. Although the scheme involves several parameters, we demonstrate that they are able to be tackled in thresholds. As a result, a rare behavior factor is the single parameter that affect the detecting results. The proposed scheme is evaluated via a simulated data set for performance and a real life AIS data for effectiveness. Results show that high accuracy to labelled anomalies and useful rare behaviors can be achieved.","Rare behaviour detection,Trajectory,Visual analytics,"
"a novelty detection approach to diagnosing hull and propeller fouling","2019","Hull and propeller performance have a primary role in overall vessel efficiency. Vessel fouling is a common phenomenon where undesirable substances attach or grow on the ship hull. A clear understanding of the extent of the degradation of the hull will allow better management of assets and prediction of the best time for dry docking and hull maintenance work. In this paper, the authors investigate the problems of predicting the hull condition in real operations based on data measured by the on-board systems. The proposed solution uses an unsupervised Machine Learning (ML) modelling technique to eliminate the need for collecting labeled data related to the hull and propeller fouling condition. Two anomaly detection methods based on Support Vector Machines and k-nearest neighbour have been applied to predict the hull condition using the available parameters measured on-board. Data from the Research Vessel The Princess Royal has been exploited to show the effectiveness of the proposed methods and to benchmark them in a realistic maritime application.","Data analytics,Hull and propeller performance,Sensor data collection,Supervised learning,Hull fouling detection,Ship efficiency,"
"anomaly based sea-surface small target detection using k-nearest neighbor classification","2020","Sea-surface small target detection is always a difficult problem in high-resolution maritime ubiquitous radars for complex characteristics of sea clutter, weak target returns, and diversity of targets. Multiple features extracted from radar returns in different domains have ability but not enough to solely distinguish radar returns with target from sea clutter. Joint exploitation of multiple features becomes the key to improve detection performance. In this article, the K-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm and anomaly detection idea are cooperated to develop a novel sea-surface target detection method in the feature space spanned by the eight existing salient features. The detection is realized by the anomaly detection followed by a specially designed KNN-based classifier with a controllable false alarm rate. In the anomaly detection, a decision region is determined by the hyper-spherical coverage of the training set of sea clutter that is sufficient and ergodic in the feature space. The KNN-based classifier is designed based on the training sample set of sea clutter and the training sample set of simulated target returns plus sea clutter that is sufficient but nonergodic, by joint usage of feature weighting, neighbor weighting, and distance weighting. The novel method is validated by the two open and recognized IPIX and CSIR radar databases for sea-surface small target detection. The results show that it provides significant performance improvement in comparison with the existing multiple-feature-based detection methods, owing to the fact that the novel method avoids the dimension restriction and feature compression loss in the existing methods.","k-nearest neighbor algorithm,feature compression loss,IPIX radar databases,marine radar,high-resolution maritime ubiquitous radars,Anomaly detection,radar detection,radar clutter,KNN-based classifier design,anomaly based sea-surface,neighbor algorithm,Feature extraction,sea clutter,radar computing,anomaly detection idea,object detection,feature extraction,CSIR radar databases,weak target return simulation,K-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier with controllable false alarm rate,Radar clutter,feature weighting space,nearest neighbour methods,Training,sea-surface small target detection,Clutter,sea-surface target detection method,Object detection,Anomaly detection framework,multiple-feature-based detection methods,training sample set,Radar detection,"
"on the effectiveness of ai-assisted anomaly detection methods in maritime navigation","2020","The automatic identification system (AIS) has become an essential tool for maritime security. Nevertheless, how to effectively use the static and dynamic voyage information of the AIS data in maritime traffic situation awareness is still a challenge. This paper presents a comparative study of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques on their effectiveness in dealing with various anomalies in maritime domain using the AIS data. The AIS on-off switching (OOS) anomaly is critical in maritime security, since AIS technology is susceptible to manipulation and it can be switched on and off to hide illegal activities. Thus, we try to detect and distinguish between intentional and non-intentional AIS OOS anomalies through our AI -assisted anomaly detection framework. We use AIS data, in particular positional and navigational status of vessels, to study the effectiveness of seven AI techniques, such as artificial neural network, support vector machine, logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, decision tree, random forest and naive Bayes, in detecting the AIS OOS anomalies. Our experimental results show that ANN and SVM are the most suitable techniques in detecting the AIS OOS anomalies with 99.9% accuracy. Interestingly, the ANN model outperforms others when trained with a balanced (i.e., same order of samples per class) dataset, and SVM, on the other hand, is suitable when training dataset is unbalanced.","maritime traffic situation awareness,AI-assisted anomaly detection,decision trees,Support vector machines,logistic regression,Anomaly detection,static voyage information,random forests,ANN,marine navigation,Feature extraction,security of data,maritime security,k-nearest neighbors,regression analysis,AIS technology,naive Bayes,neural nets,naive Bayes methods,automatic identification system,marine safety,marine engineering,support vector machines,maritime navigation,dynamic voyage information,maritime domain,random forest,SVM,Artificial intelligence,AIS on-off switching anomaly,nearest neighbour methods,artificial neural network,Training,Trajectory,support vector machine,nonintentional AIS OOS anomalies,Navigation,artificial intelligence,decision tree,AIS data,"
"a comparative investigation of data-driven approaches based on one-class classifiers for condition monitoring of marine machinery system","2020","The safety and reliability of ship navigation depend heavily on the performance of the marine machinery system, which can be maintained at a high level by condition based maintenance. Intelligent condition monitoring is the key to achieve condition based maintenance. However, it is not easy to realize intelligent condition monitoring in a real ship, because there are not enough labeled fault samples to train an accurate detection model. In fact, the potential value of a large number of normal samples collected by the shipboard monitoring system has not been mined out. Since one-class classifiers only need one-class samples to train the detection models, they are very suitable for such occasions. In this paper, we investigate the performance of several representative one-class classifiers, such as OCSVM (One class support vector machine), SVDD (Support vector data description), GKNN (Global k-nearest neighbors), LOF (Local outlier factor), IForest (Isolation forest) and ABOD (Angle-based outlier detection), in condition monitoring of the marine machinery system. The dataset of a marine gas turbine propulsion system is used for a case study, which is a simulation dataset verified by the real ship data. Compared with previous literatures, our new work is to investigate the performance of a variety of key one-class classifiers, not only considering the common evaluation indexes for machine learning, but also considering the sample combinations of the training dataset, distribution of misclassified samples, and the tolerance to contaminated data. The experimental results show that these algorithms have good performance in the dataset in some common evaluation indexes. However, they show some obvious performance differences in some novel evaluation indexes we proposed. This can provide decision support for the application of one-class classifiers in the condition monitoring of many other marine machinery systems.","One-class classifier,Marine machinery,Condition based maintenance,Condition monitoring,"
"an automated treatment plan alert system to safeguard cancer treatments in radiation therapy","2022","In radiation oncology, the intricate process of delivering radiation to a patient is detailed by the patient’s treatment plan, which is data describing the geometry, construction and strength of the radiation machine and the radiation beam it emits. The patient’s life depends upon the accuracy of the treatment plan, which is left in the hands of the vendor-specific software automatically generating the plan after an initial patient consultation and planning with a medical professional. However, corrupted and erroneous treatment plan data have previously resulted in severe patient harm when errors go undetected and radiation proceeds. The aim of this paper is to develop an automatic error-checking system to prevent the accidental delivery of radiation treatment to an area of the human body (i.e., the treatment site) that differs from the plan’s documented intended site. To this end, we develop a method for structuring treatment plan data in order to feed machine-learning (ML) classifiers and predict a plan’s treatment site. In practice, a warning may be raised if the prediction disagrees with the documented intended site. The contribution of this paper is in the strategic structuring of the complex, intricate, and nonuniform data of modern treatment planning and from multiple vendors in order to easily train ML algorithms. A three-step process utilizing up- and down-sampling and dimension reduction, the method we develop in this paper reduces the thousands of parameters comprising a single treatment plan to a single two-dimensional heat map that is independent of the specific vendor or construction of the machine used for treatment. Our heat-map structure lends itself well to feed well-established ML algorithms, and we train–test random forest, softmax, k-nearest neighbors, shallow neural network, and support vector machine using real clinical treatment plans from several hospitals in the United States. The paper demonstrates that the proposed method characterizes treatment sites so well that ML classifiers may predict head-neck, breast, and prostate treatment sites with an accuracy of about 94%. The proposed method is the first step towards a thorough, fully automated error-checking system in radiation therapy.","Radiation heat map,Nonuniform treatment data,Cancer classification,"
"ship target classification based on hu invariant moments and art for maritime video surveillance","2017","In the intelligent video surveillance system used at sea, the target classification is the basis of the video content analysis and the target's behavior identification. Thus, this research work is about to classify the ship targets at sea by using shape features. This paper extracted the regional shape eigenvalues of ship targets by Hu invariant moments and ART coefficients, selected 7 regional shape eigenvalues of highest distinction from the 43 regional shape eigenvalues extracted to constitute ship shape feature vector. On this part, this paper establishes the shape feature library for different types of ships (such as bulk carrier, container ship, tanker, etc.), proposing a classification method for the ship targets based on KNN template by matching and conducting the verification. It is proved that the 7 ship regional shapes eigenvalues can effectively distinguish different types of ship targets. Besides, the ship classification's accuracy rate of the method proposed by this paper is very high.","tankers,eigenvalues and eigenfunctions,Ship target classification,Hu invariant moments,ship target classification,container ship,Marine vehicles,Feature extraction,ship shape feature vector,Shape feature,intelligent video surveillance system,regional shape eigenvalues,KNN template,image matching,Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions,ships,ART coefficients,marine engineering,video content analysis,object detection,Shape,feature extraction,image classification,Template matching,shape feature library,Video surveillance,bulk carrier,Subspace constraints,ART,Object detection,ART neural nets,video surveillance,maritime video surveillance,"
"seaâ€“land segmentation in maritime surveillance radars via k-nearest neighbor classifier","2020","Shipborne or airborne maritime surveillance radars at scan mode work at a complex scene consisting of land, sea, and islands. Sea-land segmentation provides a two-class classification of sea clutter versus ground clutter to the surveillance scene as a precondition of adaptive target detection. It is a difficult problem because only a few coherent pulses are available at scan mode. Moreover, due to moving radar platforms and wide dynamic range of ground and sea clutter in power, average amplitude, Doppler offset, and initial phase of radar, the returns vector fails to distinguish sea clutter and ground clutter. In this article, a similarity measure of two radar returns vectors, which is invariant to amplitude, Doppler offset, and initial phase, is constructed, which is closely relevant to the Doppler bandwidth of a returns vector. Based on the similarity measure, a K-nearest neighbor classifier is proposed to yield a pixel-level sea-land segmentation of the scene. Further, the morphological filtering is operated on the pixel-level segmentation to obtain a region-level segmentation. Moreover, the discrete FrÃ©chet distances of the main boundaries in successive scan periods are used to assess segmentation quality. The proposed method is verified by measured data from an airborne radar and an island-based radar. The results show that it behaves better than the methods using thresholding phase linearity degree of radar returns and the support vector machine, and back propagation neural network in a three-dimensional feature space.","airborne radar,K-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier,region-level segmentation,K-nearest neighbor classifier,radar platforms,seaâ€“land segmentation,marine radar,island-based radar,K,Radar antennas,radar detection,complex scene,radar clutter,pixel-level sea-land segmentation,returns vector,ground clutter,pixel-level segmentation,scan mode work,sea clutter,geophysical image processing,support vector machines,similarity measure,object detection,feature extraction,search radar,radar imaging,Doppler effect,Radar clutter,Doppler,Doppler bandwidth,Doppler radar,Clutter,Discrete FrÃ©chet distance,surveillance scene,airborne maritime surveillance radars,radar returns vectors,morphological filter,Surveillance,image segmentation,remote sensing by radar,segmentation quality,oceanographic techniques,"
"heterogeneous swarms for maritime dynamic target search and tracking","2020","Current strategies employed for maritime target search and tracking are primarily based on the use of agents following a predetermined path to perform a systematic sweep of a search area. Recently, dynamic Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithms have been used together with swarming multi-robot systems (MRS), giving search and tracking solutions the added properties of robustness, scalability, and flexibility. Swarming MRS also give the end-user the opportunity to incrementally upgrade the robotic system, inevitably leading to the use of heterogeneous swarming MRS. However, such systems have not been well studied and incorporating upgraded agents into a swarm may result in degraded mission performances. In this paper, we propose a PSO-based strategy using a topological k-nearest neighbor graph with tunable exploration and exploitation dynamics with an adaptive repulsion parameter. This strategy is implemented within a simulated swarm of 50 agents with varying proportions of fast agents tracking a target represented by a fictitious binary function. Through these simulations, we are able to demonstrate an increase in the swarm's collective response level and target tracking performance by substituting in a proportion of fast buoys.","fast agents,predetermined path,topological k-nearest neighbor graph,heterogeneous swarms,maritime dynamic target search,tracking solutions,Multi-Robot Search,multi-robot systems,multirobot systems,particle swarm optimisation,target tracking,tunable exploration,upgraded agents,maritime target search,Target tracking,Dynamic Target Search,heterogeneous swarming MRS,Particle swarm optimization,Scalability,Robots,exploitation dynamics,degraded mission performances,systematic sweep,Heterogeneous Swarm,graph theory,Robustness,dynamic particle swarm optimization algorithms,end-user,robotic system,mobile robots,simulated swarm,adaptive repulsion parameter,PSO-based strategy,marine vehicles,Swarm Intelligence,Heuristic algorithms,Systematics,"
"indoor positioning system based on ble location fingerprinting with classification approach","2018","Position estimation is an important technique for location-based services. Many services and applications, such as navigation assistance, surveillance of patients and social networking, have been developed based on users’ position. Although the GPS plays an important role in positioning systems, its signal strength is extremely weak inside buildings. Thus, other sensing devices are necessary to improve the accuracy of indoor localisation. In the past decade, researchers have developed a series of indoor positioning technologies based on the received signal strength (RSS) of WiFi, ZigBee or Bluetooth devices under the infrastructure of wireless sensor network for location estimation. We can compute the distance of the devices by measuring their RSS, but the correctness of the result is unsatisfactory because the radio signal interference is a considerable issue and the indoor radio propagation is too complicated to model. Using the location fingerprint to estimate a target position is a feasible strategy because the location fingerprint records the characteristics of the signals and the signal strength is related to the space relation. This type of algorithm estimates the location of a target by matching online measurements with the closest a-priori location fingerprints. The matching or classification algorithm is a key issue in the correctness of location fingerprinting. In this paper, we propose an effective location fingerprinting algorithm based on the general and weighted k-nearest neighbour algorithms to estimate the position of the target node. The grid points are trained with an interval of 2 m, and the estimated position error is about 1.8 m. Thus, the proposed method is low computation consumption, and with an acceptable accuracy.","Bluetooth low energy,Weighted k-nearest neighbor,k-nearest neighbor,Location fingerprinting,"
"person re-identification by multiple instance metric learning with impostor rejection","2017","Due to its ability to eliminate the visual ambiguities in single-shot algorithms, video-based person re-identification has received an increasing focus in computer vision. Visual ambiguities caused by variations in view angle, lighting, and occlusions make the re-identification problem extremely challenging. To overcome the ambiguities, most previous approaches often extract robust feature representations or learn a sophisticated feature transformation. However, most of these approaches ignore the effect of the impostors arising from annotation or tracking process. In this case, impostors are regarded as genuine and applied in training process, leading to the model drift problem. In order to reduce the risk of model drifting, we propose to automatically discover impostors in a multiple instance metric learning framework. Specifically, we propose a kNN based confidence score to evaluate how much an impostor invades the interested target and utilize it as a prior in the framework. In the meanwhile, we integrate an impostor rejection mechanism in the multiple instance metric learning framework to automatically discover impostors, and learn the semantical similarity metrics with the refined training set. Experiments show that the proposed system performs favorably against the state-of-the-art algorithms on two challenging datasets (iLIDS-VID and PRID 2011). We have improved the rank 1 recognition rate on iLIDS-VID and PRID 2011 dataset by 1.0% and 1.2%, respectively.","Impostor rejection,Multiple instance metric learning,Person re-identification,Graphical model,"
"chapter 4 - anomaly detection","2014","This chapter presents an extension of conformal prediction for anomaly detection applications. It includes the presentation and discussion of the Conformal Anomaly Detector (CAD) and the computationally more efficient Inductive Conformal Anomaly Detector (ICAD), which are general algorithms for unsupervised or semi-supervised and offline or online anomaly detection. One of the key properties of CAD and ICAD is that the rate of detected anomalies is well calibrated in the online setting under the randomness assumption. Similar to conformal prediction, the choice of Nonconformity Measure (NCM) is of central importance for the classification performance of CAD and ICAD. A novel NCM for examples that are represented as sets of points is presented. One of the key properties of this NCM, which is known as the directed Hausdorff k-nearest neighbors (DH-kNN) NCM, is that the p-value for an incomplete test example monotonically decreases as more data points are observed. An instance of CAD based on DH-kNN NCM, known as the sequential Hausdorff nearest neighbor conformal anomaly detector (SHNN-CAD), is presented and discussed for sequential anomaly detection applications. We also investigate classification performance results for the unsupervised online SHNN-CAD on a public dataset of labeled trajectories.","k-Nearest Neighbor,Unsupervised Learning,Inductive Conformal Predictors,One-Class Classification,Sequential Data,Semi-supervised Learning,Anomaly Detection,Hausdorff Distance,"
