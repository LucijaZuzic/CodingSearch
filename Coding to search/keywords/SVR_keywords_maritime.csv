"coastal water bathymetry for critical zone management using regression tree models from gaofen-6 imagery","2021","Coastal water depth information is fundamental to coast management and coastal critical zone development. The traditional bathymetric sounding method depends on radar or surveying vessels, which are expensive and time-consuming. Thus, it is of high importance to develop a rapidly updating water depth detection method. In order to bridge this gap, we explored the Chinese Gaofen-6 wide field of view (GF-6 WFV) visible-near infrared satellite imagery for large-scale accurate coastal bathymetric mapping and to understand the vertical water column environment with regression tree models. The predictors, including the Blue band/Violet band (BV), Green band/Violet band (GV), Yellow band/Violet band (YV), Green band (G), Yellow band (Y), and red-edge1 band (Re1), were derived via statistical analysis, as well as spectroscopy knowledge and experience. Compared with the conventional bathymetric method, such as single band algorithm (SBA), band ratio algorithm and support vector regression (SVR), the two regression trees used in this study yielded better accuracy. The R2, MAE and RMSE of the classification and regression tree (CART), the Cubist tree model were 0.74, 3.78 m and 5.35 m vs 0.78, 3.56 m and 4.88 m. Besides the improved accuracies, these tree-based models can effectively reveal water depth-associated environment types with the hierarchical relationships present in the visible spectral characteristics, which supports spatial zoning strategies for coastal critical zone management based on the Gaofen-6 imagery.","Bathymetry,Violet-related spectral ratio,Regression trees,SVR,Gaofen-6 satellite,Critical coastal zone management,"
"trajectory clustering for svr-based time of arrival estimation","2022","Accurate vessel Time of Arrival (ToA) estimation is important for port operation and resource management. In this paper, we propose a data-driven approach for estimating the ToA of ships based on Automatic Identification System (AIS) data. The proposed approach exploits a novel trajectory clustering approach to extract representative routes, from which training trajectories are grouped into clusters and ToA estimation models based on Support Vector Regressor (SVR) are trained for each cluster. The proposed ToA estimation approach adopts a short period of the latest AIS data as input and performs SVR model selection and ToA estimation in real-time. A historical AIS dataset provided by the Danish Maritime Authority is used to evaluate the proposed approach. Numerical results for tanker ships travelling to the port of Skagen demonstrate that the proposed approach can achieve ToA estimations that are 40% to 70% more accurate than state-of-the-art ToA estimation methods.","AIS data,Support Vector Regression (SVR),Time of Arrival estimation,"
"ais data-driven ship trajectory prediction modelling and analysis based on machine learning and deep learning methods","2023","Maritime transport faces new safety challenges in an increasingly complex traffic environment caused by large-scale and high-speed ships, particularly with the introduction of intelligent and autonomous ships. It is evident that Automatic Identification System (AIS) data-driven ship trajectory prediction can effectively aid in identifying abnormal ship behaviours and reducing maritime risks such as collision, stranding, and contact. Furthermore, trajectory prediction is widely recognised as one of the critical technologies for realising safe autonomous navigation. The prediction methods and their performance are the key factors for future safe and automatic shipping. Currently, ship trajectory prediction lacks the real performance measurement and analysis of different algorithms, including classical machine learning and emerging deep learning methods. This paper aims to systematically analyse the performance of ship trajectory prediction methods and pioneer experimental tests to reveal their advantages and disadvantages as well as fitness in different scenarios involving complicated systems. To do so, five machine learning methods (i.e., Kalman Filter (KF), Support Vector Progression (SVR), Back Propagation network (BP), Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), and Random Forest (RF)) and seven deep learning methods (i.e., Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gate Recurrent Unit (GRU), Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM), Sequence to Sequence (Seq2seq), Bi-directional Gate Recurrent Unit (Bi-GRU), and Transformer) are first extracted from the state-of-the-art literature review and then employed to implement the trajectory prediction and compare their prediction performance in the real world. Three AIS datasets are collected from the waters of representative traffic features, including a normal channel (i.e., the Chengshan Jiao Promontory), complex traffic (i.e., the Zhoushan Archipelago), and a port area (i.e., Caofeidian port). They are selected to test and analyse the performance of all twelve methods based on six evaluation indexes and explore the characteristics and effectiveness of the twelve trajectory prediction methods in detail. The experimental results provide a novel perspective, comparison, and benchmark for ship trajectory prediction research, which not only demonstrates the fitness of each method in different maritime traffic scenarios, but also makes significant contributions to maritime safety and autonomous shipping development.","Deep learning,Maritime safety,Trajectory prediction,AIS data,Machine learning,"
"exploring the impact of immersion on situational awareness and trust in remotely monitored maritime autonomous surface ships","2023","Consistent with the International Maritime Organisationâ€™s roadmap for regulating the operation of autonomous surface ships, most concepts of operations for crewed and uncrewed autonomous shipping rely on monitoring and operation from a Remote Control Centre (RCC). The successful execution of such activities requires that operators have adequate Situational Awareness (SA), while avoiding situations of information overload, and the right amount of, or calibrated, Trust in the system. In this study, we examined how operator SA and Trust were affected by different levels of Immersion of the Human-Machine Interface (HMI). Simulated RCC interfaces were constructed for a scenario where an autonomous container ship traversed the arctic escorted by robotic aids. SA, Trust, and Motion Sickness (MS) were tracked over time. Different Virtual Reality (VR) technologies were used to represent three levels of Immersion: Non-Immersive VR (NVR), Semi-Immersive VR (SVR), and Immersive VR (IVR). The results illustrated various trade-offs â€“ with NVR shown to be less taxing, SVR showing several potential benefits for SA, and IVR showing a strong relationship between Trust and SA accuracy, but increased MS. These results suggest that Immersion is an important factor in Situational Awareness and Trust in automation; future research should consider both the extent of Immersion, potential for MS, and the format of delivery (e.g. head-mounted displays versus immersive projection displays). Understanding these trade-offs between levels of Immersion is a requisite step for designing RCCs.","Trust,simulated RCC interfaces,Virtual reality,Remote Control Centre,Virtual Reality (VR),virtual reality,Marine vehicles,helmet mounted displays,Monitoring,Immersive VR,Different Virtual Reality technologies,adequate Situational Awareness,MS,International Maritime Organisation's roadmap,ships,immersive projection displays,marine safety,autonomous shipping,marine engineering,Motion Sickness (MS),autonomous container ship,Sea surface,Situational Awareness (SA),Tracking,Remote Control Centre (RCC),Maritime Autonomous Surface Ship (MASS),remotely monitored Maritime autonomous surface ships,Ice Navigation,Navigation,Motion sickness,Human-Machine Interface,"
"an adaptive hyper parameter tuning model for ship fuel consumption prediction under complex maritime environments","2022","An accurate prediction of ship fuel consumption is critical for speed, trim, and voyage optimisation etc. While previous studies have focused on predicting ship fuel consumption with respect to a variety of factors, research on the impact of environmental factors on fuel consumption has been lacking. In addition, although recent research efforts have widely focused on machine learning methods to predict fuel consumption, studies on hyperparameter values that are suitable for these prediction models are limited. To compensate for this deficiency in existing literature, an adaptive hyperparameter tuning method is proposed, and the effects of maritime environmental factors on fuel consumption are taken into account. Through experimentation, the proposed adaptive hyperparameter tuning method was validated via artificial neural network (ANN), support vector regression (SVR), random forest (RF), and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso). The hyperparameter tuning proportionally increased the amplitudes of the coefficients of determination (R2) of these algorithms. The increase of the amplitude demonstrated the following trend, in the order of the largest increase to the lowest increase: ANN, Lasso, SVM, and RF. The rates of increase were between 0.0773% and 2.1653%. Furthermore, after the environmental factors were considered, the prediction accuracies of the ANN and Lasso increased; however, the opposite was observed for the SVR and RF. As such, we confirmed that the use of Bayesian optimisation for hyperparameter tuning can effectively improve the fuel consumption prediction accuracy, and our proposed model can therefore serve as a significant reference for calculating fuel consumption.","Bayesian optimization,Hyperparameter tuning,Environmental factors,Ship fuel consumption,Artificial neural network,"
