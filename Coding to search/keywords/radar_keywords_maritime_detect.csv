"dual-band slotted waveguide antenna array for communication, maritime navigation and surveillance radar","2015","This paper describes the development of a dualband slotted waveguide antenna for communication, navigation and surveillance radar applications. Two different slot sizes on opposite faces are designed for enabling antenna operation over two different frequency bands. In this way, it becomes possible to perform diverse sorts of tracking using a unique structure. Numerical results, obtained using ANSYS HFSS, demonstrate the proposed antenna provides two bandwidths of approximately 15% and 6.5% for S-band and C-band, respectively. The antenna gain varies from 12.7dBi at 2.2 GHz to 16.37dBi at 4.6GHz.","multifrequency antennas,C-band,Radar antennas,Antenna arrays,gain 16.37 dB,slot antenna arrays,ANSYS HFSS,dual-band slotted waveguide antenna array,maritime navigation,search radar,S-band,Radar,Slot antennas,Electromagnetic waveguides,radionavigation,bandwidth 4.6 GHz,bandwidth 2.2 GHz,numerical analysis,surveillance radar,gain 12.7 dB,Arrays,"
"adaptation to the clutter environment by airborne maritime surveillance radars","2001","Airborne maritime surveillance radars must detect small targets against a background of sea clutter whilst maintaining surveillance over a large area of sea. This task is very demanding and requires the radar to dynamically adapt to the local environment in order to obtain the best possible detection sensitivity. An aircraft flying at, say 3000 ft would be able to observe an area of sea of about 49,000 km, with a range to the horizon of about 124 km. Over this area, the clutter characteristics observed the radar will be continuously changing as a function of range and look direction. These characteristics will vary in a manner dependent on the prevailing conditions, the radar characteristics and the viewing geometry. In practice, the radar must cope with a very wide dynamic range of signal amplitude, with amplitude statistics varying from those of thermal noise to very spiky sea clutter and land. Continuous adaptation to this environment is required as a function of range and bearing. The dynamic behaviour of the radar as it adapts in this way is often a much more relevant measure of performance than more traditional static measures such as detection range. Methods used to adapt to the environment are surveyed in this paper, together with indications of how their dynamic behaviour can influence performance.","airborne radar,radar characteristics,sea clutter,military radar,viewing geometry,search radar,airborne maritime surveillance radars,marine radar,signal amplitude,radar detection,prevailing conditions,radar clutter,detection sensitivity,dynamic behaviour,small targets,amplitude statistics,"
"maritime anomaly detection in a real-world scenario: ever given grounding in the suez canal","2022","In this paper we present how automatic maritime anomaly detection tools can be successfully applied in real-world situations such as the major event of the container vessel Ever Given, which grounded in the Suez Canal on March 23rd 2021. The anomaly detector is designed to process the available sequence of Automatic Identification System (AIS) reports, information from ground-based or satellite radar systems if available, and contextual information defining the expected nominal behavior of navigation. A statistical hypothesis testing procedure is sequentially run to decide whether or not a deviation from the nominal behavior happened within a specific time period, for instance two consecutive data points. We show, based on the recorded AIS data from the Ever Given, that the proposed detector could have been triggered and alerted to anomalous behavior fully 19 minutes before the grounding.","anomaly detector,Anomaly detection,Marine vehicles,Grounding,statistical hypothesis testing,Ever Given grounding,automatic maritime anomaly detection tools,statistical analysis,Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process,Testing,ships,Containers,automatic identification system,radar,maritime surveillance,satellite radar systems,contextual information,container vessel,Suez Canal,Artificial intelligence,ground-based system,marine engineering computing,Maritime anomaly detection,Irrigation,statistical hypothesis testing procedure,expected nominal behavior,AIS data,"
"fusion detection algorithm of maritime radar and electro-optical pod for complex sea conditions","2023","In order to improve the perceptual capability of Unmanned Surface Vessels (USVs) in complex sea conditions, a fusion detection algorithm has been developed that combines maritime radar and electro-optical (EO) pod. This algorithm integrates the positional state of the USV, class information of the maritime target obtained through a vision-based target detection algorithm, and processed maritime radar information. By using Gaussian and morphological filtering, the fusion of position state information from the USV, EO pod data, and maritime radar data is achieved. This effectively mitigates the negative impact of environmental factors, such as waves and water mist, on target detection. A cooperative sensing process between the maritime radar and EO pod is proposed to fuse the data obtained from both sources, resulting in accurate comprehensive target information. Experimental results show that the fusion algorithm achieves an average accuracy of 80.24% and a detection rate of 74.7%, enabling precise detection of maritime targets, including their distance, speed, and category. This enhanced perceptual capability is essential for USVs operating in complex maritime environments, enabling better decision-making and navigation performance.","maritime radar data,class information,accurate comprehensive target information,sensor fusion,marine radar,electro-optical pod,vision-based target detection algorithm,fusion algorithm,enhanced perceptual capability,target detection,complex maritime environments,positional state,combines maritime radar,fusion detection algorithm,object detection,complex sea conditions,Collaboration,synergistic sensing,Surface morphology,Radar,position state information,Unmanned Surface Vessels,unmanned surface vehicles,detection rate,maritime radar information,Radar imaging,USVs operating,Object detection,Signal processing algorithms,EO pod,maritime target,multi-sensor fusion,Radar detection,"
"target visibility estimation in a buoy mounted maritime forward scatter radar","2015","A buoy mounted maritime forward scatter radar system has been under recent experimental investigation for the detection of small, low speed, low radar cross section (low detectability) maritime targets. One of the main issues regarding target detectability in such a low grazing angle system is the actual visibility of the target due to blocking by waves, especially at higher sea states. Currently experimentation is limited mainly to the lower sea states, mostly using shore mounted antennas in littoral environments; in higher seas and indeed in deep seas with moving antennas, experimentation is more logistically challenging and so initial investigations are being performed through modelling. Thus this paper investigates target observability through consideration of line of sight for selected maritime scenarios and radar topologies for the buoy mounted maritime forward scatter radar system in deep sea conditions.","Antennas,maritime,marine radar,Surface waves,sea states,Power capacitors,littoral environments,observability,Wind speed,maritime forward scatter radar system,radar cross-sections,radar target recognition,maritime targets,Sea surface,Sea state,Radar,grazing angle system,deep sea conditions,radar cross section,visibility,target detectability,buoy mounted maritime forward scatter radar system,target visibility estimation,forward scatter radar,"
"texture anomaly detection in radar imagery","1994","A radar image of the land or sea will contain extended regions of apparently homogeneous textures arising from, for example, forested areas or uniformly driven expanses of water. However, such regions may contain subtle texture anomalies which indicate the presence of a feature of interest such as a change in tree density due to environmental effects, damping of the sea surface due to the presence of pollutants or the presence of land-based or maritime military targets. For this reason, it is of interest to develop methods of detecting anomalies in textured regions. A strategy for texture anomaly detection is to estimate the multi-variate probability density function (PDF) of a texture segment using the whole homogeneous region as training data and then to calculate the likelihood of occurrence of each individual segment within the region given the PDF estimate. Those texture segments with anomalous likelihood values can then be flagged as potential texture anomalies.<>","Image texture analysis,radar imagery,PDF estimate,image texture,texture segment,Statistics,statistical analysis,texture anomaly detection,multi-variate probability density,Radar,radar image,texture segments,radar,"
"an efficient multi-sensor fusion approach for object detection in maritime environments","2018","Robust real-time object detection and tracking are challenging problems in autonomous transportation systems due to operation of algorithms in inherently uncertain and dynamic environments and rapid movement of objects. Therefore, tracking and detection algorithms must cooperate with each other to achieve smooth tracking of detected objects that later can be used by the navigation system. In this paper, we first present an efficient multi-sensor fusion approach based on the probabilistic data association method in order to achieve accurate object detection and tracking results. The proposed approach fuses the detection results obtained independently from four main sensors: radar, LiDAR, RGB camera and infrared camera. It generates object region proposals based on the fused detection result. Then, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) approach is used to identify the object categories within these regions. The CNN is trained on a real dataset from different ferry driving scenarios. The experimental results of tracking and classification on real datasets show that the proposed approach provides reliable object detection and classification results in maritime environments.","detection algorithms,sensor fusion,object categories,reliable object detection,fused detection result,Convolutional Neural Network approach,Cameras,Feature extraction,robust real-time object detection,accurate object detection,multi-sensor fusion,neural nets,dynamic environments,object tracking,navigation system,object detection,Proposals,maritime environments,Radar,convolutional neural networks,object region proposals,Sensor fusion,maritime environment,probabilistic data association method,probability,autonomous transportation systems,Object detection,smooth tracking,region proposals,efficient multisensor fusion approach,autonomous vessel,"
"a novel technique to identify ais transmissions from vessels which attempt to obscure their position by switching their ais transponder from normal transmit power mode to low transmit power mode","2022","Automatic Identification Systems (AIS) are transponder systems installed on marine vessels which transmit the location, speed and other vessel details. These signals are received by shore side AIS Base stations. The use of AIS is mandatory under international SOLAS regulations for certain categories of vessels. AIS is used to monitor for pollution, search and rescue (SAR) and illegal fishing activity. Some vessel operators deliberately interfere with their AIS transponders, including spoofing their real position or switching their AIS transponder to low transmit power, to reduce the likelihood of being detected but still being in compliance with SOLAS regulations. This might suggest that they are involved in nefarious activity. This paper presents a technique to detect vessels which are switching their Class-A, AIS transponders from normal transmit power to low transmit power mode, by utilising the Received Signal strength Indicator field (RSSI) that the receiving Base Station tags incoming AIS messages with. The technique presented, analyses received RSSI in combination with predicted RSSI values via mathematical modelling and presents a unique detection algorithm. Data from the Irish National AIS was used for the study. Although only a small amount of testing was carried out, results showed that for a test vessel which switched its transponder to low power transmit mode, it was found that a specific drop in RSSI of approximately 10 dBm (decibel-milliwatts) was detectable for different distances from the receiving base station.","AIS spoofing,Received signal strength indicator,Low transmit power,Sybil attack,Automatic identification system,"

"waveform selection for a scanning radar in the maritime environment","2021","Detection of slow moving targets for a scanning radar in the maritime domain is typically performed using non-coherent detectors with both pulse-to-pulse and/or scan-to-scan integration.

"exploiting doppler in bernoulli track-before-detect for a scanning maritime radar","2022","Detection and tracking of small targets in sea clutter using high-resolution radar is a challenging problem. Recently, a Bernoulli track-before-detect (TBD) filter has been developed for an airborne scanning radar in the maritime domain, with the purpose of detection and tracking of short-exposure targets by using a fast scanning mode (i.e., short dwell-time and noncoherent integration). This article investigates the potential benefits of coherent radar processing and exploitation of Doppler information in TBD, when the radar operates in a slower scanning mode (i.e., using longer dwell times). For this purpose, a new Bernoulli TBD filter is developed, which is capable of processing full three-dimensional (range-azimuth-Doppler) radar data. The amplitude of sea clutter is modeled using the K distribution with Doppler-dependent shape and scale parameters. Numerical results indicate that the new Bernoulli TBD outperforms the fast scanning TBD filter, at signal-to-interference ratios below 6 dB.","airborne radar,Doppler information,full three-dimensional radar data,scanning maritime radar,airborne scanning radar,marine radar,radar detection,radar clutter,track-before-detect,short-exposure targets,sea clutter,fast scanning mode,Bernoulli TBD filter,fast scanning TBD filter,target tracking,coherent radar processing,range-azimuth-Doppler,filtering theory,Target tracking,maritime domain,Radar tracking,Doppler effect,slower scanning mode,Radar,Doppler,radar tracking,Azimuth,Doppler radar,Radar imaging,high-resolution radar,scale parameters,Bernoulli track-before-detect filter,dwell-time,maritime radar,"

"spaceborne multichannel sar imaging algorithm for maritime moving targets","2023","Spaceborne multichannel synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is an effective means to realize high-resolution and wide-swath imaging. However, for spaceborne multichannel SAR imaging of maritime moving targets, the target motion will cause undesired channel imbalance, i.e., phase error, and further introduce the spurious targets in the image. To solve this problem, this article proposes a novel spaceborne multichannel SAR imaging algorithm for maritime moving targets, which consists of sequential coarse imaging and accurate imaging. The key strategies are to separate different moving targets by coarse imaging and to estimate the phase error based on the relationship between phase errors and amplitudes of spurious targets. First, the quantitative relationship between phase errors and amplitudes of spurious targets is established. Second, based on coarse imaging results, different maritime targets are effectively separated. Then, based on the measured amplitudes of spurious targets, a cost function, which represents the difference between the real target velocity and estimated target velocity, is constructed and minimized to separately estimate the velocities and phase errors of targets. Moreover, to further improve the accuracy of estimation and to suppress the undesired effects caused by target defocusing, clutter, and noise, an iterative strategy is adopted. Finally, by autofocusing, a well-focused SAR image is obtained. The GF-3 dual-channel real data experiment is conducted. The results indicate that the spurious targets are well suppressed, which validates the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.","estimation accuracy improvement,well-focused SAR image,undesired channel imbalance,spectrum reconstruction,radar detection,autofocusing,accurate imaging,real target velocity,Synthetic aperture radar,high-resolution imaging,moving target imaging,iterative strategy,spaceborne multichannel synthetic aperture radar,cost function,estimated target velocity,object detection,nonuniform sampling,synthetic aperture radar,spurious targets,radar imaging,velocity measurement,Radar polarimetry,sequential coarse imaging,Channel imbalance estimation,iterative methods,target defocusing,phase error estimation,Azimuth,target motion,GF-3 dual-channel real data experiment,spaceborne multichannel SAR imaging algorithm,spaceborne radar,Imaging,Signal to noise ratio,wide-swath imaging,parameter estimation,Estimation,multichannel synthetic aperture radar (SAR),Channel estimation,maritime moving targets,"

"automatic detection of rescue targets in maritime search and rescue missions using uavs","2022","Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can be an important resource when performing Search and Rescue (SAR) operations at sea, as this technology is fairly inexpensive when compared to traditional SAR approaches that use significant human resources and expensive air and naval assets, thus enabling the deployment of several UAVs simultaneously in these missions to perform rescue targets search in maritime environments.In order to maximize the usefulness of these UAVs in such operations, we propose a method which utilizes a state-of-the-art object detection network to perform real-time rescue target detection on-board the UAV, using standard RGB cameras, with minimal human intervention, thus enabling an increased vehicle autonomy and search range. Additionally, since the UAVs only relay the candidate images and locations that contain possible rescue targets, given by the onboard detector, it is possible to have several UAVs working in parallel that report back to a single human operator.We have selected the YOLOv4-tiny detection network, pretrained in the COCO dataset, and retrained it to detect rescue targets at sea.

"real-time multi-object tracking using adaptive filtering and filter banks for maritime applications","2021","This paper presents a novel approach to Multi-Object-Tracking (MOT), which solves the well-known problem of maritime surveillance. We use exteroceptive sensors, such as LiDAR, and Automatic Identification System (AIS), to measure the surroundingsâ€™ Vessels. These objects are associated using evidence theory. Afterward, the proposed algorithm tracks all the objects using a new concept: each object is tracked with a respective filter bank consisting of three Adaptive Extended Kalman Filters (AEKF) as subfilters. These have the same prediction model but different correction algorithms based on various measurement sources. The covariance noise matrices are adapted based on the current measurement quality. The filter banks can overcome drawbacks such as wrong and incomplete measurements, thus improving tracking performance.We have validated the algorithm in real-world scenarios in Rostock Harbor, Germany. The proposed algorithm can track all the objects within the view simultaneously in real-time.

"shipnet for semantic segmentation on vhr maritime imagery","2018","For VHR maritime images, sematic segmentation is a new research hotspot and plays an important role in coastline navigation, resource management and territory protection. Without enough labeled training data, it is a challenge to separate small objects on a large scale while segment the big area clearly.

"velocity estimation of maritime targets in spaceborne single-channel sar images: methods and performance assessment","2023","High-resolution images provided by satellite Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) systems are of great interest for maritime surveillance applications. As ship targets can be characterized by complex motions, they usually appear defocused in level-1 SAR images. Previous works have shown the effectiveness of the applications of Inverse SAR (ISAR) techniques to refocus the images of such targets. Apart from achieving well-focused images, also the knowledge of ship velocity is strategic information for surveillance. Therefore, in this work, we analyze the capability of ISAR techniques to estimate the ship translational motion: to this purpose, two different autofocus approaches are considered and compared, one based on the image contrast and the other on the phase gradient algorithm.

"a hybrid approach on generating correlated sea clutter for maritime radar test","2016","Test, measurement and verification of radar are necessary to ensure function according to specification and meet customer requirements. Extensive field tests are often required to test an entire radar system. This is not only expensive, but also requires a great deal of time. To reduce test complexity and cost, simulation techniques are used to recreate real-world conditions in a laboratory environment. Many subsystems can be tested by radar target generators simulating radar echo signals. They usually consider Swerling models, but struggle to simulate clutter, or in particular sea clutter. This paper introduces an approach to generate sea clutter with a state of the art vector signal generator. It shows common approaches modeling sea clutter and introduces a novel approach to combine the statistical models with a physical ocean surface model.

"fast detection of small targets in high-resolution maritime radars by feature normalization and fusion","2022","Joint exploitation of multiple features is a recognized way to implement the effective detection of small targets on the sea in high-resolution maritime radars at the dwelling mode. The tri-feature-based and feature-compression-based detectors use the time-consuming convex hull learning and decision. In this article, a fast feature-fusion-based detector using seven salient features is proposed, where the convex hull learning and decision are replaced by simple threshold determination and decision. It is found that the seven features of sea clutter can be modeled well by the Burr type XII and t-distributions. From the fitted distribution, each feature is normalized to approximate the standard Gaussian distribution by a nonlinear transformation. In the seven-dimensional normalized feature space, an analytical method is given to calculate the optimal weights of feature fusion by the maximization of the interclass distance of the two-class samples. Owing to the normalization of the seven features, the feature fusion loss is significantly reduced comparing with the direct fusion of seven features. The fast feature-fusion-based detector was evaluated on the open and recognized radar databases and offshore experimental data using an unmanned aerial vehicle with a corner reflector. The results show that the fast detector attains competitive performance with the existing best feature-based detector.","nonlinear transformation,t-distributions,small targets on the sea,statistical distributions,sensor fusion,marine radar,corner reflector,feature fusion loss,radar detection,radar clutter,seven features,small targets,Feature extraction,sea clutter,fast detector attains competitive performance,time-consuming convex hull learning,recognized radar databases,standard Gaussian distribution,unmanned aerial vehicle,offshore experimental data,Fast feature-fusion-based detector,Databases,object detection,feature extraction,high-resolution maritime radars,tri-feature-based detectors,Radar,autonomous aerial vehicles,Burr type XII,simple threshold determination,Training,fast detection,feature normalization,seven salient features,feature-compression-based detectors,Clutter,radar resolution,fast feature-fusion-based detector,Gaussian distribution,seven-dimensional normalized feature space,normalized feature space,Detectors,Radar detection,"

The Mode-Selective OTHR introduced herein achieves significant detection and tracking capability against maritime vessels relative to traditional OTHR designs because it is designed specifically to reject disturbed ionospheric propagation modes and operate only using low distortion propagation modes. The architecture of the radar is such that this rejection occurs for both the transmitter-to-surveillance-footprint and the footprint return-to-receiver propagation paths.

"maritime environment perception based on deep learning","2022","Environment perception is an essential aspect of automated maritime vehicles, especially in high-traffic areas. In recent years, deep-learning-based object detection using LiDAR has been well developed in the automotive sector but has not yet seen a similar level of sophisticated development in maritime applications. In these applications, LiDAR detection should be fused with other maritime navigation systems such as the automatic identification system (AIS) to expand the detection range. To address this, we propose a novel deep-learning-based concept for maritime environment perception by using LiDAR as a primary sensor and AIS as an assisting information source. This approach consists of three functional modules: object detection, multi-object tracking, and static environment mapping. For object detection, we apply a convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect floating objects represented as oriented bounding boxes. To train the CNN, we propose a method that generates simulated labeled datasets. The detected objects from CNN are tracked with Kalman Filter banks. The remaining LiDAR data points are treated as static environments and represented by polygons. We evaluated the approach by using simulative and real-world datasets. In the simulation, the average precision of the CNN object detector reaches 60.8%, with a data processing rate of 40 Hz in GPU. Our real-world evaluations show that this approach can track 83% of the vessels in a crowded harbor, with the overall intersection over union reaching 64%.

"computationally effective range migration compensation in pcl systems for maritime surveillance","2018","In this paper, we consider the possibility of extending the coherent processing interval (CPI) as a way to improve target detection capability in passive radars for maritime surveillance applications. Despite the low velocity of the considered targets, range walk effects could limit the performance of the system when long CPIs are considered. To overcome these limitations while keeping the computational load controlled, we resort to a sub-optimal implementation of the Keystone Transform (KT), based on Lagrange polynomial interpolation, recently presented by the authors and successfully applied against aerial targets. Following those promising results, we extend the proposed approach to a coastal surveillance scenario. In the considered case, since longer CPI values are used, the proposed strategy appears to be even more attractive with respect to a conventional KT implementation based on the Chirp-Z Transform interpolation. In fact, comparable detection performance are obtained with a remarkable computational load saving.

Lightning strokes measured by a lightning detection network, human thunderstorm observations at weather stations and convective cells derived from radar reflectivity are used.

Additionally, the cell-based analysis shows that different synoptic conditions are typically associated with specific cell characteristics, such as the direction and speed of movement or cell sizes and severity. These relationships can be explained meaningfully via a description of the synoptic-meteorological characteristics of each of the standard weather patterns.

"concurrent use of satellite imaging and passive acoustics for maritime domain awareness","2010","The research being conducted in the Center for Secure and Resilient Maritime Commerce (CSR), a DHS National Center of Excellence for Port Security examines some basic science issues and emerging technologies to improve the security of ports and inland waterways, as well as coastal and offshore operations. This research follows a layered approach utilizing above water and underwater surveillance techniques. The investigated layers include satellite-based wide area surveillance; HF Radar systems providing over-the-horizon monitoring; and nearshore and harbor passive acoustic surveillance. Integration of these systems is aimed at achieving vessel detection, classification, identification, and tracking. In this paper, we present the results of sea tests where satellite imagery was combined with concurrent passive acoustic surveillance. The wide area sensing was provided by the University of Miami CSTARS facility's electro-optical (EO) and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite imaging capabilities. Satellites detected the ships using a panchromatic EO sensor FormoSat-2 and SAR from the COSMO-SkyMed constellation. The Stevens Passive Acoustic System was used for detecting sound produced by the same ships that were detected by satellites. Concurrent Satellite - Acoustic measurements provide the following advantages: 1. Increasing the probability of small vessel detection and decreasing false alarms. 2. The joint systems can provide redundant detection and classification in conditions where one of the systems fails. For example, EO satellite imaging does not work at night and in fog and cloudy conditions while acoustic detection has limits during stormy weather due to ambient noise. SAR imaging can detect vessels in all weather, but provides less detail about a specific vessel. 3. Acoustics can provide target classification and bearing and satellites can give target localization and heading. SAR data can be used to estimate vessel speed in some cases. 4. Satellite imaging is helpful for the acoustic detection of an underwater target in cases when satellite information allows separation of surface and underwater targets. 5. Joint measurements provide more data (information) for target classification. Several tests were conducted in New York Harbor, where the satellite images and acoustic signatures of the same boats were recorded. The satellite registered a number of small boats. The small boats were acoustically detected at distances up to 4 km and the signal generated by a passenger ferry was observed at a distance up to 7 km.","Satellites,military radar,Stevens passive acoustic system,CSTARS facility's electro-optical radar,maritime domain awareness,acoustic signature,maritime security,underwater vehicles,DHS National Center of Excellence,acoustic detection,satellite tracking,Acoustic sensing,target tracking,Center for Secure and Resilient Maritime Commerce,Miami University,HF radar systems,synthetic aperture radar,satellite imaging,panchromatic EO sensor,underwater surveillance,port security,radar imaging,vessel detection,optical radar,underwater acoustic communication,New York Harbor,Acoustics,offshore operations,Boats,Sonar equipment,coastal operations,satellite sensing,passive acoustics,acoustic surveillance,Surveillance,FormoSat-2,COSMO-SkyMed constellation,Security,target classification,"

"maritime ship target imaging with gnss-based passive multistatic radar","2023","In the field of maritime surveillance, the global navigation satellite system (GNSS)-based passive radar has proven its potential for moving target detection (MTD), localization, and velocity estimation. The next stage is to investigate the possibility of obtaining the radar image of the moving ship for target recognition. However, the limited signal power budget of GNSS prevents the conventional inverse synthetic aperture radar technique that is based on target rotational motion and short observation time for GNSS-based passive radar imaging moving target. In this article, a two-stage imaging processing method relying on the target translational motion over a long observation time is proposed. The first stage confirms the presence of the target by a long-time MTD processing technique. In the second stage, based on the analysis of the Doppler history of the target signal in the slow-time domain, short-time Fourier transform and modified random sample consensus are combined to robustly estimate target velocity with reduced computation complexity. To obtain the focused bistatic image, azimuth compression is conducted by using the estimated target velocity. Finally, an image fusion operation is implemented to combine the bistatic images achievable from multiple satellites so that a multistatic image with high quality can be created. The effectiveness of the proposed method is confirmed by the real experimental results of three cargo ships illuminated by several satellites.","moving ship,Fourier transforms,inverse synthetic aperture radar technique,focused bistatic image,GNSS-based passive multistatic radar,short-time Fourier transform,target detection,passive radar,Marine vehicles,image fusion operation,short observation time,long observation time,maritime ship target imaging,cargo ships,image fusion,target velocity estimation,ships,satellite navigation,maritime surveillance,estimated target velocity,two-stage imaging processing method,object detection,passive radar imaging,synthetic aperture radar,bistatic images,target rotational motion,radar imaging,Doppler effect,Radar,target translational motion,velocity estimation,Global navigation satellite system (GNSS)-based passive radar,Passive radar,Radar imaging,GNSS-based passive radar,target signal,Imaging,long-time MTD processing technique,slow-time domain,radar image,target recognition,multistatic image,Global navigation satellite system,global navigation satellite system-based passive radar,"

"perturbation analysis for maritime applications","2012","Target detection of marine features is a major topic for the security and monitoring of coastlines. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) has been shown to be particularly useful because of its all-weather and night capability. In this paper a methodology based on the perturbation analysis developed by the authors is presented. The latter can be applied for detection of ships (non-marine targets) or classification of sea ice. The algorithm can be considered to be a negative filter focused on sea. Consequently, all the features which have a polarimetric behaviour different from the sea are detected and considered as targets. A complete validation with RADARSAT-2 full polarimetric data was performed in Portsmouth, UK. An accurate ground truth carried out during the acquisition, was accompanied, considering AIS GPS location and photographic evidences.

"designing intelligent coastal surveillance based on big maritime data","2020","The ocean is classified into several territorial regimes that span from internal waters, archipelagic waters, territorial seas, contiguous zones, exclusive economic zones (EEZ), and high seas. The relevant state authorities must perform surveillance of all ships that navigate through their respective territories to ensure the ship safety and prevent them from carrying out illegal activities such as illegal unregulated and unreported (IUU) fishing, illegal firearms smuggling, and piracy. Currently, maritime domain surveillance is carried out using a combination of Automatic Identification System (AIS), Coastal Radar System (CRS), and Long Range Camera (LRC). The massive amount of incoming data from these surveillance systems produce big maritime data. However, big maritime data is useless without artificial intelligence intervention. This research proposed an intelligent system that provides and analyzes ship path planning, identifies suspicious ships, track ships, and approaches and attacks target ships using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm.

"unmanned aerial vehicle landing on maritime vessels using signal prediction of the ship motion","2018","Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are becoming more prevalent in maritime operations. For safe operation, one of the key challenges of using UAVs at sea is the relative motion that exists between the UAV and ship. For perpetual maritime operations, UAV systems need to be able to land safely on ocean vessels. Determining a `quiescent period', where the roll and pitch angles of the ship are below a danger threshold, is a challenging problem for UAV systems. In general, current strategies rely on reactive systems and often use sensors on board the maritime vessel. The scope of the current paper is a proof-of-concept methodology which uses a signal prediction algorithm to facilitate safer autonomous UAV-ship landings. This study uses laser ranging and detecting devices (LIDAR) in conjunction with a signal prediction algorithm (SPA) to forecast when the ship motion is within safe landing limits. ShipMo3D was used to generate twelve trial cases for UAV-ship landings on a 33 m ship. The results show that with the use of the SPA, the number of UAV landing attempts was decreased by an average of 2 attempts, per test case, when compared to a system that did not use an SPA. Moreover, the results indicate that with revised tuning of the SPA, the likelihood of a safe landing can be further improved.","maritime vessel,ShipMo3D,Prediction algorithms,Marine vehicles,Mathematical model,laser ranging,ship motion,Laser radar,laser ranging and detecting devices,unmanned aerial vehicle landing,ships,aircraft landing guidance,optical radar,autonomous UAV-ship landings,autonomous aerial vehicles,Tracking,ocean vessels,Unmanned aerial vehicles,LIDAR,perpetual maritime operations,signal prediction algorithm,SPA,Brushless motors,"
"deep learning to enhance maritime situation awareness","2019","Maritime surveillance sensors like AIS (Automatic Identification System) and Radar provide useful information for decision-making support, which is of paramount importance for effective operations against maritime threats and illegal activities [1]. However, decision-making systems that trust solely on AIS information tend to fail in real situations because such information could be missing, inaccurate or even deceptive [2]. On the other hand, only Radar information is not enough to get a complete description of the maritime situational picture. This paper proposes a deep learning framework for vessel monitoring that examines a particular scenario where a deep learning solution can infer a navigation status based on the vessels trajectories, and thus to detect suspicious vessels activities. For this purpose, a dataset, named DeepMarine, has been specifically created by collecting data of AIS historical recordings. We demonstrate the performance of the developed deep learning framework for the proposed vessels activity classification, which can be ultimately used to report illegal activities.","decision support systems,surveillance,sensor fusion,marine radar,maritime situation,decision-making systems,Anomaly detection,vessel activity classification,deep learning solution,marine navigation,maritime threats,navigation status,neural nets,military computing,illegal activities,DeepMarine,automatic identification system,marine safety,AIS historical recordings,Databases,radar information,pattern classification,vessel trajectories,maritime situational picture,Radar,decision-making support,suspicious vessel activities,deep learning framework,Trajectory,Deep learning,AIS information,Navigation,marine vehicles,vessel monitoring,learning (artificial intelligence),data handling,maritime surveillance sensors,"
"beidou-based passive multistatic radar maritime moving target detection technique via spaceâ€“time hybrid integration processing","2022","This article puts forward a BeiDou-based passive multistatic radar (PMR) maritime moving target (MMT) detection technique via spaceâ€“time hybrid integration (STHI) processing. Compared with passive bistatic radar (PBR), the utilization of multiple satellites provides an improvement in MMT detection performance, together with the capabilities of localization and velocity estimation. However, the multiple satellite transmitters cause the differences principally in bistatic range and Doppler centroid (DC) of the MMT. To integrate the PMR echoes, the biggest challenge is the two differences that need to be handled. In the proposed technique, first, the centroid-compensated keystone transform (CCKT) is proposed and applied to each PBR echo. It not only corrects range cell migration (RCM) but also equalizes the DC to the same. Then, the long-time integration is performed on each PBR echo, after which it is integrated into the range-Doppler frequency rate (DFR) domain. Finally, in order to settle the difference in bistatic range, an MMT position and velocity domain (i.e., the  $X$ â€“ $Y$ â€“ $V$  domain) is constituted. The obtained multiple range-DFR maps are projected to the  $X$ â€“ $Y$ â€“ $V$  domain, and then, the effective integration of multistatic echoes can be implemented. The final STHI result allows detecting the MMT reliably. Meanwhile, according to the 3-D position where the MMT is located in the  $X$ â€“ $Y$ â€“ $V$  domain, the MMT can be localized, and its velocity can be estimated simultaneously. In May 2021, we have successfully carried out the worldâ€™s first BeiDou-based PMR MMT detection experiment, and the experimental results are given to prove the effectiveness of this technique.","Satellites,MMT position,range cell migration,marine radar,MMT detection performance,radar detection,passive radar,PBR echo,RCM,transforms,passive bistatic radar,Radio transmitters,STHI processing,BeiDou-based PMR MMT detection technique,space-time hybrid integration processing,satellite navigation,centroid-compensated keystone transform,maritime surveillance,maritime moving target (MMT) detection,object detection,BeiDou-based passive radar,spaceâ€“time hybrid integration (STHI),PMR echoes,bistatic range,Doppler effect,multistatic echoes,Doppler centroid,Satellite broadcasting,range-Doppler frequency rate domain,multiple satellite transmitters,Doppler radar,Passive radar,BeiDou-based passive multistatic radar maritime moving target detection technique,Receivers,spaceborne radar,CCKT,Multistatic radar,passive multistatic radar (PMR),radar cross-sections,range-DFR domain,multiple range-DFR maps,"
"information fusion and tracking using bernoulli filters for maritime surveillance","2022","This paper concerns the application of information fusion and Bernoulli filtering to a maritime surveillance scenario. Sensor data was recorded during live trials featuring a static Leonardo Osprey maritime surveillance active electronic scan array (AESA) radar observing a cooperative rigid inflatable boat (RIB) target deployed in the Firth of Forth estuary north of Edinburgh, UK. The RIB was equipped with a global positioning system (GPS) and an automatic identification system (AIS) recording geodetic position over time, where the collected data is fused to generate ground truth. A multi-target joint detection and tracking (MTJDT) algorithm is used to both detect and track the RIB target from post-processed radar and AIS data whilst ignoring other information regarding objects and sources of interference. Generalised optimal sub-pattern assignment (GOSPA) and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis are used to evaluate target detection, localisation, and cardinality performance quantification. Results suggest conventional data processing and the proposed tracking algorithm achieve reasonable detection and tracking performance under the assumption that the ground truth well-represents the RIB position without knowledge of error statistics, but track divergence and discontinuities occur due to radar obscuration by buildings, data inaccuracies and clutter.","maritime surveillance scenario,sensor fusion,marine radar,reasonable detection,geodetic position,multitarget joint detection,target detection,Global Positioning System,information fusion,information regarding objects,target tracking,global positioning system,image fusion,sensor data,automatic identification system,data inaccuracies,filtering theory,boats,RIB target,static Leonardo Osprey maritime surveillance active electronic scan array radar,object detection,radar interference,video recording,radar imaging,radar receivers,bernoulli filters,conventional data processing,radar tracking,clutter,radar obscuration,post processed radar,rigid inflatable boat target,video surveillance,track divergence,RIB position,AIS data,"
"moving ship optimal association for maritime surveillance: fusing ais and sentinel-2 data","2022","Nowadays, a variety of different sources can be combined together to measure and monitor maritime human activities. Reliable data fusion techniques are essential to associate the targets from different systems for maritime surveillance. In particular, the fusion of data from Sentinel-2 satellites and the automatic identification system (AIS) has attracted wide attention due to their public availability and complementarity. However, most traditional methods for target association are not suitable for this particular case, due to the time lag phenomenon of Sentinel-2 data. In this study, we first construct two new datasets for the detection of moving ships and their wakes based on Sentinel-2 images. Combined with the detection results obtained by the you only look once (YOLOv5) model, the position and course information of the detected ships are first extracted. After carefully analyzing the time lag phenomenon of Sentinel-2 data, we develop a new domain adaptation-based method for target association based on the fusion of Sentinel-2 and AIS data, called moving ship optimal association (MSOA). Different from standard domain adaptation methods only for representation alignment, the proposed MSOA is able to align representation, time, and position simultaneously. A case study is provided in which the newly proposed method is tested over the Port of Long Beach, USA. Experimental results demonstrate that both moving ships and wakes are well detected. Specifically, our newly proposed MSOA exhibits more accurate and robust performance when compared to traditional methods, and the detected ships without corresponding AIS tracks can also be detected by our MSOA. Moreover, the real sensing time and time lag of Sentinel-2 data are deduced with high accuracy. Overall, it can be concluded that our MSOA provides a new perspective for accurate target association based on heterogeneous data fusion.","surveillance,Remote sensing,sensor fusion,remote sensing,MSOA,time lag,ship detection,detected ships,heterogeneous data fusion,Marine vehicles,domain adaptation,ship optimal association,Data fusion,accurate target association,geophysical image processing,Sentinel-2 images,target tracking,Optical sensors,ships,time lag phenomenon,maritime surveillance,Target tracking,target association,you only look once (YOLO),Artificial intelligence,radar tracking,moving ships,Sentinel-2 satellites,Sensors,Surveillance,maritime surveillance (MS),domain adaptation-based method,reliable data fusion techniques,AIS data,Sentinel-2 data,"

"maritime target detection based on radar graph data and graph convolutional network","2022","Due to the complex sea clutter environment and target features, the conventional statistical theory-based methods cannot achieve high performance in maritime target detection tasks. Conventional deep learning, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs)-based target detection methods process each signal sample independently, and the temporal-spatial domain correlation information is seldom used. To achieve full utilization of information contained in radar signals and improve the detection performance, a graph convolutional network (GCN) is considered, which has shown great advantages in graph data processing and has been applied in the field of signal processing. This letter proposed a maritime target detection method based on radar signal graph data and graph convolution. Graph structure data is applied to define the detection units and to represent the temporal and spatial information of detection units. The target detection of the signal corresponding to the nodes is conducted via GCN. Experimental results show that the proposed approach can effectively detect marine targets when the signal-to-noise ratio is above âˆ’5 dB and can effectively suppress false alarms in the pure clutter area, which is not adjacent to targets.

"satellite surveillance of fishing vessel activity in the ascension island exclusive economic zone and marine protected area","2019","Designation of large expanses of the ocean as Marine Protected Area (MPA) is increasingly advocated and realised. The effectiveness of such MPAs, however, requires improvements to vessel monitoring and enforcement capability. In 2014 commercial fishing was excluded from the Ascension Island Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). In 2015, through updated regulations, a licenced fishery re-opened in the northern half of the EEZ while the southern half remained closed. To assess compliance with these closures and regulations, several promising satellite technologies (Satellite Automatic Identification System (S-AIS), Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) of two vessels), were trialled alongside at-sea patrols. Use of SAR enabled assessment of ‘dark’ (non-AIS transmitting) vessels, the scope of whose activities are hardest to gauge. The high level of compliance with regulations observed, suggests the MPA may prove effective, yet a need for vigilance remains. Vessels aggregate near the EEZ border and a quarter of vessels tracked across three years exhibited S-AIS transmission gaps and present a heightened compliance risk. Use of remote, rather than local, expertise and infrastructure provide a blue-print and economies of scale for replicating monitoring across similarly sized MPAs; particularly for large (>~ 25 m) vessels with metallic superstructures conducive to SAR detection. Funding ongoing monitoring in Ascension is challenged by current levels of license uptake, which provides insufficient offsetting revenue. Satellite-derived intelligence, can be used to set risk thresholds and trigger detailed investigations. Planning long-term monitoring must, however, incorporate adequate resources for follow-up, through patrols and correspondence with flag-states and fisheries management organisations.","Satellite surveillance,Marine Protected Area,Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction,Compliance,High seas,Fisheries,"
"maritime radar target detection in sea clutter based on cnn with dual-perspective attention","2023","Radar-based maritime target detection plays an important role in ocean monitoring. Considering the practical application, pulse-compression radar is widely used in terms of civilian offshore surface target detection. The existence of sea clutter will greatly interfere the detection performance of pulse-compression radar. This leads to the low detection performance of traditional algorithms like constant false alarm rate (CFAR). Deep learning methods have made strides in many fields recently, such as natural language processing and speech recognition. Inspired by this idea, we propose a maritime radar target detection method in sea clutter based on convolution neural network (CNN) and dual-perspective attention (DPA). The proposed method first encodes the radar echo in high-dimensional space and then extracts the correlation features from the global and local perspectives through the attention mechanism. We deployed the X-band pulse-compression radar on the coast of Hainan, China, and collected a lot of measured data. Experimental results demonstrate that the detection performance of our method outperforms the traditional CFAR methods and the latest deep learning-based methods.

"random finite set tracking for anomaly detection in the presence of clutter","2020","In this paper, a sequential Bayesian framework is proposed to address the task of joint anomaly detection and tracking for surveillance applications in the presence of clutter. This is achieved by modeling the anomaly as a switching unknown control input which goes into action by modifying the expected dynamics of a target and ceases its activity (becomes nonexistent) under nominal behavior. Random Finite Sets (RFS) make it possible to represent the switching nature of the object anomalous behavior and derive a hybrid Bernoulli filter (HBF) that sequentially updates the joint posterior density of a Bernoulli RFS for the unknown velocity input and the object kinematic state. In addition, the proposed HBF has been customized for maritime anomaly detection by using a piecewise Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) stochastic process as dynamic model of vessels.

This algorithm summarizes the optimization objectives and constraint conditions of the MSAR mission area planning according to search theory, carries out the parametric modeling of mission area legitimately and obtains the global optimal solution by continuous exploration in the parameter definition domain. On this basis, by analyzing the time-space weight of drift prediction data, the optimization results are further improved. Finally, through the case simulation analysis, it can be seen that the TS-PSO algorithm can effectively make up for the deficiency of the CIS algorithm and further improve the success probability of optimal MSAR mission area.","CIS algorithm,emergency management,search theory,Global optimal solution,Prediction algorithms,cellular iterative search algorithm,Planning,Search problems,optimization objectives,maritime search and rescue,particle swarm optimisation,Helicopters,search and rescue decision-making,global optimal solution,local optimal solution,helicopter maritime search,optimal MSAR mission area,iterative methods,Partitioning algorithms,Optimization,search problems,TS-PSO algorithm,mission area planning,probability,rescue unit,particle swarm optimization algorithm,Heuristic algorithms,time-space weight,"
"cyber incident scenarios in the maritime industry: risk assessment and mitigation strategies","2023","The maritime industry is facing an escalating concern of cybersecurity threats, which can be attributed to the rapid growth of digital technologies and the recent adoption of autonomous and semi-autonomous shipping. To address this issue, various published papers have proposed cyberattack scenarios aiming to increase cybersecurity awareness and enhance the security of maritime systems. This research aims to assess the cybersecurity threats in the maritime sector by presenting three practical cyberattack scenarios and their corresponding risks and mitigation strategies. The first scenario involves the risks associated with utilizing the systems of a tug-boat as part of an attack vector, the second scenario examines the systems involved in vessel harbour manoeuvres using a laser docking system or Radar, and the third scenario examines an insider attack through malicious or unauthorized access to the Berthing Aid System (BAS).","escalating concern,computer network security,Risk management,Safety,computer crime,Personnel,Industries,Companies,cyber-physical systems,Laser radar,Berthing Aid System,corresponding risks,ships,cybersecurity awareness,recent adoption,boats,risk management,cybersecurity threats,sea ports,mitigation strategies,risk assessment,cyber incident scenarios,maritime systems,marine communication,semiautonomous shipping,maritime industry,maritime sector,digital technologies,laser docking system,Radar detection,"
"an automated sar-based method for ship detection in maritime surveillance system","2023","Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is an active Earth observation system that can obtain high-resolution ocean images all day and all weather. It can be used for monitoring the marine environment, maritime traffic, and oil spills at sea. SAR provides accurate and real-time ocean information, which can ensure water traffic safety and ecological environment. Therefore, it plays an irreplaceable role in maritime surveillance. At present, deep-learning based object detection methods have achieved certain results in the application of ship detection in SAR images. Ship targets in SAR images have strong angular reflection characteristics, causing some parts of them to have large grayscale values, appearing as scattering points. At the same time, the heading of ship usually has a certain angle with the horizontal direction. Traditional deep-learning models do not have sufficient generalization ability for these situations. Horizontal bounding boxes also contain a large amount of background features, which affects the accuracy of the model. In response to these characteristics, first use convolutional neural network to extract ship features; Secondly, generate oriented proposals to reduce the impact of background features; Thirdly, using Canny and Harris to obtain features of ship edges and scattering points as attention mechanisms to enhance bounding box regression and classification; Finally, optimize the loss function, which will consider the influence of angle. Comparative experiments were conducted on the SSDD dataset, and the experimental results showed that compared to existing methods, the improved model has better ship detection performance and can achieve accurate detection of small ship targets in complex scene SAR images.","Oceans,ship detection in SAR images,ship edge,Object detection,scattering key point,Surveillance,Radar polarimetry,attention mechanism,Scattering,Biological system modeling,Feature extraction,maritime surveillance,"
"enhanced winter snowmelt in the antarctic peninsula: automatic snowmelt identification from radar scatterometer","2020","Surface snowmelt affects the energy balance through melt-albedo feedback and may endanger the ice shelves in the Antarctic Peninsula (AP) through hydrofracture. Here, we introduce an automatic snowmelt identification algorithm based on Quick Scatterometer and Advanced Scatterometer. The proposed method can provide self-adaptive thresholds for snowmelt detection based on Rosin thresholding, and is able to detect weak melt signals with a wavelet denoising procedure. Results suggest the AP surface snowmelt has slightly declined during 1999–2018 in the context of recent cooling. However, winter melt index (i.e., melt days times the area of melting) has significantly increased (above the 99% confidence level) with a rate of 83% decade−1. Unprecedented winter snowmelt was found in 2015/2016 when about one-third of the AP experienced snowmelt in late May. This may be attributed to the intrusions of marine air and the enhanced föhn-driven warming resulted from the abnormal northwesterly flow driven by a significant deepening of the Amundsen Sea Low.","Rosin thresholding,Winter snowmelt,Scatterometer,Antarctic Peninsula,Wavelet denoising,"
"asynchronous trajectory matching-based multimodal maritime data fusion for vessel traffic surveillance in inland waterways","2023","The automatic identification system (AIS) and video cameras have been widely exploited for vessel traffic surveillance in inland waterways. The AIS data could provide vessel identity and dynamic information on vessel position and movements. In contrast, the video data could describe the visual appearances of moving vessels without knowing the information on identity, position, movements, etc. To further improve vessel traffic surveillance, it becomes necessary to fuse the AIS and video data to simultaneously capture the visual features, identity, and dynamic information for the vessels of interest. However, the performance of AIS and video data fusion is susceptible to issues such as data spatial difference, message asynchronous transmission, visual object occlusion, etc. In this work, we propose a deep learning-based simple online and real-time vessel data fusion method (termed DeepSORVF). We first extract the AIS-and video-based vessel trajectories, and then propose an asynchronous trajectory matching method to fuse the AIS-based vessel information with the corresponding visual targets. In addition, by combining the AIS-and video-based movement features, we also present a prior knowledge-driven anti-occlusion method to yield accurate and robust vessel tracking results under occlusion conditions. To validate the efficacy of our DeepSORVF, we have also constructed a new benchmark dataset (termed FVessel) for vessel detection, tracking, and data fusion. It consists of many videos and the corresponding AIS data collected in various weather conditions and locations. The experimental results have demonstrated that our method is capable of guaranteeing high-reliable data fusion and anti-occlusion vessel tracking. The DeepSORVF code and FVessel dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/gy65896/DeepSORVF and https://github.com/gy65896/FVessel, respectively.","Trajectory,deep neural network,anti-occlusion tracking,Visualization,Radar tracking,Object detection,vessel traffic surveillance,Artificial intelligence,Inland waterways,Surveillance,Data integration,data fusion,"

"application of the jpda-ukf to hfsw radars for maritime situational awareness","2012","At the present day, growing interest is paid to the development of more reliable surveillance systems for maritime situational awareness (MSA). The purpose is to detect, track and classify cooperative and non-cooperative targets. For this reason, great interest is given to low-power/cost High-Frequency Surface-Wave (HFSW) radars as an early-warning tool for over-the-horizon (OTH) applications. However, in HFSW radars there is a trade-off in terms of quality and cost, i.e. the radar system exhibits poor azimuth resolution, high non-linearity, and significant false alarm rate. All these aspects reduce tracking performance if not properly addressed. In this context, the Joint Probabilistic Data Association (JPDA) with the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) is proposed. The tracking algorithm behavior is investigated by a comparison between the tracks generated by two HFSW radars, with overlapped fields of view, and Automatic Identification System (AIS) data.

"maritime target tracking from an airborne multi-channel radar","2022","Detection and tracking of small maritime targets using high-resolution airborne radar is a difficult problem due to the non-stationary and non-Gaussian nature of sea clutter. This paper develops a target tracking algorithm for a scanning multi-channel radar operating in the maritime environment. The detection scheme uses space time adaptive processing (STAP) with a relatively high false alarm rate. While this improves the overall probability of detection, there are also a multitude of false (spurious) detections. As the radar scans, the target is illuminated over a range of azimuth angles, resulting in a large number of detections per target. A solution based on clustering the STAP output is proposed to create equivalent point target measurements, with the clustering output subsequently processed by a standard point-detection Bernoulli tracking filter. Through numerical simulations of high-fidelity airborne radar data, we demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves reliable tracking of targets characterised with low signal-to-interference ratios.","airborne radar,Clustering algorithms,radar scans,radar detection,radar clutter,equivalent point target measurements,STAP,high-resolution airborne radar,Sea measurements,sea clutter,false detections,STAP output,clustering output,space time adaptive processing,nonGaussian nature,target tracking,numerical simulations,maritime surveillance,Target tracking,small maritime target detection,object detection,extended target tracking,small maritime target tracking,detection scheme,signal-to-interference ratios,nonstationary nature,Radar,radar signal processing,high false alarm rate,airborne multichannel radar,target tracking algorithm,space-time adaptive processing,standard point-detection Bernoulli tracking filter,Airborne radar,maritime environment,probability,Surveillance,high-fidelity airborne radar data,Spaceborne radar,maritime target tracking,tracking filters,scanning multichannel radar,Radar detection,"
"ocean oil spill detection from sar images based on multi-channel deep learning semantic segmentation","2023","One of the major threats to marine ecosystems is pollution, particularly, that associated with the offshore oil and gas industry. Oil spills occur in the world's oceans every day, either as large-scale spews from drilling-rig or tanker accidents, or as smaller discharges from all sorts of sea-going vessels. In order to contribute to the timely detection and monitoring of oil spills over the oceans, we propose a new Multi-channel Deep Neural Network (M-DNN) segmentation model and a new and effective Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) image dataset, that enable us to emit forewarnings in a prompt and reliable manner. Our proposed M-DNN is a pixel-level segmentation model intended to improve previous DNN oil-spill detection models, by taking into account multiple input channels, complex oil shapes at different scales (dimensions) and evolution in time, and look-alikes from low wind speed conditions. Our methodology consists of the following components: 1) New Multi-channel SAR Image Database Development; 2) Multi-Channel DNN Model based on U-net and ResNet; and 3) Multi-channel DNN Training and Transfer Learning. Due to the lack of public oil spill databases guaranteeing a correct learning process of the M-DNN, we developed our own database consisting of 16 ENVISAT-ASAR images acquired over the Gulf of Mexico during the Deepwater Horizon (DWH) blowout, off the west coast of South Korea during the Hebei Spirit oil tanker collision, and over the Black Sea.

"potential analysis of maritime oil spill monitoring based on modis thermal infrared data","2009","Remote sensing is a mayor way of oil spill monitoring nowadays. Compared to these active sensors, such as NIR or SAR, thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing also have capability to identify oil on backgrounds that include water, soil, ice and snow, in terms of its useful covering the TIR bands which can monitor the thermal radiance difference between them. The difference in the thermal radiance properties of oil and sea water retrieved from radiance allow potential discrimination. The essential objective in this work is to use in-situ sea surface temperature (SST) data retrieved by MODIS SST algorithm, obtain SST image information, and identify oil film from sea water. Furthermore by means of thermal infrared mapping, the feature dependent on oil film temperature change can contribute to discriminate the thickness change and trend of oil film, which is crucial to oil spill contingency planning. In both cases, the thermal infrared remote sensing obtained demonstrated the ability to achieve good results.","Infrared surveillance,remote sensing,Thermal sensors,hydrological techniques,ocean temperature,oil spill contingency planning,thermal radiance difference,thermal infrared remote sensing,Infrared sensors,seawater,soil,oil film temperature change,Petroleum,in-situ sea surface temperature data,water,SST image information,thermal infrared mapping,Remote monitoring,in-situ SST data,sea surface temperature,TIR bands,MODIS SST algorithm,MODIS thermal infrared data,Soil,MODIS,ice,marine pollution,Snow,maritime oil spill monitoring,Ocean temperature,Ice,snow,oil spill monitoring,"
"surveillance in maritime scenario using deep learning and swarm intelligence","2022","Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have played a crucial role in supporting Search and Rescue (SAR) Operations due to their fast movement capabilities and flexibility. During a search and rescue operation scenario, the time constraint is a crucial parameter, so the required time to detect humans in distress with precision is also a vital part. Modern Deep learning algorithms like CNN also aid in these missions. However, most models and datasets available focus on search and rescue missions on the ground or land. UAV-based search and rescue operations in the Maritime Scenario remain a challenge. This study focused on using deep learning algorithms such as CNN to precisely detect a human in peril with a swarm of drones. At the same time, we emphasize using swarm intelligence algorithms such as Particle Swarm Algorithm (PSO) to effectively find a victim in the shortest time by exploring a massive area. The distinctiveness of this system is that it combines the model with the best accuracy to detect and the best swarm intelligence algorithm for finding targets in the quickest time possible, thus enhancing the surveillance mission. In this research, among VGG16, ResNet50V2, InceptionV3, Xception, and MobileNetV2 models, VGG16 produced an IoU (Intersection over Union) score of 0.62 with a Class Label accuracy of 99.15% and Bounding Box accuracy of 88.74% in CNN part.

"maritime moving target long time integration for gnss-based passive bistatic radar","2018","This paper addresses the exploitation of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) as transmitters of opportunity in passive bistatic radar systems for maritime surveillance. The main limitation of this technology is the restricted power budget provided by navigation satellites, which makes it necessary to define innovative moving target detection techniques specifically tailored for the system under consideration. To this aim, this paper puts forward long integration time techniques able to collect the signal energy over long time intervals (tens of seconds), allowing the retrieval of suitable levels of signal-to-disturbance ratios for detection purposes. A local plane based technique is first considered, providing target detection in a plane that represents the section of maritime area covered by the radar antenna. As a suboptimum solution in terms of achievable integration gain, but more efficient from a computational point of view, a second technique is considered working in the conventional bistatic range and Doppler plane (basic plane based).

"target reflectivity and rcs interactions in integrated maritime surveillance systems based on surface-wave high-frequency radars","2001","Abnormal fluctuations have been observed in detected power levels of some of the targets during trials of the integrated maritime surveillance system (IMS) based on the Canadian east coast surface-wave high-frequency radar (HFSWR). The power level of most of the surface and air targets fluctuated within measurement-error limits (a few dB) during consecutive detections. These fluctuations have been observed to be more than 15 dB for a huge oil platform and nearby large tankers. These fluctuations are quite different than those observed in microwave radars, such as pulse-to-pulse or scan-to-scan fluctuations (which are modeled as different Swerling-type targets), and as are mentioned in most of the classical radar handbooks. In order to understand the reason behind these fluctuations, the behavior of the target reflectivity and radar cross section (RCS) of surface and air targets and their mutual RCS interaction were investigated. Powerful numerical techniques were used to model and understand the target reflectivity and RCS interactions, mostly in the resonance regime. Different scenarios were created, and the mutual RCS behavior of nearby large targets (such as oil tankers and/or fixed offshore oil platforms) as they were maneuvering were modeled. It was shown that 10 dB to 20 dB RCS fluctuations should be expected when targets interact, especially in the resonance regime.","marine radar,oil platform,radar detection,radar applications,surface-wave high-frequency radar,RCS interactions,maneuvering targets,Radar cross section,Petroleum,electromagnetic wave reflection,measurement-error limits,Radar scattering,surface electromagnetic waves,radar target detection,Offshore installations,oil tanker,surface-wave HF radar,Sea surface,search radar,air targets,detected power levels,Radar clutter,Fluctuations,Canadian east coast,target reflectivity,radar cross section,integrated maritime surveillance systems,surface targets,resonance regime,Surveillance,radar cross-sections,Reflectivity,Radar detection,"
"a data processing method of maritime surveillance radar on mechanical and electronical scanning mode","2020","The maritime surveillance radar is prone to have the problems of false track initiation and tracking loss due to the low tracking accuracy of the target using the traditional data processing strategy. To solve these problems, a data processing strategy is proposed based on a mechanical and electronical scanned radar. As the problem of velocity ambiguity is caused by far detection distance and low pulse repetition frequency (PRF), the overlapping algorithm is used and the corresponding constraints are employed for optimization. The problem of too many false tracks as a result of background noise is solved by using Hough transform and logic-based algorithm optimized under the relevant constraints. In addition, an optimization method of Kalman filtering is proposed based on the predicted value of the stable course of maritime targets to solve track jitter.

Consequently the radar might be operated on an elevator moving along a mast. This offers the possibility to adjust the antenna height adaptively depending on the current atmospheric conditions. The possibility of utilizing an elevator moving along a mast and thus change the antenna position in height implies for the future for each site to require only one antenna instead of - so far - two antennas, one antenna about 40 - 60 m aloft and another so-called Duct-antenna at ground level to meet the Duct problem.","maritime environment,meteorological conditions,duct situations,marine radar,Radar antennas,Ducts,Meteorological radar,radar detection,radar antenna height,optimal radar antenna heights,antenna position,Standards,radar antennas,Radar detection,"
"radar-based maritime collision avoidance using dynamic window","2018","Collision avoidance systems are a key ingredient in developing autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs). Such systems require real-time information about the environment, which can be obtained from transponder-based systems or exteroceptive sensors located on the ASV. In this paper, we present a closed-loop collision avoidance (COLAV) system using a maritime radar for detecting target ships, implemented on a 26 foot high-speed ASV. The system was validated in full-scale experiments in Trondheimsfjorden, Norway, in May 2017. The probabilistic data association filter (PDAF) is used for tracking target vessels. The output from the PDAF is processed through a least-squares retrodiction procedure in order to provide the COLAV system with sufficiently accurate course estimates. A tracking interface provides estimates of target states to the COLAV system, which is based on the dynamic window (DW) algorithm. DW is a reactive COLAV algorithm originally designed for ground vehicles, and we therefore make a number of modifications to adapt it for use with high-speed ASVs. The closed-loop experiments demonstrated successful COLAV with this system, but also disclosed several challenges arising from both the DW algorithm and the tracking system, motivating for further work.","sensor fusion,transponder-based systems,exteroceptive sensors,course estimates,collision avoidance systems,transponders,dynamic window algorithm,PDAF,target tracking,reactive COLAV algorithm,ships,COLAV system,closed loop systems,maritime collision avoidance,Target tracking,real-time information,Radar tracking,autonomous surface vehicles,Artificial intelligence,vessels,tracking system,Telemetry,mobile robots,Sensors,closed-loop collision avoidance system,high-speed ASV,collision avoidance,probabilistic data association filter,Heuristic algorithms,maritime radar,"
"lmd-tshipâ‹†: vision based large-scale maritime ship tracking benchmark for autonomous navigation applications","2021","Accurate ship tracking is very important for the security of maritime activities, especially the raising requirements of autonomous navigation applications, e.g., autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs). Unlike deep-learning-based object-tracking methods are prevailing in autonomous driving because of good environmental robustness and high tracking accuracy, few deep-tracking models can be found for maritime ships. The main reason for that is the lack of qualified ship datasets, especially datasets with ship-based perspectives. Therefore, a large-scale, high-definition dataset for ship tracking, LMD-TShip (Large Maritime Dataset), is provided in this paper. In this dataset, five types of ships are included, from cargo ships, fishing ships, passenger ships, and speed boats to unmanned ships. Specifically, LMD-TShip consists of 40,240 frames in 191 videos, each of which is carefully and manually annotated with bounding boxes in YOLO format. Moreover, 13 attributes are used to label videos, e.g., scale variation (SV), occlusion (OCC), basically covering tracking challenges of maritime ship tracking. Next, a detailed analysis is carried out to demonstrate the characteristics of LMD-TShip. Finally, experiments with five baseline short-term tracking models on the dataset are performed, e.g., ECO, SiamRPN++, and the experimental results demonstrate its good evaluation ability, which will provide effective means for training and testing tracking models related to maritime ships.","LMD-TShip,speed boats,Hidden Markov models,YOLO format,Cameras,Marine vehicles,tracking accuracy,cargo ships,ship tracking dataset,Videos,Visual tracking,video annotation,object tracking,ships,maritime activities security,Biological system modeling,unmanned ships,boats,Target tracking,object detection,deep-learning-based object-tracking methods,image annotation,Radar tracking,autonomous surface vehicles,telerobotics,autonomous driving,video signal processing,maritime environment,unmanned surface vehicles,mobile robots,passenger ships,deep-tracking models,vision based large-scale maritime ship tracking benchmark,autonomous navigation,fishing ships,Large Maritime Dataset,autonomous navigation applications,"
"target extraction and imaging of maritime targets in the sea clutter spectrum using sparse separation","2017","Detection and imaging of endoclutter maritime targets is a difficult problem, because the signal return of the target and the clutter overlap in both Doppler frequency and time.

"maritime automated targets recognition algorithm test bed for high resolution isar imagery","2013","A maritime automatic target recognition system is under development to perform ship classification using images from inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) systems. This work will describe the algorithm framework for feature extraction, classification, and aim-point recognition. ISAR systems produce two-dimensional images of ships from the periodic motion inherent to all maritime objects and can be used to distinguish objects of interest for Homeland Security. There is a need for real-time classification of these objects. This work extends the state of the art in two ways: One - current maritime classification focuses on satellite ISAR, creating latency for classification[1]; and Two - work with Homeland Security ISAR radar systems is focused on concealed weapon detection [2,3]. This work uses localized ISAR images from stationary radars to classify maritime objects. Since the aspect and cross-range scale factor are continually changing, ISAR images form distinct representations unique to each object under observation. These distinct representations are analogous to visual images in many ways. They have unique shapes and areas of strong return, much in the same way objects in passive images have unique sizes and colors. However, ISAR images are synthetic portrayals of scattered field data from active sensor RF sensors whereas visual images are observations of passive sensors. This distinction must be a considered as a design constraint in the classification system - each feature employed must be exhaustively examined regarding its physical counterpart. Within that constraint, ISAR synthetic imagery feature extraction techniques can leverage from previous work developed for passive sensors. This is especially the case of High Range Resolution (HRR) ISAR systems. After extraction from ISAR prototype images, a set of representative features will be used to train a support vector machine (SVM) classifier, a supervised learning model capable of pattern recognition.","marine radar,active sensor,Inverse synthetic aperture radar,image motion analysis,Marine vehicles,Feature extraction,image colour analysis,supervised learning model,Target recognition,periodic motion,ships,radar computing,marine engineering,support vector machines,2D ship images,object detection,automated target recognition,synthetic aperture radar,feature extraction,image classification,maritime automated target recognition algorithm test bed,high range resolution ISAR imagery,RF sensors,Classification algorithms,SVM,homeland security ISAR radar systems,radar imaging,support vector machine classifier,Doppler effect,high resolution,Image segmentation,concealed weapon detection,weapons,satellite ISAR system,aim-point recognition,inverse synthetic aperture radar systems,stationary radars,Image resolution,national security,maritime object classification,image sensors,ship classification,learning (artificial intelligence),pattern recognition,passive sensors,object recognition,oceanographic techniques,"

"ship radial size estimation in high-resolution maritime surveillance radars via sparse recovery using linear programming","2019","For high-resolution maritime surveillance radars operating at scan mode and transmitting long duration pulses, radial size estimation of ships is severely interfered by range sidelobe effect of pulse compression. Due to range sidelobe effect, strong ship returns often cover a range interval wider than its radial size and the range interval covered by detected ship returns is sometimes a severe overestimate of its radial size. An approach to mitigate severe overestimation of ship radial sizes is to find the borders of high-resolution range profile (HRRP) of a ship. Therefore, ship radial size estimation boils down to the recovery of sparse HRRPs of ships from radar returns with heavy-tailed sea clutter in a coherent processing interval (CPI) only containing several pulses. In this paper, a sparse recovery method using linear programming (LP) is proposed to recover sparse HRRPs of ships from radar returns with heavy-tailed sea clutter. As a minor contribution, a full scheme is presented for ship radial size estimation in high-resolution surveillance radars operating at scan mode, which consists of coherent detection along with range cells, annotation of the range interval covered by ship returns, the decision of severe range sidelobe effect, recovery of sparse HRRPs of ships, and radial size computation. The performance of the proposed LP-based method to estimate ship radial size is evaluated by using simulated and real radar data.

The method weights various factors using a weight matrix built up from a distance difference matrix between different track points and calculations of the distance information entropy and residual degree using information entropy theory. We tested the proposed weighted track fusion algorithm the fusion accuracy using actual data for 2813 ships, AIS, and radar track points based on local information entropy. The resulting correlation accuracy was 95.54% for 2716 ship track points and a correlation accuracy of 90.72% for 97 ship tracks. The results indicate that the proposed algorithm is suitable for fusing multiple tracks and is more robust than traditional fusion methods.","Intelligent supervision,Abnormal behavior,Radar,AIS,"
"airborne maritime surveillance using magnetic anomaly detection signature","2020","For an airborne sensor, there is a pressing need to be able to detect/track submerged submarines, shipwrecks, sea mines, unexploded explosive ordnance, and buried drums during maritime surveillance. Traditional usage is the magnetic anomaly detection (MAD), where the small changes in the earth's magnetic field caused by the ferrous components of the targets are measured. The primary means of long-range detection and classification of targets are with passive and active acoustic sensors, and MAD is used for accurate final localization. MAD could also be used for land-based targets but this is not common. Knowing the relationship between the magnetic signature and the kinematic parameters, the tracking problem can be formulated under a Bayesian framework. In this article, multiple nonlinear filters are used for a real single surface-target tracking problem in maritime surveillance using an airborne total-field sensor. The posterior CramÃ©r-Rao lower bound for MAD is derived.

The predictors, including the Blue band/Violet band (BV), Green band/Violet band (GV), Yellow band/Violet band (YV), Green band (G), Yellow band (Y), and red-edge1 band (Re1), were derived via statistical analysis, as well as spectroscopy knowledge and experience. Compared with the conventional bathymetric method, such as single band algorithm (SBA), band ratio algorithm and support vector regression (SVR), the two regression trees used in this study yielded better accuracy. The R2, MAE and RMSE of the classification and regression tree (CART), the Cubist tree model were 0.74, 3.78 m and 5.35 m vs 0.78, 3.56 m and 4.88 m. Besides the improved accuracies, these tree-based models can effectively reveal water depth-associated environment types with the hierarchical relationships present in the visible spectral characteristics, which supports spatial zoning strategies for coastal critical zone management based on the Gaofen-6 imagery.","Bathymetry,Violet-related spectral ratio,Regression trees,SVR,Gaofen-6 satellite,Critical coastal zone management,"
"assessment of offshore oil/gas platform status in the northern gulf of mexico using multi-source satellite time-series images","2018","Accurate knowledge of the detailed status (location and lifetime) of each oil/gas platform is crucial for ocean management and for understanding its potential environmental impact. However, this requirement is often compromised due to incomplete data records, especially when platform abandonment is not properly planned, designed, and/or executed. The availability of multi-source optical and SAR images provides the possibility of a systematic assessment, but the ubiquitous false positives and frequent geocoding errors make it technically challenging. Here, we develop a time-series remote sensing approach (TSRS) for detecting offshore platforms and determining their status, where the technical challenges are overcome using two strategies, as follows: (i) A stepwise optimization strategy applied to individual images and time-series images to mitigate numerous noises, to select platforms from candidates, and to assess platform status; and (ii) A cross geo-correction strategy using platforms derived from high-geometric accuracy images as ground control points to rectify poorly geo-referenced images. We applied the TSRS approach to the northern Gulf of Mexico using about 26,000 moderate-resolution optical/SAR images from eight satellites spanning the period from 1982 to 2017. TSRS detected a total of 9260 (5556) platforms in both Federal and State waters, including 3140 (1803) existing platforms, 5044 (3426) removed platforms, and 1076 (327) status-to-be-determined platforms where the numbers in parentheses represent those from Federal waters. Of these TSRS platforms, 4751 coincide spatially with 5476 (77.68%) of platform records of the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) platform database; 2846 (387 in Federal waters) are not found in the BSEE platform database but are convincingly supported by data from other sources (including BSEE-pipeline-database, time-series VIIRS nighttime light products, and littoral ground-truth images), meaning that 82.04% of the TSRS-derived platforms can be directly/indirectly confirmed. A site-specific validation in East Bay using multi-temporal ground-truth aerial images indicates that, for this site, the false negative rate (FNR) is ~9.63% and the false positive rate (FPR) is only 4.44%. The detailed beginning/end dates of the TSRS platforms are mostly confirmed by the corresponding Installation/Site-clear dates recorded in the BSEE platform database. Our findings suggest that the TSRS approach is a robust and cost-effective way to assess oil/gas platform status in large regions, and our results here may complement the official database, narrow down locations for future field investigations, and provide critical information for future assessment of the potential impacts of active and decommissioned platforms on the marine environments.","Landsat,Northern Gulf of Mexico,Offshore platform,Platform status assessment,Remote sensing,SAR,Time-series,"

"integrated x band active phased array radar for maritime surveillance","2021","Airborne maritime surveillance plays an important role in safeguarding the coastline and exclusive economic zones. A multi-functional Maritime Patrol Radar (MPR), which can provide 360 degree azimuth coverage and operate in various modes like sea surface surveillance, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), Inverse SAR (ISAR), Search-and-Rescue, Weather etc., is crucial for providing an effective maritime situational awareness.

To tackle this problem, we make use of the multichannel coherent single data set algorithm which removes the need for any training data, thus alleviating the problem of clutter heterogeneity.

"dynamic detection of water surface area of ebinur lake using multi-source satellite data (landsat and sentinel-1a) and its responses to changing environment","2019","In arid and semi-arid climatic areas, lakes are extremely essential for fragile ecological environment and regional sustainable development. Ebinur Lake is an important component of the ecological barrier of Junggar Basin, Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR), China. Due to the tremendous changes in Ebinur Lake and surrounding marshes during the last decades, Ebinur Lake becomes a representative ecological degradation region in northwestern China. The detection of the intra-annual variations of water body and its responses to changing environment are critical for regional ecological security and rehabilitation of degraded ecosystem. To extract more accurate water information using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data and further fill the gap of inter-month dynamic monitoring of Ebinur Lake, a new SAR water index (modified Sentinel 1A water index, MSWI) was proposed based on the relationship between normalized difference water index (NDWI) imageries and Sentinel 1A data. The dynamic thresholds of classification were selected using Otsu method and the results showed that the classification results were acceptable with the optimal overall accuracy of 99.94% and kappa coefficient of 0.9971, respectively. We conduct a time series analysis of surface areas of Ebinur Lake using S1A data from February 9th, 2017 to February 4th, 2018. The maximum lake surface area was 965.29 km2 in April 22nd, 2017, while the minimum value was 750.37 km2 in September 1st, 2017, and the mean area was 831.51 km2. The seasonal variations showed the stages of “sharp rising” – “significant decreasing” – “gradual stabilizing” in the study period. The water surface area was highly correlated with inflow water volume (correlation coefficient = 0.72, P < 0.001). The variation of Ebinur Lake's water surface area is crucial to monitor the resulting eco-environmental impacts under the changing environmental conditions in the arid and semi-arid areas.","Ebinur Lake,Water index,Sentienel-1A,Remote sensing,Eco-environmental impact,"

Tracking and monitoring from the coast all type of ship on a common operational picture is no more sufficient. An Innovative solution shall be set up to support human operators in their permanent surveillance tasks in vulnerable trading lanes and zones in order to detect abnormal or illicit vessel behaviour and to understand and to early identify threatening situations. Displaying thousands of tracks on a single display has be demonstrated its inefficiency, in front of all the cases of illegal immigration, terrorism, drugs trafficking, smuggling, illegal fishing, pollution, etc... that were recorded this year. This future generation of maritime surveillance system must allow: 1) Permanent and all weather coverage of border maritime areas. 2) Continuous collection and fusion of heterogeneous data provided by various types of sensors deployed on coast and on mobile platforms and other information from external sources. 3) Supervised automatic detection of abnormal vessel behaviours (in track and performed activity) and generate justified alarms. 4) Understanding of suspicious events and early identification of threats from series of detected spatiotemporal abnormal vessel behaviours (alarms). 5) Generate electronic and formatted interpretation reports on the suspicious event to keep periodically informed decisional authorities. 6) Anticipate the operational response mobilizing and using means with the best efficiency as possible 7) To capitalize knowledge and work of each partner, within an inter-agencies and international framework, for a common benefit on a real time basis 8) To ensure the data protection respecting the respective rules of information sharing.

"clutter suppression and target tracking by the low-rank representation for airborne maritime surveillance radar","2020","Moving target detection is of vital importance to maritime security and maritime resource protection. However, the detection of slow or weak targets is difficult based on traditional methods. A new detection method is proposed by using the different motion variations of radar moving target and sea clutter in the range-Doppler spectrum sequence. The first step in implementing this method is the separation of moving target and sea clutter by the low-rank representation, in which the target and clutter are modeled as foreground and background components. Subsequently, a sea clutter discriminator is constructed within the sea clutter bandwidth to further remove the sea clutter (false alarms) that exists in the foreground. The proposed method can reduce the sea clutter power while maintaining the target power and improve the detection rate of moving targets, especially slow or weak targets. Data collected with airborne maritime surveillance radar in maritime moving target indication (MMTI) mode are used to validate the performance of the proposed method. The experimental results demonstrate that the improvement in the signal-to-clutter ratio (SCR) obtained with the proposed method is better than that obtained with space-time adaptive processing (STAP, including 1DT-STAP, 3DT-STAP and sparse-STAP) and principal component pursuit (PCP) methods; additionally, the figure of merit (FOM) of the proposed method is higher than that of the constant false alarm rate (CFAR) and PCP method.

"maritime surveillance using multiple high-frequency surface-wave radars","2014","In the last decades, great interest has been directed toward low-power high-frequency (HF) surface-wave radars as long-range early warning tools in maritime-situational-awareness applications. These sensors, developed for ocean remote sensing, provide an additional source of information for ship detection and tracking, by virtue of their over-the-horizon coverage capability and continuous-time mode of operation. Unfortunately, they exhibit many shortcomings that need to be taken into account, such as poor range and azimuth resolution, high nonlinearity, and significant presence of clutter. In this paper, radar detection, multitarget tracking, and data fusion (DF) techniques are applied to experimental data collected during an HF-radar experiment, which took place between May and December 2009 on the Ligurian coast of the Mediterranean Sea. The system performance is defined in terms of time on target (ToT), false alarm rate (FAR), track fragmentation, and accuracy. A full statistical characterization is provided using one month of data.

"an adaptive ionosphere clutter suppression and target detection method for hfswr maritime surveillance","2023","High-frequency surface wave radar (HFSWR) as a maritime surveillance facility faces the tough challenges. One of them is that various unwanted echo components constantly destroy the detection performance of HFSWR, especially the dynamically changing ionosphere clutter. This article proposes an adaptive ionosphere clutter suppression and target detection algorithm (AICSTD) based on improved higher order singular value decomposition (HOSVD) and deep learning network. First, we analyze the multiple-dimensional characteristics of different types of ionosphere clutter echo data. Then, refer to the multichannel HFSWR echo data structure, we apply simplified HOSVD and orthogonal subspace projection to eliminate the unwanted echo component and, meanwhile, preserve the target echo. The key parameter of simplified HOSVD is determined by the mean structural similarity (MSSIM) index, which contributes to reduce the computation complexity of the proposed method. Finally, we improved the deep learning network to detect the targets in various behaviors after the clutter suppression. In order to address the issue of limited clutter data, transfer learning based on historical radar echo data is applied. A thorough experimental analysis on various real clutter data shows that the proposed method performs competitively. Our method shows a superior performance over many state-of-the-art clutter suppression methods, with a covered target detection accuracy of 92.4% under strong spread clutter background.","Ionosphere,structural similarity (SSIM) index,higher order singular value decomposition (HOSVD),ionosphere clutter suppression,Tensors,Clutter,Deep learning,Object detection,Doppler effect,target detection,high-frequency surface wave radar (HFSWR),Reflection,"
"increasing quality of maritime communication through intelligent speech recognition and radio direction finding","2020","In the area of maritime rescue, the factor time in the event of an accident and the associated conduct of rescue operations is of fundamental importance. A difference in the arrival of the rescue forces from a few minutes can decide in the worst case between death or complete recovery of an injured person. First, this paper briefly addresses peculiarities of ship accidents and examines in particular communication-enhancing measures to avoid them. In this context, current developments in the field of automatic speech recognition by artificial intelligence are presented on the basis of the research project ARTUS - Automated Transcription of Maritime VHF Radio Communication for SAR Mission Coordination.

"comparing cnn-based object detectors on two novel maritime datasets","2020","Vessel detection studies conducted on inshore and offshore maritime images are scarce, due to a limited availability of domain-specific datasets. We addressed this need collecting two datasets in the Finnish Archipelago. They consist of images of maritime vessels engaged in various operating scenarios, climatic conditions and lighting environments. Vessel instances were precisely annotated in both datasets. We evaluated the out-of-the-box performance of three state-of-the-art CNN-based object detection algorithms (Faster R-CNN [1], R-FCN [2] and SSD [3]) on these datasets and compared them in terms of accuracy and run-time. The algorithms were previously trained on the COCO dataset [4]. We explore their performance based on different feature extractors. Furthermore, we investigate the effect of the object size on the algorithm performance. For this purpose, we group all objects in each image into three categories (small, medium and large) according to the number of occupied pixels in the annotated bounding box. Experiments show that Faster R-CNN with ResNet101 as feature extractor outperforms the other algorithms.","autonomous marine navigation,Lighting,CNN-based object detectors,maritime vessels,Feature extraction,climatic conditions,lighting environments,Transfer learning,domain-specific datasets,deep learning,faster R-CNN,bounding box annotation,marine engineering,object detection,feature extraction,offshore maritime images,Finnish Archipelago,Radar tracking,vessel detection,convolutional neural network,inshore maritime images,convolutional neural nets,maritime vessel dataset,Object detection,learning (artificial intelligence),COCO dataset,Detectors,Radar detection,"
"maritime moving target localization using passive gnss-based multistatic radar","2018","This paper examines the potential in extracting the instantaneous location of maritime moving targets using a passive multistatic radar with Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) as illuminators of opportunity and a single receiver. This paper presents a theoretical framework for the localization of a moving target from a set of bistatic range measurements. The algorithm and its predicted accuracy are presented. The localization is achieved by what is essentially a multilateration technique, which can be applied while the transmitting platform is also in motion. The algorithms and the accuracy predictions, as a function of the number of transmitters, have been experimentally confirmed via a dedicated experimental campaign, where two different maritime targets were detected by up to 12 GNSS satellites belonging to different satellite constellations (GPS, GLONASS, and Galileo) simultaneously. To the best of the author's knowledge, these are the first results of their kind and on this scale not only for GNSS-based passive radar but also for multistatic radar in general.","Satellites,multistatic radar,Passive radar,passive multistatic radar,multilateration technique,passive GNSS-based multistatic radar,Receivers,bistatic range measurements,Multistatic radar,target tracking,Spaceborne radar,Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)-based radar,maritime moving target localization,passive radar,Global Navigation Satellite Systems,satellite navigation,target localization,Global navigation satellite system,"
"a maritime target detector based on cnn and embedded device for gf-3 images","2019","Recently, with the development of deep learning and the springing up of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, SAR maritime target detection based on convolutional neural network (CNN) has become a hot issue. However, most related work is realized on general purpose hardware like CPU or GPU, which is energy consuming, non-real-time and unable to be deployed on embedded devices. Aiming at this problem, this paper proposes a method to deploy a model of SAR maritime target detection network on an embedded device which employs custom artificial intelligence streaming architecture (CAISA). Moreover, the model is trained and tested on the Gaofen-3 (GF-3) spaceborne SAR images, which include six different kinds of maritime targets.

"unambiguous imaging for moving targets in maritime scenarios with dual receive channel mode of gf-3 satellite","2019","Gaofen-3 (GF-3) is the first Chinese multichannel synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensor that can operate in the dual receive channel (DRC) mode. Different from the traditional single-channel SAR system, the multichannel SAR system can overcome the inherent limitation to achieve high-resolution and wide-swath (HRWS) at the same time. However, the key challenge it faces is false target suppression. Especially for the moving vessels on the ocean, the existence of false targets will increase false alarm probability and affect the interpretation of SAR images. In this paper, the method of integration of detection, velocity estimation, location, and imaging for moving targets in the HRWS SAR system is proposed as well as applied to get an unambiguous image.

"comparison of sparse signal separation algorithms for maritime radar target detection","2018","Due to the non-stationary nature of sea clutter, traditional maritime radar detection schemes utilise non-coherent processing. To further enhance the detection performance, one alternative is to use sparse signal separation. This is an alternative paradigm, whereby the different spatio-temporal characteristics of the radar signal are exploited to separate targets from the background interference. In previous work, the sparse signal separation problem has been posed in a compressive sensing framework so as to improve detection of small maritime targets. This paper investigates the performance of three different algorithms for solving the signal separation problem. These include the Split Augmented Lagrangian Shrinkage Algorithm (SALSA), adaptive Complex Approximate Message Passing (CAMP) and the Fast Sparse Functional Iteration Algorithm (FSFIA). The first contribution is to reformulate the CAMP algorithm to the framework of sparse signal separation. The suitability of each algorithm is then assessed using real data from the Ingara radar, and is based on the quality of the solutions obtained, the computational speed and the robustness to the user's choice of `tuning' parameters.","detection,marine radar,CAMP algorithm,signal denoising,radar detection,radar clutter,Ingara radar,sparse signal separation problem,alternative paradigm,noncoherent processing,target tracking,spatio-temporal characteristics,separate targets,object detection,compressed sensing,Sea clutter,Sparse signal separation algorithms,radar signal,message passing,detection performance,nonstationary nature,radar signal processing,iterative methods,radar tracking,source separation,Split Augmented Lagrangian Shrinkage Algorithm,maritime radar target detection,Fast Sparse Functional Iteration Algorithm,sparse signal processing,"
"enhancing automatic maritime surveillance systems with visual information","2017","Automatic surveillance systems for the maritime domain are becoming more and more important due to a constant increase of naval traffic and to the simultaneous reduction of crews on decks. However, available technology still provides only a limited support to this kind of applications. In this paper, a modular system for intelligent maritime surveillance, capable of fusing information from heterogeneous sources, is described. The system is designed to enhance the functions of the existing vessel traffic services systems and to be deployable in populated areas, where radar-based systems cannot be used due to the high electromagnetic radiation emissions.

Then, transfer the pre-training parameters of feature exaction layer to an end-to-end model.

"requirement on antenna cross-polarization isolation for the operational use of c-band sar constellations in maritime surveillance","2010","The issue of antenna cross-polarization isolation has been previously discussed for the design of fully polarimetric synthetic aperture radars (SARs). Dual-polarized antennas with cross-polarization isolation that is better than -30 dB are desirable for more convenient polarimetric data calibration since measurements of antenna crosstalk (magnitude and phase) variations with incidence angle are not required. For an antenna with significant polarization crosstalk, it is still possible to retrieve pure polarization measurements of HH, HV, VH, and VV provided that the four corresponding received voltages are measured. However, it is not possible to recover from cross-polarization contamination for single- or dual-polarization measurements. Therefore, it is important to set up a minimum requirement on dual-polarized antenna isolation so that single- and dual-polarization applications are not unduly affected. In this letter, the minimum requirement on cross-polarization antenna isolation is investigated for operational use of C-band SARs in maritime surveillance applications. Calibrated polarimetric RADARSAT-2 data are used to simulate single- and dual-polarization data with cross-polarization contamination for a dual-polarized antenna with cross-polarization isolation ranging from -20 to -35 dB. It is shown that the cross-polarization HV (or VH) channel can be significantly affected, particularly at steep incidence angles. As a result, key applications that require the use of pure HV, such as ship detection and wind-speed measurements, are significantly affected. A requirement for a minimum of -30-dB antenna isolation is established. Antennas with cross-polarization isolation better than -35 dB are desirable for reliable exploitation of HV data at steep incidence angles.","multipolarization,antenna crosstalk,ship detection,Antenna measurements,Aperture antennas,antenna cross-polarization isolation,Pollution measurement,wind-speed measurement,synthetic aperture radar (SAR) polarimetry,C-band SAR constellations,Antenna,Contamination,maritime surveillance,dual-polarized antennas,synthetic aperture radar,polarization crosstalk,search radar,Phase measurement,polarimetric synthetic aperture radars,Crosstalk,Polarization,Calibration,dual polarization,calibration,radar polarimetry,Polarimetric synthetic aperture radar,Surveillance,crosstalk,RADARSAT-2,"
"reduced rank hybrid target detectors for maritime environments","2022","In airborne radar, reduced rank adaptive techniques are employed when non-stationarity and non-homogeneity of the clutter causes insufficient sample support. Approaches to combat this problem include the single data set algorithms and reduced-rank detectors such as those employing the principal components, cross-spectral metric and the multistage Wiener filter (MWF). This latter approach is superior to other reduced rank techniques in terms of computational efficiency, sample support and rank requirements. Hybrid detectors that combine the traditional and single data set detectors have been shown to work effectively in homogeneous environments while maintaining their robustness to heterogeneous clutter. In this paper we combine the hybrid detection approaches with the MWF to develop hybrid reduced rank algorithms that are capable of bringing the improved performance of the hybrid framework to bear on the low sample support environments. We evaluate the proposed detectors using simulated sea clutter data, showing detection performance that is superior to conventional and other hybrid detectors in low sample support spiky clutter environments while maintaining excellent performance in homogeneous clutter.","airborne radar,marine radar,reduced rank techniques,single data,radar detection,radar clutter,hybrid detectors,homogeneous clutter,sea clutter data,MWF,low sample support environments,hybrid reduced rank algorithms,multistage Wiener filter,heterogeneous clutter,reduced-rank detectors,homogeneous environments,maritime environments,rank requirements,hybrid detection approaches,reduced rank hybrid target detectors,low sample support spiky clutter environments,reduced rank adaptive techniques,Wiener filters,"

"doppler estimation for dvb-t based passive radar systems on moving maritime platforms","2015","PR (Passive Radar) systems using digital broadcasting services such as DVB-T (Digital Versatile Broadcasting - Terrestrial) transmission as illuminators represent surveillance solutions which have rapidly evolved and matured over recent years. PR systems typically use coherent integration time in the order of a few hundred milliseconds to acquire enough dynamic for the detection of moving objects. This is done under the assumption that both the illuminator of opportunity and the receiver stay static during this time period. However, advances in miniaturization of high performing computers and data storage devices allowed the design of PR systems that are compact enough to be operated onboard of moving platforms such as cars [1] and airplanes [2], [3]. Deploying PR systems on maritime platforms could enable covert surveillance of small land or sea based targets in littoral environment. A receiver mounted on such a platform may be subjected to highly non-linear motions. In this case a reference signal generated under the assumption of a static scenario may de-correlate from measured Doppler shifted surveillance channel and consequently degrade the PR systems detection performance. Compensation of these detrimental effects requires highly sampled and accurate measurements of the vessels Doppler shift with respect to the transmitter. To study these effects a two channel PR system for DVB-T broadcast reception has been deployed on a small boat to acquire platform motion data in a littoral environment. Based on the data gathered in this trial, a robust method for the Doppler estimation was developed, which uses the DVB-T standards OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing) signal features.

"ais-based maritime anomaly traffic detection: a review","2023","Maritime transportation plays an essential role in global trade. Due to the huge number of vessels worldwide, there is also a non-negligible volume of Maritime incidents such as collisions/sinking and illegal events (e.g., piracy, smuggling, and unauthorized fishing). Electronic equipment/systems, such as radars and Automatic Identification Systems (AIS), have contributed to improving maritime situational awareness. AIS provides one of the fundamental sources of vessel kinematics and static data. Today, many approaches are focused on automatically detecting the vessels’ traffic behavior and discovering useful patterns and deviations from those data. These studies contribute to detecting suspicious activities and anomalous trajectories, whose developed techniques could be applied in the surveillance systems, helping the authorities to anticipate proper actions. Several concerns and difficulties are involved in the analyses of vessel kinematics data: how to deal with big data generated, inconsistencies, irregular updates, dynamic data, unlabeled data, and evaluation.

Multiple hypothesis testing suggests a framework to enlist reliable information from monitoring systems (coastal radars and space-born satellite sensors) in support of detection of anomalies, spoofing, and stealth deviations.

"results from 3 seasons of surveys in maritime canada using the leica chiroptera ii shallow water topo-bathymetric lidar sensor","2017","The coastal zone is a challenging place to map, techniques for mapping the land cover and elevation do not work under water and methods for mapping the seabed cover and elevation work well in deep water but are dangerous and expensive in shallow water. As a result, detailed information in the shallow coastal zone is lacking. This presentation will focus on the Chiroptera II, a new shallow water topo-bathymetric lidar sensor that is designed to collect seamless elevation data from land to the submerged terrain under coastal or freshwater. The sensor is equipped with a 1064 nm laser capable of a laser scanning frequency up to 500 kHz and a 515 nm green laser capable of a scanning frequency of 35 kHz. The lasers pulses are directed to the surface using a palmer scanner that results in an elliptical scan pattern with a 14 degree forward and back scan angle and a 20 degree left and right scan angle. The NIR laser is used to map details on the land and to assist in defining the water surface, which is critical in order to compensate for the 515 nm laser beam diffraction angle and the change of speed from air to water, thus accurately positioning the reflected seabed return. In addition to collecting the elevation at high resolution ~ 1m and vertical precision ~ 15 cm, the intensity of the reflected green laser also provides insights into what is on the seabed. A 60 MPIX RCD30 camera capable of capturing NIR and RGB bands of imagery is co-aligned with the lidar sensor to provide additional data that can be directly georeferenced with a ca 5 cm resolution. Full waveforms of the green laser are recorded and used to calculate discrete points representing the water surface, objects in the water column and the seabed bathymetry. Standard point attributes include the x, y, z positioning, echo information and intensity or amplitude of the reflected signal. An empirical method has been developed to compensate for the exponential energy loss of the green laser energy with water depth. This method results in a â€œdepth normalizedâ€ seabed intensity image which provides details on the seabed cover materials. Tools have been built to calculate waveform metrics of the seabed return including: total area under the curve, skewness, kurtosis, the left and right distance and angle to the peak. These waveform metrics can then be used to construct grids representing the metrics which can be used for subsequent bottom cover classification. NSCC-AGRG has conducted topo-bathy lidar surveys throughout Maritime Canada for the past 3 years using this sensor. Since the sensor relies on the penetration of 515 nm light to detect the seabed, water clarity and the reflectivity of the seabed are constraints on the depth of penetration of the lidar. Coastal waters have variable turbidity, often dominated by wind induced wave action that suspends near shore sediments causing poor survey conditions. A turbidity management system has been designed that relies on meteorological forecasts and observed wind conditions as well as shoreline orientation along the coast to predict suitable periods for bathymetric lidar surveys. The turbidity management system will be presented as well as the results of several surveys. Various applications of these data will be presented including mapping submerged aquatic vegetation, providing input to hydrodynamic model simulations to support aquaculture site selection and improve oil spill preparedness, and shoreline sensitivity mapping. In areas of repeat surveys, the sensor has demonstrated the capability of mapping subtle changes in the dynamic near shore environment.","seagrass,wavelength 1064.0 nm,aquaculture site selection,wavelength 515.0 nm,near shore sediments,turbidity management system,Surface waves,water clarity,Sea measurements,shoreline sensitivity mapping,Leica Chiroptera II shallow water topobathymetric lidar sensor,Laser radar,geophysical image processing,Surface emitting lasers,seabed cover materials,topo-bathymetric lidar,frequency 500.0 kHz,water column,NSCC-AGRG,circulation model,laser scanning frequency,remote sensing by laser beam,land cover,green laser energy,laser beam diffraction angle,coastal waters,oil spill preparedness,map details,optical radar,bathymetry,aquatic vegetation mapping,freshwater,near shore environment,bottom mapping,vegetation,NIR laser,MPIX RCD30 camera,maritime Canada,bathymetric lidar surveys,depth normalized seabed intensity image,bottom reflectance,frequency 35.0 kHz,shallow coastal zone,lasers pulses,Vegetation mapping,palmer scanner,sediments,aquaculture,Reflectivity,"

"trajectory optimization for high-altitude long-endurance uav maritime radar surveillance","2020","For an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) carrying out a maritime radar surveillance mission, there is a tradeoff between maximizing information obtained from the search area and minimizing fuel consumption. This article presents an approach for the optimization of a UAV's trajectory for maritime radar wide area persistent surveillance to simultaneously minimize fuel consumption, maximize mean probability of detection, and minimize mean revisit time. Quintic polynomials are used to generate UAV trajectories due to their ability to provide complete and complex solutions while requiring few inputs. Furthermore, the UAV dynamics and surveillance mission requirements are used to ensure that a trajectory is realistic and mission compatible. A wide area search radar model is used within this article in conjunction with a discretized grid in order to determine the search area's mean probability of detection and mean revisit time. The trajectory generation method is then used in conjunction with a multiobjective particle swarm optimization algorithm to obtain a global optimum in terms of path, airspeed (and thus time), and altitude. The performance of the approach is then tested over two common maritime surveillance scenarios and compared to an industry recommended baseline.","surveillance,remote sensing,trajectory optimisation (aerospace),multiobjective optimization,Trajectory optimization,particle swarm optimisation,trajectory generation method,unmanned aerial vehicle,polynomials,aircraft control,robot dynamics,UAV dynamics,search radar,particle swarm optimization (PSO),Radar,high-altitude long-endurance UAV maritime radar surveillance,path planning,autonomous aerial vehicles,quintic polynomials,Airborne radar,trajectory optimization,Unmanned aerial vehicles,mobile robots,wide area search radar model,Surveillance,unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs),robot kinematics,Fuels,multiobjective particle swarm optimization algorithm,"
"saliency-based detection for maritime object tracking","2016","This paper presents a new method for object detection and tracking based on visual saliency as a way of mitigating against challenges present in maritime environments. Object detection is based on adaptive hysteresis thresholding of a saliency map generated with a modified version of the Boolean Map Saliency (BMS) approach. We show that the modification reduces false positives by suppressing detection of wakes and surface glint. Tracking is performed by matching detections frame to frame and smoothing trajectories with a Kalman filter.

"joint registration and fusion of an infrared camera and scanning radar in a maritime context","2020","The number of nodes in sensor networks is continually increasing, and maintaining accurate track estimates inside their common surveillance region is a critical necessity. Modern sensor platforms are likely to carry a range of different sensor modalities, all providing data at differing rates, and with varying degrees of uncertainty. These factors complicate the fusion problem as multiple observation models are required, along with a dynamic prediction model. However, the problem is exacerbated when sensors are not registered correctly with respect to each other, i.e., if they are subject to a static or dynamic bias. In this case, measurements from different sensors may correspond to the same target, but do not correlate with each other when in the same Frame of Reference (FoR), which decreases track accuracy. This paper presents a method to jointly estimate the state of multiple targets in a surveillance region, and to correctly register a radar and an Infrared Search and Track (IRST) system onto the same FoR to perform sensor fusion. Previous work using this type of parent-offspring process has been successful when calibrating a pair of cameras, but has never been attempted on a heterogeneous sensor network, or in a maritime environment.

"spaceborne radar imaging of maritime moving targets with the cosmo-skymed sar system","2014","Advanced satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems, such as Cosmo-SkyMed (CSK), provide high-resolution images with reasonably short revisiting time, allowing for a number of applications in areas such as homeland security and maritime surveillance. Especially in the case of maritime surveillance, moving targets imaging represents a challenge for SAR systems as the complex target motions produce evident image defocusing. In this paper, we propose a complete processing chain that aims at detecting and imaging ship targets moving inside the imaged scene. In the proposed technique, moving targets are focused by using inverse SAR (ISAR) processing, which proves effective also in the case of target's complex motions. The implemented processing chain can be considered an innovative combination of well-established detection and ISAR imaging approaches. It is important to state that the proposed maritime ISAR mode for the CSK SAR system acts as an add-on system and, therefore, does not require any modification to the original CSK design. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated by processing archive images acquired by CSK in spotlight mode; moreover results obtained by using CSK images acquired ad hoc against a cooperative target are also provided in order to prove the validity of the overall chain also in presence of targets with small size. As additional option of the proposed maritime ISAR it will also be shown that super-resolution techniques are applicable to targets affected by complex motions after ISAR processing is used.","spaceborne radar imaging,Marine vehicles,Inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR),Cosmo-SkyMed SAR System,Synthetic aperture radar,geophysical image processing,add-on system,Program processors,object detection,synthetic aperture radar,synthetic aperture radar (SAR),superresolution techniques,radar imaging,Image segmentation,Radar imaging,spaceborne radar,Imaging,Spaceborne radar,inverse SAR processing,remote sensing by radar,maritime moving targets,"
"changes in maritime traffic patterns according to installation of floating lidar using spatial analysis","2023","Recently, with the development of marine space around the world, friction between maritime traffic and various marine activities is intensifying. In particular, different recommendations are being made for the buffer zone between offshore wind farms and maritime traffic, as the criteria vary significantly. In order to respond to these changes in marine space, conducted this study on the change of maritime traffic patterns before and after the installation of floating LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) in marine facilities and apply it to future changes in maritime traffic patterns. The maritime traffic data was based on Automatic Identification System (AIS) data, and it was targeted at cargo ships and tankers with regular traffic patterns. A trajectory and spatial analysis were performed based on the AIS in the marine space. As a result of analyzing the globally maritime traffic patterns targeting the location of the installation complex of LiDARs, it can be confirmed that the existing maritime traffic patterns change into three maritime traffic patterns. Furthermore, the study employed the Hausdorff-distance algorithm for clustering analysis, categorizing vessels with similar trajectories. This approach facilitated a locally analysis of the buffer zone associated with individual LiDAR, considering the length of the vessels. As a result, it was analyzed that each vessel navigated at different buffer zone depending on the size of the vessel, and it is possible for safe navigation and forecast the future maritime traffic patterns.","Traffic control,Maritime traffic,maritime traffic data,buffer zone,Marine vehicles,wind power plants,globally maritime traffic patterns,Laser radar,marine space,existing maritime traffic patterns change,ships,marine safety,marine engineering,Wind farms,marine facilities,Oceans,regular traffic patterns,pattern clustering,Artificial intelligence,offshore installations,optical radar,future maritime traffic patterns,telecommunication traffic,spatial analysis,automatic identification system (AIS),Analytical models,"
"high resolution isar imaging for maritime targets by encoder-decoder network combined with the time-frequency attention","2021","The Inverse Synthetic Aperture Radar (ISAR) imaging result of a rotating maritime target is usually defoculsing since the complex sea conditions may cause time-varying spin speed of targets. A common solution is to utilize range instantaneous Doppler (RID) algorithm for short time imaging, however, the RID algorithm suffers from the low time-frequency resolution. Therefore, this paper proposes an Encoder-Decoder neural net-work combined with Time-Frequency Attention (TFA) module to enhance instantaneous frequency resolution. The TFA module is utilized to extract the spectral lines of weak scatterers, further, the Encoder-Decoder network is designed to transform the low-resolution time-frequency refined by the TFA module to their high-resolution counterparts.

Thus the anisotropy of the wood should be taken into account when the ground-penetrating radar (GPR) technique is used to explore the properties of timber. The work carried out analyzes, by means of a GPR with a 1.6 GHz antenna, the dielectric behavior of Maritime Pine timber according to the direction of the electrical field with respect to the grain. After the acquisition process, the propagation velocities, amplitudes, and spectra variations were compared for all the studied grain directions.

"self-adaptive dynamic obstacle avoidance and path planning for usv under complex maritime environment","2019","The unmanned surface vehicle (USV) is usually required to perform some tasks with the help of static and dynamic environmental information obtained from different detective systems such as shipborne radar, electronic chart, and AIS system. The essential requirement for USV is safe when suffered an emergency during the task. However, it has been proved to be difficult as maritime traffic is becoming more and more complex. Consequently, path planning and collision avoidance of USV has become a hot research topic in recent year. This paper focuses on dynamic obstacle avoidance and path planning problem of USV based on the Ant Colony Algorithm (ACA) and the Clustering Algorithm (CA) to construct an auto-obstacle avoidance method which is suitable for the complicated maritime environment. In the improved ant colony-clustering algorithm proposed here, a suitable searching range is chosen automatically by using the clustering algorithm matched to different environmental complexities, which can make full use of the limited computing resources of the USV and improve the path planning performances firstly. Second, the dynamic searching path is regulated and smoothed by the maneuvering rules of USV and the smoothing mechanism respectively, which can effectively reduce the path length and the cumulative turning angle. Finally, a simulation example is provided to show that our proposed algorithm can find suitable searching range according to different obstacle distributions, as well as accomplish path planning with good self-adaptability. Therefore, a safe dynamic global path with better optimize performances is achieved with the help of multi-source information.","Path planning,path planning performances,static information,safe dynamic global path,auto-obstacle avoidance method,suitable searching range,path planning problem,remotely operated vehicles,adaptive searching range,ant colony optimisation,Marine vehicles,smoothing mechanism,control engineering computing,Planning,detective systems,ant colony algorithm,dynamic path planning,Collision avoidance,pattern clustering,Artificial intelligence,dynamic searching path,Ant colony-clustering algorithm,path length,complicated maritime environment,path planning,environmental complexities,search problems,obstacle distributions,dynamic environmental information,complex maritime environment,mobile robots,improved ant colony-clustering algorithm,Sensors,electronic chart,marine vehicles,collision avoidance,USV,Heuristic algorithms,dynamic obstacle avoidance,"

"anomaly based sea-surface small target detection using k-nearest neighbor classification","2020","Sea-surface small target detection is always a difficult problem in high-resolution maritime ubiquitous radars for complex characteristics of sea clutter, weak target returns, and diversity of targets. Multiple features extracted from radar returns in different domains have ability but not enough to solely distinguish radar returns with target from sea clutter. Joint exploitation of multiple features becomes the key to improve detection performance. In this article, the K-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm and anomaly detection idea are cooperated to develop a novel sea-surface target detection method in the feature space spanned by the eight existing salient features. The detection is realized by the anomaly detection followed by a specially designed KNN-based classifier with a controllable false alarm rate. In the anomaly detection, a decision region is determined by the hyper-spherical coverage of the training set of sea clutter that is sufficient and ergodic in the feature space. The KNN-based classifier is designed based on the training sample set of sea clutter and the training sample set of simulated target returns plus sea clutter that is sufficient but nonergodic, by joint usage of feature weighting, neighbor weighting, and distance weighting. The novel method is validated by the two open and recognized IPIX and CSIR radar databases for sea-surface small target detection. The results show that it provides significant performance improvement in comparison with the existing multiple-feature-based detection methods, owing to the fact that the novel method avoids the dimension restriction and feature compression loss in the existing methods.","k-nearest neighbor algorithm,feature compression loss,IPIX radar databases,marine radar,high-resolution maritime ubiquitous radars,Anomaly detection,radar detection,radar clutter,KNN-based classifier design,anomaly based sea-surface,neighbor algorithm,Feature extraction,sea clutter,radar computing,anomaly detection idea,object detection,feature extraction,CSIR radar databases,weak target return simulation,K-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier with controllable false alarm rate,Radar clutter,feature weighting space,nearest neighbour methods,Training,sea-surface small target detection,Clutter,sea-surface target detection method,Object detection,Anomaly detection framework,multiple-feature-based detection methods,training sample set,Radar detection,"
"iso-kinematic maps from statistical analysis of ps-insar data of piemonte, nw italy: comparison with geological kinematic trends","2011","SAR interferometry based on Permanent Scatterers (PS-InSAR™) is used here to study the present crustal mobility of a large area of NW Italy, in the Piemonte region. Thirty-eight satellite scenes (ERS SAR), taken from May 1992 to January 2001, were analysed for detecting more than 2million PS on the study area. Continuous velocity surface maps (Iso-Kinematic Maps: IKM) were obtained from geo-statistical and spatial cluster techniques (Hot Spot analysis) of PS “short-period” data, to identify relative ground motions and to compare them with “long-period” tectonic mobility trends, i.e. those inferred at regional scale over geological times (some million years). The comparison was made by individuation of homogeneous kinematic areas, represented in the IKM, and characterization of the boundaries between them (Iso-Kinematic Boundaries: IKB). The IKB were used as tools to asses if the PS-InSAR data on present-day crustal mobility could fit with the distribution of real tectonic structures or field geological elements. IKM were drawn for uplifting geological sectors of Piemonte (Maritime Alps, Gran Paradiso, Langhe) where moderate to very low seismicity is recorded, and gravitational instabilities of rock mass on mountain slopes are widespread. The land sectors have been chosen in order to test the suitability of IKM in very different geo-morphological conditions. Different types of correspondence between the IKM and the geological kinematic trend were found:-a first type in which the kinematic trend of short-period (a decade of years, i.e. the PS-InSAR detection time span) is in agreement with a long-period tectonic trend (some million years) and seem to be driven by well known faults subparallel to the IKB. These kinematic trends can be hidden by the slope movement due to gravitational instabilities;-a second type in which the kinematic trend of short-period does not strictly correspond to the long-period trend, but can be considered as minor-order, uplifting-subsidence cycles, even if in contrast with the long-period kinematic trend. Alternatively, the short-period kinematic trends could reflect the action of deep-seated geological forces or structures, not yet known or inferable (at least with the recorded PS-InSAR velocities) on the basis of the available geological data and models.",""

"influence of climate variability on anchovy reproductive timing off northern chile","2016","We investigated the relationship between environmental variables and the Gonadosomatic Monthly Mean (GMM) index of anchovy (Engraulis ringens) to understand how the environment affects the dynamics of anchovy reproductive timing. The data examined corresponds to biological information collected from samples of the landings off northern Chile (18°21′S, 24°00′S) during the period 1990–2010. We used the Humboldt Current Index (HCI) and the Multivariate ENSO Index (MEI), which combine several physical-oceanographic factors in the Tropical and South Pacific regions. Using the GMM index, we studied the dynamics of anchovy reproductive timing at different intervals of length, specifically females with a length between 11.5 and 14cm (medium class) and longer than 14cm (large class). Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Mobile Average (SARIMA) was used to predict missing observations. The trends of the environment and reproductive indexes were explored via the Breaks For Additive Season and Trend (BFAST) statistical technique and the relationship between these indexes via cross-correlation functions (CCF) analysis. Our results showed that the habitat of anchovy switched from cool to warm condition, which also influenced gonad development. This was revealed by two and three significant changes (breaks) in the trend of the HCI and MEI indexes, and two significant breaks in the GMM of each time series of anchovy females (medium and large). Negative cross-correlation between the MEI index and GMM of medium and large class females was found, indicating that as the environment gets warmer (positive value of MEI) a decrease in the reproductive activity of anchovy can be expected. Correlation between the MEI index and larger females was stronger than with medium females. Additionally, our results indicate that the GMM index of anchovy for both length classes reaches two maximums per year; the first from August to September and the second from December to January. The intensity (maximum GMM values at rise point) of reproductive activity was not equal though, with the August–September peak being the highest.

In this paper, the authors propose a new segmentation method that combines fuzzy and graph-based theories.

"intelligent edge-enabled efficient multi-source data fusion for autonomous surface vehicles in maritime internet of things","2022","With the rapid development of low-end Internet of Things (IoT) devices and shipborne sensors, efficient multi-source data fusion methods for autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) have recently attracted significant research interest in intelligent edge-enabled maritime applications. The data fusion capacity can enhance the situation awareness of ASVs, leading to improved efficacy and safety in ASV-empowered maritime IoT (MIoT). Both cameras and automatic identification system (AIS) equipment, which provide visual and positioning information, respectively, have become the commonly adopted cost-effective sensors. In this work, we first introduce a lightweight YOLOX-s network with transfer learning to accurately and robustly detect the moving vessels at different scales in real time. A data augmentation method is then proposed to promote its generalization ability. The detected vessels and synchronous AIS messages are finally fused to make full use of the multi-source sensing data, contributing to an augmented reality (AR)-based maritime navigation system at the shipborne intelligent edges. The AR system is able to superimpose both static and dynamic information from the collected AIS messages onto the video-captured images. It has the capacity of providing auxiliary information for early warning of navigation risks for ASVs in MIoT networks. Compared with traditional single-sensor-based navigation methods, our data fusion framework exhibits more reliable and robust results, and appears to have substantial practical potential applications. Extensive experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the superior performance of our framework under different navigational conditions.","collected AIS messages,shipborne intelligent edges,intelligent edge-enabled efficient multisource data fusion,intelligent edge-enabled maritime applications,augmented reality,deep neural network,sensor fusion,augmented reality-based maritime navigation system,Safety,multi-source data fusion,remotely operated vehicles,Internet of Things,Cameras,low-end Internet,detected vessels,improved efficacy,Laser radar,synchronous AIS messages,maritime Internet,Autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs),safety,data fusion capacity,multisource sensing data,data augmentation method,image fusion,marine safety,cameras,efficient multisource data fusion methods,edge computing,shipborne sensors,traditional single-sensor-based navigation methods,autonomous surface vehicles,Artificial intelligence,commonly adopted cost-effective sensors,Radar,data fusion framework exhibits,ASV-empowered maritime IoT,ASVs,Data integration,mobile robots,maritime Internet of Things (MIoT),navigation,learning (artificial intelligence),Intelligent sensors,Things devices,"
"efficient lidar-based object segmentation and mapping for maritime environments","2019","This paper proposes a method that utilizes a 3-D occupancy grid to efficiently map a large area while retaining simple representations of objects for path planning and provide spatial characteristics of objects, which may be used for object classification. To enable large-scale mapping of objects, a region around the unmanned surface vehicle (USV) is defined where a high density of LiDAR returns is expected, termed the visibility horizon. The polygon intersection between the visibility horizon and the newly detected objects is computed, as well as the polygon subtraction of the visibility horizon from the mapped list of polygons. The two polygon lists are then combined using a polygon union operation, with the objects retaining class designations. The result is a 2-D map that contains polygon representations of objects, where the object is described with a tunable number of vertices and may have an associated object class. Thus, providing necessary information for path planning and tasking. The resultant polygons are shown here to be accurate to 20 cm using a 10-cm occupancy grid and 16-ft-long unmanned surface vehicles with four multibeam LiDAR sensors.","Path planning,polygon union operation,object mapping,Global Positioning System,object segmentation,Laser radar,size 20.0 cm,polygon lists,oceanographic equipment,LiDAR,object spatial characteristics,remote sensing by laser beam,object detection,maritime environments,3-D occupancy grid,mapping,Sea surface,multibeam LiDAR sensors,optical radar,LiDAR returns,Object segmentation,path planning,Sensors,occupancy grid,associated object class,unmanned surface vehicle,image segmentation,object classification,polygon subtraction,polygon representations,polygon intersection,resultant polygons,"

"radar detection of low-altitude targets in a maritime environment","1995","Results from a unique analytical and experimental effort to assess low-altitude, short-range, radar detection capabilities in an evaporation ducting environment are presented. Within the horizon, the duct may shift the location of the last interference null several kilometers in range, which may cause nondetection at ranges where detection is expected and detection at ranges where detection is not expected. In addition, the evaporation duct may reduce the signal strength at ranges near the last interference peak so that detection of low-altitude, small-size, targets may not be possible until the target is much closer. At ranges near and beyond the horizon, radar signal strength depends both on the surface layer and on the mixed layer. To accurately model propagation in this region, knowledge of both surface layer and upper air meteorology Is required. An empirical model to merge the surface layer with the mixed layer has been developed. Comparisons of measured to calculated detection range indicate that the assumption of a standard atmosphere minimizes the variance of the difference between the detection ranges whereas ranges calculated using the measured surface meteorological conditions and a modified surface layer model minimizes the median of the difference.<>","evaporation,surface layer,propagation,Ducts,radar detection,surface meteorological conditions,atmospheric boundary layer,signal strength,low-altitude targets,SHF,9415 MHz,Sea measurements,military systems,Meteorology,Atmospheric modeling,tropospheric electromagnetic wave propagation,marine systems,X-band,microwave propagation,electromagnetic wave interference,Atmosphere,Oceans,atmospheric humidity,Sea surface,radar interference,Atmospheric measurements,radiofrequency interference,evaporation ducting environment,maritime environment,mixed layer,small-size targets,short-range radar detection,horizon,Interference,last interference null,Radar detection,"

Owing to the extensive body of literature available and the uncertainty surrounding the future trajectory of seaweed research under evolving climate conditions, this review scrutinizes the structure, dynamics, and progression of the literature pertaining to seaweed and climate change. This analysis is grounded in the Web of Science Core Collection database, augmented by CiteSpace software. Furthermore, we discuss the productivity and influence of individual researchers, research organizations, countries, and scientific journals. To date, there have been 8047 articles published globally (after a series of filters and exclusions), with a notable upswing in publication frequency since 2018. The USA, China, and Australia are among the leading countries contributing to this research area. Our findings reveal that current research on seaweed and climate change encompasses 13 distinct research clusters, including “marine heatwave”, “temperate estuary”, “ocean acidification”, and “macroalgal bloom”. The most frequently cited keywords are “climate change”, “biomass”, “community”, and “photosynthesis”. The seaweed species most commonly referenced in relation to climate change include Gracilaria sp., Sargassum sp., Ecklonia maxima, and Macrocystis pyrifera. These results provide valuable guidance for shaping the direction of specialized topics concerning marine biodiversity under shifting climate conditions.

"imitating radar operator decisions for maritime surveillance missions using bayesian networks","2019","This paper presents the use of Bayesian networks for learning decisions made by a human radar operator carrying out a maritime surveillance mission. By imitating the operator's decisions, a significant increase in the autonomy of a radar surveillance system can be achieved as well as potentially streamlining the qualification process. For maritime scenarios, current literature has only focused on using a Bayesian network (BN) for identification and assessment, and often assumes inputs from a generic surveillance sensor. Furthermore, in both the maritime surveillance and radar operations domain, there has been no investigation into using the operator's data in order to learn the decisions made throughout the mission. This paper uses a realtime radar simulation in order to obtain the scenario and radar information that would be observed by a human operator. In conjunction with a user interface, the simulation is further used to obtain operator decisions for a given mission with the maximum likelihood approach used to obtain the BN probabilities. The BN is then used in place of the operator for interfacing with the simulation in order to test the suitability of this method. Several typical scenarios are used to demonstrate the BN's operational ability relative to that of the operator.

"maritime moving target detection technique for passive bistatic radar with gnss transmitters","2017","The paper puts forward a moving target detection technique for passive bistatic radar systems based on GNSS signals for maritime surveillance applications. If from one hand navigation satellites are extremely attractive as opportunistic sources for passive radar due to their global coverage and the availability of multiple satellites, on the other hand they provide a restricted power budget. To strengthen the target energy sufficiently to allow its detection, observation time has to be increased up to several tens of seconds. This requires the need to develop innovative techniques able to deal with such long integration times. In this paper, a local plane-based maritime moving target detection (M-MTD) technique is proposed. Such a technique performs the integration of the received signal for a long integration time, properly taking into account the migration of the moving target during the entire dwell time. Moreover, it provides target detection in the local plane that represents the section of maritime area covered by the radar antenna. Since this plane is common to multiple transmitters, the proposed technique can be easily extended to the multistatic case, which is the bigger benefit in using GNSS sources.

"beam scheduling of maritime multifunctional radar based on binary integration","2023","This study developed a radar resource management (RRM) framework for maritime multifunctional radar (MFR) that performs surveillance and tracking of unknown targets. The proposed scheme consists of two stages: target prioritization based on fuzzy logic and a beam scheduling approach that transmits surveillance beam and tracking beams for each target appropriately. The proposed beam scheduling scheme also takes into account the imperfect detection of targets in real situation. A conventional heuristic beam scheduling approach was modified to incorporate binary integration in radar theory into the RRM strategy. The resulting scheme efficiently handles the complicated beam scheduling problem by considering the target priority as well as the imperfect detection of targets of a real maritime MFR. Simulation results based on a realistic maritime environment demonstrated that the proposed scheme not only determines the correct order of transmission beams according to the target priority but also maintains good tracking accuracy for the threatening target.","marine radar,Radar resource management,radar detection,tracking accuracy,heuristic beam scheduling approach,Neural networks,maritime MFR,radar resource management framework,fuzzy logic,telecommunication scheduling,RRM strategy,target tracking,beam scheduling,tracking beams,Target tracking,threatening target,object detection,search radar,Radar tracking,complicated beam scheduling problem,multifunctional radar,surveillance beam,Radar,RRM framework,radar tracking,target prioritization,realistic maritime environment,Surveillance,Task analysis,maritime multifunctional radar,binary integration,Radar detection,radar theory,"

Contrary to most methods widely used in the literature, the present work proposes to jointly exploit information from SAR and AIS raw data in order to detect the absence or presence of a ship using a binary hypothesis testing problem. This detection problem is handled by a generalized likelihood ratio detector whose test statistics has a simple closed form expression. The distribution of the test statistics is derived under both hypotheses, allowing the corresponding receiver operational characteristics (ROCs) to be computed.

To solve this problem, the main contribution of the letter effectively proposed a dissimilarity and saliency measure method. First, based on the different orientations feature between the target and the background, the suspected target patches are extracted by revised visual attention model (RVAM). Second, considering the nonlocal characteristics of the target, a novel nonlocal dissimilarity measure is proposed to achieve clutter suppression and target enhancement. Finally, since the intensity changes of target and background in continuous frames, the multiframe saliency measure method is applied to remove clutter noise with low intensity similar to the target shape.

"hkpm: a hierarchical key-area perception model for hfswr maritime surveillance","2022","High-frequency surface wave radar (HFSWR) has become the cornerstone of maritime surveillance because of its low-cost maintenance and coverage of wide area. However, when it comes to the extraction of key areas, such as vessel-target detection and vessel-path tracking, the HFSWR signal is strongly interfered by clutters and noise, which makes maritime surveillance a challenging task. This article proposes a hierarchical key-area perception model for maritime surveillance harnessing range-Doppler (RD) image from HFSWR, Laplacian kernel, a linear classifier (LC), and a subnet-based multilayer representation learning framework (SMRLF). First, a weak LC with a Laplacian kernel is utilized to capture the plausible vessel regions (PVRs). Then, a novel SMRLF is proposed to localize the vessel targets from the PVRs. To handle the noise, a maximum correntropy criterion with variable centers (MCC-VC) is incorporated in the subnet-based learning model. A thorough experimental analysis on cross-domain samples from radar dataset to scene classification dataset shows that the proposed HKPM performs competitively. The model shows a superior performance over most of the state-of-the-art vessel-target detection algorithms with a vessel-target detection accuracy of 94%. The extended analysis on image classification problem proves that the proposed model has great adaptivity and scalability.","vessel-target detection accuracy,HKPM,Kernel,marine radar,subnet-based multilayer representation learning framework,Discrete wavelet transforms,radar clutter,plausible vessel regions,Laplacian kernel,range-Doppler (RD) image,vessel-path tracking,maritime surveillance harnessing RD image,hierarchical key-area perception model,image classification problem,radar computing,vessel-target detection algorithms,maximum correntropy criterion with variable centers,linear classifier,maritime surveillance,radar dataset,object detection,feature extraction,image classification,search radar,High-frequency surface wave radar (HFSWR),radar imaging,low-cost maintenance,Radar,SMRLF,maritime surveillance harnessing range-Doppler image,MCC-VC,Doppler radar,scene classification dataset,representation learning,Clutter,Radar imaging,HFSWR signal,Surveillance,Signal processing algorithms,learning (artificial intelligence),HFSWR maritime surveillance,high-frequency surface wave radar,"
"maritime precipitation distributions determined from airborne radar and multi-frequency radiometric measurements","1994","The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission, TRMM, satellite will carry the first rain measuring radar in space with microwave radiometers. To support the development of the TRMM, measurements from nadir viewing airborne radars and microwave radiometers were analyzed to develop algorithms to retrieve precipitation mass distributions. The present retrieval algorithm used a three layer model. In the lower layer, the algorithm used a modification of the Hitschfeld-Bordan radar equation to find the rain distribution. A cloud physics model was used to describe the melting process of the hydrometeors in the middle layer. The refractive indices of the melting and frozen hydrometeors were derived from Maxwell-Garnet theory applied to air and ice in the upper layer and air, ice and water mixtures in the melting layer. Spherical raindrops, spheres consisting of ice and air to represent graupel and hail, disks containing ice and air to represent snow dendrites and ice cylinders to represent needles at the cloud tops were assumed in the scattering computations. A backward Monte-Carlo radiative transfer model was applied to the horizontally and vertically inhomogeneous model clouds to compute the brightness temperatures that emerged from these clouds. The distributions of computed 10 GHz radar reflectivity factors, and brightness temperatures were optimized to the corresponding measurements by applying Marquardt's non-linear least squares minimization to precipitation model parameters. The algorithm yielded the distribution of the precipitation mass density along a flight path that passed over Typhoon Flo in 1990. The resulting model was validated by comparing the measured and the modeled distributions of the 35 GHz effective radar reflectivity factors and modeled and measured 192 GHz brightness temperatures.<>","airborne radar,three layer model,remote sensing,rain,spaceborne radar remote sensing,microwave radiometry,multi-frequency radiometry,algorithm,radar applications,EHF mm wave millimetric,Clouds,measurement technique,Radar measurements,Radiometers,SHF,Marquardt,rain rainfall,radiometry,marine atmosphere,Brightness temperature,Maxwell-Garnet theory,meteorological radar,Hitschfeld-Bordan radar equation,microwave measurement,Airborne radar,mass distribution,minimization,35 to 192 GHz,Rain,retrieval algorithm,spaceborne radar,tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission TRMM,Ice,Spaceborne radar,Microwave measurements,millimetre wave imaging,maritime precipitation distribution,remote sensing by radar,Reflectivity,atmospheric techniques,"

"first comparison of sentinel-1 and terrasar-x data in the framework of maritime targets detection: south italy case","2016","The Sentinel-1A is the first of two satellites that composes the Sentinel-1 radar mission. Both satellites operate a C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) system to give continuity to the European SAR program. SAR is a flexible sensor able to fulfil users/applications requirements in terms of resolution and coverage thanks to different operational modes and polarizations. With the in-orbit availability of very-high-resolution X-band SAR sensors, the Sentinel-1 satellites have been designed to achieve wide coverage at medium to high resolution. The interferometric wide swath (IWS) mode implemented with the terrain observation with progressive scan (TOPS) technique is the standard acquisition mode over European waters and land masses. IWS in dual-polarization (VV/VH) combination offers 250-km swath at 5 m Ã— 20 m (range Ã— azimuth) spatial resolution. These specifications are in line with the needs of the European Maritime and Security Agency (EMSA) for oil spill and ship detection applications included in the CleanSeaNet program. The main goals of this paper are: assessment of medium-to-high-resolution C-band Sentinel-1 data with very-high-resolution X-band TerraSAR-X data for maritime targets detection; synergetic use of multiplatforms satellite SAR data for target features extraction; evaluation of polarimetric target detectors for the available co-polarization and cross-polarization Sentinel-1A IWS VV/VH products.

"nonambiguous sar image formation of maritime targets using weighted sparse approach","2018","For a single-channel synthetic aperture radar (SAR), finite-pulse repetition frequency and nonideal antenna pattern cause azimuth ambiguities, i.e., ghosts in image domain. In this paper, a novel algorithm of locating processing weighted group lasso SAR image formation for maritime targets is proposed to effectively mitigate the ambiguities, which can work on a single-look complex SAR image. In the scheme, the ambiguous signal model using the conventional SAR focusing processor is first explicitly derived, showing the analytical expression of SAR image formulation. The weighted sparse group lasso algorithm is then employed to group-sparsely reconstruct the subimages of nonambiguous and ambiguous Doppler components. In particular, we introduce adaptively weighted sparsity constraint, obtained from a priori azimuth antenna pattern, and clutter clustering during sparse imaging. It should be emphasized that the proposed algorithm can effectively improve the azimuth resolution by coherently integrating the ambiguous signal components, which greatly helps the target detection and recognition in maritime surveillance. Finally, experiments based on simulated and measured data are performed to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.","sparse imaging,marine radar,image resolution,target detection,ambiguous signal model,sparse group lasso algorithm,Signal resolution,single-channel synthetic aperture radar,finite-pulse repetition frequency,radar antennas,clutter clustering,Doppler components,Synthetic aperture radar,maritime surveillance,Azimuth ambiguities,Focusing,object detection,radar target recognition,synthetic aperture radar,maritime targets,antenna pattern,image reconstruction,radar imaging,Doppler effect,antenna radiation patterns,SAR focusing processor,weighted sparse group lasso algorithm,Azimuth,weighted sparsity constraint,Image resolution,radar resolution,SAR image formulation,azimuth resolution,synthetic aperture radar (SAR),"
"realistic extended target model for track before detect in maritime surveillance","2015","Traditional target tracking algorithms are generally fed a set of thresholded detections under the hypothesis that no more than one detection is generated by each single target. Improvements in modern radar systems have made possible to obtain high resolution data of the targets, making them occupy more than a single resolution cell, and have made necessary to use appropriate Extended Target Tracking (ETT) techniques, since the aforementioned hypothesis is no longer valid. However, these techniques do not often take into account the physical phenomena that are involved in the radar-sea-target system. This paper explores some of the effects involved in the transmission, propagation, backscattering and processing of the radar signal in a maritime environment, that have a crucial importance in ETT. A statistical model that considers the featured effects is developed and tested in a particle filter based Track before Detect (TbD) algorithm. Accounting for physical aspects, good outcomes in both kinematic (i.e. position and velocity) and size (i.e. width and length) estimation can be pointed out using real radar data acquired by a high resolution X-band Marine radar located in the Gulf of La Spezia, Italy.","maritime surveillance environment,marine radar,radar-sea-target system,Radar antennas,radar detection,statistical model,data acquisition,Italy,Antenna radiation patterns,TbD algorithm,statistical analysis,target tracking,Target tracking,particle filtering (numerical methods),Gulf of La Spezia,radar signal backscattering,search radar,Radar tracking,radar signal propagation,Convolution,radar signal processing,high resolution X-band marine radar,radar tracking,track before detect algorithm,radar signal transmission,Clutter,radar resolution,extended target tracking technique,particle filter,data target resolution,backscatter,ETT technique,oceanographic techniques,"
"convolutional neural network-based novel framework for ship recognition in poor visibility maritime surveillance videos","2023","Ship recognition is a central component of the information perception for smart ships. Traditionally, the ship recognition mission is completed by remote sensing or synthetic aperture radar (SAR) or manual calibration via maritime surveillance video. However, the difficulty arises in implementing the mission when it suffers the weather with a poor visibility. The recognition accuracy may deteriorate dramatically in such a hostile environment, especially in the heavy fog environment at sea when using conventional methods. In this case, we develop a novel framework for ship recognition based on a smart recognition system that relies on the dark channel defogging and the neural networks. First, a dark-channel defogging algorithm is utilized to remove the adverse impact of poor visibility on recognition. After that, three different neural networks are used to train the defogged images (Specifically: Faster-RCNN, SSD, YOLOv3). Finally, we present qualitative and quantitative analyses of three different neural network models. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in a hostile environment, especially in fog weather with poor visibility at sea.","Image recognition,Neural networks,Ship recognition,Sea surface,Visualization,Surveillance,Robust framework,Marine vehicles,Statistical analysis,Convolutional Neural Networks,Defog method,"

"coprime synthetic aperture radar (copsar): a new acquisition mode for maritime surveillance","2015","In this paper, we propose a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) technique able, in the case of bright targets over a dark background, to reduce the amount of data to be stored and processed, and, at the same time, to increase the range swath, with no geometric resolution loss. Accordingly, the proposed approach can be usefully employed in ocean monitoring for ship detection. The technique consists of a new SAR acquisition mode and of very simple processing. It is based on the adaptation of the coprime array beamforming concept to the case of SAR systems: two interlaced sequences of pulses are transmitted, with two sub-Nyquist pulse repetition frequencies (PRFs) that are equal to the Nyquist PRF divided by two coprime integer numbers. Each sequence is separately processed via standard SAR processing, and the two final aliased images are combined in a very simple way to cancel aliasing. We call the proposed approach â€œcoprime SARâ€ (CopSAR). Three different implementations are proposed, and the effectiveness of the CopSAR concept is demonstrated by using both simulated and real SAR data. It turns out that the significant data amount reduction and the range swath increase are only paid with a reduction of the target-to-background ratio and with the presence of a (nonstringent) limit on ship azimuth size.","range swath,standard SAR processing,Antennas,coprime array beamforming concept,ship detection,CopSAR target-to-background ratio,SAR systems,Marine vehicles,coprime synthetic aperture radar,sub-Nyquist pulse repetition frequencies,Synthetic aperture radar,ocean monitoring,SAR technique,Standards,maritime surveillance,synthetic aperture radar,synthetic aperture radar (SAR),geometric resolution loss,CopSAR concept,maritime applications,SAR acquisition mode,Azimuth,Sensors,ship azimuth size,Coprime sampling,remote sensing by radar,Arrays,oceanographic techniques,"
"vessel detection and classification: an integrated maritime surveillance system in the tyrrhenian sea","2010","In recent years a number of organizations, both national and international, have put significant efforts in developing knowledge-based integrated maritime surveillance (IMS) systems. The final aim is to have a clear picture of the position, classification, identification and movement of cooperative and non-cooperative targets entering and leaving the 200 nautical miles limit of the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). Each sensor (i.e. satellite-based, ground-based, shipborne or airborne) has its own task and, in such a context, high frequency (HF) surface wave (SW) radars are inexpensive tools for long range early warning applications in open waters. They allow maximizing the effectiveness in dealing with fisheries protection, drug interdiction, illegal immigration, terrorist threats, search and rescue tasks. This paper focuses on the possibility of combining automatic identification system (AIS) data with HFSWR data for vessel detection and classification purposes. Three algorithms for target detection in compound Gaussian HF sea clutter are presented and their performance evaluated. The combined use of AIS plots provided by cooperative targets can allow the operator to discriminate non-cooperative targets and possible threats.

"keynote: multi-domain situational awareness - from the underwater to the space domain to improve maritime surveillance","2022","Modern surveillance systems require to integrate coherently all available sources of information to compose an operational picture that is as complete as possible. While in the past surveillance had suffered from a lack of data, current technology transformed the problem into one of an overabundance of information, leading to an extreme need for automated analysis. Indeed, current surveillance sensors generate volumes of data that would have been unthinkable only a few years ago. Therefore, all the processing, algorithm calibration, parameter tuning, etc., need to be executed as much automatically as possible. This also requires novel paradigms for algorithmic design. In this respect, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Data Fusion (DF) offer an unprecedented opportunity to strengthen the technological edge; however, the risk is to elevate, at the same time, the speed of the threats we face. Indeed, the surveillance task is complicated by the diversification of threats, whose nature and origin is most often unknown. AI and DF techniques have the potential to identify patterns emerging within these very large datasets, fused from a variety of sources and generated from monitoring wide areas on a day-to-day basis, and use the learned knowledge to anticipate the possible evolution(s) of the operational picture.

"a provisional climatology of cool-season convective lines in the uk","2013","A 7-year climatology of cool-season convective lines in the UK has been constructed using archived radar rainfall data. 103 lines meeting basic size, duration and intensity criteria were identified over the period September 2003 to February 2010. Of these, 87% occurred in association with frontal systems (mostly cold fronts). The remaining 13% occurred within polar-maritime air masses to the rear of frontal systems. Annual frequencies were highest over inland areas of southern and central England (5.0–7.5 events per 10,000km2, per year) and decreased markedly to the north (<1.0 events per 10,000km2, per year over north and west Scotland). Tornado and Storm Research Organisation (TORRO) tornado data revealed that 27.2% of lines produced at least one tornado. The environment of tornadic and non-tornadic lines was investigated by analysis of available observations, from which representative values of various environmental parameters were obtained. Tornadic lines were found to be associated with significantly larger pre-line surface-based CAPE, line-normal forward motion, cross-line horizontal wind veer, and cross-line temperature decrease. Furthermore, a tendency for tornadic lines to occur near the core, or under the left exit region, of mid-level jets was apparent.","Cold front,Tornado,Squall line,Line convection,Severe convection,TORRO,"

"maritime targets velocity estimation in space-based passive multistatic radar using long integration times","2021","Target detection by means of space-based passive radar sensors generally requires the adoption of long integration time strategies to reinforce sufficiently the signal strength. These are usually based on the recovery of the target Doppler-rate to cope with the range and Doppler migration experienced over the long dwell considered.

Both the cases of single-element and array receiver configurations have been considered. Theoretical and numerical results under different use cases show as leveraging on the long integration times adopted at the detection stage could significantly increase the accuracy of the estimated ship velocity components. Few experimental results are also provided, verifying the potentialities of the proposed approach in operative scenarios of practical interest for this technology. The proposed approach is not limited at the GNSS case, but it could be potentially applied to any multistatic passive radar system.","Satellites,estimated ship velocity components,Taylor-series approach,space-based passive radar sensors,Radar antennas,target detection,passive radar,Marine vehicles,signal strength,ship velocity estimation,detection stage,long integration time strategies,maritime targets velocity estimation,multistatic passive radar system,satellite navigation,single-element,GNSS-based radar,maritime surveillance,Global Navigation Satellite Systems-based multistatic radar configurations,object detection,ship targets,array receiver configurations,long integration times,space-based passive multistatic radar,target Doppler-rate,bistatic Doppler-rates,GNSS case,radar receivers,Radar,radar tracking,multistatic radar,Doppler radar,Passive radar,conventional Doppler-based procedures,Spaceborne radar,Estimation,Doppler migration,"

"sarfish: space-based maritime surveillance using complex synthetic aperture radar imagery","2022","Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery is an essential part of maritime surveillance since it can operate in most weather conditions, day and night. Space-borne SAR especially can provide a large surveillance coverage in which both ground-range detected (GRD) imagery at a reduced resolution and single-look complex (SLC) imagery at a finer resolution of the same observation scene are available. Recently, a large, fully labeled, Sentinel-1 GRD based dataset, named xView3-SAR, was released to promote machine learning (ML) research in detection and classification of ships in order to assist with monitoring illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing activities. In this paper, the xView3-SAR's companion SLC dataset, called the SARFish, is introduced. The aim is to promote the use of SLC data for improving IUU fishing ship detection and classification. An ML-based algorithm using the combined GRD-SLC SAR data is presented as a base-line model for demonstration. The algorithm consists of a constant false-alarm rate (CFAR) detector whose false-alarm rate is reduced by a cascade of classifiers trained using the GRD data, followed by a ship classifier trained using the SLC data. Preliminary results suggest that despite not using multi-looks to reduce sea-clutter spikes, the use of SLC images does not degrade ship detection. Furthermore, a very modest improvement in ship classification is observed.11Under contract from Rheinmetall Defence Australia Pty Ltd, Adelaide, SA, Australia.","radio frequencies,classification,space-based maritime Surveillance,Marine vehicles,Machine learning,maritime vessels,maritime objects,Synthetic aperture radar,geophysical image processing,Meteorology,complex Synthetic Aperture Radar imagery,MS,visible frequencies,electro-optic imaging,single-look complex (SLC),synthetic aperture radar,Classification algorithms,radar imaging,Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR),Radar polarimetry,SARFish,sufficient spatial resolution,Australia,radar imaging category,Image resolution,ground-range detected (GRD),constant false-alarm rate (CFAR) detection,space-borne SAR imagery,Surveillance,imaging modalities,Spaceborne radar,remote sensing by radar,image coverage,machine learning (ML),image scene,"
"maritime surveillance with undersampled sar","2017","According to the minimum antenna area constraint, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems require a low-pulse repetition frequency (PRF) to image the wide swaths in ocean surface monitoring scenarios. However, the low PRF that is lower than the Doppler bandwidth will cause azimuth ambiguities. This letter proposes a novel method of mitigating azimuth ambiguities when using an undersampled SAR system for ship detection over the open sea. In this letter, the concept of range subspectra is adopted to misregister the azimuth ambiguity signals. In addition, a change detection method that uses a principal component analysis and k-means clustering is adopted to detect differences in the azimuth ambiguities between two range subspectra images in which the azimuth ambiguities are misregistered. By compensating for the ambiguities in the corresponding image, the ambiguities can be mitigated. This method is only appropriate for bright targets over dark backgrounds in which residual energy loss occurs for useful signals. Both simulated and real data processing results have validated the effectiveness of the proposed method and show that it is feasible for maritime surveillance.","two range subspectra images,ship detection,low-pulse repetition frequency,change detection method,azimuth ambiguity mitigation method,bright targets,Principal component analysis,range subspectrum,Synthetic aperture radar,undersampled,undersampled SAR system,image ambiguities,maritime surveillance,Azimuth ambiguities,real data processing,synthetic aperture radar,ocean surface monitoring scenarios,azimuth ambiguity signals,range subspectra concept,Doppler effect,dark backgrounds,Bandwidth,Azimuth,Doppler bandwidth,residual energy loss,open sea,Imaging,synthetic aperture radar systems,principal component analysis,Barium,minimum antenna area,synthetic aperture radar (SAR),k-mean clustering,oceanographic techniques,"

"comparison of detectability of ship wake components between c-band and x-band synthetic aperture radar sensors operating under different slant ranges","2023","The detectability of wake components is affected by influencing parameters, which can be categorized into ship properties, environmental conditions and image acquisition settings. The characteristics of influences of most influencing parameters on the detectability are established. However, a consequent investigation and systematization of influences regarding differences in settings of various SARs have not been published. In this study, data from four different SARs missions, namely TerraSAR–X (TSX), CosmoSkymed (CSK), Sentinel–1 (S1) and RADARSAT–2 (RS2), were collected and analyzed with focus on detectability of ship wake components. The sensors operate on different orbit altitudes and radar frequency bands: TSX and CSK work with X–Band, S1 and RS2 work with C–Band. Using methods from the field of Data Science, the detectability of wake components is modelled for each of the four sensors using machine leaning by the support vector machine (SVM) method. The created SVM-models are then compared in order to derive statements regarding relative detectability of individual wake components. A measure of detectability model’s uncertainty and an alternative analysis based on accumulated backscattering statistics is presented to support the derived statements. In conclusion, sensors with shorter slant ranges and X–Band in comparison to C–Band were found to be better suited for the detection of ship wakes. However, these characteristics only hold for wake components detectable due to the Bragg scattering mechanism, i.e. Kelvin wake arms and V-narrow wakes. No significant difference for near and far field of turbulent wakes is recognized.","Ship wake detection,Synthetic aperture radar,Maritime object detection,Detectability modelling,Machine learning,"

Today's military services have faced challenges of maintaining financial stability of training activities. Thus most of them focus into computational simulators can be used as a safe alternative in a cost beneficial manner. Considering field of military, radar simulators plays important role in simulations. This research focuses on simulating sea-born radar for 3D virtual maritime environment.

It captures the surrounding objects and gives the 2D visualization of the 3D environment as the end result. In the static environment perception both radar and environment are considered to be stagnant.

"bayesian filtering for dynamic anomaly detection and tracking","2022","This article presents a Bayesian approach for sequential detection of anomalies in the motion of a target and joint tracking. The anomaly is modeled as a binary (on/off) switching unknown control input that goes into action (begins to exist, or â€œswitches onâ€) thereby modifying the object dynamics; and by ceasing its activity (becoming nonexistent, or â€œswitching offâ€) returns the dynamics to nominal. The developed Bayesian framework brings together random finite set (RFS) theory to represent the switching nature of the anomaly, and optimal joint input and state estimation to sequentially update a hybrid state that incorporates a random vector for the kinematic state and a Bernoulli RFS for the unknown control input. In addition, a closed-form solution, the Gaussian-mixture hybrid Bernoulli filter (GM-HBF), has been developed to provide a customized solution for dynamic anomaly detection in the maritime domain characterized by linear Gaussian target dynamics. Based on the Ornsteinâ€“Uhlenbeck dynamic model for vessels, where the evolution of the object velocity is governed by a piecewise mean-reverting stochastic process, the anomaly can be represented by a change in the long-run mean velocity (i.e., the unknown control input) from the nominal condition that forces the vessel to deviate from its standard route. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed GM-HBF in both simulated and real-world maritime surveillance applications and test its performance in the face of false measurements, detection uncertainty, and sensor data gaps.","developed Bayesian framework,surveillance,kinematic state,Mathematical models,Anomaly detection,Automatic identification system (AIS),Bayesian approach,random finite sets (RFSs),Bayesian filtering,Bayes methods,object dynamics,linear Gaussian target dynamics,Switches,Bernoulli filter,switching unknown control input,Radio frequency,target tracking,Aerodynamics,stochastic processes,filtering theory,radar,state estimation,detection uncertainty,Gaussian processes,Bernoulli RFS,Radar tracking,maritime anomaly detection,dynamic anomaly detection,joint input and state estimation (JISE),probability,Ornstein-Uhlenbeck dynamic model,GM-HBF,Gaussian-mixture hybrid Bernoulli filter,"

"modern electro-optical imaging system for maritime surveillance applications","2010","Asymmetric attacks against maritime platforms often emerge suddenly, non-predictably and from civil environments. Adequate reaction to intercept possible threats requires a quick and overall perception of the emerging situation.

"high-squint sar imaging of maritime ship targets","2022","High-squint synthetic aperture radar (HS-SAR) imaging technology greatly enhances the flexibility of SAR. However, the existing HS-SAR imaging algorithms are generally based on the assumption that the illuminated target is static during the synthetic aperture formation. As a consequence, the state-of-the-art algorithms are unable to focus on moving targets well, thus leading to displaced and blurred images of the targets. A maritime ship is a typical kind of moving target with complex noncooperative motion, which has received much attention. Thus, it is a difficult but valuable issue to study HS-SAR imaging of ship targets. In this work, the influence of ship translation and fluctuation is theoretically analyzed. On the basis of these analyses, the new conception of â€œthird range compression (TRC)â€ caused by ship translation is proposed, and the squint minimization (SM) operation is implemented for the compensation of TRC. Moreover, considering that the target Doppler parameters induced by ship fluctuation are related to its position, a novel method called WASH-CLEAN (watershed and CLEAN) is proposed to automatically focus ship scattering points with different swings.

"change detection support for supervisory controllers of highly automated systems: effects on performance, mental workload, and recovery of situation awareness following interruptions","2018","Dynamic Positioning (DP) is a computer-controlled process to automatically keep a floating vessel at a specific position or to follow a pre-defined path (tracking) by using its own propellers and thrusters. The human supervisory controller has no direct need to constantly know what the status is of all parts of the automation and the system it is controlling, because the highly automated DPS is controlling all components itself. Only after a failure arises, the operator needs to take over manual control and take appropriate action(s) to prevent the failure from harming the operation. As the supervisory controller may be out of the loop, swiftly taking over control may be problematic when failures arise. The purpose of the current study was to investigate whether automation of change detection enables human operators with low awareness of the automation and the system it is controlling to quickly recover awareness in emergency take-over situations. A 2 by 2 within subjects experiment was conducted using a DP simulation (n = 22). Within-subjects factors were support (Yes, No) and interruption (Yes, No). Results showed that change detection support helps in the process of recovering situation awareness after it has been reduced, due to an interruption of the primary task of overseeing the automation. Interestingly, support was not beneficial to the participants in all conditions. In non-interrupted conditions the support unexpectedly resulted in higher workload, raising questions whether supervisory controllers should be supported continuously or only when it is required. Relevance to industry: The results show that change detection support has potential value in operational maritime environments, especially in situations where the DP operator has low situation awareness. Future research should investigate whether adaptive aiding could alleviate some of the negative effects of non-adaptive operator support in maritime environments.","Management-by-exception,Situation Awareness Recovery (SAR),Dynamic positioning,Human-automation collaboration,Out-of-the-loop (OOTL) performance problem,"

This paper presents a vessel prediction method, based on the popular Ornstein-Uhlenbeck stochastic processes, whose parameters are estimated from historical patterns of life. The historical traffic routes are obtained by pre-processing Automatic Identification System (AIS) data via the CMRE tool called Traffic Route Extraction for Anomaly Detection (TREAD). These recurrent routes allow prediction of the position of a vessel that is following one of these routes, surprisingly, by several hours.

"wodis: water obstacle detection network based on image segmentation for autonomous surface vehicles in maritime environments","2021","A reliable obstacle detection system is crucial for autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) to realize fully autonomous navigation with no need of human intervention. However, the current detection methods have particular drawbacks, such as poor detection for small objects, low estimation accuracy caused by water surface reflection, and a high rate of false-positive on water-sky interference. Therefore, we propose a new encoder-decoder structured deep semantic segmentation network, which is a water obstacle detection network based on image segmentation (WODIS), to solve the abovementioned problems. The first design feature of WODIS utilizes the use of an encoder network to extract high-level data based on different sampling rates. In order to improve obstacle detection at sea-sky line areas, an attention refine module (ARM) activated by both global average pooling and max pooling to capture high-level information has been designed and integrated into WODIS. In addition, a feature fusion module (FFM) is introduced to help concatenate the multidimensional high-level features in the decoder network.

"a cnn-lstm network for augmenting target detection in real maritime wide area surveillance radar data","2020","Typical radar detectors exploit only a small proportion of the valuable information contained in radar reflections, i.e. magnitude and Doppler. A neural network-based approach for augmenting traditional radar detector structures using machine learning (ML) is proposed in this paper. Specifically, the network is designed to augment target detection in the field of maritime wide area surveillance for non-coherent data. A combination network consisting of a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract spatial features and a long short-term memory (LSTM) for extracting temporal patterns in the spatial features is proposed. The network augments the detector structure by blanking out regions of the frame which are classified as not containing a target, thus reducing false alarms. The network is tested on data containing four marine targets collected by a ground-based radar. The data set was chosen because it contains strong sea clutter returns.

Bayesian methodology provides established instruments for fusion of uncertain identification and assessment indications from various information sources. Particularly, Bayesian Networks are well qualified for modeling and inference in this application context. In order to standardize and simplify generation of Bayesian Identification Networks for new operational scenarios, a generic Bayesian Network for identification is proposed. This generic model defines adequate and necessary node types, well suited for modeling of identification and assessment tasks. In addition, the model provides a dependency structure by subgraphs, which simplifies provision of more complex cause-effect relations in Bayesian Identification Networks.

Identifying anomalies (e.g. unplanned maneuvers) for test case generation is an important topic in the development process of highly automated systems.

By observing vessel tracks, the behavior can be derived from the driven maneuvers of a vessel. Extracting maneuvers out of historical observation data (e.g. AIS) is an important task.

"beyond visible light: usage of long wave infrared for object detection in maritime environment","2021","Autonomous navigation of land vehicles has come a long way owing to the advances in scene parsing capabilities enabled by deep learning. Maritime environment shows an equally great promise in such autonomy and research specific to this domain is gaining rapid momentum. Extreme weather and light conditions are typical at seas and optical cameras commonly used on land face limitations in such environment. This paper proposes usage of Long Wave Infrared (LWIR) cameras to overcome these challenges. We evaluate the effectiveness of LWIR by running semantic segmentation against two deep learning architectures under normal and challenging conditions and then comparing their performance against their optical counterparts. Experimental results show that LWIR outperforms optical in such extreme weather and light conditions and will prove very effective in the maritime environment. Integrating LWIR with optical, radar and other sensors in the robotic navigation systems can improve the accuracy of object detection and avoidance in autonomous surface vehicles. The research also focuses on key areas where the algorithm can be enhanced as well as creation of a public maritime dataset of LWIR images as the next steps.","Ultraviolet sources,Optical imaging,long wave infrared images,long wave infrared cameras,deep learning (artificial intelligence),extreme weather,semantic segmentation,Surface waves,robot vision,normal conditions,light conditions,LWIR images,control engineering computing,scene parsing capabilities,optical cameras,deep learning architectures,Integrated optics,marine engineering,radar,cameras,object detection,public maritime dataset,autonomous surface vehicles,land vehicles,path planning,robotic navigation systems,marine robotics,Training,infrared imaging,land face limitations,unmanned surface vehicles,mobile robots,image sensors,Object detection,Navigation,image segmentation,deep learning architecture,autonomous navigation,visible light,"

"antenna beampattern matched optimum coherent detection in high-resolution mechanically scanning maritime surveillance radars","2023","Mechanically scanning radars are still widely used in ocean guard and surveillance areas nowadays, owing to simple structure, light weight and low cost. The antenna rotation causes amplitude modulation of target returns along pulses by the antenna azimuth beampattern. The traditional coherent detection that ignores this modulation suffers from some performance loss. In this article, an antenna beampattern matched optimum coherent detector and a dual-threshold detection scheme are proposed for high-resolution mechanically scanning maritime surveillance radars. First, it is shown that the modulation of target returns is determined by the antenna azimuth beampattern, scan rate, and pulse repetition interval and the antenna scanning also affect the temporal correlation of sea clutter. Second, the antenna beampattern matched optimum coherent detector is given in compound-Gaussian sea clutter with inverse Gamma distributed texture and the pulse scanning mode is used to deal with unknown target azimuth angle in the matched filter. Third, to mitigate the high computational cost of the pulse scanning mode, a dual-threshold scheme is given, which searches all pulse-range cells by short-time integration and further confirms suspected cells whose test statistics are between the two lower and higher thresholds in the search by long-time integration. Moreover, two fast recursive clutter covariance matrix inversion algorithms along pulses and range cells are presented, which bring a great reduction in computational complexity. Finally, real measured radar data is used to verify the proposed detector and scheme and the experimental results show that it behaves better in detection of small targets than the traditional detectors.","Antennas,covariance matrices,maritime surveillance radars,Radar antennas,mechanically scanning maritime surveillance radars,radar detection,radar clutter,high-resolution mechanically scanning maritime surveillance,compound-Gaussian sea clutter,sea clutter,amplitude modulation,target returns,dual-threshold detection scheme,matched filter,optimum coherent detector,scan rate,surveillance areas,ocean guard,gamma distribution,traditional coherent detection,dual-threshold scheme,Antenna beampattern matched optimum coherent detection,Gaussian processes,matrix inversion,search radar,measured radar data,unknown target,Radar,radar signal processing,antenna azimuth beampattern,antenna beampattern matched optimum coherent detection,high computational cost,azimuth beampattern modulation,Doppler radar,computational complexity,Clutter,scanning radars,fast recursive clutter covariance matrix inversion algorithms,pulse scanning mode,antenna rotation,Surveillance,pulse-range cells,antenna scanning,pulse repetition interval,Radar detection,"
"an unambiguous imaging method of moving target for maritime scenes with spaceborne high-resolution and wide-swath sar","2022","In azimuth multichannel high-resolution and wide-swath (AMC-HRWS) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) system, undersampling of azimuth signal results in the failure of the single-channel echo imaging, so the echoes of all the channels should be reconstructed to obtain the unambiguous SAR image. Many methods have been proposed to reconstruct the stationary scene echoes. However, moving targets (MTs) will cause false targets in the reconstructed SAR image, which has a great influence on SAR image interpretation and moving target detection, especially in maritime scenes. Hence, we propose an unambiguous imaging method of the moving target for maritime scenes with AMC-HRWS SAR. First, azimuth deramp processing is introduced to obtain coarse-focused moving targets, and then their echoes can be extracted from the sea clutter. Based on the extracted data, a radial velocity estimation method is proposed, which is high efficiency and does not require redundant channels. In addition, based on the estimated radial velocity and the characteristics of the coarse-focused signal, a novel signal reconstruction method of moving target is presented. The reconstruction performance of this method is not affected by channel imbalance, and false targets can be removed even if there is radial velocity error. Besides, the effectiveness of this scheme is verified by the simulation data and GaoFen-3 SAR real data. The estimated radial velocities of ships are verified by automatic identification system (AIS) information. The imaging results show that false targets are effectively suppressed, and moving targets are located in correct positions.","moving target detection,GaoFen-3 SAR real data,stationary scene echoes,SAR image interpretation,Image reconstruction,image resolution,azimuth multichannel high-resolution,image sampling,wide-swath SAR,single-channel echo imaging,Synthetic aperture radar,Signal reconstruction,high-resolution and wide-swath (HRWS),AMC-HRWS SAR,false targets,object detection,synthetic aperture radar,radial velocity estimation method,signal reconstruction,unambiguous imaging method,image reconstruction,radar imaging,Doppler effect,moving target (MT) signal reconstruction,novel signal reconstruction method,radial velocity estimation,maritime scenes,Azimuth,spaceborne high-resolution,unambiguous SAR image,Imaging,maritime scene,Estimation,synthetic aperture radar (SAR),reconstructed SAR image,Azimuth multichannel (AMC),"

"global decrease in heavy metal concentrations in brown algae in the last 90 years","2023","In the current scenario of global change, heavy metal pollution is of major concern because of its associated toxic effects and the persistence of these pollutants in the environment. This study is the first to evaluate the changes in heavy metal concentrations worldwide in brown algae over the last 90 years (>15,700 data across the globe reported from 1933 to 2020). The study findings revealed significant decreases in the concentrations of Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, Mn, Pb and Zn of around 60–84% (ca. 2% annual) in brown algae tissues. The decreases were consistent across the different families considered (Dictyotaceae, Fucaceae, Laminariaceae, Sargassaceae and Others), and began between 1970 and 1990. In addition, strong relationships between these trends and pH, SST and heat content were detected. Although the observed metal declines could be partially explained by these strong correlations, or by adaptions in the algae, other evidences suggest an actual reduction in metal concentrations in oceans because of the implementation of environmental policies. In any case, this study shows a reduction in metal concentrations in brown algae over the last 50 years, which is important in itself, as brown algae form the basis of many marine food webs and are therefore potential distributors of pollutants.","Temporal trends,Hazardous elements,Marine pollution,Biomonitoring,Climate change,"

"on some cognitive processing for airborne maritime radar","2017","This paper deals with the issue of detection tasks optimization in the case of airborne radar for maritime surveillance mission thanks to cognitive mechanisms, more precisely thanks to the learning of the radar environment (clutter). The proposed algorithm aims at selecting the most appropriate radar mode, if applicable the most appropriate platform altitude and horizontal position by analyzing the sea clutter. The analysis of the environment and then the inference of a more favorable mode of operation are based on the adjustment of the measurements to environment models, in particular clutter models. Another way to improve detection performance is the introduction of external knowledge in processing (Knowledge-Aided processing). An example of constant false alarm rate processing using external information for improving detection near the coasts is presented at the end of this paper.","airborne radar,constant false alarm rate processing,marine radar,radar detection,radar clutter,cognitive processing,platform altitude position,airborne maritime radar,Atmospheric modeling,horizontal position,detection tasks optimization,Shape,knowledge-aided processing,radar environment,Radar cross-sections,Radar clutter,maritime surveillance mission,Airborne radar,Clutter,environment models,sea clutter analysis,"

Two types of tests were performed on samples of maritime pine timber (Pinus pinaster Ait.).

"an intelligent decision algorithm for the generation of maritime search and rescue emergency response plans","2019","Maritime search and rescue (SAR) decisions are the most important part of maritime SAR operations. In the process of making maritime SAR decisions, a key factor affecting efficiency and success rate is how to quickly respond to accidents and develop an emergency response plan. At present, maritime SAR emergency response plans are still mostly obtained through a combination of drift prediction models and SAR experience. There is a lack of SAR resource scheduling and SAR task assignment. The primary purpose of this paper is to explore the possibility of using an intelligent decision-making algorithm to formulate maritime SAR emergency response plans so as to produce results more scientifically. First, the relevant research areas and research data are briefly introduced, and the main mathematical models involved in the optimal search theory are expounded. Next, key technologies involved in the process of maritime SAR emergency response plan generation, including the determination of search area, the scheduling of SAR resources, the allocation of search tasks, and the planning of search routes, are analyzed in detail. Two optimization model algorithms, namely the SAR resource scheduling model based on genetic simulated annealing algorithm (GSAA) and the regional task allocation algorithm based on space-time characteristics, are proposed as approaches to solving the problem of resource scheduling and task allocation. Finally, the effectiveness and optimization of the proposed algorithms are verified by analyzing the emergency response of a real case which occurred in the Bohai Sea and comparing the different schemes.

"estimation of target detectability for maritime target tracking in the pda framework","2019","The detection probability of maritime vessels may change over time, either slowly or more abruptly, due to effects such as sea state and varying aspect angle. If the varying detectability is not accounted for in the tracking system, tracks may be terminated or lost. The undetected targets may cause dangerous situations in applications such as maritime collision avoidance. In the following, we propose two methods for tracking targets with varying detection probability, both in the integrated probabilistic data association (IPDA) framework. One method uses the number of validated measurements to estimate the detectability of the target, while the other calculates the joint detectability and existence probabilities based on the measurement association likelihoods.

"target observability improvement in multi-static maritime forward scatter radar","2014","In recent years, the use of shore or buoy mounted forward scatter radar transceivers for the detection of small, low radar cross section, slow speed (otherwise termed low detectability) maritime targets has been proposed and investigated. Work has focused on the fundamental development of the single baseline link, which would form the basis of any netted system and has mostly been investigated at the lower end of the sea state scale. However as sea state increases, one of the main issues for target detection becomes the visibility time due to line of sight interruption. With a single line chain, this could be a major drawback for the system function as a whole, restricting its use to lower sea states. The formation of multiple baselines using multi-static transceivers could however improve the situation greatly. This paper investigates target observability in both single baseline and multi-baseline systems in an effort to estimate the level of improvement possible.","multistatic transceivers,Antennas,maritime,Vectors,radar detection,radio transceivers,target detection,Surface waves,line of sight interruption,observability,forward scatter,multi-static,radar target recognition,Sea surface,Surface treatment,buoy mounted forward scatter radar transceivers,Sea state,radar network,Radar,multistatic maritime forward scatter radar,baseline link,target observability,radar cross section,"
"supporting maritime search and rescue missions through uas-based wireless localization","2018","The use of unmanned aircraft systems to support maritime search and rescue missions holds great potential. Applications range from the fast and efficient search of vessels and persons in distress to the provision of rescue and communication resources. In this paper, we address a received signal strength based localization method of persons without dedicated search and rescue equipment. The specific challenge addressed in this work is to analyze the proposed localization method under realistic conditions. Thus, a maritime channel model is implemented and by means of field tests experimentally validated. Furthermore, the proposed approach is evaluated in a two step concept: In the first step the capability of different search patterns and localization algorithms is analyzed and evaluated in a hardware in the loop simulation environment. In the second step, a scaled experimental setup, which uses a technology comparable to cellular communications, is evaluated to prove the viability of the overall system. Besides the overall accuracy, the required localization time is a key performance indicator. The resulting outcome of the simulations using active trajectory generation underlines the potential of the discussed approach by achieving localization errors of lower than 200 m in under 10 mins.

"performance measures for airborne maritime surveillance radars","1998","A typical performance specification for an airborne maritime surveillance radar might be defined as the ability to detect, say, a 5 m/sup 2/ target in sea state 3 at a range of at least 25 nmi in clear air, with a detection probability of 0.9 and with one false alarm per minute. This is a basic statement of a user's needs but it is very inadequate as a specification of the radar performance that is actually required. The performance of an operational radar is characterised by many other features, which are not simply summarised in terms of a detection range and false alarm rate in a generalised environment. In particular, concepts such as probability of detection and probability of false alarm are conventionally steady state performance measures, for operation in thermal noise or uniformly distributed clutter. In practice, the radar will be dynamically adjusting its thresholds in response to a spatially and temporally varying environment. This will lead to a dynamic variation in detection and false alarm rate that cannot be simply described by traditional methods. This paper describes some of the problems with standard performance measures which are used for radar and proposes a number of further measures which should be considered to fully characterise a radar, especially under dynamically changing conditions.","uniformly distributed clutter,operational radar,performance specification,search radar,airborne maritime surveillance radars,user's needs,performance measures,detection probability,steady state performance measures,thermal noise,detection range,dynamically changing conditions,false alarm rate,"
"global sensitivity of radar wave propagation power to environmental variables for a parabolic equation numerical simulation in maritime regions","2015","Numerous environmental factors impact radio wave propagation in the marine atmospheric boundary layer (MABL) through effects such as scattering and refraction. Furthermore, environmental parameters can interact with each other to either compound or reduce the impact of each individual parameter. Thus, in order to properly assess the sensitivity of radar wave propagation power to environmental variables a global sensitivity approach is needed. In this study, we examine the global sensitivity of propagation power to a number of environmental variables using a parabolic equation (PE) numerical simulation for maritime regions. The sensitivity analysis is performed using the Extended Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Test, which is a global variance-based method that can account for multi-degree interaction effects. The method is ideal for complex nonlinear models and permits computation of both leading order and total order sensitivity for each parameter. The study examines 16 environmental parameters, 8 sea state and 8 atmospheric, that are used to generate inputs for the Variable Terrain Radiowave Parabolic Equation (VTRPE) numerical simulation. This model uses a split-step rotated Green's function parabolic wave equation solution to the scalar wave equation for transverse field components derived from Maxwell's equations. The simulation accounts for effects of refraction (including ducting) as well as variable boundary conditions on water surfaces, such as wind seas, swell, and variable dielectric properties. Vertical profiles of atmospheric refractivity, which are assumed homogenous in range for this study, are generated using a simplified refractivity model that depends on the 8 atmospheric parameters and can generate linear refractivity profiles as well as evaporation, surface, and elevated ducts, including any combination of these ducts. Sea state parameters can be grouped into 3 general categories: surface dielectric properties, directionality, and surface roughness. Atmospheric parameters can be grouped into 4 general categories: evaporation layer, mixed layer, inversion layer, and upper layer parameters. We examine results in the context of these parameter groupings.",""
"the costa concordia last cruise: the first application of high frequency monitoring based on cosmo-skymed constellation for wreck removal","2016","The Italian vessel Costa Concordia wrecked on January 13th 2012 offshore the Giglio Island (Tuscany, Italy), with the loss of 32 lives. Salvage operation of the vessel started immediately after the wreck. This operation was the largest and most expensive maritime salvage ever attempted on a wrecked ship and it ended in July 2014 when the Costa Concordia was removed from the Giglio Island, and dragged in the port of Genoa where it was dismantled. The refloating and removal phases of the Costa Concordia were monitored, in the period between 14th and 27th of July, exploiting SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) images acquired by the X-band COSMO-SkyMed satellite constellation in crisis mode. The main targets of the monitoring system were: (i) the detection of possible spill of pollutant material from the vessel and (ii) to exclude that oil slicks, illegally produced by other vessels, could be improperly linked to the naval convoy during its transit along the route between the Giglio Island and the port of Genoa. Results point out that the adopted monitoring system, through the use of the COSMO-SkyMed constellation, can be profitably employed to monitor emergency phases related to single ship or naval convoy over wide areas and with a suitable temporal coverage.

It is proposed to carry out processing in two stages. First, space-time adaptive processing (STAP) is applied to exploit the spatial and temporal degrees of freedom available in the multichannel radar. Subsequently, target detection and tracking is performed using the track-before-detect method, applied to the STAP output.

"a bistatic synthetic aperture radar imagery simulation of maritime scene using the extended nonlinear chirp scaling algorithm","2013","A bistatic synthetic aperture radar (Bis-SAR) imagery simulation of an extended maritime scene is presented. An efficient facet scattering model is developed to collect the raw coupling scattering data from a ship located on sea surface. Then, to avoid the inefficiency of time-domain algorithms and the azimuth-invariant limit of conventional frequency-domain (FD) methods in the bistatic case, an extended nonlinear chirp scaling (NLCS) algorithm is proposed to handle the bistatic data collected from this facet scattering model.

"a preliminary study on an optical system for nautical and maritime traffic monitoring","2021","The nautical traffic is very difficult to monitor since many vessels are not cooperative. VTSs (Vessel Traffic Systems) use several sources of information for estimating shipsâ€™ Position Navigation and Velocity, such as AIS (Automatic Identification System) and RADAR (RAdio Detection And Ranging); nevertheless, VTS areas do not cover the entire costal area of a country. In many cases the classification and identification of small non-AIS vessels could provide an important to the safety of navigation.Indeed, especially during the summer, the nautical tourism has a great impact on the maritime traffic congestion. The issue involves many institutions such as Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) and local maritime authorities which are not able to monitor the high volume of nautical traffic. This work introduces an optical system designed to monitor the traffic in small coastal areas based on images acquired by a single camera. The reliability and accuracy of the system is conditioned by the size of the pixel on the sea surface (Ground Sample Distance-GSD) and by the camera footprint area as well. More in detail, this work focuses on the detection of the best camera placement on the coast for optimizing the GSD size and obtaining the shape of camera footprint. The inspection was conducted on a target area of the MPA â€œPunta Campanellaâ€ located on the Sorrento coast.","Optical imaging,local maritime authorities,maritime traffic monitoring,VTS areas,marine radar,Vessel Traffic Systems,nautical tourism,Cameras,Sea measurements,Metrology-Photogrammetry-Maritime Traffic Monitoring,Radio navigation,radio detection and ranging,entire costal area,nonAIS vessel classification,-Low cost-,ships,marine safety,Automatic Identification System,AIS,cameras,Shape,Sea surface,maritime traffic congestion,nautical traffic monitoring,Optical variables measurement,optical system,Positioning-Navigation,coastal areas,camera footprint area,radionavigation,nonAIS vessel identification,"
"assessment of marine litter through remote sensing: recent approaches and future goals","2021","This bibliographic review provides an overview of techniques used to detect marine litter using remote sensing. The review classified studies in terms of platform (satellite, aircrafts, drones), sensors (passive or active), spectral (visible, infrared, microwaves), spatial resolution (<1 to >30 m), type and size (macroplastics, microplastics), or classification methodology (sighting, photointerpretation, supervised). Most studies applied satellite information to address marine litter using multi- and hyper- spectral optical sensors. The correspondence analysis on analyzed variables exhibited that aircrafts with high spatial resolution (<3 m) with optical sensors (λ = 400 to 2500 nm) seem to be the most optimum combination to target marine litter, while satellites carrying Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensors (λ = 3.1 to 5.6 cm) may detect sea-slicks associated to surfactants that might contain high concentration of microplastics. Gaps indicate that future goals in marine litter detection should be addressed with platforms including optical and SAR sensors.","SAR,Remote sensing,Sea-slicks,Marine plastic litter,Optical sensors,"

"comparison of ship detection algorithms using alos-palsar, ground-based maritime radar, and ais","2011","MLCC (Multi-Look Cross-Correlation) is a useful technique to extract the images of ships embedded in sea clutter from SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) data. However, the previous MLCC has a difficulty of detecting small ships since SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio) is not high enough. Therefore, we developed a new Improved MLCC (IMLCC) to increase SNR to extract small boats. Although the IMLCC method increased SNR, there still remained some highly correlated noises in the coherence images caused by strong radar backscatter from sea surface. In order to improve the IMLCC algorithm further, we propose a new method of applying Lognormal-CFAR (Constant False Alarm Rate) to IMLCC coherence images.

"small maritime target detection using gradient vector field characterization of infrared image","2023","Infrared small maritime target detection under strong ocean waves, a challenging task, plays a key role in maritime distress target search and rescue applications. Many methods based on directionality or gradient properties have proven to perform well for infrared images with heterogeneous scenarios. However, they tend to perform poorly when facing strong ocean wave background, mainly due to the following: 1) infrared images have low signal-to-clutter ratio with low intensity for small targets; 2) some waves have high local contrast that may be similar to or higher than targets. To solve these issues, a new method based on gradient vector field characterization (GVFC) of infrared images is proposed. First, we construct the gradient vector field and coarsely extract suspected targets. Then, gradient vector distribution measure (GVDM) is presented, which comprehensively integrates a synergistic homogeneity test based on Kolmogorovâ€“Smirnov test with absolute difference standard deviation for gradient direction angle and regression analysis for gradient modulus. The proposed GVDM takes advantage of pixel-level gradient distribution property to further filtrate refined suspected targets. Moreover, gradient modulus horizontal local dissimilarity is proposed to measure the diversity of gradient modulus in horizontal direction between targets and waves, so as to enhance target saliency and suppress residual clutter simultaneously, which achieves preferable performance. Finally, a simple adaptive threshold is applied to confirm targets. Extensive experiments implemented on infrared maritime images with strong ocean waves demonstrate that the proposed method is superior to the state-of-the-art methods with respect to robustness and detection accuracy.","gradient vector distribution measure,pixel-level gradient distribution property,rescue applications,maritime target detection,radar clutter,strong ocean wave background,strong ocean waves,infrared maritime image,Sea measurements,gradient direction angle,regression analysis,gradient vector field characterization,Ocean waves,ocean waves,Target tracking,object detection,Sparse matrices,feature extraction,target saliency,small target detection,infrared image,suppress residual clutter,infrared maritime images,suspected targets,infrared imaging,maritime distress target search,Tensors,Clutter,Object detection,gradient modulus horizontal local dissimilarity,low signal-to-clutter ratio,vertical local dissimilarity,image segmentation,Gradient vector,"
"a comprehensive maritime benchmark dataset for detection, tracking and threat recognition","2021","This paper describes a new multimodal maritime dataset recorded using a multispectral suite of sensors, including AIS, GPS, radar, and visible and thermal cameras. The visible and thermal cameras are mounted on the vessel itself and surveillance is performed around the vessel in order to protect it from piracy at sea. The dataset corresponds to a series of acted scenarios which simulate attacks to the vessel by small, fast-moving boats (â€˜skiffsâ€™). The scenarios are inspired by real piracy incidents at sea and present a range of technical challenges to the different stages in an automated surveillance system: object detection, object tracking, and event recognition (in this case, threats towards the vessel). The dataset can thus be employed for training and testing at several stages of a threat detection and classification system. We also present in this paper baseline results that can be used for benchmarking algorithms performing such tasks.

"bistatic sar maritime ship target 3-d image reconstruction method without distortion in local cartesian coordinate","2023","Bistatic synthetic aperture radar (BiSAR) has been attracting worldwide attention because of its forward-looking imaging and high anti-interference. In harsh environment, it is vital for BiSAR to conduct extensive surveillance, imaging, and recognition of maritime ship targets. However, under the disturbance of sea waves, the ship target has an unknown and massive 3-D rotation, so that its imaging projection plane (IPP) is also undetermined. Thus, high-dimensional random distortion appears in imaging results, making it difficult to recognize the target through 2-D distorted images effectively. To solve these problems, BiSAR maritime ship target 3-D image reconstruction method without distortion in local Cartesian coordinate (LCC) is proposed. In this article, according to positions of scatterers and rotation parameters, significant differences of different scatterers of maritime ship targets have been found in bistatic range, Doppler centroid (DC), and Doppler frequency rate (DFR), which lays a solid foundation for the scatterer separation of ship targets. On this basis, a 3-D R-DC-DFR domain is constructed, and 2-D echoes of the maritime ship target are projected into R-DC-DFR domain to separate scatterers. Then, by remapping data of transmitter and receiver in R-DC-DFR domain to LCC, as well as evaluating their similarity metric, the optimal rotation parameters of the ship target can be obtained via the maximal similarity. Therefore, the image distortion caused by the unknown IPP has been removed, and 3-D image reconstruction of ship targets can be realized without distortion in the LCC. Furthermore, to evaluate performances of 3-D image reconstruction for different rotation parameters and bistatic configurations, 3-D reconstruction index is proposed and analyzed. Both point-targets and maritime ship targets are simulated to emphasize the effectiveness of the proposed method.","local Cartesian coordinate,bistatic synthetic aperture radar (BiSAR),marine radar,R-DC-DFR domain,Image reconstruction,maritime ship target,Marine vehicles,bistatic SAR maritime ship target 3-D image reconstruction method,high-dimensional random distortion,Transmitters,Synthetic aperture radar,geophysical image processing,3-D reconstruction,ships,synthetic aperture radar,image distortion,image reconstruction,radar imaging,Doppler effect,BiSAR maritime ship target,2-D distorted images,imaging projection plane,Receivers,Imaging,point-targets,remote sensing by radar,local Cartesian coordinate (LCC),oceanographic techniques,"

"mining vessel tracking data for maritime domain applications","2016","The growing number of remote sensing systems and ship reporting technologies (e.g. Automatic Identification System, Long Range Identification and Tracking, radar tracking, Earth Observation) are generating an overwhelming amount of spatio-temporal and geographically distributed data related to vessels and their movements. Research on reliable data mining techniques has proven essential to the discovery of knowledge from such increasingly available information on ship traffic at sea. Data driven knowledge discovery has very recently demonstrated its value in fields that go beyond the original maritime safety and security remits of such data. They include, but are not limited to, fisheries management, maritime spatial planning, gridding ship emissions, mapping activities at sea, risk assessment of offshore platforms, and trade indicators. The extraction of useful information from maritime Big Data is thus a key element in providing operational authorities, policy-makers and scientists with supporting tools to understand what is happening at sea and improve maritime knowledge.

"improving sar wind retrieval through automatic anomalous pixel detection","2023","Satellite observations are increasingly in demand and valuable for monitoring the ocean and coastal winds in near-real-time and analyzing the data historically. However, soared up human activities, man-made constructions, and marine traffics negatively interfere and affect the reliability of observations and raise concerns about the trustworthiness of using satellite winds for many applications, such as offshore wind energy, even though Sentinel synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data is freely and easily accessible. In this paper, we presented a novel methodological framework for localization and suppression of anomalous pixels (APs), which deteriorate the confidence and accuracy of the retrieved SAR wind speeds. The backbone of the implementation relied on the constant false alarm rate (CFAR) algorithm, one of the automatic target recognition algorithms. We used a large dataset of SAR subscenes to model different sea clutter conditions after removing the potential targets. We selected the suitable distribution model that maintains a constant probability of false alarm (pfa) for the entire SAR scene. The proper pfa was optimized in various SAR scenes ranging from scenes with a considerable number of APs, such as ships and wind park clusters, to scenes with no visible APs under different wind speed conditions. The pfa optimization process prevented real wind pixels from being misidentified as APs. Applying CFAR to the logarithmic scale of raw digital numbers (log-DNs) domain with a pfa of about 3.17 × 10-5, we extracted SAR wind speeds around each ocean buoy before and after CFAR process, comparing them with their corresponding in situ wind measurements. This led to significant improvement in the quality and accuracy of SAR wind data retrieval, especially in regions with numerous man-made constructions and high marine traffics. We tested and validated our approach in the North Sea and two regions along the eastern coast of the U.S. The enclosed region, serving as a marine route for harbors in Delaware Bay, showed a substantial improvement in RMSE and BIAS after applying our approach, reducing RMSE from 2.4 m/s to 1.6 m/s and the BIAS from −1.5 m/s to −0.3 m/s. The open ocean region demonstrated stable RMSE and BIAS, indicating preservation of real wind data, as only APs affecting SAR wind speed were considered during the process.","Offshore wind farm,SAR,Sentinel-1,CFAR,Anomalous pixel,Coastal environment,"

"vessel detection and classification from spaceborne optical images: a literature survey","2018","This paper provides an overview of existing literature on vessel/ship detection and classification from optical satellite imagery. Although SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) is still the leading technology for maritime monitoring, the number of studies based on optical satellite data is quickly growing. Altogether we analysed 119 papers on optical vessel detection and classification for the period from 1978 to March 2017. We start by introducing all the existing sensor systems for vessel detection, but subsequently focus only on optical imaging satellites. The article demonstrates the temporal development of optical satellite characteristics and connects this to the number and frequency of publications on vessel detection. After presenting the methods used for optical imagery-based vessel detection and classification in detail, along with the achieved detection accuracies, we also report possibilities for fusing optical data with other data sources. The studied papers show that the most common factors greatly influencing the vessel detection accuracy are the following: different weather conditions affecting sea surface characteristics, the quantity of clouds and haze, solar angle, and imaging sensor characteristics. All these factors bring great variations in the selection of the most suitable method; some still continue to pose unsolved challenges. For higher relevance and wider usage, we suggest that the algorithms for detection and classification should support a variety of targets and meteorological conditions, and ideally also a variety of optical satellite sensors. At least, they should be tested on many images under different conditions. This is not usually the case in the existent literature. We also observed that many authors omit an appropriate performance quantification, which is critical for a practical assessment and a numerical comparison of the presented algorithms. Overall it can be seen that vessel monitoring from spaceborne optical images is a popular research topic and has a great operational potential in the near future due to the large amount of satellite data, much of it free and open.","Ship detection,Sea target detection,Ship classification,Maritime domain awareness,Object recognition,Vessel classification,Optical satellite data,Vessel detection,"
"a drone-based multisensory payload for maritime pollutants detections","2023","Surface floating marine pollution is responsible for a wide range of environmental hazards for marine fauna. Surface sea pollution monitoring is usually carried out by visual inspection from aircrafts or ships. However, human inspection is costly and results can vary from observer to observer. Remote sensing technology is a valid alternative to in situ measurements that can reduce costs and risks compared to in situ missions. In this context, aerial platforms provide a convenient tradeoff between coverage and resolution, both spatial and temporal, compared to ship or satellite based surveys. As well, small, unmanned aircrafts have the potential to be very inexpensive to operate, offer more flexibility of operation, and will benefit from active research on reducing size, weight, and power (SWAP) requirements of various sensors.

"chapter 5 - oil spill remote sensing","2017","Remotesensing for oil spills is reviewed. The technical aspects of sensors are summarized and the benefits and limitations of each sensor are given. The use of visible techniques is ubiquitous; however, it gives only the same results as visible monitoring. Oil has no particular spectral features that would allow for identification among the many possible background interferences. Identification of specific oil types is not possible. Cameras are useful to provide documentation. Infrared (IR) offers some potential as an oil spill sensor. In daytime oil absorbs light and remits a portion of this as thermal energy at temperatures 3–4K above ambient. IR cameras are economical; however, they suffer from problems such as the inability to discriminate oil from interferences on beaches, among weeds, debris or sediment, and under certain lighting conditions. Furthermore, water-in-oil emulsions may not be detected in the infrared, depending on light and sea conditions. The laser fluorosensor is a useful instrument because of its unique capability to identify oil on backgrounds that include water, soil, weeds, ice, and snow. It is the only sensor that can positively discriminate oil on most backgrounds. The laser fluorosensor also allows for positive identification and discrimination between oil types. Radar detects oil on water because oil dampens water-surface capillary waves under low to moderate wave/wind conditions. Radar offers the only potential for large area searches, day/night and foul weather remote sensing. False targets can be as high as 95%. Satellite-borne radar sensors are now extensively used for mapping large spills or assisting in ship and platform discharge monitoring. The only commercial equipment that measures slick thickness is passive microwave.","Oil spill remote sensing,Oil detection,Sensors for oil,"

"object detection based on multi-sensor proposal fusion in maritime environment","2018","In this paper, we propose an effective object detection framework based on proposal fusion of multiple sensors such as infrared camera, RGB cameras, radar and LiDAR. Our framework first applies the Selective Search (SS) method on RGB image data to extract possible candidate proposals which likely contain the objects of interest. Then it uses the information from other sensors in order to reduce the number of generated proposals by SS and find more dense proposals. Finally, the class of objects within the final proposals are identified by Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Experimental results on real dataset demonstrate that our framework can precisely detect meaningful object regions using a smaller number of proposals than other object proposals methods.

"gnss-based passive radar for maritime surveillance: long integration time mti technique","2017","The exploitation of the Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) as transmitters of opportunity in passive radar systems for maritime surveillance is particularly attractive because of the main advantages consisting in a global coverage (even in open sea) and in the availability of multiple sources (different satellites and constellations). The main drawback stays in the restricted power budget provided by navigation satellites. This makes necessary to conceive, define and develop innovative moving target detection techniques specifically tailored for the system under consideration, in order to make this technology a powerful tool for persistent surveillance of sea areas of interest. To this aim, a long integration time Maritime Moving Target Indication technique is proposed in this work, and its effectiveness is proved against experimental data involving a small maritime target, not detectable by conventional MTI techniques.

"sar and ais fusion for maritime surveillance","2018","This paper presents a novel approach to fuse Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images and Automatic Identification System (AIS) data for maritime surveillance. The procedure consists of four steps. First, ship detection is performed in the SAR image using a Constant False Alarm Rate (CFAR) algorithm; then feature extraction (ship position, heading and size) is performed on ships detected in the SAR image, the third step consists in identifying the detected ships and extracting the same features from the AIS data. The final step is to feed the fusion block with both features vectors extracted separately from the SAR and AIS. Here the arithmetic mean function is established.

"lda-mig detectors for maritime targets in nonhomogeneous sea clutter","2023","This article deals with the problem of detecting maritime targets embedded in nonhomogeneous sea clutter, where the limited number of secondary data is available due to the heterogeneity of sea clutter. A class of linear discriminant analysis (LDA)-based matrix information geometry (MIG) detectors is proposed in the supervised scenario. As customary, Hermitian positive-definite (HPD) matrices are used to model the observational sample data, and the clutter covariance matrix of the received dataset is estimated as the geometric mean of the secondary HPD matrices. Given a set of training HPD matrices with class labels, which are elements of a higher dimensional HPD matrix manifold, the LDA manifold projection learns a mapping from the higher dimensional HPD matrix manifold to a lower dimensional one subject to maximum discrimination. In this study, the LDA manifold projection, with the cost function maximizing between-class distance while minimizing within-class distance, is formulated as an optimization problem in the Stiefel manifold. Four robust LDA-MIG detectors corresponding to different geometric measures are proposed. Numerical results based on both simulated radar clutter with interferences and real IPIX radar data show the advantage of the proposed LDA-MIG detectors against their counterparts without using LDA and the state-of-the-art maritime target detection methods in nonhomogeneous sea clutter.","linear discriminant analysis,covariance matrices,geometry,marine radar,secondary HPD matrices,Hermitian positive-definite (HPD) manifold,matrix information geometry (MIG) detectors,radar detection,target detection,radar clutter,Sea measurements,Covariance matrices,simulated radar clutter,Manifolds,Data models,object detection,optimisation,LDA manifold projection,maritime targets,within-class distance,between-class distance,Hermitian positive-definite matrices,matrix information geometry detectors,robust LDA-MIG detectors,clutter,class labels,nonhomogeneous sea clutter,linear discriminant analysis (LDA),Training,higher dimensional HPD matrix manifold,Clutter,observational sample data,clutter covariance matrix,geophysical signal processing,training HPD matrices,learning (artificial intelligence),remote sensing by radar,Detectors,secondary data,oceanographic techniques,"

This paper proposes a data-driven approach to anomaly detection, highlighting challenges specific to the maritime domain. This work builds on unsupervised learning techniques which provide models for normal traffic behaviour. A methodology to associate tracks to the derived traffic model is then presented. This is done by the pre-extraction of contextual information as the baseline patterns of life (i.e., routes) in the area under investigation. In addition to a brief description of the approach to derive the routes, their characterization and representation is presented in support of exploitable knowledge to classify anomalies. A hierarchical reasoning is proposed where new tracks are first associated to existing routes based on their positional information only and â€œoff-routeâ€ vesselsâ€ are detected. Then, for on-route vessels further anomalies are detected such as â€œspeed anomalyâ€ or â€œheading anomalyâ€.

"seaâ€“land segmentation in maritime surveillance radars via k-nearest neighbor classifier","2020","Shipborne or airborne maritime surveillance radars at scan mode work at a complex scene consisting of land, sea, and islands. Sea-land segmentation provides a two-class classification of sea clutter versus ground clutter to the surveillance scene as a precondition of adaptive target detection. It is a difficult problem because only a few coherent pulses are available at scan mode. Moreover, due to moving radar platforms and wide dynamic range of ground and sea clutter in power, average amplitude, Doppler offset, and initial phase of radar, the returns vector fails to distinguish sea clutter and ground clutter. In this article, a similarity measure of two radar returns vectors, which is invariant to amplitude, Doppler offset, and initial phase, is constructed, which is closely relevant to the Doppler bandwidth of a returns vector. Based on the similarity measure, a K-nearest neighbor classifier is proposed to yield a pixel-level sea-land segmentation of the scene. Further, the morphological filtering is operated on the pixel-level segmentation to obtain a region-level segmentation. Moreover, the discrete FrÃ©chet distances of the main boundaries in successive scan periods are used to assess segmentation quality. The proposed method is verified by measured data from an airborne radar and an island-based radar. The results show that it behaves better than the methods using thresholding phase linearity degree of radar returns and the support vector machine, and back propagation neural network in a three-dimensional feature space.","airborne radar,K-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier,region-level segmentation,K-nearest neighbor classifier,radar platforms,seaâ€“land segmentation,marine radar,island-based radar,K,Radar antennas,radar detection,complex scene,radar clutter,pixel-level sea-land segmentation,returns vector,ground clutter,pixel-level segmentation,scan mode work,sea clutter,geophysical image processing,support vector machines,similarity measure,object detection,feature extraction,search radar,radar imaging,Doppler effect,Radar clutter,Doppler,Doppler bandwidth,Doppler radar,Clutter,Discrete FrÃ©chet distance,surveillance scene,airborne maritime surveillance radars,radar returns vectors,morphological filter,Surveillance,image segmentation,remote sensing by radar,segmentation quality,oceanographic techniques,"

The traditional approach to radar data processing is to first detect targets using their amplitude information (by comparing the radar returns to a suitably chosen threshold) and then feed the extracted (point) measurements into a target tracking system. An alternative approach which can be exploited to improve tracking of weak targets is to process the raw radar data directly though use of a track before detect (TBD) algorithm.

"sensor information fusion architecture for virtual maritime environment","2012","This paper presents a ongoing research on generic sensor fusion architecture and its application to a maritime surveillance system. The importance of information fusion for various sensor types and specialized sensor fusion systems in various domains are discussed. In sensor fusion, centralized versus decentralized refers to where the fusion of the data occurs. In centralized fusion, the clients simply forward all of the data to a central location, and some entity at the central location is responsible for correlating and fusing the data. In this research we intend to correlate multiple maritime sensors such as RADAR, AIS, and other electronic object detection systems. Sri Lanka Navy has myriad of surveillance information sources such as AIS (Automatic Identification System), RADAR (Radio Aid Detection and Ranging), SONAR (Sound Navigation and Ranging), MSTT, HFSWR, AVL (Automatic Vessel Locating), HF Communication, Intelligence Data ect. So it is obvious that an information fusion methodology is needed to harness the effectiveness of multiple sensor information. An object identification pipeline is conceptualized such that an unknown object in the maritime domain is detected reducing the uncertainty of obtained information. The radical new virtual reality application has been developed to visualize the information fused from sensors and discussed in depth in addition to the introduction of the fusion process.

"location estimation in a maritime environment using a monocular camera","2014","Maritime surveillance is a very important task in coastal areas, especially in harbour environments. The most popular such systems include components like Automatic Identification System (AIS) and Radar. Camera based visual surveillance can be used as an alternative to these systems in order to overcome the lacking features of them. Sea surface object detection and identification is a major need for such visual surveillance systems. Most of the current visual surveillance systems don't have the ability of identifying vessels in real time. A vessel can be identified using information from other systems, if the location of the vessel is identified. Location estimation of sea surface objects is mainly explored in this research. Video stream from a single geo stationary camera is used as the input; however camera properties are not used for any calculation. Mainly two distance measurements are considered and different approaches for estimating the distances are explored. Neural network approach gave considerably accurate results in vertical distance estimation and it was found that the shortest distance from camera to the object can be measured best using B-spline 3D curve fitting. Data taken from AIS is used for fitting curves and training neural network. After calculating distances, latitudes and longitudes are calculated. An evaluation has been done comparing the calculated values and the values obtained from AIS data using various statistical tests. There, the different approaches are compared and accuracy levels are described. Vessel identification is done comparing the estimated location and the available location information from AIS data.","sea surface object detection,vessel identification,distance measurement,marine navigation,Global Positioning System,statistical test,splines (mathematics),geostationary camera,Maritime,video stream,Distance Estimation,neural nets,monocular camera,ships,maritime surveillance,B-spline 3D curve fitting,object detection,location estimation,sea surface object identification,vertical distance estimation,curve fitting,maritime environment,neural network approach,video surveillance,Monocular Vision,Location Estimation,camera based visual surveillance,"
"belief modeling for maritime surveillance","2009","In maritime surveillance, the volume of information to be processed is very large and there is a great deal of uncertainty about the data. There are many vessels at sea at every point in time, and the vast majority of them pose no threat to security. Sifting through all of the benign activity to find unusual activities is a difficult problem. The problem is made even more difficult by the fact that the available data about vessel activities is both incomplete and inconsistent. In order to manage this uncertainty, automated anomaly detection software can be very useful in the early detection of threats to security. This paper introduces a high-level architecture for an anomaly detection system based on a formal model of beliefs with respect to each entity in some domain of interest. In this framework, the system has beliefs about the intentions of each vessel in the maritime domain. If the vessel behaves in an unexpected manner, these intentions are revised and a human operations centre worker is notified. This approach is flexible, scalable, and easily manages inconsistent information. Moreover, the approach has the pragmatic advantage that it uses expert information to inform decision making, but the required information is easily obtained through simple ranking exercises.","surveillance,Anomaly detection,automated anomaly detection software,Marine vehicles,Monitoring,security of data,Decision making,Information security,data uncertainty,belief modeling,Application software,marine engineering,maritime surveillance,Humans,Radar tracking,decision making,high-level architecture,belief revision,Uncertainty,Surveillance,Data security,"

"shipping and ship recycling related oil pollution detection in çandarlı bay (turkey) using satellite monitoring","2019","Çandarlı Bay is a marine environment at risk of heavy pollution because of industrial facilities including the only ship recycling zone of Turkey, and intense marine traffic related to the raw materials needs of a dense industrial zone. These risk factors make the development of practical environmental management strategies increasingly necessary. Oil spills from the heavy ship traffic, one of the major risks, can be detected by satellite remote sensing technologies. In this study, it is aimed to show spatial characteristics of oil spills as well as its dynamics in the time domain of the bay. Results from a three year period of the study show that as a main environmental problem, oil pollution has a relatively high percentage of spatial distribution in the bay. It is therefore concluded that regular monitoring of the intense oil pollution in the bay is required with an agile and low-cost method of satellite monitoring to intervene in good time and to minimize its impacts. The study provided an extensive understanding of spatio-temporal dynamics of oil pollution in the bay. The approach used will also provide a baseline for decision-makers to develop environmental management plans for other coastal zones with similar sensitivities.","The synthetic radar monitoring (SAR),Ship recycling,Spatio-temporal analysis,Çandarlı Bay (Turkey),Oil pollution from ships,"

"ship behavior recognition based on infrared video analysis in a maritime environment","2015","In order to improve the monitoring capability of officer on watch for the environment around the own ship, cover the shortage of RADAR and AIS in ship behavior recognition field, this paper proposes a ship behavior recognition algorithm based on video analysis. After analyzing the ship behavior we found that the silhouette's size and shape variation of ship in infrared image were related to its behavior over a period of time, that is to say when the distance between the own ship and the target ship has decreased during this period, its silhouette's size would increase. And when the target ship is heading toward the own ship directly and the distance between them has decreased (the DCPA (Distance to Closest Point of Approach) is very small, and the TCPA (Time to Closest Point of Approach) is decreasing), the silhouette's size of the target ship would enlarge, nevertheless, its silhouette's shape would have no significant changes. According to these characteristics of ship behavior, the height of target ship's silhouette is used to represent silhouette's size and the ratio between the width and the height of the target ship's silhouette is used to represent silhouette's shape in the ship behavior recognition algorithm we proposed. And then the least square method is used to fit the height and the ratio into straight line during this period respectively, whose slope reflects the changing trend and variation of target ship's silhouette. At last, the recognition algorithm was verified by analyzing infrared video in a maritime environment, which shows that the characteristic of ship behavior summarized by this paper is correct and the recognition algorithm based on them is feasible.","Time to Closest Point of Approach,Cameras,Marine vehicles,Character recognition,intelligent recognition,ship behavior,Target recognition,ships,maritime surveillance,Image recognition,DCPA,Shape,least squares approximations,video analysis,Radar,infrared image,target ship,video signal processing,ship behavior recognition algorithm,TCPA,infrared imaging,maritime environment,marine communication,least square method,infrared video,Distance to Closest Point of Approach,object recognition,"

"video processing from electro-optical sensors for object detection and tracking in a maritime environment: a survey","2017","We present a survey on maritime object detection and tracking approaches, which are essential for the development of a navigational system for autonomous ships. The electro-optical (EO) sensor considered here is a video camera that operates in the visible or the infrared spectra, which conventionally complements radar and sonar for situational awareness at sea and has demonstrated its effectiveness over the last few years. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of various approaches of video processing for object detection and tracking in the maritime environment. We follow an approach-based taxonomy wherein the advantages and limitations of each approach are compared. The object detection system consists of the following modules: horizon detection, static background subtraction, and foreground segmentation. Each of these has been studied extensively in maritime situations and has been shown to be challenging due to the presence of background motion especially due to waves and wakes. The key processes involved in object tracking include video frame registration, dynamic background subtraction, and the object tracking algorithm itself. The challenges for robust tracking arise due to camera motion, dynamic background, and low contrast of tracked object, possibly due to environmental degradation. The survey also discusses multisensor approaches and commercial maritime systems that use EO sensors. The survey also highlights methods from computer vision research, which hold promise to perform well in maritime EO data processing.

"tracing illegal oil discharges from vessels using sar and ais in bohai sea of china","2021","In China's 14th Five-Year Plan, it is necessary to coordinate the promotion of marine ecological protection and prevent environmental risks such as marine oil spills. The illegal discharge of oily waste from ships is an important source of oil spill pollution in the Bohai Sea, and has become an important factor hindering the purification of the marine environment. Because SAR remote sensing is not restricted by light conditions, it can work at night, in heavy fog, overcast and rainy days, and has become one of the important techniques for monitoring oil spills on the sea. AIS can provide real-time and historical position and track information of ships. The combination of SAR and AIS can provide a great help for maritime regulatory authorities to find the source of oil spill pollution. However, China has not yet established a mature and effective oil spill supervision system based on SAR and AIS. This paper proposes a framework for oil spill detection and accountability using the combination of SAR, AIS and boarding inspection, and takes an example of the monitoring and tracking process of illegal oil discharge from a ship in the Bohai Sea. As far as we know, this is the first time that China has used SAR and AIS to identify ships that illegally discharge oily sewage. This work framework can provide a reference for China's maritime agencies to improve the oil spill supervision system during the 14th Five-Year Plan.","Synthetic aperture radar,Illegal discharge,Automatic identification system,Oil spill,"

"a fast sar image position algorithm for maritime target location","2016","In order to find the maritime targets location in SAR image accurately, a fast R-D algorithm is introduced in this paper and it can solve targets location problems which are in the sea area. The real latitude and longitude coordinates measure system and geographical coordinates are built up for SAR image, then the targets located in the sea can be point out. First, based on information in SAR satellite data headers the Doppler center frequency coefficients can be calculated. Then the parameters are carried in the R-D pattern for calculate four vertex coordinates of SAR image. Generally the solution of R-D pattern is an iterative process, here a fast algorithm is proposed which combined with slope distance, Doppler parameters and earth model to reduce variables, then and the position of SAR is calculated and the latitude and longitude coordinates of target is also obtained. Second, the SAR image geocoding can be made up and the target in SAR image over sea can be found out. Finally, compare these results with AIS data, the accuracy of location is analyzed. The result shows that the deviation of distance location is less than 200 meters, and the deviation of azimuth is less than 6'. The error is reasonable for real application.

"maritime small target detection based on appearance stability and depth-normalized motion saliency in infrared video with dense sunglints","2023","Maritime infrared (IR) small target detection in dense sunglint environments has always been challenging. It is difficult for existing methods to distinguish the small target from dense and strong sea clutter because the sea clutter caused by the sunglints has similar spatialâ€“temporal characteristics to small targets. This article proposes a method based on appearance stability and depth-normalized motion saliency (AS-DNMS) for small target detection in IR videos or sequences. First, on each frame of the IR video, the isotropic salience measure (ISM) based on principal curvature filtering is proposed for target enhancement, and an adaptive threshold is used to extract a stable number of candidate targets. Then, we use improved pipeline filtering to form trajectory chains of the candidate targets extracted from the consecutive frames. To improve the matching accuracy of pipeline filtering, we propose an inverse optical flow method to predict the local images of the candidate targets. Third, the motion vectors of the candidate targets are extracted and depth-normalized. According to the principle of projection perspective, a depth normalization model based on the position of the sea-sky line is established, providing a simple and low-cost solution for acquiring depth information of maritime targets under sea-sky backgrounds. Finally, the appearance stability measure (ASM) and the depth-normalized motion saliency measure (DNMSM) are calculated to construct the AS-DNMS joint feature. A double asymptote decision function is employed to determine the real target. The experimental results show that our method has better detection performance in dense sunglint environments than the baseline methods.","Appearance stability and depth-normalized motion saliency (AS-DNMS),Pipelines,target detection,radar clutter,target enhancement,Sea measurements,IR video,dense sunglint environment,strong sea clutter,isotropic salience measure (ISM),object detection,dense sunglints,feature extraction,maritime targets,Sea surface,improved pipeline filtering,infrared (IR) small target detection,depth-normalized motion saliency measure,dense sunglint environments,depth normalization model,Trajectory,image sequences,Tensors,Clutter,Object detection,appearance stability measure,infrared video,sequences,candidate targets,sea-sky line,isotropic salience measure,pipeline filtering,dense sea clutter,"
"sa-hpmht for maritime dim targets tracking with sensor location uncertainty","2023","To address the problem of tracking low signal-to-clutter ratio (SCR) maritime targets with sensor location uncertainty, an effective track-before-detect (TBD) method, called the state augmentation histogram probabilistic multihypothesis tracking (SA-HPMHT) algorithm, is proposed in this article. In this algorithm, the initialization of new tracks is realized based on the constant false alarm rate (CFAR) detector with a low threshold and the  ${K}$ -means clustering algorithm. The target and sensor states are then simultaneously estimated in an iterative manner via a synthetic histogram and state augmentation (SA) method. In each iteration, we update the estimated sensor state and yield more accurate measured images, allowing for improved performance of detection and tracking targets. Finally, an  ${M}/{N}$  logic technology is invoked to confirm or terminate the tracks.

"grid size optimization for potential field based maritime anomaly detection","2014","This study focuses on improving the potential field based maritime data modeling method, developed to extract traffic patterns and detect anomalies, in a clear, understandable and informative way. The method's novelty lies in employing the concept of a potential field for AIS vessel tracking data abstraction and maritime traffic representation. Unlike the traditional maritime surveillance equipment, such as radar or GPS, the AIS system comprehensively represents the identity and properties of a vessel, as well as its behavior, thus preserving the effects of navigational decisions, based on the skills of experienced seamen. In the developed data modeling process, every vessel generates potential charges, which value represent the vessel's behavior, and drops the charges at locations it passes. Each AIS report is used to assign a potential charge at the reported vessel positions. The method derives three construction elements, which define, firstly, how charges are accumulated, secondly, how a charge decays over time, and thirdly, in what way the potential is distributed around the source charge. The collection of potential fields represents a model of normal behavior, and vessels not conforming to it are marked as anomalous. In the anomaly detection prototype system STRAND, the sensitivity of anomaly detection can be modified by setting a geographical coordinate grid precision to more dense or coarse. The objective of this study is to identify the optimal grid size for two different conditions – an open sea and a port area case. A noticeable shift can be observed between the results for the open sea and the port area. The plotted detection rates converge towards an optimal ratio for smaller grid sizes in the port area (60-200 meters), than in the open sea case (300-1000 meters). The effective outcome of the potential filed based anomaly detection is filtering out all vessels behaving normally and presenting a set of anomalies, for a subsequent incident analysis using STRAND as an information visualization tool.","maritime traffic,potential field,anomaly detection,AIS,"

"an integrated maritime surveillance system based on high-frequency surface-wave radars. 2. operational status and system performance","2001","For pt.1 see ibid., vol.43, no.4, p.28-43 (2001). An integrated maritime surveillance (IMS) system, based on high-frequency surface wave radars (HFSWR), for monitoring surface and low-level air activity within the 200 nautical mile (nm) Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) is described in this two-part paper. The science behind the long-range performance of HFSWR was presented in Part 1(Sevgi et al. 2001). The system described was installed on Canada's east coast, where it is being used to demonstrate continuous, all-weather surveillance of the EEZ to beyond 200 nm. The system consists of two land-based HFSWRs and an operations control center (OCC). The two unmanned radars provide coverage of the Grand Banks region of Newfoundland, renowned for its offshore resources, particularly fish and oil. The system has been designed to assist authorities to more efficiently monitor such illegal activities as drug trafficking, smuggling, piracy, illicit fishing and illegal immigration. In addition, the system may be used for tracking icebergs, environmental protection, search and rescue, resource protection, sovereignty monitoring, and remote sensing of ocean surface currents and winds.

"detecting anomalous deviations from standard maritime routes using the ornsteinâ€“uhlenbeck process","2018","A novel anomaly detection procedure based on the Ornsteinâ€“Uhlenbeck (OU) mean-reverting stochastic process is presented. The considered anomaly is a vessel that deviates from a planned route, changing its nominal velocity $\boldsymbol{v}_0$. In order to hide this behavior, the vessel switches off its automatic identification system (AIS) device for a time  $T$ and then tries to revert to the previous nominal velocity $\boldsymbol{v}_0$. The decision that has to be made is declaring that a deviation either happened or not, relying only upon two consecutive AIS contacts. Furthermore, the extension to the scenario in which multiple contacts (e.g., radar) are available during the time period $T$ is also considered. A proper statistical hypothesis testing procedure that builds on the changes in the OU process long-term velocity parameter $\boldsymbol{v}_0$ of the vessel is the core of the proposed approach and enables the solution of the anomaly detection problem.

"wald- and rao-based detection for maritime radar targets in sea clutter with lognormal texture","2022","Non-Gaussian sea clutter causes conventional detectors designed in Gaussian clutter to suffer detection performance degradation, and some nuisance parameters cause the uniformly most powerful test to be unavailable. To improve the detection performance of maritime radar targets, we investigate the design of adaptive detectors in correlated non-Gaussian sea clutter by using suboptimal tests. The non-Gaussian sea clutter is modeled as a product of lognormal-distributed texture and complex Gaussian speckle. Two adaptive radar target detectors are developed by using the suboptimal two-step Wald and Rao tests. Specifically, a nonadaptive detector is derived by the Wald or Rao test when the clutter texture and speckle covariance matrix are assumed to be known in the first step; then the clutter parameters known in the first step are estimated, and the true parameters of the detector obtained in the first step are replaced with the estimated values. Theoretical proof and experimental verification indicate that the two proposed detectors have the constant false alarm property with regard to the clutter speckle covariance matrix and the clutter average power. Numerical results on simulated and measured radar data show that the proposed Rao-based detector outperforms its competitors and has stronger robustness to the signal mismatch compared to the proposed Wald-based detector.","Wald-based detector,covariance matrices,speckle,marine radar,detection performance degradation,complex Gaussian speckle,Wald test,radar detection,Lognormal texture,radar clutter,clutter texture,Gaussian clutter,adaptive radar,clutter speckle covariance matrix,sea clutter,adaptive detectors,radar targets,Covariance matrices,object detection,adaptive radar target detectors,Rao-based detector,maritime radar targets,Radar clutter,Radar,radar signal processing,clutter average power,Gaussian noise,Clutter,clutter parameters,nonGaussian sea clutter,Rao-based detection,Rao test,Gaussian distribution,Radar detection,Detectors,NonGaussian sea clutter,Speckle,"
"onboard processing concept for maritime surveillance demonstrated with dlrâ€™s airborne radar sensors f-sar and dbfsar","2021","In the paper an onboard processing concept for maritime surveillance applications is proposed. It is suited for airborne platforms and future high-altitude platforms (HAP).

Small coherent processing intervals (CPIs) are used for detecting and tracking the ships in range-Doppler domain. In addition to the reduced processing requirements, the range-Doppler domain has the advantage that even ships with small radar cross section (RCS) can be detected when they move with a certain line-of-sight velocity so that their signals are shifted in Doppler to the exo-clutter region. In the paper the overall processing concept is briefly discussed and the effectiveness is demonstrated by using real radar data acquired with DLRâ€™s airborne radar sensors F-SAR [1] and DBFSAR [2].",""
"siamfpn: a deep learning method for accurate and real-time maritime ship tracking","2021","Visual object tracking plays an essential role in various maritime applications. However, most of the existing tracking methods belong to generative models, which only focus on the features of the object and require the target has significant visual saliency for accurate tracking. While the visual saliency is available in most of the common tracking conditions, these methods may fail when facing challenging situations. In this paper, a deep learning based tracking method is proposed to track maritime ships, namely, SiamFPN. In SiamFPN, a modified Siamese Network is combined with multi-RPNs to build a tracking pipeline. Concretely, A ResNet-50 with an FPN structure is used as the CNN of the detection subnetwork of Siamese, and a template subnetwork is parallel to the detection. In order to strengthen the discriminative ability, three RPNs are deployed to process the output of Siamese Network. Moreover, a historical impacts based proposal selection method is developed for selecting correct target areas.

"a stap detection scheme for low sample support maritime environments","2023","In airborne radar, reduced rank space-time adaptive processing techniques are employed when non-stationarity and non-homogeneity of the clutter causes insufficient sample support. There have been many approaches proposed to address this problem, including principal components, the cross-spectral metric and the multistage Wiener filter. This latter approach is superior to other reduced rank techniques in terms of computational efficiency, sample support and rank requirements. Regarding operation in heterogeneous environments, the single data set approach for clutter suppression has been proposed and operates solely on the cell under test to obtain a clutter covariance estimate. It is therefore highly effective in environments with limited training data that is homogeneous with the test data. In this paper, a single data set detection approach under the framework of the multistage Wiener filter is proposed and analysed to enhance clutter suppression capabilities.

"cognitive mimo sonar based robust target detection for harbor and maritime surveillance applications","2009","Robust detection of various hostile threats is vital to protect Navy ships and other facilities within harbor and maritime environments. Traditional single-input single-output (SISO) sonar transmits single acoustic waveform by single projector, which has a few disadvantages including low target detection probability, low resolution, vulnerability of interception by the enemy, sensitivity to jamming, etc. Multi-input multi-output (MIMO), typically applied to communications and radar solutions, is an emerging technology that can be applied to sonar to overcome many of the SISO sonar disadvantages.

While the lack of coherent signal processing capabilities is compensated by strong pulse power, there is still a demand for improving detection and tracking performances especially in front of heavy sea clutter for detecting small and evasive targets. The solutions that address such demands are based upon the use of solid state transceivers which allow to generate and to process specifically designed waveforms incorporating for example frequency or phase codes.","Slot antennas,object detection,sea clutter,maritime traffic surveillance,Doppler radar,search radar,solid state transceivers,Radar antennas,target tracking,Polynomials,target detection,radar clutter,Antenna measurements,radar signal processing,transceivers,solid state pulse Doppler radars,radars signal processing,"
"a non-lethal system for preventing maritime vessels from invading or evading naval perimeters","2022","Owing to the rise in the number of belligerent and unauthorized vessels, there is a pressing need for a solution to stop ships at naval zones without resorting to force. The vessels should not be irreparably destroyed, but their speed should be reduced significantly to aid the concerned officials to seize/confront the vessels. This paper discusses the design and fabrication of a system to detect and non-lethally halt the ships from entering or escaping naval boundaries as the intentions of such vessels may or may not be malicious. The solution aims to improve vessel-stopping technology by providing an efficient and non-lethal means of slowing down these vessels and ensuring the safety of all onboard passengers.","system design,pneumatic launcher,Safety,vessel arrest,naval perimeters,Marine vehicles,maritime vessels,Fabrication,LIDAR system,propulsion,Pressing,Mechatronics,ships,marine safety,naval boundaries,marine engineering,Force,Seaports,non-lethal,sea anchor,naval zones,optical radar,boat stop,unauthorized vessels,vessel-stopping technology,marine,nonlethal system,drag,defense,passenger safety,"
"benefits of terrasar-x - paz constellation for maritime surveillance","2014","This paper focuses on the benefits of constellations for maritime monitoring applications. The Strait of Malacca has been selected as an example area, as in the past, it has been subject to pirate attacks on merchant ships. SAR Missions are already contributing to maritime surveillance worldwide, and the constellation approach offers the opportunity for more frequent observations. With the TerraSAR-X / PAZ constellation significant improvements concerning revisit time, capacity and coverage of area can be achieved. The paper also introduces the new TerraSAR-X Wide ScanSAR mode in terms of ship detection capabilities.",""
"a cognitive maritime sar concept for high altitude platforms","2019","This paper introduces a novel cognitive synthetic aperture radar (SAR) concept for multifunctional maritime operation. The proposed system relies on the interaction with the environment to select autonomously the areas of high interest and adapt the next transmission configuration on the fly. Thus, it becomes feasible to control the different parameters and scanning combinations to reach a high imaging and tracking performance with less complexity compared to the fixed operating state-of-the-art sensors. Through this paper, we aim to open up a new perspective of smart SAR sensors based on beamforming on transmit and cognitive parameters control. The corresponding SAR cycle and models are described as well as the operation mode and the system specifications.","array signal processing,multifunctional maritime operation,marine radar,Cognitive Radar,transmission configuration,Synthetic Aperture Radar,high altitude platforms,smart SAR sensors,Detection and Tracking,cognitive parameter control,operation mode,Digital Beamforming,cognitive synthetic aperture radar,cognitive radar,intelligent sensors,synthetic aperture radar,cognitive maritime SAR concept,radar imaging,beamforming,high imaging performance,radar tracking,SAR cycle,tracking performance,oceanographic techniques,"
