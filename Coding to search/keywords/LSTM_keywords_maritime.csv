"learning temporal features for detection on maritime airborne video sequences using convolutional lstm","2019","In this paper, we study the effectiveness of learning temporal features to improve detection performance in videos captured by small aircraft. To implement this learning process, we use a convolutional long short-term memory (LSTM) associated with a pretrained convolutional neural network (CNN). To improve the training process, we incorporate domain-specific knowledge about the expected size and number of boats. We carry out three tests. The first searches the best sequence length and subsampling rate for training and the second compares the proposed method with a traditional CNN, a traditional LSTM, and a gated recurrent unit (GRU).

"a novel quality control method of time-series ocean wave observation data combining deep-learning prediction and statistical analysis","2023","Quality control (QC) of marine data is a critical aspect in ensuring the usability of oceanic data. In this paper, we propose a novel QC method for time-series ocean wave data, which combines deep learning prediction and statistical analysis. Our method first realizes multi-element LSTM prediction of the time-series ocean wave observation data, capturing both temporal consistency and physical relationships between the multi-element inputs. Then, it applies peak detection on the regional mean difference ratio derived from the predicted and true values of the ocean wave data, and finally labels the anomalous data points based on peak detection results. We conducted experiments on the time-series wave data of four sites from the National Marine Science Center, China, and compared our proposed method with traditional QC method that is currently used for operational marine data quality control, as well as classic anomaly detection models including Isolation Forest and VAE-LSTM. The results show a significant improvement in the Precision, Recall, and F1 Score for erroneous samples using our proposed method. Our proposed method takes advantages of both deep learning and statistical analysis and considers physical correlation of multiple elements of marine data, effectively addressing the problem of erroneous discrimination of abnormal sea conditions in the traditional method, and providing valuable insights for the study of marine time-series observational data.","Deep-learning prediction,Time-series data,Statistical analysis,Quality control,"
"research on the construction of maritime legal knowledge graph","2022","As the marine industry booms, the maritime legal documents are of great importance to the maneuver on the sea. However, the traditional way of consulting the text can not meet the demand of maritime operation nowadays. This paper aims to explore a way to extract and strengthen data from maritime legal texts to better support legal question answering. To mine knowledge from unstructured maritime laws and regulations, this paper proposes a method to build the maritime legal knowledge graph. To extract information from unstructured texts, BERT+BiLSTM+CRF is used for named entity recognition. DeepKE toolkit is used for relation extraction.

"a multi-task learning-based framework for global maritime trajectory and destination prediction with ais data","2022","Automatic Identification System (AIS) was initially developed for tracking ships and avoiding collisions. As numerous small satellites were launched in recent years, millions of AIS messages are captured by these satellite AIS providers every day. The massive amount of data allow shipping firms and port operators to better predict vessels’ movement. In this study, a computational framework is developed to predict future trajectories and destinations of vessels by applying deep learning to the satellite AIS messages containing self-reporting positioning data. We employed deep learning approaches for large-scale maritime prediction and identifies the most suitable deep neural networks for this specific application. Three prediction models, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Dense Neural Networks (DNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) have been tested in the framework. A multi-task learning architecture is implemented based on test results. Through sharing parameters while training, this architecture enables long-term destination predictions by balancing short-term trajectory predictions. The framework is validated globally with the experiments covering five large-scale sea areas. The experimental results demonstrate that the LSTM model with an average accuracy percentage of 85.1% outperforms the CNN and DNN with accuracy percentages of 68.3% and 78.2% respectively. The LSTM model with multi-task architecture can achieve an accuracy of 87.0%. With the proposed computational framework, AIS data can be utilized for maritime predictions, supporting more complex marine applications and covering more expansive geographic areas.","Vessel trajectory prediction,Automatic Identification System,Vessel origin–destination analysis,Vessel destination prediction,"
"neural network-based automatic reconstruction of missing vessel trajectory data","2019","Automatic identification system (AIS) is an independent tracking system which has been widely utilized on ships to frequently broadcast the time-stamped vessel position reports. The generated massive AIS data can contribute to protecting maritime security and enhancing maritime transportation efficiency, such as maritime surveillance, anomaly detection and traffic route extraction, etc. However, the received AIS-based vessel trajectories commonly suffer from missing data due to network overload and bad weathers. To improve the quality of vessel trajectories for further researches, a two-step calculation method for vessel trajectory reconstruction is proposed in this work. In particular, the Random Forest method is introduced in the first step to automatically identify the missing position records within vessel trajectories. The missing data points could be accurately estimated from both theoretical and practical perspectives. The second step proposes a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based supervised learning method to reconstruct the vessel trajectories with missing AIS data. The LSTM-based reconstruction method is able to take full advantage of the similar geometrical features behind massive vessel trajectories.

"motion primitives learning of ship-ship interaction patterns in encounter situations","2022","Understanding the ship encounter situations is a tough task, since the uncertain motions of encountering ships and the long-lasting frequent interactions make the encounter processes dynamic and stochastic. If we can decompose these complex encounter processes into motion primitives, which represent the elementary interaction patterns, an encounter can be more easily understood and identified. In this study, we propose a two-stream Long Short-Term Memory-based autoencoder (LSTM-based AE) approach to extract motion primitives from multi-dimensional encounter data without specific rules and prior knowledge. This approach leverages the sequential representation ability of LSTM to learn the temporal dependencies of each encountering ship motion. Then, we developed a fusion gate named dynamic artificial potential field (DAPF) to fuse the outputs of two LSTMs and generated the high-level representation needed to capture the spatiotemporal relationships of the interactions. After that, through a clustering method, the motion primitives were automatically extracted to describe various interaction patterns. The effectiveness of this approach was validated by naturalistic encounter data. The low reconstruction errors of the LSTM-based AE demonstrated that high-level representations captured the relationships of the interactions in both temporal and spatial dimensions. Case studies demonstrated that the utilization of motion primitives provided a semantically interpretable technique to analyze the interaction patterns and encounter process, which is conducive to situation awareness and decision-making for developing intelligent ships.","Motion primitives,Representation learning,Encounter situation,Two-stream LSTM,Ship-ship interaction,"

"a cnn-lstm network for augmenting target detection in real maritime wide area surveillance radar data","2020","Typical radar detectors exploit only a small proportion of the valuable information contained in radar reflections, i.e. magnitude and Doppler. A neural network-based approach for augmenting traditional radar detector structures using machine learning (ML) is proposed in this paper. Specifically, the network is designed to augment target detection in the field of maritime wide area surveillance for non-coherent data. A combination network consisting of a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract spatial features and a long short-term memory (LSTM) for extracting temporal patterns in the spatial features is proposed. The network augments the detector structure by blanking out regions of the frame which are classified as not containing a target, thus reducing false alarms. The network is tested on data containing four marine targets collected by a ground-based radar. The data set was chosen because it contains strong sea clutter returns. When ML is used, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves are shifted to lower probability of false alarm (PFA). A Kalman filter tracker was applied to the ML-augmented and baseline detections, and it was shown that ML-augmented detections produced similar tracks at lower PFA. The feature discovering capability of the network is analyzed through a series of tests, and the argument is made that the CNN-LSTM network presented in this work demonstrates the ability to improve the detection performance by exploiting spatial and temporal information in the data.","real maritime wide area surveillance radar data,detector structure,Kalman filters,marine radar,baseline detections,radar detection,radar clutter,CNN-LSTM network,Feature extraction,ML-augmented detections,LSTM,target detection augmentation,neural nets,target tracking,short-term memory,wide area surveillance radar,Artificial neural networks,CNN,noncoherent data,maritime surveillance,object detection,feature extraction,combination network,search radar,data set,radar imaging,convolutional neural network,detection performance,ground-based radar,neural network-based approach,radar detectors,radar tracking,radar reflections,temporal information,marine targets,probability,Clutter,Object detection,false alarm,traditional radar detector structures,learning (artificial intelligence),spatial features,Detectors,Radar detection,spatial information,"
"smart anomaly detection for slocum underwater gliders with a variational autoencoder with long short-term memory networks","2022","Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are used extensively for monitoring the world’s oceans, taking measurements of oceanographic characteristics along the water column. Presently, there is no holistic anomaly detection system in operation and AUVs require experienced pilots to monitor the progress of missions. This results in a large operational overhead and reduces the number of AUVs that can be deployed simultaneously. This article proposes an online anomaly detection system for underwater gliders based on a data-driven approach. A novel Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Variational Autoencoder (VAE) has been developed and trained using field data from four deployments with healthy glider behaviour and then tested against four deployments where faults are present. The system is able to detect wing loss with a high degree of accuracy on gliders unseen during the models training, highlighting the generality of the model to different platforms. Additionally, the VAE method outperforms model-based solution for the detection of biofouling, proving its generality to different types of anomalies. The proposed smart anomaly detection will contribute to increasing the capacity of AUVs and reducing the dependence on support vessels and experienced pilots.","Underwater glider,Variational autoencoder,Marine autonomous system,Anomaly detection,Long short-term memory network,"

Therefore, lossless reliable communication with a high data rate is the key requirement in modern wireless communication systems. These all factors highly depend upon channel conditions. In this work, a channel model is proposed for air-to-surface link exploiting millimeter wave (mmWave) for 5G enabled maritime unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication. Firstly, we will present the formulated channel estimation method which directly aims to adopt channel state information (CSI) of mmWave from the channel model inculcated by UAV operating within the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)-Distributed Conditional generative adversarial network (DCGAN) i.e. (LSTM-DCGAN) for each beamforming direction.

"interval prediction of vessel trajectory based on lower and upper bound estimation and attention-modified lstm with bayesian optimization","2023","Uncertainty prediction of vessel trajectory is essential to enhance maritime situational awareness and traffic safety. Traditional approaches for trajectory prediction face challenges in accurately quantifying uncertainties, thereby limiting effectiveness in decision-making. To address this challenge, we propose a hybrid interval prediction frame of vessel trajectory using the lower and upper bound estimation (LUBE) and attention-modified long short-term memory (LSTM) network with bayesian optimization (BO). Firstly, trajectory data is preprocessed to solve the scale irregularity. Then, a novel trajectory interval prediction model for perceiving the prediction uncertainties is designed based on an advanced attention-modified LSTM with interval prediction capability. Meanwhile, a supervised training strategy with differentiating the interval widths of latitude and longitude is put forward to devise sample labels for training the model. Additionally, a new prediction interval-based objective function is proposed considering the target of maximizing coverage and minimizing width of trajectory interval. The BO algorithm optimizes the weighted parameters in the LSTM network by minimizing the objective function value. Finally, cases from two water areas are implemented to test and verify the proposed method. The results illustrate the superiority of the proposed approach in (1) outperforming other methods used for comparison in both coverage probability and width criteria of prediction interval. (2) quantifying the prediction uncertainty and improving the reliability of trajectory predictor. (3) performing anomaly detection tasks using visualized trajectory prediction intervals. The research can help maritime traffic participants obtain more reliable trajectory data, which supports making more reasonable traffic supervision decisions.","Long short-term memory,Attention mechanism,Vessel trajectory,Lower and upper bound estimation (LUBE),Interval prediction,"
"trajectory pattern extraction and anomaly detection for maritime vessels","2021","Trajectory analysis and extraction of trajectory patterns are crucial to enhance marine safety and marine status awareness. The major data source for such analysis is Automatic Identification System (AIS), which publishes data related to movement of the ship while cruising.

"a contextual hybrid model for vessel movement prediction","2021","Predicting the movement of the vessels can significantly improve the management of safety. While the movement can be a function of geographic contexts, the current systems and methods rarely incorporate contextual information into the analysis. This paper initially proposes a novel context-aware trajectoriesâ€™ simplification method to embed the effects of geographic context which guarantees the logical consistency of the compressed trajectories, and further suggests a hybrid method that is built upon a curvilinear model and deep neural networks. The proposed method employs contextual information to check the logical consistency of the curvilinear method and then, constructs a Context-aware Long Short-Term Memory (CLSTM) network that can take into account contextual variables, such as the vessel types. The proposed method can enhance the prediction accuracy while maintaining the logical consistency, through a recursive feedback loop. The implementations of the proposed approach on the Automatic Identification System (AIS) dataset, from the eastern coast of the United States of America which was collected, from November to December 2017, demonstrates the effectiveness and better compression, i.e. 80% compression ratio while maintaining the logical consistency.

However, the system's reliability heavily relies on GNSS availability. This paper proposes a method to enhance the reliability of shipborne INS/GNSS integrated navigation systems during GNSS abnormal sampling periods. The proposed method consists of two parts. Firstly, using specially designed input and output parameters, a pseudo-GNSS prediction model based on a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network (Bi-LSTM) is constructed to generate predicted pseudo-GNSS measurements during periods of GNSS loss, effectively filling in the gaps left by the absence of actual GNSS data. Secondly, Huber's M-estimation-based Robust Cubature Kalman filter (RCKF) is integrated into the data fusion algorithm, and a switching mechanism between RCKF and the Cubature Kalman filter (CKF) is established based on the source of GNSS data utilized for measurement update, to mitigate the impact of non-Gaussian distribution prediction noise introduced by pseudo-GNSS prediction model. Experimental validation using real ship navigation data in a natural marine environment confirms the proposed method's capability to maintain navigation accuracy during GNSS loss for shipborne INS/GNSS integrated navigation systems.

To address the above problems, we propose a novel hybrid approach, CSDLSTM(Course/Speed-DBSCAN and LSTM), which combines Density-based Clustering(DBSCAN) and long short-term memory networks to improve the efficiency of ABVD. Specifically, a three-dimensional CS-DBSCAN (Course/Speed-DBSCAN) algorithm is proposed, which incorporates speed and course features along with geospatial information in the clustering process to accurately describe vessel behavior. In addition, the clustering results are used as traffic patterns to train the LSTM predictor for real-time maritime anomaly detection. Experiments conducted on real AIS datasets demonstrate that the CSD-LSTM method has greater precision and efficiency in ABVD.","Traffic control,Transportation,Clustering algorithms,LSTM,Prediction algorithms,CS-DBSCAN,Sensitivity,Real-time systems,Heuristic algorithms,abnormal vessel behavior,"
"data-driven trajectory quality improvement for promoting intelligent vessel traffic services in 6g-enabled maritime iot systems","2021","Future generation communication systems, such as 5G and 6G wireless systems, exploit the combined satellite-terrestrial communication infrastructures to extend network coverage and data throughput for data-driven applications. These ground-breaking techniques have promoted the rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT) in maritime industries. In maritime IoT applications, intelligent vessel traffic services can be guaranteed by collecting and analyzing high volume of spatial data flows from automatic identification system (AIS). This AIS system includes a highly integrated automatic equipment, including functionalities of core communication, tracking, and sensing. The increased utilization of shipboard AIS devices allows the collection of massive trajectory data. However, the received raw AIS data often suffers from undesirable outliers (i.e., poorly tracked timestamped points for vessel trajectories) during signal acquisition and analog-to-digital conversion. The degraded AIS data will bring negative effects on vessel traffic services (e.g., maritime traffic monitoring, intelligent maritime navigation, vessel collision avoidance, etc.) in maritime IoT scenarios. To improve the quality of vessel trajectory records from AIS networks, we propose to develop a two-phase data-driven machine learning framework for vessel trajectory reconstruction. In particular, a density-based clustering method is introduced in the first phase to automatically recognize the undesirable outliers. The second phase proposes a bidirectional long short-term memory (BLSTM)-based supervised learning technique to restore the timestamped points degraded by random outliers in vessel trajectories. Comprehensive experiments on simulated and realistic data sets have verified the dominance of our two-phase vessel reconstruction framework compared to other competing methods. It thus has the capacity of promoting intelligent vessel traffic services in 6G-enabled maritime IoT systems.","short-term memory-based supervised learning technique,maritime traffic monitoring,recurrent neural nets,supervised learning technique,intelligent maritime navigation,data-driven applications,AIS networks,Internet of Things,Monitoring,neural networks,6G-enabled maritime IoT systems,vessel collision avoidance,time stamped point restoration,shipboard AIS devices,BLSTM,two-phase vessel reconstruction framework,spatial data,5G mobile communication,automatic identification system,maritime IoT applications,supervised learning,vessel traffic services,signal reconstruction,intelligent vessel traffic services,6G mobile communication,pattern clustering,vessel trajectories,Artificial intelligence,analogue-digital conversion,two-phase data-driven machine,raw AIS data system,telecommunication traffic,maritime Internet of Things (IoT),6G wireless systems,integrated automatic equipment,Trajectory,signal detection,vessel trajectory reconstruction,marine communication,automatic identification system (AIS),Navigation,maritime industries,bidirectional long short-term memory,combined satellite-terrestrial communication,data-driven trajectory quality improvement,massive trajectory data,future generation communication systems,"
