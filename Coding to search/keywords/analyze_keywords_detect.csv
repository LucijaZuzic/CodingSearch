"dual-band slotted waveguide antenna array for communication, maritime navigation and surveillance radar","2015","This paper describes the development of a dualband slotted waveguide antenna for communication, navigation and surveillance radar applications. Two different slot sizes on opposite faces are designed for enabling antenna operation over two different frequency bands. In this way, it becomes possible to perform diverse sorts of tracking using a unique structure. Numerical results, obtained using ANSYS HFSS, demonstrate the proposed antenna provides two bandwidths of approximately 15% and 6.5% for S-band and C-band, respectively. The antenna gain varies from 12.7dBi at 2.2 GHz to 16.37dBi at 4.6GHz.","multifrequency antennas,C-band,Radar antennas,Antenna arrays,gain 16.37 dB,slot antenna arrays,ANSYS HFSS,dual-band slotted waveguide antenna array,maritime navigation,search radar,S-band,Radar,Slot antennas,Electromagnetic waveguides,radionavigation,bandwidth 4.6 GHz,bandwidth 2.2 GHz,numerical analysis,surveillance radar,gain 12.7 dB,Arrays,"
"maritime anomaly detection in a real-world scenario: ever given grounding in the suez canal","2022","In this paper we present how automatic maritime anomaly detection tools can be successfully applied in real-world situations such as the major event of the container vessel Ever Given, which grounded in the Suez Canal on March 23rd 2021. The anomaly detector is designed to process the available sequence of Automatic Identification System (AIS) reports, information from ground-based or satellite radar systems if available, and contextual information defining the expected nominal behavior of navigation. A statistical hypothesis testing procedure is sequentially run to decide whether or not a deviation from the nominal behavior happened within a specific time period, for instance two consecutive data points. We show, based on the recorded AIS data from the Ever Given, that the proposed detector could have been triggered and alerted to anomalous behavior fully 19 minutes before the grounding.","anomaly detector,Anomaly detection,Marine vehicles,Grounding,statistical hypothesis testing,Ever Given grounding,automatic maritime anomaly detection tools,statistical analysis,Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process,Testing,ships,Containers,automatic identification system,radar,maritime surveillance,satellite radar systems,contextual information,container vessel,Suez Canal,Artificial intelligence,ground-based system,marine engineering computing,Maritime anomaly detection,Irrigation,statistical hypothesis testing procedure,expected nominal behavior,AIS data,"
"new findings on impact of covid lockdown over terrestrial ecosystems from leo-geo satellites","2021","The COVID 19 pandemic led to lockdown and restrictions on anthropogenic activities not only in India but all over the world. This provided an opportunity to study positive effects on environment and subsequent impact on terrestrial ecosystems such as urban, peri-urban, forest and agriculture. A variety of studies presented so far mainly include improved air quality index, water quality, reduced pollutants etc. The present study focused on few novel parameters from both polar and geostationary satellites that are not studied in context to India, and also attempts deriving/quantifying benefits rather than merely indicating qualitative improvements. Due to lack of anthropogenic activities during complete lockdown-1 (21 days from 25 March 2020) in India nighttime cooling of land surface temperature (LST) of the order of 2–6 K was observed. Amongst 10 major cities, Bhopal showed highest nighttime cooling. The cooling effect in LST was evident in 80% of industrial units distinctly indicating cooling trend. Vegetation fires were analyzed in 10 fire-prone states of India. Compared to past four-years average number of occurrences, only 45% fire occurrences occurred during lockdown, indicating strong effect of lockdown. The study also revealed that, there is increase in gross primary production in forest ecosystem to the tune of maximum 38%, during this period. Though delay in rabi crop harvest date by 1–2 weeks in majority of north Indian states was observed rise in rabi crop productivity of the order of maximum 34% was observed which is attributed to favorable environmental conditions for net carbon uptake. About 18% reduction in volumetric agricultural water demand was estimated in Indo-Gangetic region, parts of Gujarat and Rajasthan. Apart from controlling the spread of the disease, the lockdown restrictions were thus also able to show positive effects on the environment and ecosystem which might influence to rethink on strategies for sustainable development.","COVID,Terrestrial ecosystems,Space-based observations,Positive impacts,Lockdown,"
"an analysis of path loss models of lte-maritime for mobile communication system in maritime environments","2019","Mobile users in maritime environments have the limitation to use various data services due to insufficient communication infrastructure. Many communication systems commonly used for terrestrial users have been applied to maritime environments. The objective of this paper is to analyze the path loss characteristics of long term evolution (LTE) system and confirm its feasibility in maritime environments. In this purpose, we developed the test-bed for LTE-Maritime at coastline in the Republic of Korea and conducted onboard experiments for reference signal received power (RSRP) and throughput measurements. The measured RSRP values are compared with three conventional path loss models of free space path loss (FSPL), two ray (TR) path loss, Okumura-Hata (OH) model. The comparison results show that the existing models tend to underestimate the RSRP degradation suffered from maritime environment and there is a notable difference between the experiment data and path loss models. In order to analyze their accuracy, root mean square error (RMSE) for each model is calculated according to the distance between a transmitter and a receiver, and the results show that the expected error becomes high with increasing distance. In addition, the throughput measurements show that LTE can provide high-speed data services in the order of Mbps with the long communication distance up to 100 km.","long term evolution system,maritime,conventional path loss models,RMSE,Antenna measurements,Marine vehicles,Mathematical model,LTE,Sea measurements,size 100.0 km,LTE-maritime,mobile communication system,cellular radio,Data models,field measurement,root mean square error,mean square error methods,communication systems,maritime environment,Loss measurement,marine communication,ray path loss,Path loss,Long Term Evolution,path loss characteristics,free space path loss,"
"collaborative optimization scheduling of maritime communication for mobile edge architecture","2018","The rapid development of the land-based edge computing architecture has pushed the horizon of a new processing mode, which transfers the big data processing from the cloud to the edge side. In the contex of mobile edge computing, combined with the idea of collaborative cooperation, we put forward a maritime mobile collaborative edge communication model. A novelty of the model is the addition of a new level of collaborative edge as a small-type processing center between the cloud and the edge sides. For the sake of high efficiency in task scheduling of the collaborative edge part, we adopt an improved Cooperative Co-evolution Algorithm to overcome the constraints of marine environment and communication costs. In order to make the complex matters simplify, this paper adopts the divide-and-conquer strategy and transforms the scheduling optimization problem into the issue of seeking the best individual set of subpopulations. Simulation results verified the performance of the solution.","edge sides,Sociology,evolutionary computation,Mobile edge computing,Improved Cooperative Coevolution Algorithm,marine environment,groupware,collaborative optimization scheduling,land-based edge computing architecture,telecommunication scheduling,small-type processing center,Scheduling optimization,collaborative edge part,Servers,scheduling optimization problem,communication costs,mobile computing,mobile edge computing,Collaboration,Statistics,mobile edge architecture,maritime communication,Big Data,Collaborative cooperation,Edge computing,cooperative communication,big data processing,Cloud computing,marine communication,collaborative cooperation,Task analysis,divide-and-conquer strategy,divide and conquer methods,improved Cooperative Co-evolution Algorithm,task scheduling,maritime mobile collaborative edge communication model,"
"vessel sailing route extraction and analysis from satellite-based ais data using density clustering and probability algorithms","2023","The vessel Automatic Identification System (AIS) data collected by satellites have the features of large coverage area and large data volume, and they are instantaneous discrete data rather than time-continuous data, so the data has large dispersion with many noise points. This poses a challenge for vessel sailing route extraction. This paper proposes a vessel sailing route extraction method which consists of the fast Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm and the Kernel Density Estimation-based Outlier Factor (KDE-based OF) noise reduction algorithm. The method in this paper firstly improves the clustering discrimination method in the DBSCAN algorithm to separate trajectories in different directions. Secondly, this paper extracts a fast clustering algorithm based on the density clustering algorithm to reduce its computing time overhead with satellite big data. Finally, this paper proposes the KDE-based OF processing algorithm, which calculates the outlier probability distribution value of the trajectory points through the algorithm to eliminate the edge trajectory points with low probability distribution. Based on the actual satellite vessel AIS data, this paper conducts multi-method comparisons and performance analysis experiments. Experiments show that the proposed method has the best stability and advancement.","Vessel sailing route extraction,Kernel Density Estimation-based Outlier Factor (KDE-based OF),Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN),Automatic Identification System (AIS),"
"cyber risk perception in the maritime domain: a systematic literature review","2021","This paper aims to present an approach to investigate cyber risk perception with use of recognized psychological models, and to give an overview of state-of-the-art research within the field of cyber risk perception in general and in the context of the maritime domain. The focus will be on determinative dimensions within the psychometric paradigm and cognitive biases, and to give recommendations on further research within these fields. Okoli and Schabramâ€™s eight-step guide to plan, select, extract, and execute a systematic literature review is used as guidance. The search process resulted in 25 relevant articles which describes 24 dimensions of cyber risk perception in different online environments. Research within the area of maritime cyber security is increasing, however, no studies relevant for our literature review were found within the maritime domain. The nine dimensions in the psychometric model, perceived benefit and the optimistic bias is presented and discussed in a maritime context. Cyber risk perception is a complex research-area where both determinative factors and other cognitive processes can be influenced by each other. This can indicate that the dimensions differ across populations and professions, creating grounds for why context-specific studies are important. Further research may benefit from more multidisciplinary, descriptive, and inductive approaches, and contextual studies within maritime cyber risk perception can contribute to develop targeted tools for risk mitigation to enhance safety at sea.","risk perception,Safety,online environments,systematic literature review,maritime cyber risk perception,human behavior,security of data,human factors,psychology,Cyberspace,cognition,search process,Bibliographies,marine safety,psychological models,marine engineering,cognitive biases,project management,Computer crime,cognitive processes,maritime cyber security,cyberpsychology,risk analysis,Psychology,psychometric paradigm,Maritime cyber security,Tools,risk communication,Systematics,"
"scrupulous proxies: defining and applying a rigorous framework for the selection and evaluation of a suite of ecological indicators","2019","Ecosystem indicators are key to understanding, assessing, and managing ecosystems and to implementing an Ecosystem Approach to Management. We present a guidance framework for the selection and evaluation of indicators for assessment of ecosystem status, trends monitoring and reporting and apply it to the Scotian Shelf Bioregion, Nova Scotia, Canada. In particular, we focus on the selection of a parsimonious suite of complementary indicators using clear criteria and hierarchical cluster analysis to reduce redundancy in the indicator suite. In applying the framework to the Scotian Shelf Bioregion we separate the region into a range of spatial scales for indicator estimation to determine the impact of spatial aggregation on indicator redundancy. Overall results suggest patterns of redundancy among indicators were generally consistent at all spatial scales. Differences in indicator trends for eastern and western Scotian Shelf were observed, reflecting their different environmental properties and fishing histories. In a few cases, spatial differences in indicators trends were large enough to remove these indicators from a cluster representing all spatial scales. We recommend that the Redundancy Analysis should be repeated every 5–10 years to ensure that the clusters are still strong and that the indicator selected to represent the cluster is still optimal. Overall, the assessment of the Scotian Shelf Bioregion highlighted large coherent trends across indicators and attributes at all spatial scales indicating that this system has undergone massive, negative change since 1970. Despite reductions in fishing pressure in many fisheries through resource management actions, most attributes have not improved in recent years. This Framework represents a general approach that can be extended to additional system goals, attributes and indicators and is widely applicable across data rich and data poor systems.","Indicator,Scale,Ecosystem approach,Framework,Scotian Shelf,Redundancy,"
"cloud object analysis of ceres aqua observations of tropical and subtropical cloud regimes: evolution of cloud object size distributions during the madden–julian oscillation","2017","In this study, we analyze cloud object data from the Aqua satellite between July 2006 and June 2010 that are matched with the real-time multivariate Madden–Julian Oscillation (MJO) index to examine the impact of MJO evolution on the evolutions of the size distributions of cloud object types. These types include deep convective (DC), cirrostratus, shallow cumulus, stratocumulus and overcast-stratus. A cloud object is a contiguous region of the earth with a single dominant cloud-system type. It is found that the cloud object size distributions of some phases depart greatly from the 8-phase combined distribution at large cloud-object diameters. The large-size group of cloud objects contributes to most of the temporal variations during the MJO evolution. For deep convective and cirrostratus cloud objects, there is a monotonic increase in both the number and footprint of large objects from the depressed to mature phases, which is attributed to the development and maturing of deep convection and anvils. The largest increase in the mean diameter during the mature phases that lasts to the early dissipating phase is related to growth of anvil clouds and is accompanied by moderate decreases in small-size objects. For shallow cumulus, the large objects decrease in number at the mature phases, but increase in number for both sizes before the mature phase. The opposite is true for the large overcast-stratus objects. The temporal evolution of large stratocumulus objects is similar to that of deep convective and cirrostratus object types except for peaking slightly earlier.","Madden-Julian Oscillation,Cloud size distribution,Aqua observations,CERES,Cloud regimes,"
"application of artificial neural networks to photovoltaic fault detection and diagnosis: a review","2021","The rapid development of photovoltaic (PV) technology and the growing number and size of PV power plants require increasingly efficient and intelligent health monitoring strategies to ensure reliable operation and high energy availability. Among the various techniques, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) has exhibited the functional capacity to perform the identification and classification of PV faults. In the present review, a systematic study on the application of ANN and hybridized ANN models for PV fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) is conducted. For each application, the targeted PV faults, the detectable faults, the type and amount of data used, the model configuration and the FDD performance are extracted, and analyzed.

"mutation in pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase 1 gene in families with cutis laxa type 2","2009","Autosomal-recessive cutis laxa type 2 (ARCL2) is a multisystem disorder characterized by the appearance of premature aging, wrinkled and lax skin, joint laxity, and a general developmental delay. Cutis laxa includes a family of clinically overlapping conditions with confusing nomenclature, generally requiring molecular analyses for definitive diagnosis. Six genes are currently known to mutate to yield one of these related conditions. We ascertained a cohort of typical ARCL2 patients from a subpopulation isolate within eastern Canada. Homozygosity mapping with high-density SNP genotyping excluded all six known genes, and instead identified a single homozygous region near the telomere of chromosome 17, shared identically by state by all genotyped affected individuals from the families. A putative pathogenic variant was identified by direct DNA sequencing of genes within the region. The single nucleotide change leads to a missense mutation adjacent to a splice junction in the gene encoding pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase 1 (PYCR1). Bioinformatic analysis predicted a pathogenic effect of the variant on splice donor site function. Skipping of the associated exon was confirmed in RNA from blood lymphocytes of affected homozygotes and heterozygous mutation carriers. Exon skipping leads to deletion of the reductase functional domain-coding region and an obligatory downstream frameshift. PYCR1 plays a critical role in proline biosynthesis. Pathogenicity of the genetic variant in PYCR1 is likely, given that a similar clinical phenotype has been documented for mutation carriers of another proline biosynthetic enzyme, pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase. Our results support a significant role for proline in normal development.",""
"robust broadband maritime communications: theoretical and experimental validation","2018","Atmospheric ducts, which are caused by the rapid decrease in the refractive index of the lower atmosphere, have been recognized as the dominant propagation mechanism for long range maritime links. Recent advances in radio technology are making reliable high-capacity overwater links a reality. A ray-tracing simulation model was developed to obtain reliable prediction of maritime link performance beyond 30 km for realistic conditions. A series of static and mobile long range maritime multiple-input multiple-output links were tested with representative antenna heights at 1.39 (Band 3 or L-Band) and 4.5 GHz (Band 4 or C-Band) during periods with various levels of ducting activities, for example, sunset and sunrise times. Measured link performance and observed ducting occurrences are compared to predictions to validate the model ability to accurately predict and explain link performance for various ducting conditions. The test results agree with the model predictions and illustrate the various Received Signal Level degradation, enhancement, and fluctuations that can be expected in long range maritime links below 6 GHz. We also report on short-term (few to several minutes) fluctuations of the received signal level at the two measurement frequency bands during high ducting activity periods. Measurements and theoretical analysis of the effect of ducting on the quality of maritime communication links indicate that both reflection-induced and ducting-induced disruptions are different and more frequent in higher-frequency bands. This work opens interesting perspectives on providing more robust and more predictable communications in the presence of ducting.","Sea measurements,Sea surface,Terrestrial atmosphere,Ocean temperature,Refractive index,Atmospheric modeling,Ducts,"
"satellite observation of pollutant emissions from gas flaring activities near the arctic","2016","Gas flaring is a common practice in the oil industry that can have significant environmental impacts, but has until recently been largely overlooked in terms of relevance to climate change. We utilize data from various satellite sensors to examine pollutant emissions from oil exploitation activities in four areas near the Arctic. Despite the remoteness of these sparsely populated areas, tropospheric NO2 retrieved from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) is substantial at ∼1 × 1015 molecules cm−2, suggesting sizeable emissions from these industrial activities. Statistically significant (at the 95% confidence level, corresponding uncertainties in parentheses) increasing trends of 0.017 (±0.01) × 1015 and 0.015 (±0.006) × 1015 molecules cm−2 year−1 over 2004–2015 were found for Bakken (USA) and Athabasca (Canada), two areas having recently experienced fast expansion in the oil industry. This rapid change has implications for emission inventories, which are updated less frequently. No significant trend was found for the North Sea (Europe), where oil production has been declining since the 1990s. For northern Russia, the trend was just under the 95% significance threshold at 0.0057 (±0.006) × 1015 molecules cm−2 year−1. This raises an interesting inconsistency as prior studies have suggested that, in contrast to the continued, albeit slow, expansion of Russian oil/gas production, gas flaring in Russia has decreased in recent years. However, only a fraction of oil fields in Russia were covered in our analysis. Satellite aerosol optical depth (AOD) data revealed similar tendencies, albeit at a weaker level of statistical significance, due to the longer lifetime of aerosols and contributions from other sources. This study demonstrates that synergetic use of data from multiple satellite sensors can provide valuable information on pollutant emission sources that is otherwise difficult to acquire.","OMI NO,Oil,Gas flaring,MODIS AOD,Arctic,"
"timing of major forest compositional changes and tree expansions in the retezat mts during the last 16,000 years","2018","This paper focuses on the Late Glacial (LG) and Holocene regional and local establishment times of several tree and shrub species in the Retezat Mountains (South Carpathians) using pollen, stomata and plant macrofossil records from four lakes situated at different altitudes. We used the empirical and rational pollen percentage limits to infer the local presence and population expansion/recession times. Our results show that Pinus mugo and P. sylvestris spread first at 15,100 cal yr BP in the mountain. P. mugo arrived at high altitudes (1740 m) already at 13,600 cal yr BP. The expansion of Larix decidua was weakly recorded in the pollen diagrams, but the plant macrofossil and stomata records suggested its Late Glacial expansion mainly on the northern slope and local presence since 14,900 cal yr BP at 1740 m. The species likely went extinct in the Late Holocene (around 3330 cal yr BP). The expansion of Picea abies and Ulmus commenced earlier on the southern slope, from 15,200 to 14,400 cal yr BP respectively, compared to the northern slope, where these species expanded from 14,300 to 13,850 cal yr BP. The following step was the expansion of Quercus at 13,900 cal yr BP. Following the Younger Dryas decrease of temperate deciduous taxa and P. abies, their expansion on the northern flank was in the order of P. abies (11,750), Ulmus (11,600), Quercus (11,100), Corylus (10,600), Carpinus betulus (7100), Abies alba (5100) and Fagus sylvatica (5000 cal yr BP). Timing of the Early Holocene tree expansions on the southern flank is ambiguous due to uncertainties in the Early Holocene age-depth model of Lake Lia; however, the mid-Holocene expansion of C. betulus and A. alba were well-dated in both southern slope pollen records to 7700 and 6100 cal yr BP, respectively, and we inferred several hundred years earlier expansion on the southern flank that can be explained by climatic differences. Higher solar radiation results in longer growing seasons and milder winters on the southern flank, which likely facilitated the earlier spread of these trees. For several woody taxa studied in this paper, last glacial maximum refugial populations can be inferred either locally in the mountain (P. abies, P. mugo, P. sylvestris, L. decidua) or in the region (Quercus, Ulmus, C. betulus, F. sylvatica) on the basis of their pollen presence since at least 15,700–16,000 cal yr BP and early increase during the LG. We compared the pollen inferred population expansion times of several tree taxa along a south-north transect in the Romanian Carpathians, and found that the Early Holocene high altitude expansion of A. alba (10,650–9400 cal yr BP) is exceptional in the region. We also demonstrated that the Holocene mass expansion of Quercus and C. avellana started earliest in the Retezat, and at least two centuries later in other sites in the Romanian Carpathians. We also demonstrated that certain tree species had preference for survival and/or early expansion on the northern slopes (A. alba, L. decidua, F. sylvatica), while others on the southern slopes (C. avellana, C. betulus).","Postglacial forest succession,Plant macrofossils,Expansion times,Carpathian Mountains,Pollen analysis,"
"estimation of dipole magnetic moment orientation based on magnetic signature waveform analysis by a magnetic sensor","2020","In this paper, we propose a measurement procedure to estimate the magnetic moment orientation (MMO) of a dipole. Theoretical analysis indicates that magnetic field in each orthogonal direction Bi (i = x, y, z) is found to be a superposition of its three basic elements Bij (i = x, y, z and j = 1, 2, 3) along certain direction, allowing the obtained dipole signature to be decomposed of 9 basic elements. An orthogonal energy ratio (OER) algorithm is used to infer the MMO by calculating the signal energy distribution along each axis. A standard OER database is developed which provides a reference to be compared with the measured OER. The one having the smallest variance is determined as the estimated MMO. Owing to space symmetric property, it generally introduces 8 possible solutions. Then, a mathematic method is presented to define the common characteristics of the magnetic signature in the 8 octants, which is able to identify the octant of unknown target based on detected Bi field. As a result, the unique MMO can be estimated. The experimental results show good estimation accuracy for the dipole orientation with average error of 3.5°. In particular, the algorithm is independent of changing CPA and velocity, which is demonstrated in simulation and experiment.","Magnetic moment,Magnetic anomaly signature,Estimation,"
"application of scanning laser doppler vibrometry for delamination detection in composite structures","2017","In this paper application of scanning laser Doppler vibrometry for delamination detection in composite structures was presented. Delamination detection was based on a guided wave propagation method. In this papers results from numerical and experimental research were presented. In the case of numerical research, the Spectral Element Method (SEM) was utilized, in which a mesh was composed of 3D spectral elements. SEM model included also a piezoelectric transducer. In the experimental research guided waves were excited using the piezoelectric transducer whereas the sensing process was conducted using scanning laser Doppler vibrometer (SLDV). Analysis of guided wave propagation and its interaction with delamination was based on a full wavefield approach. Attention was focused on interactions of guided waves with delamination manifested by A0 mode reflection, A0 mode entrapment, and S0/A0 mode conversion. Delamination was simulated by a teflon insert located between plies of composite material. Results of interaction with symmetrically and nonsymmetrical placed delamination (in respect to the composite sample thickness) were presented. Moreover, the authors investigated different size of delaminations. Damage detection was based on a new signal processing algorithm proposed by the authors. In this approach the weighted RMS was utilized selectively. It means that the summation in RMS formula was performed only for a specially selected time instances. Results for simple composite panels, panel with honeycomb core, and real stiffened composite panel from the aircraft were presented.","Mode conversion,Scanning laser Doppler vibrometry,Guided waves,Delamination detection,SLDV,Composite materials,"
"infrared small maritime target detection based on integrated target saliency measure","2021","Robust and effective detection of a small target in an infrared maritime image is a key technology of maritime target search and tracking applications. Infrared small target detection is a challenging task due to the factors such as dim small targets and various complex backgrounds caused by sun glitters and strong waves. In this article, the integrated target saliency measure (ITSM) based on local and nonlocal spatial information is proposed to improve target detection performance. We combine local heterogeneity property of targets and nonlocal self-correlation property of background with targets' sparsity to separate real targets from background clutters. First, local heterogeneity calculation based on cross-window standard deviation (CSD) is proposed to extract candidate targets preliminarily, which enhances the local intensity difference between small targets and neighboring background. Meanwhile, low-rank representation (LRR) is applied to background prediction and removal, which is followed by adaptive threshold segmentation to enhance target saliency. Finally, we integrate the results obtained from the two steps mentioned above to further enhance targets and suppress background clutters. Then, real targets are extracted by an iterative threshold on the integrated map so as to generate the seed map, in addition, the target expansion strategy is exploited to keep full target areas. Experimental results on six datasets show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of robustness and target detection accuracy.","CSD,target detection,cross-window standard deviation,LRR,Feature extraction,Infrared maritime image,infrared maritime image,background clutter suppression,low-rank representation (LRR),low-rank representation,Standards,marine engineering,maritime target search,integrated target saliency measure,object detection,local heterogeneity property,Sparse matrices,small target detection,infrared small maritime target detection,Large Hadron Collider,correlation methods,infrared imaging,local heterogeneity,integrated saliency,Clutter,Object detection,background prediction,Task analysis,image segmentation,nonlocal spatial information,"

"green development of the maritime industry: overview, perspectives, and future research opportunities","2023","Maritime industry is the artery of the global economy since it carries around 90% of the volume of global trade. However, the fierce environmental problems associated with human activities and economic development cannot be neglected. To systematically analyze the research status and development trend of the maritime industry, this paper collects and reviews literature from Elsevier ScienceDirect, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases related to green shipping management and green port construction. Future research directions are presented based on the analysis. The results show that green shipping management focus on solving practical emission reduction problems. Most work of green port construction establish mathematical optimization models aiming at minimizing total operation costs or maximizing profits. Designing efficient algorithms is a research hotspot in operation management. By comparing the technical measures, operational strategy, and market-based measures, we found technical innovation is the ultimate way for the maritime industry to realize net zero-emission. Support from governments and organizations is the insurance of green development. Future research perspectives include adopting high-tech technologies such as blockchain, big data, and artificial intelligent to improve operation efficiency and reduce emissions, providing more accurate suggestions for constructing green and smart ports, proposing multi-objective optimization models and highlighting the environmental target. This research can improve the existing theoretical frameworks and provide several future research directions for academia and practitioners.","Review,Green ports,Technical approach,Operation strategy,Policy-based measures,Green shipping,"

Emerging technologies like Automatic Identification System (AIS) provides multi-dimensional data which is used to construct a maritime traffic model. In this paper, we propose a framework of maritime traffic pattern extraction from vessel AIS information, which learns a traffic pattern using an unsupervised technique, and can be applied on historical Automatic Identification System data. AIS data is a kind of spatio-temporal data that contains information of location data, as well as time stamps. In this way, traffic pattern is described by AIS data. Furthermore, we conduct a simulation experiment that extracts traffic pattern from the AIS data through the unsupervised technique. The proposed framework takes advantage of AIS data, which is a type of the spatiotemporal data that consists of vessel motion information, to perform the experiment. The result shows that the unsupervised framework converts useful information from raw AIS data to effective traffic pattern.

"behaviour analysis and anomaly detection algorithms for the maritime integrated surveillance awareness","2019","The increasing complexity of social-economical activities in the maritime domain is raising new challenges to maritime administrations and agencies from coastal states. These challenges require innovative approaches to support maritime safety and security and, in particular, to promote the sustainable use of the oceans. One solution is to enhance Maritime Situational Awareness (MSA) using systems with high integration and efficient analysis capability. With this problem in mind, the European Commission awarded a grant to a project which aims to develop a framework that will enable a better decision process, by the operators and decision makers, at the maritime operations centers and allowing seamless cooperation between operating authorities and on-site/at sea/in air intervention forces. The project focuses on taking benefits from the data exchange to the next level, while remaining completely integrated in the current European policy. Securing shipping and human lives is of fundamental importance for our continued well-being. The most important way to cost-effectively enhance security and safety at sea is to cooperate at national and international levels.

"determination of measuring sites for solar irradiance, based on cluster analysis of satellite-derived cloud estimations","2013","Methods applied on efficient planning of ground-based monitoring networks of surface solar irradiance could provide valuable scientific results and be useful for accurate monitoring and efficient planning of solar energy applications. Based on the dominance of cloud effect on solar irradiance and the advantage of the high spatial resolution of a geostationary satellite, a novel method is presented for optimizing the location of measuring sites for the newly built Hellenic Network of Solar Energy (www.helionet.gr). The k-means algorithm is used for cluster analysis and the validation of the clustering method reveals that the variability of surface solar irradiance due to cloudiness over Greece could be sufficiently monitored with the establishment of 22 ground-based instruments. The spatial representativeness of the proposed sites is also assessed. The proposed number of stations could be considered as the basis to build the climatology of surface solar irradiance over Greece.","Surface solar irradiance,Satellite derived estimations,Ground-based monitoring network,Cluster analysis,"

"experimental study of propagation characteristic for maritime wireless communication","2012","Wireless communication is one of the most important communication system at sea. But insufficient knowledge of radio channel characteristics over sea limits the development of wideband wireless communication systems for maritime applications. In maritime communication, the presence of sea and nearby islands gives rise to multi-path fading. Due to the difficulties to determine base station position for maritime wireless communication and the cost of satellite communications in the marine environment, the analysis of propagation characteristics on coast and sea is very essential for broadband wireless communication.

Consequently, an increase in maintenance analytics studies for marine systems has been perceived. Due to the lack of reviews that encompass the body of knowledge of data-driven methodologies for the data pre-processing, fault diagnosis and prognosis of marine systems, this study aims to introduce the findings of a systematic literature review conducted on data-driven methodologies for three critical domains: 1) data pre-processing, 2) fault diagnosis, and 3) fault prognosis of marine systems. To determine the current state-of-the-art, a total of 88 primary studies published from 2016 to 2022 have been analysed and five research questions have been proposed. Examples of key findings are the advancements in the analysis of deep learning approaches, the quality of the data pre-processing methods, and the availability of fault data. Results of the systematic review indicate that advancements in Prognostics and Health Management (PHM), advancements in AI, and advancements in the creation of open-fault datasets are the main future work recommendations to be addressed in the upcoming years.","Artificial intelligence,Maritime transportation,Fault diagnosis,Data pre-processing,Prognostics and health management,"
"extraction of maritime road networks from large-scale ais data","2019","Extracting road network information including lane boundaries, lane centerlines, junctions and their relationship from AIS data plays an important role in location based services, urban computing and intelligent transportation systems, etc. However, AIS data are large scale, high noisy, the density and quality are very uneven in different areas, extracting a whole, continuous and smooth maritime road network with rich information from such data is a challenging problem. To address these issues, this paper proposes an adaptive maritime road network extraction approach that can extract both lane boundaries and centerlines for a large sea area from AIS data. Based on a road network definition including nodes, segments and segment curves, the approach designs parallel grid merging and filtering algorithms to determine if a grided area is inside lane or not. Lane boundaries are smoothed through jagged edge filtering and Simple Moving Average algorithms before centerline extraction. We evaluate our method based on real world AIS data in various area across the world's seas. Experimental results show the advantage of our method beyond the close related work.","continuous maritime road network,centerline extraction,trajectory computing,urban computing,segment curves,intelligent transportation systems,Noise measurement,moving average algorithms,road network,visual analysis,lane centerlines,spatio-temporal data mining,world AIS data,lane boundaries,marine engineering,Merging,adaptive maritime road network extraction approach,trajectory data mining,feature extraction,Artificial intelligence,roads,AIS data,Roads,Trajectory,road network information,large-scale AIS data,traffic engineering computing,location based services,Data mining,Junctions,smooth maritime road network,"
"research on detection mechanism of vessel abnormal behavior based on immune genetic spectral clustering algorithm","2022","Maritime transport accounts for over 90% of global trade, and maritime safety has been confirmed as a vital issue of maritime transport. Accordingly, vessel traffic service system (VTS) is capable of assisting the maritime department to complete real-time supervision of a certain water area and increasing the efficiency of water supervision. However, the VTS system has low effectiveness in vessel anomaly detection and supervision, thus resulting in regulatory blind spot in the VTS system. In this study, a vessel trajectory anomaly detection mechanism is developed using the immune genetic spectral clustering method. Moreover, the contour coefficient of scatter clustering is accurately analyzed, and the clustering center is optimized using the adopted method. On that basis, different abnormal features can be detected, and abnormal detection accuracy can be increased. In this study, the vessel trajectory anomaly detection model is built in accordance with the set sliding window and abnormal threshold parameters of vessel trajectory characteristics. The AIS data of Lianyungang to Qingdao port from March 2021 are selected for experimental analysis. The results suggest that the proposed method outperforms the conventional method in the detection accuracy and the false alarm rate, it facilitates the intelligent and automatic management of vessels by the VTS system.","Immune genetic,Abnormal behavior detection,Automatic identification system (AIS),Spectral clustering,Duplicato-degree measurement,Intelligent vessel supervision,"
"shipping log data based container ship fuel efficiency modeling","2016","Container shipping lines have been initiating various ship fuel efficiency management programs because bunker fuel costs always dominate the daily operating costs of a container ship. As the basis of these kinds of programs, we develop a viable research methodology for modeling the relationship between the fuel consumption rate of a particular container ship and its determinants, including sailing speed, displacement, sea conditions and weather conditions, by using the shipping log data available in practice. The developed methodology consists of an outlier-score-based data preprocessing procedure to tackle the fuzziness, inaccuracy and limited information of shipping logs, and two regression models for container ship fuel efficiency. Real shipping logs from four container ships (two with 13000 TEUs and two with 5000 TEUs) over a six-month sailing period are used to exhibit the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed methodology. The empirical studies demonstrate the performance of three models for fitting the fuel consumption rate of a ship and the industrial merits of ship fuel efficiency management. In addition, we highlight the potential impacts of the models developed in this study on liner shipping network analysis, as these models can serve as base models for additionally considering the influence of displacement and weather conditions on ship fuel efficiency and exhaust emissions.","Displacement,Ship fuel efficiency modeling,Outlier analysis,Weather condition,Sailing speed,Shipping log,"
"high fidelity digital twin-based anomaly detection and localization for smart water grid operation management","2023","Smart Water Grid (SWG) plays a critical role in sustaining cities economic and social development, but challenges remain in fully realizing the benefits of SWG. While Digital twin (DT) has been discussed in some literature for possible SWG applications, there has been limited, or no technical framework developed to facilitate SWG operation and management. In this paper, a generic framework is developed for constructing SWG high fidelity Digital Twin (DT) by integrating digital thread with various digital models for visualization, data-driven analysis, physics-based simulations, and decision-making support. Both the physics-based models and data-driven models are trained/retrained and calibrated/re-calibrated respectively by using the data collected with the sensors installed throughout a SWG. The information derived from the SWG DT can be diagnostic, predictive, and prescriptive to significantly augment users’ intelligence for improving SWG operation and management. One important application of digital twin augmented intelligence is illustrated to timely detect and localize anomaly events, which may include, but not be limited to, pipe bursts and unauthorized water usages. The solution is tested on the selected areas in Singapore to construct the ever-green DT by calibrating and recalibrating the models for near real-time SWG operation management. The case study was conducted for three supply zones with the total pipeline length of more than 1000 km and 40 weeks of monitoring data, collected by 89 pressure monitoring stations and 8 flow meters at inlets and boundary. More than 3300 data-driven models are trained for optimizing the model performance to achieve accuracy of greater than 80% F1 score for detecting anomaly events, which are subsequently localized within 400 m with 2–3 days lead time.","Data analytics,Anomaly localization,Smart water grid,Anomaly detection,Machine learning,Digital twin,"
"assessing the range of radio maritime links in different waterbodies: effect of antenna height and band diversities","2021","In this paper, we analyze the weather information for 14 waterbodies from geographical areas with different meteorological characteristics. We estimate the sub-hourly instances of the evaporation duct height (EDH) throughout a period of 10 years. Then, considering the frequency range 1 to 6 GHz, based on the parabolic equation method, we analyze the quality for a presumed shore-to-ship link throughout 100 km range. We evaluate the maximum range that can be supported for different reliability requirements and we focus specifically on analyzing the gain that can be obtained when antenna height and/or band diversity are used. It was found that for high reliability requirements, the antenna height at the shore is the main factor on deciding the maximum communication range that can be maintained. On the other hand, for applications that tolerate delay and work seasonally on an opportunistic basis, the evaporation duct statistics is the main factor deciding the likelihood of increasing the link range and establishing over-the-horizon communications.","telecommunication network reliability,Antennas,evaporation duct height distributions,reliability requirements,Ducts,Delays,Conferences,microwave antennas,EDH,Reliability,Vehicular and wireless technologies,time 10.0 year,size 100.0 km,antenna height diversity,shore-to-ship communications,band diversities,Meteorology,band diversity,statistical analysis,maximum communication range,parabolic equation method,link range,frequency 1.0 GHz to 6.0 GHz,meteorological characteristics,evaporation duct height,evaporation duct statistics,weather information,radio maritime links,over-the-horizon communications,shore-to-ship link,parabolic equations,marine communication,geographical areas,water bodies,antenna height,"

"iuu safe havens or psma ports: a global assessment of port state performance and risk","2023","The 2009 Port State Measures Agreement (PSMA) was the first legally binding international instrument to empower port States to deny foreign vessels suspected of having engaged in illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing from using their ports and to land catches. This paper builds upon previous work analyzing 2020 AIS data to rank fishing ports globally and assessing evolving port State risk and port States performance in PSMA implementation. Internal and external indicators were identified to highlight the port States at risk of becoming exposed to IUU fishing transactions. This paper includes an analysis of designated port use, a key requirement of PSMA implementation. The paper also establishes an ongoing methodological framework for port associated IUU risk assessment using the outputs as a benchmark against which follow-up trend analyses are planned, the next using 2023 data. Port rankings evolved because of continued AIS adoption, port State business diversification and Covid-19 related disruptions. 3% of commercial port calls globally are made by foreign vessels. Globally, internal port State risk has dropped, while external risk has increased, the former driven by parties to the PSMA, and the latter by PSMA non-parties. Higher-risk fleets are now diverting to PSMA non-parties. The findings underline the transformational nature of the Agreement. Overall port State risk correlates more strongly with quality of governance than with national income. The paper finds that the PSMA’s designated port entry rule for foreign vessels is currently weakly applied in advanced economies whilst it is more strongly applied across the developing world.","Port State performance,Illegal,unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing,Automatic identification system (AIS),Risk analysis,Ranking of fishing ports,Agreement on Port State Measures,"

"glaciations and paleoclimate of mount erciyes, central turkey, since the last glacial maximum, inferred from 36cl cosmogenic dating and glacier modeling","2009","Forty-four boulders from moraines in two glacial valleys of Mount Erciyes (38.53°N, 35.45°E, 3917m), central Turkey, dated with cosmogenic chlorine-36 (36Cl), indicate four periods of glacial activity in the past 22ka (1ka=1000 calendar years). Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) glaciers were the most extensive, reaching 6km in length and descending to an altitude of 2150m above sea level. These glaciers started retreating 21.3±0.9ka (1σ) ago. They readvanced and retreated by 14.6±1.2ka ago (Lateglacial), and again by 9.3±0.5ka ago (Early Holocene). The latest advance took place 3.8±0.4ka ago (Late Holocene). Using glacier modeling together with paleoclimate proxy data from the region, we reconstructed the paleoclimate at these four discrete times. The results show that LGM climate was 8–11°C colder than today and moisture levels were somewhat similar to modern values, with a range between 20% more and 25% less than today. The analysis of Lateglacial advance suggests that the climate was colder by 4.5–6.4°C based on up to 1.5 times wetter conditions. The Early Holocene was 2.1–4.9°C colder and up to twice as wet as today, while the Late Holocene was 2.4–3°C colder and its precipitation amounts approached to similar conditions as today. Our paleoclimate reconstructions show a general trend of warming for the last 22ka, and an increase of moisture until Early Holocene, and a decrease after that time. The recent glacier terminates at 3450m on the northwest side of the mountain. It is a remnant from the last advance (possibly during the Little Ice Age). Repeated measurements of glacier length between 1902 and 2008 reveal a retreat rate of 4.2m per year, which corresponds to a warming rate of 0.9–1.2°C per century.",""
"automatic identification of maritime incidents from unstructured articles","2018","In this paper, we present two Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for identifying maritime incidents described in unstructured articles from multiple sources. The first technique is a document classification scheme that determines if an article describes a maritime incident. Two variations of each article are created: the first only contains the article's title, the other contains the title and content. These are converted to both binary and frequency bags-of-words. Furthermore, two feature selection methods are tested: Weka's CfsSubsetEval and retaining the 300 most frequent words. Each dataset is tested with 41 classifiers from the Weka suite, with the most accurate classifiers including Logistic Regression (98.5%), AdaBoostM1(BayesNet) (98.33%), and RandomForest (97.56%). The second technique performs information extraction on an article to determine the location of the maritime incident. In addition to using regular expressions and Named Entity Recognition (NER), the approach focuses its attention on sentences that contain piracy keywords as well as sentences which occur earlier in the article.

"a hybrid approach on generating correlated sea clutter for maritime radar test","2016","Test, measurement and verification of radar are necessary to ensure function according to specification and meet customer requirements. Extensive field tests are often required to test an entire radar system. This is not only expensive, but also requires a great deal of time. To reduce test complexity and cost, simulation techniques are used to recreate real-world conditions in a laboratory environment. Many subsystems can be tested by radar target generators simulating radar echo signals. They usually consider Swerling models, but struggle to simulate clutter, or in particular sea clutter. This paper introduces an approach to generate sea clutter with a state of the art vector signal generator. It shows common approaches modeling sea clutter and introduces a novel approach to combine the statistical models with a physical ocean surface model.

"artinali++: multi-dimensional specification mining for complex cyber-physical system security","2021","Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSes) have been investigated as a key area of research since they are the core of Internet of Things. CPSs integrate computing and communication with control and monitoring of entities in the physical world. Due to the tight coupling of cyber and physical domains, and to the possible catastrophic consequences of the malicious attacks on critical infrastructures, security is one of the key concerns. However, the exponential growth of IoT has led to deployment of CPSes without support for enforcing important security properties. Specification-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) have been shown to be effective for securing these systems. Mining the specifications of CPSes by experts is a cumbersome and error-prone task. Therefore, it is essential to dynamically monitor the CPS to learn its common behaviors and formulate specifications for detecting malicious bugs and security attacks. Existing solutions for specification mining only combine data and events, but not time. However, time is a semantic property in CPS systems, and hence incorporating time in addition to data and events, is essential for obtaining high accuracy. This paper proposes ARTINALI++, which dynamically mines specifications in CPS systems with arbitrary size and complexity. ARTINALI++ captures the security properties by incorporating time as a substantial property of the system, and generate a multi-dimensional model for the general CPS systems. Moreover, it enhances the model through discovering invariants that represent the physical motions and distinct operational modes in complex CPS systems. We build Intrusion Detection Systems based on ARTINALI++ for three CPSes with various levels of complexity including smart meter, smart artificial pancreas and unmanned aerial vehicle, and measure their detection accuracy. We find that the ARTINALI++ significantly reduces the ratio of false positives and false negatives by 23.45% and 73.6% on average, respectively, over other dynamic specification mining tools on the three CPS platforms.","Cyber-Physical Systems,Safety,Specification mining,Intrusion Detection Systems,Program analysis,Security,"
"improving group transit schemes to minimize negative effects of maritime piracy","2014","Contemporary maritime piracy around the Horn of Africa presents a serious threat to the global shipping industry. A number of countermeasures were deployed to minimize the probability of a successful ship hijack, one of them being the establishment of the International Recommended Transit Corridor (IRTC). Currently, all ships transiting the Gulf of Aden are recommended to follow the IRTC and take part in group transit schemes (GTSs)-prescribed fixed schedules stating a time of arrival to the beginning of the corridor and a speed at which to sail through the corridor. We provide a number of contributions that improve the GTS: we formalize the grouping problem, we design an efficient algorithm able to compute optimal fixed GTSs with respect to the distribution of ships' speeds, we provide a real-world data set with speeds of ships transiting the IRTC, and we compare the optimal fixed schedules with the currently deployed schedule and quantify possible savings. Additionally, we propose on-demand GTSs-customized schedules for a group of arriving ships-that take into account speeds, risk aversion, and actual positions of arriving ships. We formulate the problem of the optimal on-demand grouping as a biobjective mixed integer program, and we compute a set of Pareto optimal solutions.

"petrogeochemical assessment of rock units and identification of alteration/mineralization indicators using portable x-ray fluorescence measurements: applications to the fire tower zone (w-mo-bi) and the north zone (sn-zn-in), mount pleasant deposit, new brunswick, canada","2017","The Mount Pleasant polymetallic deposits are located along the southwestern margin of the Late Devonian Mount Pleasant Caldera Complex in southwestern New Brunswick, Canada. The Fire Tower Zone (W-Mo-Bi) and the North Zone (Sn-Zn-In) comprise the main mineralized zones within the Mount Pleasant deposit. The rock units examined at surface in both zones are highly altered and are surface weathered to some extent. In order to classify these rock units with confidence, the Olympus X-5000 portable X-ray Fluorescence (pXRF) spectrometer was used in this study to rapidly obtain the geochemical composition of these rocks, identify lithologic discriminants, and find alteration/mineralization indicators in these areas. The immobile elements Ti, Zr, Nb, Y, and Th were selected to discriminate among various rock types. The Little Mount Pleasant Formation has the highest Ti and Zr and the Mount Pleasant Granitic Suite (MPGS, GI and GII) contains the highest Y, Nb, and Th. The McDougall Brook Granitic Suite (MBGS) has an intermediate composition between them. The element ratios of Zr/Ti, Nb/Ti, Y/Ti, and Th/Ti effectively discriminate these rock units and increase from the Little Mount Pleasant Formation, to the MBGS, and then to the MPGS. Greisen and propylitic alteration are reflected by strong depletion of K and Rb in some samples. The Fe and Mn typically are leached out of the mineralization system during the greisen alteration. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed on the pXRF datasets. The first principal component (PC1) of the pXRF data from both the Fire Tower Zone and the North Zone mainly extracts information on Ti, Zr, Ce, Cr, V, Nb, Y, U, and Th, and thus represents different rock units. The PC2 is characterized by high-positive loadings of K, Rb, Fe, and Mn and negative loading of As and Mo. It is interpreted as the W-Mo mineralization indicator showing by the enrichment in Mo and depletion of K, Rb, Fe, and Mn associated with quartz+topaz+sericite+fluorite alteration. The PC3 consists of positive loadings of Sn, Zn, Cu, and S and slightly negative loadings of Sr and Ba, and thus represents the Sn-Zn mineralization in this area.","Immobile elements,Lithogeochemistry,XRF,PCA,Mount Pleasant deposit,"
"the long-term assessment of air quality on an island in malaysia","2018","This study aims to evaluate the air quality on Langkawi Island, a famous tourist destination in Malaysia, using 13 years of data (1999–2011) recorded by the Malaysian Department of Environment. Variations of seven air pollutants (O3, CO, NO, NO2, NOx, SO2 and PM10) and three meteorological factors (temperature, humidity and wind speed) were analysed. Statistical methods used to analyse the data included principal component regression (PCR) and sensitivity analysis. The results showed PM10 was the dominant air pollutant in Langkawi and values ranged between 5.0 μg m−3 and 183.2 μg m−3. The patterns of monthly values showed that the concentrations of measured air pollutants on Langkawi were higher during the south-west monsoon (June–September) due to seasonal biomass burning activities. High CO/NOx ratio values (between 28.3 and 43.6), low SO2/NOx ratio values (between 0.04 and 0.12) and NO/NO2 ratio values exceeding 2.2 indicate the source of air pollutants in this area was motor vehicles. PCR analysis grouped the seven variables into two factor components: the F1 component consisted of SO2, NO and NOx and the F2 component consisted of PM10. The F1 component (R2 = 0.931) indicated a stronger standardized coefficient value for meteorological variables compared to the F2 component (R2 = 0.059). The meteorological variables were statistically significant (p < 0.05) in influencing the distribution of the air pollutants. The status of air quality on the island could be improved through control on motor vehicle emissions as well as collaborative efforts to reduce regional air pollution, especially from biomass burning.","Environmental science,Atmospheric science,"

Recent advances in long-term vessel motion modeling through Ornstein-Uhlenbeck mean-reverting stochastic processes allow to encode knowledge about maritime traffic via a compact graph-based model where waypoints are graph vertices and the connections between them, i.e., the navigational legs, are graph edges. The resulting directed graph ultimately leads to the detection and statistical characterization of recurrent maritime traffic patterns.

"target identification in complex maritime scenes","1997","There are a growing number of civilian and military applications where it is necessary to obtain identification and tracking information of marine vessels that are manoeuvring in a complex maritime scene. The driving force behind this research is the need for surveillance and safety, particularly within harbours, where many maritime incidents and accidents occur. The research work developed here identifies and tracks maritime vessels moving within the narrow confines of a harbour entrance. Using a number of consecutive image frames, a hierarchical statistical motion pyramid is constructed, this is used to extract motion at different levels within each image. To identify and track the vessels as they move in the image a high-level reasoning process is used. This process associates the extracted motion dynamics at the different levels within the pyramid with the vessels concerned. This paper describes algorithms which use a visual based hierarchical motion scheme to identify and track multiple maritime vessels, typically boats and ships moving within a harbour scene.","visual based hierarchical motion scheme,consecutive image frames,image sequences,surveillance,harbours,civilian application,hierarchical statistical motion pyramid,extracted motion dynamics,complex maritime scenes,tracking,high-level reasoning process,Image sequence analysis,ships,marine vessels,military application,identification,boats,maritime vessels,"
"deep reinforcement learning based uav-assisted maritime network computation offloading strategy","2022","As maritime activities become more frequent, many computationally intensive applications have emerged. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be utilized to provide computing services for maritime networks. In this paper, a multi-UAV assisted mobile edge computing (MEC) network is designed.

The goal is to minimize the maximum processing delay of the multi-VAV assisted MEC network. We present an optimization problem for joint task offloading, resource allocation, and flight trajectory of UAVs. The above problem is an mixed non-integer linear programming problem (MINLP), which is transformed into a Markov decision process (MDP).

"low cost planetary exploration: surrey lunar minisatellite and interplanetary platform missions","2001","In order to meet the growing global requirement for affordable missions beyond Low Earth Orbit, two types of platform are under design at the Surrey Space Centre. The first platform is a derivative of Surrey's UoSAT-12 minisatellite, launched in April 1999 and operating successfully in-orbit. The minisatellite has been modified to accommodate a propulsion system capable of delivering up to 1700 m/s delta-V, enabling it to support a wide range of very low cost missions to LaGrange points, Near-Earth Objects, and the Moon. A mission to the Moon - dubbed “MoonShine” - is proposed as the first demonstration of the modified minisatellite beyond LEO. The second platform - Surrey's Interplanetary Platform - has been designed to support missions with delta-V requirements up to 3200 m/s, making it ideal for low cost missions to Mars and Venus, as well as Near Earth Objects (NEOs) and other interplanetary trajectories. Analysis has proved mission feasibility, identifying key challenges in both missions for developing cost-effective techniques for: spacecraft propulsion; navigation; autonomous operations; and a reliable safe mode strategy. To reduce mission risk, inherently failure resistant lunar and interplanetary trajectories are under study. In order to significantly reduce cost and increase reliability, both platforms can communicate with low-cost ground stations and exploit Surrey's experience in autonomous operations. The lunar minisatellite can provide up to 70 kg payload margin in lunar orbit for a total mission cost US$16–25 M. The interplanetary platform can deliver 20 kg of scientific payload to Mars or Venus orbit for a mission cost US$25–50 M. Together, the platforms will enable regular flight of payloads to the Moon and interplanetary space at unprecedented low cost. This paper outlines key systems engineering issues for the proposed Lunar Minisatellite and interplanetary Platform Missions, and describes the accommodation and performance offered to planetary payloads.",""
"an approach for safety assessment of highly automated systems applied to a maritime traffic alert and collision avoidance system","2019","Traffic density at sea has constantly grown over the last years due to rising shipping of goods. As a consequence it has become a more and more difficult task for the ship's operating crew to assess a traffic situation and anticipate its future development. Automated collision avoidance systems can assist the crew in this task to reduce the number and severity of accidents. Such a system is the MTCAS (Maritime Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System). Before safety-critical systems like this can go to market they have to undergo a verification and validation process to ensure safety. An important part of this process is the hazard and risk assessment. In this paper we review the state of the art of existing methods for hazard and risk assessment with regard to their applicability to highly automated systems. After identifying the limitations of existing methods we propose a new method especially tailored for highly automated systems and exemplary apply it to MTCAS.","ship operating crew,marine accidents,Maritime Collision Avoidance,MTCAS system,hazard assessment,goods distribution,safety-critical systems,verification process,good shipping,ships,marine safety,traffic density,validation process,automated collision avoidance systems,risk analysis,safety assessment,automated systems,collision avoidance,Safety and Risk Assessment,Maritime Traffic Alert,"

The goal is to provide energy efficiency management with digital indicators that have not been easily provided. The ship navigation information platform (SNIP) is developed to determine the dynamic information of each ship, including the fuel consumption, ship speed, horsepower of the engine, rotation speed of the engine, wind direction, and wind speed. In addition, model test data and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) calculation data are applied to calculate the energy efficiency performance indicators. Finally, the relationship of the speed through water and the speed over ground enables us to modify the effects of the ocean currents. The results verify that these indicators can be used as a reference for performance monitoring and maintenance prediction of international maritime affairs.","Hull and propeller maintenance,ISO 19030,Energy efficiency management,"
"preparation of in-service measurement data for ship operation and performance analysis","2020","An increasing number of ships are being equipped with sensors and devices for monitoring of operational behavior, and the amount and access to operational data is gradually increasing. Due to various reasons described in this paper, the operational data may contain erroneous data points that are critical to assess prior to performing data analysis or building mathematical and statistical models. In this paper, a stepwise method for preparation of data for ship operation and performance analysis is presented. The method deals with removing jumps in the time series data, including loss of time synchronization between different measurement subsystems, outlier detection, including repeated samples, dropouts and spikes and data selection and extraction, including stationarity detection. The final result is a data set free from disturbances, distortions and undesired physical effects, that can be used to improve the quality of a ship operation and performance analysis.","Outlier detection,Data extraction,Data preprocessing,Data preparation,Synchronization,Steady state detection,"

"designing intelligent coastal surveillance based on big maritime data","2020","The ocean is classified into several territorial regimes that span from internal waters, archipelagic waters, territorial seas, contiguous zones, exclusive economic zones (EEZ), and high seas. The relevant state authorities must perform surveillance of all ships that navigate through their respective territories to ensure the ship safety and prevent them from carrying out illegal activities such as illegal unregulated and unreported (IUU) fishing, illegal firearms smuggling, and piracy. Currently, maritime domain surveillance is carried out using a combination of Automatic Identification System (AIS), Coastal Radar System (CRS), and Long Range Camera (LRC). The massive amount of incoming data from these surveillance systems produce big maritime data. However, big maritime data is useless without artificial intelligence intervention. This research proposed an intelligent system that provides and analyzes ship path planning, identifies suspicious ships, track ships, and approaches and attacks target ships using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm.

"traffic knowledge discovery from ais data","2013","Maritime Situational Awareness (i.e., an effective understanding of activities in and impacting the maritime environment) can be significantly improved by knowledge discovery of maritime traffic patterns. The recent build-up of terrestrial networks and satellite constellations of Automatic Identification System (AIS) receivers provides a rich source of cooperative vessel movement information. This vast amount of information can not be fully utilized by human operators and poses new storage and computational challenges. A compact representation of this rapidly increasing amount of information gives operational utility to data which would otherwise be ignored. This paper proposes an unsupervised and incremental learning approach to extract the historical traffic patterns from AIS data. The presented methodology called Traffic Route Extraction for Anomaly Detection (TREAD) effectively processes raw AIS data to infer different levels of contextual information, spanning from the identification of ports and off-shore platforms to spatial and temporal distributions of traffic routes. Furthermore, the accurate understanding of the historical traffic enables the classification and prediction of vessel behaviours as well as the detection of low-likelihood behaviours, or anomalies. The ultimate goal is to provide operators with a configurable knowledge framework supporting day by day decision making and general awareness of vessel pattern of life activity. The methodology is demonstrated via a real-world case study, which can be used as a reference data set for further analysis.","data mining,raw AIS data,traffic route extraction for anomaly detection,Vectors,TREAD,unsupervised learning,operational utility,maritime traffic patterns,unsupervised learning approach,incremental learning approach,low-likelihood behaviours,maritime situational awareness,automatic identification system,Knowledge discovery,marine engineering,Entropy,traffic information systems,configurable knowledge framework,traffic knowledge discovery,Trajectory,Receivers,Surveillance,Data mining,historical traffic patterns,"

"ship speed power performance under relative wind profiles in relation to sensor fault detection","2018","Statistical data analysis and visualization approaches to identify ship speed power performance under relative wind (i.e. apparent wind) profiles are considered in this study. Ship performance and navigation data of a selected vessel are analyzed, where various data anomalies, i.e. sensor related erroneous data conditions, are identified. Those erroneous data conditions are investigated and several approaches to isolate such situations are also presented by considering appropriate data visualization methods. Then, the cleaned data are used to derive various relationships among ship performance and navigation parameters that have been visualized in this study, appropriately. The results show that the wind profiles along ship routes can be used to evaluate vessel performance and navigation conditions by assuming the respective sea states relate to their wind conditions. Hence, the results are useful to derive appropriate mathematical models that represent ship performance and navigation conditions. Such mathematical models can be used for weather routing type applications (i.e. voyage planning), where the respective weather forecast can be used to derive optimal ship routes to improve vessel performance and reduce fuel consumption. This study presents not only an overview of statistical data analysis of ship performance and navigation data but also the respective challenges in data anomalies (i.e. erroneous data intervals and sensor faults) due to onboard sensors and data handling systems. Furthermore, the respective solutions to such challenges in data quality have also been presented by considering data visualization approaches.","Speed power performance,Data anomaly detection,Sensor fault identification,Weather routing,Ship wind profile,Statistical data analysis,"
"reversals of the geomagnetic field, magnetostratigraphy, and relative magnitude of paleosecular variation in the phanerozoic","1976","The percentage of normal and reversed magnetization in land-based paleomagnetic studies of Phanerozoic rocks (0 to − 570 m.y.) have been compiled in order to determine the long-term variation in polarity bias of the geomagnetic field. Where possible the results are compared with the record from marine magnetic anomalies. Only rarely is there an even balance between normal and reversed polarity. During the past 350 m.y. two quiet intervals can be recognized when few reversals occurred, the Cretaceous (KN about − 81 to − 110 m.y.) and Permo-Carboniferous (PCR about − 227 to − 313 m.y.). Less firmly established are two other quiet intervals, one in the Jurassic (JN about − 145 to − 165 m.y.), and one in the Triassic (TRN about − 205 to − 220 m.y.). Between these quiet intervals there are disturbed intervals when reversals were comparatively frequent. From − 680 to − 350 m.y. the paleomagnetic record is inadequate to delineate a succession of quiet and disturbed intervals although one is probably present. Maximum entropy spectral analysis reveals three periodicities, a dominant one at about 300 m.y. and others, less well-defined, at 113 and 57 m.y. The variations in polarity bias are compared with the paleosecular variation, and it is shown that the magnitude of the paleosecular variation is greater in disturbed than in quiet intervals. This indicates that the magnitude of paleosecular variation and polarity bias are governed by variations in the balance between non-dipole and dipole components of the field, and that these variations probably had their origin in processes near the core—mantle interface. The correspondence between the dominant periods of 300 m.y. and plate tectonics is noted and a causal relationship suggested.",""
"a framework for maritime anti-collision pattern discovery from ais network","2019","The avoidance of collisions between ships in encounter situations is crucial to maritime traffic safety. Most research on maritime collision avoidance has focused on planning a safe path by which to avoid approaching ships in accordance with the requirements laid out in the International Regulations for Preventing Collision at Sea (COLREGs). The resulting solution provides reference for the navigator in planning movements to avoid collisions. Nonetheless, specific anti-collision actions are generally based on the experience of the navigator. This study differed from existing works in that we sought to derive collision avoidance behavior from the trajectory data of actual ships. The Automatic Identification System (AIS) network makes it possible to collect an enormous volume of trajectory data and investigate real-world ship behavior. Unfortunately trajectory data that introduces uncertainty can hinder behavior mining for collision avoidance. Irregular and/or asynchronous location sampling can lead to situations in which the movement of a ship does not necessarily follow a given trajectory, even if its movement behavior is similar to that of other ships. In this study, we developed a framework to decipher the anti-collision behavior of ships in encounter situations from a large database of trajectory data collected by AIS network, and to present this behavior in the form of anti-collision patterns. A prototype of the proposed framework was built to enable pattern analysis and visualization functions, thereby providing a deeper understanding of collision avoidance behavior in maritime traffic. The proposed framework is applicable to the development of pattern-aware collision avoidance systems aimed at improving maritime traffic safety.","maritime conflict detection,real-world ship behavior,Safety,Marine vehicles,ship anti-collision pattern,pattern-aware collision avoidance systems,ship trajectory data,behavior mining,AIS network,ships,marine safety,maritime collision avoidance,Collision avoidance,Artificial intelligence,automatic identification system network,Trajectory,collision avoidance behavior,anti-collision behavior,International Regulations for Preventing Collision at Sea,maritime traffic safety,Navigation,collision avoidance,Data mining,maritime anti-collision pattern discovery,"
"chapter 6 - the complex dynamics of renewable energy innovation system in tunisia","2021","This chapter seeks to give a better understanding of the complexity of reconstructing the hidden endogenous innovation cycle in the currently complicated instable domain of Tunisia’s energy transition. We aim to evaluate whether energy innovation cycle dynamics analysis in Tunisia helps boost energy efficiency and transition performance to sustainability. Indeed, we suggest to work on both simulation and prediction approaches of chaotic systems to understand how energy innovation cycle genesis and control can contribute to an adequate future situation of sustainable clean renewable energy transition. We will focus more on modeling and analysis of its nonlinear dynamical system from a conceptualized and methodological point of view. As a result, we find that the reconstructed phase space of Rössler’s system and the bifurcation diagram are perfectly adequate to demonstrate the genesis of endogenous cycle of the innovation dynamical system inspired from Goodwin’s work. Similarly, studying the dynamics complexity of the endogenous innovation cycle of a clean renewable energy system does not only serve as a possible helping factor for understanding the transition policy via adopting a sustainable energetic future strategy in Tunisia but also as an efficient actor for controlling the complexity and stability of energy transition dynamical system. Therefore it is a right decision criterion for the successful regulation and the planning for every necessary strategic policy intervention for any sustainable development. This goal is especially based on integrate of innovation in the renewable energy transition system.","endogenous innovation cycle,simulation,Rössler’s system,Complexity,energy transition in Tunisia,"

"numerical simulations of debris drift from the great japan tsunami of 2011 and their verification with observational reports","2018","A suite of five ocean models is used to simulate the movement of floating debris generated by the Great Japan Tsunami of 2011. This debris was subject to differential wind and wave-induced motion relative to the ambient current (often termed “windage”) which is a function of the shape, size, and buoyancy of the individual debris items. Model solutions suggest that during the eastward drift across the North Pacific the debris became “stratified” by the wind so that objects with different windages took different paths: high windage items reached North America in large numbers the first year, medium windage items recirculated southwest toward Hawaii and Asia, and low windage items collected in the Subtropical Gyre, primarily in the so-called “garbage patch” area located northeast of Hawaii and known for high concentrations of microplastics. Numerous boats lost during the tsunami were later observed at sea and/or found on the west coast of North America: these observations are used to determine optimal windage values for scaling the model solutions. The initial number of boats set adrift during the tsunami is estimated at about 1000, while about 100 boats are projected to still float in year 2018 with an e-folding decay of 2 to 8 years.","Sensitivity to windage,Data analysis,Tsunami debris,Ocean surface circulation,Debris pathways,Model-data comparison,Model calibration/validation,New methods,Numerical modeling,Debris reports,Marine debris drift,"

"fatigue life prediction of corrosion-damaged high-strength steel using an equivalent stress riser (esr) model: part i: test development and results","2009","The fatigue life of metallic aircraft structural components can be significantly reduced by environmentally induced corrosion. As part of a NAVAIR High Strength Steel Corrosion–Fatigue Assessment Program, methods were studied to predict the impact that corrosion-induced surface roughness has on the fatigue life of high-strength steel aircraft components. In order to adequately capture the corrosion damage features that cause fatigue cracking, a representative set of well-characterized corrosion–fatigue test results were generated to be used for model development. The test specimens fabricated for this program consisted of bare, unnotched AF1410 steel flat plates with a 25.4mm diameter corrosion patch on one side. Two sets of test specimens were fabricated and tested, with one set abrasive blasted after heat treatment, and the other set hand polished after heat treatment. A method of growing corrosion in the laboratory was developed that consisted of filter paper soaked in a 3.5% NaCl solution and placed at the center of the test plate gage section, with a voltage applied across the filter paper to accelerate corrosion growth. High-resolution 3D surface topography data was collected from the corroded region on each test plate prior to fatigue testing using a commercial white-light interference microscope. Constant-amplitude fatigue tests were performed on corroded and uncorroded test plates at several different stress levels, for three different corrosion exposure levels. Post-test fractographic analysis of the corroded specimens indicate that all of the critical cracks originated from small corrosion notches on the order of 10–200μm in width, 10–120μm in height and 2–100μm in depth. These notches were not considered to be pits in that the depth dimension was less than the surface dimensions. The repeatability of the fatigue initiating mechanism for corrosion damaged surfaces in this material indicates that it should be possible to develop a single modeling approach that reasonably captures the effects of corrosion notches in reducing fatigue life.","Corrosion fatigue,Life prediction,Notches,Probabilistic analysis,Fatigue initiation,"

They also fulfil important cultural, recreational and aesthetic needs; have intrinsic ecosystem service values; and provide essential biogeochemical functions such as primary productivity, nutrient cycling and water filtration. The rapid expansion in economic development and anticipated growth of the population in the coastal zones along the Yellow and East China Sea basin has placed this region under intense multiple stresses. Here we aim to: 1) synthesize the new knowledge/science in coastal oceanography since 2010 within the context of the scientific literature published in English; 2) report on a citation analysis that assesses whether new research topics have emerged and integrated over time, indicate the location of modelling and field-based studies; and 3) suggest where the new research should develop for heavily impacted estuaries and coastal seas of East Asia. The conclusions of the synthesis include: 1) China has emerged as a dominant force in the region in producing scientific literature in coastal oceanography, although the area of publications has shifted from its traditional fields such as physical oceanography; 2) there has been an increasing number of publications with cross-disciplinary themes between physical oceanography and other fields of the biological, chemical, and geological disciplines, but vigorous and systematic funding mechanisms are still lacking to ensure the viability of large scale multi-disciplinary teams and projects in order to support trans-disciplinary research and newly emerging fields; 3) coastal oceanography is responding to new challenges, with many papers studying the impacts of human activities on marine environment and ecology, but so far very few studying management and conservation strategies or offering policy solutions.","Yellow Sea and East China Sea,Japan,conservation,Taiwan,Korea,physical and biogeochemical processes,management,coastal oceanography,China,"
"geospatial analysis of oil discharges observed by the national aerial surveillance program in the canadian pacific ocean","2014","Oil pollution resulting from day to day human maritime activities contributes a high portion of the overall input into marine environments, constituting a major threat to marine ecosystems worldwide. In Canada, the National Aerial Surveillance Program (NASP) extensively monitors and collects information on oily discharges using remote sensing devices. Despite the availability of data from NASP and other surveillance programs internationally, there is a paucity of spatial analyses of oil pollution patterns, particularly in their association with human marine pursuits. The objective of this paper is to analyze the association between observed oily discharges and human maritime activities in the Canadian Pacific Ocean. This study used Poisson regression to spatially model detected oily discharges with marine traffic, coastal facilities and proximity to coast. Further, it developed localized (‘regional’) models to address spatial heterogeneity. The models identify recreational activities, passenger traffic, commercial traffic, fisheries, and proximity to the coast as predictors of observed oily discharges. The regional models yield more accurate and reliable estimates of local associations, and identify more parsimonious sets of predictors for each region. By identifying and accounting for human activities most associated with oily discharge patterns, the models developed in this study could be used to estimate pollution rates in areas with less surveillance, and identify areas where NASP coverage may need to be increased. Spatially explicit rates estimated by these models can be used to monitor the effectiveness of programs and policy aimed at reducing discharge rates of oily pollution. This study can be used as a model approach for extending the analysis to the other coasts of Canada, using available NASP data.","Prediction,Spatial analysis,Oil pollution,Aerial surveillance,Canadian Pacific Ocean,Poisson regression,"
"modeling of interferences on other satellites in maritime satellite communications","2013","In maritime mobile satellite communications, mechanically controlled tracking systems are used to compensate changes of antenna orientation due to changes of a ship attitude caused by waves or winds of the sea. Orientations of antennas on a ship are limited so that transmitted electromagnetic waves are not affected by structures on the ship. Thus it is allowed to transmit waves when a clearance angle is greater than certain criteria. Our group has researched about fundamental relation between clearance angles and interferences for other satellites or other systems on the ship by numerical simulations for a simplified model. In this report, a realistic ship model is assumed for the simulations. As a result, a clearance angle, which interferences to the receiving satellite are small, has been found out under the conditions of the simulations. A simple model which describes interferences to received levels of the aiming and neighboring satellites is presented.","Satellites,interference model,maritime,satellite receiving,electromagnetic wave transmission,Marine vehicles,Satellite antennas,Bridges,antenna orientation,interference,Transmitting antennas,Satellite communications,ship structures,numerical simulations,mobile radio,reception level,radiofrequency interference,mobile antennas,tracking systems,ship attitude,Receiving antennas,ship antenna,marine communication,maritime mobile satellite communications,diffracted wave,numerical analysis,"

Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping (STCW) requires the trainees to be assessed and deemed competent in maritime mathematics, a New Zealand Qualifications Authority (NZQA) Level 3 course with 15 credits is to assess for competency in maritime mathematics in the following six topics: Algebra, Mensuration, Graphs, Calculus, Geometry, Trigonometry. Until end of 2021, the program specific regulations allow open entry for domestic students and no mathematics access criteria for international students. This means that the students start their maritime mathematics class at varying levels of proficiency. However, all learning outcomes in six maritime mathematics topics must be achieved for a student to be deemed competent by completion of their training programs. A study is conducted to identify the gaps caused by the open entry policy, based on observation of interaction of teaching and learning with results in course final exam, to analyze the weakness of the current teaching contents and start Maritime Mathematics course renovation in maritime training programs in New Zealand. This study has contributions to Programme Change Application, which has been approved by NZQA at end of 2021, that Applicants must meet the following criteria for admission into the programme Applicants with no seagoing experience: 14 credits in either Mathematics (calculus, algebra or equivalent) and/or Physics. As the programme Applicants with seagoing experience still have no mathematics access criteria, this study has led to the production of a new Industry-oriented teaching strategy to the course development in 2022.

"a novel non-stationary 6g uav channel model for maritime communications","2021","To achieve space-air-ground-sea integrated communication networks for future sixth generation (6G) communications, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications applying to maritime scenarios serving as mobile base stations have recently attracted more attentions. The UAV-to-ship channel modeling is the fundamental for the system design, testing, and performance evaluation of UAV communication systems in maritime scenarios. In this paper, a novel non-stationary multi-mobility UAV-to-ship channel model is proposed, consisting of three kinds of components, i.e., the line-of-sight (LoS) component, the single-bounce (SB) components resulting from the fluctuation of sea water, and multi-bounce (MB) components introduced by the waveguide effect over the sea surface. In the proposed model, the UAV as the transmitter (Tx), the ship as the receiver (Rx), and the clusters between the Tx and Rx, can be seen as moving with arbitrary velocities and arbitrary directions. Then, some typical statistical properties of the proposed UAV-to-ship channel model, including the temporal autocorrelation function (ACF), spatial cross-correlation function (CCF), Doppler power spectrum density (PSD), delay PSD, angular PSD, stationary interval, and root mean square (RMS) delay spread, are derived and investigated. Finally, by comparing with the available measurement data, the accuracy of proposed channel model is validated.","UAV communication systems,statistical properties,root mean square delay spread,Channel models,delay PSD,RMS delay spread,6G,Ducts,Surface waves,sea surface,temporal autocorrelation function,nonstationary 6G UAV channel,non-stationarity,UAV-to-ship channel modeling,Sea measurements,maritime scenarios,LoS component,statistical analysis,single-bounce components,Atmospheric modeling,6G communications,stationary interval,UAV transmitter,arbitrary velocities,ship receiver,arbitrary directions,Doppler power spectrum density,Sea surface,nonstationary multimobility UAV-to-ship channel model,proposed channel model,6G mobile communication,multi-mobility,line-of-sight component,wireless channels,UAV channels,mobile base stations,autonomous aerial vehicles,channel statistical properties,correlation methods,unmanned aerial vehicle communications,Unmanned aerial vehicles,future sixth generation communications,marine communication,spatial cross-correlation function,multibounce components,waveguide effect,space-air-ground-sea integrated communication networks,maritime communications,"

In this paper, the key tradeoffs in designing a scanning maritime radar are presented with details of how the radar return can be simulated. The sea clutter model is a compound Gaussian model with the spectrum modelled using the evolving Doppler spectrum model with an appropriate representation of the texture. This is important as the Doppler spectrum plays a key role in determining the statistics that are important for coherent processing.

"low-cost, intelligent drifter fleet for large-scale, distributed ocean observation","2022","We have developed Persistent Environmental Awareness Reporting and Location (PEARL) ocean drifters. PEARL drifters are small, rugged, low-cost, autonomous, environmentally friendly ocean drifters that represent a significant opportunity for high-impact applications in both national security and environmental ecosystem monitoring. Drifters record and report data which is processed by advanced edge analytics before being compressed for satellite transmission to populate a large data repository with sensor data that is combined and analyzed to discover signals of interest in the ocean environment with the goal of increasing distributed maritime awareness. Each drifter is entirely self-contained, powered by solar panels and backup batteries, with a large array of sensors, compute module for onboard data processing, and satellite modem for data reporting. The drifter architecture is flexible and can be customized for a specific purpose. The complete data record is stored locally and processed by the onboard compute module, which runs anomaly detection algorithms that detect nearby activity. Anomalous events, as well as baseline environmental data, are reported to a cloud database using satellite short burst data transmission. Though each independent drifter is a powerful sensing tool, the low unit cost permits large scale deployment. To date thousands of drifters have been deployed over vast areas of the ocean and are reporting data to a remote database where cloud-based analytics algorithms develop global situational awareness and update local edge algorithms on the drifters based on learnings across the full network.","Satellites,data reporting,remote sensing,distributed ocean observation,complete data record,environmental ecosystem monitoring,Location ocean drifters,lagrangian drifter,intelligent drifter fleet,high-impact applications,anomaly detection,maritime domain awareness,drifter architecture,Persistent Environmental Awareness Reporting,Distributed databases,environmental data,vessel tracking,satellite communication,marine systems,Turning,oceanographic equipment,sensor data,advanced edge analytics,onboard compute module,cloud computing,ocean circulation,baseline environmental data,satellite transmission,Oceans,geophysics computing,data reduction,ocean environment,maritime awareness,satellite modem,data repository,edge processing,PEARL drifters,oceanographic regions,onboard data processing,Roads,cloud-edge algorithms,Cloud computing,national security,satellite short burst data transmission,Sensors,environmentally friendly ocean drifters,oceanographic techniques,"
"the declining impact of piracy on maritime transport in the indian ocean: statistical analysis of 5-year vessel tracking data","2015","The analysis of the declining impact of piracy on maritime routes and vessel behaviours in the Indian Ocean is here performed using Long Range Identification and Tracking (LRIT) reports. A 5-year archive of vessel position data covering the period characterized by the highest number of attacks and the subsequent decline provides a unique source for data-driven statistical analysis that highlights changes in routing and sailing speeds. The work, besides demonstrating the value of LRIT data for statistical maritime traffic analysis, can be used to ultimately provide quantitative support to the estimates of the additional fuel consumption due to piracy. In showing the return of the North–South traffic to the shortest path, the results testify to the effectiveness of the efforts put in place against piracy in the Western Indian Ocean.","Maritime surveillance,Long Range Identification and Tracking (LRIT),Maritime piracy,Knowledge discovery,Maritime routes,"

"hierarchical maritime radio networks for internet of maritime things","2019","Despite the potential benefits of a maritime Internet of Things, a number of issues hinder its realization, including the need for wide area coverage and cost-effectiveness. Toward these needs, a model is first presented for uplink maritime radio communications that hierarchically employ Wi-Fi and cellular links for data transmission from marine user equipments (MUEs) on a ship to a cellular base station with distributed antennas (DAs) along a coastline. Then, the performances are evaluated given in terms of average data rate and outage probability in the hierarchical maritime radio networks. When evaluating the performances, heterogeneous channel characteristics of the hierarchical networks are taken into account in which Rayleigh fading is considered for the MUE-ship links, whereas shadowed-Rician fading is considered for the ship-DA links. Moreover, the effects due to various transmission errors that can be occurred at different communication layers are reflected in determining the quality of service (QoS) requirements of a ship. With the help of authors' analysis, an antenna selection algorithm is proposed under which the minimum size of a service cloud can be found to support the QoS requirements of MUEs with a ship. The numerical evaluations demonstrate the validity of the proposed algorithm.","Data communication,Antennas,Rayleigh channels,shadowed-Rician fading,data transmission,distributed antenna (DA),cellular links,quality of service,Marine vehicles,hierarchical maritime radio networks,wireless communication,MUE-ship links,average data rate,outage probability,marine user equipments,hierarchical networks,Quality of service,Internet of maritime thing (IoMT),Rician channels,cellular radio,Oceans,Radio networks,data minimization,maritime Internet of Things,Cellular networks,quality of service (QoS),radio networks,wireless channels,wireless LAN,wide area coverage,Wi-Fi link,uplink maritime radio communications,probability,marine communication,ship-DA links,Internet,cellular base station,radionavigation,maritime communications,"

"fault diagnosis for induction generator-based wind turbine using ensemble deep learning techniques","2022","Fault diagnosis in induction machines (IM) require effective detection at early stages to prevent permanent machine failure. This requires fast sensing of disturbances as well as efficient diagnosis methods. Conventional signal measuring techniques are usually intrusive, sensitive, with a low signal-to-noise ratio, and may show limited performance at incipient fault stages. Moreover, traditional machine learning (ML) diagnosis techniques based on handcrafted feature extraction methods suffer from limitations that can be overcome by deep learning (DL) with automatic feature extraction capabilities. In this paper, an online, non-intrusive method is proposed for fault diagnosis in a three-phase IM based on infrared imaging. The proposed method integrates three convolutional neural network (CNN)-based DL models (Inception, Xception, and MobileNet) to identify IM health status, fault types, and stator Inter-turn faults (ITF) location and severity. Deep features obtained from these CNNs are merged through Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) resulting in spatial-time-frequency features. This fusion reduces the input features’ size and improves diagnostic accuracy. Merged features’ length is further reduced using the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) where these reduced features are then used for classification. Compared to DL-based diagnosis methods introduced in previous work, the proposed method shows superior performance. First, it uses the IR images directly without the need for clustering and segmentation steps, thus saving time and effort. Moreover, ensembled DL is applied via combining the three CNNs benefits altogether rather than applying an individual DL method. Finally, unlike the huge features’ number exhibited by previous studies, the proposed approach uses minimal features, thus reducing classification complexity and time while maintaining 100% classification accuracy.","Renewable energy generating,Wind energy​ sources,Ensemble deep learning,Classification,Infrared thermal imaging,Fault diagnosis,Wind turbine inter-turn faults,Condition monitoring,"

"the spring–neap variability and mechanisms of long-term variations in the upwelling at the tip of liaodong peninsula, china","2022","Upwelling is one of the important phenomena in oceans which plays a significant role in marine hydrology and marine ecological systems. During the summer stratified season, there are usually cold patches around the tip of Peninsula. Using the satellite sea surface temperature (SST) data from 1999 to 2018, this study showed that there was a pod-like cold water patch with two cold centers around the tip of Liaodong Peninsula, China. The range and the intensity of upwelling indicated an increasing trend during 1999–2018. We used a two-dimensional hydrodynamic model Mike21 to study the impact of the tidal current to the intra-month variations of upwelling (DHI 2009). The variability of tidal currents brought the significant spring–neap variations of the upwelling, showing that the SST of upwelling during the spring tide was lower about 1°C and the range of the cold water extended farther than that during the neap tide. The variations of upwelling area lagged behind the tide range about 4 days. The mechanisms of long-term variations of the upwelling were analyzed using the remote sensing wind data and the reanalysis ocean current data. Summer surface wind in the Bohai Sea suppressed the upwelling through the inshore Ekman transports and the effect of the wind curls could be ignored. The dispersion of geostrophic current around the Laotieshan Channel due to the bottom friction could drive the upward vertical velocities. Both of wind and current contributed to the multi-year variations of the upwelling around the tip of Liaodong Peninsula, China.","Current,Spring–neap variation,Wind,Upwelling,Liaodong Peninsula,Tide,China,"
"characterization of a transmitter in a medium frequency maritime terrestrial navigation system","2019","Due to the worldwide recognition of increased jamming and spoofing events, which threaten the usability of global navigation satellite systems (GNSS), positioning systems using signals of opportunity are gaining importance as backup systems. Especially for maritime usage, a terrestrial system called Ranging-Mode (R-Mode) is under development. Among other signals, it utilizes the maritime medium frequency broadcasts of the differential GNSS (DGNSS) service. Currently, the estimation of phase in a time continuous medium frequency signal is used to determine the distance between transmitter and receiver. Here, the delay of a transmitter on the signal phase is of great interest, since it directly affects the performance of the R-Mode system. In this paper, the influence of a medium frequency power amplifier is characterized as part of the transmitter chain. The aim is to give the operators of DGNSS stations the possibility to characterize their station themselves when the R-Mode system is operational. Therefore, widely used measuring instruments are utilized, rather than using well-known cost-intensive techniques like phase delay measurements. A simple setup with different evaluation methods that fit this requirement is presented. Furthermore, it is capable of measuring the absolute time delay. The presented workflow was tested on an amplifier with output power of 100 W at the transmitter station near Koblenz, Germany.","R-Mode,terrestrial system,Delays,marine navigation,transmitter delay measurement,power amplifiers,phase delay measurements,Transmitters,DGNSS stations,jamming,global navigation satellite systems,synchronisation,Delay effects,satellite navigation,R-Mode system,transmitter chain,medium frequency power amplifier,power 100.0 W,time continuous medium frequency signal,medium frequency maritime terrestrial navigation system,signal phase,Ranging-Mode,backup systems,Time-frequency analysis,Oscilloscopes,spoofing events,differential GNSS service,maritime medium frequency broadcasts,transmitter station,radio transmitters,terrestrial navigation system,"

"identifying industrial heat sources using time-series of the viirs nightfire product with an object-oriented approach","2018","Carbon-based fuels burned at industrial facilities account for a large proportion of greenhouse gas emissions, and an up-to-date spatiotemporally detailed inventory is essential for a better understanding of global carbon emission patterns. The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Nightfire product offers a quantitative estimation of the temperatures of sub-pixel heat sources, providing the potential for detecting thermal anomalies from industrial sectors across the globe. However, identifying subcategories of various industrial heat sources is challenging because there are scarcely any stable and typical characteristics for their classification at a single thermal anomaly scale. Specifically, these nighttime thermal anomalies exhibit a strong spatiotemporal heterogeneity (e.g., fluctuations in retrieved temperature, spatial shifts in position, and presence of false positives), even in industrial heat sources that do not vary through time. Here, we demonstrate an object-oriented approach to robustly segment and accurately classify various industrial heat sources from a time-series of the VIIRS Nightfire product. The approach operates from the cluster level of spatially adjacent nighttime thermal anomalies (i.e., nighttime-heat-source objects rather than individual thermal anomalies) to generate fingerprint-like characteristics and to address the challenge of spatiotemporal heterogeneity. Specifically, the spatial-aggregation characteristic of nighttime thermal anomalies from continuously operating industrial heat sources and the temporal-aggregation characteristics of biomass burnings were incorporated to differentiate industrial nighttime-heat-source objects from ubiquitous biomass burnings. Subsequently, the similarity of the thermal signals of nighttime thermal anomalies from identical industrial heat sources was used to generate highly recognizable characteristics for their identification. A spatiotemporally detailed inventory of industrial heat sources across the globe was then established from this object-oriented classification. The inventory included a total of 15,199 industrial heat sources, representing 49.52% of all higher confidence nighttime thermal anomalies in the VIIRS Nightfire product. Validation of the results showed that only 218 objects (1.43%) were biomass burnings or active volcanoes that were misclassified as industrial heat sources. Further validation of sub-categories indicated an overall classification accuracy of ~77%. Our findings suggest that the VIIRS Nightfire product has great potential for monitoring the global distribution and dynamics of industrial heat sources, and combined with the object-oriented approach developed here the methodology is simple, robust, and cost-effective.","Nightfire product,Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS),Object-oriented analysis,Identification,Industrial heat sources,Time-series,"
"towards a method for the objective assessment of cognitive workload: a pilot study in vessel traffic service (vts) of maritime domain","2017","The complexity of traffic control systems, as well as the growing volume of traffic, interconnected missions types and mission demands on the operators, indicates that critical attention should still be paid to the problem of operator's cognitive workload (WL). On the other hand, the development of traffic control towards on-line measurement of cooperative aspects between humans and machines, is part of the more general need to measure the human agents â€œsituation awarenessâ€ in industrial environment. The University of Modena and Reggio Emilia was partner of the European Artemis project â€œDesigning Dynamic Distributed Cooperative Human-Machine Systemsâ€ (D3CoS 2011-2014) [1] to define affordable methods, techniques and tools addressing the specification, development and evaluation of cooperative systems where human and machine agents are in charge of common tasks, assigned to the system as a whole. One of the basic keys to reach an optimal human-machine cooperation is the measure of the human operator workload. In order to setup a possible method for the objective evaluation of cognitive workload we had to investigate aspects of the functional status of human operators interacting with a simulator in maritime domains. We recorded objective psycho-physiological measures: eye blinks, respiration rate and amplitude, electrodermal activity, heart rate variability, and blood pressure. They were analyzed and correlated with subjective self-assessed responses from two questionnaires: NASA-TLX and Rating Scale Mental Effort (RSME), with the aim to realize a mathematical model for classifying the operators' mental workload.

"chemical composition and provenance of chinese porcelain shards recovered from old goa, west coast of india","2017","During recent archaeological explorations at Old Goa, west coast of India, twenty three Chinese porcelain shards of the Ming (Middle to late 16th century), Qing (17th century) and late Qing period (late 17th century) have been recovered. In order to understand the nature and source of raw material and kilns, these shards were analysed for major elements with X-ray fluorescence (XRF), trace and rare earth elements by Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS). The analysis suggests that porcelain shards are siliceous in nature (SiO2~70%) and contain high Al2O3 (21.6%), Rb (388ppm) and Ba (160ppm) but have low Sr (48ppm). This composition suggests that the raw materials used for producing porcelain were silica, kaolinite and sericite which are characteristics of porcelains manufactured in Southern China. Comparatively, high Al2O3 (kaolinite) content in porcelains of the Qing Dynasty suggest improvement of quality, particularly mechanical strength, of Jingdezhen porcelain. In general, major element composition, trace metals, total rare earth elements (∑REE-67ppm) and their chondrite - normalized pattern of the Ming, Qing and late Qing period are nearly similar and appear to be made of identical raw materials.","Old Goa,Jingdezhen kiln,Chinese porcelain,Ming and Qing period,South China,Maritime trade,ICP-MS and XRF analysis,"

"predicting spatial kelp abundance in shallow coastal waters using the acoustic ground discrimination system roxann","2014","Kelp forests represent a major habitat type in coastal waters worldwide and their structure and distribution is predicted to change due to global warming. Despite their ecological and economical importance, there is still a lack of reliable spatial information on their abundance and distribution. In recent years, various hydroacoustic mapping techniques for sublittoral environments evolved. However, in turbid coastal waters, such as off the island of Helgoland (Germany, North Sea), the kelp vegetation is present in shallow water depths normally excluded from hydroacoustic surveys. In this study, single beam survey data consisting of the two seafloor parameters roughness and hardness were obtained with RoxAnn from water depth between 2 and 18 m. Our primary aim was to reliably detect the kelp forest habitat with different densities and distinguish it from other vegetated zones. Five habitat classes were identified using underwater-video and were applied for classification of acoustic signatures. Subsequently, spatial prediction maps were produced via two classification approaches: Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and manual classification routine (MC). LDA was able to distinguish dense kelp forest from other habitats (i.e. mixed seaweed vegetation, sand, and barren bedrock), but no variances in kelp density. In contrast, MC also provided information on medium dense kelp distribution which is characterized by intermediate roughness and hardness values evoked by reduced kelp abundances. The prediction maps reach accordance levels of 62% (LDA) and 68% (MC). The presence of vegetation (kelp and mixed seaweed vegetation) was determined with higher prediction abilities of 75% (LDA) and 76% (MC). Since the different habitat classes reveal acoustic signatures that strongly overlap, the manual classification method was more appropriate for separating different kelp forest densities and low-lying vegetation. It became evident that the occurrence of kelp in this area is not simply linked to water depth. Moreover, this study shows that the two seafloor parameters collected with RoxAnn are suitable indicators for the discrimination of different densely vegetated seafloor habitats in shallow environments.","seafloor mapping,underwater habitats,macroalgae forests,hydroacoustics,Helgoland,"
"the response of metal mobilization and redistribution to reoxygenation in baltic sea anoxic sediments","2022","To bring life back to anoxic coastal and sea basins, reoxygenation of anoxic/hypoxic zones has been proposed. This research focuses on the metals released during the oxidization of sediments from two locations in the anoxic Eastern Gotland Basin under a laboratory-scale study. Triplicate experimental cores and reference cores were collected from the North and South Eastern Gotland Basins. The oxygenation of the water column took place over a 96-hour experiment in a dark and 5 °C environment. In 12 and 24 hour intervals, the surface waters were exchanged and, over time, analyzed for pH, electroconductivity (EC), total organic carbon (TOC), soluble metal concentrations, and the top samples (0–10 cm) were analyzed with 3-step (E1: water-soluble, E2: exchangeable, and E3: organic-bound) sequential chemical extraction (SCE). Results show stable pH and decreasing EC in the column waters. The EC indicates that metals are released in the initial phases (12 h) of reoxygenation for both sites. Arsenic, Ba, Co, Mn, Rb, U, K, Sr, and Mo are released into the water column during the 96 hour experiment, and based on the calculations for the entire East Gotland Basin, would mean 8, 50, 0.55, 734, 53, 27, 347,178, 3468, and 156 μg L−1 are released, respectively. Elements Mn, Mo, U, and As are released in higher concentrations during the experiment than previously measured in the Eastern Gotland Basin, which provides vital information for future proposed remediation and natural geochemical processes with their known environmental impacts. The SCE results show that redox-sensitive metals (Mn, U, and Mo) are released in the highest concentrations into the solution. The relationship between the highest released metals (beside redox-sensitive) into solution over the oxygenation and their initial abundant phase is noticed, where the smallest released concentrations belong to K < Rb < Sr in E2, and As<Ba in E3, respectively.","Remediation,Eutrophication,Anoxic,Metal contamination,Water contamination,Sequential chemical extraction,"
"system architecture for real-time condition monitoring and anomaly detection on ships","2023","Sea-based rescue organizations play a vital role in maritime civil security by resolving offshore emergencies, securing sea routes, and monitoring critical naval infrastructure. However, increasing marine traffic makes rescue operations more difficult, demanding better organization and orchestration of available resources. Therefore, ensuring efficient maintenance, availability and timely deployment of rescue cruisers is of great importance, particularly in rough sea conditions. To achieve this, we design an AI-based system for predictive maintenance and condition monitoring that enables real-time analyses of the shipâ€™s sensory data and the detection of anomalies in the system behavior. In this paper, we detail our software and hardware architecture for these purposes, and we discuss the respective requirements regarding onboard and off-ship data analysis from various data sources (sensor data, camera data, weather data). We underpin our approach by emulating data flows derived from sensory data. Finally, we provide the first results in AI-based anomaly detection, allowing, for instance, early engine malfunctions identification before the actual failure occurs.","Machine Learning,Condition Monitoring,Computer architecture,Systems architecture,Soft sensors,Real-time systems,Anomaly Detection,Ship Sensory Data,Condition monitoring,System Architecture,Organizations,Hardware,"
"target extraction and imaging of maritime targets in the sea clutter spectrum using sparse separation","2017","Detection and imaging of endoclutter maritime targets is a difficult problem, because the signal return of the target and the clutter overlap in both Doppler frequency and time. Consequently, traditional Doppler filtering is severely limited in terms of extracting the target signature for further processing. This letter proposes a new sparsity-based Doppler filtering and extraction paradigm for maritime radar where the different backscattered signals are separated in the endoclutter region based on their Doppler bandwidths rather than their Doppler frequencies. The novelty of this letter is successful extraction of the target profiles in the endoclutter region using the application of morphological component analysis with time-frequency transforms. Illustrative results of the proposed approach for boat Doppler profile extraction and inverse synthetic aperture image formation outperform traditional range-Doppler processing in endoclutter. The method represents a new paradigm for target detection and imaging in sea clutter.","marine radar,target imaging,Inverse synthetic aperture radar,radar detection,backscattered signals,target detection,sea clutter,inverse synthetic aperture image formation,Dictionaries,Doppler bandwidths,endoclutter maritime targets,extraction paradigm,Doppler frequency,object detection,synthetic aperture radar,feature extraction,maritime radar,radar imaging,Doppler effect,morphological component analysis,Bandwidth,image filtering,target signature,clutter,Doppler radar,Boats,Clutter,time-frequency analysis,time-frequency transforms,backscatter,sparsity-based Doppler filtering,boat Doppler profile extraction,signal return,"
"gis-enabled maritime awareness system (gmas)","2009","Being aware of maritime activities is important for homeland security. We have worked with the US Coast Guard to develop a waterway visual surveillance system on Elba Island, in Savannah, GA for maritime awareness. With the system, we developed an enhanced temporal difference algorithm based on active zone (ETD-AZ) to detect waterway moving objects, including container ships, commercial vessels, small vessels, sailboats, tugboats, and dolphins, etc. In the algorithm, active zone is first defined to model the imaging locations of moving objects that appear in the waterway; the model reduces noises caused by winds, clouds, and waves in the near-view fields. A thresholded difference map is computed by using temporal difference and thresholding methods. The thresholded difference map is further processed by applying morphological operations to remove noises. A final decision rule is derived to decide whether an image contains moving objects or not based on motion pixels in thresholded difference map and in the difference map after morphological operation. The proposed ETD-AZ algorithm has been tested using 21, 844 night and day images taken from Aug. 1-2, 2008, in different weather conditions: sunny, cloudy, windy, stormy with lightening, etc. The algorithm detected 89 of 94 waterway moving objects with 5.3% false negative rate while maintaining a low false positive rate of 4.0% for a total of 21, 478 non-object images. When focusing only on vessels, it detected 78 of 79 moving vessels with a 1.3% false negative rate.","homeland security,waterway visual surveillance system,enhanced temporal difference-active zone algorithm,Active noise reduction,Savannah,image motion analysis,Marine vehicles,Clouds,US Coast Guard,Elba Island,moving object location imaging,military systems,video surveillance systems,waterway moving object detection,GMAS,GIS-enabled maritime awareness system,military computing,Containers,marine safety,object detection,Dolphins,Wind,geographic information systems,ETD-AZ algorithm,national security,Morphological operations,Object detection,Surveillance,video surveillance,maritime activities,thresholded difference map,Terrorism,"
"characterising marshland temporal dynamics using remote sensing: the case of bolboschoenetum maritimi in doñana national park","2019","This work examines the temporal dynamics of macrophytes present in the Doñana National Park marshland (SW Spain), represented by the plant association Bolboschoenetum maritimi. The characterisation of the seasonal and inter-annual dynamics of these vegetation masses was carried out through the analysis of biweekly NDVI time series from MODIS over a 16-year period (2000–2015). The NDVI provides information regarding the status of vegetative cover. Different indicators of seasonal dynamics were obtained through the NDVI time series, such as: annual mean (NDVI-I), relative range (RREL), maximum and minimum values (MAX and MIN), and months of MAX and MIN (MMAX and MMIN), which were evaluated as indicators of the seasonal variation of the vegetation and of its response to variations in the rainfall and flooding regimes of the marshland. Results showed a strong dependence on the flooding processes of the marshland, requiring a minimum rainfall threshold (350 mm/year) for proper development. Furthermore, a strong correlation (R2 = 0.70; p < 0.05) was found between the seasonal nature of the vegetation masses, measured using RREL, and the accumulated rainfall during the flooding period of the marshland. Slightly weaker relationships between rainfall and other indicators such as the minimum and maximum annual NDVI (R2 = 0.61 and R2 = 0.43; p < 0.05, respectively) were also found.","NDVI,Macrophytes,Rainfall,Remote sensing,Ecosystems functioning,MODIS,"

Simulations offshore Somali coast and in a South Mediterranean Sea region showed that both low and high resolution acquisitions are feasible. For the low resolution mode a probability of successful image formation no matter the azimuth position of the receiving UAS has been estimated at nearly 100%. Whereas, for the high resolution mode it decreases to about 90%, which, if deemed unsatisfactory for the application, leads to the need for UAS to adapt its route to the actual Galileo satellite coverage.","Unmanned aerial systems,Bistatic synthetic aperture radar,Parasitic remote sensing,Civil security,Galileo constellation,"
"a generic approach to analysing failures in human – system interaction in autonomy","2020","Autonomous systems operation will in the foreseeable future rely on the interaction between software, hardware and humans. Efficient interaction and communication between these agents are crucial for safe operation. Conventional methods for hazard identification and safety assessment focus often on one of the aspects of the system only, e.g., human reliability, software failures, or equipment reliability. The method Human-System Interaction in Autonomy (H-SIA) was recently proposed, focusing on autonomous ships operation and collision scenarios. H-SIA provides a framework for analyzing autonomous ship operation as an entirety, rather than each agent separately. The method comprised initially of two main elements: An Event Sequence Diagram (ESD) and a Concurrent Task Analysis (CoTA). While the ESD models the events that can take place following an initiating event, the CoTA models which tasks the agents must perform for these events to succeed. This paper extends H-SIA to include the paths to failure, through the development of Fault Trees (FTs), which is necessary for risk analysis and identification of risk reduction measures. The FTs development of H-SIA introduces novelties in comparison to common FTs: (i) they model the system as whole, (ii) they are generic and can accommodate a diversity of systems designs; (iii) they lead to basic failure events. The FTs allows for identification of failure events arising through interaction between autonomous ship and human operators, as well as failure propagation through these agents. The basic failure events are applicable for different autonomous concepts. A case study on autonomous ship collision demonstrates the use of the extended method. The case study illustrates H-SIA’s applicability to different designs and levels of autonomy, its potential for identification of failure events, and its use in risk assessments.","System design,Human-autonomy interaction,Risk assessment,Autonomous systems,Autonomous ship,"
"the lama system: a “smart” magnetometer network for harbour protection","2022","This work describes the development of an underwater anti-intrusion system based on a magnetometer self-informed network, whose purpose is to detect the presence of threats in the proximity of critical infrastructures (e.g, terrorist divers in harbours). In this context, the magnetic network fills the gaps of sonar systems at the critical boundaries of the water volume to be controlled (sea bed, docks, …), where acoustic performances deteriorate due to reflections and attenuations. The system operates in a port-protection scenario, characterized by a medium-high environmental magnetic noise that can hide the diver signal (a diver is a weak, quasi-point-like, moving source). The magnetometer network processes two inputs: the environmental magnetic noise and a signal including the target magnetic signal superimposed to the same noise; the frequencies of a diver signal lie within the noise band, hence frequency filtering proves inadequate for noise removal. The basic idea underlying the system is to measure and use the noise itself to filter the overall signal; measuring noise supports a background-subtraction process that allows to extract the target signal and therefore detect the threat presence. The effectiveness of the procedure depends on the positions of magnetometers: sensors must be close enough to one another to measure the common background noise, and, at the same time, should be distant enough from one another so that just one sensor can measure the target signal. To generate alarms when a threat is detected, a real-time software application processes data and activates a visual and acoustic alarm upon identification of a magnetic anomaly. Sea trials carried out in port areas provided extremely satisfactory results in the detection of intruders. The paper presents experimental results obtained during the method validation tests, when intruders were moving in the surrounding undersea environment.","Environmental magnetism,Marine geophysics,Time series analysis,Magnetic anomaly detection,Underwater magnetic systems,Harbour protection,"
"upper mississippi pb as a mid-1800s chronostratigraphic marker in sediments from seasonally anoxic lakes in eastern canada","2013","Sediment cores from eight headwater lakes located in Southern Québec, Eastern Canada, were analyzed for Pb, stable Pb isotopes, and the radioelements 210Pb, 137Cs, 241Am and 226Ra. The depth profiles of stable Pb isotope ratios show, for the post-19th century period, the influence of several isotopically distinct anthropogenic lead sources, mainly including emissions from two Canadian smelters and from leaded gasoline combustion in Canada and in the United States. A most interesting feature of the profiles, however, is the presence of sharp stable Pb isotope ratio peaks near the depth horizon, where excess 210Pb becomes undetectable. Using a binary mixing model and assuming that natural Pb concentrations and isotopic compositions from the catchment are given by the pre-industrial sediments at the bottom of the cores, we find that a significant part of the anthropogenic Pb supplied to the sediments at this horizon originated from smelting activities in the Upper Mississippi Valley. We assess that the Pb isotope ratio peaks, also observed in the laminated sediments of the Pettaquamscutt Estuary, Rhode Island, USA, are an accurate chronostratigraphic marker for the validation of mid-19th century 210Pb-derived dates. Given that the study lakes are located up to 2000km from the Mississippi Valley, we conclude that this isotopic Pb signal provides a widely distributed time-marker that is key to validate 210Pb chronologies in environmental archives from Eastern North America.",""
"reliability analysis with corrosion defects in submarine pipeline case study: oil pipeline in ab-khark island","2022","The offshore industry widely uses offshore pipelines to transport petroleum products due to their high capacity and reasonable installation costs. Corrosion is the leading failure cause of offshore pipelines, and their reliability analysis is necessary for reducing maintenance costs.

"characterization of an episode with elevated ozone concentrations","1976","A detailed analysis has been made of a seven day period in 1973, during which elevated ozone levels were observed at Ottawa. In addition to the ozone data, results are also presented for oxides of nitrogen, carbon monoxide, methane, total hydrocarbons and particulate matter. The particulates were analyzed for seven constituents, including the cations ammonium, calcium, sodium, potassium and lead and the anions sulfate and nitrate. Also measured were several other properties of the particulates, including the size distribution. It was found that none of the other gaseous pollutants showed any increase in concentration when high ozone levels were present. In contrast, the particulate matter did increase and several constituents, notably ammonium and sulfate, showed a dramatic rise. A comparison with ozone data from Toronto and upper New York state showed that the high ozone concentrations were widespread. A meteorological analysis showed that elevated ozone levels were associated with a Tropical air mass with a moderate southwesterly flow of air. Trajectory calculations were carried out to show the origin of the air over Ottawa before, during and after the period of increased ozone.",""

"single image defogging based on illumination decomposition for visual maritime surveillance","2019","Single image fog removal is important for surveillance applications, and, recently, many defogging methods have been proposed. Due to the adverse atmospheric conditions, the scattering properties of foggy images depend on not only the depth information of scene but also the atmospheric aerosol model, which has a more prominent influence on illumination in a fog scene than that in a haze scene. However, the recent defogging methods confuse haze and fog, and they fail to consider fully the scattering properties. Thus, these methods are not sufficient to remove fog effects, especially for images in maritime surveillance. Therefore, this paper proposes a single image defogging method for visual maritime surveillance. First, a comprehensive scattering model is proposed to formulate a fog image in the glow-shaped environmental illumination. Then, an illumination decomposition algorithm is proposed to eliminate the glow effect on the airlight radiance and recover a fog layer, in which the objects at the infinite distance have uniform luminance. Second, a transmission-map estimation based on the non-local haze-lines prior is utilized to constrain the transmission map into a reasonable range for the input fog image. Finally, the proposed illumination compensation algorithm enables the defogging image to preserve the natural illumination information of the input image. In addition, a fog image dataset is established for the visual maritime surveillance. The experimental results based on the established dataset demonstrate that the proposed method can outperform the state-of-the-art methods in terms of both the subjective and objective evaluation criteria.

"recent geomorphological evolution of channel bar in magdalena river (colombia) due to natural and anthropogenic interferences","2022","The growing establishment of port structures in estuarine regions has resulted in alternated sedimentation patterns and new geoforms. The primary purpose of this study is to understand the recent formation and geomorphological evolution of the fluvial bar in the final portion of the Magdalena River. The geomorphological evolution analysis was made possible using Geographic Information Systems tools, satellite images, and bathymetric data. The studied bar formed and stabilized through anthropic and natural factors such as port structures (obstacles to sediment transport), channel morphology, and natural- and anthropic-caused variation to the sediment supply. The lateral bar formation, adjacent to port structures, began in 2017 with surface runoff accumulating and anchored on the riverbank since 2018. At present, the bar covers 45% of the original river width, and an approximate sediment volume worth 4,000,000 m3 has accumulated. Changes in the navigable channel result in slope modification from 2.02° to 5.36°. The construction of port structures, i.e. new pile bridges, changes the natural sediment flow, because they are obstacles, trapping sediments downstream. This period coincides with the end of a weak El Niño cycle, subsequent to a La Nina period also of low intensity, with reduced precipitation rates resulting in a decrease in flow, and therefore contributing to an increase in sedimentation. The observations suggest that it is crucial to understand the channel bars' morphology and origin to avoid possible economic and social impacts due to the disruptions in navigation.","Bathymetry,Satellite images,Navigation,Fluvial,Sedimentation,"

The 11-year and 23-year overlapping means of global (δtg) as well as northern (δtn) and southern (δts) hemispheric SST anomalies reveal significant positive correlation with both Rz and aa indices. Rz, aa and δtg depict a similar trend in their long-term variation and both seem to be on increase after attaining a minimum in the early 20th century (∼1905). Whereas the results on the power spectrum analysis by the Multi-Taper Method (MTM) on δtg, Rz and aa reveal periodicities of ∼79–80 years (Gleissberg's cycle) and ∼9–11 years (Schwabe solar cycle) consistent with earlier findings, MTM spectrum analysis also reveals fast cycles of 3–5 years. A period of ∼4.2 years in aa at 99% confidence level appears recorded in δtg at ∼4.3 years at 90% confidence level. A period of ∼3.6–3.7 years at 99% confidence level found in δtg is correlating with a similar periodic variation in sector structure of Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF).

"self-adaption vessel traffic behaviour recognition algorithm based on multi-attribute trajectory characteristics","2020","Clustering analysis is commonly used for vessel traffic behaviour recognition. The clustering results reflect the characteristics of different vessel traffic behaviours, which can assist authorities in transportation management. However, there are two drawbacks to traditional clustering analysis. First, the similarity measures among different trajectories in a clustering analysis mainly focus on spatial differentiation and frequently do not consider motion features, such as speed and course. Second, the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm, a famous clustering analysis method, is characterized by poor self-adaption, which means that it cannot autonomously determine the best parameters based on different sample sets. These issues limit the efficiency of clustering analysis. To address these problems, a new similarity measure using statistical methods and based on multi-attribute trajectory characteristics is proposed to reflect the similarity among different trajectories. The proposed measure considers the spatial and motion features of trajectories. Furthermore, the Parzen window (a non-parametric estimation method) and the multivariate Gaussian distribution are employed to generate self-adaptive strategies to determine the optimal parameters of the DBSCAN algorithm for a given sample set. Finally, numerical experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed similarity measure and improved DBSCAN algorithm. The clustering analysis results obtained with the proposed method could provide insights towards better monitoring and navigation advice to help improve marine managerial effectiveness and avoid maritime accidents.","Vessel behaviour recognition,Self-adaption,Multi-attribute trajectory characteristics,DBSCAN,"

Ebinur Lake is an important component of the ecological barrier of Junggar Basin, Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR), China.

The detection of the intra-annual variations of water body and its responses to changing environment are critical for regional ecological security and rehabilitation of degraded ecosystem. To extract more accurate water information using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data and further fill the gap of inter-month dynamic monitoring of Ebinur Lake, a new SAR water index (modified Sentinel 1A water index, MSWI) was proposed based on the relationship between normalized difference water index (NDWI) imageries and Sentinel 1A data.

The maximum lake surface area was 965.29 km2 in April 22nd, 2017, while the minimum value was 750.37 km2 in September 1st, 2017, and the mean area was 831.51 km2. The seasonal variations showed the stages of “sharp rising” – “significant decreasing” – “gradual stabilizing” in the study period. The water surface area was highly correlated with inflow water volume (correlation coefficient = 0.72, P < 0.001). The variation of Ebinur Lake's water surface area is crucial to monitor the resulting eco-environmental impacts under the changing environmental conditions in the arid and semi-arid areas.","Ebinur Lake,Water index,Sentienel-1A,Remote sensing,Eco-environmental impact,"
"early warning obstacle avoidance-enabled path planning for multi-auv-based maritime transportation systems","2023","As a prototype of the underwater Internet of Things-enabled maritime transportation systems, multi-Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV)-based Underwater Wireless Networks (UWNs) have become an important research topic due to their distribution and robustness. In this paper, the concept of multi-AUV-based UWNs is first defined, where AUV is regarded as a network node, and communication among the AUVs is the potential network links. Then, to improve network scalability and controllability, a paradigm of Software Defined multi-AUV-based UWNs (SD-UWNs) is proposed, where the Software Defined Network (SDN) technique is used to upgrade the UWN architecture by directing intelligent network functions. Topology and artificial potential field theories are applied to construct a network control model for the SD-UWNs. Based on the efficient data sharing ability of the SD-UWNs, an early warning obstacle avoidance-enabled path planning scheme is proposed to guarantee safe sailing of the SD-UWNs, where comprehensive obstacle avoidance scenarios are taken into account. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method is effective in planning the cooperative operation for the SD-UWNs and is capable of performing accurate and reliable obstacle avoidance tasks.","Network architecture,intelligent network functions,Path planning,underwater Internet,autonomous underwater vehicle,accurate obstacle avoidance tasks,computer network security,Software Defined multiAUV-based UWNs,Underwater Internet of Things,comprehensive obstacle avoidance scenarios,remotely operated vehicles,Internet of Things,transportation,network node,Planning,safe sailing,underwater vehicles,network control model,software defined network,marine safety,UWN architecture,controllability,software defined networking,Collision avoidance,autonomous underwater vehicles,Software Defined Network technique,potential network links,Computer architecture,underwater acoustic communication,SD-UWNs,network scalability,Things-enabled maritime transportation systems,Wireless Networks,path planning,underwater wireless networks,Software,mobile robots,AUV,multiAutonomous Underwater Vehicle-based,Task analysis,early warning obstacle avoidance-enabled path planning scheme,collision avoidance,reliable obstacle avoidance tasks,multiAUV-based maritime transportation systems,"
"a quantitative accident analysis model on nuclear safety culture based on bayesian network","2022","As technology advances over time, systems and processes in industries have been becoming increasingly complex, and the likelihood of errors has been increasing in those work activities that workers perform without a proper understanding of them. In such an environment, a minor error in combination with weak barrier systems could lead to an unexpected accident. If a human error induced accident has failed to be prevented from occurring despite multiple barriers in place, then we should look for problems underlying in our organization. In the nuclear industry, however, accident cause analyses have been mostly focused on failed equipment, improper designs, or personal mistakes. In order to prevent recurrence, detailed cause analysis and timely corrective actions are crucial. It is also necessary to disseminate the lessons learned (i.e. operating experience) from accident analyses throughout the organization. High-reliability industries have experienced numerous near-misses and minor problems that might have otherwise resulted in major accidents. Due to organizational culture, however, lessons learned from such issues were often overlooked or considered insignificant to ensure that weaknesses could be identified in terms of safety culture (or organizational management). Therefore, methods are necessary to help analyze accidents in terms of safety culture. This paper proposes an accident analysis model based on a Bayesian network that can be used to quantitatively analyze root causes of an accident (or event) occurring at a nuclear power plant from the perspective of nuclear safety culture rather than equipment. For the purpose of this study, a case study was conducted on those actual events that had occurred at nuclear power plants. Sensitivity analysis was performed on the safety culture attributes categorized into individual, manager and system layers, which discovered more effective attributes for preventing accidents at nuclear power plants. If the analysis results of accidents (or events) at nuclear power plants based on this model are collected in an organization's database, the data may be used to monitor nuclear safety culture degradation signs and contribute to enhanced plant safety.","Case study,Bayesian Network,Nuclear Safety Culture,Nuclear Safety Culture Traits,Root Cause Analysis,Quantitative Analysis,"
"ocean of things : affordable maritime sensors with scalable analysis","2019","DARPA's Ocean of Things (OoT) program enables persistent maritime situational awareness over large ocean areas by deploying thousands of low-cost, intelligent floats that drift as a distributed sensor network. Each float manages a suite of commercially available sensors to collect environmental data such as sea surface temperature, sea state, and location as well as activity data about vessels and marine mammals moving across the ocean. The floats periodically transmit processed data, or immediately report events based on internal prioritization schemes. Messages travel via commercial satellite to a government cloud for storage and real-time analysis. Cloud-based data analytics feature machine learning aimed at discovering emergent features and behaviors from sparse data. The multiple performers manufacturing floats and developing software are being led by a government management team to employ commercial design methodology and agile best practices. At-sea float deployments are planned in two phases over 2019 (1-month) and 2020 (3-month). Program benefits include ocean environmental products derived from high-density, in-situ measurements and analytical applications, which can simultaneously provide users a range of outputs to include ocean circulation prediction, vessel and marine mammal tracking, and dynamic ocean resource management.","ocean areas,internal prioritization schemes,IoT,ocean temperature,commercial satellite,marine mammal tracking,persistent maritime situational awareness,cloud-based data analytics,Things program,Temperature measurement,cloud,drifters,DARPA's Ocean,Sea measurements,computerised monitoring,data acquisition,Data analysis,oceanography,intelligent floats,maritime situational awareness,vessel tracking,environmental data,target tracking,ocean circulation prediction,data analysis,OoT,oceanographic equipment,sea surface temperature,cloud computing,marine mammals,distributed sensors,ocean circulation,machine learning,wireless sensor networks,Oceans,real-time analysis,distributed sensor network,government management team,sparse data,government cloud,Cloud computing,marine communication,ocean environmental products,scalable analysis,Temperature sensors,Internet,dynamic ocean resource management,learning (artificial intelligence),affordable maritime sensors,sea state,floats,oceanographic techniques,"
"maritime pattern extraction from ais data using a genetic algorithm","2016","The long term prediction of maritime vessels' destinations and arrival times is essential for making an effective logistics planning. As ships are influenced by various factors over a long period of time, the solution cannot be achieved by analyzing sailing patterns of each entity separately. Instead, an approach is required, that can extract maritime patterns for the area in question and represent it in a form suitable for querying all possible routes any vessel in that region can take. To tackle this problem we use a genetic algorithm (GA) to cluster vessel position data obtained from the publicly available Automatic Identification System (AIS). The resulting clusters are treated as route waypoints (WP), and by connecting them we get nodes and edges of a directed graph depicting maritime patterns. Since standard clustering algorithms have difficulties in handling data with varying density, and genetic algorithms are slow when handling large data volumes, in this paper we investigate how to enhance the genetic algorithm to allow fast and accurate waypoint identification. We also include a quad tree structure to preprocess data and reduce the input for the GA. When the route graph is created, we add post processing to remove inconsistencies caused by noise in the AIS data. Finally, we validate the results produced by the GA by comparing resulting patterns with known inland water routes for two Dutch provinces.","data mining,Clustering algorithms,Genetic algorithms,vessel position data cluster,marine navigation,directed graph,maritime pattern extraction,sailing pattern analysis,quadtrees,Biological cells,genetic algorithms,genetic algorithm,ships,Genetic Algorithms,automatic identification system,inland water routes,Dutch provinces,logistics planning,Automatic Identification System,quad tree structure,Data Mining,directed graphs,pattern clustering,Artificial intelligence,route querying,maritime vessel destination prediction,Pattern Recognition,Logistics,Synchromodal Logistics,long term prediction,route waypoints,Boats,logistics data processing,Data mining,AIS data,arrival time prediction,data handling,"
"ais data visualization for maritime spatial planning (msp)","2016","The constant increase in marine traffic and the simultaneous growth of the demand for exploiting marine areas (e.g., installing offshore wind power plants) require an adequate planning strategy for managing high traffic volumes. Maritime Spatial Planning (MSP) is the process of public development of an allocation plan for distributing, both spatially and temporally, human activities in marine areas. The adoption of e-Navigation is a possible solution for improving safety and security at sea by integrating maritime information on board and ashore. Automatic Identification System (AIS) data represents a fundamental source of information, since the analysis of AIS data can highlight the presence of congested areas as well as of illegal actions, such as smuggling, pollution, and unauthorized phishing in protected areas. Indeed, those activities are often characterized by abnormal manoeuvres that can be recognized by analyzing the routes of the vessels. However, the huge dimension of the AIS data to process requires the adoption of careful strategies for the data visualization. In this paper, we present a complete pipeline for visualizing ship routes from raw AIS data, which is a fundamental pre-requisite for carrying out a significant AIS-based route analysis, and describe a real case study, where 90 million AIS records, corresponding to one month of world-wide observations, are visualized using only open-source software.","AIS data visualization,route analysis,intelligent transport systems,e-Navigation,AIS data,"
"building trust in online trade-in programs with a blockchain-enabled system","2022","Online trade-in programs provide efficient and convenient buyback services. However, they suffer from a trust deficit because of potential cheating by service providers (platforms). In this study, we design a blockchain-enabled system in which platforms tend to avoid cheating. The system employs an updated operation process to ensure reliable information inputs, a consortium blockchain network to avoid data tampering, and an intelligent algorithm embedded in a smart contract to automatically detect cheats. We then theoretically analyze the behavior of participants in the proposed system. In particular, we model the cheating decisions of a platform as chance-constrained programming and develop a Monte Carlo simulation method based on exploited optimality properties to solve it. Numerical experiments with real-world data demonstrate that the system reduces platforms’ motivation to cheat to an acceptable level. We draw managerial and policy implications to improve system performance.","Cheat detection,Trust,Closed-loop supply chain,Blockchain,Online trade-in,"
"obstacle avoidance and target search of an autonomous surface vehicle for 2016 maritime robotx challenge","2017","This paper describes algorithms for Autonomous Surface Vehicle(ASV) obstacle avoidance and target search task. This work is primarily designed for task mission of 2016 Maritime RobotX competition. In this task, ASV must avoid obstacle buoys, while it is searching for totem-shaped buoy. To deal with such problem, algorithms for both perception and motion planning stage was designed. In perception stage, 2D scanning LIDAR and monocular vision sensor are used to detect any floating objects on the water. To recognize target (totem buoy), HSV color space information was used. Detected object (both obstacle and totem buoy) information is tracked by using Kalman filter. In action planning stage, both deliberative and reflexive action [2] planning are designed. In deliberative action planning stage, based on the Kalman filter tracked obstacle information, a grid map can be generated. Using the grid map and A* search algorithm, desired path for searching totem can be calculated. In reflexive action planning stage, once ASV accidently enters hazardous region, where it has high probability of getting collide, it is designed to reflexively escape the region by making pure sway motion.

"characterization and sources of colored dissolved organic matter in a coral reef ecosystem subject to ultramafic erosion pressure (new caledonia, southwest pacific)","2018","The eastern lagoon of New Caledonia (NC, Southwest Pacific), listed as a UNESCO World Heritage site, hosts the world's second longest double-barrier coral reef. This lagoon receives river inputs, oceanic water arrivals, and erosion pressure from ultramafic rocks, enriched in nickel (Ni) and cobalt (Co). The aim of this study was to characterize colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM), as well as to determine its main sources and its possible relationships (through the use of Pearson correlation coefficients, r) with biogeochemical parameters, plankton communities and trace metals in the NC eastern lagoon. Water samples were collected in March 2016 along a series of river/lagoon/open-ocean transects. The absorption coefficient at 350nm (a350) revealed the influence of river inputs on the CDOM distribution. The high values of spectral slope (S275–295, >0.03m−1) and the low values of specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA254, <4Lmg-C−1m−1) highlighted the photodegradation of CDOM in surface waters. The application of parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) on excitation-emission matrices (EEMs) allowed the identification of four CDOM components: (1) one humic- and one tyrosine-like fluorophores. They had terrestrial origin, exported through rivers and undergoing photo- and bio-degradation in the lagoon. These two fluorophores were linked to manganese (Mn) in southern rivers (r=0.46–0.50, n=21, p<0.05). (2) A tryptophan-like fluorophore, which exhibited higher levels offshore. It would be potentially released from the coral reef. (3) A second tyrosine-like (“tyrosine 2-like”) fluorophore. Linked to Prochlorococcus cyanobacteria (r=0.39, n=47, p<0.05), this fluorophore would have an oceanic origin and enter in the lagoon through its southern and northern extremities. It also displayed relationships with Ni and Co content (r=0.53–0.54, n=21, p<0.05). This work underlines the diversity of CDOM sources in the NC eastern lagoon.","Southwest Pacific,CDOM,Coral reef lagoon,Rivers,Fluorescence,Trace metals,"
"the impact of climate change on the storm surges of the mediterranean sea: coastal sea level responses to deep depression atmospheric systems","2023","This study aims to systematically assess the impacts of projected climate change on episodic events of sea level elevation in coastal areas of the Mediterranean, induced by severe weather conditions identified as deep depressions. We try to add new insight in the long-term, climatic timescale, identification of affected parts of the Mediterranean coastal zone correlated to low atmospheric pressure systems, indicative of the Mediterranean basin during the 21st century. To achieve this goal, an integrated quantitative assessment is proposed by combining projections from available and established, green-house gasses emission/concentration scenarios (based on Representative Concentration Pathways; RCP 4.5 and 8.5) with advanced numerical modelling and statistical post-processing for the definition of cyclonic weather impacts on characteristic coastal zone hotspots. To this end, climate projections and outputs from three Regional Climate Models (RCMs) of the Med-CORDEX initiative at the Mediterranean basin scale are used and extensively evaluated against re-analysis data. These atmospheric datasets feed a robust storm surge model (MeCSS) for the simulation of barotropic hydrodynamics (sea level elevation and currents) thoroughly validated against in situ sea level observations by tide-gauges. Our results corroborate a projected storminess attenuation for the end of the 21st century, yet local differentiations in storm surge maxima around the Mediterranean coastal zone are pinpointed. Moreover, a slight reduction of average storm-induced Mean Sea Level (MSL; component attributed solely to the meteorological residual of sea level elevation) is also apparent towards the end of the 21st century. Extreme storm surge magnitudes range between 0.35 and 0.50 m in the Mediterranean with higher values along parts of its northern coasts (Venice lagoon, Gulf of Lions, northern Adriatic and Aegean Seas, etc.) and the Gulf of Gabes in its southern part. Overall, the spatial distributions of surge maxima are estimated to remain similar to those of the past throughout the entire Mediterranean coastal zone. Differentiations between the two scenarios (RCP4.5-8.5) used are obvious, not so much related to the spatiotemporal distribution of storm surge maxima, which shows a very stable pattern, but more in terms of their magnitudes. Indicatively, a decrease of surge maxima from -30% to -2% can be observed towards the end of the 21st century, especially for RCP8.5-driven MeCSS simulations. This is a spatially averaged estimation, yet for some specific coastal sites in Croatia, Spain Italy, and France, such as Rovinj, Bakar, Toulon, Trieste, Ajaccio, Genova, Marseilles, Naples, Venice, Cagliari, Ancona, Ibixa, and Barcelona, the storm surge maxima might increase from 1% to 22% under different RCM/RCP combinations towards the end of the 21st century. Our analysis leads to the quantification of deep depression systems’ effect on the coastal sea level elevation due to storm surges towards 2100. The strongest correlations of deep depression events to high sea levels are observed in several parts along the northern Mediterranean coasts (Gulfs of Valencia and Lions, Ligurian and northern Adriatic Seas). They are followed by mid-latitude areas around Corsica, Sardinia, the mid-zonal Italian Peninsula and the Adriatic, and the northern Aegean Sea. The influence of deep depressions on storm surges is lower for Sicily, South Italy, Peloponnese, Crete, the southern Aegean archipelago, and Alboran Sea. The only exceptions in the generally unaffected southern Mediterranean littorals are the Gulfs of Gabes and Alexandretta. These apply to the 20th century; however, they seem to repeat for the 21st century estimations, with even more pronounced differentiations between the southern and the northern parts. A projected northward shift of the main deep depression centres over the Mediterranean towards the end of the 21st century, is likely the reason for the latter. The climate change signal (difference of Future–Reference Period) of the deep cyclones’ effect on the episodic increases of coastal sea level seems to have a very clear pattern of slight attenuation in certain regions, i.e., Sardinia, Corsica, the Ligurian and Adriatic Seas, and the entire Italian peninsula for all RCM-fed implementations towards the end of the 21st century. Conditionally, this is the case for the Gulf of Valencia, the north-western African coasts, the Alboran, Ionian, Aegean, and Libyan Sea coasts, under specific combinations of RCM/RCP forcings. On the other hand, a possible increase of the Mediterranean deep depressions’ influence on the coastal storm surges might be the case for the Gulf of Lions, the Ionian, Aegean and Levantine Sea basins, covering the north-central and north-eastern coasts of Africa. In general, a positive influence of deep depressions to storm surge maxima would probably refer to areas of mid-to-high storm surge maxima (e.g., Aegean, Ionian, Gulf of Lions or Valencia or Gabes, etc.), but not the highest throughout the basin (e.g., Venice lagoon, Ligurian, Adriatic, etc.). In the latter coastal regions, however, intense local wind forcing mechanisms (i.e., Scirocco) are bound to play an essential role in the formation of high storm surges. The produced results can be used in focused studies for integrated hydrologic/hydrodynamic modelling under projected climate change conditions in the 21st century.","Mediterranean Sea,Deep depression,Sea surface height,Coastal zone,Representative Concentration Pathway,Inverse barometer effect,Storm surge,Climate change,Med-CORDEX,"
"ground-based and omi-tropomi no2 measurements at el arenosillo observatory: unexpected upward trends","2020","Eleven years, January 2008 to June 2019, of hourly nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels recorded at El Arenosillo observatory (Southwestern Europe) were analyzed. Annual averages ranged between 4 μg m−3 and 6 μg m−3 with peaks exceeding 40 μg m−3. A slight monthly variation was observed with maximum and minimum values in the cold (∼6 μg m−3) and warm (∼4 μg m−3) seasons respectively. A diurnal pattern was found with a weak amplitude (∼3 μg m−3). The monthly trends were investigated using surface observations and OMI (Ozone Monitoring instrument) satellite measurements. An unexpected upward trend was obtained in the last five years. The periods with elevated NO2 concentrations in the last years were analyzed, showing an increase in its frequency and concentrations, linked with the upward trend observed. The weather conditions in these NO2 peaks were studied using local surface meteorology, mean sea level pressure and wind fields from the data reanalysis of ERA5. The transport of NO2 was explored using TROPOMI (Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument) measurements. The events occurred under conditions governed by high-pressure systems, which induced weak synoptic airflows or the development of mesoscale processes. Four scenarios of NO2 transport were identified, associated with weak synoptic flows from inland or Southern Portugal and with mesoscale processes. The gulf of Cadiz plays an important role as a reservoir where the NO2 coming from the south of Portugal, the Western Mediterranean Basin and urban-industrial areas can be accumulated and later transported inland. A strong correlation was found between the increase of NO2 observed in the last years and positive anomalies of the temperature and geopotential height at 850 and 500 hPa levels. These findings could indicate that the causes of the changes in the NO2 would be attributed to alterations in the weather patterns associated with a warmer climate.","NO trends,Nitrogen oxides,OMI instrument,ECMWF-ERA5,TROPOMI instrument,"
"spatial and temporal variability of sea ice in the laptev sea: analyses and review of satellite passive-microwave data and model results, 1979 to 2002","2005","Satellite passive-microwave radiometer-derived sea-ice concentrations have been used to investigate the spatial and temporal variability and trends of sea ice in the Laptev Sea during 24 years from 1979 through 2002. The resulting time series have been further analyzed to provide a climatology for sea-ice and polynya characteristics. The ice regime of the Laptev Sea is characterized by a large seasonal and interannual variability, the latter occurring exclusively in summer. By using a consistent sea-ice data record, we can document negative trends in all the areas studied for the 24-year period, Due to the large interannual variability the trends are not significant. For the entire Laptev Sea the decreases in sea-ice extent and area on a yearly average basis reveal −1.5% decade−1 and −1.7% decade−1, respectively. In summer and early fall large losses in sea-ice cover of up to 7% decade−1 are evident in regional sectors of the Laptev Sea. In addition, an increase in polynya activity in late winter and early spring, a significant shift towards earlier snowmelt onset, and an increase of open-water area in early fall indicating an extension of the length of the summer melt period, has been observed. A brief overview of climate and sea-ice research in the Siberian Arctic is presented. According to observational data and numerical experiments there is still a large degree of uncertainty about the role of dynamic and thermodynamic factors and possible feedback mechanisms in the atmosphere–ice–ocean system, which are responsible for the large interannual variability and the retreat of sea-ice coverage as observed in the 1990s. Summer sea-ice anomalies likely result from synoptic-scale processes superimposed by the large-scale atmospheric circulation during summer and to a lesser extent from preconditioning processes in winter and spring.","thermodynamic sea-ice model,remote sensing,polynyas,cyclone detection and tracking,sea ice,Laptev Sea,Arctic,"
"an adaptive ionosphere clutter suppression and target detection method for hfswr maritime surveillance","2023","High-frequency surface wave radar (HFSWR) as a maritime surveillance facility faces the tough challenges. One of them is that various unwanted echo components constantly destroy the detection performance of HFSWR, especially the dynamically changing ionosphere clutter. This article proposes an adaptive ionosphere clutter suppression and target detection algorithm (AICSTD) based on improved higher order singular value decomposition (HOSVD) and deep learning network. First, we analyze the multiple-dimensional characteristics of different types of ionosphere clutter echo data. Then, refer to the multichannel HFSWR echo data structure, we apply simplified HOSVD and orthogonal subspace projection to eliminate the unwanted echo component and, meanwhile, preserve the target echo. The key parameter of simplified HOSVD is determined by the mean structural similarity (MSSIM) index, which contributes to reduce the computation complexity of the proposed method. Finally, we improved the deep learning network to detect the targets in various behaviors after the clutter suppression. In order to address the issue of limited clutter data, transfer learning based on historical radar echo data is applied. A thorough experimental analysis on various real clutter data shows that the proposed method performs competitively. Our method shows a superior performance over many state-of-the-art clutter suppression methods, with a covered target detection accuracy of 92.4% under strong spread clutter background.","Ionosphere,structural similarity (SSIM) index,higher order singular value decomposition (HOSVD),ionosphere clutter suppression,Tensors,Clutter,Deep learning,Object detection,Doppler effect,target detection,high-frequency surface wave radar (HFSWR),Reflection,"

The framework consists of maritime traffic pattern recognition, semantic routes extraction, route decomposition, and network generation. Firstly, a data-driven method is introduced to recognize ship behavior patterns and extends the single ship behaviors to regional characteristics to determine the departure-arrival areas. Then, based on the different combination of departure-arrival areas, the ship trajectories are classified to traffic groups. Subsequently, the grid-system is used to rasterize each traffic group, which realizes the fusion of trajectory data and geographic location information. Finally, to obtain the main routes and navigation channels, the extraction method is introduced by establishing the cumulative grid importance function. The main routes, together with the navigation channels, compose the maritime traffic network. The method is applied to AIS data in the Beibu Gulf, and the results show that the traffic network contains 12 stop areas, 4 entry/exit locations, 13 main routes as well as their corresponding navigation channels. It is therefore concluded that the proposed method helps (1) provide a theoretical framework to obtain and analyze the maritime traffic network and (2) enrich navigation channel identification methods for maritime transport management.","Maritime traffic network,Maritime transport management,AIS,Machine learning,Big data analytics,"
"systematic analysis of human factors in maritime transportation","2023","65.8% of marine casualties and incidents are attributed to human actions, according to European Maritime Safety Agency. It is even more worrisome given the emerging Maritime Autonomous Surface Ships (MASS) in which human factors play an increasingly important role (e.g. remote controlled vessels). Therefore, it triggers a new research question on how to effectively address human factors in the next generation of maritime transport given more complicated traffic and increased automation. One of realistic solutions is to develop a systematic and holistic methodology, capable of conducting human factor analysis under various circumstances depending on crucial influencing factors such as the nature of human behaviors (physical or psychological) and features of the available data (uncertainty level). This study pioneers this development with a new framework for the quantitative analysis of human factors in maritime transport. It first explores the common risk factors, data collection resources, and quantitative analysis methodologies in the literature. With regard to different research objectives, bespoke approaches aiming at specific purposes, i.e., risk-based accident analysis, neurophysiological analysis during navigation, and human reliability performance evaluation for a particular task, are integrated to develop the systematic analysis framework holistically. Compared to piecemeal classical methods, the results show the feasibility and beauty of systematically utilizing assembled methods in different situations and how the new methodology can better fit the increasing demand for human reliability in the maritime transport era involving MASS. The proposed framework can provide a transparent tool to quantify and evaluate human factors for a specific purpose, particularly a hybrid of both physical and psychological concerns. It also generates insights into the whole development process of MASS, from its low to high degrees of autonomation.","Transportation,human errors,Safety,human factor analysis,human behaviors,transportation,maritime autonomous surface ships,Human factors,human factors,psychology,quantitative analysis methodologies,systematic analysis framework,ships,common risk factors,Performance evaluation,maritime transportation,maritime transport,European Maritime Safety Agency,human actions,Statistical analysis,MASS,Psychology,human reliability performance evaluation,maritime transport era,Systematics,maritime safety,"
"the wet and dry spells within the mjo-phase 8 and the role of enso and iod on the modulation of these spells: a regional to continental-scales analysis","2023","To improve our understanding of the reasons behind the wet or dry spells within a phase of the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO), we separated the dates of the spells with pervasive precipitation (SWPP) from the spells with widespread dryness (SWWD) during phase 8. Although Iran's southwest precipitation data were used to extract these dates, we showed that the SWPP or SWWD is associated with large-scale climate variability. After proving that the MJO indices are insufficient to explain differences between SWPP and SWWD, we introduced several non-MJO indexes to explain these differences. Among the proposed indicators, two quasi-oscillations of the sea surface temperature and air pressure systems were more significant. These oscillations operate between the west and east of the Arabian Sea and between the Arabian sea and Mediterranean Sea.The study explained why compared to La Niña, El Niño enhances (suppresses) precipitation in western and northern (eastern and southern) Iran and the Arabian Peninsula. We showed that during all subsets of phase 8 including –IOD, a dipole mode of convective activities similar to that expected for +IOD dominates the Indian Ocean. Conversely, the climate systems over the tropical East Atlantic Ocean and West Africa are generally opposite between –IOD and + IOD. We justified how the interaction between climate systems in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans shortens (elongates) phase 8's lifetime during +IOD (-IOD). Ultimately, the study specified the areas of the Middle East, India, and Central Asian Countries where precipitation is significantly different between the +IOD and –IOD parts of phase 8.","Iran,IOD,Arabian Peninsula,ENSO,MJO,SST,India,precipitation,Middle East,"
"performance analysis of vca-based target detection system for maritime surveillance","2023","In the latest years great importance and research efforts have been put into safety and security aspects concerning the vehicular framework. In this connection, maritime surveillance is playing an important role, since situation awareness proves fundamental to ensure safety conditions at sea. In this work, we propose a novel maritime surveillance system based on Video Content Analysis, where vessel detection is performed automatically by a remote Machine Learning based target identification algorithm.

"continuous monitoring of land disturbance based on landsat time series","2020","We developed a new algorithm for COntinuous monitoring of Land Disturbance (COLD) using Landsat time series. COLD can detect many kinds of land disturbance continuously as new images are collected and provide historical land disturbance maps retrospectively. To better detect land disturbance, we tested different kinds of input data and explored many time series analysis techniques. We have several major observations as follows. First, time series of surface reflectance provides much better detection results than time series of Top-Of-Atmosphere (TOA) reflectance, and with some adjustments to the temporal density, time series from Landsat Analysis Ready Data (ARD) is better than it is from the same Landsat scene. Second, the combined use of spectral bands is always better than using a single spectral band or index, and if all the essential spectral bands have been employed, the inclusion of other indices does not further improve the algorithm performance. Third, the remaining outliers in the time series can be removed based on their deviation from model predicted values based on probability-based thresholds derived from normal or chi-squared distributions. Fourth, model initialization is pivotal for monitoring land disturbance, and a good initialization stability test can influence algorithm performance substantially. Fifth, time series model estimation with eight coefficients model, updated for every single observation, based on all available clear observations achieves the best result. Sixth, a change probability of 0.99 (chi-squared distribution) with six consecutive anomaly observations and a mean included angle < 45° to confirm a change provide the best results, and the combined use of temporally-adjusted Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and minimum RMSE is recommended. Finally, spectral changes (or “breaks”) contributed from vegetation regrowth should be excluded from land disturbance maps. The COLD algorithm was developed and calibrated based on all these lessons learned above. The accuracy assessment shows that COLD results were accurate for detecting land disturbance, with an omission error of 27% and a commission error of 28%.","Landsat,Time series,COLD,Change detection,Near real-time,Land disturbance,"
"operational active fire mapping and burnt area identification applicable to mexican nature protection areas using modis and noaa-avhrr direct readout data","2009","Since 1999, the National Commission for the Knowledge and Use of the Biodiversity (CONABIO) in Mexico has been developing and managing the “Operational program for the detection of hot-spots using remote sensing techniques”. This program uses images from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard the Terra and Aqua satellites and from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA-AVHRR), which are operationally received through the Direct Readout station (DR) at CONABIO. This allows the near-real time monitoring of fire events in Mexico and Central America. In addition to the detection of active fires, the location of hot spots are classified with respect to vegetation types, accessibility, and risk to Nature Protection Areas (NPA). Besides the fast detection of fires, further analysis is necessary due to the considerable effects of forest fires on biodiversity and human life. This fire impact assessment is crucial to support the needs of resource managers and policy makers for adequate fire recovery and restoration actions. CONABIO attempts to meet these requirements, providing post-fire assessment products as part of the management system in particular for satellite-based burnt area mapping. This paper provides an overview of the main components of the operational system and will present an outlook to future activities and system improvements, especially the development of a burnt area product. A special focus will also be placed on the fire occurrence within NPAs of Mexico.","Direct readout,Active fire mapping,Burnt area,NOAA-AVHRR,Mexico,Nature protection area,MODIS,"
"segmentation and classification of man-made maritime objects in terrasar-x images","2011","Spaceborne monitoring of wide maritime areas can be suit able for many applications such as tracking of ship traffic, surveillance of fishery zones, or detecting criminal activities. We present novel approaches for segmentation and classification of man-made objects in TerraSAR-X images including estimation of orientation and size. This is a difficult task as detections are affected by clutter and noise effects, and each object can have different appearances. We chose a statistical approach to robustly segment given detections using Local Binary Pattern (LBP) and Histograms of Oriented Gradients (HOG). This is the fundament for subsequent feature analysis and 3-stage-classification based on Support Vector Machines (SVM) with separation of clutter and man-made objects in first, non-ships and ships in second, and different ship structure types in third stage.

"variability and propagation of labrador sea water in the southern subpolar north atlantic","2009","The variability of two modes of Labrador Sea Water (LSW) (upper and deep Labrador Sea Water) and their respective spreading in the interior North Atlantic Ocean are investigated by means of repeated ship surveys carried out along the zonal WOCE line A2/AR19 located at 43–48°N (1993–2007) and along the GOOS line at about 48–51°N (1997–2002). Hydrographic section data are complemented by temperature, salinity, and velocity time series recorded by two moorings. They have been deployed at the western flank of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR) in the Newfoundland Basin during 1996–2004. The analysis of hydrographic anomalies at various longitudes points to a gradual eastward propagation of LSW-related signals, which happens on time scales of 3–6 years from the formation region towards the MAR. Interactions of the North Atlantic Current (NAC) with the Deep Western Boundary Current (DWBC) close to Flemish Cap point to the NAC being the main distributor of the different types of LSW into the interior of the Newfoundland Basin. Comparisons between the ship data and the mooring records revealed that the mooring sites are located in a region affected by highly variable flow. The mooring time series demonstrate an elevated level of variability with eddy activity and variability associated with the NAC considerably influencing the LSW signals in this region. Hydrographic data taken from Argo profiles from the vicinity of the mooring sites turned out to mimic quite well the temporal evolution captured by the moorings. There is some indication of occasional southward flow in the LSW layer near the MAR. If this can be considered as a hint to an interior LSW-route, it is at least of minor importance in comparison to the DWBC. It acts as an important supplier for the interior North Atlantic, distributing older and recently formed LSW modes southward along the MAR.","Water mass spreading,Subpolar North Atlantic,Mid-Atlantic Ridge,Ocean circulation,Labrador Sea Water,"

"a modeling study of the impact of the 2007 greek forest fires on the gaseous pollutant levels in the eastern mediterranean","2014","The main objective of the present study is the assessment of the non-radiative impact on the lower troposphere air quality of the intense biomass burning events that took place in the Eastern Mediterranean, when wild forest fires were burning in Peloponnesus (Greece) at the end of August 2007. The MM5-CAMx modeling system was applied in the Eastern Mediterranean in high spatial and temporal resolution for the period 23 to 31 August 2007, forced by biomass burning emission fluxes from the Global Fire Emissions Database (version 3.0), in day-to-day temporal and 0.1° spatial variability from the Global Fire Assimilation System. Enhancements of the CO and NOx concentrations over almost the entire modeling domain were estimated due to the biomass burning, which were more pronounced over the burnt areas and maximum over the Peloponnesus forest fires. The domain-wide near surface mean concentration was higher by +6% for CO and +11% for NOx because of the biomass burning. The near surface O3 values were reduced over the fire hot spots but increased over the greater part of the modeling domain. On the 26th August 2007, the maximum O3 concentrations reduction of about 12ppb (i.e. −34%) was calculated over the Peloponnesus fires while the highest O3 increase of about 27ppb (i.e. +52%) was estimated over the sea at 500km downwind the Peloponnesus large forest fires. The process analysis revealed that on that day, the inclusion of the biomass burning emissions resulted in an enhancement of the daytime gas phase O3 production in the boundary layer in the Eastern Mediterranean and during some daytime hours in a change of the chemical regime from O3 destruction to O3 production. From 6 to 16 UTC, the O3 photochemistry in the boundary layer was VOC-sensitive close to the Peloponnesus fires, gradually changing to NOx-sensitive in the downwind fire plume. In the same period, the maximum impact on the oxidizing capacity of the boundary layer was an increase by 0.25ppt for OH and a reduction by 13ppt for HO2 mean concentrations over the Peloponnesus forest fires and an increase by 12ppt for HO2 in the downwind plume.","Forest fires,Air quality,Process analysis,Eastern Mediterranean,"
"performance modeling of data transmission in maritime delay-tolerant-networks","2013","In maritime networks, the communication links are characterized by high dynamics due to ship mobility and fluctuation of the sea surface. Some researchers have considered using Delay Tolerant Network (DTN) to improve the performance of data transmission in maritime environment. Most existing work on maritime DTNs usually uses simulation to evaluate the transmission performance in maritime DTNs. In this paper, we develop a theoretical model to analyze the performance of data transmission in maritime DTNs. We first construct a model to describe the ship encounter probability. Then, we use this model to analyze the data delivery ratio from ships in the seaway to the base station (BS) at coast. Based on the data of tracing the ships navigating in a realistic seaway, we develop a simulator and validate the theoretical models. In addition, by comparing the performance of DTN transmission protocol and traditional end-to-end transmission protocol, we validate that DTN protocol can effectively improve the performance of data transmission in maritime networks.","Data communication,performance modeling,data transmission,sea surface,base station,Marine vehicles,maritime delay-tolerant-networks,end-to-end transmission protocol,data delivery ratio,ship mobility,ships,Data models,Probability distribution,Data Delivery Ratio,communication links,Performance Modeling,Maritime Network,delay tolerant networks,probability,marine communication,DTN,Protocols,Navigation,Analytical models,"

"recognition of maritime objects based on flir images using the method of eigenimages","2018","The paper presents the method of recognition of marine objects based on their images taken by infrared sensors (FLIR - forward looking infrared) using the method of eigenimages analysis. This method is based on the principal component analysis (PCA) method that allows to reduce the dimensionality of the problem of image recognition. The paper presents a method of maritime objects recognition based on FLIR images consisting of the following stages: pre-processing of images from the pattern database, calculation of coordinates of images from the pattern database in a new reduced feature space, calculation of coordinates of image cluster centers, pre-processing of a new image, calculation of coordinates of a new image in the reduced feature space, calculation of the distances of the recognized image from all the image cluster centers in the pattern database and making a decision on choosing the most similar maritime object, or stating that there is no image satisfying the similarity condition in the pattern database. The combination of the principal component analysis (PCA) method with the method of eigenimages analysis reduces the dimensionality of the recognition problem. The original dimension is equal to the number of pixels in each image. It must be equal for all the images from pattern database and the image being recognized. The final value of the problem dimension is equal to the number of image clusters in the pattern database. In some situations, the dimensionality of the problem can be reduced due to the low eigenvalues of the matrix of Karhunen-Loeve transformation.

"modeling risk in the dynamic environment of maritime transportation","2001","The Washington State Ferries are one of the largest ferry systems in the world. Accidents involving Washington State Ferries are rare events. However, low probability, high consequence events lead to difficulties in the risk assessment process. Due to the infrequent occurrence of such accidents, large accident databases are not available for a standard statistical analysis of the contribution of perceived risk factors to accident risk. In the WSF Risk Assessment, a modeling approach that combined system simulation, expert judgement and available data was used to estimate the contribution of risk factors to accident risk. Simulation is necessary to capture the dynamic environment of changing risk factors, such as traffic interactions, visibility or wind conditions, and to evaluate future scenarios that are designed to alter this dynamic behavior for the purposes of risk reduction or improved passenger service.

"application of estuarine and coastal classifications in marine spatial management","2023","Coastal and marine classifications, both spatially explicit in the form of maps and non-spatial representations of the environment, are critical to the effective implementation of ecosystem-based management strategies such as marine spatial planning. This chapter provides an overview of a wide range of coastal classifications and classified maps developed to simplify and communicate biological, physical, social, and economic patterns in support of enhanced management decision making. Examples are provided from around the world and span a range of spatial scales from global coastal classifications to those for individual bays and estuaries. Technological advances in remote sensing, social-media analyses and artificial intelligence classifiers have diversified and improved the performance and application of biophysical coastal classifications and thematic maps. In the past decade, important progress has been made in the spatial representation of cultural values through participatory mapping and the integration of social-ecological patterns for coastal risk assessment. Mapping ecosystem services has become more widespread and the desire for environmental sustainability across sectors has seen a proliferation in predictive mapping applied to conservation prioritization and marine spatial planning. The chapter offers a showcase rather than a critique of applications and concludes with a section highlighting progress and future challenges in developing more culturally meaningful coastal classifications to inform coastal management.","Conservation prioritization,Ecosystem services,Change analysis,Marine spatial planning,Habitat mapping,Marine protected areas,Classification,Ecosystem-based approach,Culture,"

"mesoscale modeling of smoke transport over the southeast asian maritime continent: interplay of sea breeze, trade wind, typhoon, and topography","2013","The online-coupled Weather Research and Forecasting model with Chemistry (WRFchem) is used to simulate the transport of smoke particles over the Southeast Asian Maritime Continent during September–October 2006. In this period, dry conditions associated with the moderate El Niño event caused the largest regional biomass burning outbreak since 1997. Smoke emission in WRFchem is specified according to the Fire Locating and Modeling of Burning Emissions (FLAMBE) database derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) fire products. The modeled smoke transport pathway is found to be consistent with the MODIS true color images and measured mass concentration of surface PM10 (particulate matter with diameter less than 10μm). The interplay of sea/land breezes, typhoons and storms over the subtropical western Pacific Ocean, trade winds, and topographic effects, can be clearly seen in the model simulation. The most severe smoke events in 1–5 October 2006 are found to be associated with the meteorological responses to the typhoon Xangsane (#18) over the western subtropical Pacific Ocean, which moved smoke from Sumatra eastward in the lower troposphere (below 700hPa), forming smoke layers mixed with and above the boundary layer clouds over Borneo. In contrast, the second largest week-long smoke transport event of 15–18 October 2006 was associated with the seasonal monsoonal transition period, during which smoke plumes were wide spread over the 5°S–5°N zone as a result of (a) the near surface divergence coupled with the 700hPa bifurcation of wind (flowing both to the west and to the east), and (b) the near-surface southeasterly and easterly winds along the equator transporting smoke from Borneo to Sumatra and Peninsular Malaysia. Analysis of data from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarisation (CALIOP) shows that smoke particles in October 2006 were primarily located within 3.5km above the surface. Smoke particles contributed roughly half of the total aerosol extinction retrieved by CALIOP. Results suggest that the smoke injection height in the model should be set lower than the 2–5km commonly used in transport simulations; smoke release at ~0.8km instead of 2km above surface gives a consistently better match to CALIOP observations. Numerical experiments further show that the Titiwangsa Mountains in Malaysia Peninsula and Tama Abu Mountains in Borneo have significant impacts on smoke transport and the surface air quality in the vicinity.","Sea breeze,Trade wind,Typhoon,Southeast Asian Maritime Continent,Smoke particles,"
"reconstruction of mining activities in the western alps during the past 2500 years from natural archives","2021","The geochemical analysis of natural archives can improve our knowledge of past mining activities and their environmental imprint. The sedimentary records from the Hasli-Aare floodplain (Bernese Alps) over the last 2500 years were analysed for metals. Evidence of past mining contamination was obtained from the XRF analyses of iron, copper, zinc and lead. These results were analytically and statistically processed to produce a metal content index. Positive metal anomalies indicate four major pulses of contamination coinciding with the end of the Iron Age, from the end of the Roman Period to the Early Medieval Period, the Late Medieval Period, and the Modern Period. These pulses show good agreement with local historical sources of mining in the Hasli-Aare catchment, dating back to the beginning of the 15th century. Furthermore, they are in phase with anthropogenic pollution trends inferred from glacier ice cores, lake sediments and peat bogs across the Western Alps, most notably during the Roman, Late Medieval and Modern Periods. However, close comparison between these records can show some differences, suggesting local variations in mining activities and/or a lag in metal transfer. The reconstructed periods of anthropogenic metal pollution are located in their political, economic and social contexts and compared with the climate periods of central Europe.","Metal content,Western Alps,Late Holocene,Geochemistry,Historical mining,Floodplain sediments,"
"circulation patterns, wildfire risk and wildfire occurrence at continental spain","2010","Daily weather variability is a major factor affecting the behaviour of wildfires. This paper analyzes the links between atmospheric circulation at synoptic scale, weather conditions influencing fires at regional scale and the occurrence of very large forest fires in continental. A synoptic climatology of the 850hPa geopotential heights was derived employing multivariate techniques (Principal Component Analysis and Clustering). The catalogue displays the spatial and temporal variability of the atmospheric circulation over the area, reproducing distinctive pressure patterns and seasonal frequency variations. Each pattern shows substantial region-wide differences in the magnitude of weather-related fire risk conditions, corresponding to combinations of controlling climatic factors. Finally, the results emphasise the obligation to combine both short term and long term climate variability to explain the occurrence of episodes of very large wildfires.","Iberian Peninsula,Weather-related wildfire risk,Synoptic climatology,Very large wildfires,"

"systems evaluation for defense operations of maritime transport","2020","Mobility of personnel and cargo, such as maritime transport, is subject to safety and security risks within a system corridor. Maritime transport has a critical role in the global economy but is subject to intentional attacks and site-specific risks. Decision-makers are informed by quantitative and qualitive factors in the prioritization of corridor risks through multi-objective criteria analysis. Previously, corridor analysis has been accomplished with innovative straight-line diagrams for land transportation but can be extended to evaluate disorganized corridors such as waterways. Attacks can originate from aerial, submerged, and surface origins with unique security risks associated with waterway channel geometry.

"automatic self-reconstruction model for radio map in wi-fi fingerprinting","2022","The Wi-Fi fingerprinting is applied to the indoor positioning system (IPS) based on the radio map, which is the established received signal strength indication (RSSI) fingerprint database. However, since static radio maps built offline are vulnerable to environmental dynamics, interruptions occur in the online phase. To solve this problem, in this paper, we propose an Automatic Self-Reconstruction (ASR) model that combines Radio Encoding-based Deep Fingerprint Positioning (RE-DFP) and Radio Anomaly Detecting (RAD), which enables seamless positioning of Wi-Fi fingerprinting. The proposed model consists of an encoder-decoder-based RE-DFP network to improve positioning accuracy and data efficiency and a RAD network to analyze environmental dynamics according to APs. In the proposed RE-DFP, a CNN-based encoder is applied to increase efficiency by minimizing the dependence of the radio map, and the position is estimated through an LSTM-based decoder. RAD identifies the AP, which is the cause of the change in the radio map and excludes it from the online phase, preventing a decrease in positioning accuracy. Simultaneously, the proposed model collects the RSSI of the identified AP through crowdsourcing and reconstructs the radio map by itself, enabling a seamless positioning service in the online phase.","Radio map,RE-DFP,Indoor positioning system,Fingerprinting,RAD,"
"the wedge clam (donax trunculus) hand-operated fishery in the nw mediterranean sea: landings, catch composition, damage rates and impact of fishing activity","2023","The bivalve wedge clam Donax trunculus is a highly valued species in Spain, but wild stocks have decreased in the Mediterranean region in recent decades. Internal demand exceeds the existing supply derived from local production. Hand-operated dredge fishery is still important in some coastal areas of Spain, such as the Ebro Delta (NE Spain). However, scientific information is lacking on most aspects of this fishery which is essential for its sustainable management. In this context, this study aimed to provide the first characterization of the hand-operated dredges fishery; evaluate the damage of this fishery on the megabenthic fauna; and analyze the impact of the fishing activity on the wedge clam. Our results indicate that landings declined dramatically since the mid-1990s and the main causes for this decline are postulated. Fishing effort was highly seasonal, being more intense from March to September. The discard fraction was very small (5.74% in abundance and the 3.74% in biomass) and 61.93% of the discards did not suffer damage. Clam fishing activity had an impact on recruit density in the short term (3 months), but not on recruit size and commercial fraction density, biomass and size. Our results provide tools for a better management of this type of fisheries.","Small-scale fisheries,Wedge clam,Clam fisheries,Management,"
"high resolution isar imaging for maritime targets by encoder-decoder network combined with the time-frequency attention","2021","The Inverse Synthetic Aperture Radar (ISAR) imaging result of a rotating maritime target is usually defoculsing since the complex sea conditions may cause time-varying spin speed of targets. A common solution is to utilize range instantaneous Doppler (RID) algorithm for short time imaging, however, the RID algorithm suffers from the low time-frequency resolution. Therefore, this paper proposes an Encoder-Decoder neural net-work combined with Time-Frequency Attention (TFA) module to enhance instantaneous frequency resolution. The TFA module is utilized to extract the spectral lines of weak scatterers, further, the Encoder-Decoder network is designed to transform the low-resolution time-frequency refined by the TFA module to their high-resolution counterparts. Finally, the performance of the proposed method is evaluated on the simulated and real measured data.

"a history of vegetation, sediment and nutrient dynamics at tivoli north bay, hudson estuary, new york","2012","We conduct a stratigraphic paleoecological investigation at a Hudson River National Estuarine Research Reserve (HRNERR) site, Tivoli Bays, spanning the past 1100 years. Marsh sediment cores were analyzed for ecosystem changes using multiple proxies, including pollen, spores, macrofossils, charcoal, sediment bulk chemistry, and stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes. The results reveal climatic shifts such as the warm and dry Medieval Warm Period (MWP) followed by the cooler Little Ice Age (LIA), along with significant anthropogenic influence on the watershed ecosystem. A five-fold expansion of invasive species, including Typha angustifolia and Phragmites australis, is documented along with marked changes in sediment composition and nutrient input. During the last century, a ten-fold sedimentation rate increase due to land-use changes is observed. The large magnitude of shifts in vegetation, sedimentation, and nutrients during the last few centuries suggest that human activities have made the greatest impact to the marshes of the Hudson Estuary during the last millennium. Climate variability and ecosystem changes similar to those observed at other marshes in northeastern and mid-Atlantic estuaries, attest to the widespread regional signature recorded at Tivoli Bays.","nitrogen cycle,tidal marshes,invasive species,New York,Little Ice Age,Medieval Warm period,paleoecology,stable isotopes,climate change,European settlement,palynology,"
"uncertainty fusion based object recognition and tracking in maritime scenes using spatiotemporal active contours","2014","This article addresses the problem of near real time video analysis of a maritime scene using a (moving) airborne RGB video camera in the goal of detecting and eventually recognizing a target maritime vessel. This is a very challenging problem mainly due to the high level of uncertainty of a maritime scene including a dynamic and noisy background, camera's and target's motions, and broad variability of background's versus target's appearances. We propose an approach which attempts to combine several types of spatiotemporal uncertainty in a single probabilistic framework. This allows to achieve a likelihood ratio with respect to any possible spatiotemporal configuration of the 2D+T video volume. Using the MAP estimation criterion, such a problem can be recast as as an energy minimization problem that we solve efficiently using a spatiotemporal active contour approach. We demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach using real maritime videos.","Streaming media,Trajectory,Spatiotemporal Active Contours,Airborne Video System,Dynamic Texture Uncertainty,Image color analysis,Uncertainty,Spatiotemporal phenomena,Dynamic Background,Chromatic Uncertainty,Energy Minimization,Cameras,Mathematical model,Maritime Surveillance,Vessel Recognition,MAP Estimation,"
"design of provably secure authentication protocol for edge-centric maritime transportation system","2023","The epidemic growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) objects have revolutionized Maritime Transportation Systems (MTS). Though, it becomes challenging for the centralized cloud-centric framework to fulfil the application requirements such as low latency and power utilization. The introduction of the distributed edge-centric framework has recently helped the IoT-enabled MTS to meet these requirements by manipulating the tasks at the edge of the networks. Despite the fact that MTS leverages mobile subscribers by overcoming inherent cloud computing limitations, data security and user privacy requirements in establishing the MTS setup are still non-trivial challenges. In this article, we develop a key agreement solution for mobile users to realize mutual authentication in a single round. Our protocol offers user anonymity to maintain user privacy, and it can prevent physical attacks by physically unclonable functions. Initially, the security analysis is conferred to substantiate our protocolâ€™s security persistence or strength. Later, its performance correlation is observed under the assumption of diverse metrics in a predefined empirical setup. The meticulous performance correlation endorses the precedence of our protocol over specified related protocols.","authentication protocol,Hash functions,mobile edge computing,Servers,authentication,Cloud computing,Protocols,Authentication,Internet of Things,Security,Mutual authentication,"
"application of synthetic weather time series based on four-dimensional copula for modeling of maritime operations","2021","This paper presents an approach to generate synthetic wind speed and wave height series for maritime environments with a four-dimensional copula using the Copulas Python library.

The paper shows that this approach corrects a wave series discontinuity issue that was observed in an approach that was developed for a similar purpose.

"a collaborative cyber incident management system for european interconnected critical infrastructures","2017","Today's Industrial Control Systems (ICSs) operating in critical infrastructures (CIs) are becoming increasingly complex; moreover, they are extensively interconnected with corporate information systems for cost-efficient monitoring, management and maintenance. This exposes ICSs to modern advanced cyber threats. Existing security solutions try to prevent, detect, and react to cyber threats by employing security measures that typically do not cross the organization's boundaries. However, novel targeted multi-stage attacks such as Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) take advantage of the interdependency between organizations. By exploiting vulnerabilities of various systems, APT campaigns intrude several organizations using them as stepping stones to reach the target infrastructure. A coordinated effort to timely reveal such attacks, and promptly deploy mitigation measures is therefore required. Organizations need to cooperatively exchange security-relevant information to obtain a broader knowledge on the current cyber threat landscape and subsequently obtain new insight into their infrastructures and timely react if necessary. Cyber security operation centers (SOCs), as proposed by the European NIS directive, are being established worldwide to achieve this goal. CI providers are asked to report to the responsible SOCs about security issues revealed in their networks. National SOCs correlate all the gathered data, analyze it and eventually provide support and mitigation strategies to the affiliated organizations. Although many of these tasks can be automated, human involvement is still necessary to enable SOCs to adequately take decisions on occurring incidents and quickly implement counteractions. In this paper we present a collaborative approach to cyber incident information management for gaining situational awareness on interconnected European CIs. We provide a scenario and an illustrative use-case for our approach; we propose a system architecture for a National SOC, defining the functional components and interfaces it comprises. We further describe the functionalities provided by the different system components to support SOC operators in performing incident management tasks.","Cyber incident reporting,Cyber security,Information sharing,Cyber incident handling,Security operation center,"
"monitoring recent changes of vegetation in fildes peninsula (king george island, antarctica) through satellite imagery guided by uav surveys","2020","Mapping accurately vegetation surfaces in space and time in the ice-free areas of Antarctica can provide important information to quantitatively describe the evolution of their ecosystems. Spaceborne remote sensing is the adequate way to map and evaluate multitemporal changes on the Antarctic vegetation at large but its nature of occurrence, in relatively small and sparse patches, makes the identification very challenging. The inclusion of an intermediate scale of observation between ground and satellite scales, provided by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) imagery, is of great help not only for their effective classification, but also for discriminating their main communities (lichens and mosses). Thus, this paper quantifies accurately recent changes of the vegetated areas in Fildes Peninsula (King George Island, Antarctica) through a novel methodology based on the integration of multiplatform data (satellite and UAV). It consists of multiscale imagery (spatial resolution of 2 m and 2 cm) from the same period to create a robust classifier that, after intensive calibration, is adequately used in other dates, where field reference data is scarce or not available at all. The methodology is developed and tested with UAV and satellite data from 2017 showing overall accuracies of 96% and kappa equal to 0.94 with a SVM classifier. These high performances allow the extrapolation to a pair of previous dates, 2006 and 2013, when atmospherically clear very high-resolution satellite imagery are available. The classification allows verifying a loss of the total area of vegetation of 4.5% during the 11-year time period under analysis, which corresponds to a 10.3% reduction for Usnea sp. and 9.8% for moss formations. Nevertheless, the breakdown analysis by time period shows a distinct behaviour for each vegetation type which are evaluated and discussed, namely for Usnea sp. whose decline is likely to be related to changing snow conditions.","Vegetation Mapping,Object-based classification,Change detection,Satellite,Permafrost,Antarctica,UAV,"

"estimation of the contributions of the sources driving pm2.5 levels in a central mediterranean coastal town","2018","Receptor modelling techniques are widely used in order to identify the main natural and anthropogenic processes driving aerosol levels at a receptor. In this work, Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) was used to apportion PM2.5 levels at a traffic site (Msida) located in a coastal town. 180 filters collected throughout a yearly sampling campaign conducted in 2016, were chemically characterized by light absorbance analysis, x-ray fluorescence and ion chromatography in order to determine the concentrations of black carbon, 17 elements and 5 ions, respectively. The resulting chemical data base was used in conjunction with PMF in order to identify the 7 components affecting the PM2.5 levels at the receptor site. Six of these sources are considered to be typical of the atmospheric composition of coastal traffic sites: traffic (27.3%), ammonium sulfate (23.6%), Saharan dust (15%), aged sea salt (12.7%), shipping (5%) and fresh sea salt (4.6%). This is the first time that such a study was carried out in Malta and helps in understanding the aerosol pollution climate of the Central Mediterranean, which is still relatively understudied when compared to the Eastern and Western Mediterranean. Furthermore, we have isolated a factor exclusive to Malta: the fireworks component, which is responsible for 2.9% of the PM2.5 and which has health implications due to its chemical composition. The results of this work should also serve to guide the policy makers in achieving the necessary emission reductions in order to achieve the WHO guideline for PM2.5 by 2020.","PM,Positive matrix factorization,Natural aerosol sources,Anthropogenic aerosol sources,Source apportionment,Central mediterranean,"

"dns rebinding threat modeling and security analysis for local area network of maritime transportation systems","2023","Maritime ships and ports have become increasingly digital and intelligent. While intelligent maritime transportation systems bring convenience to the maritime industry, ship operation and management are also confronted with network risks. The Internet of Things (IoT) installed in the shipborne network collects and monitors the environmental data of the whole ship. It uses the collected data to make decisions to control the ship. The threat of Local Area Network (LAN) of IoT in ships has become an emerging issue. The DNS rebinding attack is a typical attack, which can bypass firewalls and seriously threaten the marine network in security and privacy of the local IoT. DNS rebinding attacks are difficult to model and detect, due to their sophisticated characteristics. In this work, we define threat models of DNS rebinding attacks and propose an effective method for the detection of and the defense against these attacks. First, we define threat models for DNS rebinding attacks. We employ a Markov chain to model the process of DNS rebinding attacks. With the threat modeling, the attack behaviors are clearly characterized and the most relevant attributes are thus extracted. Second, we propose an effective method for the detection of DNS rebinding attacks in the marine transportation system. The detection method includes the initialization method and the verification method, which manages and verifies access permission of equipment information and the service interface of the IoT in the shipborn network. Finally, we simulate the DNS rebinding attacks on the marine IoT. We analyze and test the security and the performance of the initialization method and the verification method in the simulated environment. The extensive experimental results demonstrate that the IoT in marine networks is vulnerable to DNS rebinding. Our method is effective and efficient to detect and defend against DNS rebinding attacks. It thus secures security and privacy in the local IoT on shipboard.","Markov processes,threat models,computer network security,DNS rebinding,marine transportation system,IoT,detection method,attack behaviors,Internet of Things,TTL,Marine vehicles,transportation,maritime ships,shipborne network,security of data,marine network,local IoT,network risks,ships,Servers,marine safety,marine engineering,maritime transportation,Local area networks,DNS rebinding attack,typical attack,DNs rebinding threat modeling,Computer crime,shipborn network,verification method,marine IoT,ship operation,intelligent maritime transportation systems,initialization method,Sensors,local area network,maritime industry,Internet,Security,authorisation,data privacy,threat detection,"

"aed-net: an abnormal event detection network","2019","It has long been a challenging task to detect an anomaly in a crowded scene. In this paper, a self-supervised framework called the abnormal event detection network (AED-Net), which is composed of a principal component analysis network (PCAnet) and kernel principal component analysis (kPCA), is proposed to address this problem. Using surveillance video sequences of different scenes as raw data, the PCAnet is trained to extract high-level semantics of the crowd’s situation. Next, kPCA, a one-class classifier, is trained to identify anomalies within the scene. In contrast to some prevailing deep learning methods, this framework is completely self-supervised because it utilizes only video sequences of a normal situation. Experiments in global and local abnormal event detection are carried out on Monitoring Human Activity dataset from University of Minnesota (UMN dataset) and Anomaly Detection dataset from University of California, San Diego (UCSD dataset), and competitive results that yield a better equal error rate (EER) and area under curve (AUC) than other state-of-the-art methods are observed. Furthermore, by adding a local response normalization (LRN) layer, we propose an improvement to the original AED-Net. The results demonstrate that this proposed version performs better by promoting the framework’s generalization capacity.","Kernel principal component analysis,Abnormal events detection,Principal component analysis network,Abnormal event detection network,"

"a deep learning framework for enhancing maritime coastal security","2021","The concerns of coastal security are very dynamic which depends on several factors like the neighbourhood of the country, the terrain and the marine traffic. As in the present system, only the vessels which emit Automatic Identification System (AIS) data streams can be detected and identified. Small vessels like some boats do not have AIS system setup, so they can get past without getting detected. Therefore, we propose a solution by framing a deep learning architecture namely faster region based convolutional neural network (Faster R-CNN) which accurately detects vessels in satellite images and outputs the latitude and longitude coordinates which when merged with AIS data helps identify whether the vessel is registered or not.

"insights into deglaciation of the largest ice-free area in the south shetland islands (antarctica) from quantitative analysis of the drainage system","2014","A quantitative geomorphic analysis of the drainage system on Byers Peninsula, Livingston Island, has been carried out in order to study the relief evolution, glacial history and possible neotectonic influence on the largest ice-free area of the South Shetlands archipelago. Aerial photographs, SAR data from RADARSAT-2 satellite, field work, a digital elevation model and GIS spatial analysis have been used to identify, map and study the existing drainage basins. A series of morphometric parameters have been studied in 30 selected basins in order to characterize their shape as well as the drainage network. Results in morphometric parameters reveal elongation trends in the shape of basins and a limited hierarchical network, common of a youthful stage of landscape evolution models. Several morphometric indexes (hypsometric integral, hypsometric curves, SL index, transverse topographical drainage basin asymmetry-T-Factor) have been used to study possible controls on drainage development. Results have been discussed in relation to relief and drainage evolution linked to the spatial distribution of lithological units and structural framework. T-Factor shows an apparently disorganized pattern and absence of tectonic influence. However, there are local values of second order basin asymmetry directions and magnitudes, which could reflect a succession of master rills through time, related to the changes in water supply during the deglaciation history of Byers Peninsula. Hypsometric values and curves of basins are also mainly related to a young stage of landscape evolution. Analysis of hypsometric integrals together with T-Factor index has allowed us to establish a possible deglaciation model on Byers Peninsula, which successfully explains the results. Areas of different landscape evolution stage are linked in space and support the hypothesis of local glacial centers during the ice cover retreat process. SL index results do not show the same pattern in results, which could be due to differences between incision and lateral shifting ratios. Quantitative geomorphic analysis indicates that during the deglaciation of Byers Peninsula, at least three areas acted as local glacial centers (NW, central and Rotch Dome area). Changes in index results clearly show a different behavior between two areas; distal areas and proximal areas close to the glacial centers. Morphometric indexes have demonstrated their being useful tools to provide information on the glacial history in recently deglaciated Antarctic areas.","Byers Peninsula,Quaternary,Glacial geomorphology,Fluvial,Permafrost,Relief evolution,"
"event processing in supply chain management – the status quo and research outlook","2019","Increasing supply chain complexity poses new challenges to managers. On the other hand, evolving information and communication technology offers ample opportunity for more reliable supply chain management practices. Event processing has established itself in many applications in logistics. Although the topic has enjoyed increasing popularity, there is no study taking stock of prior developments and guiding future research. Therefore, a systematic literature review on the topic of event processing in supply chain management from 2005 until the present is undertaken. Extant literature is synthesized and analyzed from technological and supply chain management perspectives to inform scholars and practitioners of existing field developments. Additionally, to guide future scholarly endeavors, a research agenda is derived from promising topics raised in papers and unfulfilled practical requirements. We find that current solutions primarily focus on a limited number of supply chain core processes and a restricted number of supply chain actors. The majority of publications focused on time-temperature sensitive products. Additionally, the domination of road transportation can be observed, while other modes of transport are often ignored in solution implementations. Decision support in terms of object traceability within the supply chain is found in most articles. RFID, typically accompanied by the Electronic Product Code Information Services standard, is the dominant enabling technology. Future research should focus on the topics of standardization, granularity, data sources, and cooperation. Moreover, holistic event processing supported by big data and machine learning techniques could create interfaces with other legacy business intelligence applications. Another promising area includes the exploration of new technologies, i.e. IoT, to enable new smart solutions.","Event processing,Logistics,Decision support,Research agenda,Supply chain event management,Literature review,"
"minimum winter temperature reconstruction from average earlywood vessel area of european oak (quercus robur) in n-poland","2016","Tree-ring-based temperature reconstructions form a substantial part of the international proxy data base used to examine and model global climate variations of the last Millennium. However, most tree-ring-based reconstructions are derived from study sites in the high latitudes or high altitudes, paying very little attention to low elevation sites. Thus, a large gap in the geographical coverage of climate reconstructions from temperate low elevation sites in central Europe still exists. This motivated us to concentrate our efforts on the European oak (Quercus robur) in N-Poland. We developed a new robust tree-ring width chronology (TRW), as well as four wood anatomical chronologies (e.g. average vessel area and number of vessels) from Q. robur for the period 1810 to 2010. The chronologies were examined for their climatological responses. While TRW was found to have weak correlations with climate, the earlywood vessel parameters (EVP), especially average vessel area (AVA), revealed significant positive correlations to minimum winter temperatures. Based on stable climate–growth correlations, a reconstruction of minimum winter temperatures (29th November to 20th January) back to 1810 was performed for north Poland. The reconstruction indicates a promising potential to reveal low-frequency climate information. An additional extreme year analysis suggested that in cold winters, a cold–warm–cold pattern in the minimum temperatures was responsible for the relatively small earlywood vessels. Spatial field correlations imply that our reconstruction is more related to temperature variations towards the east of Europe. The reconstructed temperature compared well with two existing temperature reconstructions, especially during most of the 20th century, even though the temperature reconstructions differ spatially and temporally. Based on these findings, the relatively extensive resource of archeological oak material from this region may be useful to perform multicentennial climate reconstructions in the temperate climate zone.","Temperature reconstruction,Poland,Temperate lowlands,Wood anatomy,Dendroclimatology,Earlywood vessel parameter,"
"enhancing maritime data standardization and integrity using docker and blockchain","2023","Massive maritime data is available nowadays to tackle vital industrial challenges such as autonomous vessels and carbon neutrality. These data can be collected on board vessels and shared with maritime stakeholders (e.g., ship owners and ship operators) for various missions. However, the current industrial practice lacks of a standardized framework and infras-tructure for data collection, sharing and analysis among different stakeholders. Moreover, the data integrity/trust is essential as tampering maliciously by any unexpected parties can severely undermine data trust and thus reducing the confidence of data utilization (e.g., results with AI). To address the above-mentioned challenges, this paper presents a solution using docker and blockchain named DataSafe to enhance data standardization and integrity. We also discuss several ongoing/potential applications of applying DataSafe in practice.","maritime stakeholders,board vessels,Blockchains,maritime data,data integrity,integrity,Marine vehicles,Standardization,vital industrial challenges,blockchains,Stakeholders,security of data,above-mentioned challenges,standardized framework,tam- perproof,blockchain,current industrial practice,data standardization,ship operators,ships,marine safety,marine engineering,data utilization,docker,carbon neutrality,Artificial intelligence,Carbon neutral,ship owners,infras-tructure,standardization,massive maritime data,Data collection,autonomous vessels,data trust,"
"efficient on-line anomaly detection for ship systems in operation","2019","We propose novel modifications to an anomaly detection methodology based on multivariate signal reconstruction followed by residuals analysis. The reconstructions are made using Auto Associative Kernel Regression (AAKR), where the query observations are compared to historical observations called memory vectors, representing normal operation. When the data set with historical observations grows large, the naive approach where all observations are used as memory vectors will lead to unacceptable large computational loads, hence a reduced set of memory vectors should be intelligently selected. The residuals between the observed and the reconstructed signals are analysed using standard Sequential Probability Ratio Tests (SPRT), where appropriate alarms are raised based on the sequential behaviour of the residuals. The modifications we introduce include: a novel cluster based method to select memory vectors to be considered by the AAKR, which gives an extensive reduction in computation time; a generalization of the distance measure, which makes it possible to distinguish between explanatory and response variables; and a regional credibility estimation used in the residuals analysis, to let the time used to identify if a sequence of query vectors represents an anomalous state or not, depend on the amount of data situated close to or surrounding the query vector. We demonstrate how the anomaly detection method and the proposed modifications can be successfully applied for anomaly detection on a set of imbalanced benchmark data sets, as well as on recent data from a marine diesel engine in operation.","Cluster based AAKR,Maritime industry,Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT),Anomaly detection,Auto Associative Kernel Regression (AAKR),Condition monitoring,"
"the impact of humidity on australia’s operational heatwave services","2022","More frequent and intense heatwaves in the last decade have challenged humanitarian, health and meteorological authorities to mitigate impact. Meteorological heatwave monitoring and prediction services vary between heatwave definitions which either include humidity or are based only on temperature. Incorporation of humidity into human health heatwave studies and warning services has been variable. Whilst higher humidity is a known stressor during heatwaves, humidity is known to confound interpretation of heatwave data and can be difficult to monitor and forecast. This study examines the effect of humidity on diagnosed heatwave severity across Australia’s diverse climate zones. Dry bulb temperature is used as the only input into the Bureau of Meteorology’s current operational Excess Heat Factor (EHF) index. Alternative humidity-affected temperature indices (Apparent Temperature, Wet Bulb Globe Temperature and Heat Index) are examined for suitability as input to EHF to compare the incidence of dry and humidity-affected heatwave severity within Australia. This paper uses maximum and minimum dry and humidity affected temperature indices extracted from Australia’s Bureau of Meteorology Atmospheric high-resolution Regional Reanalysis for Australia (BARRA). Our investigation demonstrates Australia’s operational temperature-only percentile-based heatwave severity service provides effective heatwave warning guidance for five of Australia’s six diverse climate zones. However, rare very dry or very humid heatwaves in the tropics require both dry bulb temperature-only and Heat Index versions of Excess Heat Factor (EHF) severity index to provide competent operational heatwave early warning guidance.","Tropical heatwaves,Heatwave severity,Heatwave warnings,Very dry heatwaves,Excess Heat Factor,Very humid heatwaves,"
"development of rolling-reduction structure vessel for maritime safety","2018","Safety incidents occurring in coastal areas in the course of leisure activities have been a social issue. In order to address such safety issues, there needs to be a way to rapidly respond to safety incidents. The current study aims to develop a vessel that floats on coastal waters with rolling-reduction shape, which can be used to rapidly respond to safety incidents and save human lives. The floating vessel was designed with a completely new shape, considering the efficiency, size, speed, and other design factors. This ship must have rolling reduction structure, as rescue personnel will be persistently present in it. As such, the bottom part of the ship body was designed using CFD analysis method. In addition, the rolling analysis for the ship body was conducted to comparatively analyze the rolling reduction effect of the design models and deduce the final shape of the vessel.","CFD analysis method,rescue vessel,rolling,Safety,design models,Marine vehicles,Mathematical model,hull design,rolling analysis,Sea measurements,computational fluid dynamics,safety,ship body,ships,Accidents,floating vessel,Shape,design engineering,Numerical models,rolling reduction,rolling reduction effect,maritime safety,"
"automated monitoring in maritime video surveillance system","2020","Maritime surveillance for intruders/illegal activities requires monitoring of a large area of the coastline. This task being manually exhaustive, would benefit immensely by application of object detection techniques to surveillance videos. However, object detection models trained on general objects datasets cannot be expected to give best performance for this scenario as marine vessels are only a small subset of these huge datasets and also do not classify the specific type of sea vehicle. Hence, their benchmarks are not appropriate for maritime surveillance. Some studies have been done with applications of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for ship/boat detection on private and publicly available sea vessels datasets. This paper presents a summary of the benchmarks so far and presents our experiments of the latest object detection techniques for combined marine vessels dataset.

Infrared image enhancement technology can provide high-quality images for follow-up search and rescue work and has significant research value.

According to the grayscale Gaussian distribution shape and gradient texture directionality of the target area, designs a target feature description operator and extracts the target feature image as the guide image for guided filtering. Then, the difference operation is performed between the original image and the filtering result, and the target detail layer that suppresses background noise and is not distorted is obtained. Finally, the target layer and the original image are fused with appropriate weights to obtain an enhanced image that retains the characteristics of the natural environment. The experimental results show that the method can effectively improve the clarity of the image and the detectability of the target.","target feature description operator,guide image,maritime infrared target images,Distortion,Information science,target enhancement,Feature extraction,image enhancement,Gray-scale,image layering,maritime infrared image,rescue work,Filtering,filtering theory,object detection,wave environments,Shape,feature extraction,image texture,maritime distress accidents,significant research value,infrared image enhancement technology,paper first analyzes,guided filtering,infrared imaging,target layer,high-quality images,severe wind,joint features,texture feature,maritime infrared targets,target feature image,Gaussian distribution,gradient texture directionality,"
"modeling and simulation in support of understanding maritime security and defense capabilities and requirements (the maritime timeline and analysis requirements toolset (m-tart))","2011","Those responsible for the Maritime Security of North America face a daunting task. The breadth of activities in the maritime domain makes it very difficult to achieve an acceptable level of understanding and control.

In order for the decision makers responsible for the Maritime Security and Defense of North America to effectively execute their missions, they require both an understanding of their current capabilities and gaps, and a means to determine the capability requirements to close any identified gaps. This paper presents the Maritime Timeline Analysis and Requirements Toolset (M-TART) as a modeling and simulation solution to address this problem.

According to the results of the comprehensive analysis by each region based on the eigenvector centrality outcome, Europe had a core keyword of modal shift, which refers to the conversion to eco-friendly vehicles due to the exhaust problem of land carriage, as well as the continuously implemented government policy. The results of China showed that the country’s task to solve was on studies aimed at reducing traffic jams in inland waterways using AIS data.

"an investigation on the non-stationarity of flood frequency across the uk","2021","Water infrastructure design and flood mitigation projects are currently based on a so-called stationary assumption. However, this assumption has been challenged in recent years due to increased extreme weather, potentially leading to the underestimation of flood quantiles and an increased risk of structural failures. In the present study, peak flow series from 158 gauging stations in the UK are analysed using both stationary and non-stationary models based on the generalised additive models for location, scale and shape (GAMLSS) framework. Nine candidate covariates are used for non-stationary models to obtain information on the significant drivers of non-stationarity in each flood series. Very few stations are thus found to show temporal trends, which suggests that time-varying non-stationary flood models may not always be suitable, and the use of physically-based covariates can provide better-fitting models. In particular, the non-stationary models using rainfall-related covariates display the best performance for the vast majority of stations, thus suggesting that the variability of the rainfall regime remains the dominant driver for changes in flooding. Moreover, two atmospheric circulation patterns, namely the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the East Atlantic Pattern, were found to be closely related to the non-stationarity of flooding at a number of stations. Unlike rainfall, however, the influence of these climate indices is not particularly dominant; hence, they are more suitably employed as components of a multiple-covariate non-stationary model. Besides, a direct linkage between the variability of flooding and climate changes has not been identified either regionally or globally. For the majority of stations (70%), the use of multiple covariates can provide a better non-stationary model than the use of a single covariate.","Flood frequency analysis,Covariate,Non-stationarity,GAMLSS,UK,"

The objective of this paper is to discuss the meteorological conditions during ISPOL in the context of long-term climate variability mainly in the north-western Weddell Sea region. This is done with a comprehensive climatology focusing on the seasonal and interannual variability of atmospheric and cryospheric data from 1979 to 2005. Key meteorological elements and weather patterns derived from NCEP/DOE Reanalysis 2 results and sea-ice data from passive microwave radiometer satellite observations are analyzed in combination with ISPOL in situ measurements. The monthly mean air temperature and the mean sea-level pressure were above the long-term average. The latter showed a very much extended variability and range associated with more frequent northerly to south-easterly winds.","Weddell Sea,Climate,ISPOL,Reanalysis,Variability,Sea-ice,"
"online fault detection in autonomous ferries: using fault-type independent spectral anomaly detection","2020","Enthusiasm for ship autonomy is flourishing in the maritime industry. In this context, data-driven prognostics and health management (PHM) systems have emerged as the optimal way to improve operational reliability and system safety. However, further research is needed to enhance the essential actions relating to such a system. Fault detection is the first and most crucial action of any data-driven PHM system. In this article, we propose a fault-type independent spectral anomaly detection algorithm for marine diesel engine degradation in autonomous ferries. The benefits of the algorithm are verified on three fault types where the nature of degradation differs. Both normal operation data and faulty degradation data have been collected from a marine diesel engine using two different engine load profiles. These profiles aim to replicate real autonomous ferry crossing operations, environmental conditions that the ferry may encounter. First, the data are subjected to a feature selection process to remove irrelevant and redundant features. Then, a multiregime normalization method is performed on the data to merge the engine loads into one context. Finally, a variational autoencoder is trained to estimate velocity and acceleration calculations of the anomaly score. Generic and dynamic threshold limits are simultaneously established to detect the fault time step online. The algorithm achieved an accuracy of 97.66% in the final test when the acceleration was used as the fault detector. The results suggest that the algorithm is independent of fault types with different nature of degradation related to the marine diesel engine.","operational reliability,generic threshold limit,acceleration calculation,fault-type independent spectral anomaly detection algorithm,variational autoencoder,engine loads,Anomaly detection,fault detector,reliability,multiregime normalization,Acceleration,ship autonomy,prognostics and health management (PHM),neural nets,Autonomous ferry,autonomous ferry crossing operations,system safety,data analysis,marine systems,ships,marine diesel engine degradation,Prognostics and health management,prognostics and health management system,online fault detection,dynamic threshold limit,Diesel engines,data-driven PHM system,mechanical engineering computing,feature selection,feature selection process,diesel engines,Fault detection,condition monitoring,Degradation,environmental conditions,marine diesel engine,maritime industry,failure analysis,Heuristic algorithms,multiregime normalization method,fault diagnosis,velocity calculation,faulty degradation data,"
"the use of current risk analysis tools evaluated towards preventing external domino accidents","2005","Risk analysis is an essential tool for company safety policy. Risk analysis consists of identifying and evaluating all possible risks. The efficiency of risk analysis tools depends on the rigueur of identifying and evaluating all possible risks.

The aim of this paper is to identify the current practice in the chemical industry subject to European Seveso legislation and to examine how the present methods can be integrated to improve safety policy, especially towards preventing major accidents. Moreover, conclusions on the prevention of catastrophic external domino accidents involving several companies are formulated.

"empirical analyses on maritime radio propagation","2004","Empirical analyses, based on extensive measurements results, were performed to characterize maritime radio propagation in the GSM1800 frequency band. As the height of sea waves increases, it blocks more of the Fresnel zones below the line-of-sight path. It is of interest, therefore, to examine the overall statistics of the received signal in rough sea surface conditions. The overall statistics of the received signal was found to be properly represented by a mixture of the Rician and log-normal distributions with varying Rician factor and standard deviation. From our observations, a coherent reflection component is voluntarily imposed over incoherent components, resulting in a large value of Rician factor, especially under small sea wave height or calm sea conditions. Fading depth and intensity were also evaluated.

"a hybrid network for maritime on-board communications","2012","Current maritime on-board communications have to be enhanced for safety and security, where ubiquitous technologies can help, together with providing comfort and convenience to the crew and passengers. Employing wireless sensor networks on board is one recent practice of implementing ubiquitous technology for ships, where further study is needed because of the connectivity challenges. Meanwhile, it is important for an on-board communication system to be reliable and flexible for handling emergency situations. In this paper, we propose a solution of employing ubiquitous technology on ships in a way that both connectivity and emergency handling are examined. Two key aspects of this proposal are: 1) combine different on-board communication networks into a hybrid system, enabling the cooperation between them, 2) smoothly integrate these networks with a consideration of backward compatibility, ease of deployment and connection to shore via Internet.

"the distribution and speciation of mercury in the california current: implications for mercury transport via fog to land","2018","Unfiltered seawater samples from vertical profiles collected at 60 stations within the California Current during four summer cruises spanning a two-year period from 2014 to 2015, were analyzed for elemental mercury (Hg°), monomethyl mercury (MMHg), dimethyl mercury (DMHg) and total mercury (THg). Fog water samples, taken at sea and throughout a network of land based stations were also analyzed for MMHg and THg. Vertical profiles indicate that midwater regions around 300 m are associated with concentration maxima in methylated species. Cyclonic mesoscale eddies were shown to be strong sources of the gaseous mercury species to the lower atmosphere and a likely source of these species to fog. Calculated evasive flux of Hg0 and DMHg were greatest in these regions (34 and 11 pmol m−2 d−1, respectively), whereas anticyclonic eddies support little or no sea-air evasion. Incubation experiments showed that DMHg is stable over short time scales at natural seawater pH (7.8–8.2) but degrades rapidly to MMHg at low pH. Demethylation of only a small percent of the evading DMHg, on acidic marine aerosols associated with fog condensation nuclei, can account for over 100% of the MMHg observed in fog. The surface microlayer, enriched in MMHg (by 30 ×), may also contribute to sea-air flux through aerosol production. Neither shelf sediments nor oxygen minimum zones appear to be a major source of methylated mercury in the California Current.","Microlayer,Monomethyl mercury,California current,Mesoscale eddies,Dimethyl mercury,Fog,"

"current state of goods, services and governance of the humboldt current large marine ecosystem in the context of climate change","2017","The Peru-Chile GEF-UNDP-Humboldt Current Large Marine Ecosystem Project successfully completed its first five-year phase. It included the delivery of ten thematic reports (TR), a Causal Chain Analysis (CCA), Ecosystem Diagnostic Analyses (EDA)(one each for Chile and Peru), a Transboundary Diagnostic Analysis (TDA) and a Strategic Action Program (SAP). The transboundary problems affecting the state of goods and services provided by the Humboldt Current Large Marine Ecosystem (HCLME) are: (1) non optimal use of fishing resources with socio-economic consequences; (2) anthropogenic disturbance of marine habitats after an increase in pollution levels within the HCLME; and (3) high incidental by-catch and associated fauna destruction and discards as a common problem for the two countries. Governance aspects developed during the past five years (2011-16) included, a “bottom-up” process in Peru and Chile linked to the establishment of new fishing and aquaculture acts, Marine Protected Areas and territorial use rights for artisanal fisheries, new methods for fish stock assessment, and ecolabelling of fisheries, among others. Management plans have been designed for pilot sites: the Juan Fernandez Archipelago in Chile; and Lobos de Tierra Island, Ballestas Islands and San Juan cape in Peru. A first Total Economic Value calculation of the goods and services provided by the HCLME in 2015 indicates a delivery of US$19.45 billion per annum. This value comprises 58% from Chile (US$ 11.28 billion) and 42% from Peru (US$ 8.17 billion). Additionally, the area of direct influence of the Humboldt Current System generates 77% (US$ 14.97 billion) of the value produced by the HCLME, where the tropical area of Peru and the southern area of Chile added 2% (US$ 0.45 billion) and 21% (US$ 4.03 billion), respectively. Possible scenarios of climate change in the HCLME were focused on the changes of biogeochemical alterations and forcing on the productivity and abundance-distribution of key species. Currently, high ocean productivity is an expression of the relatively high biomass of pelagic fish like anchovy, pacific jack mackerel and sardine, also other fishing resources like demersal fish (hake), cephalopod molluscs (squid), crustaceans (shrimp) have important contributions. Nevertheless, a deeper analysis of the impacts of climate on the fisheries and coastal areas of the HCLME is needed.","Governance,Services,Humboldt,Goods,Climate change,Ecosystem,"
"3-d multiobjective deployment of an industrial wireless sensor network for maritime applications utilizing a distributed parallel algorithm","2018","Effectively monitoring maritime environments has become a vital problem in maritime applications. Traditional methods are not only expensive and time consuming but also restricted in both time and space. More recently, the concept of an industrial wireless sensor network (IWSN) has become a promising alternative for monitoring next-generation intelligent maritime grids, because IWSNs are cost-effective and easy to deploy. This paper focuses on solving the issue of 3-D IWSN deployment in a 3-D engine room space of a very large crude-oil carrier and also considers numerous power facilities. To address this 3-D IWSN deployment problem for maritime applications, a 3-D uncertain coverage model is proposed that uses a modified 3-D sensing model and an uncertain fusion operator. The deployment problem is converted into a multiobjective optimization problem that simultaneously addresses three objectives: coverage, lifetime, and reliability. Our goal is to achieve extensive coverage, long network lifetime, and high reliability. We also propose a distributed parallel cooperative coevolutionary multiobjective large-scale evolutionary algorithm for maritime applications. We verify the effectiveness of this algorithm through experiments by comparing it with five state-of-the-art algorithms.

The proposed scheme consists of two stages: target prioritization based on fuzzy logic and a beam scheduling approach that transmits surveillance beam and tracking beams for each target appropriately. The proposed beam scheduling scheme also takes into account the imperfect detection of targets in real situation. A conventional heuristic beam scheduling approach was modified to incorporate binary integration in radar theory into the RRM strategy. The resulting scheme efficiently handles the complicated beam scheduling problem by considering the target priority as well as the imperfect detection of targets of a real maritime MFR.

"late holocene climate variability from lake pupuke maar, auckland, new zealand","2013","Spectral analyses of quasi-annual organo-diatomaceous laminae couplets in an Auckland maar lake indicate brief (sub-decadal scale) episodes with strong spectral power and long periods of weak to no spectral power between c. 1700 to c. 550 cal. yr BP. Laminae couplet thickness appears to be a function of changes in wind flow over the basin, with enhanced wind flow deepening the mixing zone and providing additional nutrients for laminae formation. Aeolian dust from Australia amplifies the wind signal. Spectral signals in the high power episodes are focused in <4 years and 6–8 years windows. These are consistent with El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) periodicity.

"a systematic literature review on rams analysis for critical infrastructures protection","2021","Reliability, Availability, Maintainability, and Safety/Security (RAMS) analysis of Critical Infrastructures (CIs) can be applied to investigate their performance subjected to failure modes. The literature has witnessed earlier research approaches to RAM analysis. However, the integration of cybersecurity or safety aspects, along with the RAM to develop RAMS analysis methods, tools, and models, is a significant aspect for protecting CIs as their digitalization is progressing. In recent times, digital components and systems comprising information and communication technologies, smart devices, efficient gateways, faster protocols have transformed the CIs. This transformation comes with a considerable cost, such as the necessity to integrate innovative cyber-defense measures and policies due to new vulnerabilities, efficient maintenance strategies, risk management scenario development, resilience with self-healing architecture. Nevertheless, the current knowledge body lacks an up-to-date Systematic Literature Review (SLR) focused on addressing integrated protection aspects, recent developments, and evaluation criteria towards RAMS analysis for CIs. Accordingly, this study aims to provide a comprehensive SLR on existing studies dealing with developing techniques, methodologies, protocols, models, and RAMS analysis tools for different applications. This SLR followed the recommendations of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. 1513 records published between 2011 and 2020 are initially identified, which are later screened to 212 records to be considered for the eligibility check process. Finally, after examining the exclusion and inclusion criteria, a total of 19 articles are included in this research. In this SLR, a comparative analysis of existing solutions based on included studies is presented in different aspects such as developed architectures and methodologies, performance evaluation mechanisms, implementation scenarios, targeted applications, pros and cons, and applied CIs protection aspects associated with RAMS. The findings suggest that RAMS analysis for CIs is an emerging research area, with currently focused applications including power grid stations, Cyber-Physical Systems, cloud computing, maritime transportation, and Industrial Control Systems. 36.8% of the studies have performed a real-time implementation, while the remaining approaches have either performed simulation or preliminary analysis. Also, 84.2% of the included studies focus on integrating only three aspects of CIs protection. Finally, the open research challenges and limitations of existing studies and their respective emerging solutions are presented.","Protection,Critical infrastructures,RAMS,Literature review,"
"a novel spatiotemporal filtering for dim small infrared maritime target detection","2022","Robust small target detection of low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is very important in infrared searching and tracking, precision guidance, pre-warning, etc. In this paper, we propose a novel spatial based anisotropic Gaussian differential filtering system, which improves the accuracy and stability of dim small maritime target by enhancing signal strength with morphological characteristics. First, we extract and analyze the data mode of dim small target and reconstruct them by Gaussian functions. In order to suppress noise and enhance the weak morphological features, we develop a 2D anisotropic Gaussian difference function to strengthen target's direction features. In addition, by combining the multi scale pyramid with directional filter bank(DFB), the filter can be orientation selectivity and scale selectivity. Finally, as a supplement, the target region is extracted by the adaptive threshold segmentation method, and the signal is accumulated and marked by a pipeline filter. Experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively strengthen the morphological feature of the target and weaken the noise of background, thereby improving the detection probability of the target. The results demonstrate its superior and reliable performance by a high detection rate and low false alarm rate.","Pipelines,morphological characteristics,orientation selectivity,image denoising,dim small infrared maritime target detection,signal strength,weak morphological features,Feature extraction,background suppression factor (BSF),Stability analysis,anisotropic Gaussian differential filtering system,data mode,Gaussian functions,scale selectivity,low signal-to-noise ratio,detection probability,infrared small target detection,Filter banks,spatiotemporal filtering,pipeline filter,morphological feature,Target tracking,object detection,feature extraction,target region,Gaussian processes,image reconstruction,Spatial filters,2D anisotropic Gaussian difference function,spatial filter,precision guidance,direction features,Object detection,difference of Gaussian(DoG),multiscale pyramid,"
"mercury vapor and other volatile components in the air as guides to ore deposits","1972","Several gaseous elements and compounds have been found to occur in anomalous concentrations in soil gas or air over mineral deposits. These gases or vapors include mercury, sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine. Ore deposits buried by as much as several hundred meters of barren or postmineral overburden have been detected, and buried faults, fractures, and zones of tectonic disturbance have been mapped by use of gas anomalies. Some gases are measured directly with sensitive instrumental methods while others are concentrated and analyzed by traditional analytical methods. Temperature, barometric pressure, and other meteorological parameters influence gas anomalies, although their effects are incompletely understood.

"use of landsat data to track historical water quality changes in florida keys marine environments","2014","Satellite remote sensing has shown the advantage of water quality assessment at synoptic scales in coastal regions, yet modern sensors such as SeaWiFS or MODIS did not start until the late 1990s. For non-interrupted observations, only the Landsat series have the potential to detect major water quality events since the 1980s. However, such ability is hindered by the unknown data quality or consistency through time. Here, using the Florida Keys as a case study, we demonstrate an approach to identify historical water quality events through improved atmospheric correction of Landsat data and cross-validation with concurrent MODIS data. After aggregation of the Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) 30-m pixels to 240-m pixels (to increase the signal-to-noise ratio), a MODIS-like atmospheric correction approach using the Landsat shortwave-infrared (SWIR) bands was developed and applied to the entire Landsat-5 TM data series between 1985 and 2010. Remote sensing reflectance (RRS) anomalies from Landsat (2 standard deviations from a pixel-specific monthly climatology) were found to detect MODIS RRS anomalies with over 90% accuracy for all three bands for the same period of 2002–2010. Extending this analysis for the entire Landsat-5 time-series revealed RRS anomaly events in the 1980s and 1990s, some of which are corroborated by known ecosystem changes due in part to changes in local freshwater flow. Indeed, TM RRS anomalies were shown to be useful in detecting shifts in seagrass density, turbidity increases, black water events, and phytoplankton blooms. These findings have large implications for ongoing and future water quality assessment in the Florida Keys as well as in many other coastal regions.","Remote sensing,Water quality,Seagrass,Atmospheric correction,"
"energy-efficient trajectory design for uav-aided maritime data collection in wind","2022","Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), especially fixed-wing ones that withstand strong winds, have great potential for oceanic exploration and research. This paper studies a UAV-aided maritime data collection system with a fixed-wing UAV dispatched to collect data from marine buoys. We aim to minimize the UAVâ€™s energy consumption in completing the task by jointly optimizing the communication time scheduling among the buoys and the UAVâ€™s flight trajectory subject to wind effect. The conventional successive convex approximation (SCA) method can provide efficient sub-optimal solutions for collecting small/moderate data volume, whereas the solution heavily relies on trajectory initialization and has not explicitly considered wind effect, while the computational/trajectory complexity both become prohibitive for the task with large data volume. To this end, we propose a new cyclical trajectory design framework with tailored initialization algorithm that can handle arbitrary data volume efficiently, as well as a hybrid offline-online (HO2) design that leverages convex stochastic programming (CSP) offline based on wind statistics, and refines the solution by adapting online to real-time wind velocity. Numerical results show that our optimized trajectory can better adapt to various setups with different target data volume and buoysâ€™ topology as well as various wind speed/direction/variance compared with benchmark schemes. In particular, our proposed HO2 design can effectively adapt to random wind variations with feasible and robust online operation, and proactively exploit the wind for further energy savings in both single-buoy and multi-buoy scenarios.","unmanned aerial vehicles,wind statistics,wind effect,aircraft power systems,successive convex approximation,Energy consumption,SCA,convex programming,energy-efficient trajectory design,control engineering computing,hybrid offline-online design,trajectory complexity,Wireless communication,flight trajectory,data acquisition,single-buoy scenarios,real-time wind velocity,target data volume,communication time scheduling,oceanic exploration,UAV-aided maritime data collection system,Maritime data collection,HO2 design,random wind variations,hybrid offline-online (HO2),trajectory initialization,Wind speed,unmanned aerial vehicle,wind direction,energy savings,marine buoys,convex stochastic programming,Real-time systems,autonomous aerial vehicles,wind speed,wind,trajectory control,Trajectory,energy consumption,cyclical trajectory design,computational complexity,mobile robots,energy conservation,sub-optimal solutions,stochastic programming (SP),aerospace computing,Task analysis,multibuoy scenarios,Data collection,approximation theory,stochastic programming,fixed-wing UAV,CSP,"
"chapter ii - evaluation of hazard and risk analysis","2017","Hazards and risks are very plant specific. So, to address the many varieties of risk there are a number of ways to address them. Detailed selection processes are discussed to select the best one suitable for the plant. Hazard analysis is the primary step toward plant hazard analysis (PHA). A rigorous treatment is presented to focus on various factors with special reference to major incidents and for major hazard facilities (MHFs) and HAZID. In addition to outline discussions on various PHA methods, detailed discussions are presented on task analysis to take into account human action errors. Starting from qualitative risk analysis, various independent protection layers are chosen to arrive at semiquantitative risk analysis. Control measures play a very big role in risk analysis. Detailed discussions are presented to address these control measures so that safety of the facilities can be ensured. For complex systems, quantitative risk analysis (QRA) is quite common, so QRA with statistical approaches is covered. Safety management systems are covered to ensure total safety for MHFs.

"the atmospheric controls of extreme convective events over the southern arabian peninsula during the spring season","2021","Mesoscale Convective Systems (MCSs) over the southern Arabian Peninsula are more common during the spring months of March and April. In this paper, the processes behind such severe convective events and their local-scale impacts are investigated using reanalysis data, satellite-derived and observational products. The analysis of 95 MCS events from 2000 to 2020 revealed that they are triggered by low-level wind convergence and moisture advection from the Arabian Sea, Arabian Gulf and/or Red Sea. An equatorward displacement and strengthening of the subtropical jet also precondition the environment, as does the presence of a mid-level trough. The latter is generally part of a large-scale pattern of anomalies that are equivalent barotropic in nature, and therefore likely a response to tropical or subtropical forcing. At more local-scale, a drying of the mid-troposphere between 850 and 250 hPa typically by 50%, a reduction of the upper-level winds by about 5 m s−1, and an increase in the upper-tropospheric temperature on average by 2–3 K, are typically observed during MCS events. Over the 21-year period, a statistically significant increase in the MCSs' duration over southeast Arabian Peninsula has been found, suggesting that such extreme events may be even more impactful in a warming world.","Local-scale impacts,Arid regions,Mesoscale convective systems,Climate change,Transition seasons,Large-scale triggers,"

"realistic extended target model for track before detect in maritime surveillance","2015","Traditional target tracking algorithms are generally fed a set of thresholded detections under the hypothesis that no more than one detection is generated by each single target. Improvements in modern radar systems have made possible to obtain high resolution data of the targets, making them occupy more than a single resolution cell, and have made necessary to use appropriate Extended Target Tracking (ETT) techniques, since the aforementioned hypothesis is no longer valid. However, these techniques do not often take into account the physical phenomena that are involved in the radar-sea-target system. This paper explores some of the effects involved in the transmission, propagation, backscattering and processing of the radar signal in a maritime environment, that have a crucial importance in ETT. A statistical model that considers the featured effects is developed and tested in a particle filter based Track before Detect (TbD) algorithm. Accounting for physical aspects, good outcomes in both kinematic (i.e. position and velocity) and size (i.e. width and length) estimation can be pointed out using real radar data acquired by a high resolution X-band Marine radar located in the Gulf of La Spezia, Italy.","maritime surveillance environment,marine radar,radar-sea-target system,Radar antennas,radar detection,statistical model,data acquisition,Italy,Antenna radiation patterns,TbD algorithm,statistical analysis,target tracking,Target tracking,particle filtering (numerical methods),Gulf of La Spezia,radar signal backscattering,search radar,Radar tracking,radar signal propagation,Convolution,radar signal processing,high resolution X-band marine radar,radar tracking,track before detect algorithm,radar signal transmission,Clutter,radar resolution,extended target tracking technique,particle filter,data target resolution,backscatter,ETT technique,oceanographic techniques,"
"air quality improvement during covid-19 pandemic: study of land and maritime pollution","2021","COVID-19 pandemic forced many countries to adopt lockdown measures, temporarily closing factories, diminish maritime traffic and reducing the mobility of people in the cities. Analysis from the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) on board Europe's Sentinel-5P and Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS), for the first wave of COVID-19 in 2020, have shown a substantial improvement in air quality. More specifically, since lockdown until the end of April, Lisbon and Porto were at their lowest PM10 levels in 2 years, while Madrid had a significant drop with values considerably below 2018 levels but still close to 2019 values. In terms of NO2 levels, Lisbon had an historical minimum of the last 2 years during most of April 2020 and Madrid had 2-year lowest level since lockdown.

"convolutional neural network-based novel framework for ship recognition in poor visibility maritime surveillance videos","2023","Ship recognition is a central component of the information perception for smart ships. Traditionally, the ship recognition mission is completed by remote sensing or synthetic aperture radar (SAR) or manual calibration via maritime surveillance video. However, the difficulty arises in implementing the mission when it suffers the weather with a poor visibility. The recognition accuracy may deteriorate dramatically in such a hostile environment, especially in the heavy fog environment at sea when using conventional methods. In this case, we develop a novel framework for ship recognition based on a smart recognition system that relies on the dark channel defogging and the neural networks. First, a dark-channel defogging algorithm is utilized to remove the adverse impact of poor visibility on recognition. After that, three different neural networks are used to train the defogged images (Specifically: Faster-RCNN, SSD, YOLOv3). Finally, we present qualitative and quantitative analyses of three different neural network models. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in a hostile environment, especially in fog weather with poor visibility at sea.","Image recognition,Neural networks,Ship recognition,Sea surface,Visualization,Surveillance,Robust framework,Marine vehicles,Statistical analysis,Convolutional Neural Networks,Defog method,"

The data was collected in shallow coastal waters of up to 18 m water depth (Baltic Sea) close to an ammunition dumping site characterized by an almost flat seafloor covered with sand and silt sediments.

"holocene hydrological changes in europe and the role of the north atlantic ocean circulation from a speleothem perspective","2021","Societal concerns about future hydroclimate changes urge a thorough understanding of the governing processes. Here, an analysis of Middle and Late Holocene speleothem-based hydroclimate reconstructions and paleoclimate model simulations reveals sub-millennial fluctuations in the spatiotemporal variability of precipitation in the European and Mediterranean regions, that complements previous dendrochronological and pollen-based reconstructions with an improved temporal resolution. Although insolation forcing is the primary driver of Holocene hydroclimate changes in Europe on a multimillennial scale, the evaluation of the principal component analysis of speleothem records and correlations with sea surface temperature data indicates that North Atlantic ocean circulation played a significant role in the sub-millennial variation of continental moisture transport, with an increasing importance during the Late Holocene. The combined evaluation of speleothem-based data, climate simulations and sea surface temperature records therefore advances our understanding of the governing processes of Holocene hydroclimate changes in the European and Mediterranean regions.","European and mediterranean regions,Principal component analysis,Holocene hydroclimate,Speleothems,Ocean circulations,Stable isotope compositions,"
"common vocabulary set for support of interoperability of data contents of maritime equipment and systems in e-navigation services","2016","In the maritime field, e-navigation, the new maritime service environment paradigm, is a topic of wide discussion. According to the e-navigation concept, the various marine and marine-related domains' data both on- and off-shore are used as resources for maritime services, the purpose of which are to facilitate communication at sea and to ensure safe navigation. To those ends, e-navigation services exchange, share, and utilize data resources created and distributed according to the data product specifications based on the e-navigation Common Maritime Data Structure (CMDS). Currently, maritime equipment and systems transfer data among themselves over ships' networks. In e-navigation, those equipment and systems' data will be utilized as useful data resources. But before that data can be used, it is necessary to create and distribute it according to the above-noted CMDS-based data product specifications. When a data product specification is developed for a specific domain, a common vocabulary for that domain is needed for consistent specification of the data elements that represent the data contents. In this paper, we present a common vocabulary set for consistent representation of the data elements of maritime equipment and systems shipboard. To build the common vocabulary set, we analyzed the digital interface standards for maritime navigation and radio- communication equipment and systems.

"rare earth elements and yttrium as tracers of waste/rock-groundwater interactions","2022","Increasing concentrations of Rare Earth Elements (REE) plus yttrium (REY) are entering the environment due to human activities. The similar chemical behaviour across the whole REY, i.e. the lanthanide series (lanthanum to lutetium) and yttrium, allows their use as tracers, fingerprinting rock-forming processes and fluid-rock interactions in earth science systems. However, their use in fingerprinting waste and particularly low-level radioactive waste has not received much attention, despite the direct use of REE in the nuclear industry and the traditional use of REE as proxies to understand the environmental mobility of the actinide series (actinium to lawrencium). The highly instrumented low-level radioactive waste site at Little Forest (Australia) allows a detailed REY study, investigating interactions with local strata, neighbouring waste forms and shallow groundwater flows. Groundwater samples and solids from cored materials were recovered from 2007 to 2012 from the study site and regional baseline sites in the same geological materials. The REY in water samples were analysed by automated chelation pre-concentration (SeaFast, ESI) followed by ICP-MS determination, while solid samples were analysed using Neutron Activation Analysis (NAA) and X-ray fluorescence scanning (ITRAX). Solid rocks showed no REY departed from typical Upper Crust compositions in either Little Forest or regional background sites. Shallow groundwater from ~4–5 m, at or slightly below waste trench levels, showed water-waste interaction as a marked enrichment, relative to shale-normalised patterns, in samarium, europium and gadolinium, with depleted yttrium. Leachate samples from the neighbouring urban landfill show different REY normalised patterns. REY distribution changes with depth through increased interaction with shales and sandstones. Variations in pH and redox conditions lead to widespread precipitation of Fe-hydroxides, which scavenge REY with differential uptake by precipitating solids, resulting in increases in Y and higher Y/Ho ratio in the groundwater along the flow path. Our study revealed that the Little Forest low-level radioactive waste has a REY fingerprint different to that of groundwater in surrounding land uses. REY can be used to fingerprint diverse waste sources, assess the mobility of lanthanides inferring the mobility of selected actinides, and to trace the fate of REY during groundwater recharge. The approach presented can refine source allocation and trace pollutant mobility in current and legacy urban, mixed and radioactive waste sites around the world.","Waste-rock interaction,Rare earth elements and yttrium (REY),Low-level nuclear waste,Landfill,Tritium,Little Forest Legacy Site,"

"energy-efficient cyclical trajectory design for uav-aided maritime data collection in wind","2020","Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), especially fixed-wing ones that withstand strong winds, have great potential for oceanic exploration and research. This paper studies a UAVaided maritime data collection system with a fixed-wing UAV dispatched to collect data from marine buoys. We aim to minimize the UAV's energy consumption in completing the task by jointly optimizing the communication time scheduling among the buoys and the UAV's flight trajectory subject to wind effect, which is a non-convex problem and difficult to solve optimally. Existing techniques such as the successive convex approximation (SCA) method provide efficient sub-optimal solutions for collecting small/moderate data volume, whereas the solution heavily relies on the trajectory initialization and has not explicitly considered the wind effect, while the computational complexity and resulted trajectory complexity both become prohibitive for the task with large data volume. To this end, we propose a new cyclical trajectory design framework that can handle arbitrary data volume efficiently subject to wind effect. Specifically, the proposed UAV trajectory comprises multiple cyclical laps, each responsible for collecting only a subset of data and thereby significantly reducing the computational/trajectory complexity, which allows searching for better trajectory initialization that fits the buoys' topology and the wind. Numerical results show that the proposed cyclical scheme outperforms the benchmark oneflight-only scheme in general. Moreover, the optimized cyclical 8-shape trajectory can proactively exploit the wind and achieve lower energy consumption compared with the case without wind.","unmanned aerial vehicles,wind effect,energy-efficient cyclical trajectory design,convex approximation,Energy consumption,convex programming,Acceleration,scheduling,nonconvex problem,communication time scheduling,UAV trajectory,oceanic exploration,8-shape trajectory,Maritime data collection,data volume,trajectory initialization,Wind speed,unmanned aerial vehicle,strong winds,UAV energy consumption,marine buoys,UAV-aided maritime data collection,autonomous aerial vehicles,nonlinear programming,Unmanned aerial vehicles,Trajectory,energy consumption,cyclical trajectory design,computational complexity,multiple cyclical laps,sub-optimal solutions,Task analysis,UAV flight trajectory subject,Data collection,approximation theory,fixed-wing UAV,energy efficiency,"
"relationships between safety culture aspects – a work process to enable interpretation","2014","Knowledge about the existing safety culture in a maritime organization such as in shipping companies or on board ships can enable the formulation of effective interventions to maintain and improve safety culture and safety in the organization. When assessing the safety culture, questionnaires developed for this purpose are often used. This paper proposes a work process that facilitates the analysis and interpretation of the relationships between safety culture aspects using questionnaire data. The work process includes the use of variable cluster analysis where the cluster solutions are presented in dendrograms. These were found to be an excellent way to visualize complex relationships in the quantitative data and to facilitate the understanding of the safety culture concept. Results are presented from applying the statistical process to safety culture data from six Swedish ships in international traffic. The visualized safety culture results can enable group discussions about safety on different organizational levels and can constitute an important input to the continuous improvement processes for safety and safety culture.","Maritime safety,Safety management,Safety culture,Cluster analysis,"
"knowledge discovery using genetic algorithm for maritime situational awareness","2014","Due to the large volume of data related to vessels, to manually pore through and to analyze the information in a bid to identify potential maritime threat is tedious, if at all possible. This study aims to enhance maritime situational awareness through the use of computational intelligence techniques in detecting anomalies. A knowledge discovery system based on genetic algorithm termed as GeMASS was proposed and investigated in this research. In the development of GeMASS, a machine learning approach was applied to discover knowledge that is applicable in characterizing maritime security threats. Such knowledge is often implicit in datasets and difficult to discover by human analysts. As the knowledge relevant to maritime security may vary from time to time, GeMASS was specified to learn from streaming data and to generate up-to-date knowledge in a dynamic fashion. Based on the knowledge discovered, the system functions to screen vessels for anomalies in real-time. Traditionally in maritime security studies, datasets that are applied as knowledge sources are related to vessels’ geographical and movement information. This study investigated a novel leverage of multiple data sources, including Automatic Identification System, classification societies, and port management and security systems for the enhancement of maritime security. A prototype of GeMASS was developed and employed as a vehicle to study and demonstrate the functions of the proposed methodology.","Defense,Maritime security,Genetic algorithm,Knowledge discovery,Decision support,Machine learning,"
"a provisional climatology of cool-season convective lines in the uk","2013","A 7-year climatology of cool-season convective lines in the UK has been constructed using archived radar rainfall data. 103 lines meeting basic size, duration and intensity criteria were identified over the period September 2003 to February 2010. Of these, 87% occurred in association with frontal systems (mostly cold fronts). The remaining 13% occurred within polar-maritime air masses to the rear of frontal systems. Annual frequencies were highest over inland areas of southern and central England (5.0–7.5 events per 10,000km2, per year) and decreased markedly to the north (<1.0 events per 10,000km2, per year over north and west Scotland). Tornado and Storm Research Organisation (TORRO) tornado data revealed that 27.2% of lines produced at least one tornado. The environment of tornadic and non-tornadic lines was investigated by analysis of available observations, from which representative values of various environmental parameters were obtained. Tornadic lines were found to be associated with significantly larger pre-line surface-based CAPE, line-normal forward motion, cross-line horizontal wind veer, and cross-line temperature decrease. Furthermore, a tendency for tornadic lines to occur near the core, or under the left exit region, of mid-level jets was apparent.","Cold front,Tornado,Squall line,Line convection,Severe convection,TORRO,"
"scalable anomaly-based intrusion detection for secure internet of things using generative adversarial networks in fog environment","2023","The data generated exponentially by a massive number of devices in the Internet of Things (IoT) are extremely high-dimensional, large-scale, non-labeled, which poses great challenges to timely analysis and effective decision making for anomaly detection in IoT. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised deep learning method to identify anomalies against IoT networks, which exploits Bidirectional Generative Adversarial Networks (BiGAN) to build model on normal IoT data. The model introduces Wasserstein distance to capture and learn the distribution of high-dimensional raw data and focuses on latent representations using an auxiliary classifier. A cycle consistency connection between data is designed to prevent information loss that helps to reduce false positive rate. The model detects outliers by utilizing reconstruction error in feature space. Another challenge facing the current anomaly detection solutions is their limited scalability, which restricts capability in handling big IoT data. This issue is resolved by deploying and jointly training the proposed method in a fog computing environment. The anomaly-based intrusion detection can be scalable by leveraging the flexibility of fog computing, which contributes to supporting efficient detection. Experimental results on two recent datasets (i.e., UNSW-NB15 and CIC-IDS2017) validate that the proposed method achieves 4% increase in accuracy and 4% reduction in false alarm rate than the state-of-the-art methods while keeping computational efficiency.","Intrusion detection,Anomaly detection,Internet of Things,Generative adversarial networks,Fog computing,"
"primary drivers of multidecadal spatial and temporal patterns of shoreline change derived from optical satellite imagery","2022","Understanding and predicting shoreline change along sandy coasts requires continuous (in both time and space) long-term (decades) shoreline data at good spatial (e.g. 100 s of metres) and temporal (e.g. months) resolution. Publicly available satellite imagery can now provide such time series. However, satellite-derived shorelines (SDS) are associated with uncertainties, particularly at high-energy meso-macrotidal coasts, which challenge the assessment of long-term trends and interannual variability. In this paper we address the 1984–2020 time- and space-evolution of 269 km of high-energy meso-macrotidal sandy coast in southwest France using uncertain (no tide and runup correction) SDS data. The shoreline trends are validated with field data collected over the period 2008–2019. Over 1984–2020, the shoreline eroded by 0.55 m/yr with maximum erosion (accretion) reaching 15.61 m/yr (6.94 m/yr), with the largest changes observed along coasts adjacent to the inlet and estuary mouths. We show that, away from the presence of ebb-tide deltas and swash bars affecting offshore wave transformation and nearshore circulation, the long-term shoreline trend is well explained by the gradients in longshore drift computed from a regional wave hindcast and an empirical longshore transport formula. By averaging the yearly SDS along the entire coastline, we find that interannual shoreline variability is well correlated with the winter West Europe Pressure Anomaly (WEPA), which outscores the other conventional teleconnection pattern indices. WEPA even explains >80 % of the space-averaged shoreline variability over the recent period 2014–2020 when more and higher quality satellite images are available. A more local assessment of the links between climate indices and shoreline response shows that correlation with all climate indices dramatically drops downdrift of the large-scale estuary mouths and inlets. This suggests that along this 10–20 km stretch of downdrift coast, shoreline response is controlled factors internal to the estuary mouth/inlet system. The rest of the coast is mostly controlled by factors external to the system, which are primarily the variability in winter-mean wave height correlated to winter WEPA index. Overall, we demonstrate that an adapted space-averaging of uncorrected (noisy) SDS dataset can allow addressing the time- and space variability of shoreline change and their primary drivers including large-scale climate patterns of atmospheric variability. We also advocate that such SDS analysis can be performed along any coastline in the world in order to guide future model development and application.","Internal and external controls,Chronic erosion,Inlet and estuary mouth,Wave climate indices,Interannual shoreline variability,"
"target detection of maritime search and rescue: saliency accumulation method","2012","Target detection using visual image sequence is an important task of maritime search and rescue. A novel saliency accumulation approach is proposed. Each frame of image sequence is firstly transformed to LAB space. The saliency maps for two color channels and intensity channel are obtained by spectral residual in frequency domain and the local saliency in space domain taking advantages of both approaches. Then saliency map of every frame is fusion of those from each weighted feature. In order to reduce the sea clutters or detect the weak small target, the saliency maps from successive frames are accumulated to reach a binary saliency map by applying a threshold.

"changes in precipitation extremes projected by a 20-km mesh global atmospheric model","2016","High-resolution modeling is necessary to project weather and climate extremes and their future changes under global warming. A global high-resolution atmospheric general circulation model with grid size about 20km is able to reproduce climate fields as well as regional-scale phenomena such as monsoonal rainfall, tropical and extratropical cyclones, and heavy precipitation. This 20-km mesh model is applied to project future changes in weather and climate extremes at the end of the 21st century with four different spatial patterns in sea surface temperature (SST) changes: one with the mean SST changes by the 28 models of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) under the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP)-8.5 scenario, and the other three obtained from a cluster analysis, in which tropical SST anomalies derived from the 28 CMIP5 models were grouped. Here we focus on future changes in regional precipitation and its extremes. Various precipitation indices averaged over the Twenty-two regional land domains are calculated. Heavy precipitation indices (maximum 5-day precipitation total and maximum 1-day precipitation total) increase in all regional domains, even where mean precipitation decrease (Southern Africa, South Europe/Mediterranean, Central America). South Asia is the domain of the largest extreme precipitation increase. In some domains, different SST patterns result in large precipitation changes, possibly related to changes in large-scale circulations in the tropical Pacific.","High-resolution,GCM,Climate change,Heavy precipitation,"

"3d radar - modeling virtual maritime environment for the static environment perception","2013","Electromagnetic propagation has been a subject of interest, mostly in applied physics research and atmospheric physics over many decades. Contributions have been more towards more theoretical rather than experimental. With the advancement of radar and laser technology and regular use in achieving military related objectives, electromagnetic wave propagation has now become a matter of interest to computer scientists. Today's military services have faced challenges of maintaining financial stability of training activities. Thus most of them focus into computational simulators can be used as a safe alternative in a cost beneficial manner. Considering field of military, radar simulators plays important role in simulations. This research focuses on simulating sea-born radar for 3D virtual maritime environment. Proposed approach takes the 3D environment as the input and maps the objects via electromagnetic wave properties. It captures the surrounding objects and gives the 2D visualization of the 3D environment as the end result. In the static environment perception both radar and environment are considered to be stagnant. This approach uses efficient techniques to achieve a 2D visualization of the 3D environment by embedding electromagnetic wave properties like reflection, refraction, polarization, diffraction and attenuation in wave propagation.

On board of vessels, the failure of the GNSS receiver propagates to multiple systems, like the Automatic Information System (AIS) transponder, the ship's gyro calibration system and the digital selective calling system. The AIS itself can suffer from failures due to interference in the VHF band, and the lack of bandwidth makes it difficult to introduce security any security mechanisms.

"increasing net co2 uptake by a danish beech forest during the period from 1996 to 2009","2011","The exchange of CO2 between the atmosphere and a beech forest near Sorø, Denmark, was measured continuously over 14years (1996–2009). The simultaneous measurement of many parameters that influence CO2 uptake makes it possible to relate the CO2 exchange to recent changes in e.g. temperature and atmospheric CO2 concentration. The net CO2 exchange (NEE) was measured by the eddy covariance method. Ecosystem respiration (RE) was estimated from nighttime values and gross ecosystem exchange (GEE) was calculated as the sum of RE and NEE. Over the years the beech forest acted as a sink of on average of 157gCm−2yr−1. In one of the years only, the forest acted as a small source. During 1996–2009 a significant increase in annual NEE was observed. A significant increase in GEE and a smaller and not significant increase in RE was also found. Thus the increased NEE was mainly attributed to an increase in GEE. The overall trend in NEE was significant with an average increase in uptake of 23gCm−2yr−2. The carbon uptake period (i.e. the period with daily net CO2 gain) increased by 1.9days per year, whereas there was a non significant tendency of increase of the leafed period. This means that the leaves stayed active longer. The analysis of CO2 uptake by the forest by use of light response curves, revealed that the maximum rate of photosynthetic assimilation increased by 15% during the 14-year period. We conclude that the increase in the overall CO2 uptake of the forest is due to a combination of increased growing season length and increased uptake capacity. We also conclude that long time series of flux measurements are necessary to reveal trends in the data because of the substantial inter-annual variation in the flux.","Carbon dioxide exchange,Deciduous forest,Trends,Eddy covariance,Multi-years,"
"spectrum sensing for cognitive maritime vhf networks","2014","The Automatic Identification System (AIS) is used worldwide as a maritime system for identifying and locating vessels by exchanging data in Very High Frequency (VHF) band with other nearby ships, AIS base stations and satellites. It is an important system for safety of navigation to assist collision avoidance and enables marine traffic supervision and management. However, the expanding use of AIS band by other emerging applications and services has caused significant increase on the maritime VHF Data Link (VDL) load, hampering smooth exchange of critical AIS information. Instead of assigning new frequency resources for new marine VDL services, in this paper we present a solution to overcome this spectrum scarcity issue by utilizing Cognitive Radio (CR) technology in maritime AIS VHF network. A preliminary analysis of the performance of such an approach is carried out taking into account the different properties and challenges of marine communication channels due to sea surface movement.

"a cnn-lstm network for augmenting target detection in real maritime wide area surveillance radar data","2020","Typical radar detectors exploit only a small proportion of the valuable information contained in radar reflections, i.e. magnitude and Doppler. A neural network-based approach for augmenting traditional radar detector structures using machine learning (ML) is proposed in this paper. Specifically, the network is designed to augment target detection in the field of maritime wide area surveillance for non-coherent data. A combination network consisting of a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract spatial features and a long short-term memory (LSTM) for extracting temporal patterns in the spatial features is proposed. The network augments the detector structure by blanking out regions of the frame which are classified as not containing a target, thus reducing false alarms. The network is tested on data containing four marine targets collected by a ground-based radar. The data set was chosen because it contains strong sea clutter returns. When ML is used, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves are shifted to lower probability of false alarm (PFA). A Kalman filter tracker was applied to the ML-augmented and baseline detections, and it was shown that ML-augmented detections produced similar tracks at lower PFA. The feature discovering capability of the network is analyzed through a series of tests, and the argument is made that the CNN-LSTM network presented in this work demonstrates the ability to improve the detection performance by exploiting spatial and temporal information in the data.","real maritime wide area surveillance radar data,detector structure,Kalman filters,marine radar,baseline detections,radar detection,radar clutter,CNN-LSTM network,Feature extraction,ML-augmented detections,LSTM,target detection augmentation,neural nets,target tracking,short-term memory,wide area surveillance radar,Artificial neural networks,CNN,noncoherent data,maritime surveillance,object detection,feature extraction,combination network,search radar,data set,radar imaging,convolutional neural network,detection performance,ground-based radar,neural network-based approach,radar detectors,radar tracking,radar reflections,temporal information,marine targets,probability,Clutter,Object detection,false alarm,traditional radar detector structures,learning (artificial intelligence),spatial features,Detectors,Radar detection,spatial information,"

"robust infrared maritime target detection based on visual attention and spatiotemporal filtering","2017","It has always been a great challenge to efficiently detect small infrared targets from complex image backgrounds without any prior knowledge. This is especially true when both strong and weak targets appear in the same image or when the weak targets come up on image borders. The main contribution of this paper is to design a robust infrared maritime target detection method, in which a visual attention and pipeline-filtering model is proposed by integrating a revised visual attention model (VAM) and the antivibration pipeline-filtering algorithm. The revised VAM, a single-frame target detection strategy, will first compute a saliency map (SM) from a specific modality, which is automatically selected according to image background smoothness. Then, an automatic strategy for extracting suspected targets from an SM is also proposed here, which highlights targets and suppresses background clutters in SMs through local saliency singularity evaluation. Moreover, contrary to the original VAM, we adopt border saliency preservation in center-surround difference so that robust detection can be guaranteed for targets on image borders. Finally, to eliminate the interference of sea glints and confirm real targets, we adopt the antivibration pipeline-filtering algorithm, a multiframe-based clutter removal method. Compared with the original VAM and two other existing target detection algorithms, experimental results have proven that our strategy can detect infrared maritime targets much better under different environmental conditions.

"ais data-driven ship trajectory prediction modelling and analysis based on machine learning and deep learning methods","2023","Maritime transport faces new safety challenges in an increasingly complex traffic environment caused by large-scale and high-speed ships, particularly with the introduction of intelligent and autonomous ships. It is evident that Automatic Identification System (AIS) data-driven ship trajectory prediction can effectively aid in identifying abnormal ship behaviours and reducing maritime risks such as collision, stranding, and contact. Furthermore, trajectory prediction is widely recognised as one of the critical technologies for realising safe autonomous navigation. The prediction methods and their performance are the key factors for future safe and automatic shipping. Currently, ship trajectory prediction lacks the real performance measurement and analysis of different algorithms, including classical machine learning and emerging deep learning methods. This paper aims to systematically analyse the performance of ship trajectory prediction methods and pioneer experimental tests to reveal their advantages and disadvantages as well as fitness in different scenarios involving complicated systems. To do so, five machine learning methods (i.e., Kalman Filter (KF), Support Vector Progression (SVR), Back Propagation network (BP), Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), and Random Forest (RF)) and seven deep learning methods (i.e., Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gate Recurrent Unit (GRU), Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM), Sequence to Sequence (Seq2seq), Bi-directional Gate Recurrent Unit (Bi-GRU), and Transformer) are first extracted from the state-of-the-art literature review and then employed to implement the trajectory prediction and compare their prediction performance in the real world. Three AIS datasets are collected from the waters of representative traffic features, including a normal channel (i.e., the Chengshan Jiao Promontory), complex traffic (i.e., the Zhoushan Archipelago), and a port area (i.e., Caofeidian port). They are selected to test and analyse the performance of all twelve methods based on six evaluation indexes and explore the characteristics and effectiveness of the twelve trajectory prediction methods in detail. The experimental results provide a novel perspective, comparison, and benchmark for ship trajectory prediction research, which not only demonstrates the fitness of each method in different maritime traffic scenarios, but also makes significant contributions to maritime safety and autonomous shipping development.","Deep learning,Maritime safety,Trajectory prediction,AIS data,Machine learning,"
"a forest geometric description of a maritime pine forest suitable for discrete microwave models","2005","In the microwave region, discrete physical models are often used to simulate surface emission and backscattering of forests.

These allometric equations reproduce the density, shape, and dimension of branches, trunks, and needles, represented by cylinders in the FGD. An original approach to describe the tree architecture is presented: primary branches (branches inserted in the trunk) are split into segments or growth units (GUs) so that the full branch curvature can be accounted for, and probability distribution functions are given for the orientation and diameter of the GUs. The FGD uses only two variables, tree density (number of trees per ha) and tree age, as input information to simulate the forest geometric characteristics at three layers: the upper crown, the lower crown, and a crown-free layer.

Seeing good classification results, in particular by Random Forests, the questions arise whether these at least partly resulted from overfitting phenomena and which of the feature of classification in this problem are most relevant. To address these questions in the current contribution, AIS messages are aggregated per vessel and by the hour by statistical means providing a new AIS feature representation as a basis for classification. By providing a new data representation to the Random Forest classifier, we evaluate classification performance. Then we restrict the presented data to the semantic feature subgroups of the vesselâ€™s positional, course, speed, and dimensions data individually and identify the key features of the classification. The results show that in our exemplary maritime experiments, classification relies mostly on vesselsâ€™ positional and dimensional information.","Semantics,experimental comparison,aggregated messages,Random forests,Surveillance,Classification,Artificial intelligence,key features,Sensitivity,Task analysis,Behavioral sciences,performance evaluation,maritime surveillance systems,AIS,"

"optimizing coastal exhumation strategies: the casework of the committee on missing persons in cyprus (2006–2022)","2023","This paper reports on coastal exhumations performed during 2006–2022, under the framework of the Committee on Missing Persons in Cyprus (CMP) humanitarian identification programme. CMP archaeologists investigated 217 coastal locations and recovered skeletal remains on 44 occasions. Challenging environmental conditions required a customized exhumation plan, which could be executed swiftly without compromising operational integrity or standards. The author performed a retrospective analysis to propose an optimized strategy, which includes a survey, exhumation, digital documentation, and post-processing components, with the aim of minimizing the effects of adverse environmental conditions. The proposed strategy is based on scientific standards and observations in the field; it can satisfy the needs of a humanitarian or criminal investigation if appropriate measures are taken to uphold legislative and forensic standards. The author also discussed the taphonomic effects of coastal erosion and wave activity in tandem with exhumation recommendations to assist forensic practitioners involved in similar investigations.","Aquatic environment,Taphonomy,Clandestine burial,Missing persons,Coastal exhumation,Forensic archaeology,"
"bromine soil/sediment enrichment in tidal salt marshes as a potential indicator of climate changes driven by solar activity: new insights from w coast portuguese estuaries","2017","This paper aims at providing insight about bromine (Br) cycle in four Portuguese estuaries: Minho, Lima (in the NW coast) and Sado, Mira (in the SW coast). The focus is on their tidal marsh environments, quite distinct with regard to key biophysicochemical attributes. Regardless of the primary bromide (Br−) common natural source, i.e., seawater, the NW marshes present relatively higher surface soil/sediment Br concentrations than the ones from SW coast. This happens in close connection with organic matter (OM) content, and is controlled by their main climatic contexts. Yet, the anthropogenic impact on Br concentrations cannot be discarded. Regarding [Br] spatial patterns across the marshes, the results show a general increase from tidal flat toward high marsh. Maxima [Br] occur in the upper driftline zone, at transition from highest low marsh to high marsh, recognized as a privileged setting for OM accumulation. Based on the discovery of OM ubiquitous bromination in marine and transitional environments, it is assumed that this Br occurs mainly as organobromine. Analysis of two dated sediment cores indicates that, despite having the same age (AD ~1300), the Caminha salt marsh (Minho estuary) evidences higher Br enrichment than the Casa Branca salt marsh (Mira estuary). This is related to a greater Br storage ability, which is linked to OM build-up and rate dynamics under different climate scenarios. Both cores evidence a fairly similar temporal Br enrichment pattern, and may be interpreted in light of the sun–climate coupling. Thereby, most of the well-known Grand Solar Minima during the Little Ice Age appear to have left an imprint on these marshes, supported by higher [Br] in soils/sediments. Besides climate changes driven by solar activity and impacting marsh Br biogeodynamics, those Br enrichment peaks might also reflect inputs of enhanced volcanic activity covarying with Grand Solar Minima.","Br cycle,Salt marshes,Grand Solar Minima,OM storage,Climate variability,Climate modelling,"

"development of a time series imaging approach for fault classification of marine systems","2022","As part of any Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) system for the shipping industry, the determination of the current health of marine systems is fundamental. As such, diagnostic analytics is performed; a process that is typically constituted by fault detection, fault isolation, and fault identification. Although some efforts have been made to distinguish the faults and malfunctions (fault detection) that can occur in marine systems, the implementation of fault identification to provide a description of any considered fault type and its nature is still an unexplored area due to the lack of fault data. To overcome this, a methodology for the identification of anomalies in marine systems is presented in this paper. The proposed approach aims to analyse the implementation of time series imaging through the application of the first-order Markov chain in tandem with an analysis of both ResNet50V2 and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) as part of the image classification task. To highlight the performance of this methodology, anomalies have been simulated considering the power parameter of a diesel generator. Results demonstrated the potential of time series imaging and image classification approaches, as the Markov-CNN achieved an accuracy of 95% when performing the fault classification task.","Anomaly identification,Time series imaging,Marine systems,Fault diagnosis,Prognostics and health management (PHM),Fault classification,Shipping industry,"
"early anomaly detection in smart home: a causal association rule-based approach","2018","As the world's population grows older, an increasing number of people are facing health issues. For the elderly, living alone can be difficult and dangerous. Consequently, smart homes are becoming increasingly popular. A sensor-rich environment can be exploited for healthcare applications, in particular, anomaly detection (AD). The literature review for this paper showed that few works consider environmental factors to detect anomalies. Instead, the focus is on user activity and checking whether it is abnormal, i.e., does not conform to expected behavior. Furthermore, reducing the number of anomalies using early detection is a major issue in many applications. In this context, anomaly-cause discovery may be helpful in recommending actions that may prevent risk. In this paper, we present a novel approach for detecting the risk of anomalies occurring in the environment regarding user activities. The method relies on anomaly-cause extraction from a given dataset using causal association rules mining. These anomaly causes are utilized afterward for real-time analysis to detect the risk of anomalies using the Markov logic network machine learning method. The detected risk allows the method to recommend suitable actions to perform in order to avoid the occurrence of an actual anomaly. The proposed approach is implemented, tested, and evaluated for each contribution using real data obtained from an intelligent environment platform and real data from a clinical datasets. Experimental results prove our approach to be efficient in terms of recognition rate.","Anomaly detection,Markov logic network,Smart homes,Causal association rules,"
"metallogenic domains and their reflection in regional lake sediment surveys from the meguma zone, southern nova scotia, canada","1990","Approximately 3000 samples from a regional centre-lake bottom sediment survey of southern Nova Scotia were re-analyzed for sixteen elements of metallogenic significance. Analytical results for Cu, Pb, Zn, Ag, Li, F, Nb, Sn, Ti, Zr, Rb, Th, Sb, As, W and Au confirm that most known mineral deposits and metallogenic domains in the Meguma Zone have detectable geochemical signatures in lake sediments. Lake sediment exploration is most effective for mapping when a catchment basin model is employed. In southern Nova Scotia, lake sediment surveys are especially useful when prospecting and selecting areas of potential lithophile mineralization. Mineralogical expressions of Sn, W, Th and Zr in lake sediment are reflected by the presence of discrete grains of cassiterite, scheelite or wolframite, monazite and zircon. Free gold has also been identified in lake sediment, and may be the cause of some identified Au anomalies. Lake catchment basins contain mixtures of hydromorphically and mechanically dispersed components. After relatively short transport distances from a bedrock or till source heavy minerals can be trapped in lake catchment basins. Meguma Zone lake sediment anomalies may be grouped into those dominated by these hydromorphic and mechanical-weathering processes. Geochemical mapping using lake sediments is undertaken through the application of simple data reduction procedures using single- and multi-element methods. Geochemical maps for individual elements are produced as computer-contoured colour plots at a fixed percentile scale. Maps for Sn, W, Au and Ag outline known mineral occurrences as distinct anomalies for the East Kemptville Sn-Zn-Cu ± W, Millet Brook U-Cu-Ag and numerous Au vein deposits within defined bedrock metallogenic domains. Geochemical mapping of Au and Ag anomalies also indicates large-scale structures such as northwesterly trending shear zones. Large shear zones are outlined by Au anomalies, and W highs define areas of new potential in exo-contact zones of the South Mountain Batholith. Gold potential for granitoid rocks is indicated by numerous Au anomalies. Associations of Cu-Pb-Zn-Ag, F-Li-Nb-Rb + Sn, Zr-Ti-Th and Sb-As-Au-W are plotted with multi-element score maps. Boundaries of the score maps closely follow the bedrock metallogenic domains and outline areas of potential economic mineralization. Regional geochemical mapping can be accomplished successfully, accurately and at reasonable cost using lake sediments. Modern analytical packages offer high-precision techniques for lake sediment analysis. Compared to regional till surveys in this area, lake sediment surveys cost less and have spatial attributes that produce data more suited to geochemical mapping projects.",""
"submarine groundwater discharge detection through remote sensing: an application of landsat 7 and 8 in hawaiʻi and ireland","2022","Submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) represents an important component of the global water cycle. Improved assessment of SGD occurrences provides information to constrain current estimates of total freshwater discharges, which are crucial for evaluation of changes in the global water cycle. This study leverages SGD linkages to patterns in sea surface temperature (SST) and color. Typically, groundwater temperatures exhibit less variability than SST and tend to have temperature distinct from sea water. Consequently, thermally anomalous plumes often occur in coastal areas with SGD. Nutrient-enriched groundwater flows have been linked to changes in ocean color as a consequence of algae growth and of the presence of colored dissolved organic matter. Under such conditions, SGD presence may also manifest as plumes of different colors. Changes in SST and color can be captured through satellite imagery for the thermal infrared and visible bands, which are used here to detect potential SGD (PSGD) occurrences. A method based on clustering and spectroscopy techniques is applied to automatically detect PSGD plumes. SST data are clustered to map SST anomalies. Derivative analysis and angular distance are applied to identify a color signature linked to SGD. In a novel approach, SST and color are combined to identify PSGD through remote sensing. The methods presented in this study were applied to Landsat 7 and 8 imagery captured over southern Ireland and the west coast of the Island of Hawaiʻi, where past field surveys of radon isotopes activities and salinity have documented SGD occurrences. These selected sites are used as validation points. Derivative analysis and angular distance resulted in PSGD plumes in the vicinity of sampled locations, mainly locations with samples that are strong indicators of SGD. In general, the PSGD plumes derived from each method are compared as independent, parallel lines of evidence of PSGD occurrences. Results also show that PSGD pixels from derivative analysis and angular distance alone, without considering SST, can be obfuscated by confounding factors, such as low tides and unrelated chlorophyll enrichment, and that combining SST and color data reduces those effects. These results provide further evidence for PSGD occurrences along the south coast of Ireland and the west coast of the Island of Hawaiʻi, and showcase that satellite data can be used to better identify the location of PSGD occurrences over large areas.","Coastal waters,Submarine groundwater discharge,Ocean color,Sea surface temperature,"
"similarity grouping-guided neural network modeling for maritime time series prediction","2019","Reliable and accurate prediction of time series plays a crucial role in the maritime industry, such as economic investment, transportation planning, port planning, design, and so on. The dynamic growth of maritime time series has the predominantly complex, and nonlinear and non-stationary properties. To guarantee high-quality prediction performance, we propose to first adopt the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and ensemble EMD (EEMD) methods to decompose the original time series into high- and low-frequency components. The low-frequency components can be easily predicted directly through traditional neural network (NN) methods. It is more difficult to predict high-frequency components due to their properties of weak mathematical regularity. To take advantage of the inherent self-similarities within high-frequency components, these components will be divided into several continuous small (overlapping) segments. The grouped segments with high similarities are then selected to form more proper training datasets for traditional NN methods. This regrouping strategy can assist in enhancing the prediction accuracy of high-frequency components. The final prediction result is obtained by integrating the predicted high- and low-frequency components. Our proposed three-step prediction frameworks benefit from the time series decomposition and similar segments grouping. The experiments on both port cargo throughput and vessel traffic flow have illustrated its superior performance in terms of prediction accuracy and robustness.","predicted high- frequency components,Transportation,Data prediction,time series decomposition,high-frequency components,nonstationary properties,Planning,reliable prediction,Predictive models,original time series,dynamic time warping (DTW),neural nets,low-frequency components,high-quality prediction performance,marine engineering,Artificial neural networks,similar segments grouping,Time series analysis,similarity grouping,similarity grouping-guided neural network modeling,three-step prediction frameworks,empirical mode decomposition (EMD),time series,Training,prediction accuracy,NN methods,maritime industry,maritime time series prediction,neural network,neural network methods,EMD methods,"

"reliability of multi-purpose offshore-facilities: present status and future direction in australia","2021","Sustainable use of the ocean for food and energy production is an emerging area of research in different countries around the world. This goal is pursued by the Australian aquaculture, offshore engineering and renewable energy industries, research organisations and the government through the “Blue Economy Cooperative Research Centre”. To address the challenges of offshore food and energy production, leveraging the benefits of co-location, vertical integration, infrastructure and shared services, will be enabled through the development of novel Multi-Purpose Offshore-Platforms (MPOP). The structural integrity of the designed systems when being deployed in the harsh offshore environment is one of the main challenges in developing the MPOPs. Employing structural reliability analysis methods for assessing the structural safety of the novel aquaculture-MPOPs comes with different limitations. This review aims at shedding light on these limitations and discusses the current status and future directions for structural reliability analysis of a novel aquaculture-MPOP considering Australia’s unique environment. To achieve this aim, challenges which exist at different stages of reliability assessment, from data collection and uncertainty quantification to load and structural modelling and reliability analysis implementation, are discussed. Furthermore, several solutions to these challenges are proposed based on the existing knowledge in other sectors, and particularly from the offshore oil and gas industry.

"mid- to late-holocene australian–indonesian summer monsoon variability","2014","The Australian–Indonesian monsoon has a governing influence on the agricultural practices and livelihood in the highly populated islands of Indonesia. However, little is known about the factors that have influenced past monsoon activity in southern Indonesia. Here, we present a ∼6000 years high-resolution record of Australian-Indonesian summer monsoon (AISM) rainfall variations based on bulk sediment element analysis in a sediment archive retrieved offshore northwest Sumba Island (Indonesia). The record suggests lower riverine detrital supply and hence weaker AISM rainfall between 6000 yr BP and ∼3000 yr BP compared to the Late Holocene. We find a distinct shift in terrigenous sediment supply at around 2800 yr BP indicating a reorganization of the AISM from a drier Mid Holocene to a wetter Late Holocene in southern Indonesia. The abrupt increase in rainfall at around 2800 yr BP coincides with a grand solar minimum. An increase in southern Indonesian rainfall in response to a solar minimum is consistent with climate model simulations that provide a possible explanation of the underlying mechanism responsible for the monsoonal shift. We conclude that variations in solar activity play a significant role in monsoonal rainfall variability at multi-decadal and longer timescales. The combined effect of orbital and solar forcing explains important details in the temporal evolution of AISM rainfall during the last 6000 years. By contrast, we find neither evidence for volcanic forcing of AISM variability nor for a control by long-term variations in the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO).","Solar forcing,Orbital forcing,Australian–Indonesian summer monsoon,Grand solar minimum,Holocene,"
"federated deep learning for smart city edge-based applications","2023","The growing quantities of data allow for advanced analysis. A prime example of it are smart city applications with forecasting urban traffic flow as a key application. However, data privacy becomes a real issue.

The road network is first pre-processed to eliminate the noise from the traffic data. Next, detecting anomalous features is performed to prune irrelevant edges and patterns. The generated graph is then utilized to learn a graph convolutional neural network for calculating the future city’s traffic flow. We extensive evaluate our federated learning-based framework, where a case study on predicting the future traffic flows has been carried out using multiple datasets. We examine it with different baseline techniques as well. The findings show that the suggested framework greatly outperforms the baseline methods, particularly when the graph has a lot of nodes. Importantly, our approach is the first one that integrates trusted authority principle in federated learning and, by doing so, it is able to efficiently secure model data.

"modeling an incident management team as a joint cognitive system","2018","Resilience is considered an essential capability of an Incident Management Team (IMT) in planning for and responding to disasters and catastrophes. While IMTs have been studied as a decision-making unit, few attempts were made to view them from a Joint Cognitive System (JCS) perspective that highlights the interplay among humans and technical agents and demands imposed by the incident. To that end, this paper presents a JCS model of the IMT grounded in findings from the existing literature and naturalistic observations of simulated IMT's incident action planning, which functions in a cyclic manner across multiple scales. Using this model, three measures for resilience of the IMT, recovery time, resource status, and interactions, are discussed. To effectively represent the resilient performance incorporating these measures, a novel adoption of the Interactive Episode Analysis method is utilized. By providing a few examples of the analysis method, this study provides proof-of-concept for objective assessment of the resilience characteristics of the IMT.

"background modeling combined with multiple features in the fourier domain for maritime infrared target detection","2022","To detect ship targets in dynamic sea backgrounds, a robust foreground detection method based on background modeling combined with multiple features in the Fourier domain (BMMFF) is proposed. Because the fluctuation of seawater is similar to a sine wave, the amplitude spectrum of the seawater in the Fourier domain has strong energy concentration, and the background model is built in the Fourier domain. The local statistical characteristics can effectively reflect the properties of a specific position, and the target frequency points are extracted by comparing the local statistical characteristic differences between the amplitude spectrum of the test frame and the updated background. Additionally, two different strategies are used to update the background for cases with or without sudden waves in two adjacent test frames. When the target and seawater have different contrast in different scenes, the threshold is set according to the seawaterâ€™s fluctuation degree, which is classified into three different levels in the training stage. Moreover, the linear correlation feature between the test frame and the updated background and the oscillation feature of the test frameâ€™s amplitude spectrum are proposed in the Fourier domain, which can better segment targets in relatively calm and violent sea scenes, respectively. Thus, the two features are combined with the background model with a reasonable strategy to further improve the detection accuracy. The experimental results demonstrate that BMMFF outperforms related comparison algorithms in different challenging sea scenes. The average false alarm rate of BMMFF is reduced by approximately 30% in the case where its average detection rate is similar to that of other algorithms.","target frequency points,linear correlation feature,Marine vehicles,Feature extraction,seawater,sea scenes,statistical analysis,dynamic sea backgrounds,ships,marine engineering,background modeling,object detection,ship targets,Oscillators,feature extraction,Correlation,Adaptation models,foreground detection method,infrared imaging,Dual-mode sea background model,local statistical characteristic differences,Object detection,image segmentation,Data mining,oscillation feature,Fourier domain,maritime infrared target detection,"

"an intelligent decision algorithm for the generation of maritime search and rescue emergency response plans","2019","Maritime search and rescue (SAR) decisions are the most important part of maritime SAR operations. In the process of making maritime SAR decisions, a key factor affecting efficiency and success rate is how to quickly respond to accidents and develop an emergency response plan. At present, maritime SAR emergency response plans are still mostly obtained through a combination of drift prediction models and SAR experience. There is a lack of SAR resource scheduling and SAR task assignment. The primary purpose of this paper is to explore the possibility of using an intelligent decision-making algorithm to formulate maritime SAR emergency response plans so as to produce results more scientifically. First, the relevant research areas and research data are briefly introduced, and the main mathematical models involved in the optimal search theory are expounded. Next, key technologies involved in the process of maritime SAR emergency response plan generation, including the determination of search area, the scheduling of SAR resources, the allocation of search tasks, and the planning of search routes, are analyzed in detail. Two optimization model algorithms, namely the SAR resource scheduling model based on genetic simulated annealing algorithm (GSAA) and the regional task allocation algorithm based on space-time characteristics, are proposed as approaches to solving the problem of resource scheduling and task allocation. Finally, the effectiveness and optimization of the proposed algorithms are verified by analyzing the emergency response of a real case which occurred in the Bohai Sea and comparing the different schemes.

Geomorphological and meteorological influences on ground surface temperature anomaly, hoarfrost, air ventilation funnels and snow melt windows, were analyzed as well as locations of long-lying snow and permafrost patches. The results show that debris slope ventilation is a common phenomenon occurring in different periods of the year. Its range is influenced mainly by substratum porosity (ground and snow cover), and the difference between the pressure inside and outside this medium (pore and atmospheric air temperature/dense; wind velocity). The height of the slope (‘chimney’) is less important. Some phenomena assumed to be evidences of slope ventilation are often connected with other factors influencing the thermal balance of the ground and the size of snow accumulation.","Tatra Mountains,Ground temperature,Debris slopes,Sporadic permafrost,Mountain environment,Air circulation,"

"a sensitivity quantification approach to significance analysis of thrusters in dynamic positioning operations","2021","The safety of offshore operations is highly dependent on the dynamic positioning (DP) capability of a vessel. Meanwhile, DP capability comes down to the ability of the thrust generated by thrusters to counteract environmental forces. Therefore, it is significant to investigate which thrusters are important to the position-keeping ability of vessels. However, complex environmental factors make the investigation of thrusters' importance more complicated. Hence, this paper proposes a new method to identify the influence of each thruster on vessel's station-keeping capability in different sea states. The station-keeping capability is quantified by a defined synthesized positioning ability criterion comprised by vessel position, heading angle, and consumed power. Through the comparison of different machine learning approaches, support vector machine (SVM) is used for building a surrogate model between DP capability and thrusters. In order to determine the most sensitive thruster in the whole process of vessel operation, an improved sensitivity analysis (SA) called ‘PAWN’ is employed along with statistical analysis to evaluate the significance of thrusters from different perspectives. Seventeen cases are investigated with respect to different thruster failures in various sea states. The results show the proposed method is able to identify the significance of each thruster in different scenarios.","Statistical analysis,Sensitivity analysis,Dynamic positioning capability,Thruster failures,"

"greenhouse gas emissions from marine decommissioned hydrocarbon wells: leakage detection, monitoring and mitigation strategies","2020","Hydrocarbon gas emissions from with decommissioned wells are an underreported source of greenhouse gas emissions in oil and gas provinces. The associated emissions may partly counteract efforts to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel infrastructure. We have developed an approach for assessing methane leakage from marine decommissioned wells based on a combination of existing regional industrial seismic and newly acquired hydroacoustic water column imaging data from the Central North Sea. Here, we present hydroacoustic data which show that 28 out of 43 investigated wells release gas from the seafloor into the water column. This gas release largely depends on the presence of shallow gas accumulations and their distance to the wells. The released gas is likely primarily biogenic methane from shallow sources. In the upper 1,000 m below the seabed, gas migration is likely focused along drilling-induced fractures around the borehole or through non-sealing barriers. Combining available direct measurements for methane release from marine decommissioned wells with our leakage analysis suggests that gas release from investigated decommissioned hydrocarbon wells is a major source of methane in the North Sea (0.9-3.7 [95% confidence interval = 0.7-4.2] kt yr−1 of CH4 for 1,792 wells in the UK sector of the Central North Sea). This means hydrocarbon gas emissions associated with marine hydrocarbon wells are not significant for the global greenhouse gas budget, but have to be considered when compiling regional methane budgets.","methane quantification,well integrity,Central North Sea,Methane leakage,Seismic data,decommissioned wells,Water column imaging data,"
"hierarchical level fault detection and diagnosis of ship engine systems","2023","As smart ships are developed, research into engine management through remote monitoring and support from data collected at onshore control centers is being conducted. However, ship engine data collected from various sensors have high dimensions, large measurement errors, few labeled data, and insufficient amounts and quality of data, making it difficult to determine the condition of engines with complex failure modes under various operating environments.This study proposes a hierarchical level fault detection and diagnosis (HL-FDD) method that combines domain knowledge of ship engines and advanced data analysis techniques. The developed method extracts key features of reduced dimensions from the original variables (sensors) through an optimal hierarchical clustering and dimension-reduction model, allowing a hierarchy divided into the top (the entire system combining all features), middle (subsystems and feature sets), and bottom (components and sensors) levels. The reduced key features are used to generate robust regression models and dynamic thresholds (prediction intervals) according to the engine load, and dynamic thresholds determine whether the engine’s condition is normal or abnormal. The dynamic thresholds are able to automatically label abnormal conditions of the engine. Once anomalies are detected at the top level, the proposed method can sequentially search for data on features belonging to the middle and bottom hierarchies for detailed fault diagnosis to determine which engine subsystem or component(s) caused the engine fault(s). Actual data collected by ship operators verify the proposed method’s efficiency, reliability, and accuracy.","Optimal hierarchical clustering and dimension reduction,Domain knowledge,Sensor error,Dynamic thresholds,Abnormality labeling,Duel fuel marine engine,"
"enhanced maritime spatial planning through vts","2018","Maritime Spatial Planning has become an essential requirement in order to ensure and contribute to the protection of the marine environment. The challenge is to regulate economic interests by simultaneously ensuring appropriate levels of safety for the various off-shore activities in coastal and open sea areas like fish farming, establishing operating wind farms and other activities mainly focusing on avoiding any limitations to safe and efficient vessel traffic flows from and to ports. International and national rules and regulations, recommendations and guidelines and other legal and administrative measures have been developed, established and set into force to avoid uncoordinated actions and activities. Even though the procedures and processes for spatial planning in the maritime domain has successively been improved there seems to be still potentials for optimization of the planning. As a hypothesis, those potentials are expected by extending and improving the data basis used for the description of the current and the forecasting of the potential future situation in respect of the environment and the traffic activities. This paper presents interim results of an ongoing study specifically focusing on available traffic and environmental data and on the use of available guidelines and data sources for potential improvement of the planning processes.

"suitability analysis and revised strategies for marine environmental carbon capture and storage (ccs) monitoring","2021","Environmental monitoring of offshore Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) complexes requires robust methodologies and cost-effective tools to detect, attribute and quantify CO2 leakage in the unlikely event it occurs from a sub-seafloor reservoir. Various approaches can be utilised for environmental CCS monitoring, but their capabilities are often undemonstrated and more detailed monitoring strategies need to be developed. We tested and compared different approaches in an offshore setting using a CO2 release experiment conducted at 120 m water depth in the Central North Sea. Tests were carried out over a range of CO2 injection rates (6 - 143 kg d−1) comparable to emission rates observed from abandoned wells. Here, we discuss the benefits and challenges of the tested approaches and compare their relative cost, temporal and spatial resolution, technology readiness level and sensitivity to leakage. The individual approaches demonstrate a high level of sensitivity and certainty and cover a wide range of operational requirements. Additionally, we refer to a set of generic requirements for site-specific baseline surveys that will aid in the interpretation of the results. Critically, we show that the capability of most techniques to detect and quantify leakage exceeds the currently existing legal requirements.","Monitoring strategy,Leakage detection,Leakage quantification,CCS monitoring,Leakage attribution,Suitability analysis,"
"global navigation satellite systems performance analysis and augmentation strategies in aviation","2017","In an era of significant air traffic expansion characterized by a rising congestion of the radiofrequency spectrum and a widespread introduction of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are being exposed to a variety of threats including signal interferences, adverse propagation effects and challenging platform-satellite relative dynamics. Thus, there is a need to characterize GNSS signal degradations and assess the effects of interfering sources on the performance of avionics GNSS receivers and augmentation systems used for an increasing number of mission-essential and safety-critical aviation tasks (e.g., experimental flight testing, flight inspection/certification of ground-based radio navigation aids, wide area navigation and precision approach). GNSS signal deteriorations typically occur due to antenna obscuration caused by natural and man-made obstructions present in the environment (e.g., elevated terrain and tall buildings when flying at low altitude) or by the aircraft itself during manoeuvring (e.g., aircraft wings and empennage masking the on-board GNSS antenna), ionospheric scintillation, Doppler shift, multipath, jamming and spurious satellite transmissions. Anyone of these phenomena can result in partial to total loss of tracking and possible tracking errors, depending on the severity of the effect and the receiver characteristics. After designing GNSS performance threats, the various augmentation strategies adopted in the Communication, Navigation, Surveillance/Air Traffic Management and Avionics (CNS + A) context are addressed in detail. GNSS augmentation can take many forms but all strategies share the same fundamental principle of providing supplementary information whose objective is improving the performance and/or trustworthiness of the system. Hence it is of paramount importance to consider the synergies offered by different augmentation strategies including Space Based Augmentation System (SBAS), Ground Based Augmentation System (GBAS), Aircraft Based Augmentation System (ABAS) and Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM). Furthermore, by employing multi-GNSS constellations and multi-sensor data fusion techniques, improvements in availability and continuity can be obtained. SBAS is designed to improve GNSS system integrity and accuracy for aircraft navigation and landing, while an alternative approach to GNSS augmentation is to transmit integrity and differential correction messages from ground-based augmentation systems (GBAS). In addition to existing space and ground based augmentation systems, GNSS augmentation may take the form of additional information being provided by other on-board avionics systems, such as in ABAS. As these on-board systems normally operate via separate principles than GNSS, they are not subject to the same sources of error or interference. Using suitable data link and data processing technologies on the ground, a certified ABAS capability could be a core element of a future GNSS Space-Ground-Aircraft Augmentation Network (SGAAN). Although current augmentation systems can provide significant improvement of GNSS navigation performance, a properly designed and flight-certified SGAAN could play a key role in trusted autonomous system and cyber-physical system applications such as UAS Sense-and-Avoid (SAA).","Differential GNSS,High-integrity systems,Aerospace electronic systems,Air navigation,Avionics,Integrity monitoring,GNSS augmentation,Cyber-physical systems,Ground based augmentation system,Receiver autonomous integrity monitoring,Safety-critical aviation applications,Aircraft based augmentation system,Aviation security,GNSS performance,Global navigation satellite system,Satellite based augmentation system,"
"assortative analysis of bulk trade complex network on maritime silk road","2020","Assortativity, one of the mixing patterns of complex networks, is characterized by measuring whether the nodes are preferentially connected to the nodes with a similar scale. While numerous studies have examined the assortative characteristics of various real-world networks, few studies have attempted to analyze the assortativity of networks in which the subject of trade is bulk. The novelty of this research is that, for the first time, the assortative coefficient method in physics is introduced into the bulk trade network, and the Automatic Identification System (AIS) data is used to explore the assortative mixing characteristics of the network. From the perspective of multi-scale (port and country) and multi-dimensional (node, link, and network) structure, this paper reveals the tendency of trade connection and explores the trade rules of bulk in networks. The results show that: (1) The trade network of bulk on the Maritime Silk Road is assortative. With the increase of spatial scale, the extent of assortativity is also gradually increasing; (2) In the bulk network of ports, trade cooperation shows the rule of distance attenuation; In the national bulk network, it shows the rule of preferential connection; (3) Ports with high out-degree will export bulk to the ports with high out-degree with broad market, while countries with high out-degree export to high in-degree countries with strong demand. The present study is expected to provide valuable references for port planning, national formulation of scientific bulk trade strategy, and promotion of coordinated development of bulk trade network along the Maritime Silk Road.","international trade,assortativity,assortative mixing characteristics,automatic identification system data,Marine vehicles,macroeconomics,assortative coefficient method,bulk trade complex network,Maritime Silk Road,multidimensional structure,trade network,bulk,Oils,Containers,trade cooperation,AIS,port planning,Correlation,Artificial intelligence,sea ports,Roads,multiscale structure,complex networks,maritime silk road,"

"forecasting the impact of an 1859-calibre superstorm on satellite resources","2006","We have developed simple models to assess the economic impacts to the current satellite resource caused by the worst-case scenario of a hypothetical superstorm event occurring during the next sunspot cycle. Although the consequences may be severe, our worse-case scenario does not include the complete failure of the entire 937 operating satellites in the current population, which have a replacement value of ∼$170–230 billion, and supporting a ∼$90 billion/year industry. Our estimates suggest a potential economic loss of <$70 billion for lost revenue (∼$44 billion) and satellite replacement for GEO satellites (∼$24 billion) caused by a ‘once a century’ single storm similar to the 1859 superstorm. We estimate that 80 satellites (LEO, MEO, and GEO) may be disabled as a consequence of a superstorm event. Additional impacts may include the failure of many of the GPS, GLONASS, and Galileo satellite systems in MEO. Approximately 97 LEO satellites, which normally would not have re-entered for many decades, may prematurely de-orbit by ca 2021 as a result of the temporarily increased atmospheric drag caused by a superstorm event occurring in ca. 2012. The $100 billion International Space Station may lose significant altitude, placing it in critical need for re-boosting by an amount potentially outside the range of typical Space Shuttle operations, which are in any case scheduled to end in 2010. Currently, the ability to forecast extreme particle events and coronal mass ejections, or predict their fluences and geoseverity in the 24-h prior to the event, appears to be no better than 50/50. Our analysis of economic impacts is a first attempt at estimation whose approach will suggest ways in which better estimates may eventually be obtained.","Satellite anomalies,Radiation sickness,Technology impacts,Satellite failures,Space weather,Superstorms,Economic impacts,"

"maritime cybersecurity and the imo legal instruments: sluggish response to an escalating threat?","2022","Maritime cybersecurity threats are sharply growing. The safety and security of ports, ships, and offshore installations are increasingly threatened due to cyberattacks from numerous sources. With the increasing digitalization of the maritime sector during the global pandemic, the number of cyberattacks on the maritime industry exponentially intensified recently. Against this backdrop, this article critically analyses the existing IMO legal instruments to identify the scope for further development. This study is based on a doctrinal analysis of recent legal and technical literature and the relevant IMO legal instruments and documents. It aims to contribute to a better understanding of the IMO regulations for ensuring maritime cybersecurity. Although the IMO adopted some legal and policy instruments for maritime cybersecurity, the current international legal framework is inadequate for effectively dealing with maritime cybersecurity threats. This article argues that further initiative may be taken for an effective international legal reform through multidimensional cooperation involving State and non-state actors.","Cyber-attacks,International Maritime Organization (IMO),Cybersecurity,Ships,Ports,International law,Offshore installations,"
"hts coils optimization for application in a linear generator for maritime applications","2019","Motors or linear generators have traditionally been built with winding layers and with an equal number of turns in each said layer; generally, the level of energy per layer and the voltage generated in each of them decreases as the magnetic field decreases.

This paper describes a criterion for the optimization of linear electric generator windings made with BSCCO 2223 high temperature superconducting tapes. The optimization is done requiring that the generated voltage level be uniform across the layers, and magnetic energy not changed considering the total energy in coil and taking into account the characteristics of the superconducting materials.

Concentrations of Pb, Zn, Mn, Mo, Fe, Ti, Al, Ca and Mg in these samples were determined by emission spectroscopy analysis. The measurements also included several meteorological parameters. The results show that midlake concentrations are a strong function of temperature stability and linearly independent of wind speed in the lowest few meters above the lake's surface. There is also a strong dependence upon nearshore source regions. It is estimated that over 95% of the Pb, 75% of the Zn and Mn and more than half of the Fe midlake atmospheric concentrations are anthropogenic in origin and that fine particulates with high Pb, Zn and Mn content control the variability in midlake mass concentration.",""
"the groundwater potential assessment system based on cloud computing: a case study in islands region","2021","Today’s intelligent system based on cloud computing platform can realize “unattended”, real-time monitoring observation and forecast by remote sensing. In order to import the development and efficiency of groundwater potential assessment(GPA) by remote sensing, the cloud computing platform was tried to use in the computing GPA.

"a generic anomaly detection approach applied to mixture-of-unigrams and maritime surveillance data","2019","This paper proposes a new generic method to detect anomalies (i.e., statistical outliers) which can be used with a generative topic model. In this paper, we specify this method in the context of the Mixture-of-unigrams model, which is widely used in text mining. It is possible to detect anomalies with a topic model by applying a threshold to the likelihood. However, it is challenging to choose the threshold since the choice needs to consider both the similarities of the topics and the length of documents. This paper describes a new intuitive method to detect anomalies which simply manipulates the output of the trained model. Such an approach is anticipated to have parameters that are more intuitive to define for a given problem. To assess the utility of the proposed approach, we also present a use case involving identifying ships misreporting their ship-type using geo-location data from the Automatic Identification System (AIS) messages.

"role of rainfall intensity and urban sprawl in the 2014 flash flood in genoa city, bisagno catchment (liguria, italy)","2018","Flash floods are typical for the Mediterranean region, however they have been recurring at increasing frequency over the past few decades especially over the Italian Peninsula. The region of Genoa has recently moved into the international spotlight due to frequent and disastrous flash floods of the Bisagno River and its tributaries as a result of intense autumn rainfall and dense floodplain urbanization. The last flood events even caused loss in human lives, with 6 casualties in 2011 and 1 in 2014. However, it has not yet been investigated whether the increase in these flash flood events is due to a change in rainfall regime or due to urban expansion in areas prone to flash floods. This study investigates the meteorological conditions and the ground effects of the Bisagno River flash flood of October 9th, 2014 in the city of Genoa. Application of a Standard Anomaly Index and a Cluster Analysis reveals a positive trend in intense and short-duration rainfall recorded in the Bisagno Valley for the period of 1945–2016. Urban sprawl in the catchment, assessed through a multi-temporal cartographic and photographic comparison, highlights the progressive and total consumption of land in the floodplain. In the river basin surrounding Genoa the risk of flash floods has increased, both due to a change in rainfall regime and associated increase in discharge but also due to increased vulnerability caused by progressive urban expansion and land use change, including in particular transformations of the Bisagno riverbed. The results obtained demonstrate the need for urgent action to mitigate flood risk by introducing, amongst other measures, a citizen observatory for early warning of flash floods.","Urban sprawl,Italy,Flash flood risk,Rainfall regime variations,Mediterranean area,Genoa,"
"an integrated maritime reasoning and monitoring system","2012","Maritime information systems typically offer system features for data collection, information fusion and the automated construction of a basic recognized maritime picture for human operators. However making sense of maritime situations is still very much an intensive human-based cognitive endeavor. Limited human resources face difficult cognitive challenges in making sense of huge amount of data generated daily by dynamic round-the-clock maritime shipping and port activities. An effective information exploitation system for maritime surveillance and monitoring is expected to be able to augment human-based surveillance and monitoring operations with machine-based computing capabilities to interpret and reason about massive amount of situational information, as well as transforming this knowledge into actionable decision indicators for the human decision makers. The Defence Science & Technology Agency (DSTA) has developed the PACKED model to guide the exploration and development of computing technologies that support human decision making and other cognitive challenges in information rich, complex, and dynamic operational environments. An integrated maritime reasoning and monitoring system illustrates how computing technologies are applied in the areas of Attention, Knowledge, and Comprehension to support situation analysis and monitoring processes for maritime surveillance. The maritime reasoning and monitoring system consist of Bayesian reasoning, entity network analysis, and movement pattern analysis, to integrate, analyze, interpret and reason about maritime data.

"small maritime target detection using gradient vector field characterization of infrared image","2023","Infrared small maritime target detection under strong ocean waves, a challenging task, plays a key role in maritime distress target search and rescue applications. Many methods based on directionality or gradient properties have proven to perform well for infrared images with heterogeneous scenarios. However, they tend to perform poorly when facing strong ocean wave background, mainly due to the following: 1) infrared images have low signal-to-clutter ratio with low intensity for small targets; 2) some waves have high local contrast that may be similar to or higher than targets. To solve these issues, a new method based on gradient vector field characterization (GVFC) of infrared images is proposed. First, we construct the gradient vector field and coarsely extract suspected targets. Then, gradient vector distribution measure (GVDM) is presented, which comprehensively integrates a synergistic homogeneity test based on Kolmogorovâ€“Smirnov test with absolute difference standard deviation for gradient direction angle and regression analysis for gradient modulus. The proposed GVDM takes advantage of pixel-level gradient distribution property to further filtrate refined suspected targets. Moreover, gradient modulus horizontal local dissimilarity is proposed to measure the diversity of gradient modulus in horizontal direction between targets and waves, so as to enhance target saliency and suppress residual clutter simultaneously, which achieves preferable performance. Finally, a simple adaptive threshold is applied to confirm targets. Extensive experiments implemented on infrared maritime images with strong ocean waves demonstrate that the proposed method is superior to the state-of-the-art methods with respect to robustness and detection accuracy.","gradient vector distribution measure,pixel-level gradient distribution property,rescue applications,maritime target detection,radar clutter,strong ocean wave background,strong ocean waves,infrared maritime image,Sea measurements,gradient direction angle,regression analysis,gradient vector field characterization,Ocean waves,ocean waves,Target tracking,object detection,Sparse matrices,feature extraction,target saliency,small target detection,infrared image,suppress residual clutter,infrared maritime images,suspected targets,infrared imaging,maritime distress target search,Tensors,Clutter,Object detection,gradient modulus horizontal local dissimilarity,low signal-to-clutter ratio,vertical local dissimilarity,image segmentation,Gradient vector,"
"double-constrained rpca based on saliency maps for foreground detection in automated maritime surveillance","2015","The development of automated video-surveillance applications for maritime environment is a very difficult task due to the complexity of the scenes: moving water, waves, etc. The motion of the objects of interest (i.e. ships or boats) can be mixed with the dynamic behavior of the background (non-regular patterns). In this paper, a double-constrained Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA), named SCM-RPCA (Shape and Confidence Map-based RPCA), is proposed to improve the object foreground detection in maritime scenes. The sparse component is constrained by shape and confidence maps both extracted from spatial saliency maps. The experimental results in the UCSD and MarDT data sets indicate a better enhancement of the object foreground mask when compared with some related RPCA methods.","Optical imaging,automated video surveillance application,image enhancement,Matrix decomposition,MarDT data set,Noise,object detection,Shape,Sparse matrices,shape and confidence map based RPCA,saliency map,double-constrained robust principal component analysis,foreground detection,UCSD data set,objectforeground detection,Boats,Minimization,double-constrained RPCA,SCM-RPCA,object foreground enhancement,principal component analysis,video surveillance,"
"remote sensing annual dynamics of rapid permafrost thaw disturbances with landtrendr","2022","Permafrost is warming globally which leads to widespread permafrost thaw. Particularly ice-rich permafrost is vulnerable to rapid thaw and erosion, impacting whole landscapes and ecosystems. Retrogressive thaw slumps (RTS) are abrupt permafrost disturbances that expand by several meters each year and lead to an increased soil organic carbon release. Local Remote Sensing studies identified increasing RTS activity in the last two decades by increasing number of RTS or heightened RTS growth rates. However, a large-scale assessment across diverse permafrost regions and at high temporal resolution allowing to further determine RTS thaw dynamics and its main drivers is still lacking. In this study we apply the disturbance detection algorithm LandTrendr for automated large-scale RTS mapping and high temporal thaw dynamic assessment to North Siberia (8.1×106km2). We adapted and parametrised the temporal segmentation algorithm for abrupt disturbance detection to incorporate Landsat+Sentinel-2 mosaics, conducted spectral filtering, spatial masking and filtering, and a binary machine-learning object classification of the disturbance output to separate between RTS and false positives (F1 score: 0.609). Ground truth data for calibration and validation of the workflow was collected from 9 known RTS cluster sites using very high-resolution RapidEye and PlanetScope imagery. Our study presents the first automated detection and assessment of RTS and their temporal dynamics at large-scale for 2001–2019. We identified 50,895 RTS and a steady increase in RTS-affected area from 2001 to 2019 across North Siberia, with a more abrupt increase from 2016 onward. Overall the RTS-affected area increased by 331% compared to 2000 (2000: 20,158ha, 2001–2019: 66,699ha). Contrary to this, 5 focus sites show spatio-temporal variability in their annual RTS dynamics, with alternating periods of increased and decreased RTS development, indicating a close relationship to thaw drivers. The majority of identified RTS was active from 2000 onward and only a small proportion initiated during the assessment period, indicating that the increase in RTS-affected area was mainly caused by enlarging existing RTS and not by new RTS. The detected increase in RTS dynamics suggests advancing permafrost thaw and underlines the importance of assessing abrupt permafrost disturbances with high spatial and temporal resolution at large-scales. Obtaining such consistent disturbance products will help to parametrise regional and global climate change models.","Landsat,Sentinel-2,Time series,Permafrost thaw,Multi-spectral analysis,Thermo-erosion,Retrogressive thaw slumps,"
"fuzzy/human risk analysis for maritime situational awareness and decision support","2017","Human computation (HC) is an active research field in which people play a notable role as computational elements in an automated system with the aim of arriving at a truly symbiotic human-computer interaction. Situational awareness (SA) and decision support systems (DSSs) are two domains where human computation is rapidly advancing, with the latter arising as an invaluable vehicle to achieve the former. Fuzzy systems and fuzzy logic are two commonly employed tools in these domains due to their inherent capabilities of representing and processing vague and imprecise information while conveying the analysis results in an interpretable fashion. In this paper, we elaborate on the human computation aspects of risk analysis within SA and DSS conducted with the aid of fuzzy sets. The study makes the following contributions: (1) we argue that risk analysis must be a highly automated yet still human-centric endeavour and highlight four manners in which the human component provides value to the underlying data/information fusion processes; (2) we illustrate this fuzzy/human risk analysis methodology through a multi-modular Risk Management Framework (RMF) architecture and its application to the maritime domain, particularly in hard-soft data fusion, automated response generation to maritime incidents, port anomaly filtering and dynamic risk management triggered by contextual knowledge and (3) the framework under discussion can be extrapolated to other domains with negligible effort.","decision support systems,RMF,HC,Risk management,Hidden Markov models,human computer interaction,Human computer interaction,fuzzy logic,maritime situational awareness,marine engineering,risk management,human computation,Spread spectrum communication,Decision support systems,human risk analysis,DSS,risk management framework,fuzzy systems,Data mining,Fuzzy risk analysis,"
"determination of a maintenance strategy for machinery systems of autonomous ships","2022","This paper proposes a hybrid multi-criteria decision-making approach to determine the best maintenance strategy for the machinery systems in autonomous ships of different levels of autonomy. The proposed methodology includes the Analytic Hierarchy Process to identify criteria weighting and the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution to determine the best maintenance alternative. A sensitivity analysis is conducted to determine the impact of criterion weighting on the calculated rank scores and to reveal the criticality of the criteria. The study presents and considers various hybrid maintenance strategies for autonomous ship concepts as possible maintenance alternatives. The selection of the maintenance policy that combines condition-based and time-based approaches for 3rd and 4th levels of ship autonomy, as the best maintenance alternative, demonstrates the basic idea of the study. In addition, the key findings of the paper ensure crucial insights to the maritime industry in the decision-making process on the maintenance strategy that can be adapted to different types of autonomous ship concepts.","AHP,TOPSIS,Ship machinery system,Maintenance,MASS,"
"a comparison framework for runtime monitoring approaches","2017","The full behavior of complex software systems often only emerges during operation. They thus need to be monitored at run time to check that they adhere to their requirements. Diverse runtime monitoring approaches have been developed in various domains and for different purposes. Their sheer number and heterogeneity, however, make it hard to find the right approach for a specific application or purpose. The aim of our research therefore was to develop a comparison framework for runtime monitoring approaches. Our framework is based on an analysis of the literature and existing taxonomies for monitoring languages and patterns. We use examples from existing monitoring approaches to explain the framework. We demonstrate its usefulness by applying it to 32 existing approaches and by comparing 3 selected approaches in the light of different monitoring scenarios. We also discuss perspectives for researchers.","Comparison framework,Runtime monitoring,Literature review,"

"data-driven operational risk analysis in e-commerce logistics","2019","The efficiency of E-Commerce Logistics (ECL) has become a major success factor for e-commerce companies in the competitive marketplace nowadays. However, the operation of ECL is complex and vulnerable to many risks, which would severely threaten its performance. A clear understanding of these risks would benefit a lot for conducting targeted measures to effectively mitigate their adverse effects. Therefore, this paper proposes a quantitatively analysis approach for operational risks in ECL based on extensive historical e-commerce transaction data. More specifically, the typical operation process of ECL is extracted through sequential analysis of key activities. After that, taking operation time as the key performance indicator, the performance patterns of different operation phases are analyzed. Then, considering the diverse distributions of operation time in different phases, especially the multimodal distribution of transportation time, a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) based risk analysis approach is proposed. Finally, an experimental case study is provided to measure the operational risks using real-life ECL data, and several managerial implications are also discussed based on the results.","Data analytics,Operational risks,Risk analysis,E-Commerce Logistics,Gaussian mixture model,"
"enterprise resilience and sustainability for operations of maritime container ports","2019","Recent trends in markets, technologies, demographics, regulations, organizations, energy, and environments require adaptations for operations of container ports. This paper describes resilience of ports to emergent conditions in three areas: Energy and fuels, controls and automation, and logistics transformation. First, the sustainability of energy and fuels have become a priority for ports due to growing concerns of carbon emissions. Liquified natural gas (LNG) is both a cost-effective and safe alternative fuel for reducing emissions of container ships. The feasibility and several strategies for adopting LNG bunkering at ports are described. Second, ports must leverage technological development to drive greater efficiency and operative resiliency. Recent developments in industrial automation and electrification are described. Lastly, the impact of corporate development to the region of the port is discussed. An analysis of enterprise capacity expansion includes both risks and benefits to increase competitiveness. This paper uses methodology of systems and data analysis, mathematical simulation, and risk cost-benefit optimization. The key results include identifying operational and security risks for container ports and providing strategies for risk mitigation and resilience.

"framestep: a framework for annotating semantic trajectories based on episodes","2018","We are witnessing an increasing usage of location data by a variety of applications. Consequently, information systems are required to deal with large datasets containing raw data to build high level abstractions. Semantic Web technologies offer powerful representation tools for pervasive applications. The convergence of location-based services and Semantic Web standards allows an easier interlinking and annotation of trajectories. However, due to the wide range of requirements on modeling mobile object trajectories, it is important to define a high-level data model for representing trajectory episodes and contextual elements with multiple levels of granularity and different options to represent spatial and temporal extents, as well as to express quantitative and qualitative semantic descriptions. In this article, we focus on modeling mobile object trajectories in the context of Semantic Web. First, we introduce a new version of the Semantic Trajectory Episodes (STEP) ontology to represent generic spatiotemporal episodes. Then, we present FrameSTEP as a new framework for annotating semantic trajectories based on episodes. As a result, we combine our ontology, which can represent spatiotemporal phenomena at different levels of granularity, with annotation algorithms, which allow to create instances of our model. The proposed spatial annotation algorithm explores the Linked Open Data cloud and OpenStreetMap tags to find relevant types of spatial features in order to describe the environment where the trajectory took place. Our framework can guide the development of future expert systems in trajectory analysis. It enables reasoning about knowledge gathered from large trajectory data and linked datasets in order to create several intelligent services.","Semantic web,Trajectory modeling,Trajectory annotation,"
"the twenty-first century of structural engineering research: a topic modeling approach","2022","Aiming at disclosing a general research landscape of structural engineering in the twenty-first century, this study applies the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), a topic modeling approach, to analyze 51,346 article abstracts from 23 prestigious journals in structural engineering with a publication period from 2000 to 2020. The LDA analyzes the literature inventory by extracting 50 distinguishable wordclouds, each centered around one distinct research theme and assigned a unique topic name. Subsequently, various measures have been proposed to integrate the posterior distributions of these research topics with article information such as publication year, journal name, and correspondence address. The increase index identifies five cold and hot topics, which reflect the shift of research interests in the community. Emerging research topics such as seismic risk assessment and composite material have received much more attention in recent years. Moreover, advanced metrics have been proposed to analyze the research similarity and evolution across different journals and countries/regions. As discussed in the paper, analysis findings would enable community stakeholders (e.g., students, engineers, researchers, conference organizers, journal editors, funding agencies) to explore the state of the research and develop viable strategies to further foster the healthy growth of the community. Such strategies can be (1) researchers submitting a paper to the most appropriate journal; (2) journal editors adjusting the journal focus to enhance its impact; and (3) funding agencies prioritizing research supports that best fit regional needs and circumstances, among others.","Structural engineering research,Country/region topic distribution,Topic modeling,Latent Dirichlet allocation,Cold and hot topics,Journal topic distribution,"
"an analysis of wintertime navigational accidents in the northern baltic sea","2017","Navigational accidents in wintertime conditions occur relatively frequently, yet there is little systematic knowledge available about the circumstances under which these occur. This paper presents an analysis of navigational shipping accidents in the Northern Baltic Sea area which occurred in the period 2007–2013. The analysis is based on an integration of various data sources, aiming to reconstruct the accident conditions based on the best available data sources. Apart from basic accident information from the original accident databases, data from the Automatic Identification System is used to obtain insight in the operation type during which the accident occurred, as well as into other dynamic aspects of the accident scenario. Finally, atmospheric and sea ice data is used to reconstruct the navigational conditions under which the accidents occurred. The analysis aims to provide qualitative insights in patterns and outlier cases in the accidental conditions. Correspondingly, visual data mining is selected as analysis approach, because of its utility in obtaining qualitative knowledge from data sources through a combination of visualization techniques and human interaction with the data. Special attention is given to the strength of evidence of the identified accident patterns. The results are primarily useful for improving risk analyses focusing on oil spill risks in winter conditions and for developing realistic training scenarios for oil spill response operations.","Maritime risk,Maritime safety,Winter navigation operations,Visual data mining,AIS data,Accident data analysis,"

"surface ozone in the north american pollution outflow region of nova scotia: long-term analysis of surface concentrations, precursor emissions and long-range transport influence","2021","Nova Scotia is in the air pollution outflow region of North America and experiences elevated surface air pollution episodes regularly. We present the first analysis of long-term (2000–2018) hourly ozone (O3) and ozone precursor gas trends at three Nova Scotia provincial monitoring locations (‘urban’ Halifax, ‘suburban’ Halifax at Lake Major and ‘regional background’ at Aylesford Mountain), together with an examination of provincial ozone precursor emission trends. The precursors considered are nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOC). Over the common data period for the three stations (2006–2017) the annual 99th percentile hourly ozone concentrations decreased significantly in Halifax (−0.77 ppb/year; p = 0.02) and at Aylesford (−0.65 ppb/year; p = 0.03), in agreement with regional trends. No statistically significant changes were found in high ozone at suburban Lake Major (−0.02 ppb/year; p = 0.94), but the annual 25th percentile, median, and 75th percentile hourly ozone concentrations increased significantly (p < 0.01) only at this location (1.09 ppb/year, 1.23 ppb/year, 1.03 ppb/year, respectively). This is consistent with the strong NOx-O3 titration effect in downtown Halifax decreasing over time. After correcting for the titration effect over the full study period, the annual median Halifax total ozone is found to be decreasing (−0.45 ppb/year; p = 0.02). Over the full study period, ambient concentrations of precursors decreased significantly (p < 0.01) in Halifax by −2.34 ppb/year for NOx and −3.41 μg/m3/year for VOCs, as did the ozone formation potential (OFP) of VOCs (−9.66 μg/m3/year; p < 0.01). The underlying emissions of precursors also decreased significantly (p < 0.01) in and near Halifax (provincial NOx: 3982 ppb/year; provincial VOCs: 1680 tonnes/year), also in agreement with regional trends. However, a linear regression during 2012–2018 showed a decelerating reduction of provincial NOx emissions. Provincial total VOC emissions also decreased approximately ten times slower during 2012–2018, albeit this was not statistically significant. Finally, we present an algorithm to identify events of long-range transported pollution in Halifax, based on spatial correlations in ozone across surface monitoring stations in Nova Scotia. Between 2000 and 2018, transported upstream pollution was found to be connected to between 45% and 63% of 1444 days when surface ozone was elevated in Halifax. The frequency with which transported pollution events occur increased by 15% across this time period.","Precursor emissions,Ozone,Transport,Trends,Transboundary,Nova scotia,"
"maritime search and rescue networking based on multi-agent cooperative communication","2019","Rapid and effective maritime search and rescue operations become the important guarantee for the safety of maritime navigation. The existing maritime search and rescue networking and model have slow response speed and low efficiency. The distribution, synergy, parallelism, robustness and intelligence of unmanned surface vehicle (USV) and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) provide a new idea for the novel maritime search and rescue networking, in which multi-agent could be used to build a layered control network. In this paper, a novel rapid search and rescue system is proposed by utilizing the improved ant colony optimization and the independent calculation decision of the agents. The system adopts the edge computing, relies on the information sharing and the cooperative decision between the search and rescue agent groups. It achieves the independent synchronous search and rescue. At the same time, we use particle swarm optimization to intelligently schedule data packets during the rescue process to optimize network forwarding performance. Based on the distributed cluster control of USV and UAV, this paper combines edge computing, cooperative communication and centralized task allocation together to make decision for rescue. The simulation results show that our proposed schemes realize a significant improvement for maritime search and rescue.","search and rescue,Edge computing,Unmanned aerial vehicles,cooperative communication,Satellites,edge computing,Task analysis,Base stations,swarm intelligence,Marine vehicles,Accidents,"
"potential-field data in integrated frontier basin geophysics: successes and challenges on australia's continental margin","2015","Offshore frontier sedimentary basins are characterised by a lack of constraining geological and geophysical data. This lack of data is generally the result of deep water (>500 m), difficult geology (volcanics and salt), remoteness and harsh met–ocean conditions. These characteristics present significant challenges to marine surveying, which means that frontier basins tend to be underexplored. With continuing interest in exploration for energy resources in frontier regions, many frontier basins around the world have been the focus of increasingly-sophisticated geophysical studies that integrate a range of methodologies, including those based on potential-field (gravity and magnetic) data. Underexplored frontier basins around Australia's continental margin have received increased attention during the last decade, largely as a result of government-funded programs of precompetitive data acquisition and analysis. The components of this work that have relied heavily on potential-field data include: first-pass depth-to-basement estimation using spectral techniques applied to magnetic data; enhancement of gravity and magnetic images to aid the identification of basin depocentres and to facilitate onshore–offshore geological interpretation of basement structure; multi-scale edge-detection applied to gravity and magnetic data to aid the interpretation of basement structure; 3D forward and stochastic inverse modelling of gravity data to guide seismic interpretation of sediment thickness and basement structure; and using supercomputers for high-resolution, regional-scale 3D inverse modelling of magnetic and gravity data to constrain the physical properties of the crust. Despite the additional insight offered by this work, efforts to understand frontier basins are not without challenges, one of the most fundamental of which is to ensure that non-specialists are not misinterpreting data (e.g. wrongly interpreting artefacts arising from specific processing). The other main challenge in Australian frontier basins arises from a lack of constraints on crustal structure. This leads to significant ambiguity when using gravity data to infer sediment thickness or to understand the nature of basement. This ambiguity could be vastly reduced through the acquisition of seismic refraction data that focuses on imaging crustal structure. Further opportunities exist in using alternative methods for automated depth-to-basement estimation, incorporating process-oriented rather than static potential-field modelling, and in applying 3D forward and inverse gravity and magnetic modelling to other Australian frontier basins.","Frontier basin,Petroleum exploration,Geophysics,Continental margin,"
"“ship-port-country” multi-dimensional research on the fine analysis of china's lng trade","2023","Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) is a clean and low-carbon energy source that plays an important role in combating global warming. As the world's largest greenhouse gas (GHG) emitter, China has taken coal-to-gas as an important measure to reduce GHG emissions, and has become the world's largest LNG importer. Studying the patterns and characteristics of China's LNG trade is of great significance for ensuring energy supply security, formulating and adjusting energy strategies. However, the refined analysis of China's LNG trade is still inadequate, mainly due to the lack of research on the details of ship trajectories and port attributes. Therefore, a “ship-port-country” multidimensional LNG trade analysis method is proposed to improve the timeliness, multi-dimensionality and fineness of China's LNG trade analysis. The multidimensional characteristics of China's LNG trade are analyzed by studying the big data of nearly 3.5 billion automatic identification system (AIS) records in 2017. The study has found that (1) The arrival frequency of China's LNG trading ships varies greatly with time. For example, the most frequent daily arrivals are between 04:00 and 05:00 in the morning, while the least frequent arrivals are between 15:00 and 17:00 in the afternoon. (2) The Chinese LNG trade network consisting of 79 ports has been formed, of which NANTONG Port is the most important port. (3) The LNG trade volume calculated in this study has shown a strong correlation with the national LNG trade statistics and can be used to analyze LNG trade with higher spatial and temporal resolution. According to the characteristics of LNG trade at the three levels of ship, port and country, China can optimize its LNG trade policy from the following aspects: (1) Dynamically allocate port resources according to the arrival frequency of LNG tankers to reduce port congestion and waste of resources. (2) Expand core LNG trading ports such as NANTONG Port, ZHOUSHAN Port, TANGSHAN (JINGTANG) Port, XIUYU Port, DALIAN Port and LUSHUN Port. (3) Actively realize the diversification of LNG trading partners to reduce the dependence of LNG import sources on one country or region, and ensure energy security. The “ship-port-country” multi-level LNG trade analysis method proposed in this study provides a new research perspective for the analysis of the LNG trade pattern. This study reveals the multidimensional characteristics of China's LNG trade, which can provide decision-making support for China to formulate reasonable LNG trade policies and energy security policies, and is conducive to the stable and sustainable development of global LNG trade.","Multidimensional analysis,Ship trajectory data,China's LNG trade,LNG trade,Fine-grained trade characteristics,"
"statistical modeling of evaporation duct channel for maritime broadband communications","2022","The sixth-generation communication networks aim to integrate space, air, and ground communications into a robust network. However, maritime communications are confronted with the challenge of the atmospheric duct, which could capture wireless signals and propagate beyond the line of sight.

The constant coefficients of each variable in the modeling are calculated by the least square method, and the specific distribution of shadow fading in channel modeling is determined by the Kullback-Leibler divergence method. Furthermore, the partitioning around medoids method is utilized to reduce the average deviation and improve the accuracy of the model.

"influence of atmospheric circulation and local parameters on activity concentration of gross alpha and gross beta in granada, spain","2023","This work analyses the influence of local meteorology and air mass origin on radioactivity levels measured in Granada (Southern Spain). To the scope, gross α and gross β activities at ground-level air were weekly recorded from 2006 to 2021, by collecting aerosol filters and successively analysing them by low-level proportional counting. Time series decomposition shows a strong correlation between the seasonal components of gross α and gross β and the local meteorological parameters, in particular temperature and wind speed. Back trajectories reaching the study area during the sampling, calculated at three height levels (750 m, 1500 m, and 3000 m a.s.l.), were analysed by three methods with the aim to determine the main characteristics of air masses reaching Granada, and their impact on airborne radioactivity levels. The results of the residence time and clustering analyses showed that an increase in the radioactivity levels in the southeast of Spain is connected with air masses coming from the Mediterranean at 750 m and from the South (Sahara Desert) at 3000 m. In line with the outcomes obtained by the cluster analysis, the Concentration Weighted Trajectory (WCWT) results highlight that the air masses transported from Mediterranean and African regions are a potential source of gross α and gross β. Moreover, the findings of the WCWT bring a new aspect by revealing that the southern France region can also have a significant contribution to gross alpha and beta activities.","Gross alpha,Radioactivity,Back-trajectories,Gross beta,Air masses,"
"timing of the neoglacial onset on the north-eastern antarctic peninsula based on lacustrine archive from lake anónima, vega island","2020","To understand the complexity of the climate patterns in the Holocene, it is necessary to build detailed chronologies that provide a holistic picture of the individual climate periods occurring in the polar regions. In this regard, here we present a completely new, 14C-dated and synchronised multi-proxy chronology from the Lake Anónima (Vega Island, north-eastern Antarctic Peninsula) that provides a unique insight into the Late Holocene environment. In particular, we aim to interpret the substantial environmental and climatic change between the mid-late Holocene Hypsithermal and Neoglacial periods using various geochemical (total organic carbon, X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy), petrophysical (magnetic susceptibility, laser granulometry) and biological (diatom biostratigraphy) proxies. The termination of the mid-late Holocene Hypsithermal, characterised by overall warmer climate with favourable conditions for biogenic productivity, is followed by the regional-scale Neoglacial period, distinctive by the onset of climate deterioration, decreased siliciclastic input, suppressed biogenic (diatom) productivity and low organic content. Based on a principal component analysis, a multi-proxy record provides the precise timing of the Neoglacial onset in the Lake Anónima record at 2050 (2σ: 1990–2130) cal. yrs BP. Applying an adjacent and correlative ice-core (James Ross Island ice cap, r = 0.42), as well as a composite lake sediment (Beak Island, r = 0.49) chronologies, our research provides a refined timing of the Neoglacial onset for the north-eastern Antarctic Peninsula, which is determined to be 2070 ± 50 yrs.

The regional distribution of aerosols over the Indian Ocean and the influence of long-range transport during the Asian dry period of November–April of 1996–1999 are studied, based on satellite derived aerosol optical depth (AOD) and the wind data obtained from the NCEP-NCAR reanalysis. AOD over the Indian Ocean region is observed to be significantly influenced by the transport of aerosols from Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia and Arabia. AOD as well as its latitude gradient in the Northern Hemisphere generally increase from November to April. High aerosol loading observed over the Indian Ocean during February–April period of 1999 is closely associated with the changes in atmospheric circulation features and transport from the Asian continent.","Aerosol transport,Indian Ocean experiment,ElNino,Optical depth,Satellite remote sensing,"
"comparison of two atmospheric correction approaches applied to modis measurements over north american waters","2018","Using in situ data of spectral remote sensing reflectance (Rrs, sr−1) collected over North American oceanic, coastal and estuarine waters between 2002 and 2016 (N = 942), we evaluate two atmospheric correction approaches applied to MODIS measurements. One is the POLYnomial based approach originally designed for MERIS (POLYMER) but adopted and implemented for MODIS, and the other is the traditional Gordon and Wang (1994b) near-infrared (NIR) approach with iteration to account for non-negligible NIR water-leaving radiance, which is currently embedded in the SeaWiFS Data Analysis System (SeaDAS) software package and used operationally by NASA for processing MODIS data (termed as NASA standard atmospheric correction or NSAC). The approaches are evaluated for both quality and quantity of their retrieved Rrs in the visible domain. The quality is gauged through three statistical measures between in situ and MODIS-retrieved Rrs: root mean square error (RMSE, sr−1), unbiased root mean square (uRMS), and mean bias (δ, sr−1). For common points where both approaches yield valid Rrs retrievals, POLYMER shows worse performance than NSAC for blue bands (<488 nm) and comparable performance for green and red bands. However, POLYMER shows the ability to retrieve more valid Rrs data points (2–3 folds) than NSAC for this evaluation dataset primarily because the latter fails over strong sun glint regions where the MODIS NIR bands saturate but the former is designed to work over sun glint regions using non-saturation MODIS bands. For those data points where only POLYMER yield valid Rrs retrievals, data quality is slightly worse than from the common data points. Although these results may vary slightly among individual subregions, it is generally true that POLYMER may be used as a surrogate of NSAC for atmospheric correction of MODIS when data quantity is significantly limited due to perturbations of sun glint and thin clouds that are typical for subtropical and tropical regions.","Atmospheric correction,SeaDAS,POLYMER,Ocean color,MODIS,"
"anomaly detection in maritime data based on geometrical analysis of trajectories","2015","Anomaly detection is an important use of the Automatic Identification Systems (AIS), because it offers support to users to evaluate if a vessel is in trouble or causing trouble. For instance, it can be used to detect if a ship is doing something that may cause an accident or if it has changed its route to avoid bad weather condition. In this work, a new method for finding anomalies in the ships' movements is proposed. The method analyzes the trajectory of ships from a geometrical perspective. The trajectory of the ship is compared with a near-optimal path that is generated by a graph search algorithm. The proposed method extracts some scale-invariant features from the real trajectory and also from the optimal movement pattern, and it compares the two sets of features to generate an abnormality score. The method is unsupervised and it does not require training. Instead of labeling the trajectories as normal/abnormal it calculates a score value that denotes the extent of abnormality. The scoring scheme provides a ranking system in which the user can sort the trajectories based on their abnormality score. This is useful when dealing with large number of trajectories and the user wants to picks the most abnormal cases. For the evaluation, the method was run on three months data of North Pacific Ocean and score values were generated. Among the entire dataset, 100 randomly chosen trajectories were labeled by an expert.

"neglected infrastructures for 6g—underwater communications: how mature are they?","2023","In recent years, we have witnessed a major expansion of wireless communications, extending from terrestrial to aerial spaces to facilitate novel user services. While aerial access infrastructure is widely accepted to be an essential part of a comprehensive sixth-generation (6G) network, underwater wireless communications (UWC), unfortunately, are neglected. This observation questions us about the maturity of UWC technologies and its potentials for 6G. First, we describe an overview of 6G access infrastructures, revealing the gaps concerning underserved spaces and services. Next, we investigate current developments of cutting-edge technologies that enable heterogeneous multiaccess UWCs. Furthermore, we introduce UWC-enabled application scenarios that possibly improve the popularity of 6G in aquatic environments. Then, we analyze a feasible approach for a UWC integration to complement the 6G infrastructures, achieving a fully comprehensive framework. Finally, open challenges are discussed to drive future studies toward the maturation of UWC. This study is expected to facilitate interested researchers and engineers with a systematical reference framework of state-of-the-art UWC knowledge and information.","6G network,Underwater sensor network,Wireless communication,Underwater communication,"
"visual attention assessment for expert-in-the-loop training in a maritime operation simulator","2020","Improving the training programs for maritime operations is beneficial to enhance the maritime safety in practice. In this article, we propose a novel approach to the assessment of visual attention in a maritime operation so as to support an expert-in-the-loop training program. Experts' knowledge of maritime operation and experiences in the simulator are incorporated into the training program in three ways. First, through a questionnaire, information about task division, identification of critical operation, and definitions of areas of interest (AOIs) are incorporated as prior knowledge for modeling visual attention. Second, a weight scale factor that emphasizes the high importance of visual focus in critical operations is utilized to generate an operations-dependent attention map. Third, based on an expert's attention map and visual switch between AOIs, a similarity metric is designed as a comprehensive evaluation between saliency and visual transition. A case study of heavy lifting operation is performed by two groups of trainees who have received different briefings about â€œcritical operation.â€ The assessment result shows that the group with more detailed briefing obtains a 6% similarity score higher than the other group, which is consistent with the debriefing result of a superior performance of that group. The proposed approach is thus verified effective in assessing visual attention for the expert-in-the-loop training program.","Safety,visual attention assessment,maritime safety,operations-dependent attention map,Informatics,maritime operations training program,expert-in-the-loop training program,computer simulation,marine safety,marine engineering,eye tracking data,eye,feature extraction,saliency map,computer aided instruction,educational administrative data processing,maritime operation simulator,Tracking,Training,eye tracking,Visualization,maritime operation,visual attention,Task analysis,gaze tracking,Area of interest,"

As part of the study we interviewed several individuals from ship owners, ship operators, yards as well as equipment suppliers. Many of the interviewed actors have informal and ad-hoc strategies for managing the software integrated on ships and associated systems. This paper identifies the need for protocols and supportive systems to match these challenges.

"noise reduction and atmospheric correction for coastal applications of landsat thematic mapper imagery","1999","The Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) has three visible bands centered at 485 nm, 560 nm, and 660 nm which can be used for ocean applications. This article presents a method for deriving the bottom albedo from the TM in coastal waters. Our study of historical TM images shows degradation of the sensor through time. Pattern noise in the imagery in Bands 2 and 3 was analyzed and removed using a combination of Fourier filtering and edge-detection techniques. Noise was first examined over clear and deep nearby oceanic waters, and the filter algorithms developed there were applied to the entire image. To estimate water-leaving radiance from the satellite sensor, Rayleigh and aerosol path radiance were removed. Radiance due to aerosol scattering was calculated for offshore pixels assuming a marine aerosol type, and it was removed as a constant from the entire scene. The TM sensor calibration was validated by comparing water-leaving radiance values over the clear waters of the Florida current with known, normalized water-leaving radiance values. Corrections for water path radiance and water-column attenuation of bottom-reflected radiance were made for regions of known depth, allowing the bottom albedo and vegetative pixel fraction to be determined for shallow reef areas in the Florida Keys.",""
"transcriptomic profiling reveals the neuroendocrine-disrupting effect and toxicity mechanism of tbbpa-dhee exposure in zebrafish (danio rerio) during sexual development","2023","TBBPA bis(2-hydroxyethyl) ether (TBBPA-DHEE) pollution in the environment has raised serious public health concerns due to its potential neuroendocrine-disrupting effects. The neuroendocrine-disrupting effects of TBBPA-DHEE on marine spices, on the other hand, have received little attention. The behavioral, neuroendocrine-disrupting, and possible reproductive toxicity of TBBPA-DHEE were assessed in sexual developing zebrafish treated for 40 days by examining locomotor activity, Gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels, and quantifying gene expression. In addition, transcriptome profiling was carried out to explore the possible mechanisms. According to our findings, TBBPA-DHEE treated zebrafish showed altered locomotor activity, a potential neuroendocrine-disrupting effect via the toxic effect on the hypothalamus and pituitary gland, which is evident in decreased levels of GnRH, FSH, and LH, according to our findings. The transcriptomic profiling reveals that a total of 216 DEGs were detected (5 upregulated and 211 down-regulated). Transcriptomic analysis shows that TBBPA-DHEE exposure caused decreased transcript levels of genes (cyp11a1, ccna1, ccnb2, ccnb1, cpeb1b, wee2) involved in cell cycle oocyte meiosis, progesterone mediated oocyte maturation, and ovarian steroidogenesis, which are known reproduction-related pathways. Overall, these findings add to our understanding of the impact of TBBPA-DHEE and biomonitoring in the maritime environment.","Reproductive toxicity,TBBPA-DHEE,Zebrafish,Transcriptomics,Locomotor behavior,Neuroendocrine-disruption,"

"a provably secure mobile user authentication scheme for big data collection in iot-enabled maritime intelligent transportation system","2023","The emergence of contemporary technologies like cloud computing and the Internet of Things (IoT) has revolutionized the trends in the cyber world to serve humanity. There are plenty of applications in which they are being used, especially in smart cities and their constituents, Maritime Transportation System (MTS) is one of them. The IoT-enabled MTS has the potential to entertain the growing challenges of modern-day ship transportation. Secure real-time data access from numerous smart IoT devices is the most critical and crucial exercise for Big Data acquisition in IoT-enabled MTS.

"characterization of maritime rf/fso channel","2011","The growing demand on high speed data transmission as well as the bandwidth limitation of microwave (RF) transmission has stimulated the development of free-space optical (FSO) laser communication links during the last years. Making the data transmission reliable is one of the challenging problems that have to be solved to establish a communication system suitable for commercial usage. Optical transmission is highly impacted by different channel conditions, leading from signal damping to turbulence effects due to the atmosphere. In this paper a hybrid RF/FSO maritime channel is investigated. The link distance under investigation is about 14 km. Transmitted data collected during a 6 months measurement campaign is evaluated and theoretically analyzed. The correlation between weather and atmospheric impacts to the large amount of RF and FSO transmission data available, will provide an insight into the capability of estimating channel quality.","telecommunication network reliability,Absorption,atmospheric turbulence,high speed data transmission,optical links,Radio frequency,bandwidth limitation,free-space optical laser communication links,data transmission reliability,Atmospheric modeling,Scattering,data communication,Attenuation,hybrid RF-FSO maritime channel,signal damping,atmosphere turbulence effect,wireless channels,marine communication,Rain,microwave transmission,Damping,optical transmission,"

We presented results for the 2000–2008 period concerning the trend analysis for ambient ozone concentrations and related forest damages, with the Mann and seasonal Kendall tests. Ozone precursor’s emissions from Europe have been reduced over the last 20 years. Decreases in annual averages, median, 25th and 98th percentiles and maxima values were found. The seasonal trend analysis for the high-lying stations showed a decreasing trend for the warm season, when main ozone production is the photochemistry, and an increase for the cold period, caused by a reduced ozone titration.

"shipping and ship recycling related oil pollution detection in çandarlı bay (turkey) using satellite monitoring","2019","Çandarlı Bay is a marine environment at risk of heavy pollution because of industrial facilities including the only ship recycling zone of Turkey, and intense marine traffic related to the raw materials needs of a dense industrial zone. These risk factors make the development of practical environmental management strategies increasingly necessary. Oil spills from the heavy ship traffic, one of the major risks, can be detected by satellite remote sensing technologies. In this study, it is aimed to show spatial characteristics of oil spills as well as its dynamics in the time domain of the bay. Results from a three year period of the study show that as a main environmental problem, oil pollution has a relatively high percentage of spatial distribution in the bay. It is therefore concluded that regular monitoring of the intense oil pollution in the bay is required with an agile and low-cost method of satellite monitoring to intervene in good time and to minimize its impacts. The study provided an extensive understanding of spatio-temporal dynamics of oil pollution in the bay. The approach used will also provide a baseline for decision-makers to develop environmental management plans for other coastal zones with similar sensitivities.","The synthetic radar monitoring (SAR),Ship recycling,Spatio-temporal analysis,Çandarlı Bay (Turkey),Oil pollution from ships,"

"long-term trends in daily extreme air temperature indices in ireland from 1885 to 2018","2022","Long-term instrumental series are crucial to analyse extreme air temperature indices and to examine modern climate warming within a historical context. This research provides the first assessment in Ireland of the frequency, duration, intensity and geographical distribution of the daily extreme air temperature indices recommended by the ETCCDI (Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices) and based on long-term rescued, quality-controlled and homogenised data. Prior analysis of air temperature indices in Ireland had focused on the period since the second half of the 20th century, where digital data were readily available. Earlier estimations of long-term air temperature trends in Ireland focused on non-homogenised data from a small network of stations. For this research, 11 long-term (1885–2018) maximum and minimum air temperature series were analysed to assess seasonal and annual trends and construct extreme air temperature indices in Ireland. The non-parametric Mann-Kendall test was employed to test the statistical significance of the maximum and minimum air temperatures and indices trends (p < 0.05). Significant increasing trends were assessed in the seasonal and annual maximum and minimum air temperature series in Ireland, with greater increases in the spring and autumn seasons. Significant increasing trends were determined in the warm days (+6.8 days), warm nights (+7.5 nights), warm spell duration index (+3.9 days), growing season length (+22 days), coldest night (+2.7 °C) and coldest day (+1.5 °C) in the period 1885–2018 in Ireland. In the same period, significant decreasing trends were identified in the cold days (−9.3 days), cold nights (−7 nights), frost days (−13.7 days), cold spell duration index (−6.9 days) and diurnal air temperature range (−0.1 °C) in Ireland. The results follow global patterns presented in the Six Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The findings of this research will be crucial to assist stakeholders and policymakers in defining climate action, adaptation and mitigation plans in response to shifting trends in air temperature extremes.","Air temperature trends,Historical weather extremes,Ireland,Extreme air temperature indices,Climate change,"
"a biogeochemical orientation survey in the moisan gold-mineralized area, haenam district in korea","2011","A biogeochemical orientation survey was carried out in the vicinity of an epithermal Au deposit in the Moisan Au–Ag mineralized area, Haenam district in Korea. The Au–Ag bearing quartz veins of the mine occur as narrow open-space fillings within Cretaceous silicic pyroclastics. The vein minerals consist mainly of quartz, sericite, pyrite, chalcopyrite, and galena, with some electrum and argentite. The main objectives of this study were to study the geochemical characteristics of rocks, soils and plants in this area, to investigate the spatial relationship between Au and associated elements in rock–soil–plant system, and to evaluate the applicability of biogeochemical prospecting for Au vein occurrences in Korea. Samples of rocks and soils, and leaves of three plant species (Japanese red pine — P. densiflora, oriental white oak — Q. aliena, Japanese mallotus — M. japonicus) were collected from the target mineralized area and control barren locations, and analyzed for trace elements by instrumental neutron activation analysis. Sampling lines were composed of one slope line which is almost parallel to the mineralized quartz-veins, and four transect lines spaced 100m apart across the veins at 20m sampling intervals. From the multi-element data of rock samples (n=9), high values of Au (maximum 2030ppb) are spatially related to Au–quartz veins. Soil samples (n=61) collected from five sampling lines show higher values of Au (24–825ppb) whereas soil samples from the control locations have lower values of Au (below 25ppb). Many plant species collected from the vicinity of the veins have high Au contents compared with those at the control locations, but the ranges of Au values are variable among plant species. In a total of 128 samples of plant leaves, Q. aliena yielded Au values of 0.4 to 6.9ppb, and M. japonicus 0.9 to 4.1ppb. Gold contents in P. densiflora ranged from 0.1 to 5.6ppb. Plant leaves from control areas show less than 1.6ppb Au. The biological absorption coefficient (BAC) of Au in plants decreases in the order of Q. aliena>M. japonicus>P. densiflora. Based on the results of the study, Q. aliena appeared to be the best sampling media for biogeochemical prospecting of Au in the study area.","Au anomaly,Biogeochemical survey,Gold–quartz veins,"

The methodology is applied to needs arising from the field of Arctic maritime safety and security, in order to provide a roadmap for an ongoing multi-national European Union (EU) funded research project. A needs hierarchy containing topics, needs and sub-needs is first formed by utilization of multiple sources including facilitated stakeholder workshops, literature review and semi-structured questionnaires. A further round of stakeholder opinion is then sought in order to ascertain the importance and level of challenge involved in solving each identified sub-need. This information is utilized to form a PICK (Possible, Implement, Challenge, Keep Back) chart in order to visualize and categorize the sub-needs. A goal programming knapsack model is formulated to select a set of priority needs that satisfy goals relating to the maximization of overall importance, the balance between topics at the first level of the need hierarchy and the balance between more challenge (for longer term research) and implement (for shorter term implementation) needs. Sensitivity analysis is conducted around the number of chosen projects and the goal programming weights. Conclusions are hence drawn with respect to the methodology and the Arctic maritime safety and security field of application.","OR in maritime sector,Multiple criteria analysis,Research prioritization,Arctic security and safety,Goal programming,"

"magnetic susceptibility and heavy-metal contamination in topsoils along the izmit gulf coastal area and izaytas (turkey)","2010","The study on topsoil contamination due to heavy metals was carried out by using the Magnetic susceptibility (MS) measurements in Izmit industrial city, northern Turkey. We attempted to investigate correlations between the concentration of selected heavy metals and the MS from 41 sample sites around Izmit Gulf. These investigations let us quantify and standardize the MS method, which may have consequences for long term monitoring of anthropogenic pollution, especially in urban areas. The MS surfer contour map based on the topsoil measurements was compiled with a randomly ranged distance density. The soil samples collected throughout the industrial areas, the parks, road sides and residential areas were also analyzed by Atomic Absorption Spectrometer. Heavy metals Cu, Ni, Cr and Pb show strong correlations with MS, while Zn and Co show a weak correlation with MS. Moreover, the Tomlinson pollution load index (PLI) shows insignificant correlation with the MS. The MS was examined vertically (0–30cm) with respect to anthropogenic and/or lithogenic influences at the fourteen sample sites. The maximum values were mostly observed in depths of 2–5cm and the MS values on the depth profiles vary between 10×10−8m3kg−1 and 203×10−8m3kg−1. The study revealed that MS is an inexpensive, fast and non-destructive method for the detection and mapping of contaminated soils.","Heavy metals,Izmit,Magnetic susceptibility,Turkiye,Soil contamination,"

"an adaptive network security system for iot-enabled maritime transportation","2023","With the rapid growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) applications in Maritime Transportation Systems (MTS), cyber-attacks and challenges in data safety have also increased extensively. Meanwhile, the IoT devices are resource-constrained and cannot implement the existing security systems, making them susceptible to various types of debilitating cyber-attacks. The dynamics in the attack processes in IoT-enabled MTS networks keep changing, which makes a traditional offline or batch ML-based attack detection systems intractable to apply. This paper provides a novel approach of using an adaptive incremental passive-aggressive machine learning (AI-PAML) method to create a network attack detection system (NADS) to protect the IoT devices in an MTS environment. In this paper, we propose an NADS that utilizes a multi-access edge computing (MEC) platform to provide computational resources to execute the proposed model at a network end. Since online learning models face data saturation problems, we present an improved approximate linear dependence and a modified hybrid forgetting mechanism to filter the inefficient data and keep the detection model up-to-date. The proposed data filtering ensures that the model does not experience a rapid increase in unwarranted data, which affects the modelâ€™s attack detection rate.

"incorporating discrete unmanned maritime system data collections into ncei synthesized data products","2020","In recent years, Unmanned Maritime Systems (UMS) have become widely used in hydrographic surveys and oceanographic studies, especially in coastal regions. NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) has received an increased amount of data collected by UMS in the past 10 years. A variety of different types of data are typically collected simultaneously by UMS, which raises questions about the best practices for UMS data management. In this manuscript, we discuss enhancing the value of UMS data through integration into NCEI synthesized products. These products range from data-type specific databases like the Surface Underway Marine Database, and the World Ocean Database to analyses (value-added) products such as climatological mean fields and ocean time series of variables such as ocean heat and oxygen content. Data from Saildrones and Wave Glider missions demonstrate how data collected by Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USV) are integrated into the Surface Underway Marine Database. The integration of data from Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUV) systems - such as gliders - into the World Ocean Database is also described. Data management procedures and quality controls are discussed. The application of standardized methods adds long-term value to the original UMS, and improves the quality and reliability of the synthesized products. NCEI stewardship practices maximize NOAA's investment in environmental research, converting scientific insights into dynamic, usable information that inform strategy and decision making in government, academia, and the private sector.","NCEI stewardship practices,Vehicle dynamics,ocean heat,remotely operated vehicles,Surface waves,Essential Oceanographic Variables,Unmanned Underwater Vehicle,Data Synthesis,Unmanned underwater vehicles,underwater vehicles,climatological mean fields,World Ocean Database,oceanographic equipment,Glider,marine engineering,Databases,Unmanned Underwater Vehicles systems,autonomous underwater vehicles,Sea surface,NCEI synthesized products,US Government agencies,data-type specific databases,data management procedures,Time series analysis,climatology,Saildrone,oceanographic regions,Unmanned Maritime Systems,NOAA investment,NOAA NCEI,Unmanned Surface Vehicle,unmanned surface vehicles,Data Management,discrete UMS data collections,marine vehicles,oxygen content,National Centers for Environmental Information,surface underway marine database,UMS data management,oceanographic techniques,"
"use of noma for maritime communication networks with p-df relaying channel","2020","In this paper, a partial de-code-and-forward (P-DF) cooperative relaying network (CRN) with non-orthogonal multiple access (P-DF-CRN-NOMA) for maritime space communications is proposed. Without loss of generality, three kinds of relay forwarding protocols are studied to characterize the superiority of the proposed P-DF-CRN-NOMA scheme, where, after receptions from the coastal base station (BS), the island relay forwards the successful decoded symbols to the ship user to avoid the performance loss provided by the high decoding requirement in decode-and-forward (DF). To further improve the system performance, as well as for a fairness comparison, the maximum ratio combining (MRC) is utilized at the ship user. Specifically, to present the impact of the channel qualities, the scenarios of the weak and strong links that from the source to destination (S-D) are both considered. The closed-form expressions for the outage probability of the P-DF-CRN-NOMA are derived considering the three proposed forwarding cases. Qualitative numerical results corroborating our theoretical analysis, especially for the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), show that the proposed P-DF-CRN-NOMA scheme significantly improves the outage probability performance in comparison to the conventional CRN-NOMA schemes. Furthermore, for an increased S-D link, the corresponding outage probability performance will be also better for all the cases.","Decoding,telecommunication network reliability,cooperative relaying networks (CRN),nonorthogonal multiple access,Marine vehicles,non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA),maritime space communications,outage probability,decoding,Power system reliability,NOMA,Communication networks,Relays,error statistics,power allocation,P-DF relaying channel,maximum ratio combining,cooperative relaying network,protocols,relay networks (telecommunication),diversity reception,partial decode and forward network,coastal base station,decode and forward communication,cooperative communication,probability,relay forwarding protocols,marine communication,outage probability performance,Probability,maritime communication networks,multi-access systems,island relay,partial decode-and-for-ward (P-DF),P-DF-CRN-NOMA scheme,"
"probabilistic associative learning of vessel motion patterns at multiple spatial scales for maritime situation awareness","2007","An improved neurobiologically inspired algorithm for situation awareness in the maritime domain is presented, which takes real-time tracking information and learns motion pattern models on-the- fly, enabling the models to adapt well to evolving situations while maintaining high levels of performance. The constantly refined models, resulting from concurrent incremental learning, are used to evaluate the behavior patterns of vessels based on their present motion states. Improvement to the associative learning law for learning temporal associations between vessel events enables conditional probabilities between events to be learned incrementally and locally. This allows weights in the learned model to be interpreted more readily, enabling better location prediction performance. Improvement in prediction performance is achieved by using multiple spatial scales to represent position, enabling the most relevant spatial scale to be used for local vessel behavior. Features and performance of these updates to the learning system using recorded data are described.","learning temporal associations,probabilistic associative learning,maritime,neural networks,Neural networks,Situation awareness,Predictive models,Learning systems,multiple spatial scales,data recording,real-time tracking information,marine engineering,Performance analysis,Training data,learning,Real time systems,Information technology,Tracking,conditional probabilities,maritime situation awareness,concurrent incremental learning,learning (artificial intelligence),Event detection,Terrorism,prediction,vessel motion patterns,"

"a statistical analysis of the maritime accidents in 2015-2020 in china waters","2023","In recent years, maritime accidents have occurred frequently, resulting in significant economic losses and casualties, posing a significant challenge to maritime safety that needs to be addressed. The investigation reports of maritime accidents in China from 2015 to 2020 are collected for analyzing the spatiotemporal characteristics and causations. Additionally, regression analysis is employed to explore the correlation between different indicators. The results show that maritime accidents are mostly collision accidents and ordinary accidents, with more accidents occurring from 16:00 to 20:00 and in the fourth quarter of the year, and most accidents occur in waterway waters. The accident mainly occurred in bulk carriers and small ships with less than 3000 gross tonnages. The number of accidents is significantly related to the number of coastal production wharf berths. The main human factors are negligence in the lookout, inappropriate evasive action, over speed, and improper operation. According to the analysis results, suggestions on maritime safety supervision are put forward to reduce the probability of accidents.","marine accidents,Transportation,Safety,accident characteristics,economic losses,bulk carriers,Human factors,Sea measurements,human factors,regression analysis,statistical analysis,ships,marine safety,coastal production wharf berth,casualties,Production,human factor,small ships,Wind,accident analysis,maritime safety supervision,Training,China water,maritime accident,probability,collision accident,accident prevention and control,spatiotemporal characteristics,"

"physical-biological drivers modulating phytoplankton seasonal succession along the northern antarctic peninsula","2023","The Northern Antarctic Peninsula (NAP) shows shifts in phytoplankton distribution and composition along its warming marine ecosystems. However, despite recent efforts to mechanistically understand these changes, little focus has been given to the phytoplankton seasonal succession, remaining uncertainties regarding to distribution patterns of emerging taxa along the NAP. To fill this gap, we collected phytoplankton (pigment and microscopy analysis) and physico-chemical datasets during spring and summer (November, February and March) of 2013/2014 and 2014/2015 off the NAP. Satellite measurements (sea surface temperature, sea ice concentration and chlorophyll-a) were used to extend the temporal coverage of analysis associated with the in situ sampling. We improved the quantification and distribution pattern of emerging taxa, such as dinoflagellates and cryptophytes, and described a contrasting seasonal behavior and distinct fundamental niche between centric and pennate diatoms. Cryptophytes and pennate diatoms preferentially occupied relatively shallower mixing layers compared with centric diatoms and dinoflagellates, suggesting differences between these groups in distribution and environment occupation over the phytoplankton seasonal succession. Under colder conditions, negative sea surface temperature anomalies were associated with positive anomalies of sea ice concentration and duration. Therefore, based on sea ice–phytoplankton growth relationship, large phytoplankton biomass accumulation was expected during the spring/summer of 2013/2014 and 2014/2015 along the NAP. However, there was a decoupling between sea ice concentration/duration and phytoplankton biomass, characterizing two seasonal periods of low biomass accumulation (negative chlorophyll-a anomalies), associated with the top-down control in the region. These results provide an improved mechanistic understanding on physical-biological drivers modulating phytoplankton seasonal succession along the Antarctic coastal waters.","Shifts,Top-down control,Upper ocean physical structures,Southern ocean,Phytoplankton taxa,Climate change,"
"on the seasonal variability and the spatial distribution of lightning activity over the broader greek area and their connection to atmospheric circulation","2018","The spatio-temporal regime of lightning strokes over the broader Greek area is studied using 15-day ZEUS cloud-to-ground lightning data for a 10-year period (2005–14). The multivariate statistical method Factor Analysis (S-mode and T-mode) is applied on the mean intra-annual variation of lightning in order to reveal: i) the main modes of intra-annual variation of lighting activity that correspond to specific sub-regions of the Greek area and ii) the main characteristic patterns of strokes prevailing during specific periods of the year (“seasons”). According to the results there are three main modes of intra-annual variation: a) the continental one with maximum lightning activity in early summer, b) the Ionian Sea one with maximum in early autumn and c) the Aegean Sea one with maxima in middle autumn and late May. Also, according to the patterns of strokes, three main “seasons” are found: a) the summer one (early May–middle August) with highest lightning activity over the continental regions of the country due to the atmospheric instability associated with the intense land heating and the persistence of cool upper air masses, b) the winter one (middle December–middle February) with the maximum of lightning activity over the sea where instability is high due to the frequent prevalence of cold air masses over the warm sea-surface and the associated passages of Mediterranean depressions and c) the autumn one (early September–middle October) with maximum over northwestern Greece associated with the early cold season low pressure systems, the warm sea body of Ionian Sea and the essential role of topography.",""

"quantifying schumann resonances’ variation over time through statistical differences","2023","Schumann resonances’ statistical parameters vary over time, which gives way to analyze them as a stochastic process. By splitting the Schumann resonance’s records into segments and obtaining their empirical distribution function, the differences can be evaluated by calculating the Kolmogorov–Smirnov distance between them. The analysis’ results allow for the characterization of the Schumann resonance’s variations, along with the typical values it reaches under the chosen metric. It is shown how divergence is mitigated through sample averaging, and also how divergent samples impact on the Fast Fourier Transform algorithm. Divergence quantification adds a layer of information for data processing. Knowing the changes experienced over time in Schumann resonances gives a way to know what kind of mathematical procedures can be applied to the signal. Quantification of signal variations over time can identify error sources in specific procedures, filter out samples unfit under certain analyses, or serve as a stop criteria for cumulative analyses.","Statistical distance,Schumann resonance,Kolmogorov–Smirnov distance,Stochastic process,"

The fault current is measured using the current transformers that are already present in the system as part of a time-inverse overcurrent protection. Simulation results show that the symmetrical components of the currents seen by these current transformers can be used to detect the electric fault.

"review and analysis of fire and explosion accidents in maritime transportation","2018","The globally expanding shipping industry has several hazards such as collision, capsizing, foundering, grounding, stranding, fire, and explosion. Accidents are often caused by more than one contributing factor through complex interaction. It is crucial to identify root causes and their interactions to prevent and understand such accidents. This study presents a detailed review and analysis of fire and explosion accidents that occurred in the maritime transportation industry during 1990–2015. The underlying causes of fire and explosion accidents are identified and analysed. This study also reviewed potential preventative measures to prevent such accidents. Additionally, this study compares properties of alternative fuels and analyses their effectiveness in mitigating fire and explosion hazards. It is observed that Cryogenic Natural Gas (CrNG), Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) and methanol have properties more suitable than traditional fuels in mitigating fire risk and appropriate management of their hazards could make them a safer option to traditional fuels. However, for commercial use at this stage, there exist several uncertainties due to inadequate studies, and technological immaturity. This study provides an insight into fire and explosion accident causation and prevention, including the prospect of using alternative fuels for mitigating fire and explosion risks in maritime transportation.","Preventive measures,Fire and explosion,Alternative fuels,Maritime accidents,"

"well water trace element reconnaissance, eastern maritime canada","1976","A geochemical survey involving the collection and analysis of about 2000 well water samples from an area of roughly 25,000 km2 was carried out during the 1975 field season over parts of the Carboniferous basin of eastern Canada. This report describes the results of 1721 regional well sites. Three samples of water were collected from each site and analyzed in four different laboratories for twenty constituents. The distribution and relationships of U, Rn, He F, CH4, Zn, Cu, Pb, Mn, Fe, pH, suspended matter, depth of well, conductivity and alkalinity are described. The elements U, Rn, He, F, along with conductivity and alkalinity, show systematic regional patterns indicating broad regional belts of element enrichment which are being leached by circulating groundwaters. The close spatial association of these elements over many tens of miles suggests chemical reaction cells or fronts similar to those observed in the uranium mining districts of Colorado and Wyoming in the United States and elsewhere. Their relatively weak character suggests an intermediate cycle in the cyclic enrichment hypothesis believed to be responsible for the formation of epigenetic uranium ore deposits. The heavy elements Zn, Cu, Pb, Mn, and Fe show positive correlation with each other but their spatial distribution is more spotty than that of the uranium elements. Broadly speaking the anomalies of these elements cluster mainly on the southern border of the survey area. Most of the anomalies can be explained in terms of known mineral occurrences The most prominent CH4 anomaly is located south of Moncton and is believed to be due to the old St. Josephs gas and oil field. Several weaker CH4 anomalies are probably generated by swamps and peat bogs.",""

In addition to analyzing the stream sediments by total digestion (multi-acid dissolution with metaborate fusion), we also leached the sediments with 0.25M hydroxylamine hydrochloride (in 0.05M HCl), to determine the REE+Y associated with amorphous Fe- and Mn-oxyhydroxide phases. We are thus able to partition the REE into “dissolved” (<0.45μm), labile (hydroxylamine) and detrital sediment fractions to investigate REE fractionation, and in particular, with respect to the development of Ce and Eu anomalies in oxygenated surface environments. Surface waters are typically LREE depleted ([La/Sm]NASC ranges from 0.16 to 5.84, average=0.604, n=410; where the REE are normalized to the North America Shale Composite), have strongly negative Ce anomalies ([Ce/Ce∗]NASC ranges from 0.02 to 1.25, average=0.277, n=354), and commonly have positive Eu anomalies ([Eu/Eu∗]NASC ranges from 0.295 to 1.77, average=0.764, n=84). In contrast, the total sediment have flatter REE + Y patterns relative to NASC ([La/Sm]NASC ranges from 0.352 to 1.12, average=0.778, n=451) and are slightly middle REE enriched ([Gd/Yb]NASC ranges from 0.55 to 3.75, average=1.42). Most total sediments have negative Ce and Eu anomalies ([Ce/Ce∗]NASC ranges from 0.097 to 2.12, average=0.799 and [Eu/Eu∗]NASC ranges from 0.39 to 1.43, average=0.802). The partial extraction sediments are commonly less LREE depleted than the total sediments ([La/Sm]NASC ranges from 0.24 to 3.31, average=0.901, n=4537), more MREE enriched ([Gd/Yb]NASC ranges from 0.765 to 6.28, average=1.97) and Ce and Eu anomalies (negative and positive) are more pronounced. The partial extraction recovered, on average ∼20% of the Fe in the total sediment, ∼80% of the Mn, and 21–29% of the REEs (Ce=19% and Y=32%). Comparison between REEs in water, partial extraction and total sediment analyses indicates that REEs+Y in the stream sediments have two primary sources, the host lithologies (i.e., mechanical dispersion) and hydromorphically transported (the labile fraction). Furthermore, Eu appears to be more mobile than the other REE, whereas Ce is preferentially removed from solution and accumulates in the stream sediments in a less labile form than the other REEs+Y. Despite poor statistical correlations between the REEs+Y and Mn in either the total sediment or partial extractions, based on apparent distribution coefficients and the pH of the stream waters, we suggest that either sediment organic matter and/or possibly δ-MnO2/FeOOH are likely the predominant sinks for Ce, and to a lesser extent the other REE, in the stream sediments.",""

The interannual analysis of the collected data revealed the existence of strong seasonal fluctuations that present significant deviations from a mean seasonal pattern in specific periods. A general decreasing trend of the salinities of the domain is observed during the study period. At the same time, a strong relation between open Aegean Sea waters and riverine freshwater fluxes is identified, factors that significantly influence stratification, circulation and renewal of the gulf. Based on the thermohaline properties, two dense water formation events (February 2000 and 2005), not previously reported, are detected and analyzed for the first time.","Hydrodynamic circulation,Dense water formation,Physical oceanography,Thermaikos Gulf,Stratification,Freshwater fluxes,"
"aircraft life management using crack initiation and crack growth models – p-3c aircraft experience","2007","In this paper, we present our experience in applying crack initiation and crack growth models to aircraft life predictions and fleet management. The first section of the paper discusses general fleet life assessment methods followed by a description of traditional US Navy method of fleet fatigue life assessment and individual aircraft fatigue tracking. The next section focuses on the history of life estimation methods of P-3C aircraft, with brief descriptions of recently conducted full-scale fatigue test. We then discuss limitations of safe-life methods for aging aircraft such as P-3C and then describe a deterministic total life approach for continued operations beyond crack initiation up to a safe limit using full-scale test as a basis. In the context of crack growth sensitivity to various factors, the need to conduct risk assessment supported by service examples is then presented. Details of risk assessment effort using service data as a basis are briefly described next. Equivalent mathematical formulations for probability of failure analysis are presented with lessons learnt in applying this to field problems. The paper discusses lessons learnt mainly from the standpoints of equivalent initial flaw size distributions, final crack length distributions, and probability of failure calculation methods. The last section of the paper focuses on current crack initiation and crack growth models and their use in aircraft life assessment. Recent coupon test results are used to make general observations about the use of crack initiation and crack growth models. The limitations of applying crack initiation models for different classes of spectrum such as tension dominated and tension–compression type spectrum are then discussed. Similarly, limitations of current crack growth models for application to wide classes of spectra and stress severities are presented. We show the need for calibration of crack growth models when applying to long spectrum histories, using results from recent crack growth coupon tests. The paper concludes with a discussion on the need of better predictive models for both crack initiation and growth for application to a wide variety of aircraft problems.","Strip-yield model,Fatigue critical areas,Tension dominated spectrum,Safe-life,Crack initiation and crack growth models,Full-scale fatigue test,Total life index,Probability of failure,Risk assessment,Local strain approach,Tension–compression spectrum,Damage-tolerance,Aircraft life management,"

"transient wave-blockage interaction in pressurized water pipelines","2014","Transient flows are commonly encountered in pressurized water pipelines and have been studied for the purpose of systems design as well as defects detection and management. The representation and analysis of the transient response in the frequency domain is an attractive approach for fault detection due to its high noise tolerance and the linearized equations allows for the clear analytical characterization of system behaviour. Recent studies have demonstrated that an extended partial constriction of the pipe flow area causes changes in the system resonant frequencies and these changes can be used for locating and sizing partial blockages in pipes. Despite the successful application of this technique under field conditions, so far there is little work on the link between the changes in the system resonant conditions and the wave-blockage interaction. This paper provides a fundamental basis for the observation that unlike localised, discrete blockages, an extended blockage creates changes in the system resonant frequencies. Analytical methods using wave perturbation analysis and transfer matrix are shown in this study, and the obtained results are compared with numerical simulations and experimental data. The analytical analyses are used to explain the blockage-induced frequency shifts and to provide insights for its practical applications in pressurized water pipelines.","transfer matrix,resonant frequency shift,Transients,water pipeline,wave perturbation analysis,wave-blockage interaction,"
"conflictfinder: mining maritime traffic conflict from massive ship trajectories","2017","Collision-free is one of the major safety concerns for maritime traffic management. To analyze the collision data and understand the cause of the collision can contribute the improvement of the maritime traffic safety and management. However, the real collisions is not always available to analyze. Based on a massive AIS trajectory data collected, we focus on mining the ships' movement behaviors those may bring a possible collision if they do not take any avoidance, called Maritime Traffic Conflict. Even though the maritime traffic conflict is a non-accident incident, the movement behaviors of maritime traffic conflict may have the similar behaviors of navigational collision for analysis. Thus, we propose ConflictFinder to provide a framework for maritime traffic conflict mining. Different from existing methods those focus on detecting the conflicts between two ships in a restricted water way, we discover the conflicts occurred by multi-ships in open sea. For analysis of maritime traffic conflicts, a prototype of ConflictFinder is implemented which helps with gaining a better understanding of traffic conflicts discovered and can be applied to the improvement of maritime traffic safety evaluation and management.","AIS Data,data mining,maritime traffic conflict,Safety,Marine vehicles,mining maritime traffic,massive AIS trajectory data,Trajectory Data Mining,massive ship trajectories,ships,collision data analysis,marine safety,maritime traffic safety evaluation,marine engineering,ship movement behaviors,maritime traffic safety management,Prototypes,Artificial intelligence,ConflictFinder,Conflict Detection,Maritime Traffic,Trajectory,navigational collision,restricted water way,open sea,maritime traffic safety,Navigation,Data mining,collision free,"
"synoptic weather conditions and changing fire regimes in a mediterranean environment","2018","Analysis of global change effects on fire regimes requires evaluations of key processes explaining fire activity at the appropriate spatial and temporal scales. Classifications of the weather conditions prevailing at large continental scales (called “Synoptic Weather Types”, SWT) offer convenient potential proxies for integrating weather-related factors into our understanding of fire regime attributes at regional scales. Here we establish a methodology for identifying the major SWT that lead to wildfires and assessing their influence on fire regime in interaction with other global drivers such as drought events or fire suppression policies. Based on days with fires larger than 50 ha that occurred in Catalonia, a region located in the western Mediterranean Basin, we propose a clustering methodology using data of temperature at 850 hPa, sea level pressure and winds at 925 hPa from the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis dataset covering the whole of western Europe (25–70°N and 20°W–40°E). Our classification method proposes 6 SWT: three that were characterized by synoptic conditions leading to strong winds in the region, two that led to ‘hot and dry’ environments, and one that was not characterized by any strong weather determinants. Fires under ‘hot and dry’ conditions, such as the South intrusion SWT, triggered the bulk of fires and burnt area in the region. Spatial analyses of fire distribution under each SWT revealed markedly different fire-prone locations, opening the possibility for strategic planning of fire management based on local fire regimes. Fires occurring during mild years (wet spring conditions) and under ‘hot-and-dry’ SWTs have been eradicated from the region thanks to enhanced firefighting capability, and fire sizes in dry years have strongly reduced. In contrast, fires occurring under windy situations have not followed the same course of change and have not diminished in incidence over time, and seem to be more difficult to control using current fire suppression strategies. The role of SWT on determining fire regimes and its interaction with fire suppression strategies has a huge potential to help researchers and managers develop better fire analyses based on sound physical grounds and serve to understand and eventually regulate the adverse impacts of fire regime changes in a global change context.","Firefighting,Catalonia,Heat-wave,Drought event,Fire size distribution,Wind-driven fire,Kernel density,"
"maritime situational awareness forensics tools for a common information sharing environment (cise)","2019","CISE stands for Common Information Sharing Environment and refers to an architecture and set of protocols, procedures and services for the exchange of data and information across Maritime Authorities of EU (European Union) Member States (MS's). In the context of enabling the implementation and adoption of CISE by different MS's, EU has funded a number of projects that enable the development of subsystems and adaptors intended to allow MS's to connect and make use of CISE. In this context, the Integrated Systems Laboratory (ISL) has led the development of the corresponding Hellenic and Cypriot CISE by developing a Control, Command & Information (C2I) system that unifies all partial maritime surveillance systems into one National Situational Picture Management (NSPM) system, and adaptors that allow the interconnection of the corresponding national legacy systems to CISE and the exchange of data, information and requests between the two MS's. Furthermore, a set of forensics tools that allow geospatial & time filtering and detection of anomalies, risk incidents, fake MMSIs, suspicious speed changes, collision paths, and gaps in AIS (Automatic Identification System), have been developed by combining motion models, AI, deep learning and fusion algorithms using data from different databases through CISE. This paper briefly discusses these developments within the EU CISE-2020, Hellenic CISE and CY-CISE projects and the benefits from the sharing of maritime data across CISE for both maritime surveillance and security.

"touchless and nonverbal human-robot interfaces: an overview of the state-of-the-art","2023","Human-robot interfaces encompass developing technologies that determine how a user interacts with robot systems. Touchless and nonverbal interfaces are a subset of these in which the user can interact with robots without the use of buttons, speech, or other physical methods. The two driving forces behind the development of these methods are the desire for more natural Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) and the need for more efficacious assistive technologies. Many interface methods inspired by natural human interaction can improve HRIs. These include gaze/eye contact, emotion detection, and gesture recognition. Assistive robot systems can efficiently utilize these methods, as well as other interfaces that are uncommon in human interactions. These includes several unexplored methods such as biopotential signals, the electroencephalogram (EEG) being one example. Research is also underway in exploring the use of involuntary or subconscious signals in human interaction, such as lie detection or behavior analysis. This paper compiles research findings in several of these areas and discusses the benefits, limitations, and potential for future development in several essential touchless and nonverbal human-robot interface methods. This includes a discussion of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices as they relate to how robot systems can gather information through the use of sensors. The paper also examines cognitive robots and explores possible advancements that can be explored in this area using next-generation mobile networking (5G and 6G) to allow for high data transfer rates, highlighting important information gathered by robots through different interfacing methods. This leads to several new avenues of future research.","Cognitive robotics,Electroencephalogram,Internet of things,Assistive robots,Human-robot interaction,"

"characterizing rainfall occurrence in india: natural variability and recent trends","2021","A deficit in rainy days can affect crop production and escalate groundwater abstraction leading to groundwater depletion, thus may threaten food and water security in the Indian subcontinent. The available researches on rainfall occurrence in India represent inconsistency in several fundamental considerations (spatial scale of analysis, the definition of rainfall classes, methods, dataset, study period, etc.) and lack of studies for non-monsoon seasons over large parts of the subcontinent. Here we attempt to deal with these inconsistencies by examining space–time patterns in seasonal count of rainfall events and their count in different rainfall classes during 1951–2015 for all meteorological seasons of India using high resolution (0.25°) gridded daily rainfall dataset. The results show a widespread decline in monsoon rainy days over major crop-growing regions including north-central, central, and northeast India. A reduction in rainy days is also observed over parts of central India in premonsoon; over north-central and northeast India in postmonsoon; and over peninsular India in winter. These trends are mainly observed in events with rainfall <95th percentile (light to heavy rainfall events) in all the seasons. Occurrence of extreme events (above 95th and 99th percentile) exhibits contrasting trends over different zones with mainly an increase over central and south-central India and decline over central-north India. However, trends in extremes are highly dispersed in space and are conclusive only over a few regions. The observed trends substantially deviate from the patterns reported in past studies for different regions. Rainfall occurrence in different meteorological zones also represents strong interannual and decadal variability, however, the observed trends have emerged beyond the inherent natural variability. The present findings provide an essential foundation for several future explorations with improved understanding of change in rainfall frequency and its possible impacts. It would also assist in developing a comprehensive framework for year-wide management of water resources and agriculture, considering all crop seasons.","Rainfall frequency,India,Rainy days,Rainfall occurrence,Trend analysis,Rainfall variability,"
"dominant mechanisms for the delivery of fine sediment and phosphorus to fluvial networks draining grassland dominated headwater catchments","2015","Recent advances in monitoring technology have enabled high frequency, in-situ measurements of total phosphorus and total reactive phosphorus to be undertaken with high precision, whilst turbidity can provide an excellent surrogate for suspended sediment. Despite these measurements being fundamental to understanding the mechanisms and flow paths that deliver these constituents to river networks, there is a paucity of such data for headwater agricultural catchments. The aim of this paper is to deduce the dominant mechanisms for the delivery of fine sediment and phosphorus to an upland river network in the UK through characterisation of the temporal variability of hydrological fluxes, and associated soluble and particulate concentrations for the period spanning March 2012–February 2013. An assessment of the factors producing constituent hysteresis is undertaken following factor analysis (FA) on a suite of measured environmental variables representing the fluvial and wider catchment conditions prior to, and during catchment-wide hydrological events. Analysis indicates that suspended sediment is delivered to the fluvial system predominantly via rapidly responding pathways driven by event hydrology. However, evidence of complex, figure-of-eight hysteresis is observed following periods of hydrological quiescence, highlighting the importance of preparatory processes. Sediment delivery via a slow moving, probably sub-surface pathway does occur, albeit infrequently and during low magnitude events at the catchment outlet. Phosphorus is revealed to have a distinct hysteretic response to that of suspended sediment, with sub-surface pathways dominating. However, high magnitude events were observed to exhibit threshold-like behaviour, whereby activation and connection of usually disconnected depositional zones to the fluvial networks results in the movement of vast phosphorus fluxes. Multiple pathways are observed for particulate and soluble constituents, highlighting the challenges faced in mitigating the delivery of contaminant fluxes to headwater river systems.","Connectivity,Grassland,Suspended sediment,Fluvial,Water quality,Phosphorus,Headwater,Diffuse pollution,"

Details of this information is not disclosed until the day of the competition, which adds to the challenges. The algorithm for calculating direction where target signal is coming from is time difference of arrival(TDOA). In order to receive the time difference, we use two hydrophones at two different positions. After getting the time difference, incident angle can be calculated consequently, thus the direction which the target signal is from can be determined.","time-of-arrival estimation,Localization of Underwater Acoustic Source,time 0.5 s,time 2.0 s,maritime RobotX,hydrophones,frequency 25.0 kHz to 40.0 kHz,Oceans,Signal processing,Robots,Time Difference of Arrival,underwater beacon,Logic gates,frequency 0.5 kHz,ambient noise,Underwater acoustics,Sonar equipment,time difference of arrival,target signal,Task analysis,Maritime RobotX,acoustic signal processing,time 1.0 s,multiple reflections,oceanographic techniques,"
"a shift in the diurnal timing and intensity of deep convection over the congo basin during the past 40 years","2021","The Congo Basin, one of the three most convective regions in the world, has recently experienced a large-scale drying trend accompanied by an increase in thunderstorm activity. This study analyzes changes in the diurnal variations of cloudiness and deep convection from 1979 to 2019 over the Congo, evaluates their associations with trends in precipitation efficiency, and explores their possible connections to the observed decrease in precipitation. Analyses of GridSat-B1 and MODIS satellite datasets in conjunction with ERA5 reanalysis data show that cloud cover has decreased, and brightness temperature (Tb) has increased during the morning hours, while convective activity has increased and Tb has decreased during the afternoon hours, possibly due to the observed warming and drying trend over the Congo. The combined effects of decreasing clouds during the morning and the subsequent increasing convection during the afternoon have led to an amplification of the diurnal amplitude in Tb over the Congo. Our results also indicate a decrease in precipitation efficiency and an increase in cloud base height. Such changes may be attributable to the Congo drought as increased surface temperatures and decreased surface relative humidity would raise the lifted condensation level, and thus increase the cloud base height and decrease the precipitation efficiency. This positive-feedback mechanism may ultimately result in the observed decrease of precipitation at the surface, further accelerating the drying trend over the Congo.","Rainfall,Tropical convection,Congo rainforest,Diurnal cycle,"
"designing game methods of educational systems for maritime specialists advanced training","2014","Development of postgraduate education and advanced training assumes the transition of educational theory and practice from the learning paradigm when a person is 'an object of a learning influence' to the paradigm of continuous education when a person is self-developed and self-improved. The process of continuing education and professional development will be effective only in conditions of its controllability that implies the creation of an educational processes management system. Really existing needs in the continuous development of professionalism, self-development and self-improvement of maritime specialists determine the actuality of the adaptive system of continuing education development. The designed system should be based on principles of adaptability (quick responses and changes), integration (for example, into a global educational space), processability, availability, adaptability and dynamism. The practical realization of these principles suggests that the system has a high potential of self-improvement and improvement through the integration of new high-tech modules into the existing system. Since the continuing education system must respond quickly to changes in external and internal conditions it is necessary to adapt it to new conditions. This is possible when scientific and pedagogical staff of the university is ready to the project activity. In this regard the teachers' training for such activities is the relevant issue. There are situations of 'conflict' of interest during games as in real life and teachers of different subjects must search a compromise that satisfies basic learning goals. During the game, participants consider many variants for solving certain project tasks, methods of training schemes designing. Such schemes have to take into account the diversity of systems ties and factors influencing educational processes. It is very important in the sphere of maritime specialists training. Participants are often faced with a lack of methodological training that is an important motivating factor for self-development and new knowledge.

"chemostratigraphy: a method to improve interwell correlation in barren sequences — a case study using onshore duckmantian/stephanian sequences (west midlands, u.k.)","1999","Chemostratigraphy has been applied to onshore Duckmantian/Stephanian successions encountered in outcrop and penetrated by two boreholes from the West Midlands (U.K.). These successions represent the onshore equivalents of the `Barren Red Measures' which are important hydrocarbon-bearing sequences in the Southern North Sea. Much is known about the onshore successions in terms of sedimentology, mineralogy and provenance and thus they provide the ideal test for the validity of chemostratigraphy as a stratigraphic tool. Reliable inorganic geochemical data have been acquired from geochemical analyses of core, sidewall core and cuttings samples, with 19 elements being determined. Stratigraphic variations in elemental concentrations are compared with known variations in the mineralogical data. The established lithostratigraphic units of the Duckmantian/Stephanian intervals can also be recognized from the geochemical data and by using these data can be subdivided further. This results in an independent chemostratigraphic correlation being established for the two boreholes, which has been assessed statistically by discriminant function analysis. From the geochemical and mineralogical data, distinct changes in provenance are identified within the Upper Carboniferous successions. The sediments of the Coal Measures were derived from a north westerly and westerly source (?Caledonian), whereas the Etruria Formation sediments came from the Wales Brabant Massif, the sediments having mixed Caledonian and Cadomian characteristics. Eventually these sediments were replaced by sediments from a southern Hercynian source (Halesowen and Salop Formations).","chemostratigraphy,Upper Carboniferous,correlation,provenance,"

"a multicriteria model for personnel selection in maritime industry in greece","2017","The quality of staff is of paramount importance in all businesses. However, in maritime industry it is crucial due to the nature of the business itself. Employees' lives could be exposed to risk, let alone that huge assets are in stake, if poor decisions are made. Employing quality and professional human resources requires a personnel selection process that would evaluate the best suited personnel, dealing with the consideration of both qualitative and quantitative criteria. However, despite the significance of the maritime industry worldwide, research is needed in order to investigate the criteria upon which maritime management could rely when selecting their human resources. This paper aims at developing a multi-criteria model for personnel selection in the maritime industry, based on the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), chosen for its ability to incorporate multiple subjective opinions into a solid decision model. A novel criteria ranking technique based on Correspondence Analysis (CA) was added to the process in order to select the most highly evaluated criteria through a powerful data-driven method which does not rely on a-priori scales. Data was collected by interviewing experts from 14 maritime companies in Greece. The resulting model was validated by comparing its results against previous cases of successful employment. The results indicate that criteria such as trustworthiness, responsibility, capabilities in decision making, team spirit and communication skills are among the most important traits that companies look for.","analytic hierarchy process,multicriteria selection model,qualitative criteria,criteria ranking technique,data-driven method,Correspondence Analysis,Personnel,Industries,Companies,human resource management,solid decision model,personnel selection,Maritime industry,Analytic hierarchy process,correspondence analysis,data collection,professional human resources,personnel,Greece,Analytic Hierarchy Process,quantitative criteria,AHP,maritime industry,maritime management,personnel selection process,multicriteria model,Analytical models,"

W-band is characterized by scintillations caused by subtle aspect and range changes, making classification potentially problematic. High resolution range profiles (HRRPs) were used as the feature vectors with minimal pre-processing. Training and test datasets were generated by rotating the targets in the azimuth plane. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was conducted, as well as precision, recall, and accuracy measures derived, and confusion matrices obtained for each classifier under a specific operating point. It was found that the traditional correlation approach performed best under the given circumstances, closely followed by the two SVM approaches and naÃ¯ve Bayes.

"velocity estimation of maritime targets in spaceborne single-channel sar images: methods and performance assessment","2023","High-resolution images provided by satellite Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) systems are of great interest for maritime surveillance applications. As ship targets can be characterized by complex motions, they usually appear defocused in level-1 SAR images. Previous works have shown the effectiveness of the applications of Inverse SAR (ISAR) techniques to refocus the images of such targets. Apart from achieving well-focused images, also the knowledge of ship velocity is strategic information for surveillance. Therefore, in this work, we analyze the capability of ISAR techniques to estimate the ship translational motion: to this purpose, two different autofocus approaches are considered and compared, one based on the image contrast and the other on the phase gradient algorithm. Achievable performances are analyzed by means of Cosmo-SkyMed data and exploiting the Automatic Identification System (AIS) information as the reference ground truth.","Satellites,level-1 SAR images,complex motions,Automatic Identification System information,high-resolution images,performance assessment,image resolution,Marine vehicles,achievable performances,radar interferometry,ships,ship targets,synthetic aperture radar,maritime targets,well-focused images,ship translational motion,radar imaging,Artificial intelligence,Radar polarimetry,satellite Synthetic Aperture Radar systems,spaceborne single-channel SAR images,velocity estimation,maritime surveillance applications,spaceborne radar,image contrast,Surveillance,Inverse SAR techniques,Spaceborne radar,ship velocity,Estimation,remote sensing by radar,ISAR techniques,"
"learning motion patterns in ais data and detecting anomalous vessel behavior","2021","A new approach to anomaly detection in maritime traffic based on Automatic Identification System (AIS) data is proposed. The method recursively learns a model of the nominal vessel routes from AIS data and simultaneously estimates the current state of the vessels. A distinction between anomalies and measurement outliers is made and a method to detect and distinguish between the two is proposed. The anomaly and outlier detection is based on statistical testing relative to the current motion model. The proposed method is evaluated on historical AIS data from a coastal area in Sweden and is shown to detect previously unseen motions.","Outlier Detection,maritime traffic,Anomaly detection,automatic identification system data,Anomaly Detection,Conferences,Sea measurements,outlier detection,ships,statistical testing,Marine Safety,current motion model,Data models,traffic information systems,Artificial intelligence,Sweden,Statistical analysis,marine engineering computing,anomalous vessel behavior detection,Current measurement,learning (artificial intelligence),motion pattern learning,historical AIS data,data handling,"
"estimates of tidal mixing in the indonesian archipelago from multidisciplinary indomix in-situ data","2015","The Indonesian Mixing program (INDOMIX) was designed to quantify the very strong mixing that transforms Pacific waters into isohaline Indonesian Waters in the Indonesian archipelago. The turbulent dissipation rates and associated mixing were estimated and analyzed using a multidisciplinary approach that combines physical and geochemical in-situ observations: (1) direct measurements of the dissipation using a microstructure profiler, (2) use of density-based fine-scale methods applied to CTD and XCTD data, and (3) study of the vertical distribution of natural radionuclides (radium isotopes and actinium-227). Data were collected at five contrasting stations within the Indonesian archipelago, found above energetic straits or in relatively quiescent large basins. Strong instabilities, inversions of the density profiles and a very strong water mass transformation were observed. A wide range of dissipation values were obtained (between [10−10, 10−4]Wkg−1) with spots of higher dissipation in the ocean interior correlated with a strong internal tide signal. Both the fine-scale and micro-scale methods allow us to identify very strong energy dissipation levels above the straits, ranging between [10−7, 10−4]Wkg−1, in contrast to lower values at stations further away from the generation sites. The dissipation for the station located in the center of the Halmahera Sea ([10−9, 10−8]Wkg−1) is stronger than for the Banda station ([10−11, 10−10]Wkg−1), which is even further away from the generation sites. The three approaches agree relatively well and provide vertical eddy diffusivities values ranging between 5×10−4 and 5×10−1m2s−1, except in the Banda Sea where values are similar to the ones found in the open ocean (10−6m2s−1). CTD and XCTD profilers (deployed between stations) give estimates of dissipation all along the transit. It is found that enhanced mixing occurs preferentially above rough topography, such as in the Ombai Strait, the Halmahera Sea’s northern entrance, the Buru strait and Sumba strait. Finestructure parameters are very sensitive to depth and dissipation, which differs between stations. We recommend more systematic microstructure measurement in order to tune these parameters. Surface mixing, at the base of the mixed layer is found to be very strong with values between [10−4, 10−3m2s−1]. These results confirm the modeling studies that suggest the occurrence of intensified subsurface mixing which cools the sea surface temperatures and thus strongly affects the mean and variability of the tropical climate. We conclude, therefore, that climate models need to take into account this intensified ocean mixing to properly represent the mean state of the atmosphere and its climate variability.","Vertical mixing,Microstructure,Internal tides,Natural radionuclides,Finestructure,Indonesian seas,"

"design of a decision support system to achieve condition-based maintenance in ship machinery systems","2023","A decision support system is proposed for the condition-based maintenance of ship machinery systems based on the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) approach. A case study is conducted for a container ship's main diesel engine. Within the scope of the methodology, the main engine power is predicted based on exhaust gas outlet temperatures of cylinders and the main engine shaft RPM. In this regard, firstly, two different strategies such as the creation of the cylinder-basis model and the development of the overall system model are developed to determine the ANFIS model structure for the analysis. Then, comparative analyses are carried out to select a suitable ANFIS structure and its specific membership functions. In addition, the estimation process is also performed by the artificial neural network (ANN) model, and its results are compared with the findings of the best ANFIS structure. The success of the constructed models is evaluated by some error metrics. The overall ANFIS model with 5 membership functions is determined as the best approach by scores of 0.9806 for R2, 1.6588 MW for RMSE, and 3.2703 for MAPE. As a result of the estimation procedure, a decision support system to assist marine operators in maintenance operations is developed. The proposed strategy can be applied to different types of systems in the ship engine room such as the fuel oil system and can be improved by including more parameters obtained from the system's significant points in the analysis.","Anomaly detection,Ship machinery system,ANN,Condition-based maintenance,Maintenance,ANFIS,"

Firstly, a robust and accurate data association between Syn-thetic Aperture Radar (SAR) ship detections and AIS data is carried out on multi-temporal SAR imagery and AIS data. Subsequently, Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) is applied to unassigned SAR ship detections to reveal the spatial distri-bution of â€˜darkâ€™ zones (i.e. areas where repeated unassign-ments occur). This analysis helps identify areas where ships frequently do not report, which can help guide authorities in the best way to respond.

Adopting a geoarchaeological approach, the combination of sedimentological, palynological, and geophysical data enables the reconstruction of various stages in the landscape evolution of the Lower Sagone River over the last 4000years, together with the history of human occupation. The methods consist of a palaeoenvironmental study of 9 boreholes drilled in the modern deltaic plain, at a maximum distance of 500m from the present-day shoreline. The laboratory analyses included mollusk identification and measurements of the grain-size distribution (by wet sieving). A series of 21 radiocarbon dates on charcoal, plant remains, wood fragments, and marine mollusk samples formed the basis for a chronostratigraphy. In order to reconstruct the vegetation history of the catchment, with particular attention to anthropogenic activity, pollen analysis was conducted on clay samples from the deepest borehole, and they revealed a semi-open forest during the Bronze Age and Late Iron Age with extensive pastoral activity and limited cereal cultivation. Electric Resistivity Tomography (ERT) of 3 profiles across the alluvial plain was conducted in order to reveal the geometry of the sedimentary bodies. The salient features are the presence of a freshwater lake during the Mid- to Late Bronze Age (from 1500 to 1100cal. BCE), its transformation into an open marine bay from ca. 1100 until 500cal.

"review and analysis of methods for assessing maritime waterway risk based on non-accident critical events detected from ais data","2020","The safe navigation of ships is of high societal concern. A promising approach for analyzing waterway risks is using non-accident critical events as surrogate indicators of collision accidents. These are typically detected in data from the Automatic Identification System (AIS). Recognizing the significant interest in this approach, this article provides a review and analysis of methods based on the detection of non-accident critical events from AIS data, which aim to provide insight into maritime waterway risk. Considering also recent calls for increased focus on foundational issues in risk research and safety science, each method in the literature is critically reviewed based on five questions: How are non-accident critical events defined? What is the accident-theoretical basis of the method? How are non-accident critical events ranked? How is the method used? To what extent has the method been validated? Based on the results, it is concluded that focus is needed to build evidence of the validity of the models’ results, if these are to be effectively used for waterway risk analysis. As a prerequisite, more focus is needed on how exactly non-accident critical events are defined, and what factors are involved in the relation between their occurrence and accident involvement.","Non-accident critical event,Maritime safety,AIS data,Accident theory,Validation,"

"ttmrn: a topological-geometric two-layer maritime route network modeling for ship intelligent navigation","2023","The construction of maritime route networks holds significant importance for autonomous navigation of vessels. In this study, a two-layer maritime route network modeling method based on huge amounts of ship trajectory data was proposed. Firstly, we introduce a novel method for extracting nodes of the marine route network, which identifies feature points in ship trajectories through clustering. Secondly, we use a spatial computing method to transform ship trajectory data into a sequence of waypoint regions and establish a node connection matrix to realize the nodes' connection of the topological layer route network. And routes are extracted between waypoint regions to characterize the connection relationship of the geometric layer network. Finally, by connecting nodes of the topological layer with the support of the connection matrix and waypoint regions of the geometric layer with the route, the two-layer maritime route network that combines topological and geometric layers is constructed. The proposed method was applied to the waters of Vancouver, successfully constructing a topological-geometric two-layer maritime route network. Overall, the proposed method is beneficial for improving the safety and efficiency of autonomous navigation of ships, and has a positive impact on the development of smart shipping industry.","Trajectory feature points,Intelligent navigation,Cluster analysis,Maritime route network,AIS data,"
"influence of the geomagnetic field on the iact detection technique for possible sites of cta observatories","2013","We investigate the influence of the geomagnetic field (GF) on the Imaging Air Cherenkov Telescope technique for two northern (Tenerife and San Pedro Martir) and three southern (Salta, Leoncito and Namibia (the H.E.S.S.-site)) site candidates for Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) observatories. We use the CORSIKA and sim_telarray programs for Monte Carlo simulations of gamma ray showers, hadronic background and the telescope response. We focus here on gamma ray measurements in the low energy, sub-100GeV, range. Therefore, we only consider the performance of arrays of several large telescopes. Neglecting the GF effect, we find (in agreement with previous studies) that such arrays have lower energy thresholds, and larger collection areas below 30GeV, when located at higher altitudes. We point out, however, that in the considered ranges of altitudes and magnetic field intensities, 1800–3600m a.s.l. and 0–40μT, respectively, the GF effect has a similar magnitude to this altitude effect. We provide the trigger-level performance parameters of the observatory affected by the GF effect, in particular the collection areas, detection rates and the energy thresholds for all five locations, which information may be useful in the selection of sites for CTA. We also find simple scaling of these parameters with the magnetic field strength, which can be used to assess the magnitude of the GF effect for other sites; in this work we use them to estimate the performance parameters for five sites: South Africa-Beaufort West, USA-Yavapai Ranch, Namibia-Calapanzi, Chile-La Silla and India-Hanle. We roughly investigate the impact of the geophysical conditions on gamma/hadron separation procedures involving image shape and direction cuts. We note that the change of altitude has an opposite effect at the trigger and analysis levels, i.e. gains in triggering efficiency at higher altitudes are partially balanced by losses in the separation efficiency. In turn, a stronger GF spoils both the shape and the direction discrimination of gamma rays, thus its effects at the trigger and analysis levels add up resulting in a significant reduction of the observatory performance. Overall, our results indicate that the local GF strength at a site can be equally important as its altitude for the low-energy performance of CTA.","Cherenkov light,Imaging Air Cherenkov technique,Monte Carlo simulations,CTA observatory project,Cherenkov detectors,Geomagnetic field,Extensive Air Shower,"

Lightning strokes measured by a lightning detection network, human thunderstorm observations at weather stations and convective cells derived from radar reflectivity are used. The analysis reveals conditions favourable for thunderstorm development and highlights regions affected under different flow regimes. Additionally, the cell-based analysis shows that different synoptic conditions are typically associated with specific cell characteristics, such as the direction and speed of movement or cell sizes and severity. These relationships can be explained meaningfully via a description of the synoptic-meteorological characteristics of each of the standard weather patterns. As such these results may support a better understanding of thunderstorm formation as well as improve forecasters' situational awareness.","Climatology,Thunderstorm,Automatic classification,Synoptic conditions,"
"pointer years in tree-ring width and earlywood-vessel area time series of quercus robur—relation with climate factors near its northern distribution limit","2013","For a long time, radial growth of pedunculate oak (Quercus robur) in relation to environmental factors has been studied in Central Europe. However, there is insufficient information on oak growth in the Baltic region. Climate–growth interactions have been mostly investigated by correlation/response analysis between ring width and climatic factors. Other wood anatomical proxies, and also pointer year analysis, which focuses on weather extremes, can be sources of additional information. Wood samples were taken from 40 sites across Latvia. Tree-ring width (TRW) and mean area of earlywood vessels (EVA) were measured. To assess differences in wood formation among sites, a PCA was performed based on pointer year series of TRW and EVA per site. The relation with climate was assessed by Pearson's correlation. Patterns of wood formation differed along west/east gradient, so that two regions (western and eastern) of Latvia were distinguished. Pointer year values were higher for TRW than for EVA and higher in the eastern than in the western region. However, the pointer year values were moderate, suggesting that there was no strict limiting factor for their formation. Pointer years of EVA were strongly related with temperature during the dormant period in both regions; June precipitation had a significant effect in the eastern region. Pointer years of TRW were correlated with spring and summer temperature in the western region and with February temperature in the eastern region; precipitation in autumn showed a negative effect. These differences can be explained by a gradient from maritime to continental climate, leading to shifts in the growth limiting factors. Extremely cold winters resulted in most of the negative pointer years of TRW and EVA.","Tree-rings,Climate,Pointer years,Vessels,Oak,Latvia,"

Within this work we exploit the over 20-year data record from NASA EOS satellites to investigate the degree to which space-borne observations can detect shifts in known eruption dynamics at Kīlauea. Through the combined analysis of remotely sensed plume heights, plume particle microphysical properties, lava flow thermal tracking and high resolution SO2 mapping, we provide interpretations of the satellite signals in a volcanic context and link them to ground-based eruption reports for validation. We establish common patterns of plume dispersion and particle evolution and identify when significant shifts in activity occur. We also determine where ambient conditions influence the output retrieved from the space-borne sensors. By comparing the inferences derived from remote-sensing with the extensive record of suborbital observations at Kīlauea, we assess the strengths and limitations of the satellite-based volcanic assessment techniques. The work presented here highlights the capabilities of these techniques, allowing us to more confidently interpret volcanic activity observed from space globally, particularly in cases where ground observations are limited or entirely lacking.","Eruption tracking,Volcano remote sensing,Kīlauea,NASA earth observing system,TROPOMI,MODIS,MISR,"

Atmospheric optical depth data retrieved by MODIS on board Aqua satellite and cloud to ground lightning activity data provided by ZEUS network operated by the National Observatory of Athens were analyzed for a time period spanning from 01/01/2005 up to 31/12/2013. The results indicate the importance of aerosols in lightning modulation. The mean aerosol optical depth (AOD) values of the days with lightning activity were found to be higher than the mean seasonal AOD in 90% of the under study domain. Furthermore, the increasing rate of lightning activity with increasing aerosol loading was found to be more pronounced during summertime and for AOD values up to 0.4. Additionally, the spatial analysis showed that the percentage of days with lightning activity during summertime is increasing with increasing AOD. Finally, time series showed similar temporal behavior between AOD seasonal anomalies and days with lightning activity differences. Both the spatial and temporal analysis showed that lightning activity is correlated to AOD, a characteristic consistent for all seasons.","Mediterranean Sea,ZEUS lightning detection network,Lightning,Aerosol atmospheric optical depth,MODIS,"
"a wideband satellite maritime channel model simulator","2022","In this article, we present implementation details of a generative satellite maritime propagation channel model at L-band. In an earlier paper, we presented the parameterization of the channel model for the narrowband case based on recordings of GPS L1  $C/N_{0}$  time-series in different sea state conditions. Additionally, we performed wider band measurements using GPS E5a (â‰ˆ10 Mcpsâ€”chips per secondâ€” > 20 MHz bandwidth) and obtained estimations of power delay profiles. Due to lack of dynamic range and delay resolution, in these measurements, no conclusive information was gathered on the time spreading caused by the channel. What was clear is that the time spreading was not significant outside the first signal chip, i.e.,  $\approx 0.1~\mu \text{s}$ . Still wideband modeling is required within this spreading range. Now, we want to extend the model to the wideband case. To achieve this goal, we have used a rough surface scattering model applicable to sea surfaces and employed it to characterize the time dispersion to be expected. Additionally, we also used this scattering model to help verify the validity of the existing Doppler spread model. Furthermore, ship movements in the waves play a role. We try and analyze this issue.

"detection of aeromagnetic anomaly change associated with volcanic activity: an application of the generalized mis-tie control method","2009","Repeat aeromagnetic surveys may assist in mapping and monitoring long-term changes associated with volcanic activity. However, when dealing with repeat aeromagnetic survey data, the problem of how to extract the real change of magnetic anomalies from a limited set of observations arises, i.e. the problem of spatial aliasing. Recent development of the generalized mis-tie control method for aeromagnetic surveys flown at variable elevations enables us to statistically extract the errors from ambiguous noise sources. This technique can be applied to overcome the spatial alias effect when detecting magnetic anomaly changes between aeromagnetic surveys flown at different times. We successfully apply this technique to Asama Volcano, one of the active volcanoes in Japan, which erupted in 2004. Following the volcanic activity in 2005, we conducted a helicopter-borne aeromagnetic survey, which we compare here to the result from a previous survey flown in 1992. To discuss small changes in magnetic anomalies induced by volcanic activity, it is essential to estimate the accuracy of the reference and the repeat aeromagnetic measurements and the probable errors induced by data processing. In our case, the positioning inaccuracy of the 1992 reference survey was the most serious factor affecting the estimation of the magnetic anomaly change because GPS was still in an early stage at that time. However, our analysis revealed that the magnetic anomaly change over the Asama Volcano area from 1992 to 2005 exceeded the estimated error at three locations, one of which is interpreted as a loss of magnetization induced by volcanic activity. In this study, we suffered from the problem of positioning inaccuracy in the 1992 survey data, and it was important to evaluate its effect when deriving the magnetic anomaly change.","Magnetic anomaly change,V olcanic activity,Aeromagnetic anomalies,Asama Volcano,Mis-tie control method,"

"energy-efficient task offloading of edge-aided maritime uav systems","2023","This paper considers the autonomous detecting and tracking task of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in the maritime environment. Due to the high computational complexity of the image-processing task, the strict latency requirement of the tracking task, and the shortage of batteries and computational capability of UAVs, the UAVs can offload the computing-intensive task to the edge computing server (ECS) to reduce the task latency and energy consumption. Even though, the large latency and energy consumption brought by some high-definition image-processing task still make some visual tracking difficult to perform. We first investigate the impact of video frame resolution on computing task size and detection accuracy, and further on task latency and energy consumption. In addition, we optimize the transmission power, the local CPU frequency, the offloading rate of UAVs, and the bandwidth allocation between UAVs. We model the UAVs tracking system as an energy consumption optimization problem with the constraint of task latency. Although the proposed optimization problem is complex, we transform the optimization problem into several subproblems with decoupling and rigorous mathematical proof.

"a multi-task learning-based framework for global maritime trajectory and destination prediction with ais data","2022","Automatic Identification System (AIS) was initially developed for tracking ships and avoiding collisions. As numerous small satellites were launched in recent years, millions of AIS messages are captured by these satellite AIS providers every day. The massive amount of data allow shipping firms and port operators to better predict vessels’ movement. In this study, a computational framework is developed to predict future trajectories and destinations of vessels by applying deep learning to the satellite AIS messages containing self-reporting positioning data. We employed deep learning approaches for large-scale maritime prediction and identifies the most suitable deep neural networks for this specific application. Three prediction models, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Dense Neural Networks (DNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) have been tested in the framework. A multi-task learning architecture is implemented based on test results. Through sharing parameters while training, this architecture enables long-term destination predictions by balancing short-term trajectory predictions. The framework is validated globally with the experiments covering five large-scale sea areas. The experimental results demonstrate that the LSTM model with an average accuracy percentage of 85.1% outperforms the CNN and DNN with accuracy percentages of 68.3% and 78.2% respectively. The LSTM model with multi-task architecture can achieve an accuracy of 87.0%.

"vessel manoeuvring hot zone recognition and traffic analysis with ais data","2022","Automatic identification systems (AIS) are on-board compulsory devices on ships that can provide a large amount of dynamic vessel information, such as position, course and speed information, which is meaningful for marine management. This paper explores the potential to utilize AIS data to recognize ship manoeuvring hot zones and analyse their characteristics to improve marine management efficiency. First, considering manoeuvring behaviours such as turning, acceleration and deceleration, a novel approach based on MiniBatchKMeans that recognizes ship turning hot zones, acceleration hot zones and deceleration hot zones is proposed according to course and speed variation. Second, joint probability density functions for speed over ground (SOG) and course over ground (COG) are built taking into account the combined influences of motion characteristics, which are beneficial for determining the ship traffic rules in manoeuvring hot zones and utilized in marine management. Finally, numerical and comparison experiments are conducted to test the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method.","Vessel manoeuvring,Cluster,AIS,Hot zone,Joint probability density function,"
"non-stationary statistical modelling of wind speed: a case study in eastern canada","2021","The assessment of wind energy potential is generally based on the analysis of the statistical distribution of observed wind speed of short time resolution. Record periods of observational data used in practice at sites of interest are often very short, often ranging from a few months to a few years. Predictions based on such small record periods are likely to be biased as it is recognized that wind speed is subject to important interannual variability and long-term trends. Large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns have an important influence on wind speed. Their predictable nature can make them useful for the prediction of wind speed during the lifetime of wind farm projects. This feature is not exploited in practice. It is proposed in this study to introduce predictors of the wind speed in non-stationary statistical models. This approach allows the development of predictions of the wind speed distribution conditionally on the state of the predictors. The predictors used here are indices of atmospheric circulation to account for the interannual variability and a temporal index to account for the long-term temporal trend. The proposed approach was applied to hourly wind speed data at selected meteorological stations in the province of Québec (Canada). 20 stations with long record periods of over 30 years of data were used. The most important circulation indices identified in the study area are the North-Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) during the winter season and the Pacific North American (PNA) during the spring season. Results indicate that the annual goodness-of-fit at the stations of the case study improved on average when the non-stationary model is used compared to the stationary model. The proposed approach can potentially be used to model wind speed during the projected lifetime of wind farms using forecasts of the predictors.","Probability density function,Climate oscillation indices,Non-stationary model,Wind speed,Wind Energy,Climate variability,"

"maritime situation analysis: a multi-vessel interaction and anomaly detection framework","2014","Maritime security is critical for protecting sea lanes, ports, harborsand other critical infrastructure against a broad range of threats and illegal activities like smuggling, human trafficking, piracy and terrorism. Limited resources constrain maritime domain awareness and compromise full security coverage at all times. This situation calls for innovative intelligent systems for interactive situation analysis to assist marine authorities and security personal in their routine surveillance operations. In this paper, we propose a novel situation analysis approach to analyze, detect and differentiate a range of interaction patterns and anomalies of interest for marine vessels that operate over some period of time in relative proximity to each other. We analyze vessel interaction scenarios to model common patterns as probabilistic processes in terms of hidden Markov models.

"maritime dc power system with generation topology consisting of combination of permanent magnet generator and diode rectifier","2020","The dc grid is emerging as a new electric power distribution concept for several types of vessels due to its higher fuel efficiency compared with the conventional ac grid. Until today, wound rotor generators (WRGs) and diode rectifiers have been applied to the generation part of the onboard dc grid although the efficiency, weight, reliability, and footprint of the WRGs are inferior to those of permanent magnet generators (PMGs). In this article, the possibility of adopting the PMG in the onboard dc grid instead of the WRG is studied. According to the analysis, even though the PMG is inherently incapable of adjusting rotor flux, the rectified dc voltage can be controlled in a certain range under all load conditions. Simultaneously, the diesel engine can be controlled near its optimal operating line (OOL) to minimize fuel consumption. The controllability of the rectified dc voltage of the PMG is verified by computer simulation and small-scaled experimental tests. When comparing the operating trace of the proposed system to the specific fuel oil consumption (SFOC) map of a 350-kW diesel engine, i.e., AD158TI, the fuel-saving by applying the PMG is expected to be more than 10% at light load condition and around 3% average in overall operating conditions.","rectifiers,integrated power system (IPS),small-scaled experimental tests,Generators,Voltage control,DC grid,permanent magnet generators,machine control,diesel-electric generators,diesel engine,optimal control,Reliability,power grids,power generation control,rotors,PMG,OOL,wound rotor generators,computer simulation,specific fuel oil consumption,magnetic flux,dc microgrid,onboard dc grid,SFOC,rotor flux,optimal operating line,diode rectifier,Rectifiers,Diesel engines,rectified dc voltage control,engine variable speed drive,electric propulsion,maritime DC power system,permanent magnet generator,fuel economy,electric power distribution,marine power systems,diesel engines,voltage control,power distribution control,energy consumption,Permanent magnet generators,permanent magnet generator (PMG),WRG,Fuels,"

"a probabilistic risk approach for the collision detection of multi-ships under spatiotemporal movement uncertainty","2021","It is vital to analyse ship collision risk for preventing collisions and improving safety at sea. The state-of-the-art of ship collision risk analysis focuses on encountering conflict between ship pairs, subject to a strong assumption of the ships having no/little spatiotemporal motion uncertainty. This paper proposes a probabilistic conflict detection approach to estimate potential collision risk of various multi-vessel encounters, in which the spatiotemporal-dependent patterns of ship motions are newly taken into account through quantifying the trajectory uncertainty distributions using AIS data. The estimation accuracy and efficiency are assured by employing a two-stage Monte Carlo simulation algorithm, which provides the quantitative bounds on the approximation accuracy and allows for a fast estimation of conflict criticality. Several real experiments are conducted using the AIS-based trajectory data in Ningbo-Zhoushan Port to demonstrate the feasibility and superiority of the proposed new approach. The results show that it enables the effective detection of collision risk timely and reliably in a complicated dynamic situation. They therefore provide valuable insights on ship collision risk prediction as well as the formulation of risk mitigation measures.","Multi-ship spatiotemporal movements,Ship collision risk,Probabilistic conflict detection,Maritime safety,AIS data,Uncertainty time-dependent analysis,"

In the new methodology, the topological and evolutionary characteristics of ship traffic networks and the uncertainty in ship movements are considered simultaneously to realise probabilistic collision detection. The methodology, through the effective integration of probabilistic conflict estimation and traffic complexity modelling and assessment, enables the evaluation of traffic complexity in a fine-grained hierarchical manner. With the AIS-based trajectory data collected from the world’s largest port (i.e. Ningbo-Zhoushan Port), a thorough validation of the evaluation performance is conducted and demonstrated through scenario analysis and model robustness. Moreover, some critical research results are obtained in terms of traffic network heterogeneity analysis; statistics including occurrence frequency, temporal distribution, life cycle, and transition probability of traffic complexity patterns; and correlation examination between the number of ships and traffic complexity patterns.

The proximity-based IoT service is a type of service that becomes available once an IoT object comes near other objects.

"effect of smart meter data collection frequency in an early detection of shorter-duration voltage anomalies in smart grids","2019","Smart grids are required to respond quickly and efficiently to any types of electrical incidents. This is possible only if advanced monitoring and decision support tools are available for the operators to collect and analyze the real-time data from the entire power system. Sensors and smart meters become necessary for an effective smart grid operation, as they can play a significant role in measuring system parameters such as the temperature of the transmission line, power outages and power usage. These sensors allow communication between the generation side and user side to ensure full network observability. Hence, the volume of data which needs to be analyzed for more reliable electrical services has been increased. Upon the analysis of all the data collected, useful insights can be gained to bring benefits to the utilities, consumers and the related organizations. In this project, the effect of smart meter data collection frequencies on the early detection of short-duration voltage anomalies has been investigated. An anomaly detection algorithm that analyzes the voltages collected from smart meters is developed. The proposed anomaly detector checks the normality of the voltage data collected from the smart meters installed at the residential loads. To test the effectiveness of the frequent-and-large smart meter data, a smart grid model was simulated in MATLAB/Simulink and the model was tested under three different operating conditions. The efficacy of the anomaly detector with the smart meter data collected at different data collection intervals was compared under the three operating conditions. The investigation of the smart meter data clearly shows that the shorter-duration anomalies can be detected effectively with more frequent data and hence it reveals the potential of smart meters in the early detection of short-duration anomalies in smart grids.","Smart devices,Anomaly detection system,Photovoltaic system,Large data,Smart grid,"

"automatic fault detection in seismic data using gaussian process regression","2019","Compartmentalization of hydrocarbon reservoirs, change in fluid contacts, effects of high permeable fractures around faults, and hydrocarbon traps created by seal faults make fault detection and extraction as a necessity in the analysis of seismic data. Faulting disrupts the smoothness trend of geological layers (reflections in seismic sections) and displaces layers along its plane. Thus, a fault could be considered as an abnormal phenomenon that globally deviates normal behavior of layers around its plane. In the present study, faults are considered as sparse global anomalies in a seismic section that can be extracted using Gaussian process regression. The Gaussian process regression is a nonparametric probabilistic model based on Bayesian statistics that can be used to model spatial properties as a regression problem. The Gaussian process usually is used to extract and describe normal interactions from the data set using smooth functions. The main idea of this study is to detect the global anomaly using Gaussian process regression. For this purpose, we considered geological layers as smooth normal events in seismic sections. Therefore, the location of the fault plane is where the Gaussian process gets an error during describing the layers. Abnormalities such as faults cause the Gaussian process to suffer an error near the anomaly. We used these errors and analyzed them to detect probable locations of fault edge. Finally, we used a consistent connection algorithm to separate most probable fault points and to connect them to an edge using morphological reconstruction algorithm. The proposed algorithm was evaluated based on the receiver operating characteristics analysis. Several synthetic seismic sections with different levels of signal to noise ratios were used to evaluate the algorithm in the presence of random noise. The results showed that all points predicted by a diagnostic test fell into the area above the diagonal of the receiver operating characteristics space, which represents a good diagnostic classification.","Global anomaly detection,Gaussian process regression,Fault,Reconstruction morphology,"
"the aleutian low, storm tracks, and winter climate variability in the bering sea","2007","Previous studies have found inconsistent results regarding how wintertime conditions in the Bering Sea relate to variations in the North Pacific climate system. This problem is addressed through analysis of data from the NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis for the period 1950–2003. Composite patterns of sea-level pressure, 500hPa geopotential heights, storm tracks and surface air temperature are presented for four situations: periods of strong Aleutian Low, weak Aleutian Low, warm Bering Sea air temperatures, and cold Bering Sea air temperatures. Winter temperatures in the Bering Sea are only marginally related to the strength of the Aleutian Low, and are much more sensitive to the position of the Aleutian Low and to variations in storm tracks. In particular, relatively warm temperatures are associated with either an enhanced storm track off the coast of Siberia, and hence anomalous southerly low-level flow, or an enhanced storm track entering the eastern Bering Sea from the southeast. These latter storms do not systematically affect the mean meridional winds, but rather serve to transport mild air of maritime origin over the Bering Sea. The leading indices for the North Pacific, such as the NP and PNA, are more representative of the patterns of tropospheric circulation and storm track anomalies associated with the strength of the Aleutian Low than patterns associated with warm and cold wintertime conditions in the Bering Sea.","Aleutian Low,Winds,Storm tracks,North Pacific,Bering Sea,Climate variability,"
"assessment of the impact of fouling on vessel energy efficiency by analyzing ship automation data","2020","Shipbuilding and shipping areas are technically dependent to each other since shipping is the end user in the shipbuilding industry. One of the biggest maritime challenges arose due to regulations about emissions and has begun to be a worldwide concern. The maritime industry has enormous potential in terms of a reduction in energy use and emission supervision, especially with respect to existing ships. The specific challenges to shipping are energy inefficiency and emissions; vessel electrification, where sailing displacements and infrastructures permit; and vessel performance optimization. One of these challenges is addressed in this work: operational improvement in detection of the impact of fouling or opposite hull cleaning which enables greater efficiency and an increase in performance. In this paper, battery hybrid electric ship automation data are analysed using Curve Fitting and Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA) in order to interpret the impact of fouling on ship energy performance degradation by continuous monitoring. Although this methodology is already used for analysing various time series data, DFA is a novel approach that is first time that applied to a marine based data where fouling contains marine biological properties. Application of these techniques reveal that in only 9 months fouling, performance degradation of case study ferry faced 6% of average speed loss.","Ship energy efficiency,curve fitting,detrended fluctuation analysis,fouling,"

The karst aquifer of Gorski Kotar is a potentially important source of drinking water for two neighboring countries, Croatia and Slovenia (Central and South Europe), and is strongly influenced by both Mediterranean and continental weather conditions. It is a part of the Dinaric karst, which is “locus typicus” for karst worldwide and one of the most typical karst areas in the world. To answer the main question of our research, baseline data were thoroughly collected comprising stable isotopes, concentration of dissolved and total trace metals in water, and multi-elemental analyses of river sediments, together with other physical-chemical parameters (pH, dissolved oxygen, electric conductivity and temperature). Total dissolved solid (TDS) was not measured but estimated as (EC) 0.67. Such multi-technique approach was applied for the first time in the Dinaric karst systems. Multi-elemental analysis of fine sediment fraction (<63μm) of eight samples was performed by ICP-MS. Elemental composition of sediments is quite different in the two studied river valleys, which indicates different origin of their waters. Also, concentrations of selected metals were compared with existing sediment quality criteria and anthropogenic influence is evaluated and discussed. Analytical results of major ions determined in three springs (Kupa spring, Rječina spring, Zvir spring in the City of Rijeka) were used to construct a Piper diagram, which showed that they are of a Ca–Na–HCO3–Cl type. The highest concentration of Mg is present in the Kupa spring, while the highest concentrations of Na and Cl are present in the Zvir spring. Groundwaters are underlain by limestone, less by dolomite and are under a maritime influence. There is a big difference with the main groundwater types reported in North Africa, i.e. in the south Mediterranean Sea, where two main groundwater types are Na–Cl and Ca–SO4–Cl. Concentrations of total and dissolved fractions of trace metals in surface water samples were determined by voltammetry and compared to the European Water Framework Directive values. Concentrations of total Pb and Zn are significantly higher in the water of the Kupa spring than the Rječina spring, suggesting that the karst water bodies of the two springs are not of the same origin. In addition, stable isotope composition (deuterium and oxygen-18) was determined in the spring waters sampled during low and high water conditions. Due to the significant difference in oxygen isotope-ratios it was concluded that the karst reservoir for the Kupa and Rječina springs is not identical. The results obtained from the combination of physical–chemical, geochemical (water and sediment) and isotope multi-technique analyses pointed out that even though the springs of the Kupa and Rječina rivers originate from the same mountain range, they do not drain the same karst aquifer.","Risnjak National Park,Kupa and Rječina rivers (Croatia),Stable isotopes (deuterium and oxygen-18),Water quality,Transboundary karst aquifer,Perhumid climate,Sediment and water chemistry,Physical–chemical parameters,"
"modelling of pico satellite network applications to maritime interdiction operations","2011","The successful command and control of Maritime Interdiction Operations (MIO) depends heavily upon an organization's communications and network platforms. These platforms must provide effective, efficient, affordable communications among operational and tactical commanders, among globally distributed subject matter expert advisors, and especially, between these two groups. Since 2009, the researchers at the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) together with their Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) and overseas partners started to explore the benefits of using very small, Picosatellite based, private orbital tactical networking nodes to support expert reachback and coordination in Maritime Interdiction Operations scenarios. Currently the NPS team is assembling the first set of three Picosatellites to be launched during the second half of 2011 for conducting first field trials of MIO reachback via the orbital tactical node. In order to plan and design Picosatellite nodes integration experiments, we've developed the software model of future miniature orbital tactical nodes, which are currently under assembly, using the simulation modeling environment of the Satellite Tool Kit (STK). The paper describes the results of Picosatellite networking nodes simulation as well as analysis of their implementation in MIO scenarios.","Satellites,private orbital tactical networking nodes,Educational institutions,maritime interdiction operations,Materials,artificial satellites,command and control,satellite communication,Atmospheric modeling,Space vehicles,command and control systems,pico satellite network applications,military communication,simulation modeling environment,Satellite Tool Kit,Real time systems,Orbits,"
"maritime circular sar processing issues: antenna pattern verification, sea-clutter analysis & ship image autofocus","2018","During two SAR acquisition campaigns in 2015 and 2017, several circular SAR acquisitions have been performed on sea surface and ships. The 2015 set is full polarimetric acquisition at both X & L band (8 channels with 300 & 150 MHz bandwidth each). The 2017 set is vertical polarisation at X band (two channels with 2 GHz bandwidth each). Several processing issues had to be addressed with these experiments: - Simultaneous antenna pattern & sea clutter backscatter table evaluation was required because of antenna pattern compensation abnomalies at X band. - The autofocus used above ground was useless on the moving sea surface, hence the ships images required autofocus with tiepoints on the ship itself to compensate her own motion. During the 2017 campaign, low resolution images were synthesised on board to assess correct target acquisition during flight.",""
"study of inland river maritime radar image gabor wavelet edge recognition based on direction adaptive","2015","To realize automatic extracting edge of bank and bridge from inland marine time radar image, the first step is to get the detection region and realize superposition with the electronic chart display system automatically. Image processing of the radar image should be done firstly, to get radar coastline and the edge of the bridge and location information. The basic way of image processing in the target extraction based on two extraction methods, morphology and color characteristic. Color feature is mainly suitable for color image target. Especially for clear goals, according to color component achieve target extraction. Morphological features for feature extraction.

"anomalously severe cold nights and warm days in northeastern spain: their spatial variability, driving forces and future projections","2013","Spatial and temporal variability of the most extreme temperatures during extended winter (November–February, NDJF) and summer (May–August, MJJA) have been analyzed over northeast Spain. This work employed a high-quality daily temperature dataset of 128 station records spanning the period from 1959 to 2006. The uppermost (99th) percentile of daily maximum temperature distribution was used to define very warm days (hereafter VWD), while the lowermost (1st) percentile of daily minimum temperature distribution was adopted to identify very cold nights (hereafter VCN). The climatological conditions related to the initialization and persistence of these rare events were also examined. Based on daily Sea Level Pressure (SLP) and 200hPa and 500hPa geopotential height fields from the NCEP/NCAR re-analyses, major large-scale circulation patterns corresponding to these events over large domain of the North Atlantic and European regions were used in order to explore their interrelations with anomalous temperature in the study domain. Our results demonstrate that the occurrence of VCN was mainly associated to the dominance of cyclonic (anticyclonic) conditions over southern Europe and the Mediterranean (Scandinavia). This situation corresponded to an increase in the meridional circulation over much area of Western Europe, with strong advection of colder air from northern continental Europe and the north Atlantic to the study domain. For VWD, the most likely factors contributing to the frequency of these events were the north-eastward displacement of the Atlantic subtropical high and the increase in the European blockings. Based on data derived from a suite of regional climate models (RCMs) with the best validation results, future projections of the frequency and intensity of VWD and VCN events were also assessed under the A1B greenhouse gas emission scenario. Our results demonstrate that future VWD extremes could become more frequent and severe during the latter decades of the 21st century, while a number of simulations projected a general tendency for fewer VCN extremes. Over the study domain climate models predict even faster warming rates for the continental areas relative to coastal portions, which clearly comes in contrast with the observed climatology.","daily temperature,northeast Spain,atmospheric circulation,extremes,regional climate models,geopotential fields,"
"long-term observation of global nuclear power plants thermal plumes using landsat images and deep learning","2023","Thermal discharge from nuclear power plants poses a threat to the received natural water bodies, but the long-term extent and intensity of their surface thermal plumes remain unclear. In this study, we proposed a method to determine the background area for each drainage outlet and delineate the mixed surface thermal plumes based on 7,172 Landsat thermal infrared images. We further used a deep convolutional neural network integrated with prior location knowledge to extract core surface thermal plumes for 74 drainage outlets of 66 nuclear power plants worldwide. Our final model achieved a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 0.8998 and an F1 score of 0.8886. We found that the mean maximal water surface temperature (WST) increment of the studied plants globally was 4.80 K. The Tianwan plant in China experienced the highest WST increase (8.51 K), followed by the Gravelines plant in France and the Ohi plant in Japan (7.91 K and 7.71 K, respectively). The Bruce plant in Canada had the largest thermal-polluted surface area (7.22 km2). We also provided the dataset, Global Coastal Nuclear power plant Thermal Plume (GCNT-Plume), to describe the long-term occurrence of water surface thermal plumes. Three influencing factors of the water surface thermal plume were further analyzed in this study, including total capacity, drainage type, and location type, which were associated with operating power, drainage method, and geographical features, respectively. Total capacity was more statistically related to the maximum of WST increment under shallow drainage condition. The mean WST increment of shallow drainage was 1.22 K higher than that of deep drainage. Surface plumes larger than 4 km2 frequently occurred in the Great Lakes, while small surface thermal plumes (< 1 km2) were primarily found in estuaries. The proposed method provides an important framework for future operational water surface thermal plume detection using remotely sensed observations and deep learning.","Landsat,WST,Surface thermal plume,Deep learning,Thermal infrared remote sensing,Nuclear power plants,"

"improbability mapping: a metric for satellite-detection of submarine volcanic eruptions","2014","Submarine volcanic eruptions can result in both real and apparent changes in marine algal communities, e.g., increases in phytoplankton biomass and/or growth rates that can cover thousands of square kilometers. Satellite ocean color monitoring detects these changes as increases in chlorophyll and particulate backscattering. Detailed, high resolution analysis is needed to separate the optical effects of volcanic products from the response of the marine algal community. It is possible to calculate an index, which maps the magnitude of improbable change (relative to long term average conditions) following known volcanic eruptions by using low resolution, initial estimates of chlorophyll and backscatter along with an archived history of satellite data. We apply multivariate probability analysis to changes in global satellite ocean chlorophyll and particulate backscatter data to create a new metric for observing apparent biological responses to submarine eruptions. Several examples are shown, illustrating the sensitivity of our improbability mapping index to known submarine volcanic events, yielding a potentially robust method for the detection of new events in remote locations.","Improbability mapping index,Satellite detection,Submarine volcanic eruptions,"
"calcareous assemblages of the southeastern mediterranean low-tide estuaries — seasonal dynamics and paleo-environmental implications","2016","The study of estuarine ecosystems is essential for protecting and reestablishing their threatened biota. In this research the spatio-temporal variations in the distribution patterns of foraminifera, ostracods and molluscs are analyzed in surficial sediments sampled in 2012/13 at six low-tide estuaries of the southeastern Mediterranean coast. Live assemblages are studied using multivariate statistical analyses to determine their ecological preferences and seasonal dynamics whereas the dead assemblages are used to establish a reference baseline for future paleoenvironmental reconstruction. The statistical analysis indicates that salinity, TOC and % carbonate are the main environmental factors explaining 60% of the cumulative variance and controlling the distribution pattern of the different brackish taxa encountered in these estuaries. The foraminifera Ammonia tepida and some miliolids (Quinqueloculina and Varidentella) inhabit most estuaries during summer when salinities of 13–18psu and temperatures of 26–34°C occur. At the Naaman stream the agglutinated species Birsteiniolla macrostoma and Trichohyalus aguayoi dominate the assemblage during autumn and winter, respectively when salinities of 3–7psu and temperature of 18–24°C prevail. High abundance of the monospecific assemblage of the ostracod Cyprideis torosa was encountered at the Tanninim year round in oligohaline water. The gastropod Heleobia phaeniciaca prefers living at the Naaman and Tanninim streams while Pyrgophorus sp., an invasive and low salinity species, continue colonizing more stream reaches along the Israeli coast. The dead assemblages are composed of high numbers of local and transported species. It includes post storm-surge sediments containing high numbers of inland fresh and brackish water species transported by the floods. Those are mixed with inner to mid-shelf benthic and planktonic foraminifera, ostracods and molluscs. Transportation of the marine organisms a few hundred of meters inland via the estuaries indicates that the coastal areas are prone to storm surge events that are preserved clearly on the coast. The present study demonstrates that the combined use of different multi-proxy faunal records enhances significantly the understanding of the dynamics of low-tide estuaries. This can be applied also to other low-tide estuaries worldwide and facilitate better management of these threatened environments. Additionally, it enables understanding of the post-mortem processes that control the transition from the living to the death assemblages and by that improve paleoenvironmental reconstruction of the lower reaches of low-tide estuaries.","Ostracods,Molluscs,Southeastern Mediterranean,Live and dead assemblages,Low-tide estuaries,Foraminifera,"
"a task allocation scheme generation method for maritime oil spill emergency monitoring based on bilateral matching","2022","Aiming at the task allocation problem of maritime oil spill emergency monitoring, the bilateral matching theory is applied to standardize the task allocation process and improve the emergency effectiveness. First of all, the task of maritime oil spill emergency monitoring and the monitoring subjects carrying out the tasks are identified, and the specific types, difficulties and risks of the tasks are identified. Then, the task type is introduced to indirectly express the relationship between â€˜monitoring subject-taskâ€™. On this basis, two concepts of task demand satisfaction and emergency monitoring subject capability competency are proposed to express the preference information of bilateral subjects. And then on the basis of redefining the specific connotation of the basic concept of bilateral matching theory under the background of maritime oil spill emergency monitoring task allocation, a bilateral matching model for task allocation of maritime oil spill emergency monitoring considering attribute priority is constructed. Finally, according to the specific characteristics of the model, a fast generation algorithm of feasible solution is designed to solve the problem.

"prediction of ship domain on coastal waters by using ais data","2023","Ship domain is crucial for collision risk assessments and may vary depending on the navigation area. In this study, an empirical ship domain model for coastal waters is proposed. The proposed ship domain model is planned to reveal the ship domain model for an area where no traffic separation scheme exists. In the study, dodecagon ship domain for different type and size of vessels was created. One-year (11 month) of vessel encounters were analyzed and ship domain boundaries are prepared by considering different safety criteria. The passages of the vessel from forward, aft, port, and starboard were also statistically analyzed and the changes in ship domain dimensions according to the ship type and size are revealed. This model shows the vessels behavior regardless of traffic separation rules.","AIS Data,Marine traffic,Ship domain,"
"detecting co2 leakage at offshore storage sites using the covariance between the partial pressure of co2 and the saturation of dissolved oxygen in seawater","2018","An option to detect CO2 leakage from deep geological storage under the seabed is monitoring the partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) in the sea. One of the challenges of this technique is to differentiate pCO2 elevations caused by CO2 leakage from variations in the natural baseline (which varies due to seasonal and other factors). This paper compares a covariance threshold for anomalous pCO2 (a threshold based on pCO2 and dissolved oxygen), with annual and seasonal constant thresholds, using data observed in two hydrologically contrasting areas in Osaka Bay, Japan. In one of these locations the water column is typically stratified throughout the year, whereas at the other it is vertically mixed. The covariance threshold often but not consistently outperforms the constant thresholds, but is effective in all the cases analyzed in the present study. In any season in the mixed area, and in winter in the stratified area, the possibility of false-negatives in the seasonal threshold method is smaller than or comparable with that in the covariance threshold one. In areas with large natural pCO2 variations, such as during summer in the stratified area, the covariance threshold method is efficient in detecting CO2 leakage whereas the seasonal threshold method is of little use. With a good understanding of local conditions, monitoring pCO2 with the covariance threshold method is a potentially useful but not sufficient option for leakage detection in the marine environment.","Dissolved oxygen,CO leakage,Coastal ocean,Monitoring,Detection,Partial pressure of CO,"
"evidence for solar influence in a holocene speleothem record (père noël cave, se belgium)","2018","We present a decadal-centennial scale Holocene climate record based on trace elements contents from a 65 cm stalagmite from Belgian Père Noël cave. “Père Noël” (PN) stalagmite covers the last 12.7 ka according to U/Th dating. High spatial resolution measurements of trace elements (Sr, Ba and Mg) were done by Laser-Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS). Trace elements profiles were interpreted as environmental and climate changes in the Han-sur-Lesse region. Power spectrum estimators and continuous wavelet transform were applied on trace elements time series to detect any statistically significant periodicities in the PN stalagmite. Spectral analyses reveal decadal to millennial periodicities (i.e., 68–75, 133–136, 198–209, 291–358, 404–602, 912–1029 and 2365–2670 yr) in the speleothem record. Results were compared to reconstructed sunspot number data to determine whether solar signal is presents in PN speleothem. The occurrence of significant solar periodicities (i.e., cycles of Gleissberg, de Vries, unnamed 500 years, Eddy and Hallstatt) supports for an impact of solar forcing on PN speleothem trace element contents. Moreover, several intervals of significant rapid winter change were detected during the Holocene at 10.3, 9.3–9.5, around 8.2, 6.4–6.2, 4.7–4.5, and around 2.7 ka BP. Those intervals are similar to the cold winter events evidenced in different natural paleoclimate archives, suggesting common climate forcing mechanisms related to changes in solar irradiance.","Wavelet analysis,Solar forcing,Paleoclimate time-series,NAO,Speleothems,Cold winter events,Holocene,Trace elements,"
"steroid hormone profiles and body conditions of migrating male humpback whales (megaptera novaeangliae)","2021","Simultaneous analysis of multiple steroid hormones from remotely obtained blubber biopsies has the potential to concurrently provide information regarding stress and reproductive status from free-swimming cetaceans, while also investigating correlations between hormone concentrations and other health biomarkers. In this study we measured blubber concentration profiles of eight reproductive and adrenal steroid hormones (17α-hydroxy-progesterone, testosterone, androstenedione, progesterone, cortisol, 11-deoxy-corticosterone, oestrone, and oestradiol) together with body condition, as determined by the inverse Adipocyte Index, of 101 male humpback whales. Whales were sampled randomly at two time points, while migrating to and from their northeast Australian breeding grounds, allowing for intra- and inter-seasonal profile analysis. Testosterone, progesterone and cortisol together with androstenedione 17α-hydroxyprogesterone, and oestrone concentrations (the latter quantified for the first time in live biopsied male humpback whales) decreased between the northward and southward migrations. Decreasing testosterone levels during the height of humpback whale conceptions suggests asynchronicity between blubber testosterone levels and the expected peak of male fertility. Statistically significant relationships between levels of certain steroid analytes were observed and appeared to change between the early and late breeding seasons. During the northward migration, testosterone, progesterone, androstenedione, oestrone and 17α-hydroxyprogesterone levels were positively correlated. Cortisol concentrations correlated positively with those of testosterone during the northward migration, but negatively during the southward migration. Androstenedione and testosterone were positively correlated with adiposity during the late breeding season. These hormone-hormone and hormone-adiposity correlations may be reflective of the activation of certain steroid hormone synthesis pathways, or alternatively, of concomitant physiological stimuli. As steroid hormones work in concert, information on multiple steroid hormones is needed to interpret endocrinological status and understand the relationships between these compounds and ancillary health markers. This study provides steroid hormone profiles of wild male humpback whales, as well as the first insight into seasonal male endocrinology as a function of adiposity.","Cortisol,Breeding season,Reproduction,Testosterone,Adipocytes,Stress biomarker,"

The study is based on a set of methods used both for the interpolation and the cartographic representation of the results as well as on statistical methods for the detection of breaks in the time series. It is possible through them to underscore a climatic variability at the regional level at the end of the 1960s and at the beginning of the 1970s, with, however, an important variability in space of the intensity of the phenomenon. The conclusions drawn previously from the study conducted on Côte d'Ivoire do not constitute a unique case.

"a ten-year analysis of cloud-to-ground lightning activity over the eastern mediterranean region","2015","Lightning activity is analysed in a sector covering the Eastern Mediterranean (16–32°E, 34–46°N) for the years 2005–2014. The study is based on the use of cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning activity data retrieved from ZEUS system, operated by the National Observatory of Athens, and examines the seasonal, diurnal and spatial variability of the lightning activity. The effect of elevation, terrain slope, vegetation cover and convective available potential energy (CAPE) on the distribution of the CG lightning strokes is also investigated. Lightning is modulated by the diurnal cycle of insolation and the underlying topographic features of the region. The lightning strokes are more numerous over the mainland than over the sea. CG lightning activity is dominant over the land and the coastal areas during spring and summer while during the coldest period of the year it is dominant over the sea. The maximum value of lightning activity is observed in June and mostly in the afternoon. The orography and the terrain slope affect the distribution of lightning. During the warmest period of the year, the forested areas have an increased “lightning yield”. The number of CG lightning strokes increases with increasing CAPE and the high correlation between them indicates that CAPE values could be used as a proxy for the presence of lightning activity, at least over the eastern Mediterranean region.","Vegetation cover,Topographic features,Lightning climatology,Eastern Mediterranean,CAPE,"
"maritime automated targets recognition algorithm test bed for high resolution isar imagery","2013","A maritime automatic target recognition system is under development to perform ship classification using images from inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) systems. This work will describe the algorithm framework for feature extraction, classification, and aim-point recognition. ISAR systems produce two-dimensional images of ships from the periodic motion inherent to all maritime objects and can be used to distinguish objects of interest for Homeland Security. There is a need for real-time classification of these objects. This work extends the state of the art in two ways: One - current maritime classification focuses on satellite ISAR, creating latency for classification[1]; and Two - work with Homeland Security ISAR radar systems is focused on concealed weapon detection [2,3]. This work uses localized ISAR images from stationary radars to classify maritime objects. Since the aspect and cross-range scale factor are continually changing, ISAR images form distinct representations unique to each object under observation. These distinct representations are analogous to visual images in many ways. They have unique shapes and areas of strong return, much in the same way objects in passive images have unique sizes and colors. However, ISAR images are synthetic portrayals of scattered field data from active sensor RF sensors whereas visual images are observations of passive sensors. This distinction must be a considered as a design constraint in the classification system - each feature employed must be exhaustively examined regarding its physical counterpart.

"security in iot-enabled digital twins of maritime transportation systems","2023","The purposes are to explore the safety performance of the Maritime Transportation System (MTS) based on Digital Twins (DTs) Internet of Things (IoT) and develop maritime transportation towards intelligence and digitalization. Because the comprehensive operational security of modern MTS is not yet mature, historical transportation data of the Maritime Silk Road are acquired and preprocessed. Afterward, DTs are introduced, and relay nodes are added to data transmission paths to construct a maritime transportation DTs model based on relay cooperation IoT. Eventually, this modelâ€™s security performance is validated through simulation experiments. Relay security analysis suggests that interference information is a vital guarantee to assist in information non-disclosure, from which the constructed model can harvest energy to increase the data transmission power, thereby improving communication performance and secrecy rate. Outage probability analysis reveals that the simulated and the theoretical results are almost the same; moreover, given the systemâ€™s multi-hop paths in the same environment, the more the relays and the greater the fading index, the better the system performance and the lower the outage probability. Once the iterations reach a particular number, the node secrecy rate becomes optimal and cannot cause excessive burden to the system; besides, the power distribution can establish a new equilibrium when the nodes are in different locations, so that system security performance gets improved. The simulated value is closest to the actual result under 100% successful transmission probability and  $0.01\sim 0.05~\lambda $  value. To sum up, the constructed maritime transportation DTs model presents extraordinary transmission and security performance, providing an experimental basis for intelligent and secure maritime transportation in the future.","telecommunication network reliability,telecommunication security,telecommunication power management,Maritime Transportation System,Transportation,secure maritime transportation,historical transportation data,maritime transportation systems,Internet of Things,intelligent maritime transportation,Marine vehicles,maritime transportation DTs model,data transmission paths,relay nodes,IoT-enabled digital twins,Radio frequency,Maritime Silk Road,digital twins,comprehensive operational security,outage probability analysis,Relays,digitalization,relay cooperation IoT,node secrecy rate,communication performance,wireless channels,safety performance,relay security analysis,system performance,system security performance,cooperative communication,probability,Digital Twins Internet,data transmission power,Sensors,relay cooperation,Digital twins,Security,maritime transportation system,maritime silk road,"

"analysis of terrain attributes in different spatial resolutions for digital soil mapping application in southeastern brazil","2020","Terrain attributes are used as auxiliary variables in spatial prediction of soil classes and properties, due to their important role in the pedogenetic process and the increasing availability of digital elevation models (DEMs) in different resolutions. This work analyzed the effect of the different spatial resolutions of the DEMs and attributes derived from terrain and their implications for application in DSM predictive models. We used three spatial resolutions from different DEMs: (1) LIDAR – 2 m; (2) ALOS PALSAR – 12.5 and 30 m; (3) SRTM – 30 m; and (4) ASTER GDEM – 30 m. Multivariate analyses were performed determined by the Pearson linear correlation coefficient (r), the K-means cluster analysis, and the principal component analysis (PCA). The prediction of soil classes was performed using the terrain attributes grouped as to sensitivity to resolution, for different spatial resolutions, applying the machine learning algorithms Random Forest and Support Vector Machine. The cluster analysis indicated that most attributes remained within the same group of resolution sensitivity with changes in the cell size of reference DEM. The attributes of the terrain grouped low sensitive to resolution derived from the SRTM DEM showed better precision and the main advantage was the low cost and facilitating computational processing for application in the DSM.","Machine learning,Multivariate analysis,Digital elevation model,Morphometry,"
"influence of aerosol particles from biomass burning on cloud microphysical properties and radiative forcing","2006","Aerosol from biomass burning has been shown to strongly modify cloud microphysical properties and cloud lifetime through the so-called “indirect effect.” However, in the case of a lack of wet scavenging, it stays suspended for days to weeks and can be transported to considerable distances within an elevated layer above low-level cloud tops with minimal aerosol–cloud interactions. The observations carried out during the Southern African Regional Science Initiative (SAFARI) 2000 dry season field campaign often revealed the presence of an elevated biomass-burning aerosol layer above a semi-permanent stratiform cloud deck off the southern African coasts. MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) cloud products were used to investigate the existence of an aerosol indirect effect on convective clouds. Results are presented documenting cloud effective radius and cloud radiative forcing variations due to the presence of the aerosol during the development of convective clouds. Radiative transfer simulations in the visible (0.8μm, VIS) and near-infrared (1.6, 2.1 and 3.7μm, NIR) wavelengths were instrumental in establishing the extent of the influence of a biomass-burning aerosol layer overlying a water cloud sheet on the MODIS satellite retrieval of cloud parameters, in particular the effective radius and the optical thickness. The radiative transfer simulations suggest that the presence of the aerosol induces a significant underestimation of the cloud optical thickness, whereas an underestimation of the retrieved effective radius is more pronounced in the retrieval that makes use of the 1.6μm waveband than the 2.1 and 3.7μm wavebands. The MODIS cloud products of 3 days of the SAFARI 2000 campaign were analyzed to determine whether the aerosol induced biases evidenced by the simulations also affect the operational cloud property retrieval. Cloud parameters, in particular the effective radius, are usually employed as indicators of the occurrence of aerosol–cloud interaction according to the “indirect effect.” However, these results highlight some of the difficulties associated with satellite retrievals of cloud properties and show the importance of an accurate sighting of the cloud and aerosol layer top and bottom heights in order to prevent erroneous detections of indirect effects.","Aerosol–cloud interactions,Remote sensing,Cloud parameter retrieval,Radiative transfer,"
"using satellite image analysis for locating prehistoric archaeological sites in alaska's central brooks range","2015","In this pilot study, we apply satellite image analysis to archaeological site prospection in Alaska's Brooks Range. Our goal was to test whether satellite remote sensing, which has been successful in locating large archaeological features associated with sedentary peoples, could be applied to arctic interior sites associated with mobile hunter–gatherers. In particular, we strove to develop a relatively straightforward and inexpensive model using existing data which could be used to help guide archaeology surveys. Using 1-m resolution IKONOS imagery of Lake Matcharak along the upper Noatak River, we produced a Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and tasseled cap transformation of the study area and stacked these five vegetation indices into one image. We then applied unsupervised and supervised classifications to the image first, to test for the presence of a site-specific spectral class and second, determine the nature of that class. Through a visual analysis of the unsupervised classification, a spectral phenomenon was seen to co-occur with archaeological sites in the study area. The supervised classification provided a high-resolution land cover map used to identify the signature as the ecotone between un-vegetated sediments and dense willow (Salix sp.) stands. Dense willow stands along the Lake Matcharak shore visually correlate with most of the known archaeological sites, possibly reflecting landform and/or vegetation characteristics that would have appealed to past inhabitants. The methods described here could contribute to building better survey strategies and archaeological predictive models for elsewhere in the Brooks Range and Alaska.","Site prospection,Archaeology,Multi-spectral analysis,Satellite imagery,Hunter–gatherers,Prehistoric sites,Alaska,Site reconnaissance,Arctic,"
"reliability evaluation of the hybrid-redundancy sensor fault tolerate system in the dredging perception system","2023","The accurate evaluation of equipment reliability is critical in engineering applications and especially challenging for equipment with complex structures and high reliability requirements. In this paper, a reliability evaluation method based on semi-Markov process is proposed and applied to the hybrid-redundancy sensor fault tolerant (HRSFT) system within the perception system of a cutter suction dredger (CSD). The method takes into account the harsh operating environment of the CSD sensor, and considers the temporal occurrence of sensor faults as well as the imperfection of the sensor fault diagnosis and isolation (SFDI). The outcomes of the model applied to a case study indicate that three key factors, namely, the failure rate of the sensors, the false alarm rate (FAR) of the SFDI system and the self-correction rate (SCR) of the HRSFT system, have a significant impact on the system reliability. Additionally, we performed a comparative analysis between the HRSFT and Double Redundancy Sensor Fault Tolerant (DRSFT) systems, from which the superiority of the HRSFT system in terms of reliability is demonstrated. A series of experiments were conducted with varying parameters values, to show the high adaptability of the model to the HRSFT system.","Fault-tolerant system,Cutter suction dredger,Semi-markov process,Redundancy sensors,Reliability modeling,"
"real-time vision based obstacle detection in maritime environments","2022","Automatic obstacle detection is a key feature for unmanned surface vehicles (USV) operating in a fully autonomous manner. While there are currently many approaches to obstacle detection in maritime environments (e.g., LiDAR, radar) the proposed approach resorts to standard, inexpensive RGB cameras to perform the detection of such obstacles. Recent advances in deep neural network detectors achieve state-of-the-art detection results, and some one-stage networks achieve very good results while maintaining inference times small enough to be compatible with real-time capabilities on low-cost embedded processing units.In this paper, we train the YOLO v4 network to detect different types of ships, using publicly available maritime datasets. After training, we evaluate the obtained network on the processing unit located onboard the UAV with respect to detection accuracy and real-time processing capability, thus demonstrating that the presented detection method can be considered a robust, fast, flexible, and inexpensive approach to obstacle detection in USV applications.","real-time vision,deep learning (artificial intelligence),robot vision,control engineering computing,Feature extraction,Neural networks,Laser radar,image colour analysis,YOLO v4 network,Embedded Systems,cameras,object detection,maritime environments,deep neural network detectors,Real-time systems,Unmanned Surface Vehicles,Object Detection,Training,unmanned surface vehicles,mobile robots,automatic obstacle detection,collision avoidance,Deep Learning,publicly available maritime datasets,Detectors,Convolutional Neural Networks,Radar detection,"
"weighted block ℓ1 norm induced 2d off-grid compressive beamforming for acoustic source localization: methodology and applications","2023","Identifying acoustic sources with high spatial resolution and precision is significant for machinery noise control. Off-grid compressive beamforming is an effective method for creating acoustic maps with a high spatial resolution. In this study, a two-dimensional off-grid compressive beamforming method via weighted block ℓ1 norm regularization (WBS-OCSBF) is proposed. The weighted ℓ1 norm offers a more uniform sparsity penalty compared to the ℓ1 norm. This method can enhance the performance of off-grid compressive beamforming. Additionally, it is easily implemented on mature linear programming solvers and converges with only a few iterations. Numerical simulations are conducted to analyze the effects of several major parameters on the performance of the proposed method. The simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over some traditional methods. The proposed method is then validated using a loudspeaker noises localization experiment. A gearbox transmission system and a transformer are used as two specific objects to explore the industrial application value. The proposed method can effectively localize the gear meshing noise and transformer discharge faults with a high spatial resolution.","Acoustic source localization,Weighted block  norm,2D off-grid model,Acoustic imaging,Compressive beamforming,"
"geospatial data analysis for global maritime risk assessment using the discrete global grid system","2021","The effective management of the safety of navigation by coastguards is challenged by the complexity in quantifying and describing the relative risk of accidents occurrence. The discovery of patterns in observation data is reliant on the collection and analysis of significant volumes of relevant heterogenous spatial datasets. Conventional approaches of risk mapping which aggregate vessel traffic and incident data into Cartesian grids can result in misrepresentation due to inherent inadequacies in this spatial data format. In this paper, we explore how the Discrete Global Grid System (DGGS) overcomes these limitations through the development of global maps of incident rates at multiple resolutions. The results demonstrate hot spots of relative high risk across different regions and clearly show that DGGS is more suited to global analysis than conventional grids. This work contributes to a greater understanding of both the disposition of maritime risk and the advantages of adopting DGGS in supporting big data analysis.","Risk management,Discrete Global Grid System,Safety,Navigation,Geospatial analysis,Spatial databases,Big Data,Maritime Risk,Automatic Identification System,Graphical models,Planning,"

"integration of in-situ and multi-sensor satellite observations for long-term water quality monitoring in coastal areas","2020","Recently, there have been significant efforts in the integration of in-situ and satellite observations for effective monitoring of coastal areas (e.g., the Copernicus program of the European Space Agency). In this study, a 15-year diurnal variation of Water Constituent Concentrations (WCCs) was retrieved from multi-sensor satellite images and in-situ hyperspectral measurements using Radiative Transfer (RT) modeling in the Dutch Wadden Sea. The existing RT model 2SeaColor was inverted against time series of in-situ hyperspectral measurements of water leaving reflectances (Rrs [sr−1]) for the simultaneous retrieval of WCCs (i.e., Chlorophyll-a (Chla), Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM), Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM)) on a daily basis between 2003 and 2018 at the NIOZ jetty station (the NJS) located in the Dutch part of the Wadden Sea. At the same time, the existing coupled atmosphere-hydro-optical RT model MOD2SEA was used for the simultaneous retrieval of WCCs from time series of multi-sensor satellite images of the MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) onboard ENVISAT, Multispectral Instrument (MSI) onboard Sentinel-2 and Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) onboard Sentinel-3 between 2003 and 2018 over the Dutch Wadden Sea. At the NJS, a direct comparison (Taylor diagram and statistical analysis) showed strong agreement between in-situ and satellite-derived WCC values (Chla: R2 ≥ 0.70, RMSE ≤7.5 [mg m−3]; SPM: R2 ≥ 0.72, RMSE ≤5.5 [g m−3]; CDOM absorption at 440 nm: R2 ≥ 0.67, RMSE ≤1.7 [m−1]). Next, the plausibility of the spatial variation of retrieved WCCs over the study area was evaluated by generating maps of Chla [mg m−3], SPM [g m−3], and CDOM absorption at 440 nm [m−1] from MERIS and OLCI images using the MOD2SEA model.

"atmospheric circulation patterns in the arab region and its relationships with saudi arabian surface climate: a preliminary assessment","2015","This paper establishes and analyses the principal circulation patterns in and around Saudi Arabia (domain: 10°E–70°E; 5°N–40°N) based on the daily mean sea-level pressure (MSLP) 0.75°×0.75° gridded data derived from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) re-analysis ERA-Interim for the period 1979–2012. Association of the circulation patterns to the local climate is investigated using observed daily temperature and rainfall data at 27 locations over Saudi Arabia for the period 1979–2010. Using the widely-used mathematical technique principal component analysis (PCA) we determine with MSLP data the principal patterns. We only analyse data for the wet season (October–May). The automated typing procedure establishes 12 circulation types, which represent all the main synoptic features especially those that originate from the Mediterranean, the European and African continents, Siberia, and also the Red and Arabian seas. There is a strong link between the circulation types and surface climate that is synoptically and spatially interpretable. Particular circulation types are associated with specific climatic conditions across the country: rainfall is linked with Types 9, 10 and 11, whilst warm days (nights) with 1, 2, 3, 9, 10, 11 and 12 (1, 2, 3, 10, 11 and 12), and cold days (nights) with 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 11 and 12 (2, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8).

"maritime surveillance using multiple high-frequency surface-wave radars","2014","In the last decades, great interest has been directed toward low-power high-frequency (HF) surface-wave radars as long-range early warning tools in maritime-situational-awareness applications. These sensors, developed for ocean remote sensing, provide an additional source of information for ship detection and tracking, by virtue of their over-the-horizon coverage capability and continuous-time mode of operation. Unfortunately, they exhibit many shortcomings that need to be taken into account, such as poor range and azimuth resolution, high nonlinearity, and significant presence of clutter. In this paper, radar detection, multitarget tracking, and data fusion (DF) techniques are applied to experimental data collected during an HF-radar experiment, which took place between May and December 2009 on the Ligurian coast of the Mediterranean Sea. The system performance is defined in terms of time on target (ToT), false alarm rate (FAR), track fragmentation, and accuracy. A full statistical characterization is provided using one month of data. The effectiveness of the tracking and DF procedures is shown in comparison to the radar detection algorithm. In particular, the detector's FAR is reduced by one order of magnitude. Improvements, using the DF of the two radars, are also reported in terms of ToT as well as accuracy.","ship tracking,sensor fusion,marine radar,statistical characterization,ship detection,radar detection,target detection,early warning tool,ToT,false alarm rate,data fusion,sea clutter,Data fusion (DF),maritime situational awareness applications,multitarget tracking,ocean remote sensing,target tracking,statistical analysis,ships,maritime surveillance,Target tracking,high-frequency (HF) surface wave (HFSW) radar,DF techniques,search radar,Radar tracking,time on target,over-the-horizon coverage capability,HF radar,Logic gates,sensor,radar tracking,information source,Clutter,track fragmentation,Surveillance,high-frequency surface wave radar,remote sensing by radar,continuous time operation mode,oceanographic techniques,"
"analysis of modis–misr calibration differences using surface albedo around aeronet sites and cloud reflectance","2007","MODIS and MISR are two Earth Observing System instruments flown onboard the Terra satellite. Their synergistic use could greatly benefit the broad user community by ensuring a global view of the Earth with high-quality products. A necessary condition for data fusion is radiometric calibration agreement between the two instruments. Earlier studies showed about 3% absolute radiometric difference between MISR and respective MODIS land bands in the visible and near-IR spectrum, which are also used in aerosol and cloud research. This study compared two surface albedo products derived from MODIS and MISR L1B data using the AERONET-based Surface Reflectance Validation Network (ASRVN). The ASRVN shows a positive MISR–MODIS albedo bias of +(0.01–0.03). Cross-sensor calibration inconsistencies were identified as a primary cause of the albedo biases. To establish an independent MODIS–MISR calibration link, top-of-atmosphere MODIS and MISR reflectances were regressed against each other over liquid water clouds. The empirical regression results have been adjusted for the differences in the respective MISR and MODIS spectral responses using radiative transfer simulations. The MISR–MODIS band gain differences for the top-of-atmosphere reflectance estimated with this technique are +6.0% in the Blue, +3.3% in the Green, +2.7% in the Red, and +0.8% in the NIR band. Applying the derived values to rescale the MODIS or MISR L1B data is shown to significantly reduce the cross-sensor ASRVN surface albedo biases. An absolute calibration scale for both sensors could be established based on independent ground-based measurements of the surface albedo at selected AERONET sites.","Calibration,AERONET,Cloud regression,MODIS,Surface albedo,MISR,"
"discovering themes and trends in transportation research using topic modeling","2017","Transportation research is a key area in both science and engineering. In this paper, we present an empirical analysis of 17,163 articles published in 22 leading transportation journals from 1990 to 2015. We apply a latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model on article abstracts to infer 50 key topics. We show that those characterized topics are both representative and meaningful, mostly corresponding to established sub-fields in transportation research. These identified fields reveal a research landscape for transportation. Based on the results of LDA, we quantify the similarity of journals and countries/regions in terms of their aggregated topic distributions. By measuring the variation of topic distributions over time, we find some general research trends, such as topics on sustainability, travel behavior and non-motorized mobility are becoming increasingly popular over time. We also carry out this temporal analysis for each journal, observing a high degree of consistency for most journals. However, some interesting anomaly, such as special issues on particular topics, are detected from temporal variation as well. By quantifying the temporal trends at the country/region level, we find that countries/regions display clearly distinguishable patterns, suggesting that research communities in different regions tend to focus on different sub-fields. Our results could benefit different parties in the academic community—including researchers, journal editors and funding agencies—in terms of identifying promising research topics/projects, seeking for candidate journals for a submission, and realigning focus for journal development.","Research policy,Topic modeling,Transportation research,Publication data,"

"enabling maritime risk assessment using natural language processing-based deep learning techniques","2020","Maritime vessels around the world risk encountering dangerous situations during their voyages such as piracy, kidnappings, hijackings, and smugglings. Such dangers may put crews at risk and potentially cause extensive damage to both the vessel and its cargo. Maritime risk assessment is a process of analyzing such factors to positively impact the safety and timeliness of operations. Analyzing the high-risk areas in seas and oceans can help vessels route around areas with previously recorded high levels of dangerous activities. This information is scraped and extracted from various maritime documents, including newspaper articles, social media, incident blogs, and operational reports. After textual data sources are parsed, it is possible to use this extracted information as training datasets into a Machine Learning (ML) model using Natural Language Processing (NLP) Deep Learning (DL) techniques. With these methods, we can perform document classification, risk extraction, text summarization, topic modeling, and information extraction in an automated manner. Methods that are used include the bag-of words (BOW) approach and, in particular, the use of Named Entity Recognition (NER) to identify specific areas around the world that are considered a risk to a particular voyage. Once this information is processed, the model can determine and aggregate specific areas of high-risk activity. We propose a Maritime Event Log (MEL) pipeline using DL methods. This pipeline includes binary document classification (DC) to extract positive instances of incidents, an incident type classification (IC,) and an information extraction module (IE) including date and location and ship type extraction. With such information available, it is possible to avoid dangerous situations, which may have a significant level of impact on the safety and success rate of maritime operations.","Bit error rate,Pipelines,newspaper articles,Text categorization,Hidden Markov models,deep learning (artificial intelligence),Information retrieval,machine learning model,maritime vessels,information retrieval,natural language processing,maritime risk assessment,safety,bag-of words approach,high-risk activity,information extraction module,ships,marine safety,marine engineering,maritime event log pipeline,vessels route,operational reports,ship type extraction,named entity recognition,risk management,pattern classification,incident type classification,Classification algorithms,maritime documents,text summarization,incident blogs,Training,risk extraction,textual data sources,text analysis,deep learning techniques,social media,maritime operations,binary document classification,topic modeling,"

"relating anomalous large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns to temperature and precipitation anomalies in the east asian monsoon region","2020","The anomalous large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns concerned with surface air temperature and precipitation anomalies within East Asian Monsoon region for winter and summer months from 1979 to 2017 are analyzed by employing the self-organizing map (SOM) neural network. The asymmetric 3 × 4 SOM neural network is firstly constructed with the geopotential height anomalies at 500-hPa level as the only input variable. Then 12 characteristic anomalous large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns (nodes) are identified. The composites of temperature and precipitation anomalies as well as vertical wind anomalies at 500-hPa level assigned to each node are generated and visualized. The spatial distributions of anomalous geopotential height (anticyclones or cyclones) are highly consistent with that of surface air temperature anomalies in both winter and summer. Most precipitation extremes in winter are attributed to the joint effect of the horizontal and vertical atmospheric motions, while strong air convection is prone to inducing extreme precipitation events in summer. Based on the SOM classification, the differences of atmospheric circulations, temperature and precipitation anomalies have also been partly identified in strong and weak phases of East Asia Monsoon.","Temperature and precipitation anomalies,Self-organizing map,East Asian Monsoon,Atmospheric circulation patterns,"
"maritime vessel traffic modeling in the context of concept drift","2017","Maritime traffic modeling serves the purpose of extracting human-readable information and discovering knowledge in the otherwise illegible mass of traffic data. The goal of this study is to examine the presence and character of fluctuations in maritime traffic patterns. The main objective is to identify such fluctuations and capture them in terms of a concept drift, i.e., unforeseen shifts in statistical properties of the modeled target occurring over time. The empirical study is based on a collection of AIS vessel tracking data, spanning over a year. The scope of the study limits the AIS data area to the Baltic region (9-31°E, 53-66°N), which experiences some of the most dense maritime traffic in the world. The investigations employ a novel maritime traffic modeling method based on the potential fields concept, adapted for this study to facilitate the examination of concept drift. The concept drift is made apparent in course of the statistical and visual analysis of the experimental results. This study shows a number of particular cases, in which the maritime traffic is affected by concept drifts of varying extent and character. The visual representations of the traffic models make shifts in the traffic patterns apparent and comprehensible to human eye. Based on the experimental outcomes, the robustness of the modeling method against concept drift in traffic is discussed and improvements are proposed. The outcomes provide insights into regularly reoccurring drifts and irregularities within the traffic data itself that may serve to further optimize the modeling method, and – in turn – the performance of detection based on it.","maritime traffic,concept drift,traffic modeling,anomaly detection,"
"analysis of variations and trends of temperature over niger central hydrological area, nigeria, 1911–2015","2023","Adequate information about the variations and trends of climatic variables is indispensable for the better management of the water resources and agricultural sectors. In this study, the variability and trends of the monthly, seasonal and annual temperatures ((TMIN, TMAX and TMEAN) time series were studied over Niger Central Hydrological Area, Nigeria (NCHA) during 1911–2015 using the Climate Research Unit (CRU) data. Different statistical operations analysis comprising descriptive statistics, linear regression model, Mann–Kendall test, Pettitt's test and standard normal homogeneity test (SNHT) were employed for the analysis. The tests were used to examine the temperature variability, presence of monotonic trends and change points of the time series. The monthly TMEAN variability over the entire area was between 2.10% and 3.61%. Periods 1914–1925 and 1974–1980 showed cooling trends, while 1930–1935, 1981–1988 and 2001–2015 exhibited warming trends. The annual TMIN and TMEAN showed positive trends across the 33 sub-basins of NCHA, while the TMAX showed mixed trends. The increasing trend was most significant on the monthly, seasonal and annual timescales of the TMIN, followed by TMEAN. In contrast, the mixed trends in TMAX were not significant. The global rate of change trends of TMIN, TMAX and TMEAN are 0.091, −0.007 and 0.043 °C/decade respectively. The overall warming of TMEAN also had a significant upward shift change of 0.43 °C since 1980 and the change spatially is characterized by a SW-NE orientation.

Quality-screened and cloud-cleared Version 3.01 Level 2 NASA Cloud Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) 5-km Aerosol Profile datasets are analyzed from 2007 to 2009. Numerical simulations from the U.S. Naval Aerosol Analysis and Predictive System (NAAPS), featuring two-dimensional variational assimilation of NASA Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer and Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer quality-assured datasets, combined with regional ground-based lidar measurements, are considered for assessing CALIOP retrieval performance, identifying bias, and evaluating regional representativeness. CALIOP retrievals of aerosol particle extinction coefficient and aerosol optical depth (AOD) are high over land and low over open waters relative to NAAPS (0.412/0.312 over land for all data points inclusive, 0.310/0.235 when the per bin average is used and each is treated as single data points; 0.102/0.151 and 0.086/0.124, respectively, over ocean). Regional means, however, are very similar (0.180/0.193 for all data points and 0.155/0.159 when averaged per normalized bin), as the two factors offset one another. The land/ocean offset is investigated, and discrepancies attributed to interpretation of particle composition and a-priori assignment of the extinction-to-backscatter ratio (“lidar ratio”) necessary for retrieving the extinction coefficient from CALIOP signals. Over land, NAAPS indicates more dust present than CALIOP algorithms are identifying, indicating a likely assignment of a higher lidar ratio representative of more absorptive particles. NAAPS resolves more smoke over water than identified with CALIOP, indicating likely usage of a lidar ratio characteristic of less absorptive particles to be applied that biases low AOD there. Over open waters except within the Bay of Bengal, aerosol particle scattering is largely capped below 1.5km MSL, though ground-based lidar measurements at Singapore differ slightly from this finding. Significant aerosol particle presence over land is similarly capped near 3.0km MSL over most regions. Particle presence at low levels regionally, except over India, is dominated by relatively non-depolarizing particles. Industrial haze, sea salt droplets and fresh smoke are thus most likely present.","Southeast Asia,Lidar,Aerosol particle scattering,CALIPSO,Aerosol composition,Maritime Continent,"
"data-driven methods for detection of abnormal ship behavior: progress and trends","2023","Maritime traffic safety influences the development of world economies. A major aspect to enhance maritime traffic safety is the effective detection of abnormal ship behavior (DASB) which recently have been widely made based on data-driven methods using multisource heterogeneous data. In order to provide an overview of the state-of-the-art of research, this study presents a review of DASB. First, the categories of abnormal ship behavior and data sources of DASB are concretely introduced, and the process of data-driven DASB combined with expert knowledge are described. Second, we conduct systematic disciplinary knowledge maps in the field of DASB, which identify evolution, hotspots and emerging trends. In this manner, data-driven methods for DASB were categorized into six types, including multisource data fusion approaches, statistical analysis approaches, traditional intelligent algorithmic approaches, deep learning approaches, knowledge-based and data-driven integrating approaches and computing power, and provide an overview of them. Then, we propose an integrated framework for DASB. Finally, we discuss the challenges in terms of three technical aspects (data, algorithm, and computing power) and outline possible paths of investigation for DASB to improve intelligent maritime surveillance.","Anomaly detection,Maritime traffic,Data-driven,Ship behavior,"
"assessment of arctic snow stratigraphy and water equivalent using a portable frequency modulated continuous wave radar","2023","There is significant spatial variability in snow cover characteristics across the Arctic. Current physical or empirical approaches to simulate or measure snow state variables suffer from poor spatial and/or temporal resolutions. Our current understanding of the spatio-temporal variability in Arctic snow cover leads to uncertainties in existing snow property retrievals from space or in models, thus leading to a poor representation of the snow cover in various climate models and reanalysis products. In this paper, we developed a method to derive total snow depth from a ground-based radar as well as distinguishing the two main layers generally observed in Arctic snowpacks: Depth Hoar and Wind Slab. This algorithm was developed for a 24 GHz Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave radar. The novelty of our approach resides in the fact that no validation snow pits are required if previous data on snow conditions (snow depth and density) are known. The impact of the underlying ecotypes on the radar-derived snow stratigraphy was also investigated. The RMSE of the snow depth ranges from 3.5 to 25 cm, but mostly varies between 10 and 15 cm (< 25%). The RMSE is based on snow pit data that has a corresponding radar measurement.","Snow depth retrieval,Radar,Snow pit,Ecotype,Arctic snow,FMCW,"
"maritime linked data for situational awareness heterogeneous sensor networks","2021","Maritime heterogeneous sensor networks (HSN), which are widely used in support of marine monitoring, maritime security and safety applications, combine diversified sensing systems and platforms observing the state of environmental features of interest or the status of anthropogenic objects to achieve awareness on the situation. To model the information characteristics of HSN observations for maritime situational awareness (MSA), we developed the MSA-HSN ontology, an integrated semantic model for maritime linked data, specifically observations suiting the requirements of maritime information fusion systems. MSA-HSN integrates established ontologies and models for sensors, observations, measurements, quantities, and occurrents, tailored to MSA applications and requirements. To support the interoperability with existing maritime data models, MSA-HSN is aligned with the relevant aspects of the EUCISE/e-CISE (Common Information Sharing Environment) data models. As a validation use case, in this paper the MSA-HSN ontology is applied to model the information elements of the maritime surveillance system developed within the Interactive Extreme-Scale Analytics and Forecasting (INFORE) project, where different situational views offered by a variegate suite of sensors and platforms are fused using big data analytics to achieve maritime situational awareness for maritime security. The paper describes the design of the MSA-HSN ontology, illustrating its application through examples taken from the INFORE use case and from relevant datasets developed by recent European projects involving MSA use cases.","Heterogeneous Sensor Network (HSN),Semantics,information characteristics,Linked data,Occurrents,Maritime Security,safety applications,maritime surveillance system,maritime data models,HSN observations,maritime security,Sea measurements,integrated semantic model,situational awareness heterogeneous sensor networks,MSA applications,common information sharing environment,Information Quality,maritime situational awareness,MSA-HSN ontology,maritime information fusion systems,data analysis,Maritime Surveillance,wireless sensor networks,Ontology,Oceans,Data models,different situational views,European projects,Maritime Situational Awareness (MSA),MSA use cases,maritime heterogeneous sensor networks,Knowledge Graph,ontologies (artificial intelligence),marine monitoring,big data analytics,Maritime Linked Data,Big Data,MSA Ontology,Java,Ontologies,maritime linked data,marine communication,video surveillance,Maritime Events,INFORE project,interactive extreme-scale analytics and forecasting,"
"simultaneous determination of four organotins in food packaging by high-performance liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry","2015","A simple method based on high-performance liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) was developed for the simultaneous determination of organotins—tri-n-butyltin chloride (TBT), triphenyltin chloride (TPT), dibutyltin dichloride (DBT), and diphenyltin dichloride (DPT)—in plastic food packaging. Samples were prepared by ultrasonic extraction with dichloromethane, followed by dissolution in acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid, and purification by an MCX column. The extracts were analyzed by LC–MS/MS in multiple reaction monitoring and positive modes with a C18 column; elution was carried out with a gradient of 0.1% formic acid and methanol containing 0.1% formic acid. The limits of detection for TBT, TPT, DBT, and DPT were 0.1, 0.6, 0.8, and 0.3μgkg−1, respectively. The recovery of organotins in spiked samples ranged from 68% to 113% (relative standard deviation: 0.4–4.2%).

"maritime availability of bds/gnss araim in the arctic","2022","High-integrity navigation as an essential prerequisite of activity is worthy of being investigated in the Arctic, which can be achieved based on Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS). The integrity performance of navigation in the arctic should be analyzed based on Beidou/GNSS in the arctic using Advanced Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (ARAIM) technology. Three different harbors in the Arctic were selected to simulate the changes of HPL under different combinations of constellation systems. The average distribution trend of HPL and availability at the polar region is also analyzed by using Stanford University's MASST software. The results show that the combination of two constellation systems can only meet the integrity requirements of ocean or coastal navigation. The availability of ARIAM is further improved using the combination of the three or four constellations, which can meet the high-integrity requirements of the ice navigation in the Arctic. In the case of BDS+Galileo+GLONASS and BDS+Galileo+GPS, the average HPL is 7.69m and 7.63m respectively. Using BDS+Galileo+GLONASS+GPS, its average HPL is 6.26m.

"security analysis of drones systems: attacks, limitations, and recommendations","2020","Recently, the world witnessed a significant increase in the number of used drones, with a global and continuous rise in the demand for their multi-purpose applications. The pervasive aspect of these drones is due to their ability to answer people’s needs. Drones are providing users with a bird’s eye that can be activated and used almost anywhere and at any time. However, recently, the malicious use of drones began to emerge among criminals and cyber-criminals alike. The probability and frequency of these attacks are both high and their impact can be very dangerous with devastating effects. Therefore, the need for detective, protective and preventive counter-measures is highly required. The aim of this survey is to investigate the emerging threats of using drones in cyber-attacks, along the countermeasures to thwart these attacks. The different uses of drones for malicious purposes are also reviewed, along the possible detection methods. As such, this paper analyzes the exploitation of drones vulnerabilities within communication links, as well as smart devices and hardware, including smart-phones and tablets. Moreover, this paper presents a detailed review on the drone/Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) usage in multiple domains (i.e civilian, military, terrorism, etc.) and for different purposes. A realistic attack scenario is also presented, which details how the authors performed a simulated attack on a given drone following the hacking cycle. This review would greatly help ethical hackers to understand the existing vulnerabilities of UAVs in both military and civilian domains. Moreover, it allows them to adopt and come up with new techniques and technologies for enhanced UAV attack detection and protection. As a result, various civilian and military anti-drones/UAVs (detective and preventive) countermeasures will be reviewed.","Drones security,Terrorism/counter-Terrorism,Drones security countermeasures techniques,Drones threats and vulnerabilities,Drones forensics,Drone/UAV warfare,UAS,Drones attacks,UAV,UUV,Armed drones,"
"detecting small infrared maritime targets overwhelmed in heavy waves by weighted multidirectional gradient measure","2022","Efficient small infrared (IR) maritime target detection in heavy waves is a key and challenging task in maritime distress target search and rescue systems. The current methods are struggling to enhance targets and suppress heavy waves because of the similar local contrast. In this letter, a weighted multidirectional gradient (WMDG) measure is presented. First, the candidate targets are extracted via facet model. Then multidirectional gradient and difference information are constructed to calculate average cumulative multidirectional gradient (ACMG) and achieve directional difference measure (DDM). Consequently, the final saliency is reconstructed via ACMG weighted by DDM. Finally, the actual targets are segmented through an adaptive threshold. Experimental results demonstrate that our method is superior to the state-of-the-art methods with regard to detection validity and robustness for small IR maritime target detection in heavy waves.","robustness,Computed tomography,image denoising,infrared (IR) maritime image,detection validity,Directional difference,similar local contrast,small infrared maritime target detection,Feature extraction,Sea measurements,rescue systems,image colour analysis,marine engineering,DDM,object detection,small target detection,multidirectional gradient,directional difference measure,Robustness,average cumulative multidirectional gradient,gradient methods,infrared imaging,heavy waves,maritime distress target search,Clutter,Object detection,IR maritime target detection,weighted multidirectional gradient measure,candidate targets,ACMG,Weight measurement,difference information,"
"permeability and voids influence on the thermal signal, as inferred by multitemporal uav-based infrared and visible images","2020","This work presents for the first time associated thermal anomalies and deformations over subsurface cavities/voids located within two harbour quays in Le Havre Harbourg, Normandy, France. An U.A.V. (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) was used to acquire visible and thermal images over a diurnal cycle (from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m.). The visible images were processed to realize an altimetric model of the platforms by mean of the photogrammetric method, while the thermal infrared (TIR) images were used to study the evolution of their surface temperatures. The obtained 3D model shows the location of five topographic depressions on both quays. The analysis of the evolution of the surface thermal field leads to the detection of cold thermal anomalies that are (1) not correlated to surface properties, and (2) spatially associated to the flanks of the five topographic depressions. Using a 2D conductive-radiative model, we show that these anomalies are not directly due to the thermally insulating effect of an air-filled area. Finally, we conclude that preferential infiltration and subsequent evaporation in the micro-fracturation present within the flanks of the depressions may be responsible for the strong cooling of these zones.","Thermal infrared,Photogrammetry,Remote Sensing,infiltration,Subsurface cavity,Natural hazards,UAV,"

Therefore, simulations are frequently the only way to perform adequate testing for such DC grids. In order to prevent excessive computation times, it is necessary to carefully balance complexity and accuracy of the simulation. The occurring trade-off between taking risks and oversizing the system is a critical choice. Since novel DC grids have a stronger bidirectionality and additional a certain degree of enmeshment, the influence of these properties on the required simulation complexity is analyzed in this paper.

"what is going on within google earth engine? a systematic review and meta-analysis","2023","Google Earth Engine (GEE) is a geospatial processing platform based on geo-information applications in the ‘cloud’. This platform provides free access to huge volumes of satellite data for computing, and offers support tools to monitor and analyse environmental features on a large scale. Such facilities have been widely used in numerous studies about land management and planning. Considering the current lack of relevant overviews, it may be useful to evaluate the utilization paths of GEE and its impact on the scientific community. For this purpose, a systematic review has been conducted using the PRISMA methodology based on 343 articles published from 2020 to 2022 in high-impact scientific journals, selected from the Scopus and Google Scholar databases. After an overview of the publishing context, an analysis of the frequency of satellite features, processing methods, applications are carried out, and a special attention is given to the COVID-19 studies. Finally, the geographical distribution of the reviewed articles is evaluated, and the citation impact metrics is analysed. On a bibliometric approach, 90 journals published articles on GEE in the reference period (January 2020 to April 2022), and this large number of journals reveals the multidisciplinary application of GEE platform as well as the interest of publishers towards this topic of relevance for the international scientific community. The results of the meta-analysis following the systematic review showed that: (i) the Landsat 8 was the most widely-used satellite (25%); (i) the non-parametric classification methods, mainly Random Forest, were the most recurrent algorithms (31%); and (iii) the water resources assessment and prediction were the most common methodological applications (22%).

"directional wave climate and power variability along the southeast australian shelf","2015","Variability in the modal wave climate is a key process driving large-scale coastal behaviour on moderate- to high-energy sandy coastlines, and is strongly related to variability in synoptic climate drivers. On sub-tropical coasts, shifts in the sub-tropical ridge (STR) modulate the seasonal occurrence of different wave types. However, in semi-enclosed seas, isolating directional wave climates and synoptic drivers is hindered by a complex mixed sea-swell environment. Here we present a directional wave climate typology for the Tasman Sea based on a combined statistical-synoptic approach using mid-shelf wave buoy observations along the Southeast Australian Shelf (SEAS). Five synoptic-scale wave climates exist during winter, and six during summer. These can be clustered into easterly (Tradewind), south-easterly (Tasman Sea) and southerly (Southern Ocean) wave types, each with distinct wave power signatures. We show that a southerly shift in the STR and trade-wind zone, consistent with an observed poleward expansion of the tropics, forces an increase in the total wave energy flux in winter for the central New South Wales shelf of 1.9GJm–1 wave-crest-length for 1° southerly shift in the STR, and a reduction of similar magnitude (approximately 1.8GJm–1) during summer. In both seasons there is an anti-clockwise rotation of wave power towards the east and south-east at the expense of southerly waves. Reduced obliquity of constructive wave power would promote a general disruption to northward alongshore sediment transport, with the cross-shore component becoming increasingly prevalent. Results are of global relevance to sub-tropical east coasts where the modal wave climate is influenced by the position of the zonal STR.","Wave climate,Cluster analysis,Wave power,Sub-tropical ridge,Tasman Sea,Southeast Australia,"
"security and qos issues in blockchain enabled next-generation smart logistic networks: a tutorial","2022","The blockchain-enabled smart logistics market is expected to grow worth USD 1620 billion and at a compound annual growth rate of 62.4%. Smart logistics ensures intelligence infrastructure, logistics automation, real-time analysis of supply chain data synchronization of the logistics process, cost transparency, unbroken shipment tracking all the way down to the transportation route, etc. In the smart logistics domain, significant advancement and growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) sensors are evident. However, the connectivity of IoT systems, including Tactile Internet, without proper safeguards creates vulnerabilities that can still be deliberately or inadvertently cause disruption. In view of this, we primarily notice two key issues. Firstly, the logistics domain can be compromised by a variety of natural or man-made activities, which eventually affect the overall network security. Secondly, there are thousands of entities in the supply chain network that use extensive machine-learning algorithms in many scenarios, and they require high-power computational resources. From these two challenges, we note that the first concern can be addressed by adding blockchain to IoT logistic networks. The second issue can be addressed using 6G. This will support 1-μs latency communications, support seamless computing at the edges of networks, and autonomously predict the best optimal location for edge computing. Motivated by this, we have highlighted motivational examples to show the necessity to integrate 6G and blockchain in smart logistic networks. Then, we have proposed a 6G and blockchain-enabled smart logistic high-level framework. We have presented the key intrinsic issues of this framework mainly from the security and resource management context. In this paper, recent state-of-the-art advances in blockchain enabled next-generation smart logistic networks are analyzed. We have also examined why 6G and not 5G would be compatible with the smart network. We have introduced five different use cases of blockchain technology in smart logistics.

"early 20th century warming in the arctic: a review","2011","From the 1920s to the 1940s, the Artic experienced significant warming that is comparable to the recent 30-year warming. The former warming was concentrated mostly in high latitudes, in contrast to the recent 30-year warming, which has occurred in all latitudes. Several explanations have been proposed; however, one of these proposed explanations, single external forcing, which could once explain the global average, failed to explain the early 20th century scenario. A second possible explanation was internal atmospheric variability with low frequency. Another candidate for the explanation was still forcing by black carbon deposited on snow and ice surfaces. The answer is most likely to be a combination of intrinsic internal natural climate variability and positive feedbacks that amplified the radiative and atmospheric forcing. We must continue our study by discovering historical data, analyzing ice cores, reanalyzing the Arctic system together with long-term reanalysis dating back to the 1880s, and also determine the contributions of each factor.","Early 20th century warming,Climate forcing,Internal variability,Arctic,"

The developed hyperspectral imaging classification methods are based on supervised approaches and allow to detect the presence of vessels using real hyperspectral data. We implemented two different methods for comparison purposes: SVM and SAM. The SVM method, which can be considered one of most utilized methods for image classification, was implemented using linear, RBF, sigmoid and polynomial kernels with PCA for dimensionality reduction, and compared with SAM using a two classes definition, namely vessel and water. The obtained results using real data collected from a UAV allow to conclude that the SVM approach is suitable for detecting the vessel presence in the water with a precision and recall rates favorable when compared to SAM.","Kernel,Support vector machines,PCA,vessel presence,Hyperspectral imaging,maritime operational scenarios,UAV maritime target detection,hyperspectral imaging classification methods,geophysical image processing,supervised classification,support vector machines,object detection,image classification,autonomous aerial vehicles,Training,Unmanned aerial vehicles,hyperspectral image system,SAM,Tuning,SVM method,SVM approach,principal component analysis,radial basis function networks,hyperspectral data,"
"analysis and design of cubesat constellation for the mediterranean south costal monitoring against illegal immigration","2018","Costal monitoring is focused on fast response to illegal immigration and illegal ship traffic. Especially, the illegal ship traffic has been present in media since April 2015, as the number of reported deaths of immigrants crossing the Mediterranean significantly increased. Satellite images provide a possibility to at least partially control both types of events. This paper defines the principal criteria to select the best satellite constellation architecture for maritime and coastal monitoring, filling the gaps of imagery techniques in term of real-time control. The primary purpose of a constellation is to obtain global measurement improving the temporal resolution. The small size and low-cost are the main factors, which make CubeSats ideal for use in constellations. We propose a constellation of 9 Cubesats distributed evenly in 3 different planes. This reduces the revisit time enhancing the coverage duration. In addition, it also allows observing fire, damage on building and similar disasters. In this analysis, the performance criteria were reported such as the revisit time, the vision duration and the area coverage.","Revisit time,CubeSat,Constellation,Coverage,"
"underwater archaeological investigation using ground penetrating radar: a case analysis of shanglinhu yue kiln sites (china)","2018","In this study we explored the possibility and effectiveness of applying ground penetrating radar (GPR) to investigate underwater cultural relics. Using this innovative technique, the remains of Yue kiln and anomalous objects buried beneath the lake or suspended in the water can now be fully studied. Although GPR has been widely used for imaging archaeological sites, skepticism remains over its use in underwater archaeology. Nevertheless, some scholars suggest that it is possible to use GPR to detect underwater remains, which has been further confirmed by the use of electrical parameter measurement (EPM) in Shanglinhu Lake. An experiment was performed by our team using antennas of different frequencies in a particular area of the lake. The results showed that the penetrability of the 100 MHz antenna was enough to examine the targets, while the 400 MHz antenna performed well in shallow water (depth <4 m) due to higher resolution. Hence, for our underwater investigation, we used both antennas for maximum coverage. We used a radargram as a topographic map which shows cross sections of the lake. Analysis of the Shanglinhu Lake data indicated that GPR is a superior tool for underwater archaeological investigation. Traditional methods including sonar, underwater cameras and salvage dives were used as supporting techniques in the study.","Underwater archaeological investigation,Ground penetrating radar,Yue kiln remains,"
"one-dimensional spectral analysis of aeromagnetic data from temiscouata area and the western sector of the gulf of st. lawrence","1979","1-D spectral analysis is useful to determine the mean depths to buried magnetic Precambrian basement rocks. The average thickness of the sedimentary cover which may contain favourable petroleum reservoirs overlying the basement of the Northern Appalachians of Quebec was determined by this method. Additional information related to structural geology of the basement and the sedimentary cover can also be obtained with this technique. The center of the Temiscouata area is located at longitude 69° W and latitude 47° 45′ N and the one of the Gulf at 67° 45′ W and 49° 05′ N. The aeromagnetic data were digitized from the 1 mile = 1 inch total field contour maps published by EMR. In the digitization process, the magnetic intensities were read on contour lines only. Interpolation at fixed intervals were calculated with the help of a computer program subroutine. The fixed intervals were chosen at 0.25, 0.50 on shore and 1.00 mile offshore in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. The magnetic gradient was removed using the IGRF formula or numerical filters. The least square method was avoided because of the biasing it involves. Additional smoothing was occasionally done. After these different steps were executed, the transformation to obtain the Fourier co-efficients was carried out using an algorithm for computing the Mixed Radix Fast Fourier Transform. Mean depths are then calculated from the energy spectra; this constitutes a statistical approach. The mean depths obtained from the 1-D energy spectrum are comparable within 10–15% with the ones obtained from the 2-D energy spectrum. 1-D spectral analysis of AM data offers some advantages on the 2-D counterpart. Among these, we can mention the eventuality of obtaining mean depths to the basement from the analysis of only a few AM flight lines in a new area and of detailing more accurately structural features of local nature in the basement. Such structural features may be controlling agents in eventual reservoirs within the sedimentary rocks.",""
"hourly composition of gas and particle phase pollutants at a central urban background site in milan, italy","2017","A comprehensive range of gas and particle phase pollutants were sampled at 1-hour time resolution in urban background Milan during summer 2012. Measurements include several soluble inorganic aerosols (Cl−,NO2−,NO3−,SO42−,Ca2+,K+,Mg2+,Na+,NH4+) and gases (HCl, HNO2,HNO3, NH3, NO, NO2,O3, SO2), organic, elemental and black carbon and meteorological parameters. Analysis methods used include mean diurnal pattern on weekdays and Sundays, pollution roses, bivariate polar plots and statistical models using backtrajectories. Results show how nitrous acid (HONO) was mainly formed heterogeneously at nighttime, with a dependence of its formation rate on NO2 consistent with observations during the last HONO campaign in Milan in summer 1998, although since 1998 a drop in HONO levels occurred following to the decrease of its precursors. Nitrate showed two main formation mechanisms: one occurring through N2O5 at nighttime and leading to nitrate formation onto existing particles; another occurring both daytime and nighttime following the homogeneous reaction of ammonia gas with nitric acid gas. Air masses reaching Milan influenced nitrate formation depending on their content in ammonia and the timing of arrival. Notwithstanding the low level of SO2 in Milan, its peaks were associated to point source emissions in the Po valley or shipping and power plant emissions SW of Milan, beyond the Apennines. A distinctive pattern for HCl was observed, featured by an afternoon peak and a morning minimum, and best correlated to atmospheric temperature, although it was not possible to identify any specific source. The ratio of primary-dominated organic carbon and elemental carbon on hourly PM2.5 resulted 1.7. Black carbon was highly correlated to elemental carbon and the average mass absorption coefficient resulted MAC=13.8 ± 0.2 m2 g−1. It is noteworthy how air quality for a large metropolitan area, in a confined valley and under enduring atmospheric stability, is nonetheless influenced by sources within and outside the valley.","Gas-phase pollutants,Po valley,PM,Hourly ionic composition,"

"decarbonizing primary steel production : techno-economic assessment of a hydrogen based green steel production plant in norway","2022","High electricity cost is the biggest challenge faced by the steel industry in transitioning to hydrogen based steelmaking. A steel plant in Norway could have access to cheap, emission free electricity, high-quality iron ore, skilled manpower, and the European market. An open-source model for conducting techno-economic assessment of a hydrogen based steel manufacturing plant, operating in Norway has been developed in this work. Levelized cost of production (LCOP) for two plant configurations; one procuring electricity at a fixed price, and the other procuring electricity from the day-ahead electricity markets, with different electrolyzer capacity were analyzed. LCOP varied from $622/tls to $722/tls for the different plant configurations. Procuring electricity from the day-ahead electricity markets could reduce the LCOP by 15%. Increasing the electrolyzer capacity reduced the operational costs, but increased the capital investments, reducing the overall advantage. Sensitivity analysis revealed that electricity price and iron ore price are the major contributors to uncertainty for configurations with fixed electricity prices. For configurations with higher electrolyzer capacity, changes in the iron ore price and parameters related to capital investment were found to affect the LCOP significantly.","Optimization,Industrial decarbonization,Green steel,Norway,Water electrolysis,Hydrogen direct reduction,Day ahead electricity market,Climate change,"
"towards low-visibility enhancement in maritime video surveillance: an efficient and effective multi-deep neural network","2021","Limited by insufficient illumination, the images collected by maritime imaging devices often suffer from low brightness, low contrast, low signal-to-noise ratio, severe information loss, and so on. The above problems restrict the development of maritime- related work such as intelligent supervision, collision warning, accident investigation, etc. To improve the imaging quality of maritime video images, we propose an efficient and effective multi-deep neural network (termed EEMNN) for low-visibility enhancement. In particular, we fuse the multi-scale information extracted from the encoder-decoder module using the dense blocks (DBs) and attention blocks (ABs). It is capable of enhancing the fused information leading to preserving the edges, textures, and other fine details. To prevent the overexposure of enhanced images, we fuse and reconstruct the output features of DBs and ABs with the raw low-light image to get the final enhanced image through two residual blocks (RBs). The mixing of multiple network modules can effectively improve the generalization ability and robustness of our network. Through extensive experiments, EEMNN has higher objective evaluation indicators, more efficient enhancement, more natural maritime scenes, and stronger detail-preservation capabilities compared with other enhancement methods.","efficient and effective multideep neural network,natural maritime scenes,image denoising,Lighting,deep learning (artificial intelligence),Feature extraction,low-visibility enhancement,image enhancement,Neural networks,encoder-decoder module,insufficient illumination,attention blocks,dense blocks,information fusion,image colour analysis,ABs,residual blocks,image fusion,maritime video images,low-light image,object detection,intelligent supervision,feature extraction,image texture,multiple network modules,Video surveillance,stronger detail-preservation capabilities,video signal processing,Robustness,marine engineering computing,Fuses,DBs,Imaging,video surveillance,multiscale information,maritime imaging devices,maritime video surveillance,"
"environmental impact of disposal of coal mining wastes on soils and plants in rostov oblast, russia","2018","Underground coal mining in Southern European Russia leads to soil cover destruction in areas directly occupied by spoil tips and rock dumps located nearby. Coal producing areas in Rostov Oblast were selected for a detailed consideration. Soil samples were taken from the uppermost horizons: a layer of 0–10cm of spoil tips and surrounding areas, as well as from 1.5m depth vertical soil profiles. The soil samples were analysed for mineral composition, particle-size distribution and gross contents of Cu, Zn, Pb, Ag, Sn, Mo, Ba, Co, Ni, Mn, Ti, V, Cr, Ga, P, Li, Sr, Y, Yb, Nb, Sc and Zr, using emission spectral analysis. The plant species of mining influenced areas were described. The process of Technosol formation at the waste sites was considered separately. Soils have not yet formed as a result of a self-restoration on the spoil tips aged more than 50years and burnt-out decades ago. A vegetation cover, which emerged during this time range, practically does not support the progress of any considerable soil-forming process. The ponds formed by the flooding of burning spoil tips, do not give the possibility for the formation of soils and hardly contribute to plant growth. The surface layers of spoil tips at all stages of their development are different from the surrounding steppe soils in geochemical characteristics and mineralogical composition. The atmospheric and water inflow of material from spoil tips changes (in the cases studied - worsens) a state of steppe soils within a radius of 1 km, and leads to the increase of heavy metal content in these soils.","Geochemical impact assessment,Heavy metals,Technogenic anomalies,Soil pollution,"
"observation needs for climate information, prediction and application: capabilities of existing and future observing systems","2010","The demand for long-term, sustained, reliable data and derived information on climate and its changes has never been greater than today. Long-term, well-calibrated, global observations of Essential Climate Variables (ECV) such as air temperature, precipitation, and sea-surface temperature are critical for defining the evolving state of the Earth's climate. Observing systems routinely collect much of the required data covering 49 ECVs, and significant progress has been made in coverage and technological capability over the two decades since the Second World Climate Conference. However, many key regions and climatic zones remain poorly observed, and gaps are widening in some cases. Supporting infrastructures for data stewardship and analysis are largely in place but require strengthening, while those for linking with socio-economic data and for providing user-oriented information services require more substantial development. The current capabilities are summarized, and further actions are identified to ensure that climate observation activities more fully meet the needs of science and society. The Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) was established in 1992 with the goal of providing comprehensive information on the total climate system, involving a multidisciplinary range of physical, chemical and biological observations of the atmosphere, oceans and land. GCOS is a “system of systems” that builds on the climate-relevant components of existing observing systems, and relies almost entirely upon national efforts to maintain and enhance those systems. Contributing systems include the World Meteorological Organization Global Observing System (GOS) for meteorology, its Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW) for atmospheric composition, the Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS), led by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC), and the Global Terrestrial Observing System (GTOS), led by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). GCOS itself is the climate observing system within the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) developed under the auspices of the Group on Earth Observations (GEO). The established in situ networks and space-based components must be sustained and operated with ongoing attention to data quality in accordance with the GCOS Climate Monitoring Principles; enhancements must be made for some types of observations; the exchange of observations and delivery of data and information to users must be ensured; reprocessing and reanalysis must be strengthened; and national and international coordination must be improved. The consequence of not meeting these requirements would be to seriously compromise the information on, and predictions of, climate variability and change. Detailed information on GCOS and the datasets that are produced as a result of GCOS observing activities can be found at the Global Observing Systems Information Center (GOSIC) at http://gosic.org.","GEOSS,climate observations,GEO,ECV,GAW,GTOS,GOOS,essential climate variables,GCOS,"
"improved visualization of large temporal series for the evaluation of good environmental status","2019","Passive acoustic monitoring of underwater sounds is an emerging discipline that can be used to guarantee that anthropogenic noise meets acceptable limits, to detect the presence of cetacean species, and to ensure sustainable exploitation of our oceans and seas. In this scenario, graphical representation techniques play a key role in helping to reveal seasonal structures of human made noises. Nevertheless, for very long temporal series, it might be challenging to find a graphic visualization technique that allows representing a time range that is long enough to capture these seasonal events, while at the same time preserving short isolated events. We propose a framework for the creation of such visualization techniques and analyze the different stages involved: data reduction, color encoding, and signal processing on graphs. All of this is applied to data from deployments in two marine protected areas in order to provide an acoustic panorama and identify seasonal events.","Submarine environment,Hough transform,Ambient noise characterization,Data reduction,Surveillance,Big data visualization,Acoustic images,"
"coincident high resolution optical-sar image analysis for surface albedo estimation of first-year sea ice during summer melt","2007","The parameterization of sea ice albedo during summer, when fluctuations in the fractional coverage of melt ponds change on a variety of spatial and temporal scales, represents a significant challenge for both the modelling and remote sensing communities. Ubiquitous cloud cover in summer inhibits the use of optical sensors for providing large-scale estimates of sea ice surface albedo. C-band (5.3 GHz) Synthetic Aperture RADAR (SAR) data from ENVISAT-ASAR is compared to coincident surface climatological albedo (α) estimates derived from high-resolution Quickbird VIS-NIR imagery in order to demonstrate the utility of high-resolution, dual-polarized (VV, HH) SAR for detecting variations in α of melt pond covered landfast first-year sea ice (FYI) adjacent to Hudson Bay. Variations in ice α are detected from SAR imagery using the co-polarization ratio (γ), shown to be significantly correlated (−0.81) with α when melt ponds are in liquid form. Results show the use of γ represents a substantial increase in correlation to α when compared to conventional like-polarized SAR backscattering coefficients. A regression model demonstrates that γ can be used as an estimator for landfast-FYI α to within ±5.2% provided: (1) The SAR images at a shallow enough incidence angle to induce separation between like-polarized channels; and (2) the conditions of Bragg surface scattering, characteristic of relatively shallow FYI melt ponds, is met.","Melt ponds,Microwave scattering,Sea ice,Synthethic aperture radar,Albedo,"

Thus the anisotropy of the wood should be taken into account when the ground-penetrating radar (GPR) technique is used to explore the properties of timber. The work carried out analyzes, by means of a GPR with a 1.6 GHz antenna, the dielectric behavior of Maritime Pine timber according to the direction of the electrical field with respect to the grain. After the acquisition process, the propagation velocities, amplitudes, and spectra variations were compared for all the studied grain directions. Significant differences were found between these parameters when the field was propagated in a parallel direction compared with perpendicular to the grain.

"variability of lightning flash and thunderstorm over east/southeast asia on the enso time scales","2016","The variability of lightning flash and thunderstorm on the ENSO time scales over East/Southeast Asia was investigated by using 17-year (1995–2011) lightning data from the Optical Transient Detector (OTD) and Lightning Imaging Sensor (LIS), and 14-year (1998–2011) Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission satellite (TRMM) precipitation feature data. In addition, ERA-Interim reanalysis data of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) were used to present related environmental characteristics. It was found that the response of lightning flash to ENSO events shows remarkable seasonal and regional variations. The regions of positive (negative) lightning anomaly are mainly located at both sides of 5°–20°N (5°–15°N) in El Niño (La Niña) spring and winter, and located north of the equator in summer and autumn. There is a significantly positive correlation between lightning anomaly and the Oceanic Niño Index (ONI) over both East China and Indonesia during El Niño episodes, but no obvious correlation during La Niña episodes. The positive thunderstorm anomalies during El Niño periods are dispersed. The distribution of thunderstorm anomalies in La Niña summer and autumn is almost opposite to that in spring and winter. The correlation between thunderstorm anomaly and ONI is better over East China than that over Indonesia. In general, lightning variation follows thunderstorm intensity (number) variation over East China during El Niño (La Niña) episodes, and follows a combination of thunderstorm intensity and number variations over Indonesia on ENSO time scales. During ENSO time scales, variations of surface wind can be considered as one of the key factors to LAs. More lightning flashes present in the regions where warm moist flows intersection, and less in the regions where surface wind changes slightly or diverges. Dramatic lightning increases also occur with higher values of convective available potential energy (CAPE). In addition, higher (lower) 850hPa relative humidity generally follows with more (less) lightning flashes, which is more obvious during El Niño episodes.","Lightning,ENSO,East/Southeast Asia,Meteorological factor,Thunderstorm,"

"viirs environmental data record and deep blue aerosol products: validation, comparison, and spatiotemporal variations from 2013 to 2018 in china","2021","Recently, the Deep Blue (DB) algorithm has been successfully applied to the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) to expend the long-term aerosol records over land in conjunction with the Environmental Data Record (EDR) product. However, the overall accuracy and uncertainty of VIIRS DB and EDR Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) products are still unclear in China, in particular, due to the sparse distribution of ground observation stations. Therefore, the objective of this study is to evaluate and compare VIIRS EDR and DB AOD retrievals against ground measurements collected from both Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) and Chinese Sun-sky radiometer Observation Network (SONET) in China from 2013 to 2018. Results suggest that both EDR and DB products have a significant refinement after quality assurance (QA) controlling. DB (QA = Best) performs best with high correction (R = 0.92), and up to 80.32% of AOD matches falling within the expected error (EE), while approximately 46% of EDR (QA = Best) AOD retrievals are overestimated. However, EDR has a higher retrieval frequency than DB over most regions of China, except for the arid and semi-arid areas such as the Northwest. Generally, despite some exceptions, both EDR and DB products perform relatively poorly in summer for all statistics. Furthermore, the error analysis explains that DB is less sensitive to varying air pollution levels, diverse aerosol types, and different surface conditions, while the pattern of EDR is complicated. In addition, due to the common algorithmic heritage, both VIIRS EDR and MODIS DT products only show good matching over dark surfaces, while VIIRS DB and MODIS DB algorithms have good performance over both dark and bright surfaces. Finally, both EDR and DB products have shown significant downward AOD trends equal to −0.0008 per year (p < 0.01) in China during the last past six years, especially for three typical urban agglomerations. These evaluation results are expected to provide appropriate guidance for the application of VIIRS aerosol products in China.",""
"what are the hydro-meteorological controls on flood characteristics?","2017","Flood events can be expressed by a variety of characteristics such as flood magnitude and extent, event duration or incurred loss. Flood estimation and management may benefit from understanding how the different flood characteristics relate to the hydrological catchment conditions preceding the event and to the meteorological conditions throughout the event. In this study, we therefore propose a methodology to investigate the hydro-meteorological controls on different flood characteristics, based on the simulation of the complete flood risk chain from the flood triggering precipitation event, through runoff generation in the catchment, flood routing and possible inundation in the river system and floodplains to flood loss. Conditional cumulative distribution functions and regression tree analysis delineate the seasonal varying flood processes and indicate that the effect of the hydrological pre-conditions, i.e. soil moisture patterns, and of the meteorological conditions, i.e. weather patterns, depends on the considered flood characteristic. The methodology is exemplified for the Elbe catchment. In this catchment, the length of the build-up period, the event duration and the number of gauges undergoing at least a 10-year flood are governed by weather patterns. The affected length and the number of gauges undergoing at least a 2-year flood are however governed by soil moisture patterns. In case of flood severity and loss, the controlling factor is less pronounced. Severity is slightly governed by soil moisture patterns whereas loss is slightly governed by weather patterns. The study highlights that flood magnitude and extent arise from different flood generation processes and concludes that soil moisture patterns as well as weather patterns are not only beneficial to inform on possible flood occurrence but also on the involved flood processes and resulting flood characteristics.","Soil moisture patterns,Flood magnitude,Flood,Flood duration,Antecedent conditions,Weather patterns,Large basins,Flood loss,"
"gas - escape features along the trzebiatów fault offshore poland: evidence for a leaking petroleum system","2023","New 2D high-resolution seismic and hydro-acoustic data demonstrate the presence of methane in the shallow sediments and its origin in the Pomeranian Bight, south of the Baltic Sea area. Various shallow gas features including chimneys, bright spots, acoustic blanking, pockmarks, and polarity reversal were identified in the Gryfice block, along the inverted Trzebiatów fault zone. Structural and stratigraphic interpretation with support of seismic attributes shows the potential of fluid migration pathways from the Upper Triassic formation reservoirs to shallow sediments below the seafloor. It also helps in the explanation of how this natural gas escapes to the sea bottom. Amplitude-vs-offset (AVO) analysis proved free gas existence in the potential Upper Triassic reservoir, and helped locate free gas deposits within sediments. Hydro-acoustic data illustrated the gas chimneys’ anomalies and the corresponding free gas accumulation in Pleistocene to Quaternary successions. Leaking of gas to the seafloor was also proved by the exposure of pockmarks on multibeam (bathymetry) data at the seafloor. We combine seismic, hydro-acoustic data, and information on petroleum system from previous studies to explain the signatures of free gas and its migration from lower reservoirs to shallow sediments.","Hydro-acoustics,Petroleum system,Shallow gas,Reflection seismic,Fluid escape,"

Research techniques of human factors related to neurophysiological measurements are analyzed in the context of ship operators' behaviors.

"gis-based identification of spatial variables enhancing heat and poor air quality in urban areas","2012","Due to anthropogenic climate change heat waves are expected to occur more frequently in the future, which might cause adverse health effects for urban population. Especially the combination of high temperatures and poor air quality impinges on the well-being of man. This accentuates the need for assessing the health risks of residents regarding air pollutants and anomalously high summer air temperatures. However, comprehensive information on the spatial and temporal distribution of temperature and particulate matter (PM) concentration in cities are presently difficult to obtain since only few measurement sites exist. In order to identify hot spots with high health risks for distinct groups of urban population, measurement campaigns were carried out, capturing the spatial distribution of temperature and PM concentrations in the City of Aachen, Germany (pop. 245,000). Several locations were selected to examine spatial influences such as topography, building density, vegetation and traffic on temperature and PM. The findings permit the detection of urban environmental variables that contribute to both temperature enhancement and poor air quality. Those variables were used as spatial predictors for the identification of possible hot spots inside and outside the area of field measurements. The zones of enhanced risks of high air temperature and PM levels were detected by means of GIS based geo-statistic modeling. These areas were mainly identified in the inner city, which is characterized by a dense building structure and heavy traffic. A chemical characterization of different PM fractions complements the GIS based investigations. The analysis of toxicologically relevant components provides information on air quality at urban, suburban and rural sites.

"multi-scale analysis reveals changing distribution patterns and the influence of social structure on the habitat use of an endangered marine predator, the sperm whale physeter macrocephalus in the western mediterranean sea","2020","The habitat use of marine megafauna emerges from the complex interplay between access to patchy and variable food resources and several intrinsic biological factors, such as the interaction with conspecifics and offspring care, resulting in dynamic distribution patterns. Quantifying species' relationships with the underlying environment is further complicated by the scale-dependent nature of these processes. Multi-scale analyses that incorporate aspects of a species' biology and build on large datasets are therefore required to understand long-term distribution and inform appropriate management measures. In this study, we use monitoring data collected over two study periods (2003–2008 and 2012–2018) to assess the habitat use, trend in local occurrence, and change in distribution of sperm whales, Physeter macrocephalus, around the Balearic Islands (Spain), one of the few recognised breeding and feeding grounds for the ‘Endangered’ population in the Mediterranean Sea. Moreover, we investigate the differences in the habitat use of single animals and groups, to explore intra-specific niche partitioning in this highly social but behaviourally dimorphic species. Results suggest that overall the occurrence of sperm whales in the area has been increasing over time. Animals were found to associate with distinct bathymetric features, but the mechanisms generating these relationships, and the underlying oceanographic processes within this habitat, remained uncertain. Sperm whale distribution also underwent a significant shift between the two study periods, with an increased occurrence in the Mallorca channel and north of Menorca, which further points towards a dynamic use of the broader bathymetric range preferred around the archipelago. Finally, our analyses highlighted that single animals and groups used areas with different characteristics, with groups preferring deeper, warmer waters characterised by lower sea level anomaly, which resulted in some fine-scale spatial segregation. The results of this study shed light on the mechanisms underpinning the biogeography and complex social system of the species, and support the design of targeted conservation measures in this important breeding and feeding ground.","Mediterranean sea,Distribution shift,Balearic archipelago,Sperm whale,Long-term monitoring,Habitat modeling,"
"a fuzzy graph-based segmentation for marine and maritime applications in sar images","2015","In the context of sea monitoring, an important processing step is image segmentation. In this paper, the authors propose a new segmentation method that combines fuzzy and graph-based theories. The algorithm, starting from a single source element belonging to the region of interest, proceeds with a propagation mechanism that aims at finding a Minimum Path Spanning Tree (MPST). The process is automatic, unsupervised, adaptive to the image content and independent from the order of analysis. A TerraSAR-X image and Cosmo-SkyMed images are used for the experiments. The considered applications are oil spill detection, sea surface analysis, and ship detection.","TerraSAR-X image,SAR images,Marine vehicles,Monitoring,Cost function,fuzzy connectedness,Synthetic aperture radar,MPST,Automatic segmentation,trees (mathematics),fuzzy graph-based segmentation,graph-based theory,synthetic aperture radar,Sea surface,radar imaging,Context,maritime applications,propagation mechanism,fuzzy set theory,Image segmentation,minimum path spanning tree,sea monitoring,image segmentation,Cosmo-SkyMed images,"

"texture based image retrieval and classification of very high resolution maritime pine forest images","2013","Textural analysis can bring valuable information in the classification or the segmentation process of land covers displaying regular patterns in very high resolution remotely sensed images. In this study, we investigate how features extracted by multivariate modeling of the local spatial dependence in the wavelet domain can efficiently capture the textural content of maritime pine forest images in comparison with a commonly used texture analysis approach, the GLCM. To evaluate the performances of the tested methods, we used a content based image retrieval framework and created a database of image patches representing different development stages of the forest stands. Results show that multivariate models display higher retrieval rates than GLCM-based methods with yet a higher sensitivity to the dominant orientation in anisotropic textures. These observations open up new perspectives in the use of multivariate modeling for textural features extraction in very high resolution image classification.","wavelet domain,Remote sensing,forest,Vectors,textural feature,image retrieval framework,Feature extraction,geophysical techniques,geophysical image processing,maritime pine forest images,very high resolution,textural analysis,land cover classification process,texture based image classification,land cover,image classification,multivariate models,land cover segmentation process,image patch database,vegetation,Object oriented modeling,texture based image retrieval,Image resolution,remotely sensed images,image segmentation,Image retrieval,GLCM,GLCM-based methods,"
"efficacy evaluation of maritime aton by fuzzy ahp approach","2019","The maritime Aids to Navigation (AtoN) plays a vital role in ensuring safety and efficiency of the water transport. The efficacy evaluation of AtoN is closely associated with the arrangement of navigation aids in both river and port waters. Qualitative description methods are known as convenient but sometimes subjective. A few attempts in the literature review have been conducted for quantitative evaluation. In the present study, a numerical model has been presented by adopting Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Fuzzy theory. The index evaluation system is established considering the characteristics of the navigation channels in the research domain. The weight of each index is then determined. The judgment matrix is finally combined with the data analysis of the expert questionnaire to achieve quantitative evaluation of the AtoN efficacy. The results indicate that the efficacy of AtoN is overall favorable (with a mean value of 8.0 out of 10) under current arrangement. The proposed quantitative evaluation method could provide a guidance for maritime safety administration.","analytic hierarchy process,maritime AtoN,Transportation,fuzzy AHP approach,Safety,Marine vehicles,port waters,Aids to Navigation Efficacy,Maintenance engineering,efficacy evaluation,maritime safety administration,quantitative evaluation,numerical model,Analytic hierarchy process,quantitative evaluation method,data analysis,marine safety,navigation aids,literature review,maritime aids to navigation,fuzzy comprehensive evaluation,river,fuzzy set theory,AtoN efficacy,fuzzy theory,Indexes,water transport,navigation channels,AHP,Navigation,qualitative description methods,index evaluation system,"
"b-cell depletion immunotherapy in pemphigus: effects on cellular and humoral immune responses","2008","Pemphigus are B-cell-mediated autoimmune diseases affecting skin and mucous membranes. They are characterized by the production of pathogenic autoantibodies directed against desmogleins (Dsg). In this prospective study, we treated 21 pemphigus patients with rituximab and analyzed immunological modifications induced by anti-CD20 immunotherapy. The total depletion of peripheral B cells led to a significant decrease of total serum IgM but not IgG levels. The B-cell depletion was followed by a progressive re-emergence of naive blood B lymphocytes, with one-third of them expressing a transitional CD19+CD38highCD24high phenotype. In most patients, clinical response to rituximab was closely related to the evolution of anti-Dsg autoantibodies that decreased in patients who achieved complete remission, whereas they remained unchanged or reincreased in relapsing patients. In contrast, serum antimicrobial IgG remained stable after rituximab treatment. B-cell repertoire analysis of three patients using immunoscope showed distortions of VH-IgM and VH-IgG immunoscope profiles before treatment, particularly clonal and oligoclonal expansions in some VH families, which were not found after B-cell reconstitution, following anti-CD20 immunotherapy. The depletion of autoreactive B cells leading to the elimination of anti-Dsg autoantibodies in most remitted patients and the restoration of a diverse B-cell repertoire by naive B lymphocytes may provide an explanation for the long-lasting efficacy of rituximab in pemphigus patients.

"maritime field trial of a dual-band silicon integrated photonics-based radar","2022","This paper reports the development, the complete characterization, and the first outdoor field trial of a coherent dual-band photonics-based radar implemented through integrated photonic circuits. The dual band radar transceiver has been implemented on a silicon-on-insulator platform, and is capable of operating up to the Ku-band. It has been packaged and engineered on a printed circuit board for its use in a complete radar system. The electronic RF front-end in S- and X-bands and the digital baseband equipment have been developed in order to guarantee performance aligned with the state of the art of conventional radars. The developed apparatus has been characterized in S- and X-band in terms of sensitivity, linearity, phase noise, and conversion efficiency, both at chip and system level. The impact and issues related to the used fabrication platform and to the packaged approach have been analyzed. The outdoor field trial has been carried out in a relevant maritime environment close to the port of Livorno (Italy). First, X-band radar acquisitions of a complex maritime scene using a rotating antenna has allowed to verify the radar behavior by comparing the detected scene with official data provided by the automatic identification system mounted on the observed ships. A false alarm probability of 2Ã—10âˆ’5 has been demonstrated, aligned with radar state of the art. Then, S- and X-band range/velocity acquisitions allowed to confirm the coherent dual band operation, posing the basis for the next step: the development of adapted coherent data fusion algorithms for target imaging.","silicon,silicon-on-insulator platform,outdoor field trial,sensor fusion,dual-band silicon integrated photonics-based radar,Ku-band,radar system,dual-band photonics-based radar,radar detection,radio transceivers,radar antennas,dual band radar transceiver,CW radar,Laser radar,integrated optics,Radio frequency,complex maritime scene,maritime field trial,silicon photonics,ships,Integrated optics,Optical modulation,system level,radar,object detection,search radar,printed circuits,relevant maritime environment,Radar,radar signal processing,complete radar system,conventional radars,X-bands,radar behavior,chip,X-band radar acquisitions,integrated photonic circuits,coherent dual band operation,probability,Photonic integration,Photonics,dual band operation,developed apparatus,printed circuit board,Spaceborne radar,transceivers,FM radar,radar state,"

The study focuses on the adjustment of a clustering technique to trajectory data, specifically using a DBSCAN algorithm that is adapted by means of two approaches. On the one hand, the DTW trajectory similarity metric is used to obtain a distance between two trajectories. On the other hand, an extraction of features of interest from each trajectory allowing a summary of the trajectory in a single multidimensional instance.

"development of an interpretable maritime accident prediction system using machine learning techniques","2022","Every year, maritime accidents cause severe damages not only to humans but also to maritime instruments like vessels. The authors of this work therefore propose a machine learning-based maritime accident prediction system that can be used to prevent maritime accidents from happening by predicting and interpreting the accidents. This work overcomes the limitations of the existing works that lack practicability in the sense that the ex-post analyses are conducted to suggest accident prevention strategies but maritime accidents are not analyzed holistically. Using extensive literature reviews and expert interviews, a large number of risk factors associated with maritime accidents are identified, and related data are collected and utilized in the work. Throughout variable selection, data retrieval, hot-spot identification, and the maritime accident prediction model construction process, various machine learning algorithms are exploited in order to construct an organized system. In addition, interpretations for the resulting accident predictions are given using interpretable machine learning algorithms so as to provide explainable results to users. Finally, the proposed system is evaluated using a SERVQUAL model and proves its effectiveness in real-world applications.","Human factors,Predictive models,Risk management,Safety,accident prediction,Bayes methods,ocean engineering,Accidents,Machine learning,interpretable machine learning,Maritime accident,"
"the assessment of air and soil as contributors of some trace metals to vegetable plants i. use of a filtered air growth cabinet","1989","The sources of heavy metals in a number of consumer crops were investigated in the laboratory by growing plants in a dual growth cabinet supplied with both clean and ambient air. Under these conditions, plants were exposed separately to filtered and normal ambient air to assess the influences of soil and atmosphere on the accumulation of Cd, Pb, Zn, Cr and Ni. Radish, carrot, pea, spinach and lettuce plants were successfully grown in the cabinet. Analysis of the metals in the plant tissues showed that the foliar route is potentially of similar importance to the soil-root pathway as a route of transport to the exposed parts of the plants. Whilst the exposed parts showed the highest metal accumulation from the air, the levels of metals in fruits and storage roots resulting from foliar translocation of the airborne component appeared to be low generally. The metal which achieved highest translocation from foliar deposition was Pb. The effect of spraying plants with rain-water was to enhance slightly the total content of all trace metals analysed.",""
"effects of persistence and large-scale climate anomalies on trends and change points in extreme precipitation of canada","2017","Slowly varying (trend) and abrupt (change points) changes in annual maximum daily precipitation (AMP) and seasonal maximum daily precipitation (SMP) across Canada for 223 stations in six regions during four periods (1900–2010, 1930–2010, 1950–2010 and 1970–2010) were analyzed. Variants of the Mann-Kendall (MK) test considering influences of short-term persistence (STP), long-term persistence (LTP) and large-scale climate anomalies on trend detection were applied to detect trends, and the Pettitt test was used to evaluate change points. The results indicate that there was a mix of increasing and decreasing trends for Canadian AMPs and SMPs. Most regions in Pacific Maritime, central Boreal regions and the Atlantic Maritime showed an increase in AMP, while a decrease in Canadian Prairies and most Boreal regions. More stations showing statistically significant increases than decreases in spring, summer and autumn SMPs were found while there was a statistically significant decrease (increase) in winter SMP over southern (northern) Canada. LTP significantly increased the likelihood of trends detected in AMPs and SMPs. The effects of STP on the trend detection were also evident as shown by the differences in results obtained from the MK tests with and without considering the effect of STP. The effects of large-scale climate anomalies on trends were significant for winter SMPs. More than 1/4 of stations were detected with statistically significant change points in AMPs and SMPs which occurred around 1960–1990. More stations showed significant change points than trends, and winter showed more evident trends and change points in SMPs than other three seasons.

"seaweed and climate change: a mapping review","2023","Seaweed has garnered increasing interest due to its capacity to mitigate climate change by curbing carbon emissions from agriculture, as well as its potential to serve as a supplement or alternative for dietary, livestock feed, or fuel source production. Moreover, seaweed is regarded as one of the earliest plant forms to have evolved on Earth. Owing to the extensive body of literature available and the uncertainty surrounding the future trajectory of seaweed research under evolving climate conditions, this review scrutinizes the structure, dynamics, and progression of the literature pertaining to seaweed and climate change. This analysis is grounded in the Web of Science Core Collection database, augmented by CiteSpace software. Furthermore, we discuss the productivity and influence of individual researchers, research organizations, countries, and scientific journals. To date, there have been 8047 articles published globally (after a series of filters and exclusions), with a notable upswing in publication frequency since 2018. The USA, China, and Australia are among the leading countries contributing to this research area. Our findings reveal that current research on seaweed and climate change encompasses 13 distinct research clusters, including “marine heatwave”, “temperate estuary”, “ocean acidification”, and “macroalgal bloom”. The most frequently cited keywords are “climate change”, “biomass”, “community”, and “photosynthesis”. The seaweed species most commonly referenced in relation to climate change include Gracilaria sp., Sargassum sp., Ecklonia maxima, and Macrocystis pyrifera. These results provide valuable guidance for shaping the direction of specialized topics concerning marine biodiversity under shifting climate conditions. We propose that seaweed production may be compromised during prolonged episodes of reduced water availability, emphasizing the need to formulate strategies to guarantee its continued viability. This article offers fresh perspectives on the analysis of seaweed research in the context of impending climate change.","Photosynthesis,Phytoplankton,Eutrophication,"

China's unique wealth of written history provides an abundance of proxy data on the climatic record and that record now furnishes a basis for analysing both long-term and short-term fluctuations, as well as sunspot behavior, that together provide an insight into extraterrestrial forcing. Recent Chinese work suggests a solar forcing, but our own studies suggest rather that a lunar tidal component, reinforced at times by the solar element may prove more important.

"failure analysis of a gas transport pipe made of api 5l x60 steel","2022","Pipelines used in the oil and gas transport usually contain some sulfur dioxide, which absorbs hydrogen from the pipe wall and accelerates hydrogen damage of steels. Also, the welding process and the type of manufacturing process can facilitate the entry of hydrogen into the steel. In this research, API 5L X60 pipes used in the refinery of Tang-e-Bijar region of Kermanshah, Iran, were studied. Microstructural studies showed that the primary microstructure of the steel consisted of 55% ferrite and 45% pearlite. The microstructure in the welding zone could include Widmanstatten ferrite, based on its morphology shown in the optical etched microstructure. The observed cracks in the microstructure were also of step-wise cracking and represent the possibility of hydrogen induced cracking. Pre-etching observations using light microscopy shows MnS impurities in the structure. Also, SEM/EDS analysis revealed that the cracks were formed from the accumulation of MnS impurities and these impurities were preferred sites for nucleation and growth of the cracks. The results of the mechanical testing including hardness, impact and tensile test showed that the steel had a ductile behavior for all the sections and no hydrogen embrittlement has been probable.","Microstructure study,Mechanical properties,API 5L X60 steel,Failure analysis,"
"imitating radar operator decisions for maritime surveillance missions using bayesian networks","2019","This paper presents the use of Bayesian networks for learning decisions made by a human radar operator carrying out a maritime surveillance mission. By imitating the operator's decisions, a significant increase in the autonomy of a radar surveillance system can be achieved as well as potentially streamlining the qualification process. For maritime scenarios, current literature has only focused on using a Bayesian network (BN) for identification and assessment, and often assumes inputs from a generic surveillance sensor. Furthermore, in both the maritime surveillance and radar operations domain, there has been no investigation into using the operator's data in order to learn the decisions made throughout the mission. This paper uses a realtime radar simulation in order to obtain the scenario and radar information that would be observed by a human operator. In conjunction with a user interface, the simulation is further used to obtain operator decisions for a given mission with the maximum likelihood approach used to obtain the BN probabilities. The BN is then used in place of the operator for interfacing with the simulation in order to test the suitability of this method. Several typical scenarios are used to demonstrate the BN's operational ability relative to that of the operator. Additionally, the required data size for sufficient performance is investigated.","radar surveillance system,surveillance,Bayes methods,radar operations domain,belief networks,Bayesian networks,human radar operator,realtime radar simulation,maritime scenarios,radar operator decisions,target tracking,learning decisions,radar computing,machine learning,radar information,Graphical user interfaces,generic surveillance sensor,Radar tracking,Artificial intelligence,maritime surveillance mission,radar tracking,Airborne radar,probability,Bayesian network,Surveillance,Task analysis,imitation learning,learning (artificial intelligence),"
"towards a convolutional neural network model for classifying regional ship collision risk levels for waterway risk analysis","2020","Estimating the navigational risk of vessels operating in sea and waterway areas is important for waterway risk management and pollution preparedness and response planning. Existing methods relying on a model-informed expert judgment of ship-ship collision risk are of limited practical use because periodic risk monitoring is feasible only when this can be done without extensive use of organizational resources. To alleviate such limitations, this article presents a new approach based Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and image recognition to interpret and classify ship-ship collision risks in encounter scenarios. The specific aim of the article is to investigate whether a CNN-based model can quickly and accurately interpret images constructed based on data from the Automatic Identification System (AIS) in terms of collision risk. To test this, estimates derived from training data are compared to validation data. It is also investigated whether adding additional navigational information based on AIS data improves the model's predictive accuracy. A case study with data from the Baltic Sea area is implemented, where various model design alternatives are tested as a proof-of-concept. The main finding of this work is that a CNN-based approach can indeed meet the specified design requirements, suggesting that this is a fruitful direction for future work. Several issues requiring further research and developed are discussed, with the validity of the risk ratings underlying the image classification seen as the most significant conceptual challenge before a CNN-model can be put to practical use.","Image recognition,Maritime Safety,Convolutional Neural Network,Ship-ship collision,AIS data,Machine learning,"
"ensuring the survivability of embedded computer networks based on early detection of cyber attacks by integrating fractal analysis and statistical methods","2022","The paper discusses a method for ensuring the survivability of embedded computer networks in conditions of cyber attacks, based on identifying anomalies in network traffic by assessing its self-similarity and determining the type of impact of cyber attacks using statistical methods. The proposed method includes three stages, at which the analysis of the self-similarity property for the reference traffic is performed (using the Dickey-Fuller test, R/S analysis and the DFA method), the analysis of the self-similarity property for real traffic (by the same methods) and additional processing of time series with statistical methods (moving average, Z-Score and CUSUM methods). The issues of software implementation of the proposed method and the formation of a data set containing network packets are considered. The experimental results demonstrated the presence of self-similarity in network traffic and confirmed the high efficiency of the proposed method. The method allows detecting cyber attacks in real or near real time and ensures high survivability of the embedded computer network.","Time Series,Machine Learning,Embedded Computer Network,Fractal Analysis,Survivability,Hurst exponent,Cyber attack,"
"subsea pipelines incidents prevention: a case study in brazil","2023","There are more than 4000 subsea pipelines in Brazil. These pipes include umbilicals, drilling risers, flexible risers, rigid risers, hybrid risers, flowlines, and export pipelines. Despite all standards, regulations, guides, and risk management tools designed to avoid events, subsea pipeline incidents still occur, revealing possible failures in companies' risk control. Identifying similarities between different subsea pipeline failure events is crucial to improving the design, risk management practices, and regulation requirements, besides promoting accident prevention. This paper proposes applying the life cycle and management practices combined to analyze subsea pipeline incidents from the RDI (Detailed Incident Report) and investigations reported to ANP (Brazilian National Agency of Petroleum, Gas, and Biofuels), the Brazilian safety regulatory agency. Furthermore, subsea pipeline incidents data were analyzed: correlated circumstances, consequences, and causes. The results show that most riser and flowlines causal factors are related to equipment failures, and recurrent root causes are design errors and integrity control. Based on the proposed approach, it was possible to identify gaps in most riser and flowlines accident investigations since there are few causal factors, root causes, and the absence of riser and flowlines failure mode and mechanisms. Therefore, the development of accident recommendations can be compromised. Thus, this paper proposes improvements to current Brazilian regulations to clarify the minimal subsea pipeline accident investigation requirements.","Accidents analysis,Regulation,Oil and gas pipelines,Safety,"
"surface ozone trends over a 21-year period at el arenosillo observatory (southwestern europe)","2022","The near-surface ozone measured at El Arenosillo observatory (in Southwestern Europe) over 21 years (2000−2020) was analyzed to explore its trends. Using monthly averages and their anomalies, we obtained trends of 0.9 ± 0.7 ppb decade−1 (p = 0.211) and 1.2 ± 0.4 ppb decade−1 (p = 0.001), respectively. Daytime and nighttime trends were 0.6 ± 0.5 ppb decade−1 (p = 0.198) and 1.4 ± 0.4 ppb decade−1 (p < 0.001), respectively. The seasonal trends showed upward values for winter, spring and autumn between 1.6 and 1.8 ppb decade−1, with downward values for summer. The surface temperature and geopotential height at the 500 hPa level (Z500) showed upward trends, which were higher in winter and autumn, while NOx and VOC emissions presented downward trends. The surface ozone trend could be attributed mostly to the cold months and occurred mainly in the nocturnal period. The higher temperatures and anticyclonic conditions, i.e., a warmer climate, along with the reduction of the precursor emissions, could be leading to less destruction by NO titration in cold seasons and nighttime, whereas the reduction of VOC would not favor the ozone formation and accumulation processes in warm seasons and diurnal time. In the near future, new studies will be necessary to explore other processes involved in this upward ozone trend.","NO and VOCs emissions,Long-term trends,Surface ozone,Ozone precursors,"
"a safety barrier-based accident model for offshore drilling blowouts","2013","Blowout is one of the most serious accidents in the offshore oil and gas industry. Accident records show that most of the offshore blowouts have occurred in the drilling phase. Efficient measures to prevent, mitigate, and control offshore drilling blowouts are important for the entire offshore oil and gas industry. This article proposes a new barrier-based accident model for drilling blowouts. The model is based on the three-level well control theory, and primary and secondary well control barriers and an extra well monitoring barrier are established between the reservoir and the blowout event. The three barriers are illustrated in a graphical model that is similar to the well-known Swiss cheese model. Five additional barriers are established to mitigate and control the blowout accident, and event tree analysis is used to analyze the possible consequence chains. Based on statistical data and literature reviews, failures of each barrier are presented. These failures can be used as guidance for offshore drilling operators to become aware of the vulnerabilities of the safety barrier system, and to assess the risk related to these barriers. The Macondo accident is used as a case study to show how the new model can be used to understand the development of the events leading to the accident. The model can also be used as an aid to prevent future blowouts or to stop the escalation of events.","Accident model,Offshore drilling,Active failures,Safety barrier,Blowout,"
"design of a wireless power transfer system with two inputs with large voltage differences for missiles mounted on maritime vessels","2022","Missiles mounted on maritime vessels have two types of loads. One is the operating load consumed just before launch, and the other is the safety sensors load that must always be activated for safety. Because the operating load consumes a large power capacity, the power generated by the vesselâ€™s own power generators must be supplied. Meanwhile, the loads for safety sensors are supplied through an energy storage system (ESS) because the safety sensors must be supplied with power even when the generators stop. However, the voltage difference between the generated power and the ESS power reaches ten times or more. Therefore, there is a problem in that the input of the two power sources with a large input difference must be transferred to two loads through only a pair of coils. To solve this problem, a WPT system is proposed to overcome the voltage difference between the generated power and the ESS power. The design method of the proposed system is analyzed mathematically, and it is verified through simulations and experiments. The proposed system has a maximum dc to dc power transfer efficiency of 76.8% with a capacity of 550 W and has the advantage that power is continuously supplied to the sensor loads even if the input voltage source is changed. In addition, by operating the proposed WPT system under a wide load range of 200 W to 1000 W, the effectiveness of the proposed WPT system is proved.","WPT system,maritime vessel,power 200.0 W to 1000.0 W,Safety,power generators stop,Sensor systems,coils,electrical safety,missile,Reliability,energy storage,missiles,input voltage source,Coils,power capacity,Voltage,ESS power,energy storage system,power supply,marine power systems,safety sensors load,wireless power transfer system,maratime vessel missile system,power 550.0 W,dc power transfer efficiency,Sensors,inductive power transmission,Wireless power transfer system,Missiles,"
"deep learning applied to road accident detection with transfer learning and synthetic images","2022","Artificial Intelligence (AI) has driven solutions in diverse areas; one of the most prominent fields is Computer Vision (CV). Accordingly, solutions to effectively detect road accidents can be a game-changer for road safety. The focus is on Vision Zero, i.e., eliminate all traffic fatalities and severe injuries. However, when an accident occurs, response time is essential. Several countries have surveillance cameras monitoring the road network. However, real-time monitoring requires a considerable number of people with training and attention. Our solution automates this with AI, using deep learning to train a model to detect potential accidents. The CV method based on binary image classification was used, being images without accidents classified as normal and images with accidents as alarm. The biggest challenge in developing the model was obtaining images of accidents from the analyzed cameras. The solution adopted was to create synthetic images of these rare events. Several architectures of Convolutional Neural Networks were tested, and it was found that the best approach was to use transfer learning. As base models for transfer learning, the best results were EfficientNetB1 and MobileNetV2. The former for its quality in prediction and the latter for its size and execution speed. As a case study, open data images from Finnish road surveillance cameras were used, provided every ten minutes. Finally, it was found that the solution trained with EfficientNetB1 as the base model has a Mean Average Precision (mAP) of 0.89 and a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.77. The solution based on MobileNetV2 has an mAP of 0.88 and an MCC of 0.71.","Road Accidents,Computer Vision,Deep Learning,Image Classification,Transfer Learning,Synthetic Data,"
"combining multiple correspondence analysis with factorial kriging analysis for geochemical mapping of the gold–silver deposit at marrancos (portugal)","2004","This study concerns the application of multiple correspondence analysis and factorial kriging analysis to soil data, and aims to identify spatial patterns and superficial soil anomalies of the Au and Ag deposit at Marrancos, Vila Verde. The mineral deposit can be described as a quartz auriferous shear-zone, consisting of a quartz breccia of tectonic origin hosted by metamorphic rocks (hornfels). Gold is associated with arsenopyrite and pyrite, and Ag with galena and galenobismuthite. A total of 286 soil samples were analysed for Fe, Cu, Zn, Pb, Co, Ni, Mn, Ag and Bi by atomic absorption spectrometry, As, Se, Te and Sb by atomic absorption spectrometry–hydride generation system and Au by inductively coupled plasma–atomic emission spectroscopy after extraction of the metal by an organic solvent (methyl-isobutylketone). The methodology used included (a) multiple correspondence analysis applied to soil data to obtain some factors that summarize geochemical information, (b) a structural analysis (variography) in order to account for spatial variability of these factors, and (c) factorial kriging analysis used to split these factors into their spatial components. This methodology allowed an efficient multi-element characterization of the spatial patterns as well as the identification and interpretation of significant anomalies, not always associated to Au-bearing geological structures.",""
"parsec, an application of probabilistic case based reasoning to maritime surveillance","2009","This paper describes the theoretical basis and practical implementation of PARSEC, a knowledge-based system that uses probabilistic case based reasoning. PARSEC is a major component in the PANDA surveillance system, developed under DARPA leadership to support maritime situation awareness monitoring on a global scale. PANDA detects unusual vessel motions (deviations) based on learned normalcy models and then flags those particular deviations that an analyst is likely to describe as remarkable or suspicious, given the available context for the deviation. The context data include information on weather and sea-state, notices to mariners, piracy events, vessel ownership changes, commodity prices, and other information.

"an analysis of high fine aerosol loading episodes in north-central spain in the summer 2013 - impact of canadian biomass burning episode and local emissions","2018","This work presents an evaluation of a surprising and unusual high turbidity summer period in 2013 recorded in the north-central Iberian Peninsula (IP). The study is made up of three main pollution episodes characterized by very high aerosol optical depth (AOD) values with the presence of fine aerosol particles: the strongest long-range transport Canadian Biomass Burning (BB) event recorded, one of the longest-lasting European Anthropogenic (A) episodes and an extremely strong regional BB. The Canadian BB episode was unusually strong with maximum values of AOD(440 nm) ∼ 0.8, giving rise to the highest value recorded by photometer data in the IP with a clearly established Canadian origin. The anthropogenic pollution episode originated in Europe is mainly a consequence of the strong impact of Canadian BB events over north-central Europe. As regards the local episode, a forest fire in the nature reserve near the Duero River (north-central IP) impacted on the population over 200 km away from its source. These three episodes exhibited fingerprints in different aerosol columnar properties retrieved by sun-photometers of the AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) as well as in particle mass surface concentrations, PMx, measured by the European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme (EMEP). Main statistics, time series and scatterplots relate aerosol loads (aerosol optical depth, AOD and particulate matter, PM) with aerosol size quantities (Ångström Exponent and PM ratio). More detailed microphysical/optical properties retrieved by AERONET inversion products are analysed in depth to describe these events: contribution of fine and coarse particles to AOD and its ratio (the fine mode fraction), volume particle size distribution, fine volume fraction, effective radius, sphericity fraction, single scattering albedo and absorption optical depth. Due to its relevance in climate studies, the aerosol radiative effect has been quantified for the top and bottom of the atmosphere, obtaining mean daily values for this extraordinary summer period of −14.5 and −47.5 Wm−2, respectively.","Fine aerosol particles,Aerosol radiative effect,Aerosol microphysical properties,Aerosol optical properties,Biomass burning,Anthropogenic pollution,"
"anomaly detection in maritime domain based on spatio-temporal analysis of ais data using graph neural networks","2021","One of the critical applications of trajectory mining is Event Detection, where an automatized task identifies the deviation of a vesselâ€™s movement from its standard route. Conventionally, Origin-Destination matrix data is utilized for event detection which has limitations such as removal of temporal aspect of data and inability to access to trajectory features such as speed of vessel from origin to destination. To utilize aforementioned features available in Automatic information system (AIS), we formulate the problem in a novel way, by detecting anomalies in a set of directed graphs representing the movement pattern at each time interval. We further propose Graph Network Deviation Detector (GNDD), which leverages graph embedding and context embedding techniques to capture anomalies in the spatio-temporal patterns of movement. Extensive experiments applied on five real-world AIS datasets show that our method achieved promising results in identifying abnormal movements.","Graph neural networks,critical applications,data mining,graph embedding,event detection,Automatic information system,Anomaly detection,matrix algebra,Graph Network Deviation Detector,abnormal movements,Origin-Destination matrix data,Feature extraction,movement pattern,neural nets,Directed graphs,temporal aspect,marine systems,automatized task,Signal processing,maritime domain,directed graphs,Artificial intelligence,trajectory mining,standard route,graph theory,anomaly Detection,Spatiotemporal graph embeddings,real-world AIS datasets,spatio-temporal analysis,Trajectory,trajectory features,aforementioned features,Event detection,AIS data,"

"influence of climate cycles on grapevine domestication and ancient migrations in eurasia","2018","The objective of this work is to investigate the Holocenic climate cycles that may have influenced the domestication of grapevine in the Subcaucasian area and its subsequent spread in Eurasia. The analysis covered the longitudinal belt ranging from the Iberian Peninsula to Japan, seen as the preferential pathway for the Holocenic spread of grapevine and many other crops in Eurasia. Spectral analysis was considered as the criterion of investigation and the Holocenic cycles were analyzed considering different geochemical and biological proxies, of which seven are directly referred to vine. In this context the relation of the abovementioned proxies with spectral peaks of possible causal factors like Solar activity (SA), North Atlantic oceanic factors (Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation - AMO and North Atlantic Oscillation - NAO), and subtropical oceanic factors (El Nino Southern Oscillation - ENSO) was also analyzed. In order to acquire a sufficiently wide number of proxies sensitive to the causal factors, we referred to a latitudinal belt wider than the one colonized by vine, also acquiring proxy from the Scandinavian area, notoriously susceptible to North Atlantic forcings. The analysis of the proxy spectral peaks, considering 20 classes with a 50-years step in the 0–1000 years range, showed that the 50% of the classes have a higher frequency of peaks at East than West, the 20% a higher frequency at West than East and the 10% an equal frequency, showing the efficiency of the propagation of Western signals towards the center of Eurasia. The search of the causal factors spectral peaks in the proxy series showed that AMO, NAO and SA acted with a certain regularity on the entire belt investigated both latitudinally and longitudinally, while spectral peaks linked to ENSO underwent a considerable attenuation moving northward. Finally, the specific analysis on viticultural proxies showed common peaks with causal factors.","Viticulture,Paleoclimate,Eurasia,Holocene,Spectral analysis,"
"aerosol characteristics and types in the marine environments surrounding the east mediterranean - middle east (emme) region during the aqaba campaign","2023","This study analyzes the aerosol optical properties (scattering, absorption coefficients, single scattering albedo), supported by chemical composition measurements, in the marine boundary layer of the East Mediterranean – Middle East (EMME) region, aiming to explore the spatio-temporal variability, aerosol mixing state, sources and dominant types. The measurements were taken during the AQABA (Air Quality and climate change in the Arabian Basin) cruise campaign (1st July – September 1, 2017) from the south of France to Kuwait and back. Both scattering and absorption coefficients for PM1 and PM10 particles maximized in the southern Red Sea, due to continental outflow from East Africa, and in the Arabian/Persian Gulf due to enhanced anthropogenic/industrial emissions, leading to 3-fold sulfate concentrations compared to the other regions. The East Mediterranean exhibited moderate aerosol loading, with high scattering Ångström Exponent (SAE) values (1.98, 1.30 for PM1 and PM10, respectively), which increased in the Suez Canal and the Arabian Gulf due to impact from combustion sources. The aerosol over the Gulf of Aden and the West Arabian Sea was dominated by coarse particles (SAE<1), with higher Ca2+ concentrations (dust influence). The absorption Ångström Exponent (AAE) remained close to 1, indicative of black carbon (BC) from fossil fuel combustion, while it increased in regions dominated by dust (Gulf of Aden, Arabian Sea). Contrasting aerosol types were identified between the sub-regions using the SAE vs. AAE classification scheme. The “BC-dominated” type prevailed over the East Mediterranean and Suez Canal, while dust mixtures dominated in the Gulf of Aden and the Arabian Sea. Over the Arabian Gulf, mixing of anthropogenic pollution with marine aerosols formed a type with fine particles and low spectral dependence of absorption (AAE<1). Spectral SSA significantly varied along the ship cruise, while it was used for determination of dust influence in the marine environment.","Marine boundary layer,Mediterranean,Aerosol scattering,Absorption,Aerosol types,Middle East,"
"hkpm: a hierarchical key-area perception model for hfswr maritime surveillance","2022","High-frequency surface wave radar (HFSWR) has become the cornerstone of maritime surveillance because of its low-cost maintenance and coverage of wide area. However, when it comes to the extraction of key areas, such as vessel-target detection and vessel-path tracking, the HFSWR signal is strongly interfered by clutters and noise, which makes maritime surveillance a challenging task. This article proposes a hierarchical key-area perception model for maritime surveillance harnessing range-Doppler (RD) image from HFSWR, Laplacian kernel, a linear classifier (LC), and a subnet-based multilayer representation learning framework (SMRLF). First, a weak LC with a Laplacian kernel is utilized to capture the plausible vessel regions (PVRs). Then, a novel SMRLF is proposed to localize the vessel targets from the PVRs. To handle the noise, a maximum correntropy criterion with variable centers (MCC-VC) is incorporated in the subnet-based learning model. A thorough experimental analysis on cross-domain samples from radar dataset to scene classification dataset shows that the proposed HKPM performs competitively. The model shows a superior performance over most of the state-of-the-art vessel-target detection algorithms with a vessel-target detection accuracy of 94%. The extended analysis on image classification problem proves that the proposed model has great adaptivity and scalability.","vessel-target detection accuracy,HKPM,Kernel,marine radar,subnet-based multilayer representation learning framework,Discrete wavelet transforms,radar clutter,plausible vessel regions,Laplacian kernel,range-Doppler (RD) image,vessel-path tracking,maritime surveillance harnessing RD image,hierarchical key-area perception model,image classification problem,radar computing,vessel-target detection algorithms,maximum correntropy criterion with variable centers,linear classifier,maritime surveillance,radar dataset,object detection,feature extraction,image classification,search radar,High-frequency surface wave radar (HFSWR),radar imaging,low-cost maintenance,Radar,SMRLF,maritime surveillance harnessing range-Doppler image,MCC-VC,Doppler radar,scene classification dataset,representation learning,Clutter,Radar imaging,HFSWR signal,Surveillance,Signal processing algorithms,learning (artificial intelligence),HFSWR maritime surveillance,high-frequency surface wave radar,"
"maritime vessel route extraction and automatic information system (ais) spoofing detection","2021","Automated Identification System (AIS) comprises of a global real-time network of maritime vessels, transmitters, and satellite or ground-station receivers, which are used to track and record time-stamped static (vessel-id, type, etc.) and dynamic (location, course, speed, etc.) information of all maritime vessels. Traditionally, this data feed has been used by vessel traffic services to avoid vessel collisions, however increasingly, marine researchers and data scientists have shown interest in developing algorithms on historical AIS data-dumps with diverse objectives such as estimating trends in global ocean-currents, maritime logistical planning, fishing fleet monitoring and enhancing maritime security. This paper aims to propose a novel shipping-route extraction algorithm to process historical AIS data (running into tens of gigabytes of daily data, from more than a hundred thousand maritime vessels), to effectively characterize global shipping route behaviour and capture its seasonal trends. This is done by formulating a sigmoid based turning waypoint identification, which does not solely depend on the change in the course of a vessel, derived from AIS message. The AIS data is further processed to excerpt the vesselâ€™s distance from the nearest port and nearest shore with resolution of about 1 km, which forms a handy metric for the identification of suspicious ports. Several other use cases are also explored, which include detecting various anomalies in individual vessel behaviour such as intentional or unintentional switching off AIS transmission, shipping-lane deviations, spoofing transmission messages. To tackle spoofing anomaly, various spoofing identification methods are discussed. A region-based spoofing identification algorithm is developed to identify spoofing points under multiple categories using a clustering algorithm. All the results are visualized through an open-source map overlay.

"an analysis of maritime communications between a ship at sea and a shore station by a ray-based monte carlo method","2017","In this paper, an analysis of maritime communications between a ship at sea and a shore station using a ray-based Monte Carlo method has been proposed. A sea surface is modeled by the one-side Pierson-Moskowitz spectrum. A Monte Carlo method based on a ray tracing is employed to predict the scattering from the temporally evolving rough sea surface for each time step. The maximum of double reflections is restricted in the ray tracing for a practical purpose. The total received signal is the superposition of the direct propagating field and the scattered field by the sea surface. The statistical numerical result is finally obtained by averaging the results from many realizations. Numerical results for the link performance evaluation obtained by the proposed method are illustrated. The results show that the misalignment of transmitting and receiving antennas due to the rolling ship has relatively less impact on the communication link performance than the multipath fading due to the scattering by the temporally evolving rough sea surface.","direct propagating field,Monte Carlo methods,ray tracing,receiving antennas,scattered field,electromagnetic wave propagation,Marine vehicles,Rough surfaces,Transmitting antennas,Scattering,ships,ransmitting antennas,rough sea surface,one-side Pierson-Moskowitz spectrum,Sea surface,Monte Carlo method,transmitting antennas,statistical numerical result,Receiving antennas,communication link performance,Surface roughness,marine communication,shore station,electromagnetic wave scattering,maritime communications,"

We first make the optimal deployment of tethered aerostats (TAs) with the K-means method. In addition, we study the issue of computation task offloading for vessels, focusing on minimizing the process delay of computation task based on the proposed architecture. Finally, because of the NP-hard properties of the optimization problem, we solve it in two stages and propose an improved water-filling algorithm based on queuing theory.

While AISâ€™s initial purpose was to provide automatic reporting between ships, it is now a primary source of worldwide information of maritime vessels. The navigational data that is transmitted by the vessels over AIS falls under the category of spatio-temporal data, which implies that it includes the dimension of space as well as time. This added dimension of time gives considerable insight into the information that can be ascertained from the data, however, at the expense of added complexity in analysis. Two of the major application areas that are being analysed are Maritime Surveillance and Maritime Spatial Planning.

"mercury concentration and isotopic composition on different atmospheric particles (pm10 and pm2.5) in the subtropical coastal suburb of xiamen bay, southern china","2021","The concentration and isotopic composition of particulate-bound mercury (PBM) on both PM2.5 and PM10 were simultaneously measured (24 months) in a typical subtropical coastal suburb of Xiamen bay (SCXB), southern China. The results showed that most mercury was concentrated in PM2.5 and small particulates enriched heavier isotopes of mercury more than lighter ones. Negative Δ199Hg values and slightly positive Δ200Hg values were observed in both PM2.5 and PM10. PBM input sources were identified with isotopic compositions and meteorological data using the NOAA HYSPLIT model. It revealed that biomass combustion is the main source of particulate mercury in SCXB, and the two other sources are urban anthropogenic emissions and potential marine sources. Seasonal variations in isotopic composition and correlation analysis suggested that PBM in SCXB mainly originate from inland after long-distance transportation in spring and under the influence of oceanic air masses in summer. The Δ199Hg/Δ201Hg ratios in all samples (1.01 ± 0.05, 2SE) indicated that the photoreduction of Hg(II) in the aerosol was the main reaction process of PBM transformation in the atmosphere. Seasonal variations in Δ200Hg values were also found, indicating the possibility of even mass independent fractionation in tracing the mercury sources.","Inhalable particle,Fine particle,Mercury source,Photoreduction,Mercury isotopes,"

"using isotopic tracers to enhance routine watershed monitoring – insights from an intensively managed agricultural catchment","2023","Experimental (research-based) and non-research-based watershed monitoring programs often differ with respect to sampling frequency, monitored variables, and monitoring objectives. Isotopic variables, which are more commonly incorporated in research-based programs, can provide an indication of water sources and the transit time of water in a catchment. These variables may be a valuable complement to traditional water quality monitoring variables and have the potential to support improved hydrologic process-related insights from long term monitoring programs that typically have low resolution sampling. The purpose of this investigation is to explore the utility of incorporating isotopic variables (specifically δ18O, δ2H, and 222Rn) into routine monthly sampling regimes by comparing insights gained from these variables to monitoring only specific conductivity and chloride. A complete annual cycle of monthly groundwater and surface water monitoring data collected from the Upper Parkhill watershed in southwestern Ontario, Canada was used to characterize baseline watershed conditions, evaluate watershed resilience to climate change, and examine contamination vulnerability. Study results provide an improved understanding of appropriate tracer use in agricultural regions with isotopic variables able to provide important insights into the seasonality of hydrologic phenomena, such as the timing of groundwater recharge. A comparison of monitoring variables to present-day hydro-meteorological conditions suggests the importance of a winter dominated hydrologic regime and the potential influence of changes in precipitation on groundwater-surface water interactions. Estimated transit time dynamics indicate the likelihood for rapid contaminant transport through surface and shallow subsurface flow and highlight the possible effects of agricultural tile drainage. The sampling approach and data analysis methods adopted in this study provide the basis for improving routine watershed monitoring programs in agricultural regions.","Watershed monitoring,Agricultural watershed,Mean transit time,Rn,Stable water isotopes,"
"sea fog attenuation analysis of white-led light sources for maritime vlc","2019","Maritime VLC has features of high speed, low cost and anti-EMI. The scattering attenuation of sea fog particles for white-LED light source will directly affect the signal transmission. Due to meteorological effects, much physical detail could be lost in Maritime VLC. Effects of changes in the particle size distributions and influences of different sources cannot easily be taken into account. To address this issue, this paper presents scattering spectrum analysis of sea fog particles and attenuation of maritime VLC channel systematically. Firstly, based on sea fog parameters, the scattering, extinction and phase functions of sea fog particles can be calculated by employing Mie theory. Furthermore, scattering analysis of sea fog particle swarm could be evaluated. Then transmission attenuation of wide spectrum white-LED is analyzed by utilizing revised Gamma distribution. According to the sensitivity of the receiver detector in visible light band, the change of white light transmission spectrum is weighted. At last, combined with the white LED spectrum collected by the experiment, simulations describe that spectrum changes of white LED are obtained after transmission for a certain distance.","visible light band,receiver detector,particle size,particle size distributions,scattering functions,Absorption,sea fog particles,light emitting diodes,Gamma distribution,antiEMI,Mie theory,scattering analysis,scattering attenuation,scatting,optical links,fog sea,meteorological effects,fog,signal transmission,Atmospheric modeling,Scattering,free-space optical communication,Attenuation,scattering spectrum analysis,extinction functions,light attenuation,maritime VLC channel,sea fog particle swarm,Particle swarm optimization,Mie scattering,Atmospheric measurements,sea fog attenuation analysis,electromagnetic interference,underwater optical wireless communication,maritime transmission,light transmission,white LED spectrum,white light transmission spectrum,sea fog parameters,wide spectrum white-LED,transmission attenuation,white-LED light source,phase functions,Light emitting diodes,wide spectrum,"
"electromagnetic characterization of a polluted maritime surface","2018","The objective of this paper is to analyze the effect of the pollutant such as petrol-emulsion on the electromagnetic scattered filed by a maritime surface. Firstly, we investigate the pollutant influence on the maritime surface and physical properties of seawater. Then, we simulate the variation of electromagnetic scattering of the clean maritime surface and also the polluted surface. In this study, the clean and polluted seas are modeled using a semi-empirical spectrum. The simulations of scattering coefficients are realized by using the Forward-Backward Method (FBM), the Composite Two Scale-Model (CTSM) and the Small Slope Approximation (SSA) in monostatic and bistatic configurations.

"has egnos its own place in maritime navigation?","2015","GNSS (in fact it usually means GPS) is at the moment the fundamental means of positioning for any variants of navigation. However some attributes of it can be not sufficient for every users or in some tasks, so there are many cases when this system needs support. From the mariner point of view pure GPS properties perfectly fulfils expectations of sailors at the open sea, however there are lot of cases, when accuracy of the system are not sufficient. Besides of accuracy other performance characteristics, for example availability, risk of jamming etc. are important. As the â€œmedicineâ€ for this, differential version of GPS is suggested. At the moment hundreds of DGPS reference stations exist all over the world, but simultaneously other augmentation systems provide services for example European overlay for GPS (European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service - EGNOS). But over 30 years of DGPS use at sea causes that sailors prefer it than EGNOS.At the moment as EGNOS is fully operational, it is time for evaluation of pro and cons of both services in the maritime context. As it was mentioned, at the open waters there is no doubt about GPS usability and in fact DGPS as well as EGNOS are not necessary. In real situation this is anyway impossible because of limited coverage of DGPS. It is truth that EGNOS is accessible on all the seas around Europe, however seamen do not see so far need of such high accuracy of the fixing. However on restricted waters, on approaches to harbours and on river navigation both systems seem to be indispensable, especially because their accuracy. On the other hand observation made with AIS over accuracy of ships' position on Gdanska Bay suggest that problem is not clear. In these waters two DGPS reference stations are available aside from EGNOS. Observation of AIS messages shows, that on the some leg of the route some ships' positioning data are changeover on DGPS when other one DGPS is switched on GPS, and other one does not change accuracy at all. From the other side positions fixed with DGPS at different locations but at a similar distance from Reference Station have noticeable different accuracy. The location of these places suggests the influence of the signal propagation over land on the fixes accuracy. In the paper analysis of different aspects of both systems work are presented as well as their usefulness and limitations are analysed. Finally the advantage of EGNOS over DGPS in marine navigation and field of application of both systems is discussed.","Satellites,Maritime Navigation,Global Navigation Satellite system,GNSS,European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service,Europe,AIS messages,Receivers,jamming,maritime navigation,European overlay,augmentation systems,Satellite broadcasting,DGPS reference stations,EGNOS,marine navigation,Global Positioning System,"
"a novel autoencoder based feature independent ga optimised xgboost classifier for iomt malware detection","2024","The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) has a network of interconnected medical devices to capture patients' health metrics and store them in a centralized server for analysis by medical experts. The security concerns in IoMT data are therefore very high. The attackers may inject malware into the IoMT data during its transmission. If the health parameters are affected by malware it may mislead the medical experts in making inferences about the patient’s health. IoMT devices are resource-constrained and require faster analysis of data for better medical assistance. Most of the classification techniques used earlier suffer from exhaustive time and resource consumption. Hence, developing an intelligent framework that could reduce the data size and classify the malware quickly is essential. This paper proposes a deep learning framework called Auto-encoder to encode the IoMT data. The encoded features are then given to an XGBoost Classifier whose hyperparameters are optimized using the Genetic Algorithm. XGBoost Classifier detects the presence of malware in the IoMT dataset and Clamp dataset with an accuracy of 98.98% and 98.69% respectively. This lightweight model achieves dimensionality reduction through Autoencoder and effectively detects malware through an optimized XGBoost classifier with faster convergence and limited computational costs. Implementing this framework on the fog layer provides promising results by optimizing resource usage and saving time compared to previous works. Moreover, the proposed method does not need explicit feature selection from the dataset when making predictions.","XGBoost classifier,Genetic algorithm,Auto-encoder,Hyper- parameter tuning,Internet of Medical Things (IoMT),"
"a big data approach for fuel oil consumption estimation in the maritime industry","2022","Route optimization has been a research topic for many years in the maritime industry and it constitutes one of the key components to improving energy efficiency and sustainability in ship operations. This paper deals with the challenge of estimating Fuel Oil Consumption (FOC) in the context of Weather Routing (WR). Given a plethora of features collected from the vesselâ€™s Automatic Identification System (AIS) or on-board sensor installations, we examine how a predictive FOC scheme can be coupled with WR optimization algorithms in order to reduce the vesselâ€™s FOC, emissions, and the overall cost of a voyage. In order to handle the amount of data required for FOC prediction, we employ a streaming pipeline that harvests data in real-time from different sources and processes them appropriately for visualization, causal analysis, and forecasting purposes. In this direction, we first conduct an exploratory analysis to examine and unveil the importance and inter-association between the various variables related to sea-keeping and weather features, in order to utilize them effectively in the context of a FOC predictive scheme. Furthermore, we introduce a novel recurrent neural network architecture that approximates ideally the underlying function describing the features and the vesselâ€™s FOC by taking into account historical data, and we showcase the results. Finally, we demonstrate how the FOC prediction model can be coupled with a WR algorithm to propose the optimal route for a vessel in terms of FOC efficiency.","big data collection,recurrent neural nets,sustainability,recurrent neural network architecture,sea-keeping weather features,Prediction algorithms,fuel oil consumption,WR optimization,Recurrent neural networks,Industries,recurrent neural networks,causal analysis,ship operations,information processing,weather routing,exploratory analysis,vessel data,fuel oil consumption estimation,Oils,ships,automatic identification system,energy efficiency,AIS,optimal route,optimisation,sea-keeping,fuel economy,Big Data,petroleum,on-board sensor installations,Routing,energy consumption,shipbuilding industry,energy conservation,route optimization,maritime industry,weather routing optimization,vessel,production engineering computing,Fuels,FOC prediction,"
"interference range analysis and scheduling among three-hop neighborhood in maritime wimax mesh networks","2010","There is a lack of high-speed and low-cost wireless network at sea to meet the increasing need of maritime users. With this observation, we have envisaged a WiMAX mesh network for high-speed ship-to-ship/shore communications. Analysis of interference range in such maritime WiMAX mesh networks is presented in this paper. And based on the findings, scheduling transmission of MAC control messages and data packets within three-hop neighborhood is investigated for the purpose of minimizing interference. A model is developed for analysis of the interference range in maritime environment. With parameter values that are derived from measurements at sea, we show that by scheduling among three-hop neighborhood the probability a transmission being interfered by a concurrent transmission drops about 30%. Simulation results show that, with the simulation settings in this paper, by scheduling among three-hop neighborhood, the initial packet delay and the average packet delay can be reduced by about 17% and 15.6% in sea state 3.0, respectively. In sea state 6.0, the performance improvement in initial packet delay and average packet delay are about 45% and 19.3%, respectively.","wireless mesh networks,Marine vehicles,Communication system control,Mesh networks,three-hop neighborhood,high-speed ship-to-ship-shore communications,Wireless communication,scheduling,maritime WiMax mesh networks,interference suppression,interference minimization,Delay,access protocols,mobile radio,MAC control messages,radiofrequency interference,Satellite broadcasting,probability,marine communication,Protocols,data packet scheduling transmission,WiMAX,Interference,interference range analysis,WiMax,Analytical models,transmission probability,"
"chapter 3 - risk and vulnerability","2020","Citizens collectively face risks from a range of large-scale hazards. Risk is the interaction of hazard consequences and likelihood. Using this formula, hazards are compared and ranked, allowing disaster managers to determine the most effective and appropriate treatment options. The goal of risk analysis is a standard measurement of likelihood and consequence, whether quantitative or qualitative. Consequence describes hazard effects on humans, built structures, and the environment. Losses may be direct or indirect, and tangible or intangible. Hazard likelihood and consequences can change considerably over time. These trends can be incremental or extreme and can occur suddenly or over centuries. Risk evaluation is conducted to determine the relative seriousness of risks, and to compare and prioritize them. Disaster managers must decide what risks to treat, what risks to prevent at all costs, and what risks to disregard. These decisions are based on risk acceptability. The personal factors that dictate risk acceptability are guided by risk perception. Vulnerability is a measure of the propensity of an object, area, individual, group, community, country, or other entity to incur the consequences of a hazard, and is the result of physical, social, economic, and environmental factors.","Quantitative risk analysis,Qualitative risk analysis,Risk evaluation,Vulnerability,Risk matrix,Tangible and intangible losses,Likelihood,Risk perception,Consequence,Risk,Direct and indirect losses,"
"maritime surveillance with undersampled sar","2017","According to the minimum antenna area constraint, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems require a low-pulse repetition frequency (PRF) to image the wide swaths in ocean surface monitoring scenarios. However, the low PRF that is lower than the Doppler bandwidth will cause azimuth ambiguities. This letter proposes a novel method of mitigating azimuth ambiguities when using an undersampled SAR system for ship detection over the open sea. In this letter, the concept of range subspectra is adopted to misregister the azimuth ambiguity signals. In addition, a change detection method that uses a principal component analysis and k-means clustering is adopted to detect differences in the azimuth ambiguities between two range subspectra images in which the azimuth ambiguities are misregistered. By compensating for the ambiguities in the corresponding image, the ambiguities can be mitigated. This method is only appropriate for bright targets over dark backgrounds in which residual energy loss occurs for useful signals. Both simulated and real data processing results have validated the effectiveness of the proposed method and show that it is feasible for maritime surveillance.","two range subspectra images,ship detection,low-pulse repetition frequency,change detection method,azimuth ambiguity mitigation method,bright targets,Principal component analysis,range subspectrum,Synthetic aperture radar,undersampled,undersampled SAR system,image ambiguities,maritime surveillance,Azimuth ambiguities,real data processing,synthetic aperture radar,ocean surface monitoring scenarios,azimuth ambiguity signals,range subspectra concept,Doppler effect,dark backgrounds,Bandwidth,Azimuth,Doppler bandwidth,residual energy loss,open sea,Imaging,synthetic aperture radar systems,principal component analysis,Barium,minimum antenna area,synthetic aperture radar (SAR),k-mean clustering,oceanographic techniques,"
"dealing with seafood toxins: present approaches and future options","1995","In most maritime countries, the seafood industry is an important source of revenue and accounts for a significant portion of the country's food supply. However, certain seafood, in particular shellfish, may become contaminated with naturally occurring toxins. The existence of shellfish toxins has been known for centuries and early attempts to deal with this threat led to the creation of folklore rituals and religious customs among tribal and ethnic groups. Eventually it was found that these toxins are produced by microbial organisms, usually phytoplankton, that occur naturally in the ocean. In Canada, as well as other countries with cold or temperate coastal waters, three groups of toxins are of particular importance and these are the paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) toxins, the diarrhetic shellfish poisoning (DSP) toxins and amnesic shellfish poisoning (ASP) toxin. Since it is virtually impossible to prevent the occurrence of these toxins, the approach in modern times has been to monitor seafood for the presence or absence of toxins using a standardized mouse bioassay. However, not all toxins can be detected effectively by this method and there is a trend in several countries to dispense with the mouse bioassay. Furthermore, there are differences between countries as to the preferred method of sampling and analysis and there is not agreement between all countries concerning tolerance levels of the various toxins in seafood. These difficulties, the occurrence of new toxins, and the rapid expansion of the shellfish aquaculture industry have put considerable pressure upon the scientific community to develop new methods of coping with these toxins, including more sensitive chemical or biochemical assays that are rapid and inexpensive. The possibilities and options for coping with these ubiquitous toxins are presented and discussed.","monitoring,phytoplankton,detection methods,shellfish,Seafood toxins,"

More data stewards will share their data when they feel secure with the data protection mechanism of the system that will host their data. Critical technologies for data protection and access mediation for CMA are Oracle label security (OLS) and attribute-based access control (ABAC) based on federated identity management.

"a multi-proxy reconstruction of tropical cyclone variability during the past 800 years from robinson lake, nova scotia, canada","2018","This study presents a multi-proxy reconstruction of tropical cyclone (TC) activity for the past 800 years from Robinson Lake, located on the north Atlantic seaboard of Nova Scotia, Canada. Two sediment cores were extracted from Robinson Lake and were dated by 210Pb and 14C methods, and analyzed for organic matter content, sediment grain size, and a range of elements and elemental ratios determined by XRF core scanning. A distinct sand layer in the most recent sediments is attributed to Hurricane Juan, which struck the coast of Nova Scotia on September 29, 2003. Our study shows that peaks in grain size farther down-core are generally correlated with abrupt increases in Br and Br/Ti. XRF-derived Br measurements are an indicator of marine organic carbon (MOC), and the increases in Br likely reflect incursions of marine water and nutrients into the lake as a result of storm surges. The results show that the period from ~1475 to 1670 CE contains at least 3–4 storm beds, and are interpreted as the most active TC period within the last ~800 years for this region. Our results are consistent with recent research from Salt Pond, Massachusetts (Donnelly et al. 2015), which provides evidence for heightened TC activity during the same period as our study at Robinson Lake. Our study represents one of the highest latitude paleotempestological studies from the North Atlantic basin which will help the testing of hypotheses concerning long-term changes in North Atlantic TC activity under future climate change scenarios.","X-ray fluorescence,Grain size analysis,North Atlantic,Tropical cyclones,Paleotempestology,"

"on the theory of intensity distributions of tornadoes and other low pressure systems","2009","Approaching from a theoretical point of view, this work presents a theory which unifies intensity distributions of different low pressure systems, based on an energy of displacement. Resulting from a generalized Boltzmann distribution, the expression of this energy of displacement is obtained by radial integration over the forces which are in balance with the pressure gradient force in the horizontal equation of motion. A scale analysis helps to find out which balance of forces prevail. According to the prevailing balances, the expression of the energy of displacement differs for various depressions. Investigating the system at the moment of maximum intensity, the energy of displacement can be interpreted as the work that has to be done to generate and finally eliminate the pressure anomaly, respectively. By choosing the appropriate balance of forces, number–intensity (energy of displacement) distributions show exponential behavior with the same decay rate β for tornadoes and cyclones, if tropical and extra-tropical cyclones are investigated together. The decay rate is related to a characteristic (universal) scale of the energy of displacement which has approximately the value Eu=β−1≈1000 m2s−2. In consequence, while the different balances of forces cause the scales of velocity, the energy of displacement scale seems to be universal for all low pressure systems. Additionally, if intensity is expressed as lifetime minimum pressure, the number–intensity (pressure) distributions should be power law distributed. Moreover, this work points out that the choice of the physical quantity which represents the intensity is important concerning the behavior of intensity distributions. Various expressions of the intensity like velocity, kinetic energy, energy of displacement and pressure are possible, but lead to different behavior of the distributions.","Intensity distributions,Cyclones,Exponential behavior,Universal scale of energy of displacement,Tornadoes,Power law,"

"impacts of a 4-dimensional variational data assimilation in a coastal ocean model of southern tyrrhenian sea","2016","The impact of the assimilation of satellite sea surface height, sea surface temperature and surface velocity fields observed by a set of high-frequency (HF) radars is studied using a three-dimensional ocean circulation model configured for the southern Tyrrhenian Sea. The study period is October–December 2010 covered by a large number of data. The nonlinear model is based on the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) and the data assimilation component on the four-dimensional variational (4D-Var) algorithm. Assimilation proceeds in a series of 7-day windows, providing an analysis solution in each window. The assimilation of surface velocity combined with other observations has more utility in recovering the density fields based on the theory of geostrophic adjustment and a strong impact both on near-surface horizontal volume fluxes and subsurface flows, constraining surface geostrophic currents in the area not covered by the HF radar data. The adjoint of the 4D-Var gain matrix was used to quantify the impact of individual observations and observation platforms on different aspects of the 4D-Var circulation estimates during both the analysis and subsequent forecast cycles. In this study, we focus on the alongshore transport of the surface and intermediate waters in the eastern zone of southern Tyrrhenian Sea. The majority of the observations available during any given analysis cycle are from HF radar, and on average these data, together with SSH data, exert the largest controlling influence on the analysis increments of coastal transport. Also, observations from satellite platforms in the form of SST have a considerable impact on analyses and forecasts of coastal transport, even though these observations represent a relatively small fraction of the available data at any particular time. During 4D-Var, the observations are used to correct for uncertainties in the model control variables, namely, the initial conditions, surface forcing, and open boundary conditions. It is found that correcting for uncertainties in the initial conditions and only secondarily in the boundary conditions has the largest impact on the analysis increments in alongshore transport. Finally, we note that both the control vector and the observation impact calculations are a useful way for monitoring the performance of the data assimilation system, as well as quantifying the impact of the observations on the circulation estimates.","HF radars,Variational methods,Data assimilation,Ocean modeling,Coastal oceanography,"

"insights from archaeological analysis and interpretation of marine data sets to inform marine cultural heritage management and planning of wave and tidal energy development for orkney waters and the pentland firth, ne scotland","2014","The Orkney archipelago has a rich heritage that includes the Heart of Neolithic Orkney World Heritage Site, Viking settlements, harbours supplying Hudson's Bay Company ships, and the wartime naval base of Scapa Flow. This rich history has left its mark on the seabed but accurate maps showing the location and character of surviving seabed archaeology do not exist to the same extent as for archaeology on land. ORCA Marine was commissioned by Historic Scotland to work with the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland in interrogating marine data sets to enhance historic environment records of Orkney Waters and the Pentland Firth. These waters were prioritised for their history of maritime activity and to help guide planning and developments in an area highlighted by the Scottish Government for marine renewable energy. A variety of recent and legacy datasets, including wreck databases; sonar data gathered by public sector bodies; aerial photography; seabed cores; Admiralty charts; and local knowledge, were examined for their effectiveness in discovering and interpreting marine cultural heritage cost-effectively. A methodology was developed that enabled marine cultural heritage information to be quickly assimilated within the national and regional inventories for dissemination online. Polygonisation of records resulted in GIS-based shapefiles identifying site extents, and areas of archaeological potential in relation to wrecks, submerged prehistoric landscapes, anchorages and fishing areas. Substantial gaps in data coverage were identified and areas of the seabed have been surveyed at resolutions that are sufficient to detect large upstanding remains such as iron shipwrecks but insufficient to identify smaller archaeological features. Other geophysical datasets have been created at a resolution detailed enough to allow the recognition of smaller anomalies but in some cases processing of the data has removed small anomalies of interest to archaeologists. Intensively used marine areas often contain the most artefactual remains such as historic ports being developed to service the marine renewable industry. Zones of high wave and tidal energy favoured for renewable energy devices include navigation channels and hazards where a large number of wrecks are documented. Transmission cable routes cross deep water where 20th-century wartime losses occurred. Planning and development of infrastructure relating to renewables may also interact with significant built heritage and archaeology on the foreshore and coast edge.",""
"advances in subsea carbon dioxide utilization and storage","2023","Decisive steps in innovation and competitiveness are needed to meet global greenhouse gas emissions and climate goals. As an effective method for reducing carbon emissions, carbon dioxide (CO2) storage and utilization on the seabed enable the transport of captured CO2 via pipelines or ships to permanent storage sites, such as saline aquifers or depleted oil and gas reservoirs in subsea sediments, or by injecting CO2 for the replacement and displacement of subsea resources (oil, gas, gas hydrates, etc.). Subsea CO2 utilization and storage (SCUS) involves several research hotspots worldwide, including international and local laws and regulations, security, economics, environmental impact, and public acceptance. Its current research and engineering progress are also of great interest. In addition, the vigorous implementation of the energy transition and the rapid development of renewable energy sources globally have resulted in significant advancements in SCUS. This paper provides an overview of carbon dioxide storage and utilization mechanism in the seabed, analyzes key technical and economic issues, and summarizes existing research on safety risks, monitoring technologies, and investment and operating cost control to identify remaining knowledge gaps. This is followed by an overview of global engineering practice to update on current progress. Finally, combined with the actualities of China, the potential and trend of China's seabed carbon storage and utilization are summarized. This review demonstrates the enormous development prospects for seabed carbon storage and utilization, although some risks remain including leakage and contamination, with which innovation in monitoring technologies and the self-sealing effect of gas hydrate, safe subsea utilization and storage of CO2 can be achieved. Additionally, considering the development of renewable energy and the demand for large-scale energy storage, hydrogen, ammonia, or other energy carriers and carbon dioxide storage and utilization can be coupled into an industrial chain to form an economically competitive carbon geological storage mode.","Technical challenges,CO storage and utilization,Subsea,Economic evaluation,CO hydrate,"
"variable flow controls of closed system pumps for energy savings in maritime power systems","2016","Pumps are extensively used in maritime industries as marine vessels utilize a wide range of pumps and pumping techniques to transfer and distribute all types of air and fluids. The electrical energy consumed by the various motors accounts for about 70% of a vessel's total power consumption, and this presents a problem in unique marine environments. Such situations are especially conducive to energy-saving strategies using variable frequency drives (VFDs) in centrifugal load service. This paper presents the design and results of applying variable frequency constant pressure technology in closed system pumps on marine vessels. The existing problem of traditional control methods for closed system pumps is analyzed and a mathematical model for variable flow controls with the appropriate control settings is derived. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated and verified through experimental and field tests of a practical auxiliary boiler feed water management system on a commercial vessel. It is proved that the proposed method can maintain constant water pressure for closed system pumps and provide an efficient way to measure energy savings and maintenance benefits.

"dem analyses and morphotectonic interpretation: the plio-quaternary evolution of the eastern ligurian alps, italy","2012","The Ligurian Alps (Italy) straddle a complex and ill-defined tectonic transition that accommodates Eurasia–Adria shortening driving concurrent growth of the western Alps and northern Apennines. We focus on the Plio-Quaternary landscape evolution of the eastern part of the Ligurian Alps with the goal of defining the active tectonics through an analysis of topography, drainage networks, and river long profiles. The Ligurian Alps have a steep, seaward-facing escarpment with topographic features reminiscent of the geomorphic markers preserved on both actively-uplifting coastlines and passive margins. For example, there are seaward-facing benches that are thought to be uplifted marine terraces common to active margins; but the drainage divide of the seaward escarpment shows clear evidence of recent northward migration into the Po foreland, a process consistent with escarpment retreat characteristic of passive or subsiding margins. This study explores the active tectonics consistent with these diverse landscape evolution pathways. Our analysis reveals that rock-type strongly throttles the development of topographic relief, drainage networks, and northward migration of the drainage divide. However, we also identify segments of the escarpment that indicate recent base level falls through an analysis of modeled channel steepness and comparison with mean hillslope gradient. The base level falls are consistent with numerous barbed tributaries that are best explained as recent stream captures. No significant correlation among the stream captures at the drainage divide, suspected marine terraces at the coast, Ligurian Sea bathymetry, and active seismicity indicates that the escarpment is the footwall of a segmented normal fault. This normal fault is embedded in a regionally subsiding margin where actively uplifting segments lead to a straightened, pinned drainage divide, whereas, relatively inactive segments permit divide migration into the footwall block. These results are broadly consistent with rock uplift increasing eastward toward Genova across the long-suspected Alps–Apennine Sestri–Voltaggio fault zone. They highlight the respective roles of legacy structures, rock-type, and localized rock uplift in constructing a landscape in an otherwise extending and subsiding crustal retrowedge of an active subduction plate boundary.","Tectonic geomorphology,DEM analysis,Ligurian Alps,River longitudinal profile,"
"boat-induced pressure does not influence breeding site selection of a vulnerable fish species in a highly anthropized coastal area","2022","The brown meagre (Sciaena umbra) is a vulnerable vocal fish species that may be affected by boat noise. The breeding site distribution along the anthropized Venice sea inlets was investigated, by using the species' chorusing activity as a proxy of spawning. Passive acoustic campaigns were repeated at 40 listening points distributed within the three inlets during three-time windows in both summer 2019 and 2020. The role of temporal, morphological, and hydrodynamic variables explaining the observed distribution patterns was evaluated using a GLM approach, considering also human-induced pressures among the candidate predictors. The GLM analysis indicates a higher probability of recording S. umbra chorus after sunset in deeper areas of the inlets, characterized by low water current, while the underwater noise overlapping the species' hearing range and boat abundance did not play any role. This suggests that the species' breeding site choice in the inlets was not influences by boat-induced pressure.","Vessel traffic,Anthropogenic noise,Coastal areas,Passive acoustic monitoring,Bioacoustic,"
"signal strength sensitivity and its effects on routing in maritime wireless networks","2008","Unlike terrestrial networks, the received signal strength in maritime wireless networks are subjected to perturbations due to the sea movement. Surface motions at sea cause variations in antenna heights and orientations of the communicating node (e.g. ships and buoys), thus affecting the received signal strength. In order to minimize such undesirable effects, we carried out a detailed study of the relationship between sea waves and the received signal strength. The effect of antenna gain variations due to tilting of antenna masts were studied by modeling sea waves. The channel path-loss variations were studied using a two-ray path-loss model for the maritime environment. Our analysis showed that the sea wave movements affect both short and longer links. We proposed a simple scheme to avoid the use of unstable links and implemented it on the QualNet network simulator. We carried out IEEE 802.16-based mesh network simulations with sea terrain and path loss models. We observed performance improvements in packet delay and throughput when the stable link selection scheme was used.","receiving antennas,Antennas,radio links,antenna heights variations,antenna masts tilting,channel path-loss variations,Distance measurement,Marine vehicles,QualNet network simulator,IEEE 802.16-based mesh network simulations,unstable links,sea waves,packet delay,maritime wireless networks routing,antenna gain variations,sea terrain,Gain,Receiving antennas,marine communication,signal strength sensitivity,communicating node,two-ray path-loss model,Signal to noise ratio,Interference,received signal strength,WiMax,"

"chapter 8 - emergency and crew survival systems","2023","The safety design of human space systems is primarily focused on preventing a “bad day” by identifying hazards, eliminating them when possible, or otherwise implementing hazard controls to mitigate the risks. However, due to constraints like mass, technology, budget, and schedule, there is a limit to what engineers are required and can achieve. There will always be residual risks. In addition, there could be unidentified hazards and unknown risks that escape even the most rigorous safety analysis process. Since a “bad day” can never be totally engineered away, there is a need to increase the probability of crew survival when things go wrong. While the safety-by-design process aims to lower the probability that a mishap will happen, the crew survival design efforts assume that mishaps will happen and develops emergency systems and contingency procedures that increase the probability of keeping the crew alive. This chapter discusses under the collective term of “emergency and crew survival systems” the implementation of abort, escape, emergency egress, safe haven, emergency medical, and rescue capabilities. The chapter briefly addresses also lunar search and rescue.","Lunar,Emergency,Escape,Post–landing,Rescue,Bad day,Egress,Ingress,"
"pm2.5 extended-range forecast based on mjo and s2s using lightgbm","2023","We developed an extended-range fine particulate matter (PM2.5) prediction model in Shanghai using the light gradient-boosting machine (LightGBM) algorithm based on PM2.5 historical data, meteorological observational data, Subseasonal-to-Seasonal Prediction Project (S2S) forecasts and Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) monitoring data. The analysis and prediction results demonstrated that the MJO improved the predictive skill of the extended-range PM2.5 forecast. The MJO indexes, namely, real-time multivariate MJO series 1 (RMM1) and real-time multivariate MJO series 2 (RMM2), ranked the first, and seventh, respectively, in terms of the predictive contribution of all meteorological predictors. When the MJO was not introduced, the correlation coefficients for the forecasts on lead times of 11–40 days ranged from 0.27 to 0.55, and the root mean square errors (RMSEs) ranged from 23.4 to 31.8 μg/m3. After the MJO was introduced, the correlation coefficients for the 11–40 day forecast ranged from 0.31 to 0.56, among which those for the 16–40 day forecast substantially improved, and the RMSEs ranged from 23.2 to 28.7 μg/m3. When comparing the prediction scores, such as percent correct (PC), critical success index (CSI), and equitable threat score (ETS), the forecast model was more accurate when it introduced the MJO. A novel aspect of this study is to investigate the effects of the MJO mechanism on the meteorological conditions of air pollution in eastern China through advanced regression analysis. The MJO indexes RMM1 and RMM2 considerably impacted the geopotential height field of 28°–40° at 300–250 hPa 45 days in advance. When RMM1 increased and RMM2 decreased 45 days in advance, the 500 hPa geopotential height field weakened accordingly, and the bottom of the 500 hPa trough moved southward; thus cold air was more easily transported southward and the upstream air pollutants were transported to eastern China. With a weak ground pressure field and dry air at low altitudes, the westerly wind component increased, which led to the easier formation of a weather configuration favorable for the accumulation and transport of air pollution, thus resulting in an increase in PM2.5 concentration in the region. These findings can guide forecasters regarding the utility of MJO and S2S for subseasonal air pollution outlooks.","LightGBM,PM,S2S,MJO,Extended-range forecast,"
"detecting dangerous maritime refugee migration paths through cell phone activities","2022","In the 21st century, the world has experienced devastating wars that have caused people to migrate, creating problems in host countries. Among these migration routes, maritime migration routes are more desirable compared to other routes because coasts cannot be controlled as strictly as the alternative passages. However, maritime migration poses life-threatening risks due to unsafe boats, transportation between undesignated areas, lack of life-saving equipment, and dangerous weather conditions chosen for covert operations. Refugees and migrants may die or go missing at sea during these migrations. Most refugees are unaware of high risks they are facing as they hopelessly set out in search of better living conditions. In this study, we propose that such suicide-like maritime migration activities can be detected to some extent through cell phone activities and there may be a way to track early signs of migrants coming together from other regions and migrating through sea routes. By collecting media reports of failed attempts by immigrants and linking them to the D4R cell phone data, we were able to gain some indications of the possibility of early warning systems through analysis of cell phone calls.","Media,D4R,Safety and security of immigrants,Maritime refugee mobility,host countries,Transportation,Safety,migrations,rebar,D4R cell phone data,seismology,refugees,life-threatening risks,Cellular phones,alarm systems,emergency services,cell phone activities,mobile handsets,cell phone calls,dangerous weather conditions,life-saving equipment,mobile computing,dangerous maritime refugee migration paths,sea routes,Alarm systems,Big Data,Boats,earthquake engineering,maritime migration routes,numerical analysis,Early detection of unsafe migration pathways,devastating wars,"
"threat assessment using context-based tracking in a maritime environment","2009","The main objective of this work is to model and exploit available maritime contextual information to provide a hypothesis on suspicious vessel maneuvers. This concept involves utilizing the L1 tracking to perform L2/L3 data fusion, i.e. refinement and assessment for situations and threats. A new context-based tracker known as the ConTracker is developed. The purpose of the ConTracker is to incorporate the contextual information into a traditional alpha - beta tracker in such a way so that it provides a repeller or an attractor characteristics to a specific region of interest. Any behavior of the vessel that is inconsistent with the repeller or the attractor characteristics of the current vessel location would be classified as suspicious. Such an inconsistent vessel behavior would be directly indicated by a high measurement residual which may be used to estimate an accurate process noise covariance using a multiple-model adaptive estimator. Based on the rate of change of the estimated process noise covariance values, an L2/L3 hypothesis generator red-flags the target vessel.

"multispectral imaging contributions to global land ice measurements from space","2005","Global Land Ice Measurements from Space (GLIMS) is an international consortium established to acquire satellite images of the world's glaciers, analyse them for glacier extent and changes, and assess change data for causes and implications for people and the environment. Although GLIMS is making use of multiple remote-sensing systems, ASTER (Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and reflection Radiometer) is optimized for many needed observations, including mapping of glacier boundaries and material facies, and tracking of surface dynamics, such as flow vector fields and supraglacial lake development. Software development by GLIMS is geared toward mapping clean-ice and debris-covered glaciers; terrain classification emphasizing snow, ice, water, and admixtures of ice with rock debris; multitemporal change analysis; visualization of images and derived data; and interpretation and archiving of derived data. A global glacier database has been designed at the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC, Boulder, Colorado); parameters are compatible with and expanded from those of the World Glacier Inventory (WGI). These technology efforts are summarized here, but will be presented in detail elsewhere. Our presentation here pertains to one broad question: How can ASTER and other satellite multispectral data be used to map, monitor, and characterize the state and dynamics of glaciers and to understand their responses to 20th and 21st century climate change? Our sampled results are not yet glaciologically or climatically representative. Our early results, while indicating complexity, are generally consistent with the glaciology community's conclusion that climate change is spurring glacier responses around the world (mainly retreat). Whether individual glaciers are advancing or retreating, the aggregate average of glacier change must be climatic in origin, as nonclimatic variations average out. We have discerned regional spatial patterns in glaciological response behavior; these patterns are best attributed to climate-change variability and to regional differences in glacier size and response times. In many cases, glacier length changes under-represent the magnitude of glacier ablation, because thinning (sometimes without immediate length changes) is also important. An expanded systematic, uniform analysis of many more glaciers is needed to isolate the glacier response components due to climatic and nonclimatic perturbations, to produce quantitative measures of regional variation in glacier changes, and to predict future regional glacier trends relevant to water resources, glaciological hazards, and global sea level. This comprehensive assessment (to be completed in stages) is expected to lend a critically needed filter to identify successful climate models that explain recent glacier changes and change patterns (and hence, are apt to describe future changes) and to eliminate unsuccessful models.","GLIMS,Glacier monitoring,Cryosphere,ASTER,Glacier Land Ice Measurements from Space,"
"hail observations and hailstorm characteristics in europe: a review","2016","Severe thunderstorms associated with large hail are among the most important perils in several European regions. Due to the local-scale extent of hail-affected areas and a lack of appropriate observing systems in most regions, hailstorms are not captured accurately and comprehensively, which makes statistical analysis of their frequency or climatology more difficult. Various studies have been conducted so far to describe and analyze the frequency of hailstorms or related impacts. These studies, however, refer to a wide range of spatial scales and consider different time periods, investigation methods, or hailstone diameters. This article will give a comprehensive overview and review of the present state of knowledge on hail hazard and hail frequency over recent decades up to centuries across Europe and is intended as a reference for future studies. We attempted to summarize and synthesize the various prevailing studies with the objective to identify regions that are most prone to hail hazard. Another focus is put on mechanisms that may explain spatial variability and inhomogeneities in hail frequency observed across various spatial scales.","Hail frequency,Hail,Hail characteristics,Europe,Hail observation,Hailstorm,"
"long-term trends in aerosol optical depth obtained across the globe using multi-satellite measurements","2022","Although trends in the Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) have been examined broadly but the effects due to the prevailing background conditions on these still remain uncertain, for which a multivariate regression trend model has been implemented in this study. Long-term AOD trends across the globe are obtained from the multi-satellite measurements that include MODerate resolution Imaging Spectral-radiometer (MODIS on-board Terra (T) and Aqua (A), between 2001 and 2020), Multi-angle Imaging Spectral-Radiometer (MISR, 2001–2020), and Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP, 2006–2020) observations using both the linear as well as multivariate regression analysis. Before evaluating the trends, a detailed comparison has been made with the ground-based AEronet RObotic NETwork (AERONET) observations (2001–2020) obtained from more than 80 stations covering the globe. A high (above 0.7) to medium (from 0.3 to 0.7) spatial correlation is noticed among all the satellite measurements except the CALIOP (over a few sites) observations. However, MISR (CALIOP) observed AOD values underestimated (overestimated) with that measured by the AERONET AOD over the high aerosol loaded regions. In addition, Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Application version-2 (MERRA-2) AOD dataset is also able to simulate the mean as well as trend values across the globe. A decreasing trend in AOD is mostly seen in connection with the implementation of emission control policies (Eastern North America, Europe, and Eastern and Central China), reduction in forest fires (South America), and the stilling of surface winds over arid regions (Western North Africa). On the other hand, AOD trends perceived over the South Africa region have increased in comparison to the values reported earlier. Surprisingly, the CALIOP sensor has shown a rather significantly decreasing trend values over the Middle-East region. When compared, the region-wise linear regression trend analysis declined to give any statistically significant values over huge aerosol variability regions such as North Africa, South Africa, Middle-East, China, and the Indian regions. These robust findings will form a firm basis to evaluate the dependence of physical and chemical characteristics of aerosol on the observed AOD trends so that the impact of varied aerosols emission sources can be quantified accurately across the different regions.","AERONET,AOD,MERRA-2,Trends,Multi-satellite,"

"north american vegetation dynamics observed with multi-resolution satellite data","2008","We investigated normalized difference vegetation index data from the NOAA series of Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometers and found regions in North America that experienced marked increases in annual photosynthetic capacity at various times from 1982 to 2005. Inspection of these anomalous areas with multi-resolution data from Landsat, Ikonos, aerial photography, and ancillary data revealed a range of causes for the NDVI increases: climatic influences; severe drought and subsequent recovery; irrigated agriculture expansion; insect outbreaks followed by logging and subsequent regeneration; and forest fires with subsequent regeneration. Vegetation in areas in the high Northern Latitudes appear to be solely impacted by climatic influences. In other areas examined, the impact of anthropogenic effects is more direct. The pattern of NDVI anomalies over longer time periods appear to be driven by long-term climate change but most appear to be associated with climate variability on decadal and shorter time scales along with direct anthropogenic land cover conversions. The local variability of drivers of change demonstrates the difficulty in interpreting changes in NDVI and indicates the complex nature of changes in the carbon cycle within North America. Coarse scale analysis of changes could well fail to identify the important local scale drivers controlling the carbon cycle and to identify the relative roles of disturbance and climate change. Our results document regional land cover land use change and climatic influences that have altered continental scale vegetation dynamics in North America.","Landsat,NDVI,Climate,Land cover,Vegetation dynamics,AVHRR,"

"predictive maintenance leveraging machine learning for time-series forecasting in the maritime industry","2020","One of the key challenges in the maritime industry refers to minimizing the time a vessel cannot be utilized, which has multiple effects. The latter is addressed through maintenance approaches that however in many cases are not efficient in terms of cost and downtime. Predictive maintenance provides optimized maintenance scheduling offering extended vessel lifespan, coupled with reduced maintenance costs. As in several industries, including the maritime domain, an increasing amount of data is made available through the deployment and exploitation of data sources, such as on board sensors that provide real-time information. These data provide the required ground for analysis and thus support for various types of data-driven decision making. In the maritime domain, sensors are deployed on vessels to monitor their engines and data analysis tools are needed to assist engineers towards reduced operational risk through predictive maintenance solutions that are put in place. In this paper, we present an approach for anomaly detection on time-series data, utilizing machine learning on the vessels sensor data, in order to predict the condition of specific parts of the vessel's main engine and thus facilitate predictive maintenance.

"spatial patterns of landside trade impedance in containerized south american exports","2017","The paper addresses claims implicating higher domestic transportation costs as a significant barrier to Latin America's trade and economic integration - and the region's inadequate transportation infrastructure as the primary cause. The relative “trade space” for U.S.-bound containerized shipments is delineated via reverse spatial interaction modeling. Reconfiguration and reverse calibration of the doubly constrained spatial interaction model is used to derive functional distances between origins and ports of export, as a means of estimating a Trade Impedance Quotient (TIQ) for trade flows at the scale of the continent. Global and local statistics of spatial autocorrelation are then used to analyze the spatial pattern of trade impedance. With this approach, the analysis of containerized flows establishes the existence, extent, location, and spatial distribution of discrepancies in South American landside trade impedance. A large share of trade flows have trade impedance that is disproportionate to distance. Trade impedance at origins is spatially clustered for the total dataset and randomly distributed for commodity segments, and randomly distributed at destinations. Potential focus areas for high trade impedance are identified.","Spatial interaction modeling,South America,Relative space,Trade Impedance Quotient (TIQ),Trade impedance,Spatial autocorrelation,"

"wide-area spaceborne maritime surveillance system","2017","Wide Area Aerial Surveillance (WAAS) systems are gaining popularity nowadays. The main function of WAAS systems is to obtain high resolution images of a large area and create knowledge to facilitate situational awareness.

"an adaptive threshold fast dbscan algorithm with preserved trajectory feature points for vessel trajectory clustering","2023","Vessel navigation pattern recognition plays an important role in the research of intelligent transportation on water. Clustering using the data stored in The Automatic Identification System (AIS) is a current research hotspot. However, there are three problems in the past clustering analysis. First, the traditional Douglas-Peucker (DP) Compression Algorithm exists feature point loss and trajectory distortion when compressing trajectories. Second, Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm require high time cost. Finally, most of the studies ignore the interaction between parameters when choosing the parameters of DBSCAN. These problems seriously affect the efficiency and accuracy of clustering. To solve these problems, this paper improves the existing methods by (1) Adaptive selection of compression thresholds and trajectory feature points for each trajectory when using the DP algorithm ensures the realism of the compressed trajectory; (2) using the Fast-DTW algorithm to improve the computation speed and ensure the accuracy of trajectory similarity; (3) Self-selection of parameter combinations based on Silhouette Coefficient (SC) scores was achieved using the similarity distribution of the trajectories in combination with an improved K-Adaptive Nearest Neighbors (KANN). The experiments show that the proposed method can greatly reduce the time cost of clustering compared to the original method and significantly outperforms the three compared algorithms in terms of clustering effect images.","Fast-DTW,Ship trajectory clustering,AF-DP,DBSCAN,Navigation pattern recognition,"
"synteo: synthetic dataset generation for earth observation and deep learning – demonstrated for offshore wind farm detection","2022","With the emergence of deep learning in the last years, new opportunities arose in Earth observation research. Nevertheless, they also brought with them new challenges. The data-hungry training processes of deep learning models demand large, resource expensive, annotated datasets and partly replaced knowledge-driven approaches so that model behaviour and the final prediction process became a black box. The proposed SyntEO approach enables Earth observation researchers to automatically generate large deep learning ready datasets by merging existing and procedural data. SyntEO does this by including expert knowledge in the data generation process in a highly structured manner to control the automatic image and label generation by employing an ontology. In this way, fully controllable experiment environments are set up, which support insights in the model training on the synthetic datasets. Thus, SyntEO makes the learning process approachable, which is an important cornerstone for explainable machine learning. We demonstrate the SyntEO approach by predicting offshore wind farms in Sentinel-1 images on two of the worlds largest offshore wind energy production sites. The largest generated dataset has 90,000 training examples. A basic convolutional neural network for object detection, that is only trained on this synthetic data, confidently detects offshore wind farms by minimising false detections in challenging environments. In addition, four sequential datasets are generated, demonstrating how the SyntEO approach can precisely define the dataset structure and influence the training process. SyntEO is thus a hybrid approach that creates an interface between expert knowledge and data-driven image analysis.","Offshore wind farm,Explainable machine learning,Synthetic training data,Deep learning,SyntEO,CNN,"
"lithological and alteration mineral mapping in poorly exposed lithologies using landsat-8 and aster satellite data: north-eastern graham land, antarctic peninsula","2019","Antarctica remains a remote and logistically difficult region to conduct geological field mapping and mineral exploration. Remote sensing satellite imagery has high potential to provide a solution to overcome the difficulties and limitations associated with geological field mapping and mineral exploration in inaccessible regions. In this study, the applications of Landsat-8 and the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) data were investigated to extract geological information for lithological and alteration mineral mapping in poorly exposed lithologies located in inaccessible regions. The north-eastern Graham Land, Antarctic Peninsula (AP) was selected in this study to conduct a satellite-based remote sensing mapping approach. A two-stage methodology was adopted to distinguish pixel and sub-pixel targets in the satellite images. In the first stage, Continuum Removal (CR) spectral mapping tool and Independent Components Analysis (ICA) technique were applied to Landsat-8 and ASTER spectral bands to map the pixels related to poorly exposed lithological units. The second step was established based on the application of target detection algorithms to shortwave infrared bands of ASTER for detecting spectral features attributed to alteration mineral assemblages at the sub-pixel level. Pixels composed of distinctive absorption features of alteration mineral assemblages and Si-O bond emission minima features were detected by applying CR mapping tool to reflective and thermal bands of Landsat-8 and ASTER. Anomaly pixels related to spectral features of Al-O–H, Fe, Mg-O–H and CO3 groups as well as lithological attributions from felsic to mafic rocks were detected by the implementation of ICA technique to reflective and thermal bands of Landsat-8 and ASTER. ICA method provided image maps of alteration mineral assemblages and lithological units (mafic to felsic trend) for poorly mapped and/or unmapped regions. Fractional abundance of alteration minerals such as muscovite, kaolinite, illite, montmorillonite, epidote, chlorite and biotite were detected in poorly exposed lithologies using target detection algorithms. Several prospecting areas for Cu, Mo, Au and Ag mineralization related to propyllitically and argillically altered units of Andean Intrusive Suite (AIS) were identified in the southern sector of the study region. The results of this investigation demonstrated the applicability of Landsat-8 and ASTER spectral data for lithological and alteration mineral mapping in poorly exposed lithologies located in inaccessible regions, particularly using the image processing algorithms that are capable of detecting anomaly pixels and sub-pixel targets in the remotely sensed images, where no prior information is available. In conclusion, a simple and robust satellite-based remote sensing approach for mapping poorly exposed lithologies in inaccessible regions was established, which is comprehensively applicable for lithological and alteration mineral mapping in the Antarctic environments and hydrothermal ore minerals prospecting in other inaccessible regions around the world.","Inaccessible regions,Landsat-8,Antarctic Peninsula,Graham Land,Poorly exposed lithologies,ASTER,Satellite-based remote sensing approach,"

"an iterative learning and inference approach to managing dynamic cyber vulnerabilities of complex systems","2020","As modern infrastructure systems become increasingly reliant on cyber technologies and continue to be integrated with physical systems, managing risks from deliberate and non-deliberate sources is a significant research challenge. Unlike strictly physical systems, cyber-enabled physical systems are influenced by dynamic and evolving technologies, environments, and attack mechanisms. As a result, vulnerabilities are rapidly changing and difficult to detect and manage. While there is recent interest in the dynamic properties of performance through resilience analysis, limited research addresses the dynamic nature of cyber-system vulnerability. This paper presents an iterative data-driven learning approach to evaluate and manage vulnerabilities for such complex systems. These time-varying system health characteristics may not be directly observable, but can be inferred using observable indicators. The approach recognizes that multiple types of vulnerabilities need to be included in a holistic system health assessment. The methods are applied to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) database containing thousands of documented cybersecurity vulnerabilities over nearly two decades. We acknowledge the dynamic properties of cyber vulnerability, while also inferring system health using observable data and hidden operational states. The results will be of interest to managers of large-scale cyber-enabled physical systems who are seeking to prioritize system health investments.","Markov model,Probabilistic inference,System resilience,Cybersecurity,Cyber vulnerability,Statistical learning,"

"changes in the supply of eastern mediterranean glasses to visigothic spain","2019","This study presents the first comprehensive analysis of glass compositions from Visigothic Spain using high resolution laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS). Major, minor and trace element patterns of 169 well-dated samples from three rural Iberian sites (Congosto, Gózquez and El Pelícano) have brought to light major chronological developments in the production, circulation and use of glass between the fifth and the eighth century CE. The data identify four distinct compositional groups of Egyptian and Levantine origin. Egyptian Foy 2.1, Foy 2.1 high Fe and so-called Magby alongside Apollonia-type Levantine I were the main glass types of the Visigothic period. Due to the tight dating of the majority of the samples, we were able to reveal fundamental changes in the geographical scope of glass supplies to the Iberian Peninsula, and to refine the chronological range of the known primary production groups. The glass group commonly known as série 2.1 or Foy 2.1 started being produced already during the second half of the fifth century. The appearance of Foy 2.1 high Fe can likewise be moved forward to the first half of the sixth century. A plant-ash group referred to as Magby was introduced around the middle of the sixth century. Egypt was undeniably the main supplier of raw glasses to the Iberian Peninsula up to the mid-sixth century CE, after which the Levantine I group became the prime glass type among the analysed assemblages. In the final stages of the Visigothic Kingdom and the early years of Islamic dominion, there is a noticeable drop in the absolute quantity of glass available, together with an increase in recycling. The implications of these transformations in the supply of glass for the organisation of Mediterranean trade are discussed.","Levantine I,Foy 2.1,Recycling,Foy 2.1 high Fe,Magby,Foy 2.2,LA-ICP-MS,"
"a spatiotemporal clustering approach to maritime domain awareness","2013","Spatiotemporal clustering is the process of grouping objects based on both their spatial and temporal similarity. This approach is useful when considering the distance between objects and how that distance changes through time. Spatiotemporal clustering analysis is applied to the maritime domain in this paper, specifically to a defined area of water, during a period of time, in order to gain behavioral knowledge of vessel interactions and provide the opportunity to screen such interactions for further investigation. The proposed spatiotemporal clustering algorithm spatially clusters vessels in the water space using k-means clustering analysis, kinematically refines the clusters based on the similarity of vessel headings, speeds and the distance between them, and temporally analyzes the continuity of membership of the kinematic clusters through time to determine which clusters are moving. The algorithm is implemented in the MATLAB programming environment, verified with a synthetic data scenario, and validated with two real-world datasets.","Kinematics,spatiotemporal clustering algorithm,Clustering algorithms,Spatiotemporal phenomena,Spatiotemporal clustering,maritime domain awareness,Global Positioning System,MATLAB programming,Filtering,marine safety,maritime domain,vessel headings,vessel interaction,water space,marine communication,Visualization,Algorithm design and analysis,k-means clustering analysis,vessel speeds,Arrays,"
"a lightweight approach to simulate a 2d radar coverage for virtual maritime environments","2013","Virtual simulation systems present a cost effective way of training the mariners to navigate a ship in a realistic maritime environment. To offer a better training session, a need arises to model other tools and components as a part of the virtual simulation system, such as radar, sonar and telescope, that are used to navigate a vessel in the real world. Taking a light-weighted approach, we developed a virtual radar coverage for the Vidusayura virtual maritime learning environment. It simulates an actual marine radar, which gathers information of its surroundings from the virtual environment with which a trainee naval officer interacts.

"mobile edge communications, computing, and caching (mec3) technology in the maritime communication network","2020","With the increasing maritime activities and the rapidly developing maritime economy, the fifth-generation (5G) mobile communication system is expected to be deployed at the ocean. New technologies need to be explored to meet the requirements of ultra-reliable and low latency communications (URLLC) in the maritime communication network (MCN). Mobile edge computing (MEC) can achieve high energy efficiency in MCN at the cost of suffering from high control plane latency and low reliability. In terms of this issue, the mobile edge communications, computing, and caching (MEC3) technology is proposed to sink mobile computing, network control, and storage to the edge of the network. New methods that enable resource-efficient configurations and reduce redundant data transmissions can enable the reliable implementation of computing-intension and latency-sensitive applications. The key technologies of MEC3 to enable URLLC are analyzed and optimized in MCN. The best response-based offloading algorithm (BROA) is adopted to optimize task offloading.

"sediment geochemistry in coastal maritime antarctica (admiralty bay, king george island): evidence from rare earths and other elements","2007","We report the concentrations of 22 elements in short coastal sediment cores of Admiralty Bay (King George Island, Antarctica) determined by Neutron Activation Analysis. We focus the discussion on rare earth elements (REE) because their fractionation patterns in sediments relative to local sources may offer insights about weathering, transportation, deposition, and diagenetic processes. We found strong correlations between REE and Th, indicating detrital origin. Despite strong Eh gradients, the Th-normalized redox-sensitive elements (e.g., Eu, Ce, Fe, As, and others) showed little variability within the sedimentary environment. The exceptions were U (depleted in the upper few centimeters) and Br (enriched in the upper few centimeters). While U appears to be removed from seawater via uptake across the boundary of reducing sediments, the mechanisms driving Br accumulation are unclear, but perhaps related to increasing diatom production driven by regional warming. A comparison with published concentrations from rocks representing the regional eroding units showed that the characteristics of source rock could be recognized in the REE fractionation patterns in our sediments. These results imply no significant alteration during weathering and sediment transport in the coastal region of Admiralty Bay and the prevalence of strong periglacial erosion in ice-free areas of maritime Antarctica in spite of the relatively mild regional environmental setting (e.g., high moisture and high temperatures).","Heavy metal,Diagenesis,REE,NAA,Bromine,Sediment,Antarctica,Weathering,Coastal environment,"

"systematic knowledge-based product redesign: an empirical study of solar power system for unmanned transport ship","2023","Product redesign is widely required in the process of product innovation, which greatly depends on a series of innovative theories of product. Traditional product redesign can identify functional requirements from customer needs by functional analysis and utilize inventive principles of TRIZ to address the problems. However, the relationships between the customer needs (CNs), engineering parameters (EPs), and inventive principles (IPs) has not been explored, which may limit and hinder the opportunity for product innovation. To improve the design efficiency, Random Forest (RF) is introduced in this method to mine the relationship between EPs and IPs by researching many cases for design knowledge. A systematic redesign process is proposed to apply the design knowledge. Firstly, functional analysis is used to decompose customer needs (CNs) into product functions. And then, the effect-based approach which is the application of scientific laws is used to transform functions into EPs. Secondly, IPs are recommended based on EPs by a trained RF model. Finally, the specific solution is generated from the problem domain using the analogy design based on the Su-Field model. The effectiveness of the method is verified in the redesign of solar power systems for unmanned transport ships.","Effect-based approach,Functional analysis,Random Forest (RF),Product redesign,Analogy design,Theory of innovation problem solving (TRIZ),"
"novel maritime channel models for millimeter radiowaves","2016","This work presents and analyzes the results of millimeter-wave propagation simulations performed for over the sea LoS ship to ship communication channels. We present a channel characterization study where channel parameters such as path loss, received power, RMS delay spread, and power delay profile are obtained by using a ray tracing approach. 5G candidate frequencies, 35 GHz and 94 GHz were chosen as the primary bands of interest since these two bands have minimum water and oxygen attenuation, thereby promising better performance among the other frequency bands. Our results indicate that 2-ray analytical propagation loss model should only be used for short ranges over the sea surface propagation at typical frequencies considered by 5G. However, free space path loss model cannot predict the behavior of channel over the sea surface in high frequencies even for short ranges. Therefore, in this study a new model that is the modified version of 2-ray path loss model is proposed, in which a coefficient in the power of exponential function is introduced to better predict the behavior of maritime channels of 5G. It is shown that the proposed model can predict the path loss of maritime channel better than the existing models.","ray tracing,millimeter radiowaves,free space path loss model,Ducts,wireless path loss,Delays,Mathematical model,Maritime channel modeling,novel maritime channel models,Predictive models,radiowaves,oxygen attenuation,exponential function,sea surface propagation,millimeter wave propagation simulations,Propagation losses,Sea surface,propagation loss model,sea LoS ship,maritime channels,channel parameters,wireless channels,marine communication,Receivers,ship communication channels,"

"the future of the technology-based manufacturing in the european union","2023","The manufacturing industry tries to innovate always to cater to customer-oriented products. The digitization of manufacturing is revolutionizing the future of this industry. The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is bringing down the labor cost, reducing the machine downtime, and overall increasing the production speed. A new technological trend like Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that uses computer algorithms based on available data and can improve or decide further, automatically, based on experience, without the need for prior programming commands. ML can improve daily processes for identifying bottlenecks, developing products, controlling quality, providing security to the industry, and using AI robotics in place of humans. On one hand, technologies like ML, AI, IIoT, new materials, photonics, and rapid prototyping are driving the manufacturing sector in adopting a future version of Industry 4.0, and on the other hand, the European Commission (EC) has defined a roadmap until 2050 or more, in achieving the sustainable goal of carbon-neutrality and complete digitalization with resilience across the European continent. However, it is challenging to match the planned and actual roadmaps to the future of the technology-based manufacturing industry. There are uncertainties about how the future will be shaped by technologies in the EU manufacturing industry, in the changing political, environmental and social world environment. Recognizing these difficulties, the current article consults the available literature on this topic to determine the factors that will characterize the future of the manufacturing industry across EU countries. The relevant information about the EU manufacturing sectors has first been collected from various sources like Eurostat data, the EC policy documents, manufacturing company's annual reports, research reviews, journal articles, EU Industry Days annual event, etc. Then the collected data were analyzed to gain insight into the future of the technology-based EU manufacturing industry in the context of the European Commission's outlined policies. Variable factors from different manufacturing sectors are presented from different EU member states and scenario analysis was used for understanding the possible future. It is concluded that the future does not lie in adapting to the changing environment but in creating the future by EU companies themselves - revolution must be met by revolution. Their early experiences and path dependency can be seen as stubbornness, which may act as formidable barriers to building new capabilities. Therefore, companies must step-wise integrate resources to create a new process, and new structure, with personnel motivation, that fits with the broader European context in the coming decades.","Digitalization,Management,Carbon-neutrality,EU,Manufacturing,"
"risk-driven intent assessment and response generation in maritime surveillance operations","2015","Decision support systems (DSSs) are playing an increasingly important role in the characterization of suspicious activities in an area of interest given their proved ability to turn vast amounts of raw data into actionable intelligence that is easy to understand by human operators. Although risk management is an integral component of the decision making process that directly contributes towards improved situational awareness and response assessment, an active end-to-end consideration of the underlying risk sources in the environment is still an important feature that most DSSs currently lack. Additionally, deciding on an appropriate course of action (COA) to mitigate emerging threats in the system is a challenging task even for domain experts given that (1) the number of potential responses to analyze could be overwhelmingly large; (2) seldom are those responses judged in terms of the risks associated with their enactment and (3) assessing the effectiveness of the potential responses in the real world is usually time-consuming and simulation-driven. In this paper, we formalize the adaptation of a recently proposed Risk Management Framework to account for behavioral intents associated with the objects of interest (OOIs) in the monitoring environment and their link to automatic response generation. The intent of the objects is inferred from high-level cognitive and behavioral knowledge in the form of anomalies. When an OOI has crossed a permissible risk threshold, we demonstrate how responses to that situation can be automatically elicited by the COA recommendation module of a risk-aware DSS. Multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) is used to judge a diverse set of plausible responses according to different operational objectives. We illustrate the application of the proposed framework in the context of maritime surveillance operations by triggering a corporate search for a missing vessel. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that risk features are synthesized from anomalies and integrated into a more comprehensive RMF engine for knowledge (response) elicitation.","decision support systems,surveillance,automatic response generation,Risk management,Hidden Markov models,risk-aware DSS,Conferences,Feature extraction,behavioral knowledge,intent and threat assessment,Meteorology,marine systems,marine safety,COA recommendation module,cognitive knowledge,behavioral intents,risk management,operations research,MCDA,situational awareness,risk-driven response generation,course of action recommendation,high-level information fusion,course of action,RMF engine,Decision support systems,objects of interest,multicriteria decision making,maritime surveillance operations,multicriteria decision analysis,corporate search,OOI,risk management framework,Surveillance,risk-driven intent assessment,"

This study investigates the trend and variability of rainfall in the IKN and two buffer cities and its relation to hydrometeorological disasters. We analyze 20 years of Integrated Multi-Satellite Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) version 6 data and hydrometeorological disaster information from the National Agency for Disaster Countermeasure. The annual rainfall, the extreme rain index of R95p (number of very wet days), and R99p (number of very extremely wet days) show a slightly decreasing trend. However, the index of consecutive wet days (CWD) increases, resembling the rising number of floods and landslides. Rainfall shows robust seasonal and diurnal variations. Peak rainfall occurs in November–December and March–April, while the driest period is observed during August–October. Dry months associated with El-Nino, can cause severe dry conditions and increase the potential for catastrophic forest fires. The peak precipitation amount and frequency were observed in the early morning and the second peak in the afternoon. Mainland areas tend to have a peak occurring later than those on the coast and ocean.

"the regional protocol for local communications among maritime autonomous surface ships based on vdes","2023","In order to provide more collision avoidance information to ships that may encounter each other in dense sea areas, prevent collision events, and minimize channel data pressure, ensure network reliability and reduce latency, this paper proposes a regional protocol for local communications among maritime autonomous surface ships based on VDES (High Frequency Data Exchange System). Based on the theoretical foundation of the ship domain model in the field of ships, the area where collision danger exists is found by guiding the ship domain model, and this area is used as the routing flood area, and the routing request is limited to this area. The improved AODV (Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector) routing forwarding algorithm is used to establish a communication link between ships in the routing request area using real-time location information. This can exchange more information with ships located in the collision risk area to assist in collaborative obstacle avoidance and prevent accidents. At the same time, it effectively avoids network-wide routing flooding, avoids network congestion, and ensures network stability. Simulation analysis shows that this protocol is superior to AIS in terms of delivery rate and delay on the basis of realizing business functions. This will be beneficial for obstacle avoidance between encountering ships.","channel data pressure,maritime autonomous surface ships,Marine vehicles,Delays,marine navigation,AODV routing protocol,regional protocol,communication link,routing protocols,high frequency data exchange system,ship field model,collision danger,collision risk area,Routing protocols,ships,marine safety,Stability criteria,collision avoidance information,network-wide routing flooding,telecommunication congestion control,mobile radio,Sea surface,routing request area,Collaboration,collaborative obstacle avoidance,collision events,dense sea areas,routing flood area,encountering ships,Routing,mobile robots,real-time location information,collision avoidance,ship domain model,VDES,local communications,network reliability,regional routing protocol,"

"supporting maritime search and rescue missions through uas-based wireless localization","2018","The use of unmanned aircraft systems to support maritime search and rescue missions holds great potential. Applications range from the fast and efficient search of vessels and persons in distress to the provision of rescue and communication resources. In this paper, we address a received signal strength based localization method of persons without dedicated search and rescue equipment. The specific challenge addressed in this work is to analyze the proposed localization method under realistic conditions. Thus, a maritime channel model is implemented and by means of field tests experimentally validated. Furthermore, the proposed approach is evaluated in a two step concept: In the first step the capability of different search patterns and localization algorithms is analyzed and evaluated in a hardware in the loop simulation environment. In the second step, a scaled experimental setup, which uses a technology comparable to cellular communications, is evaluated to prove the viability of the overall system. Besides the overall accuracy, the required localization time is a key performance indicator. The resulting outcome of the simulations using active trajectory generation underlines the potential of the discussed approach by achieving localization errors of lower than 200 m in under 10 mins.

"organic contaminants in bats: trends and new issues","2014","Exposure to contaminants, often pesticides, has been implicated as a major factor contributing to decreases in bat populations. Bats provide essential ecosystem services and a sustained, thriving population is vital for ecosystem health. Understanding issues threatening their survival is crucial for their protection and conservation. This paper provides the first review for 12years on organic pollutants in bats and aims to investigate trends and any new issues impacting bat resilience. Organochlorine (OC) pesticides have been reported most often, especially in the older literature, with the dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) metabolite, dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), present at highest concentrations in tissues analyzed. The OC pesticide concentrations reported in bat tissues have declined significantly since the late 1970s, presumably as a result of restrictions in use. For example, DDE study mean concentrations over time periods 1970–1980, 1981–1999 and 2000–2013 ranged from 2.6-62, 0.05–2.31, 0.08–0.19ppm wet weight, respectively. Exposure, however, still occurs from remaining residues, many years after the compounds have been actively used. In recent years (2000–2013), a range of other organic chemicals have been reported in bat tissues including brominated flame retardants (polybrominated diphenyl ether at a mean concentration of 2.9ppm lipid weight) and perfluorinated compounds (perfluorooctanyl sulfonate at a mean concentration 0.09ppm wet weight). The persistent organic compounds concentrate in tissues with higher fat content notably back-depot fat. Numerous factors influence exposure, residues detected and concentrations in different individuals, species and tissues which must be understood to provide meaningful assessment of the impacts of exposure. Exposure can lead to not only acute and lethal impacts, but also physiological sub-lethal and chronic effects, often linked to the annual cycle of fat deposition and withdrawal. Current challenges for bat conservation include collation of a more extensive and standardized database of bat exposure, especially to current use pesticides and emerging contaminants, and better prediction and definition of toxicity end points notably for the sub-lethal effects. Understanding sub-lethal effects will be of greater importance for sustaining populations in the longer-term.","Bats,Organic contaminants,Pesticides,Mortality,"
"cross-layer analysis of error control in underwater wireless sensor networks","2012","Several error control schemes have been introduced for Underwater Wireless Sensor Networks (UWSNs) to combat the effects of high error rates. However, these schemes have only been evaluated based on point-to-point communication metrics and do not consider the different underwater propagation phenomena. On the other hand, the unique properties of UWSNs such as the three-dimensional architecture and the underwater channel characteristics prevent existing studies of error control schemes for terrestrial sensor networks to be applied to this domain. In this paper, a cross-layer analysis framework is developed to evaluate existing error control techniques in three-dimensional multi-hop UWSNs. The developed framework captures the effects of automatic repeat request (ARQ), forward error correction (FEC), and hybrid ARQ schemes on end-to-end energy, latency, and packet error rate. In addition, different underwater propagation phenomena are considered with a particular attention on the presence of shadow zones. The theoretical analysis and the numerical evaluations reveal that exploiting FEC schemes with channel-aware routing reduces the end-to-end energy consumption and latency under all propagation phenomena for all water depths in UWSNs. The selection of the suitable error control scheme depends also on the water depth (shallow/deep water) and on the different underwater propagation phenomena.","Underwater networking,ARQ,Hybrid ARQ,Cross-layer analysis,FEC,"

To maximize their performance, these tools should be able to combine automatic capturing of normal behavior from data with domain knowledge in the form of human descriptions. In a proposed Joint Statistical and Symbolic Anomaly Detection System, statistical and symbolic methods are tightly integrated in order to detect the majority of critical events in the situation while minimizing unwanted alerts.

"sperm whale (physeter macrocephalus) acoustic ecology at ocean station papa in the gulf of alaska – part 1: detectability and seasonality","2019","Sperm whales Physeter macrocephalus produce loud, stereotypical click sequences and are an ideal species to be studied with passive acoustic techniques. To increase our limited knowledge of sperm whale occurrence patterns in remote and inaccessible locations of the North Pacific, we analyzed a five-year-long (June 2007–April 2012) acoustic data set recorded at Ocean Station PAPA (OSP; 50°N, 145°W) in the Gulf of Alaska (GOA). Firstly, we assessed the sperm whale detection performance of the Passive Aquatic Listener (PAL), and secondly, we investigated temporal patterns of sperm whale presence at OSP. The PAL proved highly efficient, with above 50% probability of detecting more than two sperm whales, a condition met for over 50% of the recordings. Results indicated that sperm whale clicks were recorded year-round, with a clear seasonal pattern. The number of detections during the summer months was approximately 70% higher compared to winter. An ambient noise analysis showed that differences in detection rates were likely not driven by seasonal changes in ambient noise levels. The average propagation range of sperm whale clicks ranged between 7 and 8 km between summer and winter, with slightly decreased detection distances observed in winter. Seasonal shifts in the intensity of the Alaska Current and the latitudinal oscillations of the North Pacific Transition Zone results in changes in water mixing, transport of nutrients and the concentration of prey such as squid, which likely drives sperm whale distribution.","Ocean Station PAPA,Sperm whale (),North Pacific Transition Zone,Passive Aquatic Listener,Gulf of Alaska,Passive Acoustic Monitoring,Seasonality,"

"experimental comparison of ad hoc methods for classification of maritime vessels based on real-life ais data","2018","Classification of Maritime Vessels is a recurrent task in maritime surveillance systems. Classification can be conducted by different methods, e.g., NaÃ¯ve Bayes, k Nearest Neighbor, Decision Tree, Fuzzy Rule, or Neural Networks. The Automatic Identification System (AIS) is cooperative system of VHF-radio data exchange. By broadcasting of navigational data and ships' information it supports maritime safety, surveillance, and information. Based on measured AIS datasets of five maritime hotspots, easily implementable standard classification (i.e. ad hoc) methods from Data Science are compared to each other. These are evaluated in terms of accuracy. This experimental evaluation is motivated by the following question: Tip to which degree properties and behavior, e.g., vessel's type, can be detected by using large quantities of ship's positional, motion, and dimensions' data as provided by AIS?

"feasibility of investment in blue growth multiple-use of space and multi-use platform projects; results of a novel assessment approach and case studies","2019","Blue Growth is the creation of economic activity and jobs at sea, while multiple use of space makes efficient use of the available sea area by combining industries. Clearly there are many combinations and many value propositions. However, most technologies to date are considered blue sky concepts, with little robust techno-economic analysis demonstrating profitability. The paper begins by providing a comprehensive review of Blue Growth and multi-use in Blue Growth; both in policy as well as the wide range of current technologies, including ocean energy, offshore wind energy, offshore aquaculture and desalination. The Maribe H2020 project provides the vehicle for the research element of the paper. The major contribution is a new methodology for selecting, filtering, developing and ranking business propositions for multiple-use of space (MUS) and multi-use platforms (MUP). Application of the method for the first time identified three case studies where Blue Growth combination projects can be economically viable, with attractive internal rate of return (IRRs). Results presented for the case studies report standard investment metrics and show the relative contribution of each product (energy, food, water) to the system profitability, as well as socio-economic impact. Existing companies were fully engaged in the process. Co-creation between sector experts and industry led to both improved business value propositions and robust assessment of investment readiness. In contrast to the presumption that large scale platforms are commercially attractive, the highest ranking case study companies required smaller capital expenditure (CAPEX) and operated in niche subsectors. In conclusion, the positive economic performance of the case studies should provide confidence for the EC as well as investors that MUS and MUP have viable economic futures leading towards commercialisation. The macro and micro assessment methods will be particularly useful in other Blue Economy contexts and in other multiple product contexts.","Aquaculture,Multi-use platform,Blue Growth,Techno-economics,Multiple-use of space,Ocean energy,"

"gnss integrity concepts for maritime users","2019","Some of the most important parameters of operational requirements for Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) are integrity, continuity, accuracy, availability and coverage. These requirements, most strictly formalized in aviation, are based on risk analysis, considering risk exposure time and critical risk exposure time. However, the GNSS user requirements in maritime domain are still not clearly set. GNSS offers worldwide coverage at a sufficient position data quality and though other means of ship's position fixing are available at sea, the use of GNSS devices is generally the most preferred method of producing valid position data. Primary means for electronic position fixing currently in use in majority of merchant ships are shipborne autonomous GPS receivers or DGPS IALA receivers. More advanced GNSS receivers able to process signals from GPS, GLONASS, Chinese Beidou, European Galileo, regional Indian IRNSS, and satellite based augmentation systems (SBAS) are still rare. But it is expected that such combined or multi-system receivers will soon become more common in maritime transport.To be prepared for a malfunction of any GNSS devices for maritime applications and e-Navigation specifically, their state of the art integrity monitoring should be developed and standardized analogously to other transport domains. The issues of existing requirements, performance standards, and future concepts of maritime GNSS integrity are discussed in this paper.","satellite based augmentation systems,operational requirements,integrity monitoring,GNSS,Radio navigation,Receivers,Standards,electronic position fixing,e-Navigation,maritime GNSS integrity,Monitoring,integrity,Global Navigation Satellite System,PNT,Global navigation satellite system,marine navigation,Global Positioning System,maritime users,"
"bistatic sar maritime ship target 3-d image reconstruction method without distortion in local cartesian coordinate","2023","Bistatic synthetic aperture radar (BiSAR) has been attracting worldwide attention because of its forward-looking imaging and high anti-interference. In harsh environment, it is vital for BiSAR to conduct extensive surveillance, imaging, and recognition of maritime ship targets. However, under the disturbance of sea waves, the ship target has an unknown and massive 3-D rotation, so that its imaging projection plane (IPP) is also undetermined. Thus, high-dimensional random distortion appears in imaging results, making it difficult to recognize the target through 2-D distorted images effectively. To solve these problems, BiSAR maritime ship target 3-D image reconstruction method without distortion in local Cartesian coordinate (LCC) is proposed. In this article, according to positions of scatterers and rotation parameters, significant differences of different scatterers of maritime ship targets have been found in bistatic range, Doppler centroid (DC), and Doppler frequency rate (DFR), which lays a solid foundation for the scatterer separation of ship targets. On this basis, a 3-D R-DC-DFR domain is constructed, and 2-D echoes of the maritime ship target are projected into R-DC-DFR domain to separate scatterers. Then, by remapping data of transmitter and receiver in R-DC-DFR domain to LCC, as well as evaluating their similarity metric, the optimal rotation parameters of the ship target can be obtained via the maximal similarity. Therefore, the image distortion caused by the unknown IPP has been removed, and 3-D image reconstruction of ship targets can be realized without distortion in the LCC. Furthermore, to evaluate performances of 3-D image reconstruction for different rotation parameters and bistatic configurations, 3-D reconstruction index is proposed and analyzed. Both point-targets and maritime ship targets are simulated to emphasize the effectiveness of the proposed method.","local Cartesian coordinate,bistatic synthetic aperture radar (BiSAR),marine radar,R-DC-DFR domain,Image reconstruction,maritime ship target,Marine vehicles,bistatic SAR maritime ship target 3-D image reconstruction method,high-dimensional random distortion,Transmitters,Synthetic aperture radar,geophysical image processing,3-D reconstruction,ships,synthetic aperture radar,image distortion,image reconstruction,radar imaging,Doppler effect,BiSAR maritime ship target,2-D distorted images,imaging projection plane,Receivers,Imaging,point-targets,remote sensing by radar,local Cartesian coordinate (LCC),oceanographic techniques,"
"the sensitivity to metocean data on using data-driven methods for a valemax vessel speed prediction","2022","Accurate ship speed prediction is not only important for economic benefits and emission reduction, but also plays a vital role in making satisfactory routing plans. To investigate a speed prediction method of the largest bulk carriers ever constructed, we firstly compare several widely-used data-driven methods and then pick out the most appropriate model for the prediction task. Being as the input attributes of the data-driven models, the metocean data are collected from forecasting products and carefully cleaned up by data pre-processing steps. However, we have observed from literatures that the data for training are mostly collected from observational systems, such as the noon-reports, sensor measurements, on-board monitoring systems and reanalysis products, which may have certain differences with the data from forecasting systems. To figure out whether the data inconsistency problem will affect the model effectiveness on prediction, exhaustive experiments of a sensitivity study are carried out by utilizing observational data for training models while testing the prediction performance with forecasting data.","Valemax vessels,Data inconsistency,Data-driven methods,Speed prediction,Sensitivity study,"
"varying-scale hca-dbscan-based anomaly detection method for multi-dimensional energy data in steel industry","2023","The quality of the acquisition data in the energy system of steel industry is the basis of prediction analysis and scheduling operation. Facing with its multi-dimensional and high-noise characteristics, in this study, an anomaly detection method based on a varying-scale hypercube accelerated density based spatial clustering for applications with noise (VHCA-DBSCAN) is proposed. An HCA-DBSCAN model based on the Gaussian probability density estimation is firstly established, in which the searching radius is adaptively calculated to identify the suspected outliers efficiently. Then, a traversal search strategy for hypercube segmentation is designed, where the lengths of the edges are varying according to the characteristics of each dimension. Finally, a modified local outlier factor (LOF) by using the approximate upper boundary is presented to evaluate the degree of the suspected outliers, and the confirmed ones are identified by collaboratively considering the manufacturing signals. Validation experiments by employing real-world data from a typical steel enterprise are carried out, and the results indicate that the proposed method exhibits reliable performance and high efficiency when facing with the anomaly detection problem of multi-dimensional industrial data.","Anomaly detection,Varying-scale HCA-DBSCAN,Multi-dimensional energy data,Steel industry,"

"augmented ship tracking under occlusion conditions from maritime surveillance videos","2020","Ship tracking provides crucial on-site microscopic kinematic traffic information which benefits maritime traffic flow analysis, ship safety enhancement, traffic control, etc., and thus has attracted considerable research attentions in the maritime surveillance community. Conventional ship tracking methods yield satisfied results by exploring distinct visual ship features in maritime images, which may fail when the target ship is partially or fully sheltered by obstacles (e.g., ships, waves, etc.) in maritime videos. To overcome the difficulty, we propose an augmented ship tracking framework via the kernelized correlation filter (KCF) and curve fitting algorithm. First, the KCF model is introduced to track ships in the consecutive maritime images and obtain raw ship trajectory dataset. Second, the data anomaly detection and rectification procedure are implemented to rectify the contaminated ship positions. For the purpose of performance evaluation, we implement the proposed framework and another three popular ship tracking models on the four typical ship occlusion videos. The experimental results show that our proposed framework successfully tracks ships in maritime video clips with high accuracy (i.e., the average root mean square error (RMSE), root mean square percentage error (RMSPE), mean absolute deviation (MAD) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) are less than 10), which significantly outperforms the other popular ship trackers.","Smart ship,maritime surveillance videos,Marine vehicles,Feature extraction,maritime traffic flow analysis,augmented ship tracking,ship trajectory dataset,on-site microscopic kinematic traffic information,visual ship features,Videos,kernelized correlation filter,object tracking,ships,marine safety,marine engineering,Target tracking,object detection,feature extraction,maritime images,Correlation,curve fitting algorithm,image filtering,video signal processing,Training,curve fitting,ship occlusion videos,data anomaly detection,Visualization,traffic control,ship occlusion,traffic engineering computing,ship safety enhancement,video surveillance,visual ship tracking,"

"chapter 1 - introduction","2019","nanIndustry transforms materials into finished products by executing activities in manufacturing or chemical transformation processes. Changes in the economic and social environment impact human behavior and interfere in the accomplishment of the task. These changes require skills from the leaders in intuitive emergency response that positively correspond to the team behavior. Conceptual and/or mathematical models are elaborated to simulate human behavior, identifying possible failures from workers, anticipating an occurrence. The industry needs discussions about emerging social or individual movements to predict future failures. Risk management and analysis of events that compose the accident indicate the importance of signals in the analysis of the failure anatomy. Human reliability programs measure operational failure rate, likelihood of human error, mean time between failures, social relationships at workstation, and the impact on task success. Complex processes require higher perception of the anatomy of failure and demand new competence to perform the task, which require worker’s mental and physical health. There are pathologies that affect the worker and induce human errors. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze and diagnose the human factors that are part of the activity in the workstation. In the discussion of human reliability, a historical view of schools, worldwide, related to this area of knowledge is presented. In view of interpretations from contents taught in schools and the expertise of researchers and specialists, the following is highlighted this chapter: worker’s relationships in the workstation, the execution of the task scheduled in routine and in emergencies.

"attribute-based secure data aggregation for isolated iot-enabled maritime transportation systems","2023","With global economic integration, transnational trade plays an important role, and maritime transportation is one of the important means of freight transportation. It is of great significance to build a secure and efficient maritime transportation system (MTS). The introduction of Internet of things technology makes MTS more perfect. The IoT-enabled MTS is composed of marine terminals and on-board sensors, land-based data centers and base stations, as well as satellite networks. Many researchers have carried out significant work to aggregate data in MTS. However, because the terrestrial base stations cannot cover most of the sea area, the isolated maritime terminals, those who drive to the area without base station coverage, need the assistance of satellite networks to complete the contact with the data center. In this paper, we propose an attribute based secure data aggregation scheme for isolated IoT-enabled MTS. In the novel scheme, the constant attributes of a maritime terminal are utilized to generate its certification. In addition, on-board sensors are introduced in the system to help aggregate the status and surrounding environment of the maritime terminal. These monitoring data are encrypted by the sensors and transmitted to the data center for the trustworthiness evaluation of the isolated maritime terminal.

Specifically, an energy-limited delay tolerant networking (DTN) node deployed in the ocean receives/transmits data from/to vessels within its communication range. To further save the energy, a long-term energy minimization problem is formulated with sleeping scheduling and opportunistic transmission.

"radar parameters influence on the clutter in maritime forward scatter radar","2014","The development of Forward Scatter Radar (FSR) for use in maritime applications requires a fundamental understanding of the operating environment. Presently, there is insufficiency of published experimental FSR sea clutter data at near zero grazing angle over the sea. Such data is fundamental for the development of FSR systems for maritime applications. Therefore clutter experiments have been undertaken and data has been recorded at frequencies of 7.5 GHz and 24 GHz with static, medium gain antennas for low sea state 1-3 on the Douglas scale.

"experimental assessment of long-term performance degradation for a pv power plant operating in a desert maritime climate","2022","Photovoltaic (PV) installations are being intensively deployed and their capacity are approaching to terawatt around the world. In this context, the long-term performance and reliability of PV modules, component and systems are critical metrics for the economic viability of PV power plants. Furthermore, this is linked to the environmental conditions in which the PV plants operate. In this study, the performance degradation of a 302.4 kWp solar PV power plant is investigated over the first five years of operation in the desert maritime climate of Djibouti. The analysis is led on collected data extracted from the PV installation and that have been pre-processed and filtered. For this purpose, several criteria have been introduced to identify anomalies such as grid outages. Then, the power degradation rate was considered using Photovoltaics for Utility Scale Applications (PVUSA) regression analysis and Performance Ratio (PR) analysis based on continuous monitoring data at 1-min intervals. The degradation rates were found to be 1.01 ± 0.38%/year for PR and 0.085 ± 0.68%/year for PVUSA. According that the PVUSA did not detect any degradation, new test conditions that were set by experimental data have been introduced. Finally, the resulting measure allowed a degradation rate of 0.74 ± 0.29%/year to be observed.","Performance ratio,PVUSA regression,Grid-connected photovoltaic plant,Degradation rate,Data pre-processing,Dust impact,"
"continuous risk-aware response generation for maritime supply chain disruption mitigation","2017","Supply chains in the current world require extensive use of transportation modes. In combination with ever growing supply chain streamlining efforts, supply chains are particularly vulnerable to disruptions that cause profound effects on downstream actors. Much information is needed to mitigate disruptions, information that could be gathered via a maritime Internet of Things (mIoT). In this paper, we put forth a methodology to detect potentially disruptive events in a maritime supply chain and generate candidate mitigating responses. The proposed framework places risk as the cornerstone of the data-driven analysis and uses a multi-criteria decision approach to propose appropriate actions. An application of the system to mitigate a disruption in a maritime segment of a supply chain is studied. Solutions are composed of combinations of actions to reduce the consequences of a disruption. This system is validated through a scenario in which a weather event causes a disruption in maritime transportation destined to fulfill a supply contract. Finally, conclusions on the system are provided.","continuous risk-aware response generation,transportation,production engineering computing,Transportation,supply chain management,decision making,maritime Internet of Things,marine engineering,maritime supply chain disruption mitigation,Sociology,Marine vehicles,Robot sensing systems,Storms,Supply chains,Internet of Things,Contracts,maritime transportation,risk analysis,"
"collaborative multiple access and energy-efficient resource allocation in distributed maritime wireless networks","2022","With the rapid increasing of maritime activities, maritime wireless networks (MWNs) with high reliability, high energy efficiency, and low delay are required. However, the centralized networking with fixed resource scheduling is not suitable for MWNs due to the special environment. In this paper, we introduce the collaborative relay communication in distributed MWNs to improve the link reliability, and propose an orthogonal time-frequency resource block reservation based multiple access (RRMA) scheme for both one-hop direct link and two-hop collaborative relay link to reduce the interference. To further improve the network performance, we formulate an energy efficiency (EE) maximization resource allocation problem and solve it by an iterative algorithm based on the Dinkelbach method. Finally, numerical results are provided to investigate the proposed RRMA scheme and resource allocation algorithm, showing that the low outage probability and transmission delay can be attained by the proposed RRMA scheme.

"immersive vr environments, full body tracking and digital human models for ergonomic validation of maritime patrol aircraftâ€™s interiors","2023","In this paper, a human-centered design methodology is proposed to support the interiors design of a Maritime Patrol Aircraft (MPA). The combined use of Immersive Virtual Reality (VR) tools and Digital Human Models (DHMs) are exploited to include both objective and subjective measurements in the ergonomic evaluation process. The main issue consisted in defining the optimal ergonomic design configuration for Operator Console Area and Observer Window Area of MPAâ€™s digital mock-up, provided by Leonardo S.p.A. The methodology is based on a five-step iteration process: once having identified the requirements, required input data and the design variables, the ideated configuration is evaluated using DHMs in order to retrieve objective measurements (i.e., interferences, visibility, reachability); finally, a subjective assessment within immersive VR environment is conducted. A real-time RULA analysis is carried out on DHMs, calibrated on selected users representing specific percentages of target population, by means of a full-body tracking system. The subjective assessment in immersive VR allows to take into account also other human factors (i.e. human ability, dexterity and cognitive aspects) that have not been previously considered and may significatively influence the validation of the final design configuration of MPA interiors.","aircraft,maritime patrol aircrafts interiors,Virtual reality,RULA analysis,virtual reality,digital human models,objective measurements,Sociology,Ergonomics,immersive virtual reality tools,Solid modeling,human factors,Digital Human Modeling,human-centered design methodology,observer window area,cognitive aspects,immersive VR environments,Atmospheric modeling,Virtual Reality,Target tracking,operator console area,interiors design,full-body tracking system,ergonomic evaluation process,Ergonomic Validation,Real-time systems,Maritime Aircraft,ergonomics,observers,Digital Mock-up,DHMs,MPA interiors,subjective measurements,optimal ergonomic design configuration,iteration process,"
"robust infrared maritime target detection via anti-jitter spatialâ€“temporal trajectory consistency","2022","When detecting diverse infrared (IR) small maritime targets on complicated scenes, the existing methods get into trouble and unsatisfactory performance. The main reasons are as follows: 1) affected by target characteristics and ambient temperature and so on, both bright and dark targets may exist on IR maritime images in practical application and 2) spatial information and temporal correlation of targets are not fully excavated. To these problems, we propose a robust anti-jitter spatialâ€“temporal trajectory consistency (ASTTC) method, the main idea of which is to improve detection accuracy using single-frame detection followed by multi-frame decision. First, we innovatively design adaptive local gradient variation (ALGV) descriptor, which combines local dissimilarity measure with gradient magnitude distribution to enhance the local contrast for both bright and dark targets so that the suspected targets can be robustly extracted. For multi-frame decision, interframe displacement correction is necessary to eliminate the interference of IR imager motion and vibration for target codeword. We use pyramid optical flow to track feature point extracted by Shi-Tomasi to capture interframe registration coefficients. Then, the target position is corrected in the spatialâ€“temporal domain. Finally, a robust spatialâ€“temporal trajectory descriptor (STTD), which achieves target encoding and target trajectory consistency measurement, is designed to further confirm real targets and eliminate false targets. Experiments conducted on various real IR maritime image sequences demonstrate the applicability and robustness of ASTTC, which performs more satisfactorily than the existing methods in detection accuracy.","target characteristics,Pipelines,Optical imaging,ALGV descriptor,temporal correlation,robust spatial-temporal trajectory descriptor,image motion analysis,Feature extraction,gradient magnitude distribution,small-target detection,STTD,anti-jitter spatialâ€“temporal trajectory consistency (ASTTC),Adaptive local gradient variation (ALGV),Shi-Tomasi,robust infrared maritime target detection,multiframe decision,single-frame detection,robust anti-jitter spatial-temporal trajectory consistency,Target tracking,object detection,feature extraction,target encoding,IR imager motion,local dissimilarity measure,IR maritime image sequences,interframe registration capture,image registration,correlation methods,gradient methods,ASTTC,infrared imaging,Trajectory,image sequences,target trajectory consistency measurement,spatial information,Object detection,Adaptive optics,image capture,adaptive local gradient variation descriptor,"
"comparison of meteorological and satellite-based drought indices as yield predictors of spanish cereals","2019","In the context of global warming, as drought episodes become increasingly frequent, it is crucial to accurately measure the impacts of droughts on the overall performance of agrosystems. This study aims to compare the effectiveness of meteorological drought indices against satellite-based agronomical drought indices as crop yield explanatory factors in statistical models calibrated at a local scale. The analysis is conducted in Spain using a spatially detailed, 12-year (2003–2015) dataset on crop yields, including different types of cereals. Yields and drought indices were spatially aggregated at the agricultural district level. The Standardised Precipitation Index (SPI), computed at different temporal aggregation levels, and two satellite-based drought indices, the Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) and the Temperature Condition Index (TCI), were used to characterise the dynamics of drought severity conditions in the study area. Models resting on satellite-based indices showed higher performance in explaining yield levels as well as yield anomalies for all the crops evaluated. In particular, VCI/TCI models of winter wheat and barley were able to explain 70% and 40% of annual crop yield level and crop yield anomaly variability, respectively. We also observed gains in explanatory power when models for climate zones (instead of models at the national scale) were considered. All the results were cross-validated on subsamples of the whole dataset and on models fitted to individual agricultural districts and their predictive accuracy was assessed with a real-time forecasting exercise. Results from this study highlight the potential for including satellite-based drought indices in agricultural decision support systems (e.g. agricultural drought early warning systems, crop yield forecasting models or water resource management tools) complementing meteorological drought indices derived from precipitation grids.","NDVI,ESYRCE,Cereal yields,LST,Agricultural drought,InfoSequia,"
"lake sediments from southern norway capture holocene variations in flood seasonality","2022","Owing to the combined impact of human encroachment and global climate change, river flood hazards have increased around the world. Over the past decades, rapid warming has augmented atmospheric moisture fluxes. The resulting intensification of the hydrological cycle, as evident from instrumental records, is linked to more frequent and severe flooding. However, this observational baseline is too short to adequately assess long-term flood variability under different climate conditions. Geological archives can fill this critical knowledge gap by providing long-term (millennia) empirical constraints on the magnitude and frequency of floods. To reconstruct the frequency of flood events over the last >8000 years, this study investigated the Holocene lacustrine sediments from Lake Lygne in southwestern Norway. The precipitation in this area is sourced from the North Atlantic Ocean and transported by the prevalent westerly winds. As such, reconstructions of flood frequency variability may shed light on past moisture flux and flood generating weather systems in this part of northwestern Europe. We applied a multiproxy approach to robustly fingerprint the flood sediment signatures using multiple independent lines of evidence. This approach included analysing the sediments using X-ray fluorescence (XRF), computed tomography (CT scanning), and magnetic susceptibility (MS). We identified two types of event beds that differed significantly from background sedimentation throughout the sedimentary archive, which we interpreted as river flood deposits: one type is minerogenic and coarse silt-dominated; the other is a composite of minerogenic sediments and macrofossils. By comparing the sediment record with instrumental water discharge data from the last 100 years, we argue that these differing flood signals represent two flood regimes: rainfall-triggered floods during autumn and snowmelt-triggered floods during spring. Conducting a rate of change (RoC) analysis, we found significant millennial- and centennial-scale variability in the frequency of flood events. Moreover, comparing our findings with palaeoclimate reconstructions in the North Atlantic region, we found that the warmer than present early-mid-Holocene was dominated by extreme precipitation-triggered floods, shifting towards more snowmelt-triggered floods in the late Holocene.","Floods,Lake sediments,North Atlantic,Palaeoclimatology,Holocene,"

"atmospheric measurements of peroxyacetylnitrate (pan) in rural, south-east england: seasonal variations winter photochemistry and long-range transport","1984","Peroxyacetylnitrate (PAN) is an important secondary pollutant formed in the ambient atmosphere during photochemical episodes; it constitutes a significant component of the atmospheric NOx cycle. The behaviour of PAN in the atmosphere has been studied at Harwell, a rural site in south-east England, using a sensitive technique with a detection limit of < 30 ppt(v). Even during winter months, daytime levels of PAN above the detection limit were always present, demonstrating the ubiquity of this molecule in the atmosphere. Results for the periods November 1974–October 1975 and January 1980–June 1981 show the existence of a pronounced seasonal variation. Maximum levels were observed during summer months, and minimum values during winter. There is a large difference between these maxima and minima, in contrast to typical patterns for ozone, and it is suggested that PAN is a better indicator of overall chemical reactivity in the lower atmosphere. Simultaneous measurement of CFCl3, was found to be a good indicator of air mass quality and anthropogenic influence; increased levels of this tracer were always associated with elevated PAN concentrations. Unexpectedly high levels of PAN during two episodes in February 1981 showed the possibility of significant photochemical activity during winter months. Back-trajectory analysis for these periods, indicated the influence of mainland European emissions and subsequent transport of photochemically-aged air masses.

"footprints of fishing vessels in chinese waters based on automatic identification system data","2022","The importance and difficulty of large-scale quantitative analysis of fishing vessel footprints and fishing intensities with high resolution have received more and more attention and recognition in fishery research. In this study, a framework for identifying and analyzing fishing footprints and activities based on AIS data is proposed. The first step is the AIS data pre-processing. Through the screening and cleaning of AIS data, noise data such as non-fishing vessel trajectories are removed to retain only fishing vessel trajectories. The second step is the behavior detection of fishing vessels. Based on the proposed speed identification method, the trajectory of a fishing vessel is divided into three states: Fishing, stationary, and sailing. The third step is the calculation of fishing vessel activities. An adjacent point mean method is proposed to calculate the fishing time of each fishing point. In addition, two simple and efficient quantitative indicators, namely unit cell activity frequency (UCAF) and unit cell fishing time (UCFT), are proposed to quantify the activities of fishing vessels. The last step is the spatial and temporal analysis of fishing activities. The global Moran's index and Getis-Ord Gi* index are used to quantitatively describe the global spatio-temporal distribution and local spatio-temporal hotspots of fishing activities. Based on >130 million AIS data from 2015 to 2016, the footprints of fishing vessels in the waters of China's exclusive economic zone (EEZ) were analyzed and the 0.01° × 0.01° high-resolution fishing vessel activity distribution maps and fishing time distribution maps were generated. It is found that the footprints of fishing vessels in China's EEZ waters have a positive spatial correlation, and the areas with high fishing intensities are clustered in the coastal waters of Shandong Province, Zhejiang Province, Fujian Province and Guangdong Province. The research results can be used for fishing area identification, fishery policy making, and sustainable fisheries development.","Quantitative analysis,Spatio-temporal analysis,Fisheries management,Chinese fishery,Fishing activity,Trajectory analysis,"

"analysis of the convective activity and its synoptic background over croatia","2012","In this study, deep convective activity, identified by lightning measurements and associated favorable synoptic conditions, is analyzed. The focus was on the warm part of the year (April to October) during the period 2006–2009 over six sub-regions in Croatia. A convectively active day is defined as a day with at least ten lightning strikes over the target sub-region. The obtained dataset is used to determine the climatology of the frequency and regional distribution of convective days and their inter-month variability. The analysis shows that 56% of all examined days, i.e., every second day during the warm part of the year, are days with convective activity. The most convectively active sub-region is the North Adriatic, with 62.4% of all days in the analyzed sample. The areas eastward of 16°E exhibit a peak in convective activity in June, contrary to the more western sub-regions, which show a maximum later in the summer, from July to August. The average temporal characteristics, such as typical duration, onset and cessation of convection, are also estimated. In all sub-regions, the convective activity begins in the early afternoon and ends mostly in the evening. Nocturnal convection occurs more frequently along the Adriatic coast. In the second part of this study, the dominant large-scale weather types and upper-level flow regimes, corresponding to the convectively active days, were determined using surface and upper-levels pressure fields. The lightning flashes are frequently detected in the non-gradient pressure field (23%); in the center (18%), in the leading (15%) and in the rear (12%) parts of the cyclone; and in the front part of a trough (11%). The southwesterly upper-level flow represents the most common flow regime (38%) in the days with convective activity. Slightly less is the northeasterly flow, which occurs with a frequency of approximately 23%, and the northwesterly flow, with a frequency of 18% of all selected days.","Weather types,Convection,Lightning,Upper-level flow regimes,"
"extraction of fault component from abnormal sound in diesel engines using acoustic signals","2016","In this paper a method for extracting fault components from abnormal acoustic signals and automatically diagnosing diesel engine faults is presented. The method named dislocation superimposed method (DSM) is based on the improved random decrement technique (IRDT), differential function (DF) and correlation analysis (CA). The aim of DSM is to linearly superpose multiple segments of abnormal acoustic signals because of the waveform similarity of faulty components. The method uses sample points at the beginning of time when abnormal sound appears as the starting position for each segment. In this study, the abnormal sound belonged to shocking faulty type; thus, the starting position searching method based on gradient variance was adopted. The coefficient of similar degree between two same sized signals is presented. By comparing with a similar degree, the extracted fault component could be judged automatically. The results show that this method is capable of accurately extracting the fault component from abnormal acoustic signals induced by faulty shocking type and the extracted component can be used to identify the fault type.","Cross correlation,Auto-correlation,Dislocation superimposed method,Random decrement technique,Engine fault,"

This study uses the real-world historical ship automatic identification system (AIS) data from 2014 to 2017 to explore the flows of crude oil tanker trade between ports and construct a port-node global crude oil trade model. An analysis framework of “AIS data -> crude oil tanker trade flows -> port-node crude oil trade network -> port-node crude oil trade backbone network” is proposed to realize the progressive analysis of global marine crude oil trade.

Throughout the tropics (here 23.5∘ S to 23.5∘ N), they are under pressure from deforestation and poor land management which leads to loss of both forest area and species diversity, and reduces their capture of occult precipitation. Climate change may also reduce occult precipitation in TMCFs since the cloud base may lift in response to higher temperatures — the ‘lifting cloud-base hypothesis’. These threats to TMCFs are well understood, but their quantitative assessment is hampered by 1) uncertainty in the location and spatial extent of TMCFs and 2) limited availability of representative meteorological data. We use a Random Forest Classifier — informed by topographic data, MODIS vegetation data, TRMM precipitation data and ERA5-Land and MERRA-2 reanalysis products — to estimate the spatial distribution and extent of TMCFs (2.1 × 106 km2 ± 0.5 × 106 km2). We analyze temporal changes in climate, tree-cover and greenness of TMCFs over the past two to four decades to detect 1) multi-decadal trends, and 2) associations with the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD). Evidence for the ‘lifting cloud-base hypothesis’ in reanalysis products was inconsistent across the tropics; a lifting of the cloud base during the past four decades occurred for about 20% of TMCFs, predominantly in the Americas and a few locations in Africa, while in Asia a downward movement of the cloud base was found. However, these results in part depend on the bias correction applied to the reanalyses. Changes in TMCF tree cover and greenness varied by continent; in Africa in 50% of TMCFs tree cover declined, whereas TMCFs in the Americas and in Asia exhibited a net increase in tree cover, despite a reduction in tree cover in ~20% of these TMCFs. An important limitation of the tree-cover data is that they do not distinguish between natural tree cover and agro-forestry. ENSO signals were more strongly present in precipitation in American and Asian TMCFs, whereas IOD signals were stronger in TMCF temperature and dewpoint temperature across the tropics. ENSO and IOD signals were approximately equally important for precipitation in African TMCFs and in cloud-base height across the tropics. An arbitrary warming of 1 ∘C and a 100 m lifting of the cloud base, in accordance with the ‘lifting cloud hypothesis’, imposed on the Random Forest classifier showed a decline in the extent of TMCFs in the Americas and Africa, but an increase in Asia — mostly at the expense of evergreen broadleaf forests. The greater vulnerability of TMCFs in Africa may be linked to their more isolated and scattered distribution across the continent and drier conditions compared to a more continuous distribution and wetter conditions in the Americas and Asia.","IOD,ENSO,TRMM,Tropical Montane Cloud Forests,Reanalysis,MODIS,Climate change,Cloud-base height,"
"variability of multivariate wave climate in latin america and the caribbean","2013","Wave climate is highly variable on the world's coast and its temporal changes and extremes usually imply consequences like erosion or impacts to infrastructures. Alterations in wave climate were little addressed in the four IPCC reports although variations in wave climate may cause extensive coastal impacts. Changes are also often related to climate pattern variability. This variability as well as long-term trends has been an issue of research in recent years. In the region of Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) an understanding of wave climate and its variability is scant. In this paper we use an extensively calibrated and validated wave reanalysis to describe the wave climatology in the region at different time scales and for scalar and directional wave parameters. Long-term changes are identified in the wave heights and mean direction of the energy flux shows high spatial variability. Correlation patterns of the mean significant wave height and direction of mean energy flux lead to the detection of prominent modes of influence of several climate indices. A wave climate type approach is also used to identify wave variability along the region that allows an identification of different wave climate types in terms of wave parameters and occurrence frequency. In line with the results, the influence of El Niño events shows a higher frequency of occurrence of certain sea-states with respect to non ENSO years. We also explore how climate change affecting storm patterns may be translated into a modification of sea-state occurrence and therefore implying different consequences for coastal zones depending on local wave propagation.","Ocean waves,Inter-annual variability,Long-term trends,Wave direction,Seasonality,"

Formal concept analysis is a theory of data analysis which identifies conceptual structures among data sets. This method intends to make ontology building more efficient and allows for discovering necessity for new concepts and relations in an ontology, which leads to an ontology that has these entities described in a way suitable for knowledge exchange.","Semantics,Ontologies,ontology building,knowledge exchange,concept lattice,Thesauri,maritime domain,formal concept analysis,ontologies (artificial intelligence),Context,data analysis,marine systems,maritime ontology building,formal specification,ontology,Lattices,Force,Buildings,"
"13.10 glacial responses to climate change","2013","The response of glaciers to atmospheric warming has become a key issue in scientific as well as public and even political discussions about human impacts on the climate system. The predominant tendency of continued worldwide glacier shrinkage may indeed constitute one of the clearest indications in nature of rapid climate change at a global scale. More than a century of systematic and internationally coordinated observations provide quantitative documentation of this development and a basis for model developments in view of possible future scenarios. Mountain ranges at lower latitudes have lost large percentages of their glacier areas and volumes since the end of the Little Ice Age. Many of them may even become largely to even completely de-glaciated already during the coming decades. Such changes have the potential to profoundly affect environmental conditions in and around cold mountain chains. Sea-level rise, changing seasonality in water supply, and local formation of new lakes reflect changes in the water cycle at global, continental, and regional to local scales. They are accompanied by rather marked changes in landscape appearance, slope stability, erosion/sedimentation, and hazard conditions. The monitoring of glaciers itself faces difficult challenges of vanishing glaciers with long-term mass-balance observations. Modern techniques of spatial modeling increasingly help with integrated analysis of observed phenomena and early anticipation of possible developments.","Slope stability,Water cycle,High mountains,Runoff,Continental ice sheets,Sea level,Snow,Climate-system monitoring,Cryosphere,Climate change impacts,Permafrost,Glacier fluctuations,Sea ice,Lakes,Glacier inventories,"
"risk-based and predictive maintenance planning of engineering infrastructure: existing quantitative techniques and future directions","2022","Engineering infrastructure incorporate complex systems, hazardous materials and often operated by human beings, making them prone to catastrophic accidents. Continuously improving system safety of the facilities and their operations requires a well-established asset management practices. The history of hazardous events in some domains such as process facilities suggest that many accidents have occurred due to ineffective maintenance planning strategies. Thus, to ensure an acceptable level of system safety and availability, it is essential to adopt optimal programs and practical procedures in maintenance planning engineering assets. The lessons learnt from previous accidents have helped operators, classification societies and regulators to develop viable standards and guidelines for employing quantitative methods in Operation and Maintenance (O&M) planning. The current work aims to present the existing attempts and identify the gaps, needs, and challenges of maintenance planning in engineering facilities. It then integrates the empirical and theoretical conclusions, highlighting the capabilities and drawbacks of the state-of-the-arts and explaining research opportunities and challenges.

This work designs two different internal controllers based on the strategies mentioned above and relying on the dynamic model of the AUV. In addition, these controllers share the same external controller which is a non-linear PID relying on the cinematic model.

"anthropogenic emissions and space-borne observations of carbon monoxide over south asia","2016","The focus of this study is to understand anthropogenic emissions, spatiotemporal variability and trends of carbon monoxide (CO) over South Asia by using datasets from MACCity (Monitoring Atmospheric Composition and Climate, MACC and megaCITY – Zoom for the Environment, CityZEN), REAS (Regional Emission inventory in Asia), AIRS (Atmospheric Infrared Sounder) and SCIAMACHY (SCanning Imaging Absorption spectroMeter for Atmospheric CartograpHY). MACCity anthropogenic emissions show an overall increase of 16.5% during 2000–2010. Elevated levels of MACCity CO are found in Indo-Gangetic Basin (IGB), eastern mining region of India, Bangladesh and large urban areas. Some of the major contributors of these emissions have been identified as agricultural waste burning, land transport, industrial production, and energy generation and distribution. An area averaged mean value of AIRS CO at 600hPa is found to be 114±2ppbv (slope −0.48±0.2ppbvyr−1, y-intercept 117±1ppbv and r=0.68) with a minor declining trend at −0.41±0.18%yr−1 over the region during 2003–2015. A strong seasonality in AIRS CO concentration is observed with spring season peak in March 129±1.9ppbv, whereas low values have been observed in summer monsoon with sturdy dip in July 99.6±1.94ppbv.

"the role of the stratosphere in iberian peninsula rainfall: a preliminary approach in february","2007","This paper attempts to establish a connection between stratospheric anomalies in the North Pole and rainfall on the Iberian Peninsula through the occurrence of major midwinter warmings (MMWs) and cold events (CEs), taking February as a preliminary approach. We define the MMWs as the warmings which break down the polar vortex, whereas the CEs are the episodes in which the polar vortex remains cold and undisturbed. Both anomalies lead to a wind anomaly around the north polar stratosphere, which is connected with a shortly lagged tropospheric anomaly through a stratosphere–troposphere coupling in winter. A T-mode principal component analysis (PCA) was used as an objective pattern classification method for identifying the main daily surface-level pressure (SLP) patterns for February for the 1961–1990 reference period. Subsequently, those February months with an MMW or a CE influence in the troposphere are identified in the whole study period (1958–2000) by means of the Arctic Oscillation Index (AOI). Thus, performing the same analysis for the selected February months, new principal patterns for detecting changes in surface circulation structure and morphology are obtained. The results show a significant decrease in the westerlies and a southward shift of the storm tracks in Western Europe some weeks after an MMW occurrence, leading to an increase in precipitation in western Iberia and a slight decrease on the eastern Mediterranean fringe. The results are quite the opposite under a CE influence: the westerlies are strengthened and shifted northwards due to the displacement of the Atlantic anticyclone towards Central Europe; dry conditions are established throughout Iberia, except for the Mediterranean fringe, where precipitation shows a considerable increase due to the greater frequency of the northeasterly winds. Finally, an 11-year sunspot cycle–quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) modulation might be demonstrated in Iberian rainfall in February through the occurrence of these stratospheric anomalies.","Arctic Oscillation Index,Principal component analysis,Stratosphere–troposphere coupling,Circulation patterns,Major midwinter warming,Iberian rainfall,"

"structural health monitoring of harbor caissons using support vector machine and principal component analysis","2021","Harbor caissons are regarded as one of the most critical infrastructures, and any disruption in their operation would have dramatic economic consequences. The need for a health monitoring system for these structures is thus evident. The primary aim of this study is to develop a structural health monitoring (SHM) system to effectively detect damage in harbor caissons. To this end, through performing dynamic analysis, acceleration signals are extracted from the locations in the model corresponding to the presumed accelerometer's placement in an actual structure. Three levels of white Gaussian noises are added to the original signal to simulate the ambient noise. Using the acquired signals, the damage-sensitive features in both frequency and time domains are determined in the structure. In this study, leveraging Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Support Vector Machine (SVM), the damage-sensitive features associated with the damaged and undamaged structure are reduced in dimensionality and classified. Hence, the introduced system can assess the state of the structure based on the input signal from the accelerometer and detect possible damage and its severity. The effectiveness of the proposed system in detecting damage is shown using the numerical model of a real harbor caisson.","Support vector machine (SVM),Principal component analysis (PCA),Finite element (FE) modeling,Structural health monitoring,Autoregressive (AR) model,Machine learning,Harbor caissons,"
"changes of extreme precipitation in the philippines, projected from the cmip6 multi-model ensemble","2022","The Philippines is highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change including increased frequency of extreme weather events such as very heavy rainfall. Extreme rain events have resulted in landslides and floods, accompanied with a loss of life and the deterioration of infrastructure. To project the future changes of extreme precipitation in Philippines, we investigated the observations based on 53 stations and 24 CMIP6 (Coupled Model Inter-Comparison Project Phase 6) models. We applied generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution and multivariate bias-correction to series of annual maximum daily precipitation (AMP1) data acquired from the observations and models under three shared socioeconomic pathway (SSP) scenarios (SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5). We employed a model ensemble method that takes both independence and performance of model into account, which is named as the PI-weighting. To quantify the uncertainty of predicting the future AMP1, variance decomposition method was applied. Return values for 20-year and 50-year as well as the return periods of the AMP1 compared to the past (1975–2014), were estimated for two future time which are period 1 (2021–2060) and period 2 (2061–2100). From this study, we predict that the relative increases of 20-year return value of the AMP1 from the past to the year 2100 be about 8.5% in the SSP2-4.5, 11.6% in the SSP3-7.0, and 17% in the SSP5-8.5 scenarios, respectively, in the spatial median over the Philippines. We also found out that a 1-in-20 year (1-in-50 year) AMP1 observed in the past in the Philippines will likely become a 1-in-16 (1-in-37) year, a 1-in-17 (1-in-32) year, and a 1-in-14 (1-in-31) year event by 2100 under the SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 scenarios, respectively. We project that heavy rainfall will be more prominent in the northwestern and mid-western part (type I area) and the eastern coast part (type II area) of the Philippines.","Analysis of variance,Relative change,Expected waiting time,Method of L-moments estimation,Shape parameter,"

"a review of methods to study the fatigue life of nodes connecting marine composite hydrogen storage tanks to ships under the action of external forces","2023","The construction of hydrogen ships has emerged as the next area of research after the widespread usage of hydrogen storage tanks in fuel-cell vehicles. Marine hydrogen storage tanks are used differently than those used in the automobile industry because of the challenging sea conditions, which restrict their further use in ships. Current research is focused on finding ways to make marine hydrogen storage tanks stable and safe in these conditions. The use of hydrogen as a source of energy requires four main technologies: production, storage, transportation, and application. In this study, the fastening method for the hydrogen storage tank on the ship, node optimization, failure analysis, and real-time structural inspection of the connection node between the hydrogen storage tank and the ship are all covered. The failure processes and influencing variables of marine hydrogen storage tanks are distinct because in complex sea conditions, the fixed nodes of hydrogen storage tanks on ships are susceptible to hydrodynamic loads from waves and currents. The application of fiber optic nondestructive testing, digital twin technology, and intelligent sensing technology to the deteriorating performance and damage patterns of crucial ship connection nodes is covered in this study. It is anticipated that different technologies will combine to play a larger and larger role in the monitoring of ship life and the fatigue of hydrogen storage tank connecting nodes. The main challenges that marine hydrogen storage tanks face in complex sea conditions are summarized along with the current state of research. Suggestions are then made for the development of marine hydrogen storage tanks in the future, and a wide range of hydrogen energy applications are anticipated.","Optimal design,Impact failure,Digital twin technology,High pressure hydrogen storage tank,Intelligent sensing technology,Fatigue failure,Non-destructive testing technology,"
"k-means clustering algorithms: a comprehensive review, variants analysis, and advances in the era of big data","2023","Advances in recent techniques for scientific data collection in the era of big data allow for the systematic accumulation of large quantities of data at various data-capturing sites. Similarly, exponential growth in the development of different data analysis approaches has been reported in the literature, amongst which the K-means algorithm remains the most popular and straightforward clustering algorithm. The broad applicability of the algorithm in many clustering application areas can be attributed to its implementation simplicity and low computational complexity. However, the K-means algorithm has many challenges that negatively affect its clustering performance. In the algorithm’s initialization process, users must specify the number of clusters in a given dataset apriori while the initial cluster centers are randomly selected. Furthermore, the algorithm's performance is susceptible to the selection of this initial cluster and for large datasets, determining the optimal number of clusters to start with becomes complex and is a very challenging task. Moreover, the random selection of the initial cluster centers sometimes results in minimal local convergence due to its greedy nature. A further limitation is that certain data object features are used in determining their similarity by using the Euclidean distance metric as a similarity measure, but this limits the algorithm’s robustness in detecting other cluster shapes and poses a great challenge in detecting overlapping clusters. Many research efforts have been conducted and reported in literature with regard to improving the K-means algorithm’s performance and robustness. The current work presents an overview and taxonomy of the K-means clustering algorithm and its variants. The history of the K-means, current trends, open issues and challenges, and recommended future research perspectives are also discussed.","Clustering algorithm,Modified k-means,Perspectives on big data clustering,Improved k-means,Big data clustering,K-means,K-means variants,"
"maritime object segmentation using dynamic background modeling and shadow suppression","2016","Moving object segmentation in maritime domain is a challenging task due to the various real time practical problems, such as waves on the water surface, boat wakes and weather issues (such as bright sun, fog and heavy rain). These problems contribute to generate a highly dynamic background, gradual and sudden illumination changes, camera jitter, shadows and reflections that can provoke false detections. To deal with above issues, in this paper a fast and robust moving object segmentation method on a water surface for maritime surveillance using dynamic background modeling and shadow suppression (OSDBMSS) in the complex wavelet domain is proposed. For dynamic background modeling, we have used frame difference, background registration, background difference and background difference mask in the complex wavelet domain. For shadow detection and removal, we exploit the high frequency subband in the complex wavelet domain. A comparative analysis of the proposed method is presented both qualitatively and quantitatively with other standard methods available in the literature for publicly available datasets of videos in different maritime scenarios, with varying light and weather conditions. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method is performing better in comparison to other standard methods for all the test cases.","moving object segmentation,change and shadow detection,complex wavelet domain,dynamic background modeling,maritime video surveillance,"

The test was initially developed in laboratory conditions and later tested on elements of the roof structure of an 18th century building. In both cases the results were promising and mutually consistent with penetration depths for some treatments reaching 2.0cm. The application in situ proved the test’s viability and simplicity of execution giving a clear indication on the feasibility of possible re-treatments.","Penetration test,Wood,Old buildings,Treatments,"

"on the remote estimation of ulva prolifera areal coverage and biomass","2019","Since the outbreak of a large-scale Ulva prolifera bloom in the Yellow Sea during the Qingdao Olympic Sailing Competition in summer 2008, Ulva blooms have been a marine hazard every summer. Accurate and timely information on Ulva areal coverage and biomass is of critical importance for governmental responses, decision making, and field studies. Previous studies have shown that satellite remote sensing is the most effective method for this purpose, yet Ulva areal coverage has been estimated in different ways with significantly different results. The objective of this paper is to determine the lower and upper bounds (T0 and T1) of algae-containing pixels in Floating Algae Index images with an objective method that accurately estimates the Ulva areal coverage in individual images, and then converts coverage to biomass using a previously established conversion equation. First, a seawater background image, FAIsw, is constructed to determine T0, which varies for different algae patches. Then, T1 is determined from water tank and in situ measurements as well as radiative transfer simulations to account for different sensor configurations, solar/viewing geometry, and atmospheric conditions. Such determined T1 for MODIS 250-m resolution data is validated using concurrent and collocated 2-m resolution WorldView-2 data. Finally, Ulva areal coverage derived from MODIS data using this method are compared with those from the high-resolution data (OLI/Landsat, WFV/GaoFen-1), with a mean relative difference of 9.6%. Furthermore, an analysis of 17 same-day MODIS/Terra and MODIS/Aqua image pairs shows that large viewing angles, atmospheric turbidity, and sunglint can lead to an underestimation of Ulva coverage of up to 45% under extreme conditions.","Remote sensing,Biomass,Areal coverage,"

"water take-off and landing hybrid copter approach for maritime conops","2019","With the rise in the use of multi-vehicles teams, for maritime operations, new challenges and opportunities arise regarding the complexity and logistics of these scenarios. One way to cope with said complexity is to imbue some of these systems with the versatility of operating in more than one physical medium (air/water/land) during its normal mission cycle, maximizing their possible mission roles. The ability of having a vehicle which can operate both in the air and on the water can further expand and facilitate maritime operations by allowing new sampling, deployment and even communication scenarios. This work follows the iterations of a specific vehicle concept, through its various phases, and tracks the developments and challenges necessary to adapt a Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS) to become capable of water take-off & landing, and explores its applicability as a viable operational mobile communication gateway for underwater and surface assets.","internetworking,multi-robot systems,Switches,Stability analysis,maritime CONOPs,Payloads,multivehicles teams,operational mobile communication gateway,physical medium,aircraft communication,normal mission cycle,Sea surface,Gears,Complexity theory,remotely piloted aircraft systems,autonomous aerial vehicles,helicopters,mobile robots,water take-off and landing hybrid copter approach,Batteries,"
"grid size optimization for potential field based maritime anomaly detection","2014","This study focuses on improving the potential field based maritime data modeling method, developed to extract traffic patterns and detect anomalies, in a clear, understandable and informative way. The method's novelty lies in employing the concept of a potential field for AIS vessel tracking data abstraction and maritime traffic representation. Unlike the traditional maritime surveillance equipment, such as radar or GPS, the AIS system comprehensively represents the identity and properties of a vessel, as well as its behavior, thus preserving the effects of navigational decisions, based on the skills of experienced seamen. In the developed data modeling process, every vessel generates potential charges, which value represent the vessel's behavior, and drops the charges at locations it passes. Each AIS report is used to assign a potential charge at the reported vessel positions. The method derives three construction elements, which define, firstly, how charges are accumulated, secondly, how a charge decays over time, and thirdly, in what way the potential is distributed around the source charge. The collection of potential fields represents a model of normal behavior, and vessels not conforming to it are marked as anomalous. In the anomaly detection prototype system STRAND, the sensitivity of anomaly detection can be modified by setting a geographical coordinate grid precision to more dense or coarse. The objective of this study is to identify the optimal grid size for two different conditions – an open sea and a port area case. A noticeable shift can be observed between the results for the open sea and the port area. The plotted detection rates converge towards an optimal ratio for smaller grid sizes in the port area (60-200 meters), than in the open sea case (300-1000 meters). The effective outcome of the potential filed based anomaly detection is filtering out all vessels behaving normally and presenting a set of anomalies, for a subsequent incident analysis using STRAND as an information visualization tool.","maritime traffic,potential field,anomaly detection,AIS,"
"enterprise resilience of maritime container ports to pandemic and other emergent conditions","2020","Emergent and future conditions that influence the global container port industry include pandemics, regulations, markets, technologies, environments, organizations, energy resources, workforces, supply-chain partners, and others. It is critical to simultaneously formulate and adapt multiple strategic plans of individual ports to the above stressors. The Port of Virginia (POV) generates 400,000 jobs, or roughly 11% of jobs across Virginia, and has an overall annual economic impact of $92 billion. POV is currently investing $800 million to expand its annual container throughput capacity by 40 percent by the end of 2020. This investment supports initiatives outlined in the port's 2065 master plan through the investigation of different scenarios that impact emergent and future port conditions. This paper describes the most and least disruptive scenarios of emergent and future conditions, including hybrid scenarios involving the COVID-19 pandemic. The degree of disruption is measured by the changes in priorities of a port's strategic plan, in particular for the rank order of investments by their individual contributions to the strategic goals of the port. The analysis described herein includes sixteen strategic goals, 31 strategic plan investments, and several dozen emergent and future conditions. The analysis assembles the emergent conditions into scenarios. The most disruptive scenarios are selected for contingency planning, enterprise risk management, and research & development. Seven scenarios are available for future exploration in detail: (1) Funding Decrease (2) Natural Disaster (3) Green Technologies (4) Pandemic (5) Increased Automation (6) Alternative Financing (7) Population Changes. Green Technologies, Pandemic and Alternative Financing are explored in detail in this paper. The results of this paper are thus both a methodology for any port to address its emergent and future conditions via its strategic plans, and also a case study of enterprise resilience of a major container port of the United States. The results will be of interest to port owners and operators, risk managers, transportation agencies, regulators, freight shippers, human resource managers, the military, and others.","enterprise resilience,emergent conditions,COVID-19,maritime container port industry,strategic plans,investment,research and development management,contingency planning,economic impact,logistic systems,research & development,Port of Virginia,risk management,strategic planning,sea ports,COVID-19 pandemic,containers,risk analysis,industrial economics,environmental economics,enterprise risk management,Systems engineering,hybrid threats,strategic plan investments,"
"regional climate model simulations of extreme air temperature in greece. abnormal or common records in the future climate?","2015","The aim of this study is to analyze and quantify the future projections of heat waves in Greece. For this reason, specific climatic indices were used in the analysis concerning absolute, percentile and duration indices defined by the CCl/CLIVAR/JCOMM Expert Team (ET) on Climate Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI). The future projections (SRES A1B) of these indices such as summer days, tropical days, maximum daily maximum air temperature, warm days, tropical nights, maximum daily minimum air temperature, warm nights and warm spell duration were carried out using six regional climate models from the ENSEMBLES project, concerning the near future 2031–2050 and the far future 2071–2100 compared to the reference period 1961–1990. The ensemble means along with the inter-model-standard deviations of the examined extreme indices for the future model projections are presented and analyzed. Further, the findings of this analysis are discussed against recent recorded heat waves during 2007, in order to understand if such events are even more extreme or common in the future climate. It is very likely, that the anomalies observed in 2007, especially for extreme indices of minimum air temperature, could be more frequent considered as typical events by the end of the 21th century.","Heat waves,ENSEMBLES project,Greece,Regional climate models (RCMs),Extreme air temperature indices,"
"comparison of new technologies for data exchange in the maritime hf frequency band","2013","Recently, the use of HF radiotelex on ships, as the only terrestrial communication system for data exchange has been kept to a minimum, and the need for alternative systems, which would use the existing HF communication channels to exchange data between ships and end users on land, arose. Satellite communication systems represent the main aid for the exchange of large amounts of data with high transmission rates, but at high costs of equipment and services. Hence, there is the need to explore new, simpler and cheaper technologies for data exchange, which could be an alternative or a substitute for the existing radiotelex system. In this paper, a detailed analysis of the two systems, which could easily replace the existing maritime NBDP (Narrow-Band Direct Printing) telegraphy, has been done. One of the systems is based on the OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplex) protocol, while the other, on the PACTOR-III protocol. The systems were compared on the basis of the various relevant parameters, such as the modulation method, data rate, etc. The analysis results can be used in the selection of the optimal data exchange system with respect to the specific features of maritime communications.","narrow-band direct printing telegraphy,HF radiotelex system,Marine vehicles,data exchange,OFDM modulation,satellite communication,data communication,PACTOR-III protocol,ships,HF communication channels,orthogonal frequency division multiplex protocol,OFDM,protocols,maritime HF frequency band,NBDP,Bandwidth,terrestrial communication system,marine communication,telegraphy,maritime communications,Protocols,satellite communication systems,Frequency shift keying,"
"anomalous accumulation of acid-volatile sulphides (avs) in a coastal marine sediment, saguenay fjord, canada","1995","Sulphate reduction usually leads to the formation and accumulation of authigenic pyrite (FeS2) in organic-rich coastal marine sediments. Iron monosulphides (FeSx) are most often found as a minor constituent of the reduced sulphur pool in these sediments and are believed to be precursor phases which convert to pyrite during early diagenesis. Abnormally high ratios of acid-volatile sulphides (AVS) to pyrite, however, are found in the sediments of the Saguenay Fjord, Canada. The AVS-S:FeS2S ratio observed throughout the anoxic zone in three sediment cores collected along the main axis of the fjord generally exceeds 1 and reaches values as high as 7 at the head of the fjord. To document and explain this anomaly, solid phase components (AVS, FeS2, S0, reactive iron (FeHCl), CORG, and total N) as well as porewater constituents (SO4, Fe, and Mn) were analyzed. Degree of pyritization (DOP) values were low (0.1–11%) and generally decreased toward the mouth of the fjord. In contrast, degree of sulphidization (DOS) estimates were high and reached values of up to 43% at the head of the fjord. These latter values indicate that pyrite formation is not limited by iron availability but a large excess of reactive iron may in fact inhibit the build-up of reduced sulphur (ΣH2S) in the porewaters as a result of AVS-S precipitation. In the absence of a strong ΣH2S gradient, slow diffusion to the redox boundary and limited formation of soluble intermediate reduced sulphur species may hinder the conversion of AVS to pyrite.",""
"multi-hop wireless transmission for maritime scenarios","2023","The collection and processing of maritime information is an essential task that demands extensive analysis to achieve a more profound understanding of coastal regions. Usually, data is gathered through sensors placed on buoys and transmitted to onshore data centres for storage and examination. Nevertheless, the harsh marine environment, including waves, wind, and vessel traffic, creates substantial challenges for effectively managing this task. This paper focuses on two key objectives: firstly, introducing a physical model for electromagnetic propagation in a buoy network that takes into account the unique characteristics of the marine environment, and secondly, evaluating the performance of the physical model in a multi-hop data transmission scenario using a LoRaWAN mesh network. The main aim of the proposed approach is to facilitate efficient communication while optimising the utilisation of reconfigurable devices to reduce power consumption and accelerate data transmission. To gauge the effectiveness of the proposed solution, we explored a multi-hop approach centred on a single relay node that receives packets from other nodes and forwards them to the gateway. We analyse two quality-of-service parameters: throughput and packet losses. Our proposed solution indicates that employing a straightforward one-hop relay can enhance throughput up to three times during the transmission process.","onshore data centres,multihop wireless transmission,key objectives,Throughput,buoy network,physical model,Wireless sensor networks,one-hop relay,Sea measurements,Wireless communication,vessel traffic,maritime scenarios,multihop data transmission scenario,mesh network,transmission process,LoRaWAN,wireless sensor networks,electromagnetic propagation,Data models,simulation,LoRaWAN mesh network,multi-hop,Spread spectrum communication,substantial challenges,harsh marine environment,demands extensive analysis,maritime information,coastal regions,profound understanding,Sensors,multihop approach,buoys,wide area networks,Marine of Things (MoT),power consumption,"
"olive groves around the lake. a ten-thousand-year history of a cretan landscape (greece) reveals the dominant role of humans in making this mediterranean ecosystem","2021","The reconstruction of millennial-scale interactions between ecosystems and societies can provide unique and valuable references for understanding the creation of cultural landscapes and help elucidate their value, weaknesses and legacies. Among the most emblematic forms of Mediterranean land use, olive groves and pastoralism have occupied a prominent place. Therefore, it is vital to know when, how, and with what ecological consequences these practices were established and developed. Located in the southern part of the Aegean Sea, Crete is the largest island of Greece. The island is characterised by a long human history of land use, but our understanding of past environmental changes for the entire Holocene is fragmentary. This paper presents a new investigation of Lake Kournas in Crete, where recent coring provided a 15-m sequence covering ten millennia of land cover and land-use history. The study of this new core involves the analysis of the sediment dynamics, flood deposits, pollen, diatoms, fungal and algal remains, and microcharcoals. Results show that ecosystem development near Lake Kournas was not a linear process. They reveal linkages and feedbacks between vegetation, biodiversity, fire, human impact, erosion, and climate change. A possible human occupation and agro-pastoral activities around the lake may have been detected as early as 9500 cal BP, perhaps in a transitional phase between the Mesolithic and the Neolithic. At 8500 cal BP, climatic conditions may have promoted the expansion of the evergreen oak woodland. However, human impact was probably the most important driver of ecosystem change with the establishment of an agro-system after 8000 years ago. Thereafter, the trajectory of Kournas’ lake and catchment ecosystems from the Mid to Late Holocene follow the rhythm of land-use change. Among the traditional Mediterranean land uses, olive cultivation locally played a major role in the socio-ecosystem interactions, providing economic benefits but also destabilising soils. During the last six millennia, three main phases of olive cultivation occurred during the Final Neolithic-Minoan period, the Hellenistic-Roman-Byzantine (HRB) period and Modern times. Along with the changing land use under the successive political and economic influences rules, the resilience capacities of vegetation permitted it to shift back to higher biodiversity again after decreasing phases. Forest vegetation was always able to recover until the onset of the Venetian period (13th century), when woodlands were dramatically reduced. Only during the past century has forest vegetation slightly recovered, while the flood regime had already been altered during previous centuries. During the past 100 years, biodiversity markedly declined, probably in response to the industrialization of agriculture.","Olive grove,Land-use,Crete,Mediterranean,Paleoecology,Anthropisation,Human impacts,Holocene,Socio-ecosystem,Biodiversity,"
"vertical profile of aerosol characteristics including activation over a rain shadow region in india","2021","Unique airborne observations of aerosol size spectral and chemical characteristics over the peninsular Indian region are illustrated in this case study. Multimodal lognormal distributions were required to fit the observed in situ aerosol size distribution. The aerosol composition and mixing state was deduced from the single-particle analyses of aerosols using the transmission electron microscope and soot photometer coupled with satellite retrieved aerosol classification, and back trajectory analyses. Organic carbon was the most prominent aerosol type found at all altitudes. Refractory black carbon aerosols which constituted about 10–12% of the aerosols in the boundary layer were primarily internally mixed with both inorganic and organic coating. Other major aerosol types were dust and sea salt, with the latter primarily found below 2 km. Further, the cloud forming ability of in-situ aerosols is tested through a cloud condensation nuclei closure analysis. The effective hygroscopicity decreased above cloud base due to the absence of sea salt aerosols. The change in large-scale winds with altitude affected the aerosol composition and hygroscopicity. The multimodal aerosol size distribution and hygroscopicity parameter (κ = 0.18) obtained for the cloud base aerosols over the rain shadow region are useful for studying aerosol-cloud interactions using regional cloud-resolving models.","CCN closure,CAIPEEX,Solapur,Lognormal distribution,Hygroscopicity parameter,"
"data-driven assessment of the survivability and maintainability of offshore renewable energy devices in irelandâ€™s harsh maritime climate","2023","Unobstructed across the vast expanse of the North Atlantic Ocean, the Irish maritime area encompasses some of the worldâ€™s most energy-intensive waves.

Finding adequate weather windows for installation, operation, and maintenance activities is another obstacle when deploying these devices. This paper presents the results of a large-scale analysis of wave and wind data around the coasts of Ireland and Wales. Extreme Value Analysis calculates the expected wave heights and wind speeds for extreme events (1-year, 10-year, 50-year and 100-year return periods).

However, some of the essential data may be incomplete or unavailable. In order to recover or predict the missing information and best exploit the vessels monitoring data, this paper combines statistical analysis, data mining and neural network methods to propose a multi-task analysis and modelling framework for multi-source monitoring data of inland vessels. Specifically, an advanced neural network, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) was tailored and employed to tackle three important tasks, including vessel trajectory repair, engine speed modelling and fuel consumption prediction. The developed models have been validated using the real-life vessel monitoring data and shown to outperform some other widely used modelling methods. In addition, statistics and data technologies were employed for data extraction, classification and cleaning, and an algorithm was designed for identification of the vessel navigational state.","Trajectory repair,LSTM,Vessel monitoring,Fuel consumption,Multi-source data,Engine speed modelling,"
"multi-element and biomolecular analyses of soils as a means of sustainable site structure research on hunter–gatherer sites: a case study from the canadian arctic","2018","Analyses of large open-air spaces on northern hunter–gatherer sites face many difficulties. A central concern is that open-air tasks such as large scale animal processing may leave behind little or no macro evidence. Many tasks did, however, introduce chemical residues into underlying soils. Chemical surveys of these soils offer a minimally invasive, sustainable means of investigating large open-air spaces, which can provide evidence for the structured use of such spaces. Defining structuring in the use of space, in turn, contributes to clarifying site functions, seasonality, and residential mobility. Exemplifying this approach, we present results from ongoing soil chemistry studies at a 2000year old Taltheilei hunter–gatherer encampment in the Canadian Arctic. Samples were analyzed using X-ray florescence spectroscopy (XRF), inductively coupled plasma-mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Patterning in the data was highlighted using principal component analysis (PCA) and inverse distance weighted interpolation (IDW). Anomalous concentrations of CaO, MnO, P2O5, and Cu were discovered adjacent to dwellings, representing hearth cleaning episodes. Along with these, enrichments in K2O, MgO, Fe2O3, Sr, Sc, Y, Cr, Ni, and Pb provide support for the presence of open-air animal processing facilities. We have also identified several peaks in our FTIR spectra that reasonably indicate trans-fat derived from ruminant tissue. At this stage of research, anomalies are attributed to caribou processing and refuse disposal during late fall occupations. While we are hopeful that FTIR will continue to develop as a valuable means of identifying fats in archaeological contexts, additional work will strengthen our current argument for the presence of trans-fats in our samples.","XRF,Hunter–gatherers,Soil chemistry,Site structure,Sustainable archaeology,Canadian Arctic,FTIR,PCA,ICP-MS,IDW,"

"using nfts and blockchain for traceability and auctioning of shipping containers and cargo in maritime industry","2022","The maritime industry is a complex multi-tiered sector that plays a major role in international shipping and trade. Seaborne transportation is responsible for 90% of goods moved globally, and containerized shipments account for more than 50% of those goods. This volume of movement requires efficient tracking and traceability methods that secure the documentation process and ensure the involved stakeholders. However, due to its complexity, the maritime industry suffers from a lack of trust, lack of ownership evidence, protracted documentation procedures, and excessive data aggregation. These shortcomings are reflected in delays and elevated costs in the shipping process. To mitigate these problems, we propose in this paper a blockchain-based solution for the ownership history and traceability of shipping containers in the industry. Our solution utilizes smart contracts and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Ethereum blockchain to accelerate the inefficient shipping process by digitizing ownership transfer and process documentation. Furthermore, the proposed system allows the owners to auction off their cargo in the destination ports, freeing warehouses and containers in the process. We analyze our proposed system in terms of transaction costs and smart contract security. The smart contracts are developed using the Solidity language in the Remix IDE and the code is made publicly available on GitHub.","Seaports,Blockchains,NFTs,auctioning,Blockchain,Ethereum,Costs,Smart contracts,supply chain,maritime shipping,Documentation,Containers,shipping containers,Decentralized applications,Supply chains,"
"the effect of management practices on aircraft incidents","2020","Many models have been put forward in order to examine the human factors in aircraft accidents and incidents. Human Factors Analysis and Classification System (HFACS) which is the most widely used in literature is one of these models. HFACS is based on Reason's Swiss Cheese Model. The biggest disadvantage of the Reason's model is its post-accident applicability. Mostly HFACS aviation applications are usually based on accident data. This is a reagent (result-focused) approach. In this study, however, HFACS which is an improved version of Reason's model, was applied to aircraft incidents that did not result in an accident. This is a proactive approach. Thus, with this approach, the biggest disadvantage of Reason's model is turned into an advantage. In addition, a realistic application of this approach has been demonstrated in this study, focusing on aircraft incidents that took place between 2000 and 2018. The year 2000 forms a milestone in the manufacture of more technically advanced aircraft models which significantly reduced occurrence of technical errors in aircrafts, hence the choice of 2000 as base year. A total of 328 aircraft incident reports from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) database were studied and among these reports cockpit crew related incidents were analyzed using HFACS. As a result of the analyzes, the root causes of incidents have been identified. In addition, unlike traditional HFACS analysis, the relationship between errors occurred at management levels of HFACS and the unsafe acts of the cockpit crew in aircraft incidents was statistically revealed.","Aircraft incidents,Management,Proactive approach,HFACS,Human factors,"
"mapping and quantifying sargassum distribution and coverage in the central west atlantic using modis observations","2016","Sargassum washing ashore on the beaches of the Caribbean Islands since 2011 has caused problems for the local environments, tourism, and economies. Although preliminary results of Sargassum distributions in the nearby oceans have been obtained using measurements from the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS), MERIS stopped functioning in 2012, and detecting and quantifying Sargassum distributions still face technical challenges due to ambiguous pixels from clouds, cloud shadows, cloud adjacency effect, and large-scale image gradient. In this paper, a novel approach is developed to detect Sargassum presence and to quantify Sargassum coverage using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) alternative floating algae index (AFAI), which examines the red-edge reflectance of floating vegetation. This approach includes three basic steps: 1) classification of Sargassum-containing pixels through correction of large-scale gradient, masking clouds and cloud shadows, and removal of ambiguous pixels; 2) linear unmixing of Sargassum-containing pixels; and, 3) statistics of Sargassum area coverage in pre-defined grids at monthly, seasonal, and annual intervals. In the absence of direct field measurements to validate the results, limited observations from the Hyperspectral Imager for the Coastal Ocean (HICO) measurements and numerous local reports support the conclusion that the elevated AFAI signals are due to the presence of Sargassum instead of other floating materials, and various sensitivity analyses are used to quantify the uncertainties in the derived Sargassum area coverage. The approach was applied to MODIS observations between 2000 and 2015 over the Central West Atlantic (CWA) region (0–22°N, 63–38°W) to derive the spatial and temporal distribution patterns as well as the total area coverage of Sargassum. Results indicate that the first widespread Sargassum distribution event occurred in 2011, consistent with previous MERIS findings. Since 2011, only 2013 showed a minimal Sargassum coverage similar to the period of 2000 to 2010; all other years showed significantly more coverage. More alarmingly, the summer months of 2015 showed mean coverage of >2000km2, or about 4 times of the summer 2011 coverage and 20 times of the summer 2000 to 2010 coverage. Analysis of several environmental variables provided some hints on the reasons causing the inter-annual changes after 2010, yet further multi-disciplinary research (including in situ measurements) is required to understand such changes and long-term trends in Sargassum coverage.","FAI,Remote sensing,Surface fitting,Feature extraction,AFAI,MODIS,Cloud shadow,Cloud,"
"temperature and salinity trends in the northern limit of the canary current upwelling system","2023","Thermohaline time series are crucial for detecting and quantifying abiotic changes in the marine environment, and even more so in the present global change scenario. This is particularly relevant for the Ría the Vigo and its adjacent shelf, a highly productive ecosystem at the northern limit of the Canary Current Upwelling System (CanCUS). This study analyses a 34-year time series (1987–2020) of Conductivity-Temperature-Depth (CTD) casts, the longest series available to date in the region. Long-term trends, shifts, and seasonal variability of temperature and salinity were assessed and investigated in relation to regional meteorological variability and basin-scale atmospheric teleconnection indices. Generalized Additive Models (GAM) allowed us to determine that monthly thermohaline variability can be largely explained by regional meteo-climatic variability, mainly upwelling index and river discharge. Trends and shifts in some teleconnection patterns, especially the East Atlantic (EA) pattern, may also be related to both the shift in salinity in 2013 and its long-term decrease below 50 m depth. Despite the current global warming context, no statistically significant trend was observed for either the upwelling index or temperature. The spatial analysis of sea surface temperature trends suggests that our study area has been responding to climate change differently from other surrounding near-shore areas, as the Finisterre Cape or the southern Bay of Biscay. Overall, this study highlights the importance of long-term observations to elucidate the impact of climate change in the northern limit of the CanCUS and encourages caution when extrapolating conclusions from ecosystem studies on a regional scale.",""

We compared the distribution and variation of PCRI values over four time periods for the 35 port cities. The results show that the ports in West Asia, Africa and Europe are basically mature, and the changes of PCRI values are relatively small. The ports in Southeast Asia and South Asia are still in development stage, and the value of PCRI varies greatly. As the city develops, the dependence of city on the port will gradually decrease. The spatial relationship between the port and the city will generally evolve towards the marginal of the port formation (PCRI=0.6) and eventually remain convergent and stable. In the end, the effect of most ports on urban spatial structure will gradually stabilize.","separated port city,Urban areas,Spatial structure,Africa,port formation,spatial structure,centralized port city,Sea measurements,Maritime Silk Road,Port,Asia,port city development stage,urban spatial structure,economic development,Port city,Europe,Port-City Relationship Index,sea ports,marginal port city,Indexes,Roads,port city spatial relationship models,geotechnical structures,coastal areas,Earth,Market research,"
"long-term climate variability in continental subarctic canada: a 6200-year record derived from stable isotopes in peat","2010","The rapid warming of arctic regions during recent decades has been recorded by instrumental monitoring, but the natural climate variability in the past is still sparsely reconstructed across many areas. We have reconstructed past climate changes in subarctic west-central Canada. Stable carbon and oxygen isotope ratios (δ13C, δ18O) were derived from a single Sphagnum fuscum plant component; α-cellulose isolated from stems. Periods of warmer and cooler conditions identified in this region, described in terms of a “Mediaeval Climatic Anomaly” and “Little Ice Age” were registered in the temperature reconstruction based on the δ13C record. Some conclusions could be drawn about wet/dry shifts during the same time interval from the δ18O record, humification indices and the macrofossil analysis. The results were compared with other proxy data from the vicinity of the study area. The amplitude of the temperature change was similar to that in chironomid based reconstructions, showing c. 6.5±2.3°C variability in July temperatures during the past 6.2ka.","Subarctic,Climate reconstruction,Stable isotopes,"
"improving volcanic ash cloud detection by a robust satellite technique","2004","Automated and reliable satellite-based techniques are strongly required for volcanic ash cloud detection and tracking. In fact, volcanic ash clouds pose a serious hazard for air traffic and the synoptic (and possibly frequent) coverage offered by satellites can provide exciting opportunities for monitoring activities as well as for risk mitigation purposes. A new, AVHRR-based technique for improved automatic detection of volcanic clouds by means of multi-temporal analysis of historical, long-term satellite records has been recently proposed. The technique basically rests on the Robust AVHRR Techniques (RAT) approach, which is an innovative strategy of satellite data analysis, devoted to a former characterisation of the measured signal, in terms of expected value and natural variability and a further recognition of signal anomalies by an automatic, unsupervised change detection step. In this work, an extension of this method to nighttime observations is presented, by using thermal infrared information coming from AVHRR bands centred approximately at 3.5, 11.0 and 12.0 μm. Results achieved for two recent eruptive events of Mount Etna (occurred in May 2000 and in July 2001) seem to be encouraging, showing clear improvements in terms of ash detection sensitivity as well as in terms of false alarms reduction. The technique performance is also evaluated by comparison with the traditional “split-window” brightness temperature difference method; this exercise revealed a general improvement obtained by the proposed approach, even though some common problems still remain unsolved. The main merits of such an approach are its intrinsic self-adaptability to different environmental/natural/observational conditions and its natural exportability also to different satellite sensors. The results here presented show the benefits of such a technique especially when different observational conditions (time of pass, seasonal period, atmospheric moisture, solar illumination, volcanic cloud composition, satellite angles of view, etc.) are considered. The future prospects, also in terms of possible operational scenarios, coming from the implementation of such an approach on the new generation of satellite sensors (like, for example, SEVIRI aboard Meteosat Second Generation platform) are also discussed.","Volcanic monitoring from space,Mount Etna,Ash clouds detection/discrimination,Multi-temporal analyses,Robust AVHRR Techniques (RAT),AVHRR,"

"diatom evidence for mid-holocene peatland water-table variations and their possible link to solar forcing","2020","Peatlands located at the northern edge of the East Asian monsoon (EAM) are well placed to provide a terrestrial record of past climate and hydrological changes for this globally sensitive region. Here we present a middle to late Holocene, diatom-derived water-table records from a peatland in the Greater Hinggan Mountains, northeastern China. An age-depth model was achieved through AMS14C dating and Bayesian piece-wise linear accumulation modelling. The diatom-based water-table reconstructions show that the peatland water-table rose from 5100 to 3500 cal. yr BP, but fell approximately 3500 cal. yr BP. From about 2800 to 1500 cal. yr BP, the peatland water-table stabilized. After about 1500 cal. yr BP, several rapid hydrological shifts, which correspond with global climate anomalies such as ice-rafted debris (IRD) events, were registered in the reconstructed water-tables. Compared with other paleoclimate records in East Asia, the general trend of peatland water-table fluctuations follows the variations in the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) intensity. Spectrum analysis of the water-table profile yielded a statistically significant periodicity of 470-year that may be related to the “~500-year” inherent solar irradiation cycles. In addition, positive correlation between the peatland water-table levels and cosmic-isotope-reconstructed sunspot numbers underscores the role of the sun in regulating hydrological processes in the EASM margin area. The data suggest that the regional climate and hydrological variations at the EASM margin were first triggered by changes in solar output, but may have been amplified by interactions with oceanic and atmospheric circulations.","Peatland,Water-table,Solar irradiation,Holocene,East Asian monsoon margin area,"
"rainfall yield characteristics of electrical storm observed in the spanish basque country area during the period 1992–1996","2008","This paper is focused on the study of rainfall yield characteristics of electrical storms observed over the Northern Iberian Peninsula during 1992–1996. To this aim Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) method have been used. The SOM method is a group of artificial neural networks based on the topological properties of the human brain. Results clearly suggest that there exist three different meteorological patterns that are linked to the characteristics of electrical events found in the study area. In winter, most of the electrical events are formed under oceanic advection (NW air fluxes). On these cases, mean rainfall yield estimates reach values of 700 104 m3 per cloud to ground lightning flash (CG flash). During summer most frequent electrical storms are associated to local instability shooting by surface heating with advection of humidity coming from the Iberian Peninsula. Under these meteorological situations, rain is scarcer if compared with oceanic events but lightning CG counts reach the maximum values found in the area (about 10 CG counts per 20×20 km2 and day) giving this way the smallest rainfall yield with a mean value of 15 104 m3 per CG flash. Iberian air fluxes associated with cold air in upper parts of the atmosphere represent the third meteorological pattern found. This pattern is most common in spring and autumn but is not unusual in the rest of the seasons. In those cases mean rainfall yield in the area is about 150 104 m3 per CG flash. In all electrical episodes K instability index is greater than 15 °C but in the most lightning producing events, this index reaches in the area values greater than 24 °C. PCA results pointed out that there exists a relationship between rain and CG counts expressed by the first principal component computed from standardized data. However, we must notice that no event is solely linked to this axis, since a seasonal influence which decreases lightning production when rain increases is always present. Results found are of great interest for short term forecasting of flashfloods in mountainous areas like the Spanish Basque Country region.","Lightning–rain relationship,Applied physics,Northern Iberian Peninsula,Rainfall yield estimates,Fluid mechanics,Oceanic and continental lightning,"

All methods were firstly benchmarked on a 1500 simulated side-scan sonar images dataset. Precision-recall and processing time analysis was conducted in order to choose the best suited method in such controlled conditions. The performance of the best performing detection method was then validated on a 350 real side-scan sonar images dataset.

"how maritime education and training (met) instructors address assessment protocol","2020","With the advent of more technologies being utilized on a modern Ships Navigational Bridge it is important to address all human elements that play a role in the safety of the vessel. Of these elements, the training of personal in the use of the ships modern equipment is imperative. To address this, the maritime industry both on the international and national levels implements a series of assessments to validate a potential officer's knowledge base. This study looks to identify the Maritime Bridge Simulators instructor's interpretation of the assessments done on a Navigation simulator. An Auto Ethnographic approach is utilized to highlight current and previous interactions with the former Mariners, who are now educators. These Maritime Education and Training (MET) instructors, who utilize a modern Full Mission Bridge Simulator, as they assess a navigational bridge team will be examined. The preliminary understanding and projected findings is that both the performance based assessment and the interactive assessments done on these simulators, inform teaching and enhance learning experiences. However, the assessments themselves which are mandated, are vague and unsuccessful in properly assessing a future Maritime Officer. As Mariners have all experienced some subject matter experts who may have all of the qualifications needed to teach, yet are incapable of doing so. On the other hand, some may not have mastery of the subject but are able to pass on the knowledge needed for one to succeed sufficiently. In a worst-case scenario, there are those who â€œcan neither do nor teach.â€ How can we prevent these instances from offering? Is there something within mandated regulations that can be used to avoid this from occurring? Could there be a cultural or societal aspect that we can use as a preventative means? These questions are difficult to answer. There is a need to be judged on many levels, as well as discussed and debated. Instructors in the Maritime industry are no different than the Instructors in other fields. They have all been exposed to the subject that they are required to teach, how they prepare and interpret the lessons needed is not always the same as one would think. Simulation as an educational tool has been used across a broad spectrum of subjects and industries. How these simulations are integrated within the classroom differs depending on the simulator. One of the main objectives of simulation is Project-Based learning. Simulations that encompass the Project-Based Learning design can be defined as complex tasks based on difficult questions. These situations provoke the student to design, implement problem-solving, and decision making processes. The fact-finding activities embedded in the simulation can provide students with situations where they need to work independently over significant periods. At the end of the simulation, there is a concluding event that emulates realistic products or situations [1]. In addition to the â€œProjectâ€ associated with this theory, there are other defining factors; these factors include authentic content, authentic assessment, teacher facilitation, and clear educational goals[2]. All of these play a significant role within the realm of Maritime Simulation. For a successful Simulation of a Ships Navigational bridge to occur, the preliminary understanding and projected findings is that the performance-based assessment and the interactive assessments done on these simulators, inform teaching and enhance learning experiences. In order to accomplish this, many challenges are facing the educators that operate these simulated exercises. The first challenge is the Professional Development of the educators. Unlike most professional educators, the requirements to teach within this field are limited. The students that these instructors teach also differ in that they are an older student. This method is called Andragogy. The way the instructor approaches this must be different from the Petrological approach of young students. The final challenge addressed here is the instructor's interpretation of both international and national regulations. By utilizing Authentic Assessment, educators need to cultivate a better understanding of the concept or subject taught and focus less on the improved learning outcomes associated with them [3].","international regulations,interactive assessments,Project-Based Learning,human elements,project-based learning design,Regulation,Andragogy,assessment protocol,MET Instructors,Industries,Marine vehicles,modern ships navigational bridge,potential officer,maritime simulation,Bridges,Instructor Training,educational courses,preliminary understanding,Mariners,Maritime Simulation,ships,Authentic Assessment,navigational bridge team,marine engineering,clear educational goals,international levels,educational tool,Auto Ethnographic approach,computer based training,decision making,Professional Development,modern Full Mission Bridge Simulator,ships modern equipment,simulated exercises,teaching,Maritime Education and Training,performance-based assessment,MET,subject matter experts,Performance-based Assessment,future maritime officer,professional educators,maritime industry,Navigation,Task analysis,performance based assessment,Tools,authentic assessment,learning experiences,maritime education and training instructors,navigation simulator,maritime bridge simulators instructor,"
"maritime surveillance using spaceborne gnss-reflectometry: the role of the scattering configuration and receiving polarization channel","2018","Recent studies have analyzed the chance of exploiting Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS)-Reflectometry observables for maritime surveillance and sea target detection. In this paper, we provide a feasibility study of the ship detection problem using spaceborne GNSS-R data. The analysis is performed via the evaluation of the signal-to-noise-plus-clutter-ratio and signal-to-noise-ratio relevant to an isolated ship target in open sea. In particular, we investigated the impact of the GNSS-R acquisition geometry and radar signal polarization. The influence of sea state and ship orientation is assessed as well. The analysis is based on a sound theoretical electromagnetic model of the bistatic radar cross section of the ship target. The analysis clearly shows the benefits of 1) the backscattering configuration with respect to the conventional forward-scattering one and 2) the RHCP receiving channel w.r.t. the conventional LHCP one, used in sea surface analysis. However, the ship orientation and the sea state still play a key role in ship detectability.","marine radar,ship orientation,ship detection problem,ship detection,radar detection,radar clutter,spaceborne GNSS-Reflectometry,Marine vehicles,reflectometry,marine navigation,bistatic radar cross section,electromagnetic model,radar signal polarization,signal-to-noise-plus-clutter-ratio,ships,ship detectability,satellite navigation,bistatic radar,maritime surveillance,radar cross-sections,object detection,Sea surface,forward-scattering,Backscatter,backscattering geometry,backscattering configuration,sea target detection,Global Navigation Satellite Systems-Reflectometry,isolated ship target,sea surface analysis,Ocean temperature,spaceborne radar,Signal to noise ratio,RHCP receiving channel w.r.t,Spaceborne radar,spaceborne GNSS-R data,electromagnetic wave scattering,backscatter,GNSS-Reflectometry,Global navigation satellite system,electromagnetic wave polarisation,"
"monitoring of high biomass phaeocystis globosa blooms in the southern north sea by in situ and future spaceborne hyperspectral radiometry","2022","Phaeocystis globosa (P. globosa hereafter) is a phytoplankton species which commonly blooms at high biomass in April–May in the Southern North Sea and forms undesirable foam which accumulates on the beaches. Monitoring of this species is required by EU directives. Measurement of phytoplankton species composition has historically been made by pigment or microscopic analysis of water samples, which is spatially sparse and temporally infrequent e.g. weekly/monthly. In-water instruments such as flow cytometers can provide very high frequency data but at high acquisition and maintenance cost. Automated in situ above water radiometry has the potential to provide very high frequency data at single locations but requires very careful design of processing algorithms in turbid waters with high non-algal absorption. Spaceborne radiometry could provide both very good spatial coverage and moderate/high frequency of data, e.g. daily/weekly, but accurate determination of phytoplankton species composition is considerably more difficult in turbid waters than in open ocean waters. Prior studies based on a limited number of shipborne reflectance measurements suggested feasibility of P. globosa detection in turbid waters from hyperspectral radiometry. The availability of a new autonomous above water hyperspectral radiometer system has enabled further refinement and intensive testing of these techniques. From a time-series of 4356 water reflectance spectra measured near Ostend harbour in Belgian coastal waters from 2020/04/01 to 2020/08/18, two existing algorithms for P. globosa detection were successfully applied. Results show a high biomass P. globosa bloom occurring in late-April/early-May as found every year in water sample analyses for Belgian coastal waters. The high temporal resolution of the radiometric data allows to capture the evolution of the bloom at time scales sufficiently short (hourly and daily) compared to growth/decay and tidal processes. The challenges of extending the methods to future spaceborne instruments are also tested by simulating the impact of errors in sensor inter-band calibration, atmospheric correction and radiometric noise. Results show that because of their spectral coherence, atmospheric correction errors impact only slightly P. globosa detection whereas inaccuracy in inter-band calibration and radiometric noise are much more problematic as they affect each spectral band independently. Because radiometric noise should be reduced in the new generation of hyperspectral sensors and can always be reduced by spatial binning, the inter-band relative calibration uncertainty appears to be the main challenge for spaceborne mission design. Indeed, it was demonstrated that inter-band calibration error should be <0.25% and ideally 0.1% at top of the atmosphere highlighting the need for particular attention to inter-band calibration in sensor design and post processing treatments including vicarious calibration.","Belgian coastal zone,Inter-band calibration,PANTHYR,Signal to noise ratio,Autonomous measurements,Hyperspectral radiometry,Hyperspectral satellite sensors,"
"machine learning for shaft power prediction and analysis of fouling related performance deterioration","2021","Improving operational performance and reducing fuel consumption is increasingly important for shipping companies. Ship performance degrades over time due to hull and propeller fouling; therefore assessing when fouling effects are significant enough to warrant cleaning is critical. Advancements in onboard data logging systems, combined with machine learning techniques, unlock the potential to predict fouling effects accurately and determine when to clean. This study evaluates five models for shaft power prediction: Multiple Linear Regression, Decision Tree (AdaBoost), K – Nearest Neighbours, Artificial Neural Network and Random Forest. The importance of pre-processing is highlighted, contributing to the creation of a model with lower errors than previous studies. The significance of environmental parameters was explored, with the novel integration of wave statistics to the operational dataset, and simulated power-speed curves created from predictions to identify performance deterioration due to fouling. The Random Forest model was most effective in predicting shaft power, with an error of 1.17%. The addition of ‘Days Since Clean’ and ‘Significant Wave Height’ increased prediction accuracy by 0.07% and 0.12% respectively. Simulated power-speed curves revealed a 5.2% increase in shaft power due to fouling. This study provides operators with a method to determine when to conduct hull and propeller cleaning.","Shaft power,Random forest,Biofouling,Machine learning,Hull cleaning,Operational performance,"
"combining high temporal resolution whale distribution and vessel tracking data improves estimates of ship strike risk","2020","When assessing harmful human-wildlife interactions, researchers often attempt to calculate the risk that an interaction will occur. However, these analyses often quantify risk based on temporally static or spatially coarse measures of species distributions and human activity. As a result, risk estimates often do not reflect the dynamic nature of animal movement and anthropogenic uses of the environment. To illustrate the impacts of various temporal resolutions of data, we present a case study of blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus) ship strike risk in the U.S. Southern California Bight by combining predicted daily whale distributions with continuous vessel movement data. This represents the first effort to characterize blue whale ship strike risk by including the most recent high-resolution estimates of eastern Pacific blue whale distribution. We used these data to compare the ship strike risk models at varying temporal resolutions to address the effect of using coarser resolution input data. Our results show that it is critical to account for both dynamic patterns of human activity and species occurrences when assessing the risk of human-wildlife conflict. Analysis based on higher resolutions of potential interactions show greater variability in risk. Coarser resolution data mask variability in risk that may result from patchy conditions of blue whale habitat and/or variations in vessel traffic. We also demonstrate that coarser temporal resolutions lead to overestimations of risk. For highly mobile species subject to human-wildlife interactions such as blue whales, long-term environmental solutions depend on matching ecological data to human activity data at the most appropriate scale.","Marine megafauna,Ship strike,Human-wildlife conflict,Migratory species,Dynamic ocean management,Anthropogenic risk,"

Video systems are the most common and cost-effective way of observing behaviours in commercial aquaculture operations.

Results show that the system is capable of detecting fish shapes in video recordings and from these shapes quantifying changes in swimming speed and direction continuously throughout the day. Also variations between days were detected and these may have been associated with the daily shift in the tidal cycle. The system has the potential to act as an alarm to farm operators, informing them about unusual fish behaviours on a continuous, real-time basis. It also has potential to assist in the evaluation of fish welfare.","Fish behaviour,Fish tracking,Kalman filter,Salmon aquaculture,Video analysis,Computer vision,"

"a review of geohazards on the northern continental margin of the south china sea","2021","Crustal instability to induce the geohazards often results from both the internal tectonic dynamics and external sediment processes. Thus, the detailed geodynamics and kinematics of geohazards are important for understanding the tectonic evolutionary process and evaluating potential geohazards. This paper focuses on the active faults, submarine landslides, earthquakes as well as submarine canyons geomorphology description and kinetics explanation in the northern South China Sea (SCS) continental margin. Firstly, we have estimated the spatial extent, fault-plane geometry and faulting behaviors of the submarine active faults, such as the Littoral Fault Zone, based on cumulative deformation recorded by geophysical seismic reflections and geomorphic markers. We also analyzed the reactivation of preexisting structures, as well as the spatial and temporal distribution and migration of the submarine landslides and canyons. Then, several conceptual models and a comprehensive study of some of the different factors that contributed to the geohazard chain are conducted based on pre-existing theory and available literature. This review study indicates: (i) geohazards of different phases and geohazard chain are generally triggered by both early-phase tectonics-dominated and later-phase sedimentation-dominated processes; (ii) the fault geometric and stress segmentation may have played an important role in controlling on the uneven and asymmetric distribution of earthquakes and submarine canyons of the northern SCS, Especially, the ENE-striking preexisting Littoral Fault Zone is the major seismogenic structure along the Southchina coastline; (iii) the tectono-sedimentary coupling induced landslide and slope failure that has help to shape the modern coastal and slope geomorphology.","Landslides,Submarine canyon,Geohazard Chain,Sea level fluctuation,Littoral Fault Zone,South China Sea,"
"rainwater chemical composition at two sites in central mexico","2006","Chemical analyses were performed on rainwater samples collected at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) in Mexico City and at a wooded site, Rancho Viejo (RV) in the State of Mexico, for the periods 1994–2000 and 1994–1999, respectively. At UNAM, rainwater was collected for the entire rainy season period each year, while at RV, technical considerations limited collection to weekends only. The results showed large variations in rainwater chemical composition in most years, mainly because of the variability of meteorological conditions and also because of changes in source emissions. Sulfates and NH4+ showed higher annual volume-weighted mean concentrations (VWMC) in both sites. At UNAM, the maximum annual VWMC for SO42− occurred in March and the minimum in July and August. Lower concentrations of almost all ions were found at RV; however, the H+ concentration was higher at this site. The pH in Mexico City, calculated from the annual VWMC of H+, was 4.95, which is a little higher than pH values reported in some other countries. Despite the fact that sulfate and NO3− concentrations were lower at RV, the pH was lower. Air-mass back trajectories were calculated for individual concentrations of SO42−, H+, NH4+, Ca2+, and Mg2+, observed at each sampling site for weekend data. At RV, sulfate concentrations were higher when air-mass back trajectories indicated a wind flow from Mexico City and Toluca at 1000 MAGL (meters above ground level) and 3000 MAGL. The hydrogen ion exhibited the same behavior. Calcium and Mg2+ concentrations were also higher when the wind blew from urban areas at 1000 and 3000 MAGL. At UNAM, H+ concentration was lower and Ca2+ and Mg2+ were higher when wind blew from the northern sector of the city at 1000 and 3000 MAGL. In UNAM, the NO3−/SO42− and NH4+/SO42− ratios were 0.5 and 1.09 in 1994 and 0.86 and 1.64 in 2000, respectively, indicating a decrease in SO2 emissions resulting from the change of fuel oil to gas fuel. The SO42−/Ca2+ ratio was significantly lower at the UNAM site (1.82) compared to RV (5.36), and the SO42−/H+ ratio was significantly higher at the UNAM site (6.77) compared to RV (2.01). The Spearman's rho correlation between ionic concentrations indicated a positive correlation in most cases (p<0.05) for data from UNAM and RV. The multiple regression correlation analysis to predict H+ concentration in Mexico City showed that NO3−, NH4+, SO42−, and Ca2+ contributed 23.2%, 20.9%, 8.0%, and 6.1%, respectively, to the H+ prediction, while Cl− plus Na+ plus K+ only contributed 2.2%, and Mg2+ did not contribute. Sea-salt contribution to rainwater chemical composition was negligible with any wind direction at both levels. Excess sulfate (non-sea-salt sulfate) represented 98.7% of the total sulfate in rainwater collected during weekends at RV and 98.6% for weekend and annual rain samples at UNAM.","Central Mexico,Acidity in forests,Annual variations,Rainwater chemistry,"
"developing a framework for attribution analysis of urban pluvial flooding to human-induced climate impacts","2021","This study proposes a framework for the attribution analysis of urban flooding to historical anthropogenic climate impacts using real (historical) and counterfactual (natural) simulations from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) and Phase 6 (CMIP6) general circulation models (GCMs). A cluster analysis is implemented to select independent GCMs and to decrease the high computational time of the urban flood modeling. A two-step spatiotemporal statistical downscaling based on the generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution parameters is performed to meet the requirement of a fine-scale precipitation resolution for the urban flood simulations. Using the downscaled distribution parameters, the intensity–duration-frequency (IDF) curves and composite design storms for four return periods of 2, 10, 20 and 50 years are created to be used as the inputs of an InfoWorks ICM hydrodynamic model for a case study in Antwerp city, Belgium. The fraction of attributable risk (FAR) framework and the causal counterfactual probability theory are used to quantify anthropogenic climate influences on urban pluvial flooding. The results show that the GEV parameters of location and scale nicely follow the power relation, providing an opportunity for the temporal downscaling of precipitation extremes. A disagreement is found between the GCMs on the contribution of anthropogenic climate factors on pluvial flooding, some illustrating a higher probability of flooding due to anthropogenic climate impacts, and some a lower one. It can therefore be concluded that the urban flooding in Antwerp is not attributable to anthropogenic climate impacts.","Scaling relations,Fraction of attributable risk,CMIP6 GCMs,Urban flood,Generalized extreme value (GEV) parameters,Extreme precipitation,"

"data privacy protection for maritime mobile terminals","2021","Mobile edge computing (MEC) can effectively support various high reliability and low delay maritime applications, but security risks in computing tasks offloading exist. We describe a maritime network (MN) model based on MEC, and analyze the risk of data privacy leakage of maritime mobile terminal (MMT) during the offloading tasks. For abnormal maritime monitoring data (MMD), a data cleaning algorithm of sample density-based local outlier factor (SD-LOF) is proposed. It can effectively save the cost of data privacy protection (DPP) and improve the quality of MEC service. For data privacy leakage of MMT, an attribute sensitivity-based differential privacy (AS-DP) algorithm is proposed to balance security and availability of data and improve the differential privacy protection utility.

"adjacent channel interference from maritime earth station in motion to 5g mobile service","2018","Earth station in motion (ESIM) service is an advanced satellite service and its demand is increasing around the world. 5G mobile service (IMT-2020) is also one of the most demanding systems in the world. As ESIM uplink will operate in 27.5-29.5 GHz band that is contiguous to a candidate band for 5G mobile service, both services should be confirmed for the possibility of adjacent channel compatibility. In this paper, we propose methods to analyze the adjacent channel interference from maritime ESIM to 5G mobile service. Minimum coupling loss (MCL) and Monte Carlo (MC) methods are used to obtain the minimum separation distance and the adjacent channel interference ratio (ACIR) required for the adjacent channel compatibility, and the throughput loss of 5G up and downlink for given separation distance and ACIRs.

"analysis of limit setting rationales for protection of maritime vhf radio","2017","IEC 60533 is a product standard that puts strict requirements on all equipment on board of ships. Except for dedicated bridge equipment, there are hardly any products available that comply. One aspect from this standard is the low emission limit for radio frequency protection of the maritime very high frequency radio telephony system. This limit appears not to be based on a minimum range to receive a distress call, but on the possibility of receiving the lowest possible signal in an assumed placement of equipment. An analysis of the standard and a reconstruction of their rationale have led to an alternative, functional requirement with proper rationale, which can give the system integrator more flexibility in choosing equipment. This novel risk-based approach results in the same objective, i.e., an interference-free environment.

"profit margin prediction in sustainable road freight transportation using machine learning","2021","With the increasing transportation activities, road freight transportation has caused significant impacts on sustainability. The necessity of establishing sustainable road freight transportation plans have emerged for businesses. Therefore, it is important to develop decision support models that can be used by managers for sustainable road freight transportation. The objective of study is to predict the profit margin given to customers for freight trucking in sustainable road transportation. For this purpose, the variables affecting the profit margin to be given to the customers in sustainable road freight transportation are determined in the light of experts and managers. A data framework has been created using three-dimensional sustainability factors and customer-based variables. A machine learning-based methodology is developed. The scenario-based empirical investigation has been performed. Two different streams have been developed. The first stream is based on traditional importance analysis and second stream considers Recency, Frequency and Monetary based feature engineering and Discrete Wavelet Transform for noise reduction. Three different machine learning algorithms which are Random Forest, Robust Regression and XGBoost used for these two streams. Six different scenarios are considered. Finally, the proposed methodology is applied to two sustainable road freight transportation firms in Turkey. It is aimed to achieve the best performance for profit margin prediction analysis along with demonstrating that the proposed approach provides higher evaluation accuracy. The benchmarking results revealed the superiority of the proposed approach, which trained and tested the prediction model using the stream of data coming from a combination of Discrete Wavelet Transform and feature extraction. The benchmarking and comparisons enact that enhanced XGBoost algorithms provides the best prediction result. This paper presents a novel approach to predict customer-based profit margin in sustainable road freight transportation sector by combining different machine-learning methods for the first time. This study also provides useful insights about strategic and sustainable development perspectives to managers.","Sustainable road transportation,Feature engineering,Freight trucking in sustainable transportation,Machine learning,Profit margin prediction,"

"relations between climate change and mass movement: perspectives from the canadian cordillera and the european alps","2021","Earth's climate is warming and will continue to warm as the century progresses. High mountains and high latitudes are experiencing the greatest warming of all regions on Earth and also are some of the most sensitive areas to climate change, in part because ecosystems and natural processes in these areas are intimately linked to the cryosphere. Evidence is mounting that warming will further reduce permafrost and snow and ice cover in high mountains, which in turn will destabilize many slopes, alter sediment delivery to streams, and change subalpine and alpine ecosystems. This paper contributes to the continuing discussion of impacts of climate change on mountain environments by comparing and discussing processes and trends in the mountains of western Canada and the European Alps. We highlight the effects of physiography and climate on physical processes occurring in the two regions. Processes of interest include landslides and debris flows induced by glacier debuttressing, alpine permafrost thaw, changes in rainfall regime, formation and sudden drainage of glacier- and moraine-dammed lakes, ice avalanches, glacier surges, and large-scale sediment transfers due to rapid deglacierization. Our analysis points out the value of integrating observations and data from different areas of the world to better understand these processes and their impacts.","Cryosphere,Mass movement,European Alps,Canadian Cordillera,Climate change,"
"on the use of ipcc-class models to assess the impact of climate on living marine resources","2011","The study of climate impacts on Living Marine Resources (LMRs) has increased rapidly in recent years with the availability of climate model simulations contributed to the assessment reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Collaboration between climate and LMR scientists and shared understanding of critical challenges for such applications are essential for developing robust projections of climate impacts on LMRs. This paper assesses present approaches for generating projections of climate impacts on LMRs using IPCC-class climate models, recommends practices that should be followed for these applications, and identifies priority developments that could improve current projections. Understanding of the climate system and its representation within climate models has progressed to a point where many climate model outputs can now be used effectively to make LMR projections. However, uncertainty in climate model projections (particularly biases and inter-model spread at regional to local scales), coarse climate model resolution, and the uncertainty and potential complexity of the mechanisms underlying the response of LMRs to climate limit the robustness and precision of LMR projections. A variety of techniques including the analysis of multi-model ensembles, bias corrections, and statistical and dynamical downscaling can ameliorate some limitations, though the assumptions underlying these approaches and the sensitivity of results to their application must be assessed for each application. Developments in LMR science that could improve current projections of climate impacts on LMRs include improved understanding of the multi-scale mechanisms that link climate and LMRs and better representations of these mechanisms within more holistic LMR models. These developments require a strong baseline of field and laboratory observations including long time series and measurements over the broad range of spatial and temporal scales over which LMRs and climate interact. Priority developments for IPCC-class climate models include improved model accuracy (particularly at regional and local scales), inter-annual to decadal-scale predictions, and the continued development of earth system models capable of simulating the evolution of both the physical climate system and biosphere. Efforts to address these issues should occur in parallel and be informed by the continued application of existing climate and LMR models.",""
"assessing possible shifts in wildfire regimes under a changing climate in mountainous landscapes","2013","Climate change may affect the probability of extreme events such as wildfires. Although wildfires are some of the most important ecological processes in forest ecosystems, large-scale wildfires are often perceived as an environmental disaster. Since failure to include the dynamic nature of ecosystems in planning will inevitably lead to unexpected outcomes, we need to enhance our ability to cope with future extreme events coupled with climate change. This study presents several future scenarios in three different time periods for Canada’s Columbia Montane Cordillera Ecoprovince, which is prone to wildfires. These scenarios predict the probability of occurrence of widespread wildfires based on the hierarchical Bayesian model. The model was based on the relationships between wildfires and the Monthly Drought Code (MDC). The MDC is a generalized monthly version of the Daily Drought Code widely used across Canada by forest fire management agencies for monitoring of wildfire risk. To calculate future MDC values, we relied on different possible future conditions of climate, given by the Global Circulation Models. We found a regime shift in drought intensity with abrupt decreases in lightning-caused wildfire activity around 1940, suggesting that future wildfire risks can be inferred primarily from the summer drought code. For future periods, we found increasing trends in the probabilities of large-scale fires with time in most areas. It should be notable that, by the 2080s, there is a probability of some areas having more than 50% of large-scale wildfires under the “average” climatic conditions in the future, indicating that, even without “extreme” weather conditions, some ecosystems will have a fundamental probability of experiencing catastrophic fires under the condition of average summer. However, the rate of progression toward a fire-prone condition is quite different among the three climate change scenarios and among the region analyzed. Given such scenario-sensitive, spatially-heterogeneous patterns of wildfire probability in response to climate variability, management strategy should be flexible and more localized. By drawing on this knowledge, it may be possible to mitigate climate change impacts both before they arise and once they have occurred. These considerations are critical for maintaining the integrity of systems shaped by large-scale natural disturbances to increase their resilience to the changing climate while protecting human society and infrastructures. Working with alternative scenarios will facilitate our adaptation to climate change in managing fire-prone forest ecosystems.","Future climate and fire scenarios,Ecosystem-based management,Wildfire,Extreme drought,Natural disturbance,"
"situational awareness measurement in a simulation-based training framework for offshore well control operations","2019","Human factors are identified as the major contributor to oil and gas drilling and operations related accidents. One major limitation of the currently available simulation-based training programs is the lack of objective and validated measures for human factors and non-technical skills. These objective measures are necessary to evaluate the skills and training of drilling crews. Situational awareness (SA) describes the person's perception, comprehension, and prediction in dynamic environments. SA is critical in time-sensitive decision making, which may be especially pertinent for kick-detection and blowout mitigation. This paper presents the analyses of multiple objective SA measures in an immersive training environment. The SA for a sample of engineering-in-training students (n = 13) was measured using a well control incident simulator. The data analyses include knowledge tests, a voice log analysis, usability measures, check-lists compliance, pre/post performance surveys, and eye-tracking data. The results show that task knowledge (e.g. current pressure readings, current bit depth) was predictive of overall blowout mitigation performance. Further, the usability results provide some preliminary insights into task risk perceptions, task difficulty, and perceptions of communication. The results may help design an objective simulation-based training framework for human factors and non-technical skills measurement in oil and gas well control operations.","Simulation-based training,Well control,Situation awareness,"
"chapter 2 fasciola, lymnaeids and human fascioliasis, with a global overview on disease transmission, epidemiology, evolutionary genetics, molecular epidemiology and control","2009","Fascioliasis, caused by liver fluke species of the genus Fasciola, has always been well recognized because of its high veterinary impact but it has been among the most neglected diseases for decades with regard to human infection. However, the increasing importance of human fascioliasis worldwide has re‐launched interest in fascioliasis. From the 1990s, many new concepts have been developed regarding human fascioliasis and these have furnished a new baseline for the human disease that is very different to a simple extrapolation from fascioliasis in livestock. Studies have shown that human fascioliasis presents marked heterogeneity, including different epidemiological situations and transmission patterns in different endemic areas. This heterogeneity, added to the present emergence/re‐emergence of the disease both in humans and animals in many regions, confirms a worrying global scenario. The huge negative impact of fascioliasis on human communities demands rapid action. When analyzing how better to define control measures for endemic areas differing at such a level, it would be useful to have genetic markers that could distinguish each type of transmission pattern and epidemiological situation. Accordingly, this chapter covers aspects of aetiology, geographical distribution, epidemiology, transmission and control in order to obtain a solid baseline for the interpretation of future results. The origins and geographical spread of F. hepatica and F. gigantica in both the ruminant pre‐domestication times and the livestock post‐domestication period are analyzed. Paleontological, archaeological and historical records, as well as genetic data on recent dispersal of livestock species, are taken into account to establish an evolutionary framework for the two fasciolids across all continents. Emphasis is given to the distributional overlap of both species and the roles of transportation, transhumance and trade in the different overlap situations. Areas with only one Fasciola spp. are distinguished from local and zonal overlaps in areas where both fasciolids co‐exist. Genetic techniques applied to liver flukes in recent years that are useful to elucidate the genetic characteristics of the two fasciolids are reviewed. The intra‐specific and inter‐specific variabilities of ‘pure’ F. hepatica and ‘pure’ F. gigantica were ascertained by means of complete sequences of ribosomal deoxyribonucleic acid (rDNA) internal transcribed spacer (ITS)‐2 and ITS‐1 and mitochondrial deoxyribonucleic acid (mtDNA) cox1 and nad1 from areas with only one fasciolid species. Fasciolid sequences of the same markers scattered in the literature are reviewed. The definitive haplotypes established appear to fit the proposed global evolutionary scenario. Problems posed by fasciolid cross‐breeding, introgression and hybridization in overlap areas are analyzed. Nuclear rDNA appears to correlate with adult fluke characteristics and fasciolid/lymnaeid specificity, whereas mtDNA does not. However, flukes sometimes appear so intermediate that they cannot be ascribed to either F. hepatica‐like or F. gigantica‐like forms and snail specificity may be opposite to the one deduced from the adult morphotype. The phenotypic characteristics of adults and eggs of ‘pure’ F. hepatica and F. gigantica, as well as of intermediate forms in overlap areas, are compared, with emphasis on the definitive host influence on egg size in humans. Knowledge is sufficient to support F. hepatica and F. gigantica as two valid species, which recently diverged by adaptation to different pecoran and lymnaeid hosts in areas with differing environmental characteristics. Their phenotypic differences and ancient pre‐domestication origins involve a broad geographical area that largely exceeds the typical, more local scenarios known for sub‐species units. Phenomena such as abnormal ploidy and aspermic parthenogenesis in hybrids suggest that their separate evolution in pre‐domestication times allowed them to achieve almost total genetic isolation. Recent sequencing results suggest that present assumptions on fasciolid‐lymnaeid specificity might be wrong. The crucial role of lymnaeids in fascioliasis transmission, epidemiology and control was the reason for launching a worldwide lymnaeid molecular characterization initiative. This initiative has already furnished useful results on several continents. A standardized methodology for fasciolids and lymnaeids is proposed herein in order that future work is undertaken on a comparable basis. A complete understanding of molecular epidemiology is expected to help greatly in designing global actions and local interventions for control of fascioliasis.",""
"anomaly detection and assessment of pm10 functional data at several locations in the klang valley, malaysia","2015","In environmental data sets, the occurrence of a high concentration of an unusual pollutant, more formally known as an anomaly, may indicate air quality problems. Thus, a critical understanding of the behavior of anomalies is increasingly becoming very important for air pollution investigations. This study was conducted to detect anomalies in daily PM10 functional data, to investigate the patterns of behavior as well as to identify possible factors that determine PM10 anomalies at three selected air quality monitoring stations (Klang, Kuala Selangor and Petaling Jaya) in the Klang Valley, Malaysia. The statistical method employed to detect these anomalies consisted of a combination of the robust projection pursuit and the robust Mahalanobis distance methods using air quality data recorded from 2005 to 2010. Analysis of obtained anomalous PM10 profiles showed that data recorded during El Nino years (2005, 2006 and 2009) contained the highest frequency of anomalies. More frequent anomalies appeared during the southwest (SW) monsoon which occurs in the months of July and August as well as during the northeast (NE) monsoon in February. A lesser number of anomalies were also observed during weekends compared to weekdays. The weekend and monsoonal effect phenomena were shown to be significantly existent at all stations while wind speed was positively associated with extreme PM10 anomalies at the Klang and Petaling Jaya stations. In conclusion, anomalies detection was found useful for air pollution investigation in this study. The findings of this study imply that the location and background of a station, as well as wind speed, seasonal (monsoon) and weekdays-weekend variations play important role in influencing PM10 anomalies.","anomaly detection,air quality monitoring,PM,functional data,"
"maritime ship target imaging with gnss-based passive multistatic radar","2023","In the field of maritime surveillance, the global navigation satellite system (GNSS)-based passive radar has proven its potential for moving target detection (MTD), localization, and velocity estimation. The next stage is to investigate the possibility of obtaining the radar image of the moving ship for target recognition. However, the limited signal power budget of GNSS prevents the conventional inverse synthetic aperture radar technique that is based on target rotational motion and short observation time for GNSS-based passive radar imaging moving target. In this article, a two-stage imaging processing method relying on the target translational motion over a long observation time is proposed. The first stage confirms the presence of the target by a long-time MTD processing technique. In the second stage, based on the analysis of the Doppler history of the target signal in the slow-time domain, short-time Fourier transform and modified random sample consensus are combined to robustly estimate target velocity with reduced computation complexity. To obtain the focused bistatic image, azimuth compression is conducted by using the estimated target velocity. Finally, an image fusion operation is implemented to combine the bistatic images achievable from multiple satellites so that a multistatic image with high quality can be created. The effectiveness of the proposed method is confirmed by the real experimental results of three cargo ships illuminated by several satellites.","moving ship,Fourier transforms,inverse synthetic aperture radar technique,focused bistatic image,GNSS-based passive multistatic radar,short-time Fourier transform,target detection,passive radar,Marine vehicles,image fusion operation,short observation time,long observation time,maritime ship target imaging,cargo ships,image fusion,target velocity estimation,ships,satellite navigation,maritime surveillance,estimated target velocity,two-stage imaging processing method,object detection,passive radar imaging,synthetic aperture radar,bistatic images,target rotational motion,radar imaging,Doppler effect,Radar,target translational motion,velocity estimation,Global navigation satellite system (GNSS)-based passive radar,Passive radar,Radar imaging,GNSS-based passive radar,target signal,Imaging,long-time MTD processing technique,slow-time domain,radar image,target recognition,multistatic image,Global navigation satellite system,global navigation satellite system-based passive radar,"
"ship classification based on ship behavior clustering from ais data","2019","Since the introduction of the Automatic Identification System (AIS), AIS data has proven to be a valuable source of ship behavior analysis using data mining. It records ship position, speed and other behavior attributes at specific time intervals in all voyages at sea and in ports. However, the current studies in ship behavior analyze the behavior patterns either with a subjective choice of classification for behavior differences among the groups of ships or without any classification at all. In order to fill this gap, a new methodology for ship classification in ports based on behavior clustering is developed by analyzing AIS data from the port of Rotterdam. Besides a proper data preparation, the proposed methodology consists of two steps: step I, clustering ship behavior in a port area and identifying the characteristics of the clusters; step II, classifying ships to such behavior clusters based on the ship characteristics. The clustering results present both the behavior patterns and the behavior change patterns for ship path and speed over ground, which are the dominant behavior attributes for ships in ports. Some patterns of integral ship behavior can also be revealed by investigating the correlation between the two behavior attributes. Our research has shown that length and beam can be adopted as explanatory variable to classify ships to the corresponding behavior clusters. The classifiers are developed based on both unsupervised discretization (equal width binning) and supervised discretization (Chi2). The performances of classifiers are compared by three evaluation metrics, including Average Accuracy, F1score, and AUC. We found that the classification based on multi-criteria is more accurate than using a single criterion. The classifications based on Chi2 discretization outperform the ones with equal width discretization. The outcome leads to a systematic understanding of ship behavior in a port area and can be used to predict the ship behavior pattern based on their characteristics and simulate the ship behavior.","Ship classification,Ports and waterways,Behavior clustering,Data mining,AIS data,"
"multivessel computation offloading in maritime mobile edge computing network","2019","With the development of the maritime networks, the data of vessel users is growing exponentially, and more and more resource intensive tasks, such as multimedia applications, high-definition video playback and games, appear in the daily demands. These changes have greatly increased the energy consumption and bandwidth requirements of vessel terminals and networks. In order to meet the requirements of high bandwidth and low delay for the high-speed development of mobile network, and reduce the network load, the concept of mobile edge computing (MEC) is proposed and has been widely supported by the academia and industry. It is considered to be one of the key technologies of the next generation networks. Inspired by this idea, this paper introduces computing offloading technology to maritime mobile cloud networks. Maritime mobile cloud network is the product of the continuous development of cloud computing technology and mobile Internet technology. In this paper, we studied the issue of computation task offloading for vessel terminals, focusing on minimizing the energy consumption of vessel terminals and the execution delay of computation task. First, it determines that whether if it should be offloaded to the cloud server. Second, the server should be selected to run the computation task. The goal of the optimization is to minimize the energy consumption of vessel terminals and the execution delay of computation task taking into account of different weights. To reduce the execution latency and device energy consumption, we proposed a multivessel computation offloading algorithm based on improved Hungarian algorithm in maritime MEC network.

Two multi-institutional, multi-instrument campaigns, one under ‘Space Weather: Science and Applications’ and the other emphasizing tides under ‘Atmospheric Coupling Processes’ were conducted during February–April 2006. The highlights of the campaigns include improved prediction of equatorial spread-F (ESF) based on a ‘new factor’ combining the strength and asymmetry of the equatorial ionization anomaly (EIA); simultaneous detection of quasi-2-day wave at both E and F region heights; tomographic image showing a Traveling Ionospheric Disturbance (TID) in association with a counter electrojet (CEJ) event—all highlighting the neutral and electrodynamical coupling of the equatorial ionosphere−thermosphere regions; an unusual lowering of mesospheric temperature during a moderate geomagnetic storm—highlighting a new space weather effect; diurnal tide showing a peak amplitude of 35m/s at 45km in zonal wind and a significantly lower amplitude (∼15m/s) in the meridional wind and also evidence of convective activity in the lower atmosphere influencing the tidal variability in the Mesosphere−Lower Thermosphere (MLT) region highlighting the vertical coupling of the atmospheric regions. The development of models for equatorial and low latitude ionosphere has been among the prime activities taken up under ‘Space Climate’. Two models have been developed towards this end: one based on Second Degree (SD) relationships of F region parameters to the mean sun spot number and the other a Multiple Regression Analysis (MRA) based model involving expressions relating F region parameters to that representing solar and geomagnetic activities. The two models, intended for long and short term predictions, have been found to represent the equatorial and low latitude ionosphere over Indian longitudes better than the commonly used International Reference Ionosphere (IRI).

"a tale of sea and sky on the security of maritime vsat communications","2020","Very Small Aperture Terminals (VSAT) have revolutionized maritime operations. However, the security dimensions of maritime VSAT services are not well understood. Historically, high equipment costs have acted as a barrier to entry for both researchers and attackers. In this paper we demonstrate a substantial change in threat model, proving practical attacks against maritime VSAT networks with less than $400 of widely-available television equipment. This is achieved through GSExtract, a purpose-built forensic tool which enables the extraction of IP traffic from highly corrupted VSAT data streams.The implications of this threat are assessed experimentally through the analysis of more than 1.3 TB of real-world maritime VSAT recordings encompassing 26 million square kilometers of coverage area. The underlying network platform employed in these systems is representative of more than 60% of the global maritime VSAT services market. We find that sensitive data belonging to some of the world's largest maritime companies is regularly leaked over VSAT ship-to-shore communications. This threat is contextualized through illustrative case studies ranging from the interception and alteration of navigational charts to theft of passport and credit card details. Beyond this, we demonstrate the ability to arbitrarily intercept and modify TCP sessions under certain network configurations, enabling man-in-the-middle and denial of service attacks against ships at sea. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of the unique requirements and challenges for encryption in VSAT environments.","Satellites,VSAT networks,computer network security,high equipment costs,global maritime VSAT services market,Industries,Marine vehicles,Companies,transport protocols,widely-available television equipment,maritime VSAT communications,cryptography,ships,purpose-built forensic tool,man-in-the-middle attacks,denial of service attacks,highly corrupted VSAT data streams,sensitive data,Broadband communication,threat model,practical attacks,satellite ground stations,IP traffic,Satellite broadcasting,VSAT ship-to-shore communications,telecommunication traffic,network configurations,real-world maritime VSAT recordings,VSAT environments,Aperture Terminals,marine communication,maritime operations,Security,security dimensions,"

"improved kinematic interpolation for ais trajectory reconstruction","2021","Ship trajectory information has made a significant contribution to the data-based research in analyzing maritime transportation and has facilitated the improvement of maritime safety. However, the AIS data, which consists of ship trajectory, inevitably contains noises or missing data that can interfere with the conclusion. In this paper, an improved kinematic interpolation is presented for AIS trajectory reconstruction, which integrates data preprocessing and interpolation that considers the ships' kinematic information. The improved kinematic reconstruction method includes four steps: (1) data preprocessing, (2) analysis of time interval distribution, (3) abnormal data detection and removal, (4) kinematic interpolation that takes the kinematic feature of ships (i.e., velocity and acceleration) into account, adding forward and backward track points to help correct the acceleration function of reconstruction points. The proposed method is tested on the AIS dataset of Zhoushan Port and was compared with traditional ship trajectory reconstruction methods. The comparison indicates that the proposed method can effectively reconstruct the ship trajectory with higher performance on a single ship trajectory and a large AIS data set of certain water areas.","Trajectory reconstruction,Ship trajectory,Kinematic interpolation,AIS,"
"discovering maritime traffic route from ais network","2016","The recent build-up network of Automatic Identification System (AIS) equipped on vessels provides a rich source of vessel movement information. AIS is originally designed for automatically exchanging navigation information, such as their unique identification, position, course, and speed, with nearby vessels and terrestrial receivers to affect collision avoidance and safety control. The collected sequences of AIS logs can be considered as maritime trajectory data, i.e., the sequences of location points with timestamps. This vast amount of AIS trajectory data can be collected and employed to achieve an awareness of maritime traffic knowledge. This paper is devoted to discovery of maritime traffic route from trajectory data generated by AIS networks. However, AIS trajectory data discovery is a challenging task because of the trajectory data is available with uncertainty. Furthermore, unlike the vehicles' movements are constrained by road networks, there is no such a sea route for vessels to follow in marine areas. To overcome the challenges, we propose a framework of Maritime Traffic Route Discovery (abbreviated as MTRD) to generate pattern-aware routes to achieve an effective understanding of maritime traffic awareness. The proposed framework is evaluated on real AIS data and the experimental results shows that the proposed MTRD is able to extract the marine traffic route effectively and provides a cornerstone of maritime traffic knowledge for traffic management, anomaly detection, and conflict analysis in the future.","data mining,MTRD,AIS trajectory data discovery,terrestrial receivers,anomaly detection,AIS logs,traffic management,marine navigation,Global Positioning System,vessel movement information,Trajectory pattern mining,Trajectory data,Electronic mail,AIS network,maritime traffic knowledge,automatic identification system,marine safety,location point sequences,maritime trajectory data,Artificial intelligence,safety control,vehicle movements,maritime traffic route discovery,Roads,Trajectory,Uncertainty,traffic engineering computing,AIS trajectory data,AIS System,Maritime Traffic knowledge,automatic navigation information exchange,collision avoidance,conflict analysis,Data mining,maritime traffic awareness,Traffic Route Discovery,"

The purpose of our work was to test some moving target detection techniques inspired by the state-of-the-art on a specific dataset of interest.

The dataset was collected under real operational conditions during a recent experimental activity. The frames in the dataset are characterized by heterogeneous backgrounds and different targets covering a wide range of sizes and speeds. To evaluate the performance, the ground truth has been manually labeled through direct observation in 4706 frames. All the examined techniques are used to estimate the background. They are preceded by a frame-based z-normalization. After the background estimation, the absolute difference with the normalized frame is computed to highlight both hot and cold targets. Once highlighted, the targets can be separated from the background with a threshold. Then, morphological operations both in time and space are executed to delete small and brief false alarms.

"information fusion and tracking using bernoulli filters for maritime surveillance","2022","This paper concerns the application of information fusion and Bernoulli filtering to a maritime surveillance scenario. Sensor data was recorded during live trials featuring a static Leonardo Osprey maritime surveillance active electronic scan array (AESA) radar observing a cooperative rigid inflatable boat (RIB) target deployed in the Firth of Forth estuary north of Edinburgh, UK. The RIB was equipped with a global positioning system (GPS) and an automatic identification system (AIS) recording geodetic position over time, where the collected data is fused to generate ground truth. A multi-target joint detection and tracking (MTJDT) algorithm is used to both detect and track the RIB target from post-processed radar and AIS data whilst ignoring other information regarding objects and sources of interference. Generalised optimal sub-pattern assignment (GOSPA) and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis are used to evaluate target detection, localisation, and cardinality performance quantification. Results suggest conventional data processing and the proposed tracking algorithm achieve reasonable detection and tracking performance under the assumption that the ground truth well-represents the RIB position without knowledge of error statistics, but track divergence and discontinuities occur due to radar obscuration by buildings, data inaccuracies and clutter.","maritime surveillance scenario,sensor fusion,marine radar,reasonable detection,geodetic position,multitarget joint detection,target detection,Global Positioning System,information fusion,information regarding objects,target tracking,global positioning system,image fusion,sensor data,automatic identification system,data inaccuracies,filtering theory,boats,RIB target,static Leonardo Osprey maritime surveillance active electronic scan array radar,object detection,radar interference,video recording,radar imaging,radar receivers,bernoulli filters,conventional data processing,radar tracking,clutter,radar obscuration,post processed radar,rigid inflatable boat target,video surveillance,track divergence,RIB position,AIS data,"

"application scenarios of nautical ad-hoc network for maritime communications","2009","In terrestrial wireless communications, high data-rate transmission can be readily achieved by installing base stations on the ground. However, the same system may not be adapted to maritime communication due to the geographically restricted nature of the sea, and therefore, MF/HF modems, capable of long-distance transmission, with low data-rate are frequently employed in maritime communication. Maritime satellite communication through Inmarsat is conventionally used to compensate for the low data-rate transmission of MF/HF modems, but its high cost still remains as a main drawback. In order to enhance the transmission speed with a fairly low price, in general, a network whose architecture is similar to Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (VANET), that allows peer-to-peer communications without base stations, i.e., ad-hoc network, is crucial. Herein, we propose an ad-hoc network for nautical environment, which is named as Nautical Ad-hoc Network (NANET).

"a trajectory clustering method based on douglas-peucker compression and density for marine traffic pattern recognition","2019","Clustering analysis is applied extensively in pattern recognition. In marine traffic applications, the clustering results may exhibit a customary route and traffic volume distribution. In order to improve the clustering performance of ship trajectory data, which is characterized by a large data volume and distribution complexity, a method consisting of Douglas-Peucker (DP)-based compression and density-based clustering is proposed. In the first part of the proposed method, the appropriate parameters for the DP algorithm were determined according to the shape changes in the trajectories, which were used to compress the trajectories prior to calculating the dynamic time warping (DTW) distance matrix. In the second part, the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm was improved in terms of determining the parameters. Based on the statistical characteristics of ship trajectory distribution, the appropriate DBSCAN parameters could be determined adaptively. Evaluation and comparison experiments were conducted based on massive real ship trajectories in the Chinese port of Beilun-Zhoushan. The results demonstrated that, compared to the traditional DTW distance, the proposed similarity measurement exhibits superior performance in terms of both time and quality. Furthermore, the results of the comparison experiment demonstrated that the improved DBSCAN outperforms two existing clustering methods in marine traffic c pattern recognition.","Ship trajectory clustering,Douglas–peucker algorithm,DTW,DBSCAN,"
"unsupervised maritime vessel re-identification with multi-level contrastive learning","2023","Re-identification (re-ID) of maritime vessels plays an important role in marine surveillance, but remains highly unexplored due to the lack of large-scale annotated datasets. In vessel re-ID, contrastive methods are supposed to learn discriminative representation from unlabeled vessel images in an unsupervised manner. However, directly introducing classical instance-level contrastive methods to maritime vessel re-ID suffers from the difficulty of finding vessel images with the same pseudo label as positive images, which potentially leads to inefficient training and unsatisfactory performance. This paper proposes a simple but effective method to solve such a hard positive problem. Our method takes all images in an intra-batch cluster as positives and excludes them from the set of negative samples when computing instance-level contrastive loss. Based on this strategy, we construct a multi-level contrastive learning (MCL) framework for vessel re-ID trained with the specifically designed intra-batch cluster-level contrastive loss along with the instance-level one. Experiments on a newly proposed dataset consisting of 1,248 vessel identities show that MCL achieves the state-of-the-art performance compared with other unsupervised methods.","object recognition,discriminative representation,unsupervised learning,Cameras,Unsupervised learning,Vessel re-identification,instance-level contrastive loss,contrastive learning,intra-batch cluster-level contrastive loss,image representation,MCL,Intelligent transportation systems,unsupervised maritime vessel re-identification,pattern clustering,multilevel contrastive learning,maritime vessel re-ID,vessel identities,Training,large-scale annotated datasets,Representation learning,positive images,unlabeled vessel images,Surveillance,Task analysis,marine surveillance,"

Here we investigate two types of path: a linear combination (Euclidean geodesic) and a construction relying on an optimal transport map (2-Wasserstein geodesic). We test our extension by performing image denoising and k-sparse representation using atoms from a learned overcomplete kSVD dictionary. We study the application of our techniques on SWIR imagery of maritime vessels and show that our methods outperform orthogonal matching pursuit.

"a comprehensive survey of clustering algorithms: state-of-the-art machine learning applications, taxonomy, challenges, and future research prospects","2022","Clustering is an essential tool in data mining research and applications. It is the subject of active research in many fields of study, such as computer science, data science, statistics, pattern recognition, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. Several clustering techniques have been proposed and implemented, and most of them successfully find excellent quality or optimal clustering results in the domains mentioned earlier. However, there has been a gradual shift in the choice of clustering methods among domain experts and practitioners alike, which is precipitated by the fact that most traditional clustering algorithms still depend on the number of clusters provided a priori. These conventional clustering algorithms cannot effectively handle real-world data clustering analysis problems where the number of clusters in data objects cannot be easily identified. Also, they cannot effectively manage problems where the optimal number of clusters for a high-dimensional dataset cannot be easily determined. Therefore, there is a need for improved, flexible, and efficient clustering techniques. Recently, a variety of efficient clustering algorithms have been proposed in the literature, and these algorithms produced good results when evaluated on real-world clustering problems. This study presents an up-to-date systematic and comprehensive review of traditional and state-of-the-art clustering techniques for different domains. This survey considers clustering from a more practical perspective. It shows the outstanding role of clustering in various disciplines, such as education, marketing, medicine, biology, and bioinformatics. It also discusses the application of clustering to different fields attracting intensive efforts among the scientific community, such as big data, artificial intelligence, and robotics.

"a satellite-derived climatology of unreported tornadoes in forested regions of northeast europe","2018","This study presents a novel method of tornado track identification in forested regions in Europe based on remote sensing data. The method enables an objective estimate (i.e. independent of population density and observational networks) of tornado climatology in forested regions. The method is based on the identification of narrow and elongated areas as forest disturbances obtained using Landsat satellite images and Landsat-based Global Forest Change (GFC) data. These areas were subsequently verified with high-resolution satellite images for verification of a tornadic cause of forest damage. Landsat and MODIS satellite images, weather station observations and reanalysis data were additionally involved in order to determine tornado dates. A minimum F-scale tornado intensity was estimated by a Weibull distribution model using information on tornado path lengths and widths. The method is applied to the forested regions of northeast Europe, where 110 tornado tracks were identified between the 2000 and 2014years, 105 of which were previously unreported and discovered for the first time. For some regions, tornado density estimates using the new method is 2–3 times higher than other previously published estimates. The largest number of tornadoes occurred in 2009, and June is the most favourable month for tornado formation (including strong tornadoes and tornado outbreaks). Most identified tornadoes have path length <10km with maximum and mean widths of approximately 200–300m and 100–200m, respectively. A few tornadoes with long and wide paths were found; four of them likely had F3 minimal intensity.","Tornado outbreaks,Tornado-induced forest damage,Tornado climatology,Satellite data,Global Forest Change data,Tornadoes,Landsat images,"

For complex physical systems, effective digital integration can often be achieved by means of a system of aggregated digital twins coupled with a services network. Designing such a system of digital twins and services involves a daunting array of options and considerations. This paper presents a design framework that facilitates systematic, effective decisions when designing a system of digital twins to integrate the data from a complex physical system. The design framework is arranged in six steps: 1) needs and constraints analysis, 2) physical system decomposition, 3) services allocation, 4) performance and quality considerations, 5) implementation considerations and 6) verification and validation. The design framework works with a general reference architecture that combines a digital twin aggregation hierarchy with a service-oriented architecture. This reference architecture allows for the separation of concerns, computational load distribution, incremental development and modular software design.

"a single-carrier delay-and-superposition based high spectral efficiency differential chaos shift keying for maritime internet of vessels","2022","The fast growing Internet of Vessels (IoV) requires maritime communications to be more spectral efficient to make full use of the scarce maritime spectral resource, provide a high data transmission rate and support massive communication nodes to access the network. However, the spectral efficiency of most existing maritime communications are still relatively low, and consequently maritime communications can hardly support high volume multi-user communications. Therefore, in this paper, a high spectral efficiency Differential Chaos Shift Keying system based on a single-carrier delay-and-superposition modulation technology (SCDS-DCSK) is proposed for IoV scenarios. In a SCDS-DCSK symbol, all sub-carriers have the same frequency, indicating that the symbol of SCDS-DCSK only occupies the bandwidth of a single sub-channel. As a result, a large amount of maritime communication resources can be saved for accommodating more communication nodes and the spectral efficiency is significantly improved. System architectures and principles are firstly demonstrated. Then, the spectral efficiency, peak mean power ratio (PAPR), complexity, and the origin of error bits of SCDS-DCSK are analyzed, and the bit-error-rate expressions are derived. Moreover, effects of various system parameters and levels of sea states on the system performance are simulated and discussed. Simulation results verify the theoretical analyses, and manifest that the SCDS-DCSK can achieve a high spectral efficiency under various sea states. Thanks to characteristics such as high spectral efficiency, flexible parameter configuration, and simple implementation, SCDS-DCSK is a promising technology for improving the quality of service (QoS) of future maritime IoV.","single-carrier delay-and-superposition,peak mean power ratio,QoS,quality of service,SCDS-DCSK symbol,PAPR,modulation,future maritime IoV,Vessels,chaos,maritime communication resources,error statistics,Maritime communications,spectral efficiency,single subchannel,single carrier delay,Modulation,superposition modulation technology,Sea state,fast growing Internet,support massive communication nodes,chaotic communication,consequently maritime communications,Frequency modulation,high data transmission rate,Symbols,high volume multiuser communications,Chaotic communication,marine communication,maritime Internet of Vessels,Spectral efficiency,Internet of Vessels (IoV),Internet,scarce maritime spectral resource,high spectral efficiency differential chaos shift keying system,maritime communications,"

Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed QDSR can select an optimal path, thereby improve the reliability and timeliness of maritime emergency video transmission.","telecommunication network reliability,telecommunication network routing,end-to-end delay,Q-learning based delay sensitive routing protocol,Delays,rescue video,Vehicular and wireless technologies,Reliability,routing protocols,maritime accidents increase,emergency services,Routing protocols,routing,packet delivery ratio,Topology,maritime search,QDSR,ad hoc networks,frequent maritime activities,maritime emergency video transmission,rescue networks,rescue arrangements,marine communication,Simulation,maritime communication networks,Q-learning,Task analysis,delays,rescue tasks,Maritime communication networks,"
"time series analyses of tree ring chronologies from pacific north america: evidence for sub-century climate oscillations","1999","Tree ring-width chronologies from the west coast of North America were obtained from on-line data archives, maintained by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Data covered the period 1650–1983, for trees sampled at 43 sites between Dawson Creek, British Columbia (55°N) and Yosemite Park, CA (37°N). These time series were analyzed using Fourier transformation methods. Spyglass Transform software allowed the resulting power spectra to be stacked and compared, based on characteristics such as topography and continentality, latitude and species ecological niche. Results suggested that several regular or quasi-regular cycles are occurring over various time periods. There are some similarities, though not an exact match, with El Niño periodicities noted by earlier authors. These patterns appear to be widespread, affecting trees at various elevations and distances from the coast, and from different species. A separate analysis of the oldest trees revealed sub-century cycles. In particular, the longer fluctuations at 50–65 years are consistent with recent findings on north Pacific climate by other authors. A Euclidean cluster analysis of individual years identified unusual year groupings between 1924–1946, a period associated with positive temperature anomalies and generally higher precipitation. These findings appear to be consistent with other basin-scale climate cycles, like the Southern Oscillation, and the recently-proposed Pacific Interdecadal Oscillation (PDO).","Power spectra,El Niño,Pacific basin,Dendrochronology,Tree rings,Pacific Interdecadal Oscillation,Climate oscillations,"
"the usefulness of artificial intelligence for safety assessment of different transport modes","2023","Recent research in transport safety focuses on the processing of large amounts of available data by means of intelligent systems, in order to decrease the number of accidents for transportation users. Several Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications have been developed to address safety problems and improve efficiency of transportation systems. However exchange of knowledge between transport modes has been limited. This paper reviews the ML and AI methods used in different transport modes (road, rail, maritime and aviation) to address safety problems, in order to identify good practices and experiences that can be transferable between transport modes. The methods examined include statistical and econometric methods, algorithmic approaches, classification and clustering methods, artificial neural networks (ANN) as well as optimization and dimension reduction techniques. Our research reveals the increasing interest of transportation researchers and practitioners in AI applications for crash prediction, incident/failure detection, pattern identification, driver/operator or route assistance, as well as optimization problems. The most popular and efficient methods used in all transport modes are ANN, SVM, Hidden Markov Models and Bayesian models. The type of the analytical technique is mainly driven by the purpose of the safety analysis performed. Finally, a wider variety of AI and ML methodologies is observed in road transport mode, which also appears to concentrate a higher, and constantly increasing, number of studies compared to the other modes.","Machine Learning,Transportation Modes,Transportation Safety,Artificial Intelligence,"
"athlete target detection method in dynamic scenario based on nonlinear filtering and yolov5","2023","In this paper firefly optimization algorithm is improved, including the method of relative firefly fluorescence brightness, the method of attraction and the method of firefly position update. The dynamic step size factor and dynamic difference factor are introduced, and the improved firefly algorithm is used to optimize the particle filter, so that the particle swarm can be concentrated to the high likelihood region as much as possible, so as to ensure the overall quality of the particle swarm. In this paper, the most commonly used non-maximum suppression algorithm in the post-processing stage of target detection model is discussed. The original YOLOv5 model and the fusion model of nonlinear filtering and YOLOv5 were respectively used to simulate the two data sets after data enhancement. Some mainstream object detection models and the improved model in this paper are analyzed experimentally in two datasets. In dataset 1, the small increase in mAP value is the addition of CBAM's attention module, which increases by 2.8%. For data set 2, when the original Focal loss was replaced by VFLoss, the mAP increased to 89.8%, an increase of 0.95%.

"mediterranean tropical-like cyclones: impacts and composite daily means and anomalies of synoptic patterns","2018","In the Mediterranean region, a rapidly rotating storm system characterized by gale winds, severe precipitation, and low pressure center, accompanied with a spiral pattern of thunderstorms, is occasionally observed. These tropical-like cyclones (TLC), known as Medicanes or Mediterranean ‘hurricanes’, have similar characteristics with hurricanes and a significant amount of research has been done in recent years to investigate their atmospheric characteristics and impacts. The Laboratory of Climatology and Atmospheric Environment (LACAE), National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, has established a systematic effort since 2009, to document the impact of severe atmospheric phenomena (e.g. medicanes, cyclones, tornadoes, waterspouts), especially over the eastern Mediterranean region. The objective of this study is to discuss on one hand, the intra annual and inter annual distribution of medicanes along with the composite daily means and anomalies of synoptic conditions and instability indices at the middle and lower troposphere, sea level pressure (SLP) and sea surface temperature (SST) as well, during medicane days, based on the National Centers for Environmental Prediction-National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP-NCAR) reanalysis data sets. On the other hand, the geographical distribution of medicane impacts over Mediterranean region with respect to period from 1969 to 2014, is illustrated by utilizing the Geographic Information Systems (GIS). The findings shed light on the high activity of medicanes during autumn and winter with maxima in September, decreasing thereafter with a long tail extending in spring and minimizing in summer. The average number of the selected medicanes is 1.4±1.3 events per year while their inter-annual variability is remarkable, although there is not any statistically significant trend (95% confidence level) within the examined period. We found from the analysis of the composite daily anomalies of the synoptic conditions that medicanes initiate and further develop in Mediterranean regions where cold air intrusions appear in the upper atmosphere associated with warm sea waters. Last but not least, the impacts of medicanes over coastal areas, including infrastructure damage and casualties due to associated strong winds, heavy rainfall, and in rare cases, tornadoes, are well presented, indicating the high concern of such extreme atmospheric phenomena should be given by stake holders towards resilience of the society.","Tropical-like cyclones,Medicanes,Mediterranean,NCEP-NCAR reanalysis,Composite means and anomalies,Impacts,"
"an in-depth security assessment of maritime container terminal software systems","2020","Attacks on software systems occur world-wide on a daily basis targeting individuals, corporations, and governments alike. The systems that facilitate maritime shipping are at risk of serious disruptions, and these disruptions can stem from vulnerabilities in the software and processes used in these systems. These vulnerabilities leave such systems open to cyber-attack. Assessments of the security of maritime shipping systems have focused on identifying risks but have not taken the critical (and expensive) next step of actually identifying vulnerabilities present in these systems. While such risk assessments are important, they have not provided the detailed identification of security issues in the systems that control these ports and their terminals. In response, we formed a key collaboration between an experienced academic cybersecurity team and a well-known commercial software provider that manages maritime shipping. We performed an analysis of the information flow involved in the maritime shipping process, and then executed an in-depth vulnerability assessment of the software that manages freight systems. In this paper, we show the flow of information involved in the freight shipping process and explain how we performed the in-depth assessment, summarizing our findings.

"satellite machine-type communication for maritime internet of things: an interference perspective","2019","Satellite machine-type communication plays a crucial role in the maritime Internet of Things. The realization of such a system, i.e., the VHF data exchange (VDES) satellite system, however, faces many technical challenges. Due to its global broadcasting nature, the interference generated from the emissions of the VDES satellite space stations to the incumbent or future land systems in the same band is of major concern to the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) spectrum allocation. However, neither regulatory rules nor related studies have been specified or made available in the literature regarding such interference. This paper utilizes the electromagnetic power flux density (PFD) mask concept for evaluating and constraining the emission onto earth from a satellite space station. The mathematical analysis and derivation are based on the principle that the actual interference from a space station that a land system experiences is no worse than that from any other land system allowed by the regulations. We demonstrate the derivation of such a PFD mask from three closely related regulations on the legacy land mobile systems by the Electronic Communications Committee (ECC) and ITU and present the corresponding constraints imposed on the VDES satellite system and their impacts on the performance of the system.","VDES satellite space station system,interference perspective,satellite machine-type communication,maritime machine-type communication,VHF data exchange satellite system,Internet of Things,Marine vehicles,satellite communication,electromagnetic PFD mask concept,Space stations,ITU,Electronic Communications Committee,e-navigation,electronic data interchange,Maritime Internet of Things,Artificial intelligence,space communication links,maritime Internet of Things,radiofrequency interference,ITU spectrum allocation,electromagnetic power flux density mask concept,Satellite broadcasting,ECC,mathematical analysis,land system experiences,land mobile systems,Interference,International Telecommunication Union spectrum allocation,"
"coordinated maritime missions of unmanned vehicles â€” network architecture and performance analysis","2017","Multi-vehicle operations using various types of unmanned vehicles (UVs) can increase efficiency of marine data acquisition, reduce the crew risk and lower mission costs. These types of missions are very complex and often involve systems that are not interoperable. From an operational perspective however, some level of integration is necessary. Typically, a common network system architecture and Situation Awareness (SA) platform are required. The architecture allows operators to transfer data between vehicles and their operators, while the SA platform allows to monitor mission progress and react to changes. This paper presents a network system architecture used during an experiment realized in Spring 2016 in Norway. 8 departments from 5 institutions worked together to combine operation of 4 UVs (aerial, surface, underwater), a support vessel and on-shore team.

"modulation recognition in maritime multipath channels: a blind equalization-aided deep learning approach","2020","Modulation recognition has been long investigated in the literature, however, the performance could be severely degraded in multipath fading channels especially for high-order Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) signals. This could be a critical problem in the broadband maritime wireless communications, where various propagation paths with large differences in the time of arrival are very likely to exist. Specifically, multiple paths may stem from the direct path, the reflection paths from the rough sea surface, and the refraction paths from the atmospheric duct, respectively. To address this issue, we propose a novel blind equalization-aided deep learning (DL) approach to recognize QAM signals in the presence of multipath propagation. The proposed approach consists of two modules: A blind equalization module and a subsequent DL network which employs the structure of ResNet. With predefined searching step-sizes for the blind equalization algorithm, which are designed according to the set of modulation formats of interest, the DL network is trained and tested over various multipath channel parameter settings. It is shown that as compared to the conventional DL approaches without equalization, the proposed method can achieve an improvement in the recognition accuracy up to 30% in severe multipath scenarios, especially in the high SNR regime. Moreover, it efficiently reduces the number of training data that is required.","novel blind equalization-aided deep learning approach,direct path,refraction paths,Blind equalizers,blind equalization,telecommunication computing,QAM signals,Machine learning,blind equalization algorithm,Feature extraction,Quadrature amplitude modulation,blind equalisers,maritime multipath channels,propagation paths,modulation recognition,time of arrival,deep learning,rough sea surface,quadrature amplitude modulation,multipath propagation,Multipath channels,high-order Quadrature Amplitude Modulation signals,multipath channels,recognition accuracy,multipath fading channels,severe multipath scenarios,blind equalization module,reflection paths,Modulation recognition,multipath channel parameter settings,multiple paths,marine communication,conventional DL approaches,broadband maritime,Task analysis,learning (artificial intelligence),fading channels,"
"potential analysis of maritime oil spill monitoring based on modis thermal infrared data","2009","Remote sensing is a mayor way of oil spill monitoring nowadays. Compared to these active sensors, such as NIR or SAR, thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing also have capability to identify oil on backgrounds that include water, soil, ice and snow, in terms of its useful covering the TIR bands which can monitor the thermal radiance difference between them. The difference in the thermal radiance properties of oil and sea water retrieved from radiance allow potential discrimination. The essential objective in this work is to use in-situ sea surface temperature (SST) data retrieved by MODIS SST algorithm, obtain SST image information, and identify oil film from sea water. Furthermore by means of thermal infrared mapping, the feature dependent on oil film temperature change can contribute to discriminate the thickness change and trend of oil film, which is crucial to oil spill contingency planning.

"rapid modelling and design of variable speed permanent magnet generators for maritime applications","2009","Electrical power generation plays an important role in maritime vessels. This power is usually provided by a multi-component system where the generation begins with the rotational movement of a prime mover, usually and internal combustion engine, an electric generator and an assortment of power electronic components to process and regulate electrical energy. Due to the requirements of the application, i.e. power-on-demand to reduce fuel consumption and increase user comfort, all components need to be adapted to perform efficiently within a wide range of output power levels. For such a purpose a variable speed permanent magnet generator (VSPMG) is presented as a solution that fulfills most of the requirements of the power generation stage. However, the design of such of generator is a long process where multiple variables intervene. The following paper deals with a rapid modelling and design tool that helps evaluate a VSPMG with concentrated windings in a quick, and relatively accurate, manner.

The pelagic catches of China, Japan, and Korea (CJK) account for 60% of the global total, and an analysis of their activities adds essential clarity regarding global fishery resources. This paper develops a framework for analyzing the activities of HSF vessels based on satellite AIS data from 2019, which is used to study the spatial-temporal characteristics of the lengths, speeds, trajectories, and trajectory densities of HSF vessels, the numbers of active vessels, and their average fishing times. The analysis results show that: 1) Chinese HSF vessels are mostly small, relative to Japanese and Korean ships; 2) The speed of Japanese HSF vessels is consistently the highest; 3) All HSF vessels mainly fish in the Northwest Pacific, Western Central Pacific, Eastern Central Pacific, Southeast Pacific, Eastern Central Atlantic, Southeast Atlantic, and Western Indian Oceans; 4) The trajectory distribution of Chinese and Japanese vessels are similar, and both are more widely distributed than Korean vessels; 5) Chinese and Korean HSF vessels mostly enter the Atlantic through the Drake Passage, while Japanese ships mostly enter through the Panama Canal; 6) Chinese HSF vessels fish in Antarctic fisheries all year, while Korean ships aim to fish in Antarctic fisheries in the Spring, Summer, and Winter; 7) China has the largest number of HSF vessels in all fisheries, but their average fishing time is the shortest; 8) The average fishing time of all HSF vessels in Spring and Summer is short, increases during the Autumn, and continues to rise in some fisheries during Winter. This study is not only of great significance for the management and conservation of marine resources, but is also a valuable reference for the promotion of international cooperation in safeguarding marine fisheries.","High sea fishing,Pelagic fishery,Fishing vessel,Japan and Korea,China,AIS,"
"deep learning classifiers for hyperspectral imaging: a review","2019","Advances in computing technology have fostered the development of new and powerful deep learning (DL) techniques, which have demonstrated promising results in a wide range of applications. Particularly, DL methods have been successfully used to classify remotely sensed data collected by Earth Observation (EO) instruments. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is a hot topic in remote sensing data analysis due to the vast amount of information comprised by this kind of images, which allows for a better characterization and exploitation of the Earth surface by combining rich spectral and spatial information. However, HSI poses major challenges for supervised classification methods due to the high dimensionality of the data and the limited availability of training samples. These issues, together with the high intraclass variability (and interclass similarity) –often present in HSI data– may hamper the effectiveness of classifiers. In order to solve these limitations, several DL-based architectures have been recently developed, exhibiting great potential in HSI data interpretation. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the current-state-of-the-art in DL for HSI classification, analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of the most widely used classifiers in the literature. For each discussed method, we provide quantitative results using several well-known and widely used HSI scenes, thus providing an exhaustive comparison of the discussed techniques. The paper concludes with some remarks and hints about future challenges in the application of DL techniques to HSI classification.

A maritime traffic network, consisting of nodes that represent waypoint areas and navigational legs, is constructed to represent the maritime traffic at a larger scale. The proposed maritime traffic network extraction approach consists of three phases: 1) extraction of maritime traffic motion patterns based on historical Automatic Identification System data; 2) enrich the ship trajectories with semantic information and each ship trajectory is abstracted as an â€œorigin-waypoint-destinationâ€ itinerary object; 3) ship itinerary objects are further merged into nodes and edges of a directed maritime traffic network. Based on the maritime traffic network, a hierarchical reasoning approach is proposed to associate a partially observed ship trajectory to the derived compatible ship routes and ship abnormal behaviour can be detected.

"the dynamics and drivers of fuel and fire in the portuguese public forest","2014","The assumption that increased wildfire incidence in the Mediterranean Basin during the last decades is an outcome of changes in land use warrants an objective analysis. In this study we examine how annual area burned (BA) in the Portuguese public forest varied in relation to environmental and human-influenced drivers during the 1943–2011 period. Fire behaviour models were used to describe fuel hazard considering biomass removal, cover type changes, area burned, post-disturbance fuel accumulation, forest age-classes distribution and fuel connectivity. Biomass removal decreased rapidly beyond the 1940s, which, along with afforestation, increased fuel hazard until the 1980s; a subsequent decline was caused by increased fire activity. Change point analysis indicates upward shifts in BA in 1952 and in 1973, both corresponding to six-fold increases. Fire weather (expressed by the 90th percentile of the Canadian FWI during summer) increased over the study period, accounting for 18 and 36% of log(BA) variation before 1974 and after 1973, respectively. Regression modelling indicates that BA responds positively to fire weather, fuel hazard and number of fires in descending order of importance; pre-summer and 2-year lagged precipitation respectively decrease and increase BA, but the effects are minor and non-significant when both variables are included in the model. Land use conflicts (expressed through more fires) played a role, but it was afforestation and agricultural abandonment that supported the fire regime shifts, explaining weather-drought as the current major driver of BA as well. We conclude that bottom-up factors, i.e. human-induced changes in landscape flammability and ignition density, can enhance or override the influence of weather-drought on the fire regime in Mediterranean humid regions. A more relevant role of fuel control in fire management policies and practices is warranted by our findings.","Global change,Fire regime,Mediterranean Basin,Fire management,Fire modelling,Fuel hazard,"

"lmd-tshipâ‹†: vision based large-scale maritime ship tracking benchmark for autonomous navigation applications","2021","Accurate ship tracking is very important for the security of maritime activities, especially the raising requirements of autonomous navigation applications, e.g., autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs). Unlike deep-learning-based object-tracking methods are prevailing in autonomous driving because of good environmental robustness and high tracking accuracy, few deep-tracking models can be found for maritime ships. The main reason for that is the lack of qualified ship datasets, especially datasets with ship-based perspectives. Therefore, a large-scale, high-definition dataset for ship tracking, LMD-TShip (Large Maritime Dataset), is provided in this paper. In this dataset, five types of ships are included, from cargo ships, fishing ships, passenger ships, and speed boats to unmanned ships. Specifically, LMD-TShip consists of 40,240 frames in 191 videos, each of which is carefully and manually annotated with bounding boxes in YOLO format. Moreover, 13 attributes are used to label videos, e.g., scale variation (SV), occlusion (OCC), basically covering tracking challenges of maritime ship tracking. Next, a detailed analysis is carried out to demonstrate the characteristics of LMD-TShip.

"elemental constituents of atmospheric aerosols in recife, north-east brazil","1982","Few data are available on the inorganic atmospheric pollution in the rapidly expanding cities of South America, like Recife, on the Atlantic Coast of North-east Brazil. Therefore, the elemental composition of atmospheric aerosols was investigated for nine sites in the Recife conurbation and a fairly remote site in the area. Total aerosol samples were collected on cellulose filters for analysis by energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence and cascade impactors were used to collect the aerosols as a function of particle size for subsequent analysis by proton-induced X-ray emission. Local soil aliquots were also analysed. About eighteen elements were quantified in all cases. The average total atmospheric concentrations appeared to be well above natural levels but usually lower than, or comparable with, those of North American and European cities. Dispersal of sea spray and of local soil (often contaminated with, for example, Cu, Zn and Pb from industrial sources) contributes predominantly to the total atmospheric load in Recife. However, the particle size fraction results also indicated strong excesses in the small particle mode for S, K, V, Mn, Ni, Cu, Zn, Br and Pb, mainly in the downtown area.

"evaluation of uav and satellite-derived ndvi to map maritime antarctic vegetation","2020","Expansion of Antarctic vegetation in ice-free areas underlines the need for effective remote sensing techniques to properly monitor the changes. Detection and mapping of vegetation remains limited in the Antarctic environment given the complexity of its surface coverage. Some cryptogamic species exhibit low reflectance in the near-infrared region and are not easily detected by vegetation indices, such as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). In addition, spectral reflectance of Antarctic vegetation is highly variable according to seasonal conditions, which may influence NDVI results. As ultra-high resolution aerial imagery allows for a detailed analysis of vegetation and enables the validation of satellite imagery, in this study we assess the ability of the NDVI from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), Sentinel-2, and Landsat 8 to identify vegetated areas in the ice-free environment of Hope Bay, Antarctic Peninsula. NDVI classification with class ranges set by statistical parameters (i.e., mean and standard deviation) is performed. The results show that different sensors provide different NDVI values for the same vegetation class. NDVI classification enabled the identification of areas showing vegetation cover, which are in accordance with the manually mapped areas in the UAV image. Correspondence in vegetation distribution and classes can be observed across all classifications, demonstrating that aerial and satellite imagery may be used for Antarctic vegetation monitoring. A close association between NDVI classes and Antarctic vegetation type is identified, where lichens are generally classified in lower probability classes, and algae and moss in higher probability classes. This article shows the potential of NDVI applied to Antarctic vegetation and the significance of data statistical parameters in the selection of thresholds, reducing the need for ground-truth information in remote areas.","Landsat,NDVI,Sentinel-2,Remote sensing,Vegetation mapping,Antarctica,UAV,"

The visualization of Beidou and GPS is analyzed in five aspects: satellite visible number, standard single point positioning error, DOP value, signal-to-noise ratio, and multi-path effect. The results show that: (1) In the Asia-Pacific region, the positioning accuracy of Beidou's maritime islands is better than 0.734 m, 0.724 m, and 2.115 m in the N, E, and U directions, respectively, which is basically equivalent to GPS. Whereas, it is roughly 3 m, 3 m and 6 m lower than GPS outside the Asia-Pacific region, and the average number of visible satellites of Beidou in ANMG station and SOLO station is 15 and 11 respectively, which presumably means that the satellite density of Beidou system in the Asia-Pacific region is higher. (2) The average values of signal-to-noise ratio and multipath error of C22, C23, C24 and C25 stars of BeiDou are 41.638 dBHz and 0.574 m, respectively, which are basically comparable to those of G01, G02, G03 and G04 stars of GPS. The work done in this paper enriches the research related to the maritime positioning of Beidou system and plays a role in the globalization process of Beidou.","Satellites,size 0.734 m,Telecommunications,positioning capability,Beidou-3 global satellite navigation system constellation,Anubis,Global Positioning System,Stars,satellite visible number,size 2.115 m,maritime island positioning capability,size 0.724 m,Globalization,size 0.574 m,data visualization,IGS tracking stations,Asia-Pacific region,positioning service range,standard single point positioning error,Beidou's maritime islands,GPS,Software,Beidou system,satellite density,size 3.0 m,Visualization,Beidou,signal-to-noise ratio,size 6.0 m,Optics,maritime positioning,positioning accuracy,"

"assessment of the resilience of a complex network for crude oil transportation on the maritime silk road","2020","As one of the most strategically important natural resources, crude oil can be dangerous to transport by sea. The resilience of a maritime transport network denotes the ability of the system to withstand damage and remain operational after disturbances, representing the invulnerability of the network and its ability to recover from harm. In this study, we built a crude oil transportation network titled the Maritime Silk Road using Automatic Identification System (AIS) sensor data, designed a resilience assessment framework based on complex network theory, and assessed the resilience of the maritime crude oil transportation network from both qualitative and quantitative perspectives with the help of complex network metrics and a resilience model. The results show that the topology of the crude oil transportation network has a significant impact on its resilience, in that network density and centrality are negatively related to network resilience, whereas network connectivity and size are positively related to resilience. Subsequently, the resilience of crude oil transportation networks declines at a steady rate under random attacks but declines sharply under intentional attacks. Finally, a comprehensive analysis of invulnerability and recovery in the context of resilience concludes that strengthening small and medium-sized ports in the network is important to enhance network resilience. These results can provide reference and decision support for port planning, route design, optimization, and form a foundation for a more secure and reliable maritime transportation network system.","resilience assessment framework,Safety,maritime transport network,crude oil transportation network,complex network metrics,goods distribution,network resilience,Resilience,Maritime Silk Road,complex network theory,reliable maritime transportation network system,complex network,Oils,network connectivity,secure maritime transportation network system,network theory (graphs),Complex networks,Artificial intelligence,sea ports,crude oil,network density,Roads,maritime crude oil transportation network,mathematical analysis,petroleum industry,complex networks,AIS data,maritime silk road,"
"behavioral detection in the maritime domain","2015","The maritime domain is important to the security, prosperity and vital interests of the global community. In order to protect these interests, governments require capabilities that provide situational awareness of the maritime domain. In [11] a spatiotemporal analysis approach is proposed that autonomously analyzes and classifies ship movement and possible intent at sea. The analysis focuses on detection of vessels of interest that exhibit one behavior, paralleling or following behavior. In this paper, we extend this approach by proposing a generalized semantic method that enables consideration of other behaviors of interest. Additionally we conduct a series of simulations using simulated and real AIS data to assess the performance of the algorithm to variation in behavior thresholds.","Semantics,spatiotemporal clustering algorithm,ship movement classification,Clustering algorithms,sensor fusion,Spatiotemporal phenomena,high-level data fusion,Marine vehicles,maritime domain awareness,automated identification system,Modeling,signal classification,High-level data fusion,spatiotemporal analysis approach,ships,spatiotemporal analysis,real AIS data,maritime domain,behavior detection,pattern clustering,situational awareness,vessel detection,Measurement,clustering,signal detection,behavioral detection,generalized semantic method,pattern detection,marine control,activity-based intelligence,"
"precise localization for achieving next-generation autonomous navigation: state-of-the-art, taxonomy and future prospects","2020","Achieving full autonomy in navigation is a complicated problem. The most widely used solution takes up the modular framework for sensing and information processing such as perception, mapping, control, planning and decision making. However, this approach misses the capability of environmental understanding. Hence, to achieve full autonomy in navigation a computing model with self-learning capability inspired by biological intelligence such as memorizing, inferring and experience update is essential for dynamic and noisy environments. Recent advanced sensing, communication and hardware miniaturization technologies achieved few autonomous operations in commercial systems but the full autonomy has not been attained yet. In this paper, the effect of precise and accurate localization for autonomous navigation technologies is extensively studied and the problems and limitations of the related algorithms are analyzed. The major limitations for precise localization are computational complexity, sensor noise and communication delays. These limitations further reduce perception and planning capabilities of autonomous navigation systems. From this study, the future prospects are outlined to achieve a higher level of autonomy by precise localization.","Sensor fusion,Autonomous system,AUV,Network localization,Autonomous mobile robots,Navigation,Localization,Perception,Micro air vehicle,Mapping,UAV,Sensing,"

"coastal water bathymetry for critical zone management using regression tree models from gaofen-6 imagery","2021","Coastal water depth information is fundamental to coast management and coastal critical zone development. The traditional bathymetric sounding method depends on radar or surveying vessels, which are expensive and time-consuming. Thus, it is of high importance to develop a rapidly updating water depth detection method. In order to bridge this gap, we explored the Chinese Gaofen-6 wide field of view (GF-6 WFV) visible-near infrared satellite imagery for large-scale accurate coastal bathymetric mapping and to understand the vertical water column environment with regression tree models. The predictors, including the Blue band/Violet band (BV), Green band/Violet band (GV), Yellow band/Violet band (YV), Green band (G), Yellow band (Y), and red-edge1 band (Re1), were derived via statistical analysis, as well as spectroscopy knowledge and experience. Compared with the conventional bathymetric method, such as single band algorithm (SBA), band ratio algorithm and support vector regression (SVR), the two regression trees used in this study yielded better accuracy. The R2, MAE and RMSE of the classification and regression tree (CART), the Cubist tree model were 0.74, 3.78 m and 5.35 m vs 0.78, 3.56 m and 4.88 m. Besides the improved accuracies, these tree-based models can effectively reveal water depth-associated environment types with the hierarchical relationships present in the visible spectral characteristics, which supports spatial zoning strategies for coastal critical zone management based on the Gaofen-6 imagery.","Bathymetry,Violet-related spectral ratio,Regression trees,SVR,Gaofen-6 satellite,Critical coastal zone management,"

"assessing the state of marine biodiversity in the northeast atlantic","2022","The Northeast Atlantic, a highly productive maritime area, has been exposed to a wide range of direct human pressures, such as fishing, shipping, coastal development, pollution, and non-indigenous species (NIS) introductions, in addition to anthropogenically-driven global climate change. Nonetheless, this regional sea supports a high diversity of species and habitats, whose functioning provides a variety of ecosystem services, essential for human welfare. In 2017, OSPAR, the Northeast Atlantic Regional Seas Commission, delivered an assessment of marine biodiversity for the Northeast Atlantic. This assessment examined biodiversity indicators separately to identify changes in Northeast Atlantic biodiversity, but stopped short of determining the status of biodiversity for many species and habitats. Here, we expand on this work and for the first time, a semi-quantitative approach is applied to evaluate holistically the state of Northeast Atlantic marine biodiversity across marine food webs, from plankton to top predators, via fish, pelagic and benthic habitats, including xeno-biodiversity (i.e. NIS). Our analysis reveals widespread degradation in marine ecosystems and biodiversity, particularly for marine birds and coastal bottlenose dolphins, as well as for benthic habitats and fish in some regions. The poor biodiversity status of these ecosystem components is likely the result of cumulative effects of human activities, such as habitat destruction or disturbance, overexploitation, eutrophication, the introduction of NIS, and climate change. Bright spots are also revealed, such as recent signs of recovery in some fish and marine bird communities and recovery in harbour and grey seal populations and the condition of coastal benthic communities in some regions. The status of many indicators across all ecosystem components, but particularly for the novel pelagic habitats, food webs and NIS indicators, however, remains uncertain due to gaps in data, unclear pressure-state relationships, and the non-linear influence of some pressures on biodiversity indicators. Improving monitoring and data access and increasing understanding of pressure-state relationships, including those that are non-linear, is therefore a priority for enabling future assessments, as is consistent and stable resourcing for expert involvement.","Ecosystem approach,Indicators,Marine Strategy Framework Directive,Holistic assessment,Anthropogenic pressures,Food webs,"

"ship collision avoidance behaviour recognition and analysis based on ais data","2022","A novel approach is proposed to automatically identify the ship collision avoidance behaviour from ship trajectories based on an improved Sliding Window Algorithm. The approach has three main stages: (1) determining the ships’ obligations according to the Convention on the International Regulations for Preventing Collision at Sea (COLREGs); (2) assessing the rudder angle according to the true bearing of the target ship; (3) identifying the corresponding ship handling behaviour from the ship trajectory taking into account the Rate of Turn and its derivative based on the Sliding Window Algorithm. Four typical encounter scenarios are studied to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method. The approach is then applied to near collision scenarios identified in the maritime traffic off the continental coast of Portugal, which allowed the characterization of the relative and spatial distributions of the locations at which the ships take evasive manoeuvres. The results show that the approach can be applied to accurately detect the ship collision avoidance behaviour from Automatic Identification System trajectory data, and the characterization of the collision avoidance behaviour can potentially be used by situational awareness systems and as the basis for ship collision avoidance decision-making.","Ship evasive manoeuvring,Near collision scenario,Collision avoidance,Sliding window Algorithm,"

Tracking and monitoring from the coast all type of ship on a common operational picture is no more sufficient. An Innovative solution shall be set up to support human operators in their permanent surveillance tasks in vulnerable trading lanes and zones in order to detect abnormal or illicit vessel behaviour and to understand and to early identify threatening situations. Displaying thousands of tracks on a single display has be demonstrated its inefficiency, in front of all the cases of illegal immigration, terrorism, drugs trafficking, smuggling, illegal fishing, pollution, etc... that were recorded this year. This future generation of maritime surveillance system must allow: 1) Permanent and all weather coverage of border maritime areas. 2) Continuous collection and fusion of heterogeneous data provided by various types of sensors deployed on coast and on mobile platforms and other information from external sources. 3) Supervised automatic detection of abnormal vessel behaviours (in track and performed activity) and generate justified alarms. 4) Understanding of suspicious events and early identification of threats from series of detected spatiotemporal abnormal vessel behaviours (alarms). 5) Generate electronic and formatted interpretation reports on the suspicious event to keep periodically informed decisional authorities. 6) Anticipate the operational response mobilizing and using means with the best efficiency as possible 7) To capitalize knowledge and work of each partner, within an inter-agencies and international framework, for a common benefit on a real time basis 8) To ensure the data protection respecting the respective rules of information sharing. No equipment and information system deployed are currently able to answer all these requirements together. However, in the horizon of 2015 significant technical progresses will be made in wide maritime area coverage detection and highlighting abnormal behaviors methodology that could be usefully used together to built up an new generation of sea border surveillance integrated system for efficient security applications in high density traffics. The objectives of the SISMARIS project are: 1) To build up a complete test system (end to end information acquisition and processing system). 2) To test new maritime surveillance sensors and other available intelligent information sources in order to obtain optimal maritime security awareness. 3) To demonstrate that this new information system will help the operator to analyze automatically a high density of tracks in order to highlight only the useful information, and detect some predefined behavior that could be abnormal or not. 4) To give the police authorities a helpful tool to collect and register evidences in order to prosecute usefully offenders.

Indeed, SG cyber-physical connectivity is subject to several vulnerabilities that can damage or disrupt its process immunity via cyberthreats. Today's ICSs are experiencing highly complex data change and dynamism, increasing the complexity of detecting and mitigating cyberattacks. Subsequently, and since Machine Learning (ML) is widely studied in cybersecurity, the objectives of this paper are twofold. First, for algorithmic simplicity, a small-scale ML algorithm that attempts to reduce computational costs is proposed. The algorithm adopts a neural network with an augmented hidden layer (NAHL) to easily and efficiently accomplish the learning procedures. Second, to solve the data complexity problem regarding rapid change and dynamism, a label autoencoding approach is introduced for Embedding Labels in the NAHL (EL-NAHL) architecture to take advantage of labels propagation when separating data scatters. Furthermore, to provide a more realistic analysis by addressing real-world threat scenarios, a dataset of an electric traction substation used in the high-speed rail industry is adopted in this work.

"on the effectiveness of ai-assisted anomaly detection methods in maritime navigation","2020","The automatic identification system (AIS) has become an essential tool for maritime security. Nevertheless, how to effectively use the static and dynamic voyage information of the AIS data in maritime traffic situation awareness is still a challenge. This paper presents a comparative study of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques on their effectiveness in dealing with various anomalies in maritime domain using the AIS data. The AIS on-off switching (OOS) anomaly is critical in maritime security, since AIS technology is susceptible to manipulation and it can be switched on and off to hide illegal activities. Thus, we try to detect and distinguish between intentional and non-intentional AIS OOS anomalies through our AI -assisted anomaly detection framework. We use AIS data, in particular positional and navigational status of vessels, to study the effectiveness of seven AI techniques, such as artificial neural network, support vector machine, logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, decision tree, random forest and naive Bayes, in detecting the AIS OOS anomalies. Our experimental results show that ANN and SVM are the most suitable techniques in detecting the AIS OOS anomalies with 99.9% accuracy. Interestingly, the ANN model outperforms others when trained with a balanced (i.e., same order of samples per class) dataset, and SVM, on the other hand, is suitable when training dataset is unbalanced.","maritime traffic situation awareness,AI-assisted anomaly detection,decision trees,Support vector machines,logistic regression,Anomaly detection,static voyage information,random forests,ANN,marine navigation,Feature extraction,security of data,maritime security,k-nearest neighbors,regression analysis,AIS technology,naive Bayes,neural nets,naive Bayes methods,automatic identification system,marine safety,marine engineering,support vector machines,maritime navigation,dynamic voyage information,maritime domain,random forest,SVM,Artificial intelligence,AIS on-off switching anomaly,nearest neighbour methods,artificial neural network,Training,Trajectory,support vector machine,nonintentional AIS OOS anomalies,Navigation,artificial intelligence,decision tree,AIS data,"

Our study constructs an encoder-decoder network driven by a forward and reverse comprehensive historical trajectory and then fuses the characteristics of the sub-network to predict the ship trajectory. The AIS historical trajectory data of US West Coast ships are employed to investigate the feasibility of the proposed method. Compared with the current methods, the proposed approach lessens the prediction error by studying the comprehensive historical trajectory, and 60.28% has reduced the average prediction error. The ocean and port trajectory data are analyzed in maritime transportation before and after COVID-19. The prediction error in the port area is reduced by 95.17% than the data before the epidemic. Our work helps the prediction of maritime ship trajectory, provides valuable services for maritime safety, and performs detailed insights for the analysis of trade conditions in different sea areas before and after the epidemic.","epidemics,Transportation,Automatic Identification System spatio-temporal data,port trajectory data,Hidden Markov models,ship transportation,average prediction error,transportation,Marine vehicles,intelligent maritime transportation,comprehensive historical trajectory,Predictive models,bidirectional data-driven trajectory prediction method,West Coast ships,bidirectional data-driven,Maritime transportation,maritime ship trajectory,ships,marine safety,marine engineering,Data models,ship trajectory prediction,promising enabling technologies,Artificial intelligence,intelligent maritime traffic,physical labor force,Trajectory,trajectory prediction,route optimization,diseases,collision avoidance,automatic identification system (AIS) data,encoder-decoder network,maritime safety,AIS historical trajectory data,"
"road-safety-ii: opportunities and barriers for an enhanced road safety vision","2022","Road safety research is largely focused on prediction and prevention of technical, human or organisational failures that may result in critical conflicts or crashes. Indicators of traffic risk aim to capture the passage to unsafe states. However, research in other industries has shown that it is meaningful to analyse safety along the whole spectrum of behaviours. Knowing the causes and patterns of “successful” interactions, rather than failures, could give new insights on the complexity of the system and the adaptability and resilience of its users in handling the inherent risks. The concept is known as Safety-II and has been extensively explored in the aviation, healthcare and process engineering domains. In this paper, we explore a new Safety-II paradigm for road safety research. We briefly review Safety-II applications in other sectors. We then present a Safety-II model for road safety, by means of an inverse version of Hyden’s “safety pyramid”. Furthermore, we discuss a number of key road safety goals, theories, analysis methods and data sources and map them into a tentative taxonomy of Safety-I and Safety-II applications. It is concluded that there can be opportunities and benefits from adopting this new mindset, in order to complement existing approaches.","Safety-II,Road safety,Driver behaviour,Traffic conflicts,"
"locating submerged prehistoric settlements: a new underwater survey method using water-jet coring and micro-geoarchaeological techniques","2021","In the past few decades the field of submerged prehistory has produced important data highlighting ancient coastal habitation across the globe. Most prehistoric underwater sites are discovered by chance (e.g., by industry, fishermen or recreational divers). New methods for detecting submerged prehistoric settlements have been developed using sophisticated remote sensing devices, yet with limited success. Simple, practical, and inexpensive methods for locating submerged settlements remain rare. Over 60 years of underwater archaeology and submerged prehistory in Israel, specifically along the Carmel coast, has led to a model for locating and studying submerged settlements, based on sand removal by storms. This study aimed to take this model a step further by developing a new, inexpensive method to identify, locate and characterize submerged sites. We collected undisturbed paleosol cores from exposed areas as well as under a few meters of sand, using a newly developed water-jet core sampling system. The cores were analyzed using micro-geoarchaeological techniques initially developed on terrestrial sites. The rationale behind this methodology is based on established knowledge that where human settlements occur, sediments are enriched by specific mineralogical signatures (e.g., heated clay minerals) and anthropogenic micro-remain assemblages (e.g., phytoliths, ash pseudomorphs and dung spherulites). Additionally, micromorphology can assist in identifying micro-stratigraphic patterns typical of human settlements. We tested sediment cores in three underwater contexts: a) exposed prehistoric surfaces within two known Neolithic sites (Atlit-Yam and Neve Yam), b) exposed paleosols without visible archaeological remains (serving as a control), and c) as a blind test, a buried paleosol currently covered by 1–3 m of sand, where the existence of a site is unknown. In the cores taken from the exposed Neolithic settlements, the micro-geoarchaeological characterization showed clear anthropogenic signals (typical mineralogy, elevated micro-remain concentrations, micro-stratigraphy). In the paleosol control cores, there was an absence (or negligible presence) of anthropogenic signals. The ‘blind test’ at the sand-covered locality revealed sediments without anthropogenic enrichments (similar to the control paleosols), thus suggesting the absence of a submerged settlement in this specific location. The new method is time- and cost-effective and can easily be applied worldwide along the shallow continental shelf as well as in deep water. The new method will facilitate discovery of new underwater sites and provide selection criteria (e.g., where the highest anthropogenic signal exists) for investment in underwater excavations. Additionally, it can be used to check for anthropogenic signals in buried locations detected by remote sensing, and to understand the spatial organization of submerged sites.","Manual coring,Neolithic Carmel coast,Micro-geoarchaeology,Submerged prehistory,Underwater archaeology,Water-jet coring,"

"precision analysis of the maritime multi-sensor data alignment based on relative bearing and rang","2010","To solve data alignment problem of multi-platform multi-sensor on the sea, a multi-sensor data alignment method based on relative bearing and range is proposed. Using the measurements of relative bearing and range among the maritime platforms, the targets' positions measured are transformed in the sensor relative bearing cordinates of a platform, and the sensor alignment is achieved. The method above can be implemented by means of two coordinate transformation approachs. The alignment mechanisms and mathematical models of both approachs are discussed.

"enhancing ais to improve whale-ship collision avoidance and maritime security","2009","Whale-ship strikes are of growing worldwide concern due to the steady growth of commercial shipping. Improving the current situation involves the creation of a communication capability allowing whale position information to be estimated and exchanged among vessels and other observation assets. An early example of such a system has been implemented for the shipping lane approaches to the harbor of Boston, Massachusetts where ship traffic transits areas of the Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary frequently used by whales. It uses the Automated Identification Systems (AIS) technology, currently required for larger vessels but becoming more common in all classes of vessels. However, we believe the default mode of AIS operation will be inadequate to meet the long-term needs of whale-ship collision avoidance, and will likewise fall short of meeting other current and future marine safety and security communication needs. This paper explores the emerging safety and security needs for vessel communications, and considers the consequences of a communication framework supporting asynchronous messaging that can be used to enhance the basic AIS capability. The options we analyze can be pursued within the AIS standardization process, or independently developed with attention to compatibility with existing AIS systems. Examples are discussed for minimizing ship interactions with Humpback Whales and endangered North Atlantic Right Whales on the east coast, and North Pacific Right Whales, Bowhead Whales, Humpback Whales, Blue Whales and Beluga Whales in west coast, Alaskan and Hawaiian waters.","marine accidents,North Atlantic right Whales,Whale-ship collision avoidance,Communication system security,Standardization,Marine vehicles,vessel communications,maritime security,Sea measurements,Whale position information,AIS technology,Humpback Whales,ships,marine safety,marine engineering,Collision avoidance,Oceans,Beluga Whales,Boston,automated identification systems technology,North Pacific Right Whales,Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary,Economic forecasting,AIS enhancement,Marine technology,Bowhead Whales,Marine safety,Massachusetts,collision avoidance,Blue Whales,Whales,"
"prospects and challenges in unlocking natural-gas-hydrate energy in india: recent advancements","2022","Natural gas hydrate deposits hold huge potential as a future energy resource of the world including India. To help realize these resources, India carried out two dedicated research expeditions (NGHP-01 and 02) to identify, characterize and analyze natural gas hydrate resource potential in its maritime boundaries. This work presents a review of the current status of research and development activities in the area of natural gas hydrate systems in India taking a cue from the NGHP-02 research findings. The NGHP-02 is considered one of the most extensive research programs to date for drilling and pressure core collection. This program resulted in minimally disturbed and well-preserved core samples collected from pressure-coring. Logging while drilling, wireline logging, formation pressure testing, vertical seismic profiling, and pressure core analysis confirmed one of the highly saturated (~40%–100%), sand-based, hydrate accumulation in three ultradeep locations, Area B, C, and E, eastern offshore India. The shipborne evaluation helped in the collection of the most suitable core samples to perform the first-ever comprehensive post-cruise triaxial testing, to obtain key petrophysical and geomechanical properties of interest. Further, a suitably designed experimental strategy helped to collect multiple sets of data from utilizing a lesser number of pressure core samples. The most prominent experiments included drained-undrained consolidation and compression, multistage compression and consolidation, alternating strain-rate compression, and permeability evaluation tests. The seal overlying hydrate layer are primarily made of clay rich sediments. The permeability measurements findings of the tested samples were reported in the range of 0.01 to tens of mD depending upon hydrate saturation, sand particle distribution, and range of applied effective stress. Significant permeability loss (∼90%) with increasing effective stress (up to 10 MPa) was noted. Further, permeability anisotropy, a ratio of horizontal to vertical permeability = 4, is reported to be consistent with the values reported for other marine hydrate-bearing sediments. The geochemical analysis put the natural gas to be primarily composed of methane mostly from microbial sources however part contribution from deeper sources was not ruled out. Moreover, numerical modeling of sand migration, thermal characterization, hydrate morphology, and extensive reservoir simulations was also used to obtain greater insight into the nature of the hydrate deposition system and its resource potential. Hydrate occurrences in an ultradeep and shallow subseafloor environment, such as those found in the Krishna-Godavari basin, pose challenge to well bore stability and sustained gas production due to the combined effect of high-pressure drawdown and hydrate dissociation induced strength loss and sand migration. Hence, incorporation of a coupled flow, geomechanical and sand migration analysis in well bore stability and reservoir simulation are suggested as a way forward. The NGHP-02 program and its findings not only advance India's endeavor to locally produce natural gas from these unconventional resources but also provides valuable information concerning exploitation of other marine gas hydrate accumulations found elsewhere in the world.","Gas hydrate reservoir,Logging while drilling,Seismic profile,Pressure core,Reservoir simulation,Geomechanical properties,Krishna-Godavari basin,"

They shed light on the scope of interregional trade in which this Late Bronze Age harbour city participated from the 15th to the 12th centuries B.C. Although the results from older excavations suggested the city’s engagement in interregional trade, these preliminary conclusions were based on chronologically and geographically restricted material and only a few scientific analyses, which have since been complemented and partly revised. It is now clear that long-distance exchange, based on the large-scale intra-urban production and distribution of copper, involved regional and more distant suppliers of coveted goods, and resulted in the transition of the settlement from a late 17th century B.C. village to a trade hub with a minimum extent of 25 ha.","Sardinia,Mycenae,Crete,Mesopotamia,Levant,Cyprus,Fauna,Georadar,Fish remains,Late Bronze Age,Copper production,FTIR,Magnetometers,Egypt,NAA,Interregional trade,Petrography,"
"testing phytolith analysis approaches to estimate the prehistoric anthropogenic burning regime on the central california coast","2017","Expanding on a previous study that used phytolith analysis and other evidence to show that native people within Quiroste Valley on California's Central Coast used frequent fire to actively manage vegetation by arresting succession toward shrubs or forest to maintain open grassland during the Late Holocene, we extracted phytoliths from soils at sites located on a 500 m grid throughout the coastal portion of the watershed. We found that the prehistoric grass-dominated grassland, likely maintained by frequent anthropogenic fire, extended to the landscape scale, well beyond the confines of Quiroste Valley. In a novel attempt to use the proportion of burned phytoliths in the soil to quantitatively estimate prehistoric fire frequency at nearby McCabe Canyon in Pinnacles National Park, we tested three approaches described in the phytolith literature to identify individual burned soil phytoliths and found each approach had serious problems. The first approach, identifying visually darkened phytoliths, was accurate when performed on freshly burned leaf material, but highly problematic when applied to weathered phytoliths extracted from a typical grassland soil. The second approach, using changes in the refractive index caused by heating of phytoliths, was not effective within the temperature range typical of grassland fires, and was prone to rehydration effects in the soil environment. The third approach, using Raman spectroscopy to identify phytoliths with spectral changes caused by heating of carbon occluded in phytoliths, was not able to distinguish heated, non-darkened phytoliths, but was able to distinguish visually darkened phytoliths that had been subjected to an open flame. Each approach was rejected as inadequate; we were unable to use phytoliths to quantitatively estimate prehistoric fire frequency. Additional research quantifying the effects of weathering on soil phytolith coloration and opacity may make the visual approach viable.",""

"a systematic literature review on wireless security testbeds in the cyber-physical realm","2023","The Cyber-Physical System (CPS) lies in the core of Industry 4.0, accelerating the convergence of formerly barricaded operational technology systems with modern information technology ones. Nevertheless, the increased connectivity in terms of both wired and wireless links and associated attack surfaces that comes along, requires higher security for safeguarding critical industrial systems and manufacturing lines from cyberattacks. In this rapidly evolving ecosystem, security testbeds have emerged as a versatile, cost-effective solution for investigating potential attack vectors and devising appropriate countermeasures, without putting the real system at risk. The present work seeks to address a prominent literature gap, namely, the lack of a systematic review regarding the use of wireless-oriented security testbeds in CPS. We contribute an overarching, manifold review on this topic from 2016 onward, examining the various literature works from diverse angles, namely, the wireless technologies used, the implemented attacks, the employed security controls, and more. The analysis is done on a per-sector basis, including water and wastewater systems, healthcare, transportation, agriculture, energy, maritime, unmanned aircraft systems, and others. Finally yet importantly, we discuss key takeaways, open issues, and challenges. The key observations of our analysis, including almost 50 articles, can be wrapped up into two salient points: on the one hand, wireless technologies are increasingly penetrating into the CPS domain as an orthogonal, versatile solution to their wired counterparts, but on the other, they widen the window of opportunity for threat actors targeting wireless links. In this context, testbed thoroughness and security as a trade-off seem to be of major importance, alongside a modular, possibly sector-neutral reference architecture that overarches the peculiarities of CPS. Overall, to our knowledge, this work provides the first full-fledged survey on the use of wireless-oriented security testbeds in CPS, and it is therefore anticipated to serve as a groundwork and touchstone for several stakeholders at different levels.","CI,Cybersecurity,CPS,SLR,Security testbeds,Wireless technologies,"

"choose clean energy or green technology? empirical evidence from global ships","2021","On January 1st, 2020, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) implemented a new regulation for a 0.50% global sulphur cap for marine fuels, which was a dramatic decrease from the previous emissions cap of 3.5%. The new regulation will have an enormous impact on the shipping market. At present, there are different feasible schemes for reducing sulphur emissions from ships. Shipowners need to consider the economic cost, energy feasibility, and other relevant factors of different schemes before making decisions. This paper empirically explores the factors that affect shipowners' energy choices. Based on the new emerging individual ship dynamic data, Automatic Identification System (AIS), and other relevant databases, we apply various data mining methods and a threshold discrete choice model combined with an oversampling technique to conduct quantitative measurements and statistical analyses of factors for each ship type that affect the shipowners' choices. Three groups of indicators, including ship characteristics, shipowner characteristics, and market conditions, are considered in our analysis.

"mobility pattern analysis of ship trajectories based on semantic transformation and topic model","2020","Recognition and understanding of ship mobility pattern have great significance for intelligent maritime applications, i.e. route discovery and anomaly detection. Besides a number of pattern discovery techniques currently derived from ship trajectory, topic modeling popular in the field of Natural Language Processing may provide a novel way to detect implicit patters underlying massive ship trajectories treated as documents. This paper is motivated to apply a semantic analysis method to explore potential mobility patterns from ship trajectories in inland river by combining semantic transformation and topic model. A coarse-grained semantic transformation model is firstly defined to translate each ship trajectory into a document containing a series of sequential motion words. A motion word is generally a synthetic semantic representation of three trajectory features (location, course and speed). All ship trajectories can then be examined and analyzed as a document corpus. A classic topic model (i.e. Latent Dirichlet Allocation, LDA) is employed to explore hidden ship mobility patterns from trajectory document corpus. The effectiveness of this approach is illustrated through a case study at Wuhan waterway, located at middle stream of Yangtze River in China.","Ship mobility pattern,Trajectory analysis,Topic modeling,Automatic identification system,"
"southern annular mode impacts on global ocean surface waves","2018","We assess the impact of the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) on global ocean wind waves using 30 years of wave data from a wave model hindcast that is forced with high resolution surface winds from the NCEP-CFSR reanalysis. Our primary focus is on the wave field and swell influence in the Southern Hemisphere, and we apply our analysis to each of the four temperate-zone seasons comprising March–May (MAM), June–August (JJA), September-November (SON), and December–February (DJF). Statistically significant anomalies in significant wave height (Hs), peak wave period (Tp) and zonal wave energy flux (CgE) are found to covary with local variations in surface zonal wind induced by the low and high polarity phases of the SAM. The signature of the SAM in ocean surface waves extends beyond local wind-generated forcing in the Southern Hemisphere extratropics to remote forcing in the Northern Hemisphere extratropics during DJF, with the associated atmospheric signal resembling a tropically-forced Rossby wave train. This has a significant impact on surface waves in the central North Pacific and North Atlantic oceans. The El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) acts to weaken the link between the SAM and Northern Hemisphere winter climate, with the zonal wind / divergence anomalies amplifying over the tropical Pacific Ocean when we exclude El Niño and La Niña years from the analysis. This remote link to the SAM thus occurs independent of ENSO via SAM-driven changes to the tropical atmospheric circulation, suggesting that the SAM may provide a useful predictive signal for the Northern Hemisphere during DJF. The SAM also influences the occurrence of daily low (below the 5th percentile) and high (above the 95th percentile) wave conditions, emphasizing that the SAM may be a valuable source of predictable wave variability from sub-weekly to seasonal timescales. Future work should explore wave data suitable for trend analysis, considering the positive trend in the SAM over recent decades.",""
"mbas (methylene blue active substances) and las (linear alkylbenzene sulphonates) in mediterranean coastal aerosols: sources and transport processes","2011","Methylene Blue Active Substances (MBAS) and Linear Alkylbenzene Sulphonates (LAS) concentrations, together with organic carbon and ions were measured in atmospheric coastal aerosols in the NW Mediterranean Basin. Previous studies have suggested that the presence of surfactants in coastal aerosols may result in vegetation damage without specifically detecting or quantifying these surfactants. Coastal aerosols were collected at a remote site (Porquerolles Island-Var, France) and at a more anthropised site (San Rossore National Park-Tuscany, Italy). The chemical data were interpreted according to a comprehensive local meteorological analysis aiming to decipher the airborne source and transport processes of these classes of compounds. The LAS concentration (anthropogenic surfactants) was measured in the samples using LC-MS/MS, a specific analytical method. The values were compared with the MBAS concentration, determined by a non-specific analytical method. At Porquerolles, the MBAS concentration (103 ± 93 ng m−3) in the summer samples was significantly higher than in the winter samples. In contrast, LAS concentrations were rarely greater than in the blank filters. At San Rossore, the mean annual MBAS concentration (887 ± 473 ng m−3 in PM10) contributed about 10% to the total atmospheric particulate organic matter. LAS mean concentration in these same aerosol samples was 11.5 ± 10.5 ng m−3. A similar MBAS (529 ± 454 ng m−3) – LAS (7.1 ± 4.1 ng m−3 LAS) ratio of ∼75 was measured in the fine (PM2.5) aerosol fraction. No linear correlation was found between MBAS and LAS concentrations. At San Rossore site the variation of LAS concentrations was studied on a daily basis over a year. The LAS concentrations in the coarse fraction (PM10–2.5) were higher during strong sea storm conditions, characterized by strong air flow coming from the sea sector. These events, occurring with more intensity in winter, promoted the formation of primary marine aerosols containing LAS from the sea surface microlayer. In contrast to LAS, MBAS concentrations in the coarse fraction peaked in summer. Therefore, different sources are suggested for the two classes of compounds. In summer, increased MBAS concentration could be an indicator of phytoplanktonic blows enriching the sea surface microlayer with biogenic surfactants. In winter, some spikes in MBAS concentrations in the coarse fraction could be related to LAS concentrations and sea storm events. Moreover, in the fine fraction MBAS have a large concentration maxima in winter, corresponding to air masses coming from polluted continental areas. It is concluded that MBAS concentration in the fine or the coarse fraction is not an appropriate surrogate measurement of LAS concentration in aerosols because of the significant contribution from other sources to the MBAS concentration.","MBAS,PM2.5,Surfactants,PM10,LAS,Mediterranean coastal sites,"
"spatiotemporal variability in bio-optical characteristics of the southwestern tropical indian ocean during boreal summer: biophysical influences","2022","The bio-optical characteristics of the surface ocean play a pivotal role in radiative transfer and photosynthetic carbon fixation. To examine spatiotemporal variability of bio-optical properties in the tropical Indian Ocean, a 10-day time-series comparative study was made at one fixed and 3 variable stations in the southwestern tropical Indian Ocean (SWTIO), and 4-stations in the Equatorial Indian Ocean (EIO) during June 2014. A total of 24 hyperspectral radiometer profiles were collected along with physicochemical parameters and phytoplankton pigments analysis. A negative sea level anomaly (SLA), higher precipitation, a more stable mixed layer, and higher buoyancy frequency (N2) were observed in SWTIO compared to EIO. The deep chlorophyll maxima (DCM) in SWTIO were characterised by deep biomass maxima (DBM) whereas in the EIO it was due to deep photoacclimation maxima (DAM). The photosynthetically available radiation (PAR) profiles were obtained by integrating downwelling irradiance from 400 to 700 nm suggesting that the SWTIO had a greater abundance of optically active substances (OAS) than the EIO. Surface chlorophyll a (Chl-a) was found to have significant relationships with phytoplankton absorption coefficient (aph(443)). Chl-a-specific phytoplankton absorption coefficients (a*ph(443)), total absorption coefficient (at(443)), and particulate backscattering (bbp(555)) were also related to Chl-a implying that the phytoplankton was in growth/active phase. The time-series variability of the phytoplankton and changes in the photosynthetic pigments (PSP) to photoprotective pigments (PPP) ratio at SWTIO suggested phytoplankton community shift during 5th to 7th days. Microplankton percent-abundances showed distinct linear relationships with Chl-a and bbp(555) implying that carbon fixation per unit Chl-a was higher in microplankton than in nano and picoplankton at SWTIO. The in situ Chl-a, aph(443), adg(443), Kd(490) and C¯ pd were used to validate the various empirical algorithms available as well as the satellite-retrieved data. The MODIS and VIIRS data correlated moderately. This study would help towards improving regional optimized algorithms for OAS and provide a baseline understanding of the scale of variability of primary production and carbon flux from space. In addition, this would contribute valuable bio-optical data from an under-sampled geographical area.","Subsurface stratification,Light absorption,Tropical Indian Ocean,Particulate backscattering,Deep chlorophyll maxima,Phytoplankton pigments,"
"instantaneous global navigation satellite system (gnss)-based attitude determination for maritime applications","2012","Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) is a valuable technology for a large number of maritime applications. Other than providing the absolute positioning service, it aids many demanding applications, such as precise docking, formation of surface craft, autonomous vehicles, sinkage monitoring, etc. GNSS carrier-phase-based algorithms provide high-precision positioning solutions, but an integer number of cycles inherent to the observed signal have to be resolved. A newly developed GNSS carrier-phase ambiguity resolution method is tested. The new method solves for the unknown number of integer cycles by exploiting the known placement of the GNSS antennas aboard the vessel. The a priori information on the antennas baseline separation is employed as a hard constraint. A simplified (linearized) version of the method, suitable for large vessels, is also analyzed. The new method was tested against the most challenging scenario when processing GNSS data: single-frequency, single-epoch, unaided ambiguity resolution. Through different tests, the high performance of the new method is demonstrated: high fixing rate, large robustness, and short time-to-fix after initialization, cycle slips, and/or loss of locks.

"morpho-bathymetric acoustic surveys as a tool for mapping traces of anthropogenic activities on the seafloor: the case study of the taranto area, southern italy","2022","In this study, an investigation procedure for mapping the traces of anthropogenic activities on the seafloor is proposed. Analyses are based on the interpretation of acoustic data (Multibeam Echosounder and Side Scan Sonar) acquired in the Taranto coastal area. Specific GIS tools supported the acoustic data analysis, interpretation, and mapping. These analyses highlighted that the seafloor of both coastal basins included in the investigated area is affected by a high distribution of traces related to different anthropogenic activities such as dredging, shipping, and mussel farming activities. Such kind of traces resulted efficiently detectable from morpho-bathymetric acoustic data. In particular, groove traces resulted highly distributed in both basins, while sunken mussel farm facilities are widely distributed in the Mar Grande basin. The results highlight as acoustic surveys represent a useful tool for orienting effective coastal management actions. This study points out how geophysical surveys support the geo-environmental characterization of highly urbanized coastal sectors.","Multibeam Echosounder,Contaminated coastal sites,Coastal geomorphology,Side Scan Sonar,Mar Grande,Mar Piccolo,"
"a reinforcement learning development of the fram for functional reward-based assessments of complex systems performance","2022","Although the Functional Resonance Analysis Method (FRAM) is a well-established approach to visualizing complex systems' operations in terms of functions, further improvements are required to examine systems' performance through functionality. This study aims to develop an approach to couple the FRAM to reinforcement learning (RL) to explore complex operations. The developed approach is called the functional RL approach and constitutes a novel way of using a FRAM model to explore functionality using an artificial intelligent (AI) agent who responds to reward values assigned to functional parameters. To exemplify the approach, an agent is employed to perform the role of a patient and explore a functional environment generated by the FRAM. Reward values are considered to motivate the agent in order to explore the environment to achieve its objective. The ability of the developed approach is examined using different scenarios implemented in healthcare operations. The results of using the functional RL approach indicate that the approach is able to specify the functional route taken by the agent and to examine the performance of the system based on accumulated rewards. The outcomes of this study demonstrate that the developed functional RL approach provides a novel means to explore operational environments to identify the routes that have potential to affect the system performance. This method can be used as a powerful way to assess how a system performs under different management structures.","Reinforcement learning (RL),Accumulated reward,Functional resonance analysis method (FRAM),Artificial intelligent (AI) agent,Functional route exploration,"

"a study of the reduction of the regional aggregated wind power forecast error by spatial smoothing effects in the maritime canada","2010","This paper discusses the accuracy of the prediction of aggregated wind power of planned wind farms distributed in the Maritime Canada. Especially this study calculates and analyzes the aggregated regional wind power forecast error compared to single sites. Using simulated measured wind power and expected wind power from 5 planned wind farms, this research finds that the reduction of the ensemble wind power forecast error depends on the size of the region. To generate these findings, the spatial correlation function of prediction error is applied to calculate the ensemble wind forecast error based on arbitrary configurations of wind farms and wind generations, as long as the total installed wind capacity is a fixed number for selected planned wind farms. The validation of the spatial smoothing effects will provide the Maritime utilities an alternative method to reduce the regional aggregated wind power forecast errors instead of using costly wind prediction system.","spatial correlation function,wind power plants,aggregated wind power prediction,Predictive models,planned wind farms,prediction error,cost wind prediction system,regional aggregated wind power forecast error reduction,Wind speed,Wind farms,Maritime Canada,Correlation,wind generations,validation,Wind power generation,load forecasting,power generation planning,spatial smoothing effects,Aggregated wind power forecast error,correlation function,Wind forecasting,"

"the promises and perils of automatic identification system data","2021","Automatic Identification System (AIS) is used to identify vessels in maritime navigation. Currently, it is used for various commercial purposes. However, the abundance and lack of quality of AIS data make it difficult to capitalize on its value. Therefore, an understanding of both the limitations of AIS data and the opportunities is important to maximize its value, but these have not been clearly stated in the existing literature. This study aims to help researchers and practitioners understand AIS data by identifying both the promises and perils of AIS data. We identify the different applications and limitations of AIS data in the literature and build upon them in a sequential mixed-design study. We first identify the promises and perils that exist in the literature. We then analyze AIS data from the port of Amsterdam quantitatively to detect noise and to find the perils researchers and practitioners could encounter. Our results incorporate quantitative findings with qualitative insights obtained from interviewing domain experts. This study extends the literature by considering multiple limitations of AIS data across different domains at the same time. Our results show that the amount of noise in AIS data depends on factors such as the equipment used, external factors, humans, dense traffic etc. The contribution that our paper makes is in combining and making a comprehensive list of both the promises and perils of AIS data. Consequently, this study helps researchers and practitioners to (i) identify the sources of noise, (ii) to reduce the noise in AIS data and (iii) use it for the benefits of their research or the optimization of their operations.","Ship behavior analysis,Advanced applications of AIS data,Navigation safety,Environmental evaluation,Data mining,AIS data,"
"changes in heat waves in chile","2018","This research aims to examine changes in heat waves (HWs) over Chile from 1961 to 2016 using daily maximum (TX) and minimum temperature (TN) data recorded at 13 weather stations. Based on three HW-definitions and five aspects for each definition some 15 indices were calculated and analyzed for the extended summer period (November-March). The three definitions of the HWs employed in this study were based on: (1) the TX exceeding the 90th percentile for at least three consecutive days, (2) the TN exceeding the 90th percentile for at least three consecutive days, and (3) the positive values of excess heat factor (EHF) maintaining for at least three consecutive days. The five aspects calculated for each of the definitions provided information related to the frequency, duration, and intensity of HWs. Trends (be them increasing or decreasing), magnitude (change per decade) and statistical significance (p < 0.05) were identified using the ordinary least square method and the t-test. Therefore, in terms of HW aspects, the results of the HWs climate regime analysis showed that the most extreme region of Chile is the Atacama Desert, followed by the Santiago metropolitan area. Change analysis revealed that Chile experienced increasing trends in most of the HW data sets. Thus, the frequency of trend types of all HW indices time series showed an increasing trend of 79%. About 24% of the time series showed statistically significant increasing trends. Decreasing trends were found in about 20% of the analyzed data, less than 1% of which being statistically significant. Stationary trends were detected in only 2% of the series. The highest frequency of statistically significant increasing trends was found in the HWs identified based on TX, followed by those computed based on EHF. Regarding their aspects, the number of events had the highest frequency of significant increasing trends. In terms of spatial distribution, the most important changes were found in central Chile.","Heat waves,Chile,Climate change,Excess heat factor,"
"maritime ship detection method for satellite images based on multiscale feature fusion","2023","Remote sensing ship recognition technology is one of the important research areas for achieving ocean security monitoring. However, maritime ship targets features such as multiscale, arbitrary direction, and dense arrangement, and their imaging is often influenced by factors such as sea fog and sea surface background. It is challenging for fast and accurate detection of remote sensing ships. We propose a new ship detection algorithm YOLO-remote sensing ship detection (YOLO-RSSD) based on YOLOv5, which effectively improves the accuracy of ship detection while ensuring detection speed. It is attributed to our proposed four optimization measures in this model. First, the K-means++ algorithm is introduced in the data preprocessing part to improve the clustering effect and obtain candidate box sizes suitable for multiscale ship dataset. Then, an improved bidirectional feature pyramid network structure is embedded in the feature fusion part to achieve cross-layer multiscale weighted feature fusion. Third, the original bounding box regression loss function is replaced with the EIoU loss, which is effective for accelerating the convergence and improving the regression accuracy of predicted boxes. Finally, a channel attention mechanism is introduced in the convolutional unit to enhance the model's ability to capture ship features. Experimental results show that the YOLO-RSSD model achieves a detection accuracy of 96.1% for remote sensing ships, which is 4.3% higher than the original YOLOv5 network. In addition, YOLO-RSSD performs good robustness and generalization ability. This means that our method has high practical value and provides a new solution for the analysis and application of remote sensing images.","detection speed,sea surface background,YOLO-RSSD model,Remote sensing,cross-layer multiscale weighted feature fusion,remote sensing,ship detection,Adaptively spatial feature fusion,Marine vehicles,ship features,multiscale ship dataset,Feature extraction,channel attention mechanism,improved bidirectional feature pyramid network structure,regression analysis,geophysical image processing,candidate box sizes,detection accuracy,Target recognition,Optical sensors,ships,original bounding box regression loss function,remote sensing ship recognition technology,Image recognition,remote sensing images,object detection,feature extraction,image classification,small target detection,optical satellite remote sensing image,ship detection algorithm YOLO-remote sensing ship detection,convolutional unit,YOLOv5,feature fusion part,convolutional neural nets,multiscale feature fusion,fast detection,arbitrary direction,Object detection,maritime ship detection method,sea fog,"

"data fusion and machine learning for industrial prognosis: trends and perspectives towards industry 4.0","2019","The so-called “smartization” of manufacturing industries has been conceived as the fourth industrial revolution or Industry 4.0, a paradigm shift propelled by the upsurge and progressive maturity of new Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) applied to industrial processes and products. From a data science perspective, this paradigm shift allows extracting relevant knowledge from monitored assets through the adoption of intelligent monitoring and data fusion strategies, as well as by the application of machine learning and optimization methods. One of the main goals of data science in this context is to effectively predict abnormal behaviors in industrial machinery, tools and processes so as to anticipate critical events and damage, eventually causing important economical losses and safety issues. In this context, data-driven prognosis is gradually gaining attention in different industrial sectors. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of the recent developments in data fusion and machine learning for industrial prognosis, placing an emphasis on the identification of research trends, niches of opportunity and unexplored challenges. To this end, a principled categorization of the utilized feature extraction techniques and machine learning methods will be provided on the basis of its intended purpose: analyze what caused the failure (descriptive), determine when the monitored asset will fail (predictive) or decide what to do so as to minimize its impact on the industry at hand (prescriptive). This threefold analysis, along with a discussion on its hardware and software implications, intends to serve as a stepping stone for future researchers and practitioners to join the community investigating on this vibrant field.","Industry 4.0,Machine learning,Data-driven prognosis,Data fusion,"
"inter-annual variability of net and gross ecosystem carbon fluxes: a review","2018","As the lifetime of regional flux networks approach twenty years, there is a growing number of papers that have published long term records (5 years or more) of net carbon fluxes between ecosystems and the atmosphere. Unanswered questions from this body of work are: 1) how variable are carbon fluxes on a year to year basis?; 2) what are the biophysical factors that may cause interannual variability and/or temporal trends in carbon fluxes?; and 3) how does the biophysical control on this carbon flux variability differ by climate and ecological spaces? To address these questions, we surveyed published data from 59 sites that reported on five or more years of continuous measurements, yielding 544 site-years of data. We found that the standard deviation of the interannual variability in net ecosystem carbon exchange (162gCm−2y−1) is large relative to its population mean (−200gCm−2 y−1). Broad-leaved evergreen forests and crops experienced the greatest absolute variability in interannual net carbon exchange (greater than ±300gCm−2y−1) and boreal evergreen forests and maritime wetlands were among the least variable (less than  ±40 gCm−2y−1). A disproportionate fraction of the yearly variability in net ecosystem exchange was associated with biophysical factors that modulated ecosystem photosynthesis rather than ecosystem respiration. Yet, there was appreciable and statistically significant covariance between ecosystem photosynthesis and respiration. Consequently, biophysical conditions that conspired to increase ecosystem photosynthesis to from one year to the next were associated with an increase in ecosystem respiration, and vice versa; on average, the year to year change in respiration was 40% as large as the year to year change in photosynthesis. The analysis also identified sets of ecosystems that are on the verge of switching from being carbon sinks to carbon sources. These include sites in the Arctic tundra, the evergreen forests in the Pacific northwest and some grasslands, where year to year changes in respiration are outpacing those in photosynthesis. While a select set of climatic and ecological factors (e.g. light, rainfall, temperature, phenology) played direct and indirect roles on this variability, their impact differed conditionally, as well as by climate and ecological spaces. For example, rainfall had both positive and negative effects. Deficient rainfall caused a physiological decline in photosynthesis in temperate and semi-arid regions. Too much rain, in the humid tropics, limited photosynthesis by limiting light. In peatlands and tundra, excess precipitation limited ecosystem respiration when it raised the water table to the surface. For deciduous forests, warmer temperatures lengthened the growing season, increasing photosynthesis, but this effect also increased soil respiration. Finally, statistical analysis was performed to evaluate the detection limit of trends; we computed the confidence intervals of trends in multi-year carbon fluxes that need to be resolved to conclude whether the differences are to be attributed to randomness or biophysical forcings. Future studies and reports on interannual variations need to consider the role of the duration of the time series on random errors when quantifying potential trends and extreme events.","Eddy covariance,Net ecosystem exchange,Carbon cycle,FLUXNET,"

The waters were analyzed for twenty variables including ten gases and five trace elements. The dissolved gases give information on subsurface chemical and geological environments. Carbon dioxide highs occur at the contact of granites and limestones; He highs are along major faults; CH4 and H2S reveal strongly reducing environments, and O2 in wells indicates shallow wells or active water turnover. Rn reveals U mineralization and granitic rocks. The South March U-Cu surface occurrence gives coincident U, Cu, Zn, Pb and Rn highs. A weak U-Rn-Cu high in the Richmond-North Gower area suggests more radioactive subcropping March formation there. A strong regional He anomaly coincident with the outcropping Rockcliffe Formation and controlled by the Hazeldean Fault is believed to be due to deep-seated He, but its coincidence with a weak regional Cu anomaly, a Rn anomaly in the Bells Corners area, its linear northeast trend, the presence of Helikian U-rich source rocks to the southwest, and northeast-dipping Paleozoic sandstones provide both indications of, and the right environment for epigenetic type U-Cu occurrences.",""

"impact of covid-19 on china's international liner shipping network based on ais data","2022","As an essential sub-network of the global liner shipping network, China's international liner shipping network was the earliest to be affected by the COVID-19 and also had a significant impact on the global shipping network. This paper uses Automatic Identification System (AIS) data to analyze the impact of COVID-19 on the typical route networks and major ports of China's international liner shipping. On this basis, the changes in network efficiency and connectivity under the failure of important nodes is simulated. The research finds that, during the epidemic period, the scale of China's international liner shipping network increased, with more routes gathering at fewer hub ports. Still, the overall connectivity and connection strength declined. Meanwhile, the epidemic caused fluctuations in container volume and the mismatch of ship cargo capacity supply, in which China-U.S. routes was the most prominent. From the view of node, the competitiveness of China's mainland ports was significantly promoted during the epidemic. In addition, ports such as Busan, Singapore, and Hong Kong substantially impacted China's international liner shipping network. The current study might be helpful for the industry management departments and related companies to prepare contingency plans, thus enhancing the resilience of the logistics chain and ensuring the stability of the global supply chain.","China's international liner shipping network,Complex network,Automatic identification system (AIS),COVID-19,"
"dltif: deep learning-driven cyber threat intelligence modeling and identification framework in iot-enabled maritime transportation systems","2023","The recent burgeoning of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies in the maritime industry is successfully digitalizing Maritime Transportation Systems (MTS). In IoT-enabled MTS, the smart maritime objects, infrastructure associated with ship or port communicate wirelessly using an open channel Internet. The intercommunication and incorporation of heterogeneous technologies in IoT-enabled MTS brings opportunities not only for the industries that embrace it, but also for cyber-criminals. Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) is an effective security strategy that uses artificial intelligence models to understand cyber-attacks and can protect data of IoT-enabled MTS proficiently. Unsurprisingly, most of the existing CTI-based solutions uses manual analysis to extract relevant threat information, and has low detection and high false alarm rate. Therefore, to tackle aforementioned challenges, an automated framework called DLTIF is developed for modeling cyber threat intelligence and identifying threat types. The proposed DLTIF is based on three schemes: a deep feature extractor (DFE), CTI-driven detection (CTIDD) and CTI-attack type identification (CTIATI). The DFE scheme automatically extracts the hidden patterns of IoT-enabled MTS network and its output is used by CTIDD scheme for threat detection. The CTIATI scheme is designed to identify the exact threat types and to assist security analysts in giving early warning and adopt defensive strategies.

"potential impact of long-life environmental sonobuoys on littoral asw","2009","The focus of military activity has recently shifted from large area engagements to regional conflicts. Consequently, supportive Naval maritime operations have continued to evolve toward littoral warfare in complicated shallow-water, near-shore environments. This evolution requires new sensors, advanced Concept of Operations, and improved data-analysis capabilities, among others. Planning operations in these harsh-environment areas is difficult because accurate predictions of tactical sensor performance depend on detailed knowledge of the local environmental conditions. Tactical mission planning is thus seldom optimal or efficient, often resulting in coverage gaps, increased risk, and reduced mission success. According to a Navy Mission Need Statement, 'Air ASW tactical execution, especially in littoral seas, requires in-situ environmental updates for preflight mission planning. In the conduct of ASW operations, an urgent need for explicit knowledge of environmental variables is required to optimize the effectiveness of operational acoustic sensors, as well as acoustic sensors in development ' The Naval Air Systems Command has considered extended-life environmental sonobuoy concepts to better characterize the littoral environment. Most designs contain a thermistor string to measure ocean temperatures and also hydrophones to measure ambient noise. This type of complex sonobuoy would be more expensive than a traditional single-measurement AXBT but it could provide a more thorough littoral environment assessment. This paper examines the trade-off between increased sensor complexity and improved ASW performance, in terms of cumulative detection probability. Some advantages of an extended-life combined thermistor string/hydrophone approach, compared to AXBTs and tactical hydrophones, are: 1) higher accuracy of the raw data; 2) temporal averaging to smooth out fluctuations; 3) extended area coverage during drift; 4) less chance for surface temperature anomalies (e.g., mixed-layer-depth errors) caused by various electronic and mechanical variability upon impact; 5) opportunities to discover thermal and acoustic feature boundaries during drift; and 6) less need to re-seed thus allowing longer tactical mission times. These advantages are evaluated relative to the following disadvantages: 1) increased cost; 2) potential drift outside the mission area; and 3) need for increased battery life for longer durations. The analysis is tempered by considering how a potential new system might be used. One assumption is that an environmental sampling decision aid is available to determine the minimum number and best initial locations of drifting sensors to meet performance objectives. The November 2007 Requirements Document from the Naval Oceanographic Office states ?Sampling guidance: Development of guidance on the best way to deploy, spatially and temporally, observation systems in order to meet various forecasting, model assimilation, and model evaluation objectives is needed.? Work in this area is reported in this Oceans '09 Conference in a paper entitled ?Uncertainty-based Adaptive AXBT Sampling with SPOTS?, which addresses optimal sampling requirements. For this trade-off analysis, temperature data from watersampling flights in the Sea of Japan off the east coast of Korea were used to simulate expected capability of a long-term drifting thermistor string. Then optimal initial positions for three notional buoys were determined followed by a simulation of drifting positions and data collected over 12 days. Ocean nowcasts were constructed and used to determine acoustic performance of a notional tactical sonobuoy field. The analysis shows that a drifting extended-life thermistor string can provide significant improvement in environmental characterization, tactical planning, and ASW detection performance.","Acoustic measurements,Sea measurements,military systems,Predictive models,Sonar equipment,Sampling methods,Ocean temperature,Noise measurement,littoral ASW,operational acoustic sensors,Thermistors,Temperature measurement,Acoustic sensors,long-life environmental sonobuoys,"
"chemical condition and surface ozone in large cities of texas during the last decade: observational evidence from omi, cams, and model analysis","2015","This paper presents a long-term (2005–2013) analysis of tropospheric NO2 and HCHO using the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) satellite and surface ozone using the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ)'s Continuous Ambient Monitoring Stations (CAMS) sites in large cities of Texas. Rather than focusing solely on seasonal changes, the authors consider other harmonic changes using Least Squares Harmonic Estimation (LS-HE), which reduces uncertainty in trends by 5–15%. Tropospheric NO2 observed from OMI demonstrated a downward trend in Austin (−0.06±0.02×1015 molecules cm−2yr−1), Dallas (−0.21±0.04×1015 molecules cm−2yr−1), Fort Worth (−0.16±0.04×1015 molecules cm−2yr−1), Houston (−0.14±0.05×1015 molecules cm−2yr−1), and San Antonio (−0.07±0.02×1015 molecules cm−2yr−1). These decreasing trends could be attributed to efficient emission control policies. The OMI HCHO observations exhibited both negative and positive annual trends in Austin (+0.09±0.05×1015 molecules cm−2yr−1), Dallas (−0.01±0.04×1015 molecules cm−2yr−1), Fort Worth (−0.04±0.04×1015 molecules cm−2yr−1), Houston (−0.06±0.05×1015 molecules cm−2yr−1), and San Antonio (+0.01±0.03×1015 molecules cm−2yr−1) mainly resulting from differences in decreases in anthropogenic emissions, the impact of climatic variations and biogenic emissions. The discrepancy between the annual trends of HCHO and NO2 provides strong evidence that all of the cities gradually became more NOx-sensitive. We obtained the slope of HCHO/NO2 ratios (a proxy for chemical condition) from OMI for Austin (0.10±0.04yr−1), Dallas (0.08±0.03yr−1), Fort Worth (0.07±0.03yr−1), Houston (0.06±0.03yr−1), and San Antonio (0.08±0.03yr−1) and investigate the 1–2pm local time surface ozone patterns along with maximum, annual, and minimum trends in relation to changes in their precursors and prevailing chemical conditions. The surface levels of wintertime ozone measured by the CAMS network were seen to increase in Austin (0.90±0.53ppbvyr−1), Dallas (0.62±0.53ppbvyr−1), Fort Worth (0.59±0.40ppbvyr−1), Houston (0.56±0.55ppbvyr−1), and San Antonio (0.64±0.54ppbvyr−1) because of the reduction in the amount of ozone quenched through NOx titration. Summertime ozone surface mixing ratio trends are mainly governed by NO2 annual trends as well as climatic influences. We obtained the downward annual trend of the ozone mixing ratio from CAMS observations for Austin (−0.27±0.17ppbvyr−1), Dallas (−0.41±0.18ppbvyr−1), Fort Worth (−0.55±0.18ppbvyr−1), Houston (−0.53±0.18ppbvyr−1), and San Antonio (−0.03±0.16ppbvyr−1). The results show that prevailing chemical conditions control the annual trends of surface ozone. While Austin and San Antonio exhibited similar declines in OMI NO2 levels, a more prevailing NOx-sensitive regime over Austin resulted in its greater sensitivity to NO2 changes. The dominant NOx-saturated regime over Dallas, however, led to its lower sensitivity to high annual downward trends of OMI NO2. To investigate the impact of reductions in ozone precursors on surface ozone, we employ the WRF-Chem regional model to simulate NO2, HCHO, and O3 levels in September 2013 in two scenarios using National Emissions Inventory 2005 (NEI-2005) and NEI-2011 anthropogenic emissions. The model describes a decrease in ozone levels from the first to second scenario in Dallas (3%) and Forth Worth (0.5%) but an increase in Austin, San Antonio, and Houston (0.7%, 0.8%, and 7%, respectively), which may be attributed to uncertainty in VOC concentrations and overestimation of NOx in the NEI-2005 inventory that led to inaccurate HCHO/NO2 ratios. The results indicate that the emission uncertainties should be constrained to better inform emissions control policy based on air quality modeling.","Chemical condition,Formaldehyde,Ozone,Nitrogen dioxide,Trend analysis,"

"contribution of anthropogenic and natural sources in pm10 during north african dust events in southern europe","2021","The influence of North African (NAF) dust events on the air quality at the regional level (12 representative monitoring stations) in Southern Europe during a long time series (2007–2014) was studied. PM10 levels and chemical composition were separated by Atlantic (ATL) and NAF air masses. An increase in the average PM10 concentrations was observed on sampling days with NAF dust influence (42 μg m−3) when compared to ATL air masses (29 μg m−3). Major compounds such as crustal components and secondary inorganic compounds (SIC), as well as toxic trace elements derived from industrial emissions, also showed higher concentrations of NAF events. A source contribution analysis using positive matrix factorisation (PMF) 5.0 of the PM10 chemical data, discriminating ATL and NAF air mass origins, allowed the identification of five sources: crustal, sea salt, traffic, regional, and industrial. A higher contribution (74%) of the natural sources to PM10 concentrations was confirmed under NAF episodes compared with ATL. Furthermore, there was an increase in anthropogenic sources during these events (51%), indicating the important influence of the NAF air masses on these sources. The results of this study highlight that environmental managers should take appropriate actions to reduce local emissions during NAF events to ensure good air quality.","PM10,Source contribution,North African dust,Southern Europe,"
"microwave wireless coordination technologies for coherent distributed maritime radar","2017","Developments in communications and networking have enabled separate microwave wireless systems to coordinate at increasingly detailed levels, creating a path towards distributed wireless systems. Coherent distributed arrays, where the individual wireless systems synchronize at the level of the RF carrier phase, achieve transmit power gains on the order of the number of platforms squared, and receive gains proportional to the number of platforms. For radar applications, an array with N elements yields an overall system gain of N3 in the far field of the array, providing a significant improvement in radar sensitivity. This paper analyzes improved detection capabilities for surface maritime radars operating coherently, and discusses technologies for achieving coherent gain.

"the b parameter in the betic cordillera, rif and nearby sectors. relations with the tectonics of the region","1995","The a and b parameters of the Gutenberg-Richter ratio for intensities and magnitudes are evaluated according to the methods of calculation, treatment and quality of the data used. When these variability factors have been controlled by the corresponding confidence indices, the mean values of these parameters are used to regionalise the Iberian-Maghreb area as regards shallow and intermediate seismicity. Analysis of the various sectors under consideration (seismic groupings, differentiated seismic sources in the Betic Cordillera, crustal domains and lithospheric domains) provides values of the afore-mentioned parameters coherent with the known tectonic evolution of this area. We also show that the b parameter is not reliable for small-size seismic sources because of the poor statistical representativity of the sample (very few years for small regions). The b parameter values obtained for both crustal and lithospheric domains are remarkably similar and can be linked with what is to be expected in highly fractured sectors. This supports the hypotheses that explain the existence of intermediate seismicity by movement of faults cutting almost the entire lithosphere, or even by the possible presence of a zone of incipient subduction.",""

"advection pathways at the mt. cimone wmo-gaw station: seasonality, trends, and influence on atmospheric composition","2020","Relationships are analysed between advection pathways and atmospheric composition at the high-mountain station of Mt. Cimone (Italy), between 1998 and 2011. Back-trajectory cluster analysis identifies eight main advection pathways. A connection is demonstrated between the seasonality of airmass transport and atmospheric composition. Temporal trends and correlation of variables, flow types and teleconnection indices show, among other, decreasing trends of 210Pb (a radionuclide of crustal origin; −0.008 mBq m−3 year−1) as well as PM10 (−0.15 μg m−3 year−1), indicating that previously observed downward PM10 trends in Europe may actually be attributable to a combination of meteorological factors and decreasing anthropogenic emissions. The detection of a positive (negative) correlation of these tracers with Western (Arctic) air masses, showing significant downward (upward) trends at the study site, further confirms our findings. Lastly, relationships between teleconnection indices and atmospheric transport types/atmospheric variables are further analysed, focusing on large-scale atmospheric circulation indices and regional low-frequency atmospheric circulation pathways, the Mediterranean Oscillation and the Western Mediterranean Oscillation. The analysis reveals the important influence of such regional indices on the advection pathways.","Atmospheric radiotracers,Aerosol,Back-trajectories,Teleconnection,Trends,"

History shows us that any collision involving a marine craft can have a devastating effect both on human life and the environment. Presented here is a method for the statistical characterization of the sea present in an image and the subsequent segmentation of the image into two regions, sea and object. The characterization process uses statistical measures on histogram data collected from various regions of the image. This leads to a characteristic grey-level range that represents the 'sea'. The grey-level statistics are then used to segment the image into regions that contain sea. The methods introduced here have been shown to work well with images containing differing sized objects with differing sea conditions and levels of illumination.","imaging system,image recognition,human life,Marine vehicles,Road accidents,maritime vessels,grey-level statistics,History,statistical analysis,maritime image segmentation,marine craft,Optical reflection,ships,Containers,illumination level,Humans,object detection,Image segmentation,Histograms,Radar imaging,image segmentation,collision avoidance,Videoconference,histogram data analysis,sea statistical characterization,"
"centennial glacier retreat increases sedimentation and eutrophication in subantarctic periglacial lakes: a study case of lake uruguay","2021","High resolution XRF scanning documented inter-annual paleolimnological changes of a Subantarctic periglacial lake, during a process of centennial glacier retreat in King George Island, Antarctica. Two major paleoenvironmental stages were inferred from the combined analysis of elemental, molecular and isotopic biomarkers, with a boundary or transition set at about 3200 yr BP. The first stage was characterized by a relatively low allochthonous organic content, reduced productivity and nitrogen levels. Such paleoenvironmental conditions are interpreted as a terrestrial system under periglacial influence, where material influx was related to erosion process from the melt water discharge, because of the proximity to the Collins Glacier ice cap. After the major Holocene glacier advance dated at about 3500 yr BP, the ice cap retreat led to the formation of Lake Uruguay, which involved in filling processes leading to moraine deposits, proglacial meltwater channels, and lakes next to the land glacier. During the second stage, with the onset of the Current Warm Period, prior to 1900 CE the stabilization of the Zr/Rb ratio within the laminated sediments documented the origin of the lacustrine sedimentation system, with subsequent increases in the sedimentation rate and biomass content (total nitrogen and organic carbon). Time series analyses revealed that the lake displayed variability cycles related to El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), as reflected by high resolution sedimentological proxies for grain size, weathering, allochthonous inputs from the watershed, increase of biomass and productivity, and changes in redox conditions, all of which displayed similar oscillation cycles from 2 to 6 yr. During this periglacial recession and associated eutrophication process, we detected a striking loss in both bacterial specific richness and diversity as inferred from preliminary selected ancient DNA analyses. Thus, the Antarctic warming scenario leading to glacier depletion appears to exert deterioration consequences on the Subantarctic microbial web.","Lipid biomarkers,Paleolimnology,Ancient DNA,Antarctica,XRF-scanning,"
"a method for maritime target tracking based on kernelized spectral filter","2022","Maritime target tracking can be applied in the fields of intelligent marine transportation and resource protection. The spectral filter tracking method focuses on the adaptability of the local appearance changes of targets, with the graph representation. Considering the complexity and diversity of the marine environment, we propose a maritime target tracking algorithm based on kernelized spectral filter. The spectral filtering is modeled as a tracking framework based on kernel regression. According to graph signal processing and spectral graph theory, based on the description of kernel regression on graph signals, we deduce and discuss the construction of the filter, the calculation of kernel matrix, the solution of kernel regression model, and the prediction of tracking position. With the help of a nonlinear model, it can effectively improve the precision under complex tracking conditions. The experimental results on the benchmark dataset verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, especially when the target tracking is affected by waves or wakes.","graph representation,graph signal processing,matrix algebra,Feature extraction,intelligent transportation systems,kernel regression,Predictive models,regression analysis,kernel matrix,Filtering algorithms,Filtering,target tracking,position tracking,Target tracking,spectral filter tracking method,particle filtering (numerical methods),kernelized spectral filter,Signal processing,graph theory,kernel regression model,spectral graph theory,resource protection,spectral filtering,Signal processing algorithms,maritime target tracking,intelligent marine transportation,"

"diapycnal diffusivity in the core and oxycline of the tropical north atlantic oxygen minimum zone","2016","Diapycnal diffusivity estimates from two Tracer Release Experiments (TREs) and microstructure measurements in the oxycline and core of the oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) in the Eastern Tropical North Atlantic (ETNA) are compared. For the first time, two TREs within the same area at different depths were realized: the Guinea Upwelling Tracer Release Experiment (GUTRE) initiated in 2008 in the oxycline at approximately 320m depth, and the Oxygen Supply Tracer Release Experiment (OSTRE) initiated in 2012 in the core of the OMZ at approximately 410m depth. The mean diapycnal diffusivity Dz was found to be insignificantly smaller in the OMZ core with (1.06±0.24)×10−5m2s−1 compared to (1.11±0.22)×10−5m2s−1 90m shallower in the oxycline. Unexpectedly, GUTRE tracer was detected during two of the OSTRE surveys which showed that the estimated diapycnal diffusivity from GUTRE over a time period of seven years was within the uncertainty of the previous estimates over a time period of three years. The results are consistent with the Dz estimates from microstructure measurements and demonstrate that Dz does not vary significantly vertically in the OMZ within the depth range of 200–600m and does not change with time. The presence of a seamount chain in the vicinity of the GUTRE injection region did not cause enhanced Dz compared to the smoother bottom topography of the OSTRE injection region, although the analysis of vertical shear spectra from ship ADCP data showed elevated internal wave energy level in the seamount vicinity. However, the two tracer patches covered increasingly overlapping areas with time and thus spatially integrated increasingly similar fields of local diffusivity, as well as the difference in local stratification counteracted the influence of roughness on Dz. For both experiments no significant vertical displacements of the tracer were observed, thus diapycnal upwelling within the ETNA OMZ is below the uncertainty level of 5myr−1.","Tropical Atlantic,Guinea Dome,Tracers,Diffusion coefficients,Upwelling,Oxygen minimum zone,Ventilation,"

"framework for ship trajectory forecasting based on linear stationary models using automatic identification system","2022","Maritime surveillance is of utmost priority for a nation's security, and hence it's economy. For maritime awareness, coastal surveillance, and maritime activities in the Region of Interest (ROI) should be monitored. One of the ways to keep this in check is to restrain unwanted infiltration. Monitoring unwanted infiltration is feasible through vessel trajectory forecasting and anomaly detection in real time. Most solutions for trajectory predictions are available but require a huge amount of historical data, and high-power computing resources. Here, the requirement is developing a decision support framework consisting of both lite weight approaches for short-term predictions and deep learning-based techniques for long-term forecasting. This paper aims to find the suitability of Linear Stationary Models (LSM) like the Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average Model (ARIMA) for predicting and forecasting the Vessel Trajectory as means of lite weight short-term predictions. For this purpose, the Automatic Identification System (AIS) dataset of the U.S. West Coast is used. The significant effort was for data pre-processing to create a robust dataset for model training. An appropriate model after the model-selection process is used for trajectory forecasting. The model's accuracy is validated using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) performance indices for residual and forecast errors. A window generator model is integrated with the best-fitted ARIMA model for recursive real-time predictions, with varied sizes and visualization. The proposed time-series model provided a very high accuracy as the RMSE value for prediction and 48 hours forecast are 0.023 and 0.017, respectively.","Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average Model,Window Generator,Trajectory Forecast,Time Series Analysis,Automatic Identification System,Maritime Surveillance,"
"a geospatial hub to support wind energy and maritime activity spaces near hampton roads, virginia, u.s.a.","2022","The urgent need for clean, sustainable energy development prompts the Commonwealth of Virginia (U.S.A.) to support the development of wind energy in state and federal waters. The port of Hampton Roads is a vital region for maritime commerce, recreation, and national defense, and the state also aims to avert wind development impacts on national security. This project assessed the state of marine geodata portals and decisionsupport methods for wind energy siting and developed a solution to inform energy developers, military stakeholders, and state and local government. An interdisciplinary team developed a user experience (UX) design approach to the problem, gathering persona-driven requirements and designing, prototyping, and testing a solution. Extensive geospatial wind resource data, energy infrastructure, shore and maritime air and vessel activity, protected lands, energy grid connections, and administrative processes are integrated in a web-based solution to screen and assess compatibility. This paper highlights Geographic Information Systems (GIS) used to provide decision support for site suitability analysis of offshore wind energy potential. With a focus on military use spaces, the project sought to gather publicly available activity spaces and areas of critical concern to military siting. We also integrated the newest available maritime vessel traffic activity from AIS data. A user-driven design is applied with GIS data that incorporates the diverse variability of energy, jurisdictional, and potential activity use space conflicts of an increasingly busy maritime environment. The approach taken in this project demonstrates that UX can support the range of developers, regulators, and maritime space users. The WindsiteVA hub spans onshore as well as offshore and nearshore (state waters and the Chesapeake Bay). Spatial analyses include several webmap capabilities, a library of basemaps, site exploration and coordinate conversion tools, reporting tools, and metadata and external data resources. Users are guided through pathways unique to personas: Developers, government agency personnel, or military personnel. As a â€œone-stop toolâ€ the webbased site is accessible publicly and utilizes Esri ArcGIS Hub technology. The site steps users through critical processes and data elements, such as informal queries, Notice of Proposed Construction for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), VA Department of Environmental Quality Permit by Rule (PBR), the US Department of Defense siting clearinghouse, and other procedures. Results suggest improved spatial decision-making and marine spatial planning can be achieved at minimal cost by combining UX design and geospatial hub technology. Wind resource development around seaports can be optimized and spatial conflicts reduced, costs lowered, and cumulative impacts identified. WindSiteVA captures complex processes and major concerns for wind energy availability and military concerns, yet it is not redundant with other policies or rules nor does it reflect sitescale reviews such as environmental impact assessments. Early results of WindSiteVA show that a screening-level approach can assist wind energy developers in coastal inshore and offshore waters, where relatively abundant wind energy resources exist, and reduce impacts to military and national defense and other maritime activities.","decision support systems,maritime vessel traffic activity,maritime commerce,wind energy availability,user experience design,vessel activity,web-based solution,government agency personnel,WindSiteVA captures complex process,Costs,maritime space users,Geospatial analysis,administrative process,wind energy siting,maritime activity spaces,UX design,extensive geospatial wind resource data,wind energy developers,webbased site,maritime air,military concerns,offshore waters,Hampton Roads,Esri ArcGIS Hub technology,local government,wind development impacts,persona-driven requirements,Virginia,clean energy development,wind energy resources,maritime activity space,military stakeholders,environmental impact assessments,Seaports,offshore wind energy potential,sustainable energy development,military personnel,Wind energy,Wind,busy maritime environment,external data resources,military siting,site suitability analysis,user-driven design,offshore installations,geographic information systems,wind power,publicly available activity spaces,military use spaces,national defense,US Department of Defense,Roads,Federal Aviation Administration,offshore wind,GIS data,geospatial hub,geographic information system,national security,energy grid connections,federal waters,wind resource development,WindsiteVA hub,energy infrastructure,maritime activities,site suitability,marine geodata portals,informal queries,AIS data,screening-level approach,FAA,"

This paper explores a novel approach to representing spatiotemporal data for model-driven methods for detecting patterns of anomalous behaviour in spatiotemporal datasets.","security of data,maritime security,Data models,Educational institutions,maritime domain,Probability density function,Spatiotemporal phenomena,data volume,marine engineering,spatiotemporal data,Bayesian methods,anomaly detection,Security,Abstracts,"
"demonstrating the effect of exposure to nature on happy facial expressions via flickr data: advantages of non-intrusive social network data analyses and geoinformatics methodologies","2018","Although the role of exposure to nature (ETN) in improving well-being was previously demonstrated, most of the existing research is derived from self-report measures. Conversely, geoinformatics methodologies are seldom used. To address this gap, we examined the prevalence of happy facial expressions (HFE) in natural settings such as water bodies, green vegetation, and undeveloped areas. We applied a novel, spatio-temporal analysis of photos taken in the Boston area and posted on Flickr – a location-based social network – during 2012–2015 (N = 60,013). Photos were analyzed using Microsoft Emotion API to detect facial expressions. ETN, measured either as a composite score, or based on the three aforementioned aspects, was significantly associated with HFEs, even after controlling for temporal patterns. An exploratory visualization of spatial clusters characterized by high HFE proportion was in agreement with the statistical results. This method can be used to explore human-environment interactions more explicitly in a non-intrusive manner.",""
"monitoring the algerian basin through glider observations, satellite altimetry and numerical simulations along a saral/altika track","2018","The Algerian Basin is a key component of the general circulation in the Western Mediterranean Sea. The presence of both fresh Atlantic water and more saline Mediterranean water gives the basin an intense inflow/outflow regime and complex circulation patterns. Energetic mesoscale structures that evolve from meanders of the Algerian Current into isolated cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies dominate the area, with marked repercussions on biological activity. Despite its remarkable importance, this region and its variability are still poorly known and basin-wide knowledge of its meso- and submesoscale features is still incomplete. Studying such complex processes requires a synergistic approach that involves integrated observing systems. In recent years, several studies have demonstrated the advantages of combined use of autonomous underwater vehicles, such as gliders, with a new generation of satellite altimetry. In this context, we present results of an observational program conducted in the Algerian Basin during fall 2014 and 2015 that aimed to advance our knowledge of its main features. The study was carried out through analysis of high resolution glider observations, collected along the Algerian BAsin Circulation Unmanned Survey (ABACUS) chokepoint, in synergy with co-located SARAL/AltiKa altimetric products and CMEMS numerical simulations. Results show that glider-derived dynamic height and SARAL/AltiKa absolute dynamic topography have similar patterns, with RMS of the differences ranging between 1.11 and 2.90 cm. Even though larger discrepancies are observed near the Balearic and Algerian coasts, correlation coefficients between glider and satellite observations seem mostly to be affected by reduced synopticity between the measurements. Glider observations acquired during the four surveys reveal the presence of several water masses of Atlantic and Mediterranean origin (i.e., AW and LIW at different modification levels) with marked seasonal variability.","Algerian Basin,CMEMS models,Satellite altimetry,Glider observations,SARAL-AltiKa along track data,"
"a real-time data-driven framework for the identification of steady states of marine machinery","2022","While maritime transportation is the primary means of long-haul transportation of goods to and from the EU, it continues to present a significant number of casualties and fatalities owing to damage to ship equipment; damage attributed to machinery failures during daily ship operations. Therefore, the implementation of state-of-the-art inspection and maintenance activities are of paramount importance to adequately ensure the proper functioning of systems. Accordingly, Internet of Ships paradigm has emerged to guarantee the interconnectivity of maritime objects. Such technology is still in its infancy, and thus several challenges need to be addressed. An example of which is data preparation, critical to ensure data quality while avoiding biased results in further analysis to enhance transportation operations. As part of developing a real-time intelligent system to assist with instant decision-making strategies that enhance ship and systems availability, operability, and profitability, a data-driven framework for the identification of steady states of marine machinery based on image generation and connected component analysis is proposed. The identification of such states is of preeminent importance, as non-operational states may adversely alter the results outlined. A case study of three diesel generators of a tanker ship is introduced to validate the developed framework. Results of this study demonstrated the outperformance of the proposed model in relation to the widely implemented clustering models k-means and GMMs with EM algorithm. As such, the proposed framework can adequately identify steady states appropriately to guarantee the detection of such states in real-time, whilst ensuring computational efficiency and model effectiveness.","Marine machinery,Maritime transportation,Connected component analysis,Smart maintenance,Markov chains,Steady states identification,"
"major storm periods and climate forcing in the western mediterranean during the late holocene","2015","Big storm events represent a major risk for populations and infrastructures settled on coastal lowlands. In the Western Mediterranean, where human societies colonized and occupied the coastal areas since the Ancient times, the variability of storm activity for the past three millennia was investigated with a multi-proxy sedimentological and geochemical study from a lagoonal sequence. Mappings of the geochemistry and magnetic susceptibility of detrital sources in the watershed of the lagoon and from the coastal barriers were undertaken in order to track the terrestrial or coastal/marine origin of sediments deposited into the lagoon. The multi-proxy analysis shows that coarser material, low magnetic susceptibility, and high strontium content characterize the sedimentological signature of the paleostorm levels identified in the lagoonal sequence. A comparison with North Atlantic and Western Mediterranean paleoclimate proxies shows that the phases of high storm activity occurred during cold periods, suggesting a climatically-controlled mechanism for the occurrence of these storm periods. Besides, an in-phase storm activity pattern is found between the Western Mediterranean and Northern Europe. Spectral analyses performed on the Sr content revealed a new 270-year solar-driven pattern of storm cyclicity. For the last 3000 years, this 270-year cycle defines a succession of ten major storm periods (SP) with a mean duration of 96 ± 54 yr. Periods of higher storm activity are recorded from >680 to 560 cal yr BC (SP10, end of the Iron Age Cold Period), from 140 to 820 cal yr AD (SP7 to SP5) with a climax of storminess between 400 and 800 cal yr AD (Dark Ages Cold Period), and from 1230 to >1800 cal yr AD (SP3 to SP1, Little Ice Age). Periods of low storm activity occurred from 560 cal yr BC to 140 cal yr AD (SP9 and SP8, Roman Warm Period) and from 820 to 1230 cal yr AD (SP4, Medieval Warm Period).","Storminess activity,Climate forcing,Late Holocene,Solar activity,Lagoonal sequence,Western Mediterranean,"
"maritime precipitation distributions determined from airborne radar and multi-frequency radiometric measurements","1994","The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission, TRMM, satellite will carry the first rain measuring radar in space with microwave radiometers. To support the development of the TRMM, measurements from nadir viewing airborne radars and microwave radiometers were analyzed to develop algorithms to retrieve precipitation mass distributions. The present retrieval algorithm used a three layer model. In the lower layer, the algorithm used a modification of the Hitschfeld-Bordan radar equation to find the rain distribution. A cloud physics model was used to describe the melting process of the hydrometeors in the middle layer. The refractive indices of the melting and frozen hydrometeors were derived from Maxwell-Garnet theory applied to air and ice in the upper layer and air, ice and water mixtures in the melting layer. Spherical raindrops, spheres consisting of ice and air to represent graupel and hail, disks containing ice and air to represent snow dendrites and ice cylinders to represent needles at the cloud tops were assumed in the scattering computations. A backward Monte-Carlo radiative transfer model was applied to the horizontally and vertically inhomogeneous model clouds to compute the brightness temperatures that emerged from these clouds. The distributions of computed 10 GHz radar reflectivity factors, and brightness temperatures were optimized to the corresponding measurements by applying Marquardt's non-linear least squares minimization to precipitation model parameters. The algorithm yielded the distribution of the precipitation mass density along a flight path that passed over Typhoon Flo in 1990. The resulting model was validated by comparing the measured and the modeled distributions of the 35 GHz effective radar reflectivity factors and modeled and measured 192 GHz brightness temperatures.<>","airborne radar,three layer model,remote sensing,rain,spaceborne radar remote sensing,microwave radiometry,multi-frequency radiometry,algorithm,radar applications,EHF mm wave millimetric,Clouds,measurement technique,Radar measurements,Radiometers,SHF,Marquardt,rain rainfall,radiometry,marine atmosphere,Brightness temperature,Maxwell-Garnet theory,meteorological radar,Hitschfeld-Bordan radar equation,microwave measurement,Airborne radar,mass distribution,minimization,35 to 192 GHz,Rain,retrieval algorithm,spaceborne radar,tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission TRMM,Ice,Spaceborne radar,Microwave measurements,millimetre wave imaging,maritime precipitation distribution,remote sensing by radar,Reflectivity,atmospheric techniques,"
"analysis of a sub-ghz-band diffraction propagation model for maritime application","2021","In this paper, a low-power wide-area wireless system is used to obtain an appropriate model for sub-GHz-band radio propagation diffraction loss in a multi-island area to compare with actual measurements. For the radio propagation in the multi-island sea discussed in this paper, the contour of the obstacle is clear because the obstacle island is surrounded by a horizontal sea surface. As a result, the Bullington method, which assumes a virtual peak at the intersection of the two ends of the obstacle, is found to be suitable. The results also show that the multi-island sea area has an advantage in improving the accuracy of modeling because the criteria for determining isolated obstacles are easy to determine.","Maritime Propagation,maritime application,Shape measurement,Propagation by Diffraction,Solid modeling,Wireless communication,horizontal sea surface,Bullington method,diffraction propagation model,Diffraction,electromagnetic wave diffraction,radiowave propagation,multiisland sea area,Shape,Sea surface,wide-area wireless system,Low-power Wide-area System,Multiple Knife-Edge Diffraction Model,subGHz-band radio propagation diffraction loss model,marine communication,obstacle island,low-power wide-area wireless system,Analytical models,"
"visual attention analysis for critical operations in maritime collision avoidance","2022","The research on how to provide effective onboard decision support for surface ships, especially in critical operational scenes such as collision avoidance, has been triggered as a goal in recent years. From the authorsâ€™ perspective, to achieve this goal, it is crucial to comprehensively understand the operational logic and mechanism of the human navigators. In this paper, we use wearable eye tracker glasses to collect visual attention data from the navigators. The scene is established as a collision avoidance task in a strait water channel on a maritime simulator. By using the concept of critical operations, the whole sailing is divided into cruising and maneuvering time windows. The visual attention is analyzed in terms of the transition time/frequency and area of interest. It is the first time to exclusively analyze the navigatorsâ€™ visual attention in collision-avoidance tasks.

"remote sensing of bush fire dynamics in central africa from 1984 to 1988: analysis in relation to regional vegetation and pluviometric patterns","1995","Spatial and temporal subcontinental patterns of fire distribution in Africa, may vary strongly from year to year. These variations may be of climatic or anthropic origin. Global Area Coverage (GAC) data, from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), are known both to provide a good description of fire calendar and on a continental scale, a good indicator of locations of intense fire activity. In fact, the GAC data, available on a daily basis back to July 1981, is the only source of information actually available to determine burning patterns both on a continental scale and over long periods of time. This study presents the spatio-temporal distribution of vegetation fire in Central Africa, as derived from GAC imagery, over the four 1984/85 to 1987/88 dry seasons of the Northern Hemisphere (November to February periods). The analysis of the mean fire distribution patterns over the four dry seasons, as defined by vegetation cover and pluviometric conditions, shows a north to south gradient of fire activity in the savannah domain: This gradient of fire activity has been previously related to the annual pluviometric calendar and the amount of rainfall. The strong interannual variability in fire activity observed for this four-years-period could not, however, be explained by the monthly pluviometric patterns. The observed fire gradient therefore seems to result from additional meteorological or anthropic parameters. The methodology used in this study demonstrates the potential of GAC data for fire monitoring at a subcontinental scale. Current work is extending the area of interest to the entire African continent using the 10-yr-period of GAC imagery.",""

"data management architecture for service-oriented maritime testbeds","2022","In recent years, numerous new approaches that rely on data-intensive methods have been developed for maritime assistance systems, leading to a compelling need for more elaborate verification and validation procedures. Modern testbeds that can meet these demands are often developed separately from the system itself and provided as generically usable services. However, the joint usage of such testbeds by multiple stakeholders from research and industry confronts them with various challenges in terms of data management: Data control and protection is required to preserve possible competitive advantages or comply with legal framework conditions. The resulting decentralization in data management complicates collaboration, especially in the joint processing and analysis of testbed data. In this paper, we present a decentralized software system, which can deal with these challenges by modelling interrelationships between the stakeholders in a data space, considering their various interests. With the help of a modular data management architecture, the organization of a testbed data basis, as well as the support of verification and validation processes and the evaluation of data streams is made possible. This is achieved with a workflow model for mapping complex and distributed data processing steps. We demonstrate the applicability of the system in an application scenario for the development of a maritime assistance system.","validation procedures,maritime data,data processing steps,Testbed,data space,Ecosystems,Monitoring,legal framework conditions,Stakeholders,validation processes,service-oriented maritime testbeds,data-intensive methods,maritime assistance system,elaborate verification,marine engineering,data ecosystem,Data models,data streams,modern testbeds,verification and validation,Computer architecture,data management,resulting decentralization,competitive advantages,testbed data basis,Certification,joint usage,decentralized software system,modular data management architecture,generically usable services,Task analysis,service-oriented architecture,data management complicates collaboration,joint processing,data handling,"
"aligning value creation and sme competitiveness in the export of maritime services: empirical evidence from trinidad and tobago","2023","The multifaceted composition and preponderance of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) participating in the services sector create unique challenges for specialization, productivity, and innovation, particularly in the export of maritime services. Three issues distilled from the literature are (i) servitization of SMEs, (ii) diversification during periods of uncertainty, and (iii) value creation cluster initiatives as a stimulus for enhancing SME competitiveness, in a circular economy. Aligning value creation and SME competitiveness could drive maritime services export. This paper examines whether SME service-providers could improve competitiveness through value creation and cluster initiatives in the export of maritime services in Trinidad and Tobago (T&T). A survey was conducted in the Leisure Marine Services Cluster. Acquired data on five value creation determinants (namely, repair accuracy, concurrent engineering, quality standard, quality assurance, and quality control) were analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS). Empirical evidence shows that repair accuracy and quality standard had positive estimates, with reliability coefficients above 0.70. The application of cluster initiatives would support the development of a value creation program and enhance SMEâ€™s competitiveness in T&T.","Maintenance engineering,Quality control,Boats,Uncertainty,Sociology,Surveys,Technological innovation,"

"mid-cretaceous sequence stratigraphy and sedimentary cyclicity in the western paris basin","1992","Cenomanian and Turonian depositional patterns of the western Paris Basin are interpreted in terms of sequence stratigraphy. A system tract analysis of the epicontinental “Normandie Basin”, with pelagic chalks, and of the “Maine Platform” covered by clastics, provides evidence for relative changes in coastal onlap; various minor uncomformities are related to these changes of sea level. The four global cycles (UZA or ZC-2.2/2.5) of Haq et al. (1987, 1988) are recognised while an additional one is proposed for the Geslinianum Zone. In addition, periodic rhythmic cycles are commonly registered within the chalk, expressed by the repitition of various facies enhanced both by biosedimentary processes and diagenetic alteration. These elementary climatic cycles allow accurate lithostratigraphic correlations. During this period when the sea level peaked on the tectonically passive border of the Armorican block, the Paris Basin appears to record a detailed set of events which can be correlated with those in the Atlantic, Boreal and Tethyan provinces.

"long-distance mobility in the north-western mediterranean during the neolithic transition using high resolution pottery sourcing","2019","The Neolithisation of the North-Western Mediterranean is still an open issue. New data has recently enriched the chronological and cultural archaeological framework, providing more precise absolute dates and revealing a new and more complex process of expansion of farming in Southern Europe. The Mediterranean route of colonization (6000–5600 BCE), is characterized by the so-called Impressed Wares (IW) or Impresso-Cardial Complex (ICC) which demonstrate huge internal diversity in material culture, notably in pottery style and technology. This polythetic imprint of the ICC is intimately linked to dynamics of raw material exploitation (such as obsidian) and interconnections within circulation and exchange networks of goods. Through a comparative and multi-analytical approach to pottery characterization of entire assemblages from two distant sites in the North-Western Mediterranean, each characterized by predominantly local pottery production, we demonstrate long-distance mobility of non-local pottery vessels from the Tyrrhenian regions towards the Languedoc (up to 1000 km) during the Neolithic transition.

"policy implications for third-tier countries considering actd programs: south korea as a case study","2015","As a certain society's military strength depends on its technological capabilities, decision makers that do not retain the capacity to produce a full spectrum of defense systems to meet the country's requirement (herein Third Tier Countries, or TTCs), need to administer different acquisition policies than countries that furnish a complete range of arms. South Korea, with its limited defense industrial base, has implemented Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration (ACTD) programs since 2007. Provided that other TTCs are considering the ACTD process, analogous cases should be instructive. Thus, this paper is a comparative analysis of Korean ACTDs vis-a-vis those of the United States to draw distinctive ACTD policy implications for TTCs. For a review of 32 programs, four perspectives are suggested: imminent threats, technological capabilities, budgetary constraints, and transition plans. Examined from these dimensions, prioritization and reification of imminent threats should be a beginning point. If there are some identified threats that can be countered by ACTDs, then boundaries in technological capabilities and budgetary constraints ought to be taken into account. Finally, an effective technology transition plan for ACTDs in accordance with other non-military-led defense R&D projects would help in determining the success of the open acquisition process.","Science and technology policy,JCTD,ACTD,Open Acquisition Institute,Defense R&D strategy,"
"a deep semantic autoencoder for maritime wireless communications","2023","With the rapid development of maritime transportation, ocean tourism, monitoring, surveillance and aquaculture, the maritime communication industry has encountered new opportunities. Maritime End-to-end (E2E) communication systems based on deep learning (DL) have become diverse, while semantic communication systems have become a critical research point due to their ability to understand and analyze natural language. In this paper, we propose a deep semantic autoencoder (DSA) for maritime wireless communications. The DSA consists of a semantic encoder, channel encoder, channel decoder, and semantic decoder. The DSA employs transformers and convolutional neural networks to extract and restore the meaning of sentences while minimizing semantic errors during transmission. In order to enhance the effectiveness of the DSA in transmitting maritime data, the Rician fading channel is utilized to simulate complex and varied marine environments. Furthermore, the system parameters of the DSA are optimized through training the maritime data and calculating the loss functions. Extensive simulation experiments indicate that compared to the benchmark, the DSA demonstrates superior bilingual evaluation understudy and sentence similarity performance under different signal-to-noise ratio conditions, indicating its ability to effectively extract semantics.","end-to-end,semantic communication systems,Semantics,surveillance,maritime data,Transportation,Benchmark testing,deep learning (artificial intelligence),system parameters,maritime wireless communications,semantic encoder,maritime communication industry,deep semantic autoencoder,natural language processing,semantic errors,Wireless communication,critical research point,deep learning,marine safety,semantics,marine engineering,Maritime wireless communications,Rician channels,maritime transportation,maritime end-to-end communication systems,convolutional neural nets,semantic decoder,Training,ocean tourism,marine communication,Simulation,Surveillance,artificial intelligence,DSA,channel decoder,aquaculture,Rician fading channel,"
"stable isotope geochemistry of corals from costa rica as proxy indicator of the el niño/southern oscillation (enso)","1994","We analyzed the δ18O and δ13C time-series contained in coral skeletons collected from Isla del Caño, Costa Rica, that survived the 1982–1983 El Niño warming event. Coral δ18O give a record of thermal histories with a precision of ~0.5°C. For this locality, we have determined that the average Δδw effect in the coral skeletons is equivalent to 33% of the skeletal δ18O range. Therefore, if δw effects are not compensated for, the annual skeletal-δ18O range displays a temperature range of 1 °C lower than actual values. The isotopic record of Porites lobata skeletons shows simultaneous depletions in 18O and 13C at skeletal levels corresponding to 1983, coincident with the El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event. Therefore, the El Niño event is not only recorded as negative δ18O anomalies in the skeleton, suggesting the warming of ambient waters, but also in the δ13C signal as negative anomalies, indicating coral bleaching. Contrary to the predictions of the “13C-insolation model” that the annual carbon isotope variation should be attenuated with depth in proportion to the decrease in light-intensity variation with depth, we found a clear trend where Δδ13C increases with depth. Coral bioenergetics, which depends on both coral physiology and ecology, may adequately explain the unexpected increase in δ13C range with depth, without contradicting the seasonal character of δ13C variability with the solar irradiance cycle. Although some authors have determined the presence of hiatuses in the skeletal record due to severe stress and growth cessation, in this study it has been found that skeletal growth was not seriously diminished during the El Niño year of 1983. We attribute the good agreement of the δ18O record with the timing and magnitude of the El Niño 1982–1983 warming event to the nature of the warming trend in the area, as well as to some synergistic implications of coral tolerance to thermal stress.",""

"context-enhanced vessel prediction based on ornstein-uhlenbeck processes using historical ais traffic patterns: real-world experimental results","2014","Traffic route analysis and prediction are both essential for maritime security. Specifically, the prediction of a vessel position is useful to provide alerts about upcoming events (e.g., opportunities and threats). However, accurate prediction along a route in the maritime domain is a challenging task, due to the complex and dynamic nature of traffic patterns. This paper presents a vessel prediction method, based on the popular Ornstein-Uhlenbeck stochastic processes, whose parameters are estimated from historical patterns of life. The historical traffic routes are obtained by pre-processing Automatic Identification System (AIS) data via the CMRE tool called Traffic Route Extraction for Anomaly Detection (TREAD). These recurrent routes allow prediction of the position of a vessel that is following one of these routes, surprisingly, by several hours. The method is validated using a case study related to the second data campaign of the EC FP7 Project New Service Capabilities for Integrated and Advanced Maritime Surveillance (NEREIDS)1. We demonstrate that the prediction accuracy is well represented by the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model.","surveillance,New Service Capabilities for Integrated and Advanced Maritime Surveillance,anomaly detection,security of data,Stochastic processes,Predictive models,Transmitters,historical AIS traffic pattern,vessel position prediction uncertainty,context enhanced vessel prediction method,NEREIDS,automatic identification system,CMRE tool,stochastic processes,marine engineering,Target tracking,maritime domain,Radar tracking,Real-time systems,Ornstein-Uhlenbeck stochastic process,traffic route extraction,traffic engineering computing,parameter estimation,Data mining,traffic route analysis,EC FP7 Project,"
"green energy and content-aware data transmissions in maritime wireless communication networks","2015","In this paper, we investigate the network throughput and energy sustainability of green-energy-powered maritime wireless communication networks. Specifically, we study how to optimize the schedule of data traffic tasks to maximize the network throughput with Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access technology. To this end, we formulate it as an optimization problem to maximize the weight of the total delivered data packets, while ensuring that harvested energy can successfully support transmission tasks. The formulated energy and content-aware vessel throughput maximize problem is proved to be NP-complete. We propose a green energy and content-aware data transmission framework that incorporates the energy limitation of both infostations and delay-tolerant network throw boxes. The green energy buffer is modeled as a G/G/1 queue, and two heuristic algorithms are designed to optimize the transmission throughput and energy sustainability. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our proposed algorithms can provide simple yet efficient solutions in a maritime wireless communication network with sustainable energy.","telecommunication power management,Green products,Throughput,delay tolerant network,maritime wireless communication network throughput maximisation,heuristic algorithm,Streaming media,Wireless networks,telecommunication scheduling,content-aware data transmission,optimization problem,sustainable energy,data communication,maritime wideband communication,NP-complete,optimisation,worldwide interoperability for microwave access technology,energy sustainability,leaky bucket,radio networks,telecommunication traffic,green energy data transmission,delay tolerant networks,marine communication,Algorithm design and analysis,WiMAX,WiMax,energy harvesting,queueing theory,data traffic scheduling,Diffusion approximation,G/G/1 queue algorithms,"

"six years of electrified convection over the island of corsica monitored by saetta: general trends and anomalously electrified thunderstorms during african dust south flow events","2022","By means of the SAETTA 3D lightning mapping array, the total lightning activity has been detected in a 240 km × 240 km square domain centred on the island of Corsica located in the West Mediterranean basin, and characterized by a maritime and mountainous environment, with a complex and relatively high relief. The study period covers the months from April to December of the 6 years from 2014 to 2019. Observations are reported with a horizontal resolution of 1 km and a vertical resolution of 0.1 km in terms of density of VHF sources emitted by lightning, and of number of lightning day, in plane- and vertical- projections. Vertical distributions of VHF sources are also provided monthly for the whole period and over the full domain. These 3D long term observations show that the number of lightning days is more important on the main relief of the island. The density of VHF sources exhibits a sharp maximum over the confluence area of the 3 main valleys in the center of the northern part of the island, characterized by a recurrent and vertically well developed lightning activity. The period from 11:00 UTC to 14:00 UTC in July, and in a lesser extent in June and August, is at the origin of this density maximum. This behavior is thus due to a diurnal convection. The whole lightning activity is characterized by 2 maxima in June and September. The first one is linked with the diurnal convection in phase with the maximum elevation of the Sun. The second one must be due to usual large-scale organized thunderstorm events of the fall season. The vertical distribution of VHF sources exhibits an increase in the number of VHF sources from April to August at all altitudes, as well as an increase in the altitude of the main upper peak (from 5.8 km to 10 km) and of the secondary lower peak (from 4.2 km to 6.7 km) of this distribution. From August to December, the opposite evolution appears, except that October is characterized by a strong anomaly with a single intense lower peak at 5.5 km, apparently due to 2 strong events corresponding to anomalously electrified thunderstorms. Several of these anomalously electrified thunderstorms (negative dipoles) are reported. They are all characterized by the movement of cloud cells spatially small and relatively undeveloped vertically propagating from southwest to northeast and associated with a strong transport of desert dust from the African continent. The analysis of the meteorological environment of some of the studied events allows concluding that in each of the studied cases elevated convection was triggered, above the relatively dry atmospheric boundary layer characterized by a strong convective inhibition. The low cloud liquid water content which is a key parameter of the non-inductive charging process is probably a good candidate to explain the anomalous electrification of these events.","Lightning,Anomalous charge structure,Corsica,Aerosol,Long term observations,Convection,African dust,"

"experimental aeromagnetic survey using a rotary-wing aircraft system: a case study in heizhugou, sichuan, china","2021","The mid-high mountain area in Western China is an important area for an aeromagnetic survey in China. To solve the problem that a ground survey cannot be carried out in the research area of Heizhugou (Sichuan, China), an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) aeromagnetic survey system based on a three-axis fluxgate sensor was developed. It can solve the large-scale magnetic survey problem in special areas (mountains, canyons, lakes, etc.). The noise level test, conformance test, and sensor correction methods used in the development of the UAV aeromagnetic system are discussed. When performing sensor calibration, the error generation mechanism was analyzed according to the basic principle of the sensor. Then, the component output model was established, and the zero offset factor was calibrated, as well as the scale factor. After the nine-element iteration method calibration, the steering error was reduced from hundreds to less than 20 nT, better than the least squares method. The aeromagnetic results were compared with ground magnetic measurements, and the results were good.","Fluxgate sensor,Tethys,Aeromagnetic survey,System test,Rotary-wing UAV,"
"integrated machine learning and probabilistic degradation approach for vessel electric motor prognostics","2023","In the transition towards more sustainable ships, electric motors (EM) are being used in ship propulsion systems to reduce emissions and increase efficiency. The safe operation of ships is crucial, and prognostics and health management applications have emerged as effective solutions to transit towards monitored reliable systems. In this context, this paper presents a probabilistic EM prognostics model integrating data-driven operational models and physics-informed degradation models. Firstly, motor torque and winding temperature are estimated through connected machine learning models, which are based on operational and meteorological data. Operational and meteorological variables drive the EM degradation model and enable the analysis of EM degradation under different operational and environmental conditions. Subsequently, EM remaining useful life (RUL) is predicted within a probabilistic Monte-Carlo approach combining the thermal-stress model along with the associated uncertainties. The methodology is tested on a real case study of the OV Ryvingen vessel, with collected data during voyages along the Norwegian coast. Results confirm the validity of the designed RUL model showing that, under normal operation conditions, the degradation is mild, and the temperature measurement errors are important for RUL estimation.","Degradation,Uncertainty,Insulation,Prognostics,Machine learning,Electric motor,"

To establish an effective VLC network in the actual marine environment, an effective channel transmission model needs to be established and used to study the performance of the maritime VLC link. Based on the Pierson-Moskowitz spectrum, the geometric model of links between lighthouse and ship is established. Considering the aperture averaging effect, Lognormal distribution is employed to deduce the mathematical expression of average bit error rate (BER). The effects of sea wave height, transmission distance, atmospheric turbulence intensity, receiver aperture size and wavelength on the average BER is analyzed.

"geochemical atlas of croatia: environmental implications and geodynamical thread","2012","Geochemical atlas of Croatia resulted from the regional geochemical survey based on the low-density (1 sample per 25km2) soil sampling having covered the entire territory of the state. Basically, the collection of maps showing distribution of a set of elements with particular emphasis of possibly harmful elements (PHE) was focused on elucidation of environmental implications brought about by human impact (ingress of Pb, Zn, Cd and other elements derived from anthropogenic sources) against some zero-level represented by geochemical background. However, the effect of blending of anthropogenic and natural (geogene) signal in the upper soil was already recognized during the mapping campaign having steered further research to assessment of geological imprint in the soil geochemical signature. Therefore this work was also aimed at finding appropriate avenues to understanding how both signals behave at various scales (regional or local). Using suitable statistical techniques (posterior probabilities from discriminant function analysis (DFA)) it was found that anthropogenic signal may be completely obliterated by the geogenic geochemical signature at a larger, regional, scale, which is otherwise locally strong and adversely affects the environment (e.g. PHE with regard to the Drava River).","Geochemical atlas,Soils,Regional geochemical mapping,Posterior probabilities,Croatia,"
"an application of sensor-based anomaly detection in the maritime industry","2016","In this paper we present an application of sensor-based anomaly detection in maritime transport. The study is based on real sensor data streamed from a ship to shore, where the data is analysed through a big data analytics platform. The novelty of this work originates in the use of data from sensors covering different aspects of the ship operation, exemplified here by propulsion power, speed over ground and ship motion in four different degrees of freedom. The developed method employs Auto Associative Kernel Regression (AAKR) for signal reconstruction, and the Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT) technique for anomaly detection, where different hypothesis tests looking both at mean and variance deviations have been tested. In order to compare different settings, formal state of the art performance metrics have been used. We demonstrate that the AAKR model produces good reconstructions when the observations are similar to observations represented in the training data, and for some examples of simulated anomalies, the method reveals the abnormal behaviour. As long as the parameters are tuned carefully, alarms are triggered appropriately by the SPRT.","AAKR model,sequential probability ratio test,Kernel,Industries,Marine vehicles,ship motion,regression analysis,Signal reconstruction,marine propulsion,data analysis,ships,auto associative kernel regression,propulsion power,marine engineering,maritime transport,Training data,signal reconstruction,Measurement,Big Data,Robustness,ship speed,degrees of freedom,maritime industry,Big Data analytics platform,real sensor data streaming,ship operation,SPRT technique,sensor-based anomaly detection application,"
"the application of remote sensing to canadian petroleum exploration: promising and yet unexploited","1986","This paper reviews some of the successful applications of digital remote sensing to petroleum exploration in different parts of the world. They include the updating of existing geologic maps, the location of anomalies related to hydrocarbon seepage, and the integration of the digital imagery into geologic databases to assess hydrocarbon potential on a given scale. Although most of these techniques are useful potentially in the Canadian environment, there seems to be some reticence in this country towards the use of remotely sensed data. Based on discussions with a number of industry and research personnel, an analysis is made of the reasons why Canadian geoscientists have not yet taken advantage of this readily available tool. Some explanations include: (1) the poor resolution of sensors such as the LANDSAT MSS, (2) the till and vegetation overlying parts of the country, and (3) the fact that some areas of the country are so well mapped that it is felt that a system such as LANDSAT could add no relevant information. Conversely, several considerations would seem to favor widespread usage of remotely sensed data in Canada now that the spectral and spatial resolutions of operational sensors are constantly improving. It is possible to map geologic features such as faults from remotely sensed imagery even if they are buried beneath deep till. The vegetation which covers so much of the land surface can provide both structural and geochemical information. There remain large expanses of the country that are relatively unexplored. Finally, considerable expertise exists in Canada in geoscience data integration and image processing, much of it related to mineral-resource work; this expertise may be directed towards petroleum-resource evaluation. Some procedures are recommended for Canadian petroleum geologists in order that they may derive maximum benefits from remotely sensed data.","Petroleum exploration,Image analysis,SPOT-1,Remote sensing,LANDSAT,Canadian petroleum industry,Data integration,"
"collision risk inference system for maritime autonomous surface ships using colregs rules compliant collision avoidance","2021","Maritime autonomous surface ships (MASS) need to be sufficiently safe to gain commercial acceptance. Collision avoidance strategies in such MASS should comply with the International Regulations for Preventing Collision at the Sea (COLREGs). According to the COLREGs, collision risk assessment, which determines the optimal positioning and timing via all available means appropriate to the prevailing circumstances and conditions, is crucial for preventing collisions. However, existing collision risk assessment methods do not consider all vital factors for the COLREGs rules compliant collision avoidance. We propose a collision risk inference system for MASS that complies with COLREGs vital rules for collision avoidance as follows: 1) actions to avoid collision are defined according to the degree of danger, and a suitable response distance is determined; 2) a collision risk index according to the enlarged ship domain based on the designated response distance by each level is set; 3) all vital factors of the COLREGs rules compliant collision avoidance are extracted as the data when the ship domain enlarged by each level is overlapped; 4) the collision risk inference system is developed by learning extracted data via the adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system. In contrast to existing research, the proposed system considers all vital variables in the COLREGs rules compliant collision avoidance guidelines, thereby improving the timings and positionings of the potential collision warning. Consequently, it could secure more time for decision making to take necessary collision prevention action.","marine accidents,existing collision risk assessment methods,Risk management,Preventing Collision,maritime autonomous surface ships,Marine vehicles,fuzzy reasoning,aerospace safety,collision risk index,necessary collision prevention action,Collision avoidance strategies,ships,marine safety,Accidents,Collision avoidance,Shape,risk management,Sea surface,decision making,ship domain,COLREGs vital rules,Adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system,risk analysis,potential collision warning,near-collision accident,COLREGs rules compliant collision avoidance guidelines,COLREGs,collision risk inference system,Navigation,collision avoidance,"
"horizon detection from electro-optical sensors under maritime environment","2020","In recent years, target detection in maritime surveillance has become a popular subject. Horizon under maritime environment is one of the most important semantic boundaries for segmenting the image into sea and sky. With the help of horizon, seeking scope can be restricted to a definite small area, which significantly reduces the computational complexity. Meanwhile, horizon is used to automatically adjust the attitude of air vehicles as well. Although a plenty of algorithms for horizon detection have been created, they are prone to low visibility and occlusions. In this paper, a novel robust algorithm based on probability distribution and physical characteristics is proposed. At first, the probabilities are distributed to each vertically divided region by weighted textures, and the sea-sky region is located from definite probabilistic intervals. Based on a Canny edge detector, Hough transform extracts a series of candidate horizons. Finally, a novel voting method is applied. The line with the maximum value will be regarded as the true horizon. The proposed algorithm can not only precisely detect the horizon from fine images but also from blurred image, even with splashed camera. The performance of the proposed algorithm is verified by experiments on 65 videos containing more than 20 000 frames under different sceneries. The results illustrate that our algorithm can detect the horizon line with minor errors in comparison with other five state-of-the-art algorithms.","Image edge detection,electro-optical sensors,target detection,Feature extraction,Contextual information,Image color analysis,edge detection,sea-sky region,seaâ€“sky region extraction,Hough transforms,maritime surveillance,object detection,Probability distribution,image texture,horizon detection,electro-optical devices,physical characteristics,semantic boundaries,electro-optical sensor,maritime environment,marine communication,image sensors,Sensors,Computational modeling,image segmentation,Transforms,"
"dbscan algorithm for ais data reconstruction","2021","Automatic Identification System (AIS) is a telecommunication system created to allow ships to communicate with each other by exchanging messages containing information such as vessel’s ID, position, speed, heading, etc. AIS is useful in many cases, such as early ship collision detection. However, its terrestrial segment’s drawback is a relatively low range (about 74 km, roughly 40 nautical miles). Satellite Automatic Identification System (SAT-AIS) was introduced to overcome this limitation, but it suffers from its own problem known as packet collision. The satellite receives messages from multiple terrestrial cells and communication is synchronized within such cells, but not between them, thus messages got lost or damaged when they appear at the satellite at the same time. In this paper, we present a machine learning-based approach to reconstruct those missing messages and deeply investigate whether or not a density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) can be considered in the first stage of the reconstruction. The experiment focuses on findig the optimal parameters for the clustering, running it both on original and damaged data to finally ascertain that DSBCAN can distinguish individual trajectories in a dataset that can be further reconstructed.","clustering,DBSCAN,AIS data analysis,trajectory reconstruction,AIS,"
"hfpnet: super feature aggregation pyramid network for maritime remote sensing small-object detection","2023","In recent years, with the development of the maritime industry, computer vision tasks based on optical remote sensing images have gained increasing attention in the field of marine remote sensing. However, in complex marine meteorological environments, traditional detection methods often suffer from high rates of missed detections and false alarms for small targets. To address this issue, this article proposes a super feature pyramid network (HFPNet) for detecting marine remote sensing objects, which includes a feature enhancement module (FEM) and a multiscale feature aggregation module (MFM). The FEM can highlight features of small targets and weaken complex background features in detection, the MFM can share high-level and low-level features to better fuse multiscale feature information. Additionally, due to the lack of marine remote sensing object datasets, this article constructs a marine target detection dataset (MTDS) containing six types of marine objects. To address the issue of imbalanced positive and negative samples in the dataset, this article designs a network loss function to accelerate network convergence and improve the accuracy of small-target detection. Compared with other models, HFPNet achieved the highest $\text{mAP}_{0.5}$ of 97.48% and 95.46% on the self-built dataset MTDS and the public dataset NWPU-VHR-10, respectively, after environmental enhancement. At the same time, it also achieved the fastest frames per second (FPS) on the test set.

"oxygen isotope composition of diatoms as late holocene climate proxy at two-yurts lake, central kamchatka, russia","2015","Especially in combination with other proxies, the oxygen isotope composition of diatom silica (δ18Odiatom) from lake sediments is useful for interpreting past climate conditions. This paper presents the first oxygen isotope data of fossil diatoms from Kamchatka, Russia, derived from sediment cores from Two-Yurts Lake (TYL). For reconstructing Late Holocene climate change, palaeolimnological investigations also included diatom, pollen and chironomid analysis. The most recent diatom sample (δ18Odiatom=+23.3‰) corresponds well with the present day isotopic composition of the TYL water (mean δ18O=−14.8‰) displaying a reasonable isotope fractionation in the system silica-water. Nonetheless, the TYL δ18Odiatom record is mainly controlled by changes in the isotopic composition of the lake water. TYL is considered as a dynamic system triggered by differential environmental changes closely linked with lake-internal hydrological factors. The diatom silica isotope record displays large variations in δ18Odiatom from +27.3‰ to +23.3‰ from about ~4.5kyr BP until today. A continuous depletion in δ18Odiatom of 4.0‰ is observed in the past 4.5kyr, which is in good accordance with other hemispheric environmental changes (i.e. a summer insolation-driven Mid- to Late Holocene cooling). The overall cooling trend is superimposed by regional hydrological and atmospheric–oceanic changes. These are related to the interplay between Siberian High and Aleutian Low as well as to the ice dynamics in the Sea of Okhotsk. Additionally, combined δ18Odiatom and chironomid interpretations provide new information on changes related to meltwater input to lakes. Hence, this diatom isotope study provides further insight into hydrology and climate dynamics of this remote, rarely investigated area.","Palaeoclimate,Aleutian Low,Palaeolimnology,Diatom oxygen isotopes,Holocene,Biogenic silica,"

"fire-climate-human interactions during the postglacial period at sunrise ridge, mount rainier national park, washington (usa)","2017","With the creation of Mount Rainier National Park (MORA) in 1899 came the active management of the park's landscapes and a heavy emphasis on fire suppression. Today, managers at MORA seek to better manage current fire activity; however, this requires an improved understanding of past fire activity on the mountain. In this study high-resolution macroscopic charcoal analysis and pollen analysis of lake sediment records was used to reconstruct the postglacial fire and vegetation history for the Sunrise Ridge area of MORA. Fire activity was lowest during the Late Glacial when vegetation was sparse and climate was cool and dry. Fire activity increased during the early Holocene as the regional climate warmed and dried, and burnable biomass became more abundant. Fire activity continued to increase into the middle Holocene (until ca. 6600 cal yr BP) even as the regional climate became wetter and eventually cooler; the modern-day mesic forest and subalpine meadow landscapes of the park established at this time. Fire activity was generally highest and mean fire return intervals were lowest on Sunrise Ridge during the late Holocene, and are consistent with tree-ring based estimates of fire frequency. The similarity between the Sunrise Ridge and other paleofire records in the Pacific Northwest suggests that broad-scale climatic shifts, such as the retreat of the Cordilleran ice sheet and changes in annual insolation, as well as increased interannual climate variability (i.e., drought) particularly in the middle to late Holocene, were responsible for changes in fire activity during the postglacial period. However, abundant and increasing archaeological evidence from Sunrise Ridge during the middle to late Holocene suggests that humans may have also influenced the landscape at this time. It is likely that fires will continue to increase at MORA as drought becomes a more frequent occurrence in the Pacific Northwest.","Fire history,Long-term climate variability,Pollen,Pacific Northwest archaeology,Anthropogenic use of fire,Charcoal,"

"parallel operation of permanent magnet generators and diode rectifiers in maritime dc power system considering fuel economy","2022","The dc grid system is attracting attention as a new electric power distribution method for several vessel kinds due to its high fuel efficiency compared with the ac grid. The combination of a wound rotor generator (WRG) and a diode rectifier [diode front end (DFE)] has been typically applied as a generation part of the dc grid. Still, the combination of a permanent magnet generator (PMG) and a DFE has been recently studied to take advantage of their simplicity, cost-effectiveness, robustness, high reliability, and high efficiency. However, although a single-operation mode of the â€œPMG + DFEâ€ system was analyzed in the literature, research for the parallel operation of the â€œPMG + DFEâ€ system has not yet been conducted. The â€œPMG + DFEâ€ system should be operated along the optimal operating line (OOL) in the powerâ€“voltage ( $P$ â€“ $V$ ) domain to minimize fuel consumption. This OOL in the  $P$ â€“ $V$  domain includes negative, zero, and positive slopes under light, medium, and heavy loads, respectively. Therefore, if the conventional droop control is applied to this system, it cannot be operated along the OOL. This article introduces modified droop control for operating paralleled â€œPMG + DFEâ€ system along the OOL in the  $P$ â€“ $V$  domain.

Instead of relying on the manually collected statistical information from different port authorities and shipping companies, we propose to leverage the pervasive ship GPS traces and maritime open data to derive port performance indicators, including ship traffic, container throughput, berth utilization, and terminal productivity. These performance indicators are found to be directly related to the number of container ships arriving at the terminals and the number of containers handled at each ship. Therefore, we propose a framework that takes the ships' container-handling events at terminals as the basis for port performance measurement. With the inferred port performance indicators, we further compare the strengths and weaknesses of different container ports at the terminal level, port level, and region level, which can potentially benefit terminal productivity improvement, liner schedule optimization, and regional economic development planning. In order to evaluate the proposed framework, we conduct extensive studies on large-scale real-world GPS traces of container ships collected from major container ports worldwide through the year, as well as various maritime open data sources concerning ships and ports. Evaluation results confirm that the proposed framework not only can accurately estimate various port performance indicators but also effectively produces port comparison results such as port performance ranking and port region comparison.","open data,Productivity,container throughput,Ports (Computers),Throughput,regional economic development planning,performance indicators,liner schedule optimization,GPS traces,Marine vehicles,urban computing,Global Positioning System,port authorities,scheduling,port operation,terminal productivity improvement,statistical analysis,ships,Containers,shipping companies,container port performance measurement,marine engineering,berth utilization,container logistics,optimisation,Measurement,sea ports,comparison leveraging ship,maritime open data sources,logistics data processing,ship traffic,Container port,intelligent transportation system (ITS),statistical information,GPS trace,productivity,"
"joint tracking and classification for extended targets in maritime surveillance","2018","In the framework of target tracking, joint tracking and classification (JTC) based approaches have been recently introduced to adjust the trajectory estimation to a given type of target. In a maritime surveillance framework, these approaches leverage marine radar capabilities to provide high resolution measurements. It can then be helpful to choose relevant motion models regarding the tracking algorithm. Among them, the authors recently proposed to take advantage of the target extent measurements for single or multiple-target tracking. This work was based on a point source hypothesis regarding the position measurement of each target. However, this is no longer suitable for extended target tracking. An extension of our previous work to track properly extended targets whose position measurement can be obtained from any point source of its surface is thus proposed. For this purpose, random matrix theory is leveraged. Eventually, the relevance of the proposed approach with simulated data is analyzed.","high resolution measurements,position measurement,Position measurement,marine radar,Bayesian estimation,image resolution,image motion analysis,matrix algebra,trajectory estimation,maritime surveillance framework,Radar measurements,random matrix theory,multiple-target tracking,target tracking,tracking algorithm,joint tracking and classification,Target tracking,extended target tracking,image classification,search radar,Radar tracking,radar imaging,random matrix,radar tracking,target extent measurements,Surveillance,motion models,Joint tracking and classification,target classification,marine radar capabilities,target extent,"

"gatc and deepcut: deep spatiotemporal feature extraction and clustering for large-scale transportation network partition","2022","The network partition is an important method for many key transport problems, e.g., transport network zoning, parallel computing of traffic assignment problem, and analysis of the macroscopic fundamental diagram, to name a few. This paper designs two partition frameworks called GATC (Graph attention auto-encoder for clustering) and DeepCut, which can partition the transportation network into several components. These two frameworks combine unsupervised deep learning and clustering, taking into account both temporal factors and spatial factors. Firstly, the traffic flow time series data is encoded by graph attention auto-encoder, with graph structure and content considered. Secondly, the normalized cut method is used to partition the transportation network into several homogeneous sub-networks. DeepCut encodes the input data by a simple encoder, and the normalized cut method is used to partition the transportation network. The proposed methods are verified by a numerical example, which demonstrates the rationality and effectiveness of GATC and DeepCut for transportation network partition.","Auto-encoder,Transportation network partition,Graph attention,Clustering,"

This work analyses the wave parameter variations of the dielectric response of timber according to the direction of an electrical field applied by ground penetrating radar (GPR) with a 1.6 GHz antenna. Two types of tests were performed on samples of maritime pine timber (Pinus pinaster Ait.). After the acquisition process the propagation velocities, amplitudes, and spectra variations were compared for the studied fiber directions. Interesting differences were found between these parameters when the field was propagated in a parallel direction or perpendicularly to the fiber.","Optical fiber testing,Directive antennas,Anisotropic magnetoresistance,Ground penetrating radar,Optical fiber polarization,spectra variation analysis,Dipole antennas,Radar antennas,Antennas and propagation,Electromagnetic analysis,amplitude variation analysis,velocity variation analysis,dielectric anisotropy,Dielectrics,timber,"

"compensation of antenna misalignment using selection diversity for maritime communications","2018","Communication is essential for coastal and rural areas, and providing an alternative method of communication for isolated coves through maritime communications is a way to cater that need. In order to create a reliable communication system, antenna misalignment attributed to wave motion of the sea must be accounted for because losses in transmission and reception occur. The scope of this study covers the angular variation of wave motion, particularly the roll angle tilting an antenna experiences. In this paper, improvements of using diversity techniques for a 2.4 GHz communication link in the maritime environment were investigated. In particular, spatial diversity, which uses independent multiple antennas to achieve a level of performance one antenna could not, was employed. The use of selection diversity, a type of spatial diversity that selects the antenna branch with the best signal strength, to compensate antenna misalignment is considered and analyzed. A transmitter and receiver front-end incorporating selection diversity were designed and implemented. Results prove that the use of the proposed scheme increase the overall gain of the communication link. There is an average of 1.35 dB and 5.3 dB increase for 2 and 3 antennas respectively, in using receive diversity compared to no diversity, and an average of 2.4 dB increase in using 3 antenna transmit diversity as opposed to no diversity, all of which were exposed to continuous tilting conditions. The presented plots exhibit a general trend showing that selection diversity reduces the received signal strength fluctuations to lower power, and minimizes the losses due to antenna misalignment.","antenna branch,transmitter front-end,receiving antennas,receiver front-end,Transmit Diversity.,antenna arrays,Selection Diversity,Sea measurements,Transmitting antennas,communication link,independent multiple antennas,selection diversity,antenna experiences,Testing,noise figure 2.4 dB,noise figure 5.3 dB,Maritime Communication,spatial diversity,frequency 2.4 GHz,receive diversity,diversity reception,transmitting antennas,roll angle tilting,antenna transmit diversity,wave motion,Receiving antennas,Antenna Misalignment,maritime environment,marine communication,antenna misalignment compensation,UHF antennas,Receive Diversity,maritime communications,"
"boom: bottleneck-aware opportunistic multicast strategy for cooperative maritime sensing","2023","With the advancements in sensing technologies, maritime sensing has become indispensable in various domains, including logistics, weather forecasting, and marine ranching. However, transmitting large volumes of sensing data faces many challenges in the maritime environment. Firstly, the transmissions purely depend on satellite links often costly and suffer from long propagation latency. On the other hand, traditional unicast transmission results in data duplication, wasting valuable marine communication resources. With the increasing density of sensing devices, the communication distance between maritime sensors has become closer, enabling the deployment of maritime opportunistic networks consisting of device-to-device links. Rather than using unicast transmission over satellite links, employing multicast with opportunistic routing enables simultaneous data transmission to multiple destinations and saves communication resources. Even though the multicast method can avoid redundancy, conducting multicast without considering the maritime characteristics (i.e., the dynamics and the distribution of sensors) may lead to inefficient data delivery. Through real-world experiments, we observe that devices located on the edges of the network have a relatively low receiving rate compared with internal ones and tend to be the bottleneck of the overall multicast progress. Based on this observation, we propose BOOM, a bottleneck-aware opportunistic multicast strategy aiming at reducing multicast latency, taking into account the influence of the bottleneck node and broadcasting rate. Prominently, within maritime scenarios challenged by extreme conditions such as storms, typhoons, and tsunamis, BOOMâ€™s emphasis encompasses the adaptability of multicast strategies, which necessitates dynamic adjustments in response to equipment failures and shifts in network topology. Through mathematical analysis, we prove the formation of opportunistic multicast is an NP-hard problem and further design a heuristic algorithm based on the convex-hull method to reduce the computational cost in strategy generation. We compare BOOM with four other algorithms using real-world maritime vessel trajectories in various scenarios. The simulation result illustrates that the BOOM achieves a significant reduction in transmission latency, which reduces 36% when sensors are sparsely located in water areas, and the reduction could reach up to 59% when sensors are more dense. Furthermore, in extreme environmental testing conditions, BOOM continues to outperform other algorithms in terms of completion time, with performance improvements of up to 39% and 49% in sparse and dense topology environments respectively.","Data communication,Sensors,Task analysis,Maritime Sensing,Multicast Strategy,Marine vehicles,Satellite broadcasting,Wireless sensor networks,Opportunistic Multicast,Unicast,"

"semantics of maritime routes: conciliating complementary views","2021","The notion of maritime route is widely used in describing, modelling or analysing maritime navigation. However, the term conveys several meanings and views differ on its very definition. In this paper, we propose an overview of different perspectives of maritime route from navigation, to surveillance, to data science. In this respect, our description covers both realms of truth and estimation on the one hand, and both prospective and retrospective standpoints on the other hand. This partition distinguishes between four views of maritime routes, namely true prospective, prospective estimated, true retrospective and retrospective estimated that are further described in the paper. Besides identifying and characterising the different perspectives, this classification also conciliates the different notions of maritime route used across domains, and provides a basis for a shared conceptualisation amongst data scientists and navigation practitioners.","Semantics,navigation practitioners,prospective,control engineering computing,marine navigation,data science,data analysis,maritime route,semantics,maritime navigation,Oceans,maritime domain,retrospective,Ontologies,data scientists,maritime routes,Navigation,Surveillance,complementary views,Estimation,Analytical models,"
"air quality across a european hotspot: spatial gradients, seasonality, diurnal cycles and trends in the veneto region, ne italy","2017","The Veneto region (NE Italy) lies in the eastern part of the Po Valley, a European hotspot for air pollution. Data for key air pollutants (CO, NO, NO2, O3, SO2, PM10 and PM2.5) measured over 7years (2008/2014) across 43 sites in Veneto were processed to characterise their spatial and temporal patterns and assess the air quality. Nitrogen oxides, PM and ozone are critical pollutants frequently breaching the EC limit and target values. Intersite analysis demonstrates a widespread pollution across the region and shows that primary pollutants (nitrogen oxides, CO, PM) are significantly higher in cities and over the flat lands due to higher anthropogenic pressures. The spatial variation of air pollutants at rural sites was then mapped to depict the gradient of background pollution: nitrogen oxides are higher in the plain area due to the presence of strong diffuse anthropogenic sources, while ozone increases toward the mountains probably due to the higher levels of biogenic ozone-precursors and low NO emissions which are not sufficient to titrate out the photochemical O3. Data-depth classification analysis revealed a poor categorization among urban, traffic and industrial sites: weather and urban planning factors may cause a general homogeneity of air pollution within cities driving this poor classification. Seasonal and diurnal cycles were investigated: the effect of primary sources in populated areas is evident throughout the region and drives similar patterns for most pollutants: road traffic appears the predominant potential source shaping the daily cycles. Trend analysis of experimental data reveals a general decrease of air pollution across the region, which agrees well with changes assessed by emission inventories. This study provides key information on air quality across NE Italy and highlights future research needs and possible developments of the regional monitoring network.","Nitrogen oxides,Veneto,Trends,Air pollution,Particulate matter,"
"societal need for improved understanding of climate change, anthropogenic impacts, and geo-hazard warning drive development of ocean observatories in european seas","2011","Society’s needs for a network of in situ ocean observing systems cross many areas of earth and marine science. Here we review the science themes that benefit from data supplied from ocean observatories. Understanding from existing studies is fragmented to the extent that it lacks the coherent long-term monitoring needed to address questions at the scales essential to understand climate change and improve geo-hazard early warning. Data sets from the deep sea are particularly rare with long-term data available from only a few locations worldwide. These science areas have impacts on societal health and well-being and our awareness of ocean function in a shifting climate. Substantial efforts are underway to realise a network of open-ocean observatories around European Seas that will operate over multiple decades. Some systems are already collecting high-resolution data from surface, water column, seafloor, and sub-seafloor sensors linked to shore by satellite or cable connection in real or near-real time, along with samples and other data collected in a delayed mode. We expect that such observatories will contribute to answering major ocean science questions including: How can monitoring of factors such as seismic activity, pore fluid chemistry and pressure, and gas hydrate stability improve seismic, slope failure, and tsunami warning? What aspects of physical oceanography, biogeochemical cycling, and ecosystems will be most sensitive to climatic and anthropogenic change? What are natural versus anthropogenic changes? Most fundamentally, how are marine processes that occur at differing scales related? The development of ocean observatories provides a substantial opportunity for ocean science to evolve in Europe. Here we also describe some basic attributes of network design. Observatory networks provide the means to coordinate and integrate the collection of standardised data capable of bridging measurement scales across a dispersed area in European Seas adding needed certainty to estimates of future oceanic conditions. Observatory data can be analysed along with other data such as those from satellites, drifting floats, autonomous underwater vehicles, model analysis, and the known distribution and abundances of marine fauna in order to address some of the questions posed above. Standardised methods for information management are also becoming established to ensure better accessibility and traceability of these data sets and ultimately to increase their use for societal benefit. The connection of ocean observatory effort into larger frameworks including the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) and the Global Monitoring of Environment and Security (GMES) is integral to its success. It is in a greater integrated framework that the full potential of the component systems will be realised.",""
"an evaluation of volcanic cloud detection techniques during recent significant eruptions in the western ‘ring of fire’","2004","We examined recent volcanic cloud events in the Western Pacific and Indonesian area, to validate the performance of remote sensing techniques used to support the International Airways Volcano Watch (IAVW). Five events were considered, during which eruptions from eight volcanoes injected ash into the upper troposphere or lower stratosphere. For one of the eruptions, at Miyakejima, Japan, at least five aircraft encountered volcanic ash clouds, and the cost to three operators alone exceeded US $12,000,000 in aircraft repairs, diversions, and lost operating time. We performed ‘reverse’ absorption and ‘pattern analysis’ using GMS-5/VISSR, MODIS and AVHRR data, and we examined TOMS SO2 and Aerosol Index data, surface-based observations, pilot reports, and dispersion model output. Our results verify that the introduction of ‘reverse’ absorption using the geostationary GMS-5 platform significantly enhanced our capacity to monitor volcanic ash clouds in the region. In one case, we tracked an eruption cloud for approximately 80 h. The primary impediment to remote monitoring is the presence of overlying cloud, or substantial amounts of ice within the volcanic clouds. TOMS data showed success in identifying volcanic clouds during these conditions, but was limited by the infrequency of observations. More effective future operation of the IAVW relies on developing complementary methods of volcanic cloud remote sensing, and greatly increasing the amount and quality of available surface and air observations, including observations of precursor activity. An understanding of the likely future limitations of remote sensing techniques will aid in the refining of IAVW procedures.","Volcanic eruptions,Satellite remote sensing,Aviation safety,Volcanic ash detection,"

"implementing vital dynamic capabilities to succeed in digital transformation: a multiple-case study in maritime container shipping","2022","Dynamic capabilities (DCs) were found to be a success factor in maritime container shipping (MCS) regarding the volatile future, leading to competitive advantages in digital transformation (DT) efforts. Despite its relevance, it remains unclear which DCs are vital for incumbent maritime organizations to succeed in DT and how DCs need to be implemented to enable DT. Referring to this research gap, this article is the first to empirically classify digital sensing, seizing, and transforming capabilities and uncover antecedents relevant to these capabilities. Thereby, we initially combine the DCs view with DT efforts in MCS, providing valuable insights for decision-makers in port authorities, carriers, and freight forwarders. Answers were sought through a cross-case analysis involving 26 experts along the maritime supply chain. The findings highlight strategic agility, innovation ecosystems, and the redesign of organizational structures the most vital second-order concepts for succeeding in DT in MCS. Implementing the identified DCs in MCS is of considerable strategic relevance, advancing the transformation of MCS into a digitalized, efficient, and sustainable industry that preliminary provides service-based offers to its customers. Consequently, this article presents a strategic basis for adapting DT roadmaps and investments in MCS, preparing incumbent MCS organizations for the digital future.","Interviews,Seaports,Technological innovation,freight transportation,maritime,Container,digital sensing,Containers,digital transforming (DT),digital seizing,Industries,Logistics,digitalization,dynamic capabilities (DCs),Organizations,"
"a new road safety indicator based on vehicle trajectory analysis","2016","In 2014, in France, accidents on rural roads accounted for roughly 63% of road mortality (ONISR, 2014). Yet, the locations of accidents are increasingly spread, and it is becoming difficult for road managers to set priorities for interventions on their road network. They can no longer base their strategy on accident analysis. Road managers need to quickly measure the effectiveness of a modified facility, improvement of facilities or modification of the environment. On this type of site accident analysis requires a period of 3 to 5 years to determine the effectiveness of a change. This period of time does not meet the requirements of road managers or road users. To provide a high safety level, managers are implementing innovative developments: wall effect chicane at crossroads, dynamic warning signs, rural roundabouts, etc. Managers want to quickly assess these innovations. In addition, they have less and less money, so it is necessary to give them tools to help prioritize their intervention. It is also preferable for road managers to take preventive action rather than having to wait for accidents or serious injuries to occur, in order to carry out diagnosis and propose countermeasures. In this article, we propose a new safety indicator based on trajectory analysis. By trajectory, we mean a time-function that describes vehicle movement including not only its path on the road but also speeds and accelerations in both horizontal directions (longitudinal and transverse). These trajectories describe vehicle/infrastructure/driver interactions and reveal inadequacies that can lead to accidents. These trajectories are obtained using two roadside observation systems that analyse vehicle trajectories on two specific locations: curves and intersections on rural roads. The first tool is a local trajectory measurement system. It records trajectories of all vehicles passing through a specific zone. The goal is to observe abnormal paths that reveal dysfunctions in the vehicle/Infrastructure/driver system. The main applications-related contribution of this work focuses on developing a comprehensive solution for accurately estimating vehicle trajectories based on a combination of video images and range finder (telemeter) measurements. The purpose of the second tool is to improve understanding of dysfunctions at a crossroads and to evaluate the effectiveness of facilities. A precise study of patterns encountered on accident-prone intersections on rural roads showed that some situations are much more dangerous and frequent than others. In particular, most accidents at intersections are caused by vehicles crossing main roads. The second system presented in this paper detects and records conflicts between users on the secondary road who are crossing the main road, and users driving straight ahead on the main road. This kind of conflict represents the main type of accidents called crossing at grade accidents. The proposed risk indicator is equal to the number of conflicts (near-misses), weighted by the severity of the conflicts recorded in a given period. We chose to take the number of conflicts per hour. The purpose of these tools is to understand anomalies in the vehicle/infrastructure/driver system, and to evaluate the effectiveness of countermeasures on safety. Associated with risk indicators they make it possible to objectively assess driver behaviours with respect to the road infrastructure.","safety,trajectories,curves,intersections,evaluation,"

Digitalization is one of the enablers of autonomous operation, with installing new sensors and using the data for AI and machine learning. The trend is to move the handling the vast amount of data from sensors, installed in machines, and devices, close to the sensors. This way, data communication can be heavily reduced, while the latency of decisions based on data can be minimal. This is achieved by moving the advanced data analysis capabilities from the cloud to the edge. In this paper, the driver of technological development is the concept of an unmanned machine room, where the normal inspections performed by personnel are automated using sensors and algorithms.We present an analysis of vibration data, recorded at a cruise ferry\x92s engines, using a signal processing method called cepstrums. A cepstrum is a version of frequency analysis, intending to identify and visualize periodic structures in data using cepstrograms. Compared to spectrogram analysis, usage of cepstrogram enables better visualization of engine behavior into the shape of audio signals. This helped us discover the run-time vibration routine of the engines from where we could observe unusual vibration sensing generated from the engine.

"ship trajectory prediction based on machine learning and deep learning: a systematic review and methods analysis","2023","Ship trajectory prediction based on Automatic Identification System (AIS) data has attracted increasing interest as it helps prevent collision accidents and eliminate potential navigational conflicts. Therefore, it is necessary and urgent to conduct a systematic analysis of all the prediction methods to help reveal their advantages to ensure safety at sea in different scenarios. It is particularly important and significant within the context of unmanned ships forming a new hybrid maritime traffic together with manned ships in the future. This paper aims to conduct a comparative analysis of the up-to-date ship trajectory prediction algorithms based on machine learning and deep learning methods. To do so, five classical machine learning methods (i.e., Kalman Filter, Gaussian Process Regression, Support Vector Regression, Random Forest, and Back Propagation Network) and eight deep learning methods (i.e., Recurrent Neural Networks, Long Short-Term Memory, Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory, Gate Recurrent Unit, Bi-directional Gate Recurrent Unit, Sequence to Sequence, Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network, and Transformer) are thoroughly analysed and compared from the algorithm essence and applications to excavate their features and adaptability for manned and unmanned ships. The findings reveal the characteristics of various prediction methods and provide valuable implications for different stakeholders to guide the best-fit choice of a particular method as the solution under a specific circumstance. It also makes contributions to the extraction of the research difficulties of ship trajectory prediction and the corresponding solutions that are put forward to guide the development of future research.","Deep learning,Maritime safety,Hybrid maritime traffic,Trajectory prediction,AIS data,Machine learning,"

"green, grey and black: a comparative study of sierra de las navajas (mexico) and lipari (italy) obsidians","2018","Sierra de Las Navajas (State of Hidalgo, Mexico) and Lipari (Aeolian Islands, Italy) were among the most important sources for obsidian trade in Mesoamerica and in the Mediterranean during the Stone Age. In this paper obsidians from these two localities were compared in terms of their aspect, chemical composition, microcrystallinity and microvesiculation. In Sierra de las Navajas, the typical deep green obsidian with a golden hue has been analyzed together with a less common dark grey, porphyritic variety. Lipari obsidian is commonly black, but a light grey variety also occurs. Obsidian of both varieties was analyzed for this paper. Microvesicularity was investigated through Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) observation, microporosimetry and, for Sierra de las Navajas green obsidian, through a preliminary X-ray computed microtomographic study. Crystallinity and micro- or nano-crystallinity were investigated through X-Ray Powder Diffraction and EDS (Energy Dispersion System) microanalyses. Finally, the chemical composition in terms of major and trace elements, including rare earth elements, was determined using X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) and Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS). The comparison of samples of different colors suggests that the characteristic green color of Sierra de las Navajas obsidians could be related to their relatively high iron content, and to the occurrence of many elongated and iso-oriented vesicles which may also be responsible for the obsidian's golden hue. Low iron and an absence of vesicles give Lipari obsidian its “normal” black color. The light grey obsidian from Lipari probably owes its color and imperfect conchoidal fracture to numerous bubbles of less than 1 μm in size and to nano-crystallinity. Sierra de las Navajas obsidians show a significant chemical variability in terms of trace elements, that can be explained by common evolutionary processes in the magma chamber. However, this variability is also internal to a single volcanic complex and this makes the trace element contents unsuitable to differentiating between the different sub-sources of the same area. On Lipari, our data do not allow us to distinguish between the two sub-sources of Vallone del Gabellotto and Canneto Dentro on the basis of major and trace elements. On the whole, our study suggests that caution should be used for both Lipari and Sierra de las Navajas when identifying obsidian sub-sources on the basis of trace element contents.","Sierra de las Navajas (Mexico),XRF and ICP-MS analyses,Obsidian source analyses,Lipari (Aeolian Islands),Obsidian color,Microvesiculation,Microtexture,"
"global sensitivity of radar wave propagation power to environmental variables for a parabolic equation numerical simulation in maritime regions","2015","Numerous environmental factors impact radio wave propagation in the marine atmospheric boundary layer (MABL) through effects such as scattering and refraction. Furthermore, environmental parameters can interact with each other to either compound or reduce the impact of each individual parameter. Thus, in order to properly assess the sensitivity of radar wave propagation power to environmental variables a global sensitivity approach is needed. In this study, we examine the global sensitivity of propagation power to a number of environmental variables using a parabolic equation (PE) numerical simulation for maritime regions. The sensitivity analysis is performed using the Extended Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Test, which is a global variance-based method that can account for multi-degree interaction effects. The method is ideal for complex nonlinear models and permits computation of both leading order and total order sensitivity for each parameter. The study examines 16 environmental parameters, 8 sea state and 8 atmospheric, that are used to generate inputs for the Variable Terrain Radiowave Parabolic Equation (VTRPE) numerical simulation. This model uses a split-step rotated Green's function parabolic wave equation solution to the scalar wave equation for transverse field components derived from Maxwell's equations. The simulation accounts for effects of refraction (including ducting) as well as variable boundary conditions on water surfaces, such as wind seas, swell, and variable dielectric properties. Vertical profiles of atmospheric refractivity, which are assumed homogenous in range for this study, are generated using a simplified refractivity model that depends on the 8 atmospheric parameters and can generate linear refractivity profiles as well as evaporation, surface, and elevated ducts, including any combination of these ducts. Sea state parameters can be grouped into 3 general categories: surface dielectric properties, directionality, and surface roughness. Atmospheric parameters can be grouped into 4 general categories: evaporation layer, mixed layer, inversion layer, and upper layer parameters. We examine results in the context of these parameter groupings.",""

Firstly, analyzes the MDG ontology and then describe the concepts, individuals, properties, the relationship between concepts and individuals of MDG in detail based on ontology. Furthermore, a method and model for constructing the knowledge graph of maritime dangerous goods (KGMDG) are proposed. Finally, its possible application is explored in this paper. The KGMDG is able to work out the correlation between goods, and provides technical support for intelligent inquiry of MDG knowledge and automatic judgment of stowage and segregation.

"maritime radar target detection using neural networks","1995","Two neural network based maritime radar target detection systems are presented: one is based on a backpropagation (BP) network and the other on the combination of a principal component analysis (PCA) network and a BP network. Using maritime radar images as inputs, both systems include a pre-processing stage, a BP network classification stage and a post-processing stage. In the PCA+BP network based system, an extra PCA network is used for compacting test patterns. Experimental results show that: (a) for the BP network based system, the overall detection rate is 95.3%; (b) for the PCA+BP network based system, the same overall detection rate can be reached with a reduced number of false-alarms; (c) as the number of components of compacted data from the PCA network is reduced, the overall detection rate is maintained at nearly the same level; and (d) compared with a conventional mean-level constant false-alarm rate detector, the two neural network based systems can provide higher overall detection rates while maintaining a lower number of false-alarms.","test patterns,radar detection,neural networks,Neural networks,transforms,Principal component analysis,experimental results,neural nets,marine systems,radar computing,maritime radar images,Artificial neural networks,false alarms,preprocessing stage,postprocessing stage,maritime radar target detection systems,radar imaging,Artificial intelligence,Radar clutter,backpropagation network,detection rate,principal component analysis network,Radar imaging,backpropagation network classifier,Object detection,Surveillance,Detectors,Radar detection,backpropagation,"
"a holistic provenance and microwear study of pre-colonial jade objects from the virgin islands: unravelling mobility networks in the wider caribbean","2022","Pre-colonial Caribbean jade objects from the National Museum of Denmark Hatt Collection were subjected to a provenance and microwear analysis. Thirty-nine jade celts and bodily ornaments from the US Virgin Islands, i.e., St. Croix, St. Thomas, St. John, and five celts from the West Indies of unknown location, St. Vincent, Cuba and the Dominican Republic were analysed. A comprehensive in-depth examination of jade adornments from St. Croix, combining typo-technological and microwear analysis, is compared to other lithologies used for pre-colonial ornaments. A portable laser ablation system was used to sample jade celts and bodily ornaments on site in a quasi-non-destructive manner. Low-blank trace element and Sr-Nd isotope ratio data were evaluated with a multiclass regression provenance prediction model. This study demonstrates that the pan-Caribbean exchange of jade raw materials, pre-forms or finished objects during the Ceramic Age (400 BC to AD 1492) occurred on a more complex scale than previously thought involving jade sources in Guatemala, eastern Cuba and the northern Dominican Republic. In addition, the study of ornaments recovered from St. Croix reveals use of specific lithologies suggesting stronger ties to Indigenous communities on Puerto Rico than other Lesser Antillean Islands.","Microwear analysis,Portable laser ablation sampling,Mobility networks,Provenance analyses,Pre-colonial jade artefacts,Virgin Islands,"

"maritime opportunistic transmission: when and how much can dtn node deliver?","2019","Maritime wireless communication delay tolerant networks (MWDTN) may develop slowly, if there is no efficient scheme to allocate network resources which are arrival data and limited energy. In this paper, we investigate the resources scheduling problem to utilize the sleeping scheduling (SS) and opportunistic transmission (OT) for energy conservation, while guaranteeing the Quality-of-Service (QoS) with worst-case delay. In addition, we assume the node of delay tolerant networks (DTN) only uses green energy absorbed from the sun and wind. We establish a reasonable harvest-and-consumption energy model. Considering to make a delay-energy tradeoff, an optimization algorithm based on Lyapunov optimization (LO), which makes the transmission determination for waking-up the DTN node and determines the optimal data quantity should be transmitted for current system state, is proposed to cope with the delay-energy tradeoff problem.

"a novel quality control method of time-series ocean wave observation data combining deep-learning prediction and statistical analysis","2023","Quality control (QC) of marine data is a critical aspect in ensuring the usability of oceanic data. In this paper, we propose a novel QC method for time-series ocean wave data, which combines deep learning prediction and statistical analysis. Our method first realizes multi-element LSTM prediction of the time-series ocean wave observation data, capturing both temporal consistency and physical relationships between the multi-element inputs. Then, it applies peak detection on the regional mean difference ratio derived from the predicted and true values of the ocean wave data, and finally labels the anomalous data points based on peak detection results. We conducted experiments on the time-series wave data of four sites from the National Marine Science Center, China, and compared our proposed method with traditional QC method that is currently used for operational marine data quality control, as well as classic anomaly detection models including Isolation Forest and VAE-LSTM. The results show a significant improvement in the Precision, Recall, and F1 Score for erroneous samples using our proposed method.

"atmospheric river linked to extreme rainfall events over kerala in august 2018","2021","A multi-day atmospheric river (AR) in the second week of August 2018 was pivotal in causing extreme precipitation over south-west coast of India that eventually lead to record-breaking floods in the state of Kerala. Integrated water vapor transport (IVT) analysis depicted an intense and long-duration CAT 5 atmospheric river stretching from the Arabian Sea across South India into the Bay of Bengal. A high-pressure ridge over the eastern Arabian Sea and western India and a trough over the Bay of Bengal forming a subsection of monsoon wave-train was observed ahead of the flood event. The monsoon trough was exacerbated by the synchronous effect of a polar westerly jet trough that created an anomalous low-pressure region covering central and eastern India and a quasi-stationary depression over the Bay of Bengal. The system favored continuous supply of moisture from the Indian Ocean into Kerala. To locate major sources of moisture, the air parcels that rained out to generate extreme precipitation are tracked backwards using the Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory model (HYSPLIT). The backward trajectory analyses reveal that on 13th August more than 60% of the moisture was contributed from the Central-Eastern Indian Ocean, with some intermittent contributions from the Arabian Sea; while on 14th–16th August, about 25–30% was contributed from the Arabian Sea",""
"an integrated dynamic ship risk model based on bayesian networks and evidential reasoning","2021","The paper proposes a probabilistic framework for assessing the risk of ships based on a hybrid approach and multiple data sources. A Bayes-based network learning approach uses data from the New Inspection Regime of the Paris MoU on Port State Control to characterise the relationships among risk parameters and uses these parameters to evaluate the ship static risk. Other data sources are used to develop a Bayesian Network model to assess the dynamic risk of the ship. The data is aggregated by Bayesian Network and Evidential Reasoning approaches to evaluate the overall risk of ships in coastal waters. The objective of the study is to develop a model to assess the risk of an individual ship by considering its static risk profile and the geographical-dependant risk factors related to the characteristics of the maritime traffic flow and other local characteristics that influence the navigational risk of the ship. The results show that the integrated approach is able to assess the overall risk of a ship based on multiple data sources, providing empirical evidence of using multiple data sources in risk analysis applications. Moreover, the developed model identifies the most critical circumstances and the key impact factors in the study waters, which can support decisions on risk prevention and mitigation measures and local maritime traffic management.","Evidential Reasoning,Rule-based approach,Static and dynamic ship risk,Bayesian Networks,Automatic identification system data,Port State Control inspection data,Maritime risk analysis,"

Significant scientific interest has come up in the last decades, as numerous lightning detection networks have been established in operational basis, providing lightning data to assess and mitigate lightning impact to the local society by spatio-temporal analysis. In this study, a preliminary analysis of spatial and temporal variabilities of recorded lightnings over Greece during the period from January 2008 to December 2009 is presented. The data for retrieving the location and time-of-occurrence (TOA) of lightning were acquired from the Hellenic National Meteorological Service (HNMS). An operational precision lightning network (PLN) has been established since 2007 by HNMS, consisting of eight time-of-arrival (TOA) sensors, spatially distributed across Greek territory. The spatial variability of lightnings revealed their incidence within specific geographical sub-regions while the temporal variability concerns the seasonal and monthly distributions. All the analyses were carried out with respect to cloud to cloud (CC), cloud to ground (CG) and ground to cloud (GC) lightnings, within the examined time period. During the autumn season, lightning activity was the highest, followed by summer and spring.

The spatial and seasonal variability of DCS occurrence have been investigated, as well as the most favourable synoptic precursors for their initiation. The analysis has shown the existence of some preferential areas of DCS genesis, mainly located in the western (i.e., around Balearic Islands) and central (i.e., Ionic and Tyrrhenian seas) Mediterranean, where these systems develop and grow preferentially in fall (i.e., September and October). The analysis of a selected set of Synoptic Precursors (SPs) has shown how the totality of the identified cases has occurred downstream a mid-tropospheric (500hPa) disturbance (trough or cut-off) within a southerly flow, with high values of θe (at 850hPa) and precipitable water. Moreover, the approaching of an upper level tropopause dynamical anomaly coupled with a local maximum of upper and low level horizontal wind speed, seems to play a very important role in triggering convection. Finally, a careful crosscheck of the detected cases with the ESWD reports has allowed to investigate the severity of these systems, as they often affect population and produce significant damages. This study has to be considered a necessary step towards the development of a larger climatologic database of long-lasting, deep convective events occurring in the Mediterranean sea, as well as the definition of a specific conceptual model based on synoptic precursors, having the long-term issue of setting up an objective procedure to support regional meteorological services in early decisions and accurate nowcasting.","Severe weather reports,Synoptic precursors,Deep convective systems,Mediterranean basin,Satellite imagery,"

"multi-air pollution risk assessment in southeast asia region using integrated remote sensing and socio-economic data products","2023","Air pollution has massive impacts on human life and poor air quality results in three million deaths annually. Air pollution can result from natural causes, including volcanic eruptions and extreme droughts, or human activities, including motor vehicle emissions, industry, and the burning of farmland and forests. Emission sources emit multiple pollutant types with diverse characteristics and impacts. However, there has been little research on the risk of multiple air pollutants; thus, it is difficult to identify multi-pollutant mitigation processes, particularly in Southeast Asia, where air pollution moves dynamically across national borders. In this study, the main objective was to develop a multi-air pollution risk index product for CO, NO2, and SO2 based on Sentinel-5P remote sensing data from 2019 to 2020. The risk index was developed by integrating hazard, vulnerability, and exposure analyses. Hazard analysis considers air pollution data from remote sensing, vulnerability analysis considers the air pollution sources, and exposure analysis considers the population density. The novelty of this study lies in its development of a multi-risk model that considers the weights obtained from the relationship between the hazard and vulnerability parameters. The highest air pollution risk index values were observed in urban areas, with a high exposure index that originates from pollution caused by human activity. Multi-risk analysis of the three air pollutants revealed that Singapore, Vietnam, and the Philippines had the largest percentages of high-risk areas, while Indonesia had the largest total high-risk area (4361 km2). Using the findings of this study, the patterns and characteristics of the risk distribution of multiple air pollutants in Southeast Asia can be identified, which can be used to mitigate multi-pollutant sources, particularly with respect to supporting the clean air targets in the Sustainable Development Goals.","Southeast Asia,Risk hazard model,Air quality,Multi-source air pollution,Sentinel 5P,"
"routeminer: mining ship routes from a massive maritime trajectories","2014","Mining trajectory data has been attracting significant interest in the last years. By analyzing trajectory data, we are able to discover the movement behavior and location-aware knowledge, and then develop many interesting applications such as movement behavior discovery, location prediction, traffic analysis, and so on. However, trajectory data mining is a challenge task because of the trajectory data is available with uncertainty. Furthermore, discovering the valuable knowledge from maritime trajectory is made even more difficult due to the maritime area is a free moving space. Unlike the vehicles' movements are constrained by road networks, there is no such a sea route for ships to follow in maritime area. A ship's movement may not exactly repeat the same trajectory even the ship has the similar movement behavior with others. In this work, Route Miner system provides a framework of ship route mining for maritime traffic analysis. Given a set of ship trajectories in a maritime area, Route Miner explore the movement behavior from those massive trajectories in a free moving space. Then, ship routes are detected based on those behavioral pattern. Finally, the system generates a set of ships routes to provide operators a better understanding from ship trajectory data. We conduct the experiments on real maritime trajectories to show the effectiveness of proposed Route Miner. In the future, Route Miner is going to serve as the photo type for exploring the solutions of the challenges those related to anomaly detection and traffic management in the maritime domain.","data mining,Vectors,movement behavior,anomaly detection,Marine vehicles,movement behavior discovery,traffic management,ship trajectories,Trajectory Data Mining,mining ship routes,ship route mining,Ship Route Mining,marine systems,maritime trajectories,Vehicles,trajectory data analysis,route miner system,Maritime Trajectory,trajectory data mining,maritime domain,behavioral pattern,maritime traffic analysis,Roads,location prediction,Trajectory,massive maritime trajectories,Uncertainty,road networks,Data mining,maritime area,location-aware knowledge,"

Then it uses the information from other sensors in order to reduce the number of generated proposals by SS and find more dense proposals. Finally, the class of objects within the final proposals are identified by Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

"chemical and radiological detection using uavâ€™s with atex compliance: proof of concept in port and maritime incident-based scenarios","2018","Nowadays, oceans represent a very important part of our economies, as ways of communication between countries and because of the resources they contain, making their safety and protection major concerns that we all face. Because of this, there are several threats which must be dealt with. One of these threats are the Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) agents. In this framework, the development of technologies with the potential to increase the capabilities for detection of pollutants or toxic materials and situational awareness plays a significant role in the case of events in the scope of maritime accidents, pollution or port safety and security. These scenarios can pose substantial challenges to the operations, due to their complexity, and the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) is increasingly becoming ubiquitous in this context. This paper is focused in operation environment demonstrations, which aimed to validate the operational feasibility of the concept simulating two different scenarios; chemical and radiological.

In this regard, this paper proposes a hierarchical principal component analysis (PCA) fault detection method based on the differential features of dynamic faults to detect the fault with ZCPs. The main contribution of this work are as follows: (1) A new differential based feature extraction method is first proposed to well character the dynamic trend of the observation; (2) then, a hierarchical detection criterion is proposed according to the detection ability of each round of PCA anomaly detection; (3) it is convenient to extend the proposed method to other statistical based fault detection techniques whose detection criteria are also a distance defined by fault amplitude.","Hierarchical PCA,Differential feature,Zero cross point,Dynamic fault,"

"adaptive parameter identification of maritime autonomous surface ships with exponential convergence","2021","This paper is concerned with the parameter identification of maritime autonomous surface ships (MASS) with fully unknown coefficients. An adaptive parameter identification method is proposed for an MASS to identify its model without the condition of the persistence of excitation (PE). Specifically, a composite adaptive update law is developed based on an integral filtering regression equation. By using this method, only the initial excitation (IE) condition is needed to assure the estimation convergence. A salient feature of the proposed method is that the acceleration information is totally not needed and only measured linear velocities and yaw rate are used for identification. Then, the stability of the online parameter identification method is proved by Lyapunov stability analysis, and the estimation errors exponentially converge to zero. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive parameter identification method for the MASS.","initial excitation condition,stability,Mathematical models,adaptive parameter identification method,maritime autonomous surface ships,Lyapunov methods,Stability analysis,online parameter identification method,Parameter estimation,ships,initially excitation,adaptive control,parameter identification,nonlinear control systems,Adaptation models,estimation convergence,maritime autonomous surface ship,Velocity measurement,fully unknown coefficients,Simulation,exponential convergence,parameter estimation,Damping,composite adaptive update law,"
"understanding the management of cyber resilient systems","2020","The digital age characterizes the 21-century by the widespread and conscious use of Information Technology, originating the need for organizations to protect one of the most critical and valuable resources: information. Cyber security was born to protect information systems from cyber-attacks. Organizational resilience refers to the ability of a system to adapt to a change: a very contemporary concept that is finding more and more importance in our continuously changing society, assuming also a greater relevance in the cyber context. Therefore, the ability of organizations to react to cyber-attacks and to evolve to a new robustness after successful outbreaks recalls the concept of resilience and brings to the evolution of this concept into that of cyber resilience. In order to offer a deep insight on the management of cyber resilient systems and to propose a Managerial Cyber Resilience Framework, clarifying the role of context in the correct selection and implementation of different tools and practices, we conducted an exploratory multiple case study analysis in six companies operating in three different industries: consultancy, public administration and banking.

"non-radial dea model: a new approach to evaluation of safety at railway level crossings","2018","Railway level crossings (RLCs) are critical points characterized by a large number of accidents per year due to the intersection of railway and roadway infrastructures. The improvement of safety at RLCs is of crucial importance worldwide. This paper proposes a new approach for evaluating safety at RLCs using non-radial DEA (Data Envelopment Analysis) model. The introduced non-radial DEA model is employed for the evaluation of railway efficiency of European countries regarding the level of safety at RLCs through considering desirable and undesirable inputs, as well as desirable and undesirable outputs for the period from 2010 to 2012 and for the year 2014. Due to missing the comprehensive set of data for roadway traffic, the evaluation of safety at railway RLCs has been conducted from railway viewpoint. Through the application of modified non-radial DEA model, results indicate the most efficient countries, as well as countries with a lower efficiency of railway performance in terms of the level of safety at RLCs. In order to check the validity of modified non-radial DEA model, comparison of results and sensitivity analysis were conducted. Despite the validity, results of the sensitivity analysis indicated also some weaknesses of the modified non-radial DEA model related to missing and inaccurate data, the number of variables included, and the selection of inputs and outputs. A modified non-radial DEA model, as proposed in the paper, with overall set of data can be used for evaluating the efficiency of safety improvement at RLCs, efficiency of different countermeasures before and after implementation at RLCs of different.","Sensitivity analysis,Evaluation,Safety,Non-radial DEA model,Efficiency,Railway level crossing,Validation,"

In 2006 a mussel watch survey was developed for the Portuguese coast (total of 29 sampling sites) in order to describe the concentrations of BuTs , PhTs, OcTs and SnT in the whole tissues of Mytilus galloprovincialis (Lamarck, 1819). BuTs were detected in all analyzed samples accounting, in average, for 98.6% of total organotins (∑OTs=BuTs+PhTs+OcTs), and presented highest values in the vicinity of harbors. Tributyltin (TBT) was the dominant butyltin, representing, in average, 62% of ∑BuTs (∑BuTs=TBT+DBT+MBT) suggesting that fresh inputs of TBT are still occurring in the Portuguese coast, particularly near harbors. The contribution of organotin compounds derived from antifouling paints to the total tin levels in M. galloprovincialis is discussed.","Portuguese coast,Total tin,Tributyltin,"
"outlier detection approach for discovering anomalous maritime profiles","2023","Maritime authorities play a key role in ensuring the safety and security of shipping lanes and ports. The port state control mechanism enables these authorities to physically verify suspect vessels (e.g., involved in smuggling or piracy events), but choosing the most relevant vessels to be inspected represents a challenging task. This decision can be enhanced by AI-powered systems that analyse large amounts of data, identify patterns and report all observed discrepancies. This paper presents a statistical analysis on the temporal durations of four types of naval statuses: sailing, docked in port, waiting at anchor and not transmitting AIS data. These durations were extracted from the historical activity of different classes of vessels that passed the Black Sea region (Romanian Exclusive Economic Zone) in 2022. Probability density functions were built for these vessels and all statuses' durations were fitted into known parametric distributions. Finally, the paper shows the results of multiple outlier detection algorithms that searched for anomalous data in a multivariate manner.","shipping lanes,probability density functions,Electric potential,Safety,unsupervised learning,naval statuses,public administration,Black Sea region,maritime authorities,outlier detection,Probability density function,temporal durations,port state control,statistical analysis,ships,port state control mechanism,marine safety,marine engineering,observed discrepancies,anomalous maritime profiles,AIS,Seaports,historical activity,Artificial intelligence,sea ports,maritime anomaly detection,Statistical analysis,anomalous data,smuggling,AIS data,Romanian exclusive economic zone,outlier detection approach,probability,AI-powered systems,Security,production engineering computing,data handling,suspect vessels,"
"the system theoretic accident modelling and process (stamp) of medical pilot knock-out events: pilot incapacitation and homicide-suicide","2018","After the Germanwings flight 4U9525, mental health issues of pilots have been raised as a hazard to flight safety. Pilot homicide-suicide, as a special subtype of pilot incapacitation, can be examined at different levels of commercial aviation. We extended the System Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA), based on the System Theoretic Accident Modelling and Process (STAMP), to pilot behaviour to investigate how these knock-out events may be encountered in the whole system. Several safety actions have been identified to prevent hazardous pilot behaviour caused by medical incapacitation and homicidal-suicidal behaviour at different levels of the system. Pilot incapacitation is already handled very well in practice with respect to the regulations and procedures in current usage. In contrast, the prevention of pilot homicide-suicide is currently managed by aeromedical decision-making regulations and pilot support programs. The design of the flight deck compartment door and the balancing of privacy laws and public safety remain trade-offs amid a medical risk.","STPA,STAMP,Suicide,Pilot incapacitation,Accident modelling,Homicide,"
"contextual anomaly detection in crowded surveillance scenes","2014","This work addresses the problem of detecting human behavioural anomalies in crowded surveillance environments. We focus in particular on the problem of detecting subtle anomalies in a behaviourally heterogeneous surveillance scene. To reach this goal we implement a novel unsupervised context-aware process. We propose and evaluate a method of utilising social context and scene context to improve behaviour analysis. We find that in a crowded scene the application of Mutual Information based social context permits the ability to prevent self-justifying groups and propagate anomalies in a social network, granting a greater anomaly detection capability. Scene context uniformly improves the detection of anomalies in both datasets. The strength of our contextual features is demonstrated by the detection of subtly abnormal behaviours, which otherwise remain indistinguishable from normal behaviour.","Behaviour analysis,Context,Visual surveillance,Security,"

Our algorithms take real-time tracking information and learn motion pattern models on-the-fly, enabling the models to adapt well to evolving situations while maintaining high levels of performance. The constantly refined models, resulting from concurrent incremental learning, are used to evaluate the behavior patterns of vessels based on their present motion states. At the event level, learning provides the capability to detect (and alert) upon anomalous behavior. At a higher (inter-event) level, learning enables predictions, over pre-defined time horizons, to be made about future vessel location. Predictions can also be used to alert on anomalous behavior.

"temporal changes in atmospheric mercury concentrations at a background mountain site downwind of the east asia continent in 2006–2016","2019","Atmospheric mercury (Hg) has been monitored at the Lulin Atmospheric Background Station (LABS) in Taiwan since April 2006 and is still continuing. Here we reported the trend in gaseous elemental Hg (GEM) concentrations at LABS between April 2006 and December 2016, before the Minamata Convention on Mercury entered into force in 2017. Previous research indicated nighttime (0–8 am) data collected at LABS are better representative of regional influence. Therefore, only nighttime GEM data were used for trend analysis. A significant decreasing trend in GEM at a rate of −1.5% yr−1 (−0.022 ng m−3 yr−1, p < 0.01) was found, comparable to the decreasing trends observed in Europe, North America, South Africa, and over the North Atlantic Ocean. Five major GEM source regions to the LABS were identified, including northern Indochina Peninsula, China, Northeast Asia, the Pacific Ocean, and South China Sea. Significant decreasing trends in GEM were found for air masses coming from northern Indochina Peninsula (−0.042 ng m−3 yr−1, −2.6% yr−1, p < 0.01), China (−0.041 ng m−3 yr−1, −2.4% yr−1, p < 0.01), Northeast Asia (−0.031 ng m−3 yr−1, −2.0% yr−1, p < 0.05), and the Pacific Ocean (−0.022 ng m−3 yr−1, −1.7% yr−1, p < 0.05). Decreasing GEM trend (−0.020 ng m−3 yr−1, −1.5% yr−1), but insignificant (p > 0.05), was also found for air masses coming from South China Sea. The decreasing trends observed with air from the Pacific Ocean and South China Sea indicated declining background GEM concentrations in Northern Hemisphere. Decrease in GEM concentrations at the LABS was in agreement with the reduction in atmospheric Hg export from the East Asia continent caused by changes in Hg emission quantity and speciation, and temporal and spatial distribution in emission sources that have been suggested by recent research. Additionally, changes in the frequency distribution of air mass origins and transport paths may also contribute to the changes in GEM concentrations at LABS.","Mountain,Atmospheric mercury,East Asia,Trend,Export,"
"maritime search and rescue based on group mobile computing for unmanned aerial vehicles and unmanned surface vehicles","2020","Accidents often occur at sea, so effective maritime search and rescue is essential. In the current process of sea search and rescue, the operation efficiency of large search and rescue equipment is low and it cannot provide stable communication link. In this article, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) are used to form a cognitive mobile computing network for co-operative search and rescue, and reinforcement learning (RL) is used to plan search path and improve communication throughput. Based on the scene of marine search and rescue, the grid method is used to model the search and rescue area. Meanwhile, an intragroup communication architecture based on UAVs and USVs is designed to assist intragroup communication by recognizing the link channel state between UAVs. Search and rescue path planning is carried out through the strategy iteration of Markov decision process (MDP). Furthermore, distributed RL is used to recognize the channel state and perform mobile computing, so as to optimize the data throughput in the communication group.

"conflict detection method based on dynamic ship domain model for visualization of collision risk hot-spots","2021","Ship collisions have occurred frequently in the past few decades due to the significant increase in traffic volume. In view of their severe consequences, it is of practical significance to identify the ship encounter scenarios with collision potentials for the waters with high traffic density. In this paper, a systematic methodology is proposed to detect possible collision scenarios and identify the distributions of collision risk Hot-Spots in a given area. A dynamic ship domain model that considers the preferences of navigators with respect to the distance passing with other ships before and after the collision avoidance action is first built as the basis of conflict detection modelling. Then a ship domain-based conflict severity model is established to evaluate the risk levels of ships being involved in dangerous encounters. The spatial-temporal pattern mining methods are subsequently extended to identify collision risk Hot-Spots and analyze the collision risk cluster features with time of day. A case study is finally performed using the real AIS data in Ningbo-Zhoushan Port area. Results indicate that combining spatial-temporal pattern mining with collision candidate detection is a useful means to identify where the Hot-Spots are and how the risk is distributed in terms of space and time.","Ship domain,Maritime safety,Traffic conflict,Collision risk visualization,AIS data,"
"a neural network-based approach for the detection of heavy precipitation using gnss observations and surface meteorological data","2021","Recent years have witnessed a growing interest in using GNSS observations to detect heavy precipitation. In this study, a neural network-based (NN-based) approach taking seven meteorological variables as input data was developed based on the back propagation (BP) algorithm for detecting heavy precipitation. Apart from the surface meteorological variables of temperature, pressure and relative humidity, the model has also adopted other information such as day-of-year, hour-of-day and GNSS-derived zenith total delay and precipitable water vapor (PWV) as input variables. The feasibility of using these variables for developing the BP-NN-based model was elaborated by conducting the feature analysis of the seven input variables. In addition, the criterion for selecting a proper size of training sample was also briefly investigated by studying the impact and sensibility of the sample lengths in the model. The proposed model was developed using a sample size of an 8-year (2010–2017) period in the summer at a pair of co-located GNSS/weather stations−HKSC-KP in Hong Kong. The use of a long-term data is to “reliably” capture the characteristics of the selected variables. The detection results for the summer months in 2018 and 2019 were then compared against corresponding precipitation records to valid the effectiveness of the newly proposed model. Results of the correct detection and false alarm rates were 94.5 % and 20.8 %, respectively, which were significant improvements compared with the existing models.","Neural network,Zenith total delay (ZTD),Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS),Precipitable water vapor (PWV),Heavy precipitation detection,"
"the changing role of fire in conifer-dominated temperate rainforest through the last 14,000 years","2018","Climate, fire and vegetation dynamics are often tightly coupled through time. Here, we use a 14 kyr sedimentary charcoal and pollen record from Lake Osborne, Tasmania, Australia, to explore how this relationship changes under varying climatic regimes within a temperate rainforest ecosystem. Superposed epoch analysis reveals a significant relationship between fire and vegetation change throughout the Holocene at our site. Our data indicates an initial resilience of the rainforest system to fire under a stable cool and humid climate regime between ca. 12–6 ka. In contrast, fires that occurred after 6 ka, under an increasingly variable climate regime wrought by the onset of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), resulted in a series of changes within the local rainforest vegetation that culminated in the replacement of rainforest by fire-promoted Eucalypt forest. We suggest that an increasingly variable ENSO-influenced climate regime inhibited rainforest recovery from fire because of slower growth, reduced fecundity and increased fire frequency, thus contributing to the eventual collapse of the rainforest system.","Rainforest,Pollen,El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO),Superposed epoch analysis (SEA),Tasmania,Charcoal,"
"satellite radar altimetry water elevations performance over a 200m wide river: evaluation over the garonne river","2017","For at least 20 years, nadir altimetry satellite missions have been successfully used to first monitor the surface elevation of oceans and, shortly after, of large rivers and lakes. For the last 5–10 years, few studies have demonstrated the possibility to also observe smaller water bodies than previously thought feasible (river smaller than 500m wide and lake below 10km2). The present study aims at quantifying the nadir altimetry performance over a medium river (200m or lower wide) with a pluvio-nival regime in a temperate climate (the Garonne River, France). Three altimetry missions have been considered: ENVISAT (from 2002 to 2010), Jason-2 (from 2008 to 2014) and SARAL (from 2013 to 2014). Compared to nearby in situ gages, ENVISAT and Jason-2 observations over the lower Garonne River mainstream (110 km upstream of the estuary) have the smallest errors, with water elevation anomalies root mean square errors (RMSE) around 50cm and 20cm, respectively. The few ENVISAT upstream measurements have RMSE ranging from 80cm to 160cm. Over the estuary, ENVISAT and SARAL water elevation anomalies RMSE are around 30cm and 10cm, respectively. The most recent altimetry mission, SARAL, does not provide river elevation measurements for most satellite overflights of the river mainstream. The altimeter remains “locked” on the top of surrounding hilly areas and does not observe the steep-sided river valley, which could be 50–100m lower. This phenomenon is also observed, for fewer dates, on Jason-2 and ENVISAT measurements. In these cases, the measurement is not “erroneous”, it just does not correspond to water elevation of the river that is covered by the satellite. ENVISAT is less prone to get ‘locked’ on the top of the topography due to some differences in the instrument measurement parameters, trading lower accuracy for more useful measurements. Such problems are specific to continental surfaces (or near the coasts), but are not observed over the open oceans, which are flatter. To overcome this issue, an experimental instrument operating mode, called the DIODE/DEM tracking mode, has been developed by CNES (Centre National d’Etudes Spatiales) and has been tested during few Jason-2 cycles and during the first SARAL/AltiKA cycle. This tracking mode “forces” the instrument to observe a target of interest, i.e. water bodies. The example of the Garonne River shows, for one SARAL ground track, the benefit of the DIODE/DEM tracking mode for a steep-sided river reach, which is not detected using the nominal instrument operating mode. Yet, this mode relies on ancillary datasets (a priori global DEM and global land/water mask), which are critical to obtain river valley observation. The ultimately computed elevations along the satellite tracks, loaded on board, should have an absolute vertical accuracy around 10m (or better). This case also shows, when the instrument is correctly observing the river valley, that the altimeter can detect water bodies narrower than 100m (like an artificial canal). In agreement with recent studies, this work shows that altimeter missions can provide useful water elevation measurements over a 200m wide river with RMSE as low as 50cm and 20cm, for ENVISAT and Jason-2 respectively. The seasonal cycle can be observed with the temporal sampling of these missions (35 days and 10 days, respectively), but short term events, like flood events, are most of the time not observed. It also illustrates that altimeter capability to observe a river is highly dependent of the surrounding topography, the observation configuration, previous measurements and the instrument design. Therefore, it is not possible to generalize at global scale the minimum river width that could be seen by altimeters. This study analyzes, for the first time, the potential of the experimental DIODE/DEM tracking mode to observe steep-sided narrow river valleys, which are frequently missed with nominal tracking mode. For such case, using the DIODE/DEM mode could provide water elevation measurements, as long as the on board DEM is accurate enough. This mode should provide many more valid measurements over steep-sided rivers than currently observed.","SARAL,Garonne River,DIODE/DEM mode,Satellite altimetry,ENVISAT,Jason-2,"
"image-consistent detection of road anomalies as unpredictable patches","2023","We propose a novel method for anomaly detection primarily aiming at autonomous driving. The design of the method, called DaCUP (Detection of anomalies as Consistent Unpredictable Patches), is based on two general properties of anomalous objects: an anomaly is (i) not from a class that could be modelled and (ii) it is not similar (in appearance) to non-anomalous objects in the image. To this end, we propose a novel embedding bottleneck in an auto-encoder like architecture that enables modelling of a diverse, multi-modal known class appearance (e.g. road). Secondly, we introduce novel image-conditioned distance features that allow known class identification in a nearest-neighbour manner on-the-fly, greatly increasing its ability to distinguish true and false positives. Lastly, an inpainting module is utilized to model the uniqueness of detected anomalies and significantly reduce false positives by filtering regions that are similar, thus reconstructable from their neighbourhood. We demonstrate that filtering of regions based on their similarity to neighbour regions, using e.g. an inpainting module, is general and can be used with other methods for reduction of false positives. The proposed method is evaluated on several publicly available datasets for road anomaly detection and on a maritime benchmark for obstacle avoidance. The method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both tasks with the same hyper-parameters with no domain specific design.","Benchmark testing,anomalous objects,road anomaly detection,Feature extraction,detection of anomalies as consistent unpredictable patches,Design methodology,Filtering,nearest-neighbour manner,nonanomalous objects,object detection,feature extraction,multimodal known class appearance,inpainting module,autonomous driving,domain specific design,nearest neighbour methods,Roads,image-consistent detection,mobile robots,image restoration,DaCUP,Task analysis,auto-encoder,Algorithms: Image recognition and understanding (object detection,obstacle avoidance,Computer vision,road vehicles,categorization,image-conditioned distance features,class identification,segmentation),"
"upper air thermal inversion and their impact on the summer monsoon rainfall over goa – a case study","2018","Profiles of periodic GPS Radiosonde ascends collected from a station at the west coast of India (Goa) during summer monsoon months (June to September) of 2009 and 2013 have been used to analyze the thermal inversion statistics at various heights and their repercussions on the regional weather is studied. The interaction of contrasting air masses over the northern Arabian Sea often produces a two layer structure in the lower 5000 m close to the coastal station with warm and dusty air (Summer Shamal) occupying the space above the cool and moist Low Level Jet (LLJ) by virtue of their density differences. The warm air intrusion creates low lapse rate pockets above LLJ and modifies the gravitational stability strong enough to inhibit convection. It is observed that the inversion occurring in the lower 3000 m layer with an optimum layer thickness of 100–200 m has profound influence on the weather beneath it. We demonstrated the validity of the proposed hypothesis by analyzing the collocated data from radiosonde, lidar and the rain gauge during 16th July 2013 as a case study. The lidar depolarization ratio provides evidence to support the two layer structure in the lidar backscatter image. The presence of dust noticed in the two layer interface hints the intrusion of warm air that makes the atmosphere stable enough to suppress convection. The daily rainfall record of 2013 surprisingly coincides with the patterns of a regional break like situation centered at 16th July 2013 in Goa.","Low Level Jet,Two layer structure,Warm air intrusion,Thermal inversion,Monsoon,"
"multimodal sensor fusion for robust obstacle detection and classification in the maritime robotx challenge","2019","This paper describes a novel probabilistic sensor fusion framework aimed at improving obstacle detection accuracy and classification of various targets experienced in the Maritime RobotX Challenge. In both the 2014 and 2016 Maritime RobotX Challenges, it was found that detecting obstacles using LIDAR only and classifying obstacles using vision only can be challenged by environmental conditions, such as glare from the sun or by objects such as the spherical black buoys from the obstacle field that disperses LIDAR rays. In this paper, a new multimodal sensor fusion approach is proposed that combines data streams from perception sensors, such as LIDAR, RADAR, and cameras, to improve the robustness of detection and classification performance over a single sensor method. Using data collected from both the 2014 and 2016 Maritime RobotX Challenges, an evaluation of the perception framework is provided. The proposed detection and classification framework is now being transferred to the Queensland University of Technology (QUT) autonomous surface vehicle to improve overall mapping accuracy and task execution.","sensor fusion,multimodal sensor fusion approach,detecting obstacles,probabilistic sensor fusion framework,robot vision,Cameras,task execution,perception sensors,Laser radar,robot sensing systems,Robot sensing systems,single sensor method,autonomous surface vehicle,computer vision,object detection,obstacle detection accuracy,data streams,robot learning,Multimodal sensors,optical radar,obstacle field,robust obstacle detection,probability,mobile robots,LIDAR,Task analysis,marine vehicles,collision avoidance,maritime robotx challenge,Autonomous systems,"
"sensor information fusion architecture for virtual maritime environment","2012","This paper presents a ongoing research on generic sensor fusion architecture and its application to a maritime surveillance system. The importance of information fusion for various sensor types and specialized sensor fusion systems in various domains are discussed. In sensor fusion, centralized versus decentralized refers to where the fusion of the data occurs. In centralized fusion, the clients simply forward all of the data to a central location, and some entity at the central location is responsible for correlating and fusing the data. In this research we intend to correlate multiple maritime sensors such as RADAR, AIS, and other electronic object detection systems. Sri Lanka Navy has myriad of surveillance information sources such as AIS (Automatic Identification System), RADAR (Radio Aid Detection and Ranging), SONAR (Sound Navigation and Ranging), MSTT, HFSWR, AVL (Automatic Vessel Locating), HF Communication, Intelligence Data ect. So it is obvious that an information fusion methodology is needed to harness the effectiveness of multiple sensor information. An object identification pipeline is conceptualized such that an unknown object in the maritime domain is detected reducing the uncertainty of obtained information. The radical new virtual reality application has been developed to visualize the information fused from sensors and discussed in depth in addition to the introduction of the fusion process. The technologies used in developing the virtual world and incorporating the real time information in to the virtual world is presented in simplified modal for the purpose of clarity. Also design aspects and some experimental analysis developed in an applied project at the Sri Lanka Navy intended to demonstrate fusion technologies in this environment through an operative prototype are presented.","object identification pipeline,sensor fusion,virtual reality,virtual reality application,maritime sensor,operative prototype,Solid modeling,data visualisation,Mobile communication,sensor information fusion architecture,centralized data fusion,object detection,Networked information processing,Radar tracking,fused information visualization,virtual maritime surveillance system,Computational modeling,central location,Tactical display,video surveillance,virtual world,Information fusion,oceanographic techniques,"
"reducing cyclic prefix overhead based on symbol repetition in nb-iot-based maritime communication","2022","With the increasing maritime activities, a great demand of wide-area maritime digital data services is needed. Therefore, Narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT) that can provide wide coverage has been expected as an application for maritime communication networks (MCNS). In this paper, we aim to enhance the spectral efficiency in NB-IoT by reducing the cyclic prefix (CP) overhead in random access signal without causing interference. The key point of the proposed scheme is the symbols transmitted for multiple times repeatedly in NB-IoT. Specifically, all CP are removed and multi-path fading effect is eliminated by using a repeated symbol to cover the disturbed symbol to construct a circular convolution structure of the channel with the same effect as adding CP. In addition, a single-tap equalization is still appropriate. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, simulation results are carried out with respect to the bit error ratio (BER).","narrowband physical random access channel,bit error ratio,Internet of Things,Time-domain analysis,wide area maritime digital data services,interference,multipath fading effect,symbol repetition,circular convolution structure,cyclic prefix,single tap equalization,error statistics,spectral efficiency,OFDM,multipath channels,disturbed symbol,Discrete Fourier transforms,radiofrequency interference,repeated symbol,NB-IoT-based maritime communication,NB-IoT,Narrowband,Symbols,equalisers,marine communication,Signal to noise ratio,maritime communication networks,cyclic prefix overhead,Spectral efficiency,maritime activities,fading channels,"

"building resilience through foresight: the case of maritime container shipping firms","2022","Maritime container shipping (MCS) firms represent the backbone of worldwide supply chains. Due to the emergence of global trends and disruptions, MCS firms increasingly face an uncertain environment. Consequently, MCS firms must develop dynamic capabilities to enable the reconfiguration of organizational resources for building resilience in a constantly changing business ecosystem. To create adequate dynamic capabilities, MCS firms need to anticipate the future of their macro environment through advanced foresight techniques. Using a Delphi-based scenario analysis, this study systematically examines scenarios for MCS firmsâ€™ macro environment. Twelve projections for the MCS industry were systematically created and were then assessed by 51 maritime experts. The resulting three distinct scenarios deliver valuable insights for MCS firmsâ€™ executives, whereas the blockchains and drones technology will have already increased efficiency in the short-term scenario â€œpicking the low-hanging fruit,â€ other technological disruptions will only affect the industry in the medium-term scenario â€œexperiencing an era of dichotomy.â€ In the long-term scenario â€œovercoming the obstacles of the generational shift,â€ MCS firms will experience a transfer toward alternative fuel powered and autonomously driven vessels. Offering detailed scenarios for the future MCS macro environment, this study represents a guide for decision-makers on how to create dynamic capabilities in MCS firms to build resilience. Moreover, the results revealed differences in the expertsâ€™ assessments due to their characteristics. Therefore, the study contributes to the academic focus on in-depth diversity analysis in the Delphi methodology and emphasizes the relevance of incorporating multiple stakeholders and panelists in future planning.","Pandemics,freight transportation,maritime,Uncertainty,scenarios,technology foresight,Delphi,Containers,COVID-19,judgmental forecasting,Bibliographies,Industries,Planning,Supply chains,"
"majorities help minorities: hierarchical structure guided transfer learning for few-shot fault recognition","2022","To ensure the operational safety and reliability, fault recognition of complex systems is becoming an essential process in industrial systems. However, the existing recognition methods mainly focus on common faults with enough data, which ignore that many faults are lack of samples in engineering practice. Transfer learning can be helpful, but irrelevant knowledge transfer can cause performance degradation, especially in complex systems. To address the above problem, a hierarchy guided transfer learning framework (HGTL) is proposed in this paper for fault recognition with few-shot samples. Firstly, we fuse domain knowledge, label semantics and inter-class distance to calculate the affinity between categories, based on which a category hierarchical tree is constructed by hierarchical clustering. Then, guided by the hierarchical structure, the samples in most similar majority classes are selected from the source domain to pre-train the hierarchical feature learning network (HFN) and extract the transferable fault information. For the fault knowledge extracted from the child nodes of one parent node are similar and can be transferred with each other, so the trained HFN can extract better features of few samples classes with the help of the information from similar faults, and used to address few-shot fault recognition problems. Finally, a dataset of a nuclear power system with 65 categories and the widely used Tennessee Eastman dataset are analyzed respectively via the proposed method, as well as state-of-the-art recognition methods for comparison. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method in fault recognition with few-shot problem.","Complex systems,Few-shot problem,Transfer learning,Fault recognition,Hierarchical category structure,"
"assessment of ozone variations and meteorological effects in an urban area in the mediterranean coast","2002","Ozone concentrations are valuable indicators of possible health and environmental impacts. However, they are also used to monitor changes and trends in the sources of both ozone and its precursors. For this purpose, the influence of meteorological variables is a confusing factor. This study presents an analysis of a year of ozone concentrations measured in a coastal Spanish city. Firstly, the aim of this study was to perceive the daily, monthly and seasonal variation patterns of ozone concentrations. Diurnal cycles are presented by season and the fit of the data to a normal distribution is tested. In order to assess ozone behaviour under temperate weather conditions, local meteorological variables (wind direction and speed, temperature, relative humidity, pressure and rainfall) were monitored together with ozone concentrations. The main relationships we could observe in these analyses were then used to obtain a regression equation linking diurnal ozone concentrations in summer with meteorological parameters.","Coastal Mediterranean site,Meteorological parameters,Urban ozone,"
"silicon impacts on soil microflora under ralstonia solanacearum inoculation","2020","Silicon (Si) can increase plant resistance against bacterial wilt caused by Ralstonia solanacearum and enhance plant immune response. However, whether Si alleviates soil-borne disease stress through altering soil microbial community component and diversity is not clear. In this study, effects of Si application under R. solanacearum inoculation with or without plant on soil bacterial and fungal communities were investigated through high-throughput pyrosequencing technique. The results showed that Si addition significantly reduced bacterial wilt incidence. However, Si did not reduce the amount of R. solanacearum in rhizosphere soil. Principal components analysis showed that soil microbial community composition was strongly influenced by Si addition. Total 63.7% bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and 43.8% fungal OTUs were regulated by Si addition regardless of the presence of tomato plants, indicating the independent effects of Si on soil microbial community. Si-added soil harbored a lower abundance of Fusarium, Pseudomonas, and Faecalibacterium. Our finding further demonstrated that exogenous Si could significantly influence soil microbial community component, and this may provide additional insight into the mechanism of Si-enhanced plant resistance against soil-borne pathogens.","bacterial wilt,silicon,soil microbial community,deep pyrosequencing,"

"meteorological regimes modulating dust outbreaks in southwest asia: the role of pressure anomaly and inter-tropical convergence zone on the 1–3 july 2014 case","2015","The present work examines the characteristics (source regions, pathways, vertical profiles) as well as the meteorological conditions and the role of the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) during a dust event on 1–3 July 2014 over southwest (SW) Asia. NCEP/NCAR reanalysis, meteorological and satellite remote sensing (MODIS, Meteosat, CALIPSO) observations are utilized. The major dust storm (AOD550 up to 1.5–2.0) was generated in the southern Karakum desert in Turkmenistan as a result of intense north winds (Levar), due to enhanced pressure gradient between the Caspian Sea and Hindu Kush Mountains. The dust storm was vertically extended up to 5km over the arid terrain of SW Asia, as a consequence of the deep mixing layer and increased convection, while over northern Arabian Sea it was mixed with another dust plume coming from Arabia and marine aerosols due to strong monsoon winds within the boundary layer. The regional topography, variations in pressure, monsoon circulation and the position of the ITCZ play a decisive role on modulation of the wind field, dust-storm pathways and vertical distribution of dust. Enhanced knowledge of atmospheric circulation and processes responsible for dust export over SW Asia and Arabian Sea in linkage to the Levar wind and Indian summer monsoon is essential for improving dust forecasts and simulations over the region.","MSLP anomalies,SW Asia,ITCZ position,Dust storm,Karakum desert,Vertical dust distribution,"
"deployment strategies of mobile networks for internet-of-things in smart maritime ports","2022","It is estimated that 80% of world trade is transported via maritime logistic. The maritime trade networks can be seen as a graph with links and nodes. For an optimal network, the links representing the maritime routes must be short (with minimal cost) and secure. The nodes of the network represents the maritime ports, which are hub sending, receiving or switching the goods (in form of containers). The ports has passed from analog to digital ports to make use of IT tools to speed up the process, especially the administrative part. Nowadays, we talk about smart ports that uses data to further speed up the process administratively but also use a full automation to accelerate/optimize the processing of the goods/containers in terminals/quay. Terminal Operation System (TOS) is the main components in these operations. Therefore, the use of Internet-of-Thing (IoT) in TOS a decisive step towards smart ports.

"a prototype gui for unmanned air vehicle mission planning and execution","2014","This paper describes the development of a graphical user interface which provides unique mission control services to unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) operators. The software has two modes of operation, Planning Mode and Execution Mode. In Planning Mode an operator can readily simulate a desired flight plan to determine mission feasibility. Key features of this mode include integration of forecast weather data and interactive trajectory planning. Harsh North Atlantic weather can jeopardize a mission, so running a simulation with predicted wind conditions may greatly reduce the risk of a UAV loss. In Execution Mode the operator can deploy an autonomous vehicle, change the route “on the fly”, hold the aircraft over a point of interest, and return the UAV to home base whenever necessary. In both modes the predicted and actual weather conditions are the key to mission success. All weather data required for these functions is automatically downloaded via the internet. Operation of the software, including interactive trajectory planning, weather observation, mission planning and execution, is achieved through a user-friendly graphical user interface. Simulation results, flight trajectories, and weather data can be saved for further analysis. Comparing missions with and without weather information, it was determined that meteorological information can have a very significant impact on the mission success or failure. In a typical example mission discussed here, including forecast weather conditions increased the UAV's fuel consumption by 18% and mission time by 26%.","airborne surveillance,autonomous vehicles,maritime security,UAV mission planning,graphical user interface,UAV mission control,Unmanned aerial vehicle control,"

"local glaciers record delayed peak holocene warmth in south greenland","2020","Local glaciers and ice caps (GICs) respond sensitively and quickly, on the scale of decades to centuries, to climate variations. Continuous records of past fluctuations in GIC size provide information on the timing and magnitude of Holocene climate shifts, and a longer-term perspective on 21st century glacier retreat. Although there is broad-scale agreement on millennial-scale trends in Holocene climate variability and fluctuations in local GICs in Greenland, regional variations are only loosely constrained. Here we present three Holocene proglacial lake sediment records from South Greenland, an area with abundant local glaciers but few Holocene-length paleoclimate records. In addition, we use geospatial analysis to model past equilibrium-line altitudes (ELAs) and thereby constrain the magnitude of ablation-season temperature change during the warmest and coolest periods of the Holocene. Physical and geochemical sedimentary characteristics show that two of the proglacial lakes continued to receive glacial meltwater input until ∼7.3 and ∼7.1 ka BP. The survival of local glaciers implies that South Greenland remained relatively cool, and that summer temperatures gradually warmed, but did not warm well beyond 1.2 °C above present in the early Holocene. In the mid-Holocene, from ∼7.1 to 5.5 ka BP, organic sedimentation at these two sites indicates that local glaciers became very small, or more likely melted away completely. The glaciers within the third lake’s catchment melted away prior to ∼5.2 ka BP, as sediments deposited earlier in the Holocene could not be dated at this site. We estimate that summer temperatures increased by at least 1.2–1.8 °C above present by ∼7.3–7.1 ka BP. Our results are consistent with other observations that suggest a north-to-south gradient in the timing of Holocene thermal maximum conditions, with southern Greenland experiencing a delayed warming relative to other regions in Greenland. As summer temperatures cooled in the Neoglacial, our records show that sustained glacier regrowth began ∼3.1 ka BP with glaciers in the southernmost catchment, which at present, receive the most precipitation. In the other two catchments, which host smaller glaciers in a drier environment, regrowth began at ∼1.3 and ∼1.2 ka BP, the timing of which is in agreement with other glacial records from the Arctic Atlantic region. Local glaciers reached their maximum late Holocene extents during a cooler, second phase of the Little Ice Age (LIA) ∼0.2-0.1 ka BP, that we estimate was at least 0.4–0.9 °C cooler than present. Overall, these findings improve understanding of the spatio-temporal dynamics of Holocene glacier and climate change in Greenland, potentially yielding valuable information about their future response.","Holocene thermal maximum,Mountain glaciers,Lake sediments,Equilibrium-line altitudes,Greenland,Paleotemperatures,Little ice age,"
"evolution, dynamics and optimization of maritime transportation in changshan islands","2010","Although till now, there isn't a consistent definition of island, many features like small size, insularity, remoteness and marginality, and proneness to natural disasters are shared by different islands in different region. These factors or special disadvantages lead to the characterization of small islands as being fragile due to their vulnerable ecology and economic systems (Belleretal., 1990; Briguglio, 1995). Maritime transportation is a primary way to build the link between islands and outer regions. Transport services can conquer the islands' disadvantages and provide the lifeline to the islands at edge. Maritime transportation is also an important means of breaking through islands' insulation in nature and extroversion in economy. Thus, it is important for islands areas to pay more attention to transportation issues at sea. Taking the Chang Shan islands in northern China as study object, setting out from checking space-time changes in traffic nodes (ports and docks), traffic lines on sea and passenger number, this paper analyzes the driving factors of maritime transportation changes, as well as problems nowadays. For optimizing the distribution of maritime transportation in Changshan islands and fostering integrated development of island-mainland economy, this paper deems that innovating ports investment policy, building shipping group, building land-coast base for islands and carrying out multi-modal transport between sea and land are effective measures nowadays.","Radio access networks,optimisation,transport services,Economics,Transportation,optimization,Cities and towns,shipping group,land-coast base,transportation,Marine vehicles,Changshan islands,maritime transportation,Investments,islands insulation,ports investment policy,Buildings,"

"two-stage offloading optimization for energyâ€“latency tradeoff with mobile edge computing in maritime internet of things","2020","The ever-increasing growth in maritime activities with large amounts of Maritime Internet-of-Things (M-IoT) devices and the exploration of ocean network leads to a great challenge for dealing with a massive amount of maritime data in a cost-effective and energy-efficient way. However, the resources-constrained maritime users cannot meet the high requirements of transmission delay and energy consumption, due to the excessive traffic and limited resources in maritime networks. To solve this problem, mobile edge computing is taken as a promising paradigm to help mobile devices from edge servers via computation offloading considering the different quality of service (QoS) with the complex ocean environments, resulting in energy saving and increased transmission latency. To investigate the tradeoff between latency and energy consumption in low-cost large-scale maritime communication, we formulate the offloading optimization problem and propose a two-stage joint optimal offloading algorithm, optimizing computation and communication resource allocation under limited energy and sensitive latency. At the first stage, the maritime users make the decision on whether to offload a computation considering their demands and environments. Then, the channel allocation and power allocation problems were proposed to optimize the offloading policy which coordinates with the center cloud servers at the second stage, considering the dynamic tradeoff of latency and energy consumption. Finally, numerical simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.","offloading strategies,telecommunication power management,channel allocation,computation offloading,maritime data,limited resources,ocean network,dynamic tradeoff,two-stage joint optimal offloading algorithm,energy-efficiency,resources-constrained maritime users,QoS,Internet of Things,quality of service,Marine vehicles,Maritime Internet-of-Things,Resource management,large-scale maritime communication,mobile edge computing (MEC),two-stage offloading optimization,Servers,Energy???latency tradeoff,cloud computing,maritime networks,Oceans,optimisation,communication resource allocation,mobile computing,mobile edge computing,energy-latency tradeoff,offloading policy,maritime Internet of Things (M-IoT),network traffic,energy saving,transmission delay,telecommunication traffic,complex ocean environments,energy consumption,mobile devices,Cloud computing,marine communication,power allocation problems,cloud server,offloading optimization problem,Task analysis,maritime activities,resource allocation,edge servers,M-IoT devices,"
"edge-centric secure service provisioning in iot-enabled maritime transportation systems","2023","With the exponential growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) devices in Maritime Transportation Systems (MTS), the centralized cloud-centric framework can hardly meet the requirements of the applications in terms of low latency and power consumption.

However, one of the critical challenges of the edge-centric MTS is to provide security and privacy between local IoT devices and distributed edge nodes. Motivated by that, in this paper, we design a blockchain-enabled edge-centric framework for analyzing the real-time data at the edge of the networks with minimum latency and power consumption while meeting the security and privacy issue of MTS. The introduction of blockchain and smart contract in the edge-centric MTS frameworks help to validate the transactions of each block at edge nodes by estimating the lifetime, belief, and trustfulness, and mitigate various types of security threats. Further, we introduce different classification models to predict the malicious vessels over the real-time maritime dataset at a secured edge-centric MTS framework.

This paper aims to create a system that use AIS data to offer an improved understanding and additional insights on maritime transport. Using this naval system traffic is better understood, and with time its efficiency would be improved. The proposed system presents ship's details, destinations and locations data based on AIS data. We can use this system to create further functionalities for better and detailed analysis on maritime transport.","human-caused carbon emissions,transportation,Marine vehicles,maritime navigation datasets,goods distribution,Carbon dioxide,Meteorology,naval system traffic,ships,automatic identification system,maritime transport,insert,economics,global economy,Artificial intelligence,styling,Satellite broadcasting,formatting,air pollution,Navigation,component,ships monitoring,style,Fuels,"
"voyage-based computation offloading for secure maritime edge networks","2020","To implement efficient computation offloading for secure maritime edge networks, a voyage-based computation offloading mechanism is proposed for compute-intensive applications at sea. The edge nodes for computation offloading and the base stations for maritime communication are deployed on vessels to dynamically provide mobile edge computing services for nearby users. On the large time scale, a Hopcroft-Karp based offloading algorithm is proposed to pre-calculate the best computation offloading scheme for multi-users with the voyage information. On the small time scale, whether to perform the pre-calculated offloading or the local computing can be determined by the real-time demand for computing resources of each user. Simulation results with real ship data show that the proposed voyage-based offloading method can effectively improve the delay, energy consumption, and traffic cost of the offloading tasks in maritime edge networks.","Voyage-based computation offloading,offloading tasks,Mobile edge computing (MEC),Energy consumption,Marine vehicles,Delays,base stations,voyage-based offloading method,voyage information,time scale,cloud computing,voyage-based computation offloading mechanism,mobile edge computing services,mobile computing,secure maritime edge networks,Maritime edge networks,pre-calculated offloading,maritime communication,Real-time systems,Hopcroft-Karp based offloading algorithm,Edge computing,compute-intensive applications,computational complexity,Computational efficiency,computation offloading scheme,computing resources,Task analysis,local computing,"
"a fast sar image position algorithm for maritime target location","2016","In order to find the maritime targets location in SAR image accurately, a fast R-D algorithm is introduced in this paper and it can solve targets location problems which are in the sea area. The real latitude and longitude coordinates measure system and geographical coordinates are built up for SAR image, then the targets located in the sea can be point out. First, based on information in SAR satellite data headers the Doppler center frequency coefficients can be calculated. Then the parameters are carried in the R-D pattern for calculate four vertex coordinates of SAR image. Generally the solution of R-D pattern is an iterative process, here a fast algorithm is proposed which combined with slope distance, Doppler parameters and earth model to reduce variables, then and the position of SAR is calculated and the latitude and longitude coordinates of target is also obtained. Second, the SAR image geocoding can be made up and the target in SAR image over sea can be found out. Finally, compare these results with AIS data, the accuracy of location is analyzed. The result shows that the deviation of distance location is less than 200 meters, and the deviation of azimuth is less than 6'. The error is reasonable for real application. This algorithm is stability, fast and satisfies with target location in the sea.","R-D pattern solution,Satellites,hydrological techniques,latitude coordinates measure system,Mathematical model,Slant range Doppler parameters,Doppler center frequency coefficients,earth model,image coding,geographical coordinates,Synthetic aperture radar,geophysical image processing,SAR satellite data headers,vertex coordinates,variable reduction,Doppler parameters,synthetic aperture radar,Maritime targets,radar imaging,Doppler effect,geographic information systems,longitude coordinates measure system,slope distance,fast R-D algorithm,fast SAR image position algorithm,Image resolution,SAR image calibration,maritime target location,SAR image geocoding,R-D pattern,Earth,Imaging,"
"meteorological analysis of chemical exchange events in the arctic basin","1995","Analysis of chemical or aerosol exchange from the troposphere to the arctic surface is considerably more complex than similar analysis of Antarctic events. The complexity of chemical or aerosol exchange experiments in the Arctic requires considering occasional frontal exchange similar to that of the mid-latitudes, potential local contamination, and local sources of heat and moisture. These concerns are eliminated through site selection in most Antarctic exchange experiments. The inherent stability of near-surface layers in the arctic tropopause causes temporal anomalies when arrival times of aerosol or gaseous contaminants are compared with conservative meteorological tracers, further complicating the analysis. Three cases are presented. One illustrates the complexity in analyzing aerosol related to a warming event, the second describes the dimensions of a deep tropospheric mixing in the Arctic Basin, and the third examines the diurnal exchange of aerosol in the arctic summer. Some criteria relative to temporal resolution of aerosol and chemical measurements with respect to meteorological processes are proposed. Potential problems in distinguishing properties of aerosols transported from lower latitudes, in the presence of local aerosol sources, are discussed.","Arctic meteorology,Arctic chemical exchange,Arctic ozone exchange,Arctic aerosol exchange,Carbon dioxide-water vapour,Arctic basin,"
"redesigned waveforms in the maritime medium frequency bands","2020","Several studies have shown that the signals of marine radio beacons, which operate in the maritime medium frequency (MF) band, can be modified to enable range and position estimate. This technology called Ranging Mode (R-Mode) faces challenges in the resolution of ambiguities and suppression of multipath interference which are related to the small bandwidth of 500 to 1000 Hz per radio beacon. This paper shows that increasing the overall used bandwidth per station with the transmission in two separate MF channels or using the complete maritime MF band would increase the ability to estimate the ambiguities and identify signals reflected by the ionosphere. A matching pursuit algorithm is proposed to decompose the received signal into the ground-wave and sky-wave component.","R-Mode,marine radio beacons,R-mode,interference suppression,complete maritime MF band,maritime medium frequency band,ranging mode,multipath channels,received signal,radiofrequency interference,radio beacon,iterative methods,frequency 500.0 Hz to 1000.0 Hz,sky wave,GNSS backup,terrestrial navigation,marine communication,time-frequency analysis,multipath interference,position estimation,"
"lagrangian analysis of multi-satellite data in support of open ocean marine protected area design","2017","Compared to ecosystem conservation in territorial seas, protecting the open ocean has peculiar geopolitical, economic and scientific challenges. One of the major obstacle is defining the boundary of an open ocean Marine Protected Area (MPA). In contrast to coastal ecosystems, which are mostly constrained by topographic structures fixed in time, the life of marine organisms in the open ocean is entrained by fluid dynamical structures like eddies and fronts, whose lifetime occurs on ecologically-relevant timescales. The position of these highly dynamical structures can vary interannually by hundreds of km, and so too will regions identified as ecologically relevant such as the foraging areas of marine predators. Thus, the expected foraging locations suggested from tracking data cannot be directly extrapolated beyond the year in which the data were collected. Here we explore the potential of Lagrangian methods applied to multisatellite data as a support tool for a MPA proposal by focusing on the Crozet archipelago oceanic area (Indian Sector of the Southern Ocean). By combining remote sensing with biologging information from a key marine top predator (Eudyptes chrysolophus, or Macaroni penguin) of the Southern Ocean foodweb, we identify a highly dynamic branch of the Subantarctic front as a foraging hotspot. By tracking this feature in historical satellite data (1993–2012) we are able to extrapolate the position of this foraging ground beyond the years in which tracking data are available and study its spatial variability.",""
"long-term trend analysis of extreme climate in sarawak tropical peatland under the influence of climate change","2023","Extreme climate is one of the important variables which determine the capability of tropical peatland to act as either carbon sink and/or carbon source. The purpose of this study is to reveal the spatio-temporal trend in the long-term time series of extreme rainfall and temperature in Sarawak peatland cause by climate change. Gridded-based Princeton datasets were used for trend analysis spanning 68-year (1948–2016) based on Modified Mann-Kendall (m-MK) test which has the capability of distinguishing unidirectional trend with multi-scale variability. The m-MK test was also used to confirm the increasing or decreasing trend produce by Mann-Kendall (MK), and to discriminate the exaggeration in trend caused by serial auto-correlation due to the high effect of large scale climate events regulating the climate in the region. By using R-based program, RClimDex for extreme climate indices output, extreme climate under Northeast (NE) and Southwest (SW) monsoon showed lower grid point with significant changes under m-MK test compared to MK test at 95% significance level. Here, the exaggeration of trend by MK test has been reduced by using m-MK test which can accommodate the scaling effect in the time series due to inherent natural climate variability. Diurnal temperature range (DTR) was expected to decrease for both monsoons in the central-coastal region as minimum temperature (TN) increased more than maximum temperature (TX). Significant increase in extreme rainfall (R10, R20, Rnn) was spatially observed more during SW monsoon compared to NE monsoon, although with high spatial variability. Significant increase of TN indices of TNn and TN90p might cause increased rainfall intensity in the south and central-coastal region, while high TX indices of TXn might cause increased rainfall intensity in the north. Due to the imminent threat of climate change, this study gives scientists an essential view on the behavior of different extreme climate variables and its potential impact on the peatland area which is susceptible to flood and risk of fire during the NE and SW monsoon, respectively.","Climate extremes,Sarawak,Mann-Kendall test,Tropical peatland,Modified Mann-Kendall test,"

"combining delphi study and scenario planning for indonesia research priorities in maritime sector","2019","Trend Assessment and Scenario Development Analysis approach was carried out in this study. This approach is a framework specifically designed to look at the direction of technological development and possible conditions that occur in the future. First stage of the framework consists of the Delphi study, which is a method for obtaining issues related to maritime and possible conditions in the future. Second stage of the framework, scenario planning, which is a method to illustrate the possibility of future conditions by taking into account the main driving factors; then technology road-mapping illustrate the steps that must be taken to achieve the ideal conditions planned. The Delphi study is applied to develop a consensus-based, prioritized research agenda for Indonesia Foresight Maritime Research Topics in year 2018-2045. Expert investigation of the web-based Delphi method was employed to develop online survey. In this study, a three round modified Delphi survey was conducted. A total of 45 study participants were participated in the third round of study. Some interview study was designed to validate some of the findings. The top 10 priority themes were determined by the web-based Delphi method result and in-depth interview of experts. The results of this study indicate that among the Indonesian maritime researcher and maritime technology expert in this study, they have a high degree consensus on some research topics. In the second stage of the framework, we used â€œscenario planningâ€ approach. Scenario planning is intended to understand the perception of management in recognizing future alternatives so that appropriate decisions can be taken. Experts and stakeholders have better understanding of the issues pertaining the development of Maritime Frontier Research Topics in Indonesia, including those related to tourism, ocean and fisheries, infrastructures, energy and mineral etc. This study then analyzes the dynamics of strategic environment changes (socio-political-economic context) that determine the construction of Maritime Frontier Research Topics. By using a scenario planning analysis framework, the driving factors and uncertainty factors are formulated which are then developed into a strategic environmental scenario.

"modelling fire perimeter formation in the canadian rocky mountains","2022","Wildfires produce a mosaic of burned and unburned patches across varying temporal and spatial scales and provide a range of essential ecosystem services. Fire perimeters mark the separation between the burned and unburned matrix of a fire. Analysis of fire perimeters in the United States, Australia, and Alberta, have identified several key factors that influence the formation of a fire boundary, including fire environment variables, such as fuel, weather, and topographic conditions, as well as anthropogenic factors. We used matched case-control conditional logistic regression to assess the fire environment's influence on the formation of fire boundaries on the 2017 Verdant Creek Fire in the western Canadian Rocky Mountain region. Results indicated that fire boundary formation was strongly influenced by non-fuels, alpine and subalpine vegetation, wetland areas, and low and sparse shrub assemblages generally associated with avalanche paths. Fire cessation was more likely near waterways; however, the fire weather conditions that characterized most burning periods likely overrode other topographic influences. Fire cessation was most likely to occur one day following precipitation events when Vapour Pressure Deficit and Fire Weather Index values decreased. To explore the potential influence of spatial data resolution and fire mapping limitations on our results, we varied the distance between matched sample points selected on each side of the mapped fire perimeter during statistical modelling. Results demonstrated matched pairs of burned and unburned sample points were effective at representing discrete states when separated by at least 100 m and that insufficient or excessive separation between matched pairs confounds results, highlighting the importance of sensitivity analysis for determining the appropriate separation distance to represent burned and unburned states. We demonstrate a practical application of the model to predict spread potential, enabling rapid visual assessment of landscape locations most likely to limit fire spread.","Spatial analysis,Rocky Mountain forests,Wildland fire,Risk analysis,Fire extinguishment,Matched case-control conditional logistic regression,"
"factors affecting cyber risk in maritime","2019","To ensure the safety of ships and ports, groups and individuals, at all levels of the maritime sector, use analysis to identify potential hazards and their outcomes. One of the most relied upon methods is using a risk assessment tool to define and prioritise threats. A disadvantage of most existing assessment frameworks, however, is their inability to update risks dynamically as factors, such as the environment, change. In the maritime sector, a range of dynamic factors is needed to measure risks, but most conventional frameworks are unable to use them to revise and update their risk profiles. In addition to static and dynamic, maritime operational risks can be affected by elements classified as cyber, cyber-physical, or physical in nature. This demonstrates the relatively equal presence of information and operational technology (i.e. IT/OT) used, however most quantitative risk assessment frameworks are normally limited to one or the other. This article explores the full range of cyber-related risk factor types within maritime in order to evaluate applicable risk frameworks and suggest improvements that could help each of those tools assess maritime-cyber risks specifically.","maritime,risk frameworks,Risk management,cyber-physical,Safety,risk profiles,Marine vehicles,security of data,cyber risk,risk assessment tool,dynamic,maritime-cyber risks,History,cyber,marine engineering,Hardware,risk management,dynamic factors,risk,risk analysis,Software,dynamic risks,Training,maritime operational risks,hazards,static risks,quantitative risk assessment frameworks,cyber-related risk factor types,maritime sector,"

"water segmentation with superior guidance and aligned fusion strategy for unmanned surface vehicles in maritime environment","2022","As a mid-level vision task, water segmentation is essential for unmanned surface systems such as to get the sailing area and avoid the floating objects to ensure vehicles safety in maritime environment. However, existing deep learning method of water segmentation has a little weakness on maintaining origin-scale fineness. At the same time, our intuition is that ground truth is a powerful tool for optimizing the global network. In this paper, we give solutions through these two aspects using superior guidance and aligned fusion strategy. Aligned fusion provides symmetric and fine-grained fusion strategy when using encoder-decoder structured network, and superior guidance enforce the segmentation network grasp the discrimination criterion much earlier before output part of the network.

"an analysis of long-term trends, seasonality and short-term dynamics in water quality data from plynlimon, wales","2012","This paper examines two hydrochemical time-series derived from stream samples taken in the Upper Hafren catchment, Plynlimon, Wales. One time-series comprises data collected at 7-hour intervals over 22months (Neal et al., 2012-this issue), while the other is based on weekly sampling over 20years. A subset of determinands: aluminium, calcium, chloride, conductivity, dissolved organic carbon, iron, nitrate, pH, silicon and sulphate are examined within a framework of non-stationary time-series analysis to identify determinand trends, seasonality and short-term dynamics. The results demonstrate that both long-term and high-frequency monitoring provide valuable and unique insights into the hydrochemistry of a catchment. The long-term data allowed analysis of long-term trends, demonstrating continued increases in DOC concentrations accompanied by declining SO4 concentrations within the stream, and provided new insights into the changing amplitude and phase of the seasonality of the determinands such as DOC and Al. Additionally, these data proved invaluable for placing the short-term variability demonstrated within the high-frequency data within context. The 7-hour data highlighted complex diurnal cycles for NO3, Ca and Fe with cycles displaying changes in phase and amplitude on a seasonal basis. The high-frequency data also demonstrated the need to consider the impact that the time of sample collection can have on the summary statistics of the data and also that sampling during the hours of darkness provides additional hydrochemical information for determinands which exhibit pronounced diurnal variability. Moving forward, this research demonstrates the need for both long-term and high-frequency monitoring to facilitate a full and accurate understanding of catchment hydrochemical dynamics.","Diurnal cycles,High frequency monitoring,Carbon,Time-series analysis,Nitrogen,Plynlimon,"
"characterisation of a complex maritime scene using fourier space analysis to identify small craft","1999","This paper describes the continuing development of a system, which is able to extract, identify and track maritime vessels. The system first interprets changes in the frequency domain of the image to build a characteristic frequency template that describes the structure of the current sea state. No a priori knowledge of any characteristic frequencies is assumed. The system is given various points within the sea and based on these points builds an average characteristic frequency response, effectively a template of the current sea state. The template is used to remove most of the sea from consecutive image frames, which leaves regions in the image mainly containing maritime vessels. Frame differencing of the frequency processed images is used to generate regions of interest, from which a set of object descriptors are calculated. A tracking algorithm resolves the frame to frame correspondences using a set of motion constraints. Regions that satisfy the constraints are highlighted and tracked. Regions that fail to satisfy the motion constraints are removed and no longer processed.","characteristic frequency template,frequency processed images,tracking algorithm,Fourier space analysis,complex maritime scene,characteristic frequency response,object descriptors,small craft,frame to frame correspondences,sea state,regions of interest,frequency domain,frequency response,maritime vessels,frame differencing,motion constraints,"
"edge computing-enabled multi-sensor data fusion for intelligent surveillance in maritime transportation systems","2022","With the rapid development of navigation technologies, maritime transportation has become one of the mainstream international trade channels. However, a large number of maritime traffic accidents still occur every year, which cause significant economic losses and environmental damage. Intelligent and efficient surveillance in maritime transportation systems is essential for avoiding accidents. This paper proposes an edge computing-enabled multi-sensor data fusion method for intelligent maritime surveillance, which achieves efficient perception of maritime traffic information by receiving and processing visual and Automatic Identification System (AIS) data simultaneously. We first propose an anti-occlusion algorithm for vessel tracking based on visual trajectory analysis to mitigate missing detection caused by overlapping vessels. We then leverage the Hungarian algorithm driven by multidimensional feature analysis to match data collected by different sensors. The matched AIS information is eventually fused into the visual target of interest. Extensive experiments illustrate that our method can achieve effective information perception in different maritime environments with 91.67% accuracy and superior robustness.","Image edge detection,marine accidents,surveillance,intelligent maritime surveillance,anti-occlusion tracking,Transportation,Prediction algorithms,maritime transportation systems,data fusion,multi-sensor data fusion,Hungarian algorithm,Intelligent maritime surveillance,vessel trajectory prediction,vessel tracking,object tracking,ships,marine safety,marine engineering,Automatic Identification System,visual trajectory analysis,AIS,anti-occlusion algorithm,maritime environments,maritime traffic accidents,edge computing,multisensor data fusion,maritime traffic information,Data integration,Visualization,Navigation,Surveillance,distributed processing,"
"simulation of the order process in maritime hinterland transportation: the impact of order release times","2017","The integration of information systems between the various actors organizing and executing the transport of containers to seaports is slowly progressing. Transport orders are frequently characterized by high change rates causing high manual revision effort for dispatchers. Therefore, these order changes, often received shortly before the day of departure, raise the question regarding the immediate transmission of transport orders to the subsequent actors in the transport chain. This paper analyzes the impact of different order release times, which define the timing of order transmission, on order process efficiency (processing times and costs) using a multi-method simulation approach. In a case study, four actors, two focusing on transport planning and two on operative transport execution, are considered. The simulation experiments with varying order release times and change rates reveal: A late release of orders from planning to operative actors and a reduction of order changes can significantly increase order process efficiency.","freight handling,transport planning,order process,maritime hinterland transportation,transportation,transport chain,order processing,seaports,order transmission,"

"securing iot based maritime transportation system through entropy-based dual-stack machine learning framework","2023","Internet of Things (IoTs) is envisaged to widely capture the realm of logistics and transportation services in future. The applications of ubiquitous IoTs have been extended to Maritime Transportation Systems (MTS) that spawned increasing security threats; posing serious fiscal concerns to stakeholders involved. Among these threats, Distributed Denial of Service Attack (DDoS) is ranked very high that can wreak havoc on IoT artifacts of the MTS networks. Timely and effective detection of such attacks is imperative for necessary mitigation. Conventional approaches exploit entropy of attributes in network traffic for detecting DDoS attacks. However, the majority of these approaches are static in nature and consider only a few network traffic parameters, limiting the number of DDoS attack detection to a few types and intensities. In current research, a novel framework named â€œDual Stack Machine Learning (S2ML)â€ has been proposed to calculate distinct entropy-based varying 10-Tuple (T) features from network traffic features, three window sizes and associated Rate of Exponent Separation (RES). These features have been exploited for developing an intelligent model over MTS-IoT datasets to successfully detect multiple types of DDoS attacks in MTS. S2ML is an efficient framework that overcomes the shortcomings of prevalent DDoS detection approaches, as evident from the comparison with Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), Alternating Decision Tree (ADT) and Simple Logistic Regression (SLR) over different evaluation metrics (Confusion metrics, ROCs). The proposed S2ML technique outperforms prevalent ones with 1.5% better results compared to asserted approaches on distribution of normal/attack traffic.

"chapter 5 - time series analysis methods","2014","This chapter covers all aspects of time series analysis. In this latest edition, the material has been reorganized so that it now starts with basic concepts regarding stochastic processes and introduces correlation functions as the first step toward defining spectral analysis. We examine the application of spectral analysis to stochastic series and discrete series, and provide a thorough treatment of traditional spectral methods. The chi-squared property of spectral estimates is introduced and discussed as a means of evaluating the statistical significance of spectral estimates. Spectral methods for vector series are briefly discussed, as are rotary spectral estimation methods. The effects of temporal or spatial sampling on the resultant spectral estimates are explored and the resultant aliasing is introduced and discussed, as are the implications for frequency resolution. The smoothing of spectral estimates, or windowing, is described and the implications of window selection on the significance of spectral estimates are examined. Simple band averaging is discussed as a smoothing method and the resultant confidence intervals for the spectrum are introduced. The concepts of spectral fidelity and stability are discussed as outcomes of smoothing decisions. The needs for zero padding and prewhitening are then introduced. Next the spectral analysis of unevenly spaced series is a unique topic of this chapter. It also provides a summary of the standard spectral analysis approach. The discussion then shifts to parametric methods of spectral analysis starting with autoregressive power spectral estimation. The maximum entropy spectral method is then introduced along with maximum likelihood spectral estimation. Next is cross-spectral analysis, where we no longer have strict power spectra but must deal with coherence and phase. The Fourier transform method is introduced and the practical applications of this method are detailed. Phase and cross-amplitude functions are discussed along with co- and quadrature spectra. The unique aspects of confidence levels to cross-spectra are then introduced. The frequency response of a linear system is described, along with rotary cross-spectra. Wavelet analysis is subsequently introduced as an alternative to standard spectral methods. Various wavelet algorithms are examined relative to their advantages and disadvantages. Oceanographic examples are presented to show how wavelet analysis can be used. In addition to wavelets the S-transform is discussed along with the multiple filter technique developed by geophysicists. Basic Fourier spectral analysis is then introduced to take advantage of the popular Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) now possible with digital computing facilities. FFT applications to both discrete and continuous time/space series are discussed and detailed. A least-squares FFT method is introduced again as a way of handling gappy time/space series. Computational examples are included with all of these procedures. A discussion of the harmonic analysis as applied to tidal time series is then presented. In earlier editions of this text harmonic analysis was presented before the discussion of spectral methods but the authors now consider harmonic analysis as a subset of the larger spectral analysis and hence it comes later. Computational tidal examples are included here. Special time series methods such as “regime shift detection” (including “sequential t-test analysis of regime shifts,” “adaptive Kolmogorov–Zurbenko filters,” and “cumulative upwelling index”) are introduced and discussed. Vector regression is also suggested as a time series analysis method. Fractals are suggested as another technique to decompose a time series.","Regime shift detection,Spectral windows,Wavelet analysis,Cross-spectral analysis,Fourier analysis,Tidal analysis,Spectral filters,Aliasing,Spectral smoothing,Vector regression,FFT,Fractals,Co- and quadrature spectra,Band averaging,Least-squares spectral analysis,Spectral analysis,Harmonic analysis,"

The properties of the seismic measuring device and its graphical registrations on seismograms do not make a proper interpretation possible without detailed knowledge about the joint distribution of the primary dimensions of the boulders. Therefore, separate measurements were made of the dimensions of boulders deposited visibly on the cliff beaches of the Great Belt. The surprisingly simple results from the analysis of the data from this separate measuring program are reported in a companion paper. Based on the revealed geographical universality of the joint dimension distribution it is anticipated that the same distribution is applicable for the till deposits along the tunnel line. By use of this important distribution information and of the observed homogeneity of the seismic point source field together with the physical properties of diffraction it became possible to make the wanted prediction. During the excavation, the found boulders were counted and measured. These direct observations on site confirmed that the prediction was quite good.","Probabilistic models,Field investigations,Predictions,Statistical inference,Diffraction,Glacier till,Boulders,Tunnel boring,Seismic surveys,"
"quality of service provisions for maritime communications based on cellular networks","2017","Considering the increase of communication requirements from marine users, more studies try to introduce terrestrial wireless communication techniques into maritime communications to improve communication qualities. However, different communication scenarios introduce challenges for the application of terrestrial techniques to maritime networks. Furthermore, the communication coverage requirement is much larger than that of terrestrial networks, while the quality of service (QoS) requirement of marine users is expected to be like that on land, which makes network design more complicated. To address these problems, a user-centric communication architecture based on distributed antennas is proposed for maritime communications. The scenario of coastal networks based on cellular techniques is modeled mathematically, based on which the performance of such a network is analyzed and closed-form expressions of network performance are presented. To guarantee the QoS requirements of users, an antenna selection scheme is proposed, which can form a virtual service cloud for a targeted user. In addition, the precondition of the antenna selection scheme is discussed. Simulation results verify the analyses and indicate that the proposed scheme can guarantee the QoS of marine users under different cases.","fifth-generation (5G) cellular networks,Antennas,quality of service requirement,network design,coastal networks,distributed antenna (DA),quality of service,Marine vehicles,Sea measurements,antenna selection scheme,marine users,communication coverage requirement,QoS requirement,communication qualities,Quality of service,communication scenarios,closed-form expressions,maritime networks,cloud computing,cellular radio,antenna selection,Fading channels,Computer architecture,Cellular networks,network performance,mobile antennas,cellular networks,marine communication,cellular techniques,user-centric communication architecture,virtual service cloud,Quality of service (QoS) provisions,user-centric,maritime communications,"
"26 - applications of ai and possibilities for process control","2022","Multiphase flows occur in the oil and gas industries, e.g., gas/oil/water/sand (g/o/w/s) in all possible combinations, drilling mud with cuttings and g/o/w/s, in the storage and transport of wet or dry particulates, e.g., fluidized beds, slurries and sedimentation, e.g., as in dredging, in the nuclear power industries, e.g., entrained air, and steam at supercritical temperatures in cooling water in pressurized water reactors. Most of these processes have different flow regimes with varying distributions of the different materials/phases, flowing at different speeds and spread over the cross-section of the conduit supporting the flow, an important topic in CFD studies and software development. These processes are monitored with a plethora of sensors, continuously gathering vast amount of valuable data from various locations with many control loops distributed in the processes with a dedicated overall process control using different strategies, which recently have AI and machine learning techniques in their portfolio. The data from the sensors are valuable in data fusion not only for deterministic mechanistic modeling but also for exploratory data analysis (EDA), a growing branch of AI-based industrial machine learning. Data from process tomography/tomometry using nonintrusive and noninvasive sensing provide big data in real time, useful in identifying various flow phenomena, such as flow regimes, tunneling flow in silos, infiltration of sand in pipes, unusually high presence of gas bubbles in cooling water, etc. In this chapter, some applications of ECT and EIT in the above three process industries are presented. This chapter focuses on the sensor arrays and protocols used along with excitation and sensing methods used in the ECT/EIT modules and then presents some results from EDA as applied in the growing field of industrial machine learning. In all the three branches of process industries mentioned above, interesting results are presented showing possibilities of flow regime identification based on the distribution of the phases involved with the possibilities of integrating ECT/EIT in model free adaptive control of these processes.","Fluidized bed column (FBC),Neural networks,Multiphase flow,Process safety,Sensor data fusion,Process industries,Electrical capacitance/impedance tomography (ECT/EIT),Process tomography,Flow regime,Model free adaptive control (MFAC),Pressurized water reactors,Machine learning,"
"impact of past mining activities on water quality in a karst area in the cévennes region, southern france","2023","Sampling and analysis of groundwater and surface water were conducted to assess the potential impacts of abandoned mines on water quality in a karst area in Southern France. The results of multivariate statistical analysis and geochemical mapping revealed that water quality is affected by contaminated drainage from abandoned mine sites. Acid mine drainage with very high concentrations of Fe, Mn, Al, Pb and Zn was identified in a few samples collected from mine openings and near waste dumps. In general, neutral drainage with elevated concentrations of Fe, Mn, Zn, As, Ni and Cd was observed due to buffering by carbonate dissolution. The contamination is spatially limited around abandoned mine sites, suggesting that metal(oid)s are sequestered in secondary phases that form under near-neutral and oxidizing conditions. However, the analysis of seasonal variations in trace metal concentrations showed that the transport of metal contaminants in water is highly variable according to hydrological conditions. During low flow conditions, trace metals are likely to be rapidly sequestered in Fe-oxyhydroxides and carbonate minerals in the karst aquifer and the river sediments, while low or no surface runoff in intermittent rivers limits the transport of contaminants in the environment. On the other hand, significant amounts of metal(loid)s can be transported under high flow conditions, primarily in dissolved form. Dissolved metal(loid) concentrations in groundwater remained elevated despite dilution by uncontaminated water, likely as a result of the increased leaching of mine wastes and the flushing of contaminated waters from mine workings. This work shows that groundwater is the main source of contamination to the environment and highlights the need to better understand the fate of trace metals in karst water systems.","Compositional data analysis,Seasonal variations,Groundwater,Trace metals,Croix-de-Pallières,Mine drainage,"
"a new approach to collection bias in academic libraries: the extent of corporate control in journal holdings","1997","Questions of collection bias in library journal collections usually turn on a left-right political contrast. This article presents another approach that distinguishes between corporate and non-corporate controlled publications. Using this method, the catalog holdings of all Canadian academic libraries were searched to determine the penetration of socio-political titles of mainstream “corporate publishers” and those of “small publishers.” Canadian academic libraries privilege, by a wide margin, mainstream titles published by corporate entities, although some libraries have impressive “small publisher” collections. This article also analyzed the availability of mainstream and small publisher journals provided by ten popular electronic vendors. These vendors provide very low access to non-corporate “small publisher” titles while covering 100% of surveyed mainstream titles. The implications of such provision rates are examined from the perspective of the scholarly browsing process and the role of the university.",""
"function-shape-based particle swarm optimization and its application in maritime static target cooperative search","2017","The application of particle swarm algorithm in optimization has been growing over the last few years, but this approach becomes computationally impracticable when the complexity of the problem increases. In this context, an improvement of the particle swarm algorithm-the function-shape-based particle swarm optimization (FSPSO) is presented. For a practical maritime cooperative search problem, FSPSO makes particles move around in the corresponding solution space according to certain rules to gather information firstly. Then FSPSO exploits the history data acquired during the first process to analyze the shape of the solution space. Based on the knowledge about the function shape, FSPSO generates solutions and iteration strategies. At last, the position and speed of each particle will be updated iteratively, aiming at producing a high quality solution to the optimization problem. The main idea behind FSPSO is to hybridize PSO with the search mode of a human being. This paper uses maritime static target cooperative search as a test domain. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of FSPSO, we perform a comparison between the performances of FSPSO with other approaches drawn from the scientific literature. Results demonstrate that FSPSO is able to produce statistically significantly higher quality solutions, outperforming many other approaches.","Decoding,Generators,history data,heuristics,information theory,particle swarm optimisation,Software packages,particle swarm optimization,maritime search,Multiplexing,iteration strategies,practical maritime cooperative search problem,Complexity theory,search problems,function shape,maritime static target cooperative search,FSPSO,function-shape,Algorithm design and analysis,cooperative,particle swarm algorithm-the,Field programmable gate arrays,"
"motion modeling and simulation of maritime autonomous surface ships in realistic environmental disturbances","2020","A novel modeling and simulation pipeline is proposed in this paper to predict the six-degrees-of-freedom (6-DOF) motion of MASS under realistic environmental disturbances. The MASS model consists of several physics-based differential equations that are built based on state-of-the-art studies. The onboard sensors are utilized to drive the MASS model to keep the consistent control input with the real ships. A build-in hydrodynamic database describes the motion characteristics of ships. Moreover, an actual sea database is developed based on the third-generation wave numerical model to reproduce the ocean characteristics in the simulation. The spatial-and time-varying environmental vector fields are obtained from the real sea database to ensure consistency with the real environment. Three real voyage cases are reproduced by the presented method. The simulation results are compared with the records from onboard sensors for validation. The RMSE of the simulated trajectories is 3.789', 3.110', and 1.318' under the single influence of disturbances due to the inappropriate description of the real sea. Under the coupling disturbances, the RMSE of trajectories reduces to 0.1829', 0.5249', and 0.4030'. Consequently, the results indicate that the ocean database accurately reflected the ocean characteristics realistically, and the presented method can effectively predict the motions of the real ship under the actual sea environmental disturbances.","onboard sensors,control system synthesis,state-of-the-art studies,third-generation wave numerical model,remotely operated vehicles,maritime autonomous surface ships,Marine vehicles,ship,Mathematical model,coupling disturbances,simulated trajectories,spatial- time-varying environmental vector fields,Predictive models,realistic environmental disturbances,ships,differential equations,hydrodynamic database,hydrodynamics,motion control,Databases,Oceans,position control,ocean database,motion modeling,motion characteristics,actual sea environmental disturbances,physics-based differential equations,Hydrodynamics,Numerical models,time series,six-degrees-of-freedom,actual sea database,mobile robots,MASS model,marine control,numerical analysis,consistent control input,ocean characteristics,"
"intensified aridity over the indo-pacific warm pool controlled by ice-sheet expansion during the last glacial maximum","2022","The magnitude, direction and cause of precipitation changes across the Indo-Pacific Warm Pool (IPWP) during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) remain elusive. In particular, it is still inconclusive whether tropical or extra-tropical factors controlled such precipitation changes. Determining the spatio-temporal distribution of precipitation in the IPWP during the LGM is a valid strategy to address this issue, but the existing precipitation records are dominantly from maritime continents and marginal seas, with few data from pelagic oceans. In order to fill this gap, we analyzed the oxygen isotopic compositions of single Ethmodiscus rex diatom frustules (δ18OE. rex) from a sediment core (WPD-03) consisting of laminated diatom mats (LDMs) in the eastern Philippine Sea (EPS). δ18OE. rex was controlled mainly by sea-surface salinity variation and, thus, can reflect open-ocean precipitation changes across the IPWP. Our precipitation proxy records, in combination with existing published data, reveal spatial patterns of precipitation change that indicate overall drying across the IPWP during the LGM. Based on a comparison of paleoclimatic records with modeling results, we propose that extra-tropical factors (ice-sheet size) controlled precipitation variability in the IPWP during the LGM through a combination of zonal shifts of ENSO and meridional migration of the ITCZ. Strong aridity during the LGM prevented formation of a subsurface barrier layer and, hence, allowed accessing of sufficient nutrients to surface waters, stimulating blooms of E. rex and subsequent formation of LDMs in the IPWP. These findings suggest an important role for high-latitude climate in the tropical hydrological cycle during the LGM.","Tropical West Pacific,Diatom blooms,Sea-surface salinity,Model simulation,Tropical hydroclimate,High-latitude forcing,"

"a novel model for ship trajectory anomaly detection based on gaussian mixture variational autoencoder","2023","The use of traditional methods in anomaly detection of multi-class ship trajectories showed some limitations in terms of robustness and learning ability of trajectory features. In view of this, an anomaly detection model for ship trajectory data based on Gaussian Mixture Variational Autoencoder (GMVAE) is proposed in this study using an unsupervised classification method. The proposed model modifies Variational Autoencoder (VAE) by changing the inferential distribution of prior distribution and approximate posterior to the Gaussian mixture model. A high-dimensional hidden space is constructed to learn the features of multi-class trajectory data, and the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) method is applied to measure the error between the reconstructed trajectory and the original trajectory in order to judge whether the ship trajectory is abnormal. The Automatic Identification System (AIS) data from the US coastal areas are used to verify the proposed model, and the results are compared with other commonly used models in a manually labeled dataset. The research results indicate that the detection rate of the proposed model is 91.26%, and the false alarm rate is 0.68%, which performs the best. Using the Gaussian mixture model to describe the distribution of hidden space can improve the learning ability of multi-class trajectories of VAE, thus increasing the robustness of the model. This research can provide technical support for ship trajectory data analysis and risk management of maritime transportation.","Trajectory,anomaly detection of ship trajectory,Clustering algorithms,Classification algorithms,Mathematical models,gaussian mixture variational autoencoder (gmvae),unsupervised learning,Gaussian distribution,Marine vehicles,Artificial neural networks,intelligent transportation,AIS,"

Therefore, with the increasing demands and needs for robotics, the modular robotic domain was introduced as an essential key part of Internet-of-Things (IoT). Modular self-configurable robotic systems (E.g. swarms) are classed as “smart” autonomous machines with kinematic properties, defined by a set of interconnected links, modules and algorithms to achieve the required three-dimensional (3D) or two-dimensional (2D) complex shape or hierarchical structure. Due to its “intelligent” concept, it beame suitable for its deployment in the Internet of Robotic Things (IoRT) domain. Thus, becoming a key part of it and establishing itself as the newly revolutionised Internet of Modular Robotic Things (IoMRT). This paper presents a survey that highlights and discusses this novel IoMRT concept that focuses on self-reconfigurable modular robots and robotic systems by discussing their criteria, characteristics, architecture, and design. The security, safety, and privacy aspects are also presented and discussed, making it among the first papers to focus on this topic and its future.

"texture anomaly detection in radar imagery","1994","A radar image of the land or sea will contain extended regions of apparently homogeneous textures arising from, for example, forested areas or uniformly driven expanses of water. However, such regions may contain subtle texture anomalies which indicate the presence of a feature of interest such as a change in tree density due to environmental effects, damping of the sea surface due to the presence of pollutants or the presence of land-based or maritime military targets. For this reason, it is of interest to develop methods of detecting anomalies in textured regions. A strategy for texture anomaly detection is to estimate the multi-variate probability density function (PDF) of a texture segment using the whole homogeneous region as training data and then to calculate the likelihood of occurrence of each individual segment within the region given the PDF estimate. Those texture segments with anomalous likelihood values can then be flagged as potential texture anomalies.<>","Image texture analysis,radar imagery,PDF estimate,image texture,texture segment,Statistics,statistical analysis,texture anomaly detection,multi-variate probability density,Radar,radar image,texture segments,radar,"
"graph representation learning with encoding edges","2019","Network embedding aims at learning the low dimensional representation of nodes. These representations can be widely used for network mining tasks, such as link prediction, anomaly detection, and classification. Recently, a great deal of meaningful research work has been carried out on this emerging network analysis paradigm. The real-world network contains different size clusters because of the edges with different relationship types. These clusters also reflect some features of nodes, which can contribute to the optimization of the feature representation of nodes. However, existing network embedding methods do not distinguish these relationship types. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised network representation learning model that can encode edge relationship information. Firstly, an objective function is defined, which can learn the edge vectors by implicit clustering. Then, a biased random walk is designed to generate a series of node sequences, which are put into Skip-Gram to learn the low dimensional node representations. Extensive experiments are conducted on several network datasets. Compared with the state-of-art baselines, the proposed method is able to achieve favorable and stable results in multi-label classification and link prediction tasks.","Edge representation,Feature learning,Network mining,Network embedding,"

"long-term trends in submicron particle concentrations in a metropolitan area of the northeastern united states","2018","Significant changes in emission sources have occurred in the northeastern United States over the past decade, due in part to the implementation of emissions standards, the introduction and addition of abatement technologies for road transport, changes in fuel sulfur content for road and non-road transport, as well as economic impacts of a major recession and differential fuel prices. These changes in emission scenarios likely affected the concentrations of airborne submicron particles. This study investigated the characteristics of 11–500nm particle number concentrations and their size spectra in Rochester, NY during the past 15years (2002 to 2016). The modal structure, diurnal, weekly and monthly patterns of particle number concentrations are analyzed. Long-term trends are quantified using seasonal-trend decomposition procedures based on “Loess”, Mann-Kendall regression with Theil-Sen slope and piecewise regression. Particle concentrations underwent significant (p<0.05) downward trends. An annual decrease of −323particles/cm3/y (−4.6%/y) was estimated for the total particle number concentration using Theil-Sen analysis. The trends were driven mainly by the decrease in particles in the 11–50nm range (−181particles/cm3/y; −4.7%/y). Slope changes were investigated annually and seasonally. Piecewise regression found different slopes for different portions of the overall period with the strongest declines between 2005 and 2011/2013, followed by small upward trends between 2013 and 2016 for most size bins, possibly representing increased vehicular traffic after the recovery from the 2008 recession.","Number concentration,Sources,Trends,Ultrafine particles,"
"new frontiers in the risk assessment of ship collision","2023","Navigation is becoming more and more complex over the years. The increase in maritime traffic and vessel size is inducing a global escalation of ship collision accidents, with consequent losses of human lives and economic assets worth billions. This is particularly true for port basins, with maritime authorities struggling worldwide to keep up with the ever-increasing ship traffic. In this respect, the demand for advanced methods to assess and mitigate ship collision risk has never been higher. The interdependency between physical failures, weather conditions, logistics, governance and human factors requires sophisticated frameworks to effectively assist maritime authorities and navigators in decision-making. The present work reviews the most recent advancements in the risk assessment of ship collision. The article focuses on new, rising technologies, identifying the current main trends and discussing future perspectives and challenges. The review revealed a wide and diversified range of methods, including machine learning, clustering techniques, swarm intelligence algorithms and others. To frame the methods in the current literature and compare them with previous efforts, they are categorized according to literature classifications. Advancements of well-established approaches and new promising tools are discussed, considering methods that allow the inclusion of quantitative and qualitative variables in the assessment. Furthermore, a comprehensive analysis of a database of maritime accidents in port areas is carried out to investigate prevailing trends in both worldwide and Mediterranean Sea contexts. Results indicate that ship collision accidents constitute the majority compared with other types of accidents, especially in the Mediterranean.","Collision avoidance,Swarm intelligence,Neural network,Bayesian network,Maritime safety,Navigation risk,"

"long-range dependence in north atlantic sea level","2006","Sea level is an important parameter in climate and oceanographic applications. In this work the scaling behavior of sea level is analyzed from time series of sea level observations. The wavelet domain is particularly attractive for the identification of scaling behavior in an observed time series. The wavelet spectrum from a scale-by-scale wavelet analysis of variance reproduces in the wavelet domain the power laws underlying a scaling process, allowing the estimation of the scaling exponent from the slope of the wavelet spectrum. Here the scaling exponent is estimated in the wavelet domain for time series of sea level observations in the North Atlantic: at coastal sites from tide gauges, covering 50 years of monthly measurements, and in the open ocean from satellite altimetry, covering 12 years of satellite measurements at 10 days intervals. Both tide gauge and altimetry time series exhibit scaling behavior. Furthermore, the degree of stochastic persistence is spatially coherent and distinct at the coast and in the open ocean. Near the coast, the stochastic structure of the sea level observations is characterized by long-range dependence with a moderate degree of persistence. Larger values of the scaling exponent, consistent with weaker persistence, are concentrated in the northern Atlantic. At mid-latitudes the stochastic dependence of sea level observations is characterized by strong persistence in the form of strong long-range and 1/f dependence.","Scaling,North Atlantic,Sea level,Wavelet methods,"

We propose a multi-class artificial neural network (ANN)-based anomaly detection framework to classify intentional and non-intentional AIS on-off switching anomalies. The multi-class anomaly framework captures AIS message dropouts due to various reasons, e.g., channel effects or intentional one for carrying illegal activities. We extract position, speed, course and timing information from real world AIS data, and use them to train a 2-class (normal and anomaly) and a 3-class (normal, power outage and anomaly) anomaly detection models.

"interactive visualization of normal behavioral models and expert rules for maritime anomaly detection","2009","Maritime surveillance systems analyze vast amounts of heterogeneous sensor data from a large number of objects. In order to support the operator while monitoring such systems, the identification of anomalous vessels or situations that might need further investigation may reduce the operator's cognitive load. While it is worth acknowledging that many existing mining applications support identification of anomalous behavior, autonomous anomaly detection systems are rarely used in the real world, since the detection of anomalous behavior is normally not a well-defined problem and therefore, human expert knowledge is needed.

"propagation of uncertainty in a simulation-based maritime risk assessment model utilizing bayesian simulation techniques","2003","Recent studies in the assessment of risk in maritime transportation systems have used simulation-based probabilistic techniques. Amongst them are the San Francisco Bay (SFB) Ferry exposure assessment in 2002, the Washington State Ferry (WFS) Risk Assessment in 1998 and the Prince William Sound (PWS) Risk Assessment in 1996. Representing uncertainty in such simulation models is fundamental to quantifying system risk. This paper illustrates the representation of uncertainty in simulation using Bayesian techniques to model input and output uncertainty. These uncertainty representations describe system randomness as well as lack of knowledge about the system. The study of the impact of proposed ferry service expansions in San Francisco Bay is used as a case study to demonstrate the Bayesian simulation technique. Such characterization of uncertainty in simulation-based analysis provides the user with a greater level of information enabling improved decision making.","ferry service expansions,digital simulation,simulation-based maritime risk assessment model,naval engineering computing,Transportation,Risk management,Bayesian techniques,Safety,maritime transportation systems,Operations research,knowledge representation,Risk analysis,transportation,Bayes methods,system knowledge,Information analysis,Modeling,Prince William Sound,system randomness,marine systems,Bayesian methods,PWS Risk Assessment,simulation-based analysis,probabilistic techniques,uncertainty representation,WFS Risk Assessment,system risk quantification,Washington State Ferry,random processes,decision making,exposure assessment,uncertainty handling,San Francisco Bay Ferry,SFB Ferry,probability,Uncertainty,uncertainty propagation,Bayesian simulation techniques,Analytical models,simulation models,"
"reconstructing holocene shore displacement and stone age palaeogeography from a foredune sequence on ruhnu island, gulf of riga, baltic sea","2018","Holocene shore displacement and the palaeogeography of Late Mesolithic and Late Neolithic settlements on Ruhnu Island, Gulf of Riga, were reconstructed using foredune sequence luminescence dating, sedimentological data supported by ground-penetrating radar analysis, and GIS-based landscape modelling. The foredune ridges consist of very well to well sorted fine- to medium-grained aeolian sand and are underlain by seaward dipping foreshore sediments. The studied sequence of 38 ridges was formed between 6.91±0.58ka and 2.54±0.19ka ago, and represents a period of falling relative sea level. Foredune plain progradation, with average rates of 0.3–0.6m per year, was controlled by isostatic land uplift, which caused a continuous withdrawal of shorelines to lower elevations. The dated foredune succession was used to reconstruct the coastal palaeogeography of the island. Palaeogeographical reconstructions show that during two phases of Late Mesolithic habitation, at ca. 7.2cal.ka BP and 6.2cal.ka BP, seal hunters settled the coastal zone of Ruhnu Island. Based on tool material and pottery type they could have originated from Saaremaa Island, which according to palaeoreconstruction of the Gulf of Riga, was located approximately 70km northwest of Ruhnu Island during the Late Mesolithic. Later signs of human occupation, radiocarbon dated to ca. 4.7cal.ka BP, were from the centre of the island, hundreds of metres away from the shore at about 8m above its contemporary sea level. This Late Neolithic habitation shows a clearly different pattern than earlier coastal settlement, and suggests a shift in subsistence strategy towards agriculture and animal husbandry.","Foredune,Stone Age settlement,Luminescence dating,Palaeogeography,Baltic Sea,Sea level changes,Beach ridges,"

"unsupervised anomaly detection for underwater gliders using generative adversarial networks","2021","An effective anomaly detection system is critical for marine autonomous systems operating in complex and dynamic marine environments to reduce operational costs and achieve concurrent large-scale fleet deployments. However, developing an automated fault detection system remains challenging for several reasons including limited data transmission via satellite services. Currently, most anomaly detection for marine autonomous systems, such as underwater gliders, rely on intensive analysis by pilots. This study proposes an unsupervised anomaly detection system using bidirectional generative adversarial networks guided by assistive hints for marine autonomous systems with time series data collected by multiple sensors. In this study, the anomaly detection system for a fleet of underwater gliders is trained on two healthy deployment datasets and tested on other nine deployment datasets collected by a selection of vehicles operating in a range of locations and environmental conditions. The system is successfully applied to detect anomalies in the nine test deployments, which include several different types of anomalies as well as healthy behaviour. Also, a sensitivity study of the data decimation settings suggests the proposed system is robust for Near Real-Time anomaly detection for underwater gliders.","Anomaly detection,Generative adversarial networks,Marine autonomous systems,Underwater gliders,"

"jurassic-recent stratigraphy, structure, and hydrocarbon potential of the mesozoic-cenozoic rifted-passive margin of the tarfaya-dakhla basin of southern morocco","2022","We describe the structure, stratigraphy, and hydrocarbon potential of the 1000-km-long Tarfaya-Dakhla Basin (TDB) along the Atlantic rifted-passive margin of Morocco. Our dataset consists of a 4885-line km grid of depth-converted industry seismic data tied to three DSDP wells in the deepwater area and exploratory wells on the slope and shelf. Based on mapping of this seismic grid, the tectonostratigraphic events that have affected this margin include: 1) a Late Triassic-Early Jurassic rift phase that separated the Moroccan margin from its conjugate margin in eastern Canada began during the Late Triassic-Early Jurassic; 2) early passive margin sedimentation consists of Middle Jurassic-Early Cretaceous passive margin phase consisting of a massive, 14-km-thick, reefal-carbonate platform formed above the rifted margin during the Early Jurassic and was subsequently buried by the 6-km-thick, Early Cretaceous (Berriasian) Boujdour deltaic complex. During this period continued high rates of clastic sedimentation resulted in margin steepening and gravitational collapse during the Valanginian and formed a 480-km-long and 68-km-wide passive margin fold belt characterized by a zone of updip normal faults of 480 km in length and 30 km in width and a zone of downdip folds and thrusts of 117 km in length and 15 km in width. Geochemical data from DSDP 397 and 369 wells and two pseudo-wells were used to evaluate source rock potential and hydrocarbon prospectivity of the Jurassic to Recent section. Basin modeling reveals that the Jurassic source rocks known from DSDP drilling are presently overmature in the study area with hydrocarbon generation beginning in the Upper Jurassic-Lower Cretaceous. The Lower Cretaceous source rocks are immature except for localized areas, and the Upper Cretaceous is immature across the study area.","Basin modeling,Shale detachment,Passive margin fold belt,Area-depth strain analysis,Offshore southern Morocco,Stratigraphy,Seismic interpretation,"

"hybrid approaches for container traffic forecasting in the context of anomalous events: the case of the yangtze river delta region in the covid-19 pandemic","2022","The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on container transportation. Accurate forecasting of container throughput is critical for policymakers and port authorities, especially in the context of the anomalous events of the COVID-19 pandemic. In this paper, we firstly proposed hybrid models for univariate time series forecasting to enhance prediction accuracy while eliminating the nonlinearity and multivariate limitations. Next, we compared the forecasting accuracy of different models with various training dataset extensions and forecasting horizons. Finally, we analysed the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on container throughput forecasting and container transportation. An empirical analysis of container throughputs in the Yangtze River Delta region was performed for illustration and verification purposes. Error metrics analysis suggests that SARIMA-LSTM2 and SARIMA-SVR2 (configuration 2) have the best performance compared to other models and they can better predict the container traffic in the context of anomalous events such as the COVID-19 pandemic. The results also reveal that, with an increase in the training dataset extensions, the accuracy of the models is improved, particularly in comparison with standard statistical models (i.e. SARIMA model). An accurate prediction can help strategic management and policymakers to better respond to the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.","SARIMA model,COVID-19 pandemic,Hybrid model,Machine learning model,Yangtze River Delta multi-port region,"

"cultural dynamics and ceramic resource use at late bronze age/early iron age troy, northwestern turkey","2013","Changes in resource use over time can provide insight into technological choice and the extent of long-term stability in cultural practices. In this paper we re-evaluate the evidence for a marked demographic shift at the inception of the Early Iron Age at Troy by applying a robust macroscale analysis of changing ceramic resource use over the Late Bronze and Iron Age. We use a combination of new and legacy analytical datasets (NAA and XRF), from excavated ceramics, to evaluate the potential compositional range of local resources (based on comparisons with sediments from within a 10 km site radius). Results show a clear distinction between sediment-defined local and non-local ceramic compositional groups. Two discrete local ceramic resources have been previously identified and we confirm a third local resource for a major class of EIA handmade wares and cooking pots. This third source appears to derive from a residual resource on the Troy peninsula (rather than adjacent alluvial valleys). The presence of a group of large and heavy pithoi among the non-local groups raises questions about their regional or maritime origin.","Local production,Bottom-up sampling,Macro-analysis,Multivariate analysis,Neutron Activation Analysis,Statistical power relationships,Legacy datasets,"

"long-term trends of upwelling and impacts on primary productivity in the alaskan beaufort sea","2013","Using a previously established wind proxy for upwelling along the North Slope of Alaska, we examine the interannual to decadal variability in upwelling as well as the climatological monthly trends. The ability of the upwelling to trigger phytoplankton blooms via upward nitrate flux from the halocline is then investigated using data from a moored array together with the proxy. The 70-year record of wind speed from the Barrow, Alaska meteorological station (1941–2010) reveals that strong upwelling events – lasting at least 4 days and exceeding 10m/s during the storm – occur throughout the year. On average there are 9–10 upwelling events per year, and the number and strength of events has increased over the last 25 years. The low-frequency variability in the upwelling co-varies with previously documented Arctic climate trends, but there is no significant correlation with various high latitude atmospheric indices. There are two seasonal peaks in the occurrence of upwelling, in May and November. The role of the Beaufort High and Aleutian Low in driving the upwelling is investigated using NCEP reanalysis fields. Fluctuations in both of these centers of action contribute to the enhanced winds, and the location of the Aleutian Low storm track plays a key role in the seasonal variability of the upwelling. The upward nitrate flux due to storms in the open water period can account for new primary production that is on par with carbon fixed during the summer growing season in the absence of storms. Evidence from satellite ocean color data of such wind-induced phytoplankton blooms is presented.","Primary production,Long-term wind trends,Upwelling trends,Nitrate flux,"

"hydroclimate variations over the last 17,000 years as estimated by leaf waxes in rodent middens from the south-central atacama desert, chile","2023","Leaf cuticular waxes are one of the most important environment-plant interaction structural systems that enable desert plants to withstand extreme climatic conditions. We present a long chain n-alkyl lipids study in fresh plant leaves and rodent palaeomiddens collected along an elevational gradient in the south-central Atacama Desert of Chile, covering six different vegetation belts: Steppe (4500-4000 m asl), Puna (4000-3300 m asl), pre-Puna (3300-2400 m asl), Absolute Desert (2400-1000 m asl) and Coastal Desert (1000-0 m asl). The 28 rodent palaeomiddens analyzed from Quebrada Incahuasi (25.6 °S, 3600 m asl) span the last 17,000 years. Modern-day distribution of long-chain n-alkanes and n-alkanoic acids varies among the dominant plant associations of the Atacama Desert. These plants show a species-specific chemotaxonomy linked to the climatic conditions. Furthermore, differences in average chain length (ACL) and carbon preference index (CPI) suggest that these plant communities are highly adapted to extreme environmental conditions. The sum of leaf wax n-alkanes was highest under wet conditions, while n-alkanoic acids (between n-C24 and n-C28) increased with hyperaridity. Similarly, analysis of n-alkane time series from palaeomiddens showed that the greatest changes in leaf wax n-alkane distributions (ACL and CPI) corresponded to the greatest increases in moisture during the Central Andean Pluvial Event (CAPE; between 18 and 9 ka cal BP) and the Late Holocene. The shift in the palaeomidden n-alkane distributions is corroborated by the relative abundance of rainfall-dependent extra-local taxa. This is the first study to report leaf wax content obtained from ancient rodent middens, and shows promising results as a robust hydroclimate proxy for the Atacama Desert region.","Pleistocene-Holocene transition,Leaf cuticular waxes,Chemo-taxonomy,Palaeoclimate,Central Andes Pluvial event,"
"geochemistry and petrology of witwatersrand and dwyka diamictites from south africa: search for an extraterrestrial component","2001","Diamictites are poorly sorted sediments characteristically carrying coarse-grained clasts in a fine-grained matrix. They have generally been considered of glaciogenic or glaciomarine origin. Recently, however, it has been suggested that some massive tillite/diamictite layers could represent impact breccias. An earlier petrographic study of rock and mineral clasts from Dwyka Group diamictites revealed no evidence for shock metamorphism, such as planar deformation features. Detailed geochemical studies of diamictite samples from the Archean Witwatersrand Supergroup and the Dwyka Group of the Mesozoic Karoo Supergroup from South Africa are reported. We studied the contents of the siderophile elements in these breccias, as elevated abundances of such elements, especially iridium, could be indicative for an impact origin. By use of γ-γ coincidence spectrometry and other trace element analysis, geochemical tracers of extraterrestrial components were sought. However, no enrichments of indicator elements for extraterrestrial components, compared with ordinary continental crust, were found. Thus, neither geochemical nor petrographic evidence supports an impact origin of the diamictites from the Dwyka Group and the Witwatersrand Supergroup in South Africa.",""
"maritime traffic route detection framework based on statistical density analysis from ais data using a clustering algorithm","2022","Maritime traffic routes by ships navigation vary according to country and geographic characteristics, and they differ according to the characteristics of the ships. In ocean areas adjacent to coasts, regulated routes are present, e.g., traffic separation scheme for ships entering and leaving; however, most ocean areas do not have such routes. Maritime traffic route research has been conducted based on computer engineering to create routes; however, ship characteristics were not considered. Thus, this article proposes a framework to generate maritime traffic routes using statistical density analysis. Here, automatic identification system (AIS) data are used to derive quantitative traffic routes. Preprocessing is applied to the AIS data, and a similar ship trajectory pattern is decomposed into a matrix based on the Hausdorffâ€“distance algorithm and then stored in a database. A similar pattern makes the AIS trajectory simple using the Douglasâ€“Peucker algorithm. In addition, density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) is performed to identify the waypoints of vessels then create routes by connecting waypoints. The width of maritime routes created based on a similar ship trajectory is subjected to kernel density estimation analysis (KDE). Then, waypoints evaluation of the main route is performed from the results of KDE 75% and 90% considering the statistical in the total maritime traffic, and the results applied to the targeted ocean area are compared. Finally, the result of KDE 90% of maritime traffic with framework analyzed the safety route, which can be a basis for developing routes for maritime autonomous surface ships.","traffic separation scheme,ocean areas,marine accidents,Clustering algorithms,Safety,targeted ocean area,Douglas-Peucker algorithm,automatic identification system data,vehicle routing,total maritime traffic,Marine vehicles,maritime autonomous surface ships,quantitative traffic routes,geographic characteristics,DBSCAN,statistical analysis,ships,marine safety,kernel density estimation,AIS trajectory simple,maritime traffic route detection framework,kernel density estimation analysis,Oceans,Hausdorff-distance algorithm,ship trajectory pattern,framework,pattern clustering,Artificial intelligence,statistical density analysis,marine engineering computing,Trajectory,ship characteristics,maritime traffic route research,Navigation,safety route,density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise,clustering algorithm,AIS data,maritime traffic route,"

"a sequential barrier-based model to evaluate human reliability in maritime accident process","2015","Human reliability is considered as the predominant causation factor in maritime accidents. The previous researches on human reliability analysis are reviewed in this paper, although these works have benefited us a lot in accident prevention, few researches focused on the human reliability in the developing stages of maritime accident process. This paper first thoroughly reviews the existing sequential accident process models, including the Swiss cheese model, accident causation model, risk-scenario based model, then the strengths and weakness of these models are compared with each other. To make a feasible and reasonable assessment on the human reliability, a sequential safety barrier-based model which includes four safety barriers are proposed by incorporating the safety barrier (SB) and risk scenario together. Moreover, the failure modes of different safety barriers, which consider the difficulty of these barriers' implementation, are also presented to further analyze the human reliability. The developing states, including initiating state (IE), mid states (MS), and end state (ES), and accident scenario of different types of accidents are also proposed under the framework of sequential safety barriers. Finally, this proposed model is introduced to investigate 97 maritime accident reports issued by Maritime Safety Administration (MSA) of China from 2000 to 2010. The result reveals that majority of the maritime accidents can be analyzed by the proposed accident process model (91.8%, N=97). It also demonstrates that different measures in terms of developing stages should be adopted to enhance the human reliability in the maritime accident process. Moreover, multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) reveals that human error is closely related with the catastrophic accident; moreover, it also demonstrates that majority of the accidents can be prevented or even avoided in the earlier stages.","marine accidents,mid states,Transportation,risk scenario,Safety,accident evolution,multiple correspondence analysis,Marine vehicles,humain reliability analysis,Grounding,reliability,Reliability,maritime accident process,human factors,sequential accident process models,accident prevention,Swiss cheese model,MCA,marine safety,Accidents,China,risk-scenario based model,Maritime Safety Administration,developing states,end state,sequential safety barrier-based model,accident causation model,catastrophic accidents,sequencial safety barriers,Analytical models,initiating state,MSA,human reliability analysis,sequential barrier-based model,"
"towards uncertainty and sensitivity analysis for modal parameters identification during ice–structure interaction","2023","The integrity of offshore structures is prone to the threat of drifting sea ice. By exciting the natural frequencies of the ice–structure interaction system, severe vibrations may occur. For a better understanding of how dynamic ice–structure interaction affects the system properties, a stochastic subspace system identification technique, SSI-cov is introduced to identify modal parameters during dynamic ice–structure interactions. Due to the uncertain input variables of SSI-cov, the identified modal parameters suffer from the quantitative judgment of the analyst. To address this problem, this study proposes an uncertainty analysis (UA) framework to obtain estimates of modal parameters. This framework constitutes both a sensitivity analysis (SA) and a UA. First, SA is applied to pick up the input variables that contribute the most to the identified modal parameters. Next, the important variables are left free to vary over their range of existence to obtain the modal parameters’ uncertainties. The framework is applied to full-scale tests from Norströmsgrund lighthouse and model tests carried out in Hamburg Ship Model Basin (HSVA). The comparison with traditional automated modal parameter identification shows its superiority in terms of the accuracy of modal parameters.","Sensitivity analysis,Modal parameter identification,SSI-cov,Uncertainty analysis,Ice–structure interactions,"

"application of aerosol classification methods based on aeronet version 3 product over eastern mediterranean and black sea","2020","Aerosols released into the atmosphere from anthropogenic sources and natural events affect human health, reduce visibility, and alter Earth's radiation budget. Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) is a quantitative estimate of the amount of aerosol present in the atmosphere, and it can be used as a proxy for surface particulate matters. The AERONET is a network of ground-based sun photometers, providing globally AOD data. Long-term ground-based measurements from all point AERONET V3 Level 2.0 data at 10 sites in the eastern Mediterranean and the Black Sea region covering the countries of Turkey, Romania, Greece, Ukraine and Cyprus were used to determine spatial and temporal distribution of the selected aerosol parameters such as AOD at 440, 500, 870 nm (AOD440, AOD500, AOD870), Angstrom Exponent at 440–870 nm (AE440-870) and fine mode fraction at 500 nm (FMF500) for the period of 1999–2018. Since the combination of AOD, AE440-870 and FMF500 enables categorization of aerosol types, two different classification methods were compared in the region. The first method (M1) divides the aerosols into three categories (marine, desert dust and continental) using the parameters of AOD500 and FMF500 whereas the second method (M2) has five categorizations (marine, continental, biomass burning, desert dust, and mixed-type) using the parameters of AOD440 and AE440-870. The multiyear averaged AOD and AE spatiotemporal variability over the region was also presented at a spatial resolution of 0.5° × 0.625° based on MERRA-2 reanalysis data. The results indicate that marine aerosol was the most predominant type in both methods while continental aerosol type was also obtained at a high rate over the region. The highest AOD occurred in summer, while lowest values were observed in winter. A high volume of fine-mode particles was observed during summer with higher AE values caused by carbonaceous aerosols from biomass burning mainly observed at north-western part of the region. In contrast with that, coarse-mode particles, mainly dust, dominated with lower AE values during spring over the southern and eastern parts of the region.","The black sea,AERONET,The eastern mediterranean,AOD,Aerosol classification,"
"butyltin residues in blue mussels (mytilus edulis) and arkshells (scapharca broughtonii) collected from korean coastal waters","2002","Butyltin compounds (BTs) including tributyltin (TBT) and its degradation products, di- (DBT) and mono-butyltin (MBT), were determined in bivalves such as blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) and arkshells (Scapharca broughtonii) collected from Korean coastal waters. BTs were detected in all the blue mussels and arkshells analyzed. The concentrations of total butyltin (ΣBTs: MBT+DBT+TBT) in blue mussels and arkshells ranged from 49 to 2500 ng/g and 29 to 87 ng/g wet weight, respectively. Higher concentrations of BTs were found in blue mussels collected from Okpo and Kohyonsong Bays and Jangsengpo Harbor where large shipyards and harbors are located with dry-dock facilities. This suggested that maritime activities nearby the harbors play a major role as the source of BTs. Concentrations of TBT in mussels collected from Korea were one of the highest values reported, suggesting ongoing TBT contamination in Korea. Among BTs, TBT was the predominant compound both in blue mussels and arkshells collected from almost all the sampling locations, indicating the fresh input of TBT in Korean coastal waters. Smaller mussels tended to accumulate BTs at higher concentrations than larger ones, which may be due to higher filtration rate of small mussels and/or contact with surface microlayer in intertidal zones.","Blue mussel (),Butyltin compounds,Korean coastal waters,Antifouling paint,TBT,"

"forensic readiness within the maritime sector","2019","Forensic investigation is an essential response strategy following a cyber-related incident, and forensic readiness is the capability to gather critical digital information and maximize its use as evidence. The effectiveness of this data is highly dependent on the readiness, quality, and trustworthiness of the data itself. Far from a passive post-analysis tool, there have been many instances where an organization has benefited from gathering, and using, digital evidence to improve their cyber-security and mitigate future incidents. This article examines the forensic readiness of the maritime sector, a core component of global trade and a unique combination of information/operational technology and people, to understand its investigation and mitigation capabilities. Once the readiness of maritime forensic investigation has been better understood, by comparing it to other sectors and using risk scenarios, this paper proposes actions toward improvement. These steps are built from established attempts to increase investigation capabilities and improve maritime cyber-security, but address the maritime sector specifically.","maritime,investigation capabilities,forensic readiness,maritime sector,digital evidence,cyber-related incident,cyber,trusted computing,maritime forensic investigation,marine engineering,risk,digital forensics,mitigation capabilities,maritime cyber-security,"

"resilience assessment of maritime container shipping networks â€“ a case of the maritime silk road","2019","This paper presents a framework for the resilience assessment of maritime shipping networks by quantifying its recovery performance under natural hazards. The vulnerability of the maritime shipping network is measured according to the variation of network efficiency and the relative size of the largest connected subgraph in the face of the disruption of transportation systems (shutdown of ports). The service performance of the maritime shipping network is indicated by the global network efficiency, and the resilience of maritime shipping network is associated to the network performance loss triangle considering the whole process from a partial disruption to full recovery. The proposed resilience assessment method is applied to a container shipping network of the Maritime Silk Road (MSR) under the storm risks. Two recovery strategies, which are random recovery strategy and multi-centrality based recovery strategy, are adopted respectively, and the recovery performance of the container shipping network under different strategies are comparatively analyzed. The research results can be used to not only support the identification of the weak points of the maritime transportation network along the MSR through vulnerability analysis but also provide a reference for the effective risk management of maritime transportation, so as to improve the safety and reliability of the whole system.","Transportation,Risk management,storm risks,Safety,transportation,Resilience,subgraph,maritime container shipping networks,maritime risk,ships,Containers,marine safety,natural hazards,risk management,storms,maritime transportation network,sea ports,graph theory,network performance loss triangle,global network efficiency,maritime shipping network,Indexes,resilience assessment,Container shipping network,hazards,multi-centrality,Loss measurement,transportation resilience,multicentrality based recovery strategy,transportation systems,random recovery strategy,maritime silk road,"

"perturbation analysis for maritime applications","2012","Target detection of marine features is a major topic for the security and monitoring of coastlines. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) has been shown to be particularly useful because of its all-weather and night capability. In this paper a methodology based on the perturbation analysis developed by the authors is presented. The latter can be applied for detection of ships (non-marine targets) or classification of sea ice. The algorithm can be considered to be a negative filter focused on sea. Consequently, all the features which have a polarimetric behaviour different from the sea are detected and considered as targets. A complete validation with RADARSAT-2 full polarimetric data was performed in Portsmouth, UK. An accurate ground truth carried out during the acquisition, was accompanied, considering AIS GPS location and photographic evidences. Moreover, a map of the buoys helped locating this typology of targets. The results showed impressive accuracy, with detection of all the vessels seen during the ground truth.","Clutter,Classification algorithms,Vectors,Scattering,Marine vehicles,Detectors,Feature extraction,"
"monotonic trends in spatio-temporal distribution and concentration of monsoon precipitation (1901–2002), west bengal, india","2016","This paper intended to investigate spatio-temporal monotonic trend and shift in concentration of monsoon precipitation across West Bengal, India, by analysing the time series of monthly precipitation from 18 weather stations during the period from 1901 to 2002. In dealing with, the inhomogeneity in the precipitation series, RHtestsV4 software package is used to detect, and adjust for, multiple change points (shifts) that could exist in data series. Finally, the cumulative deviation test was applied at 5% significant level to check the homogeneity (presence of historic changes by cumulative deviations test). Afterward, non-parametric Mann-Kendall (MK) test and Theil-Sen estimator (TSE) was applied to detect of nature and slope of trends; and, Sequential Mann Kendall (SQMK) test was applied for detection of turning point and magnitude of change in trends. Prior to the application of statistical tests, the pre-whitening technique was used to eliminate the effect of autocorrelation in precipitation data series. Four indices- precipitation concentration index (PCI), precipitation concentration degree (PCD), precipitation concentration period (PCP) and fulcrum (centre of gravity) were used to detect precipitation concentration and the spatial pattern in it. The application of the above-mentioned procedures has shown very notable statewide monotonic trend for monsoon precipitation time series. Regional cluster analysis by SQMK found increasing precipitation in mountain and coastal regions in general, except during the non- monsoon seasons. The results show that higher PCI values were mainly observed in South Bengal, whereas lower PCI values were mostly detected in North Bengal. The PCI values are noticeably larger in places where both monsoon total precipitation and span of rainy season are lower. The results of PCP reveal that precipitation in Gangetic Bengal mostly occurs in summer (monsoon season), and the rainy season arrives earlier in North Bengal than South Bengal, whereas the results of PCD also indicate that the precipitation in North Bengal was more dispersed within a year than that in South Bengal. The concentration characteristic of precipitation could be detected by fulcrum analysis, and significant concentration over most of West Bengal was obvious within July month band. Precipitation trend observed in West Bengal is compared with that in Central India (CI) region and comparison of precipitation departure with Indian monsoon and Gangetic Bengal can be explained by forecasting ensemble.","Monotonic trend,Central India (CI),Shift in concentration,Precipitation concentration degree (PCD),Precipitation concentration period (PCP),Precipitation concentration index (PCI),Fulcrum (centre of gravity),Monsoon precipitation,"
"an integrated framework for assessing and mitigating risks to maritime critical infrastructure","2007","Maritime security poses daunting challenges of protecting thousands of potential targets, fixed and mobile, dispersed across US coasts and waterways. We describe an integrated approach to systematically assessing risks and prospective strategies for mitigating those risks. The maritime security risk analysis model (MSRAM) quantifies maritime risk in terms of threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences. We are extending MSRAM with novel 'what-if' behavioral simulation software that projects the likely reduction of risks over time from adopting strategies for allocating existing security assets and investing in new security capabilities. Projected outcomes (and costs) can then be compared to identify the most robust strategies for mitigating risk. This decision support method can be re-applied over time as strategies are executed, to re-validate and adjust them in response to changing conditions and terrorist behaviors. This dynamic portfolio-based approach improves confidence, consistency, and quality of risk management decisions.

"change in silica sources in roman and post-roman glass","2003","Although Roman and post-Empire glasses found in Europe are reputed to have a very constant composition and hence source of components, it appears that some 4–5th century and later specimens show evidence of a different source of silica (sand) component. Zirconium and titanium are the discriminating elements. Data presented here for 278 specimens from 1st to 4th century German and Belgian samples indicate a strongly homogeneous Zr and Ti content; N: number of analyzed samples while 62 samples from Maastricht show low Zr–Ti contents from 1st to 3rd century samples while 4–5th century samples show a strong trend of concomitant Ti and Zr increase. If the high values of Zr–Ti represent a new source of silica (sand) the trend from low to high content suggests that a significant amount of low Zr–Ti glass was recycled to form these glass objects. Similar high Ti content can be seen in analysis results reported for other but not all 4–5th century samples found in northern Europe while earlier productions show typical low Ti contents. Although the fusing agent for these glasses seems to have always been natron (a mineral deposit in the Nile delta) from Hellenistic times to the 9th century, a change in the silica source, indicated by variation of the Ti and Zr content, could very well reflect the results of political instability of the 4–5th century exemplified by the fragmentation of the Roman Empire into two parts.","Silica sources,Roman and post-Roman glass,Glass objects,"
"variability of usa east coast surface total alkalinity distributions revealed by automated instrument measurements","2021","Seawater total alkalinity (TA) is one important determinant used to monitor the ocean carbon cycle, whose spatial distributions have previously been characterized along the United States East Coast via discrete bottle samples. Using these data, several regional models for TA retrievals based on practical salinity (S) have been developed. Broad-scale seasonal or interannual variations, however, are not well resolved in these models and existing data are highly seasonally biased. This study reports findings from the first long duration deployment of a new, commercially available TA titrator aboard a research vessel and the continuous underway surface TA measurements produced. The instrument, operated on seven East Coast USA cruises during six months in 2017 and for two months in 2018 on the summertime East Coast Ocean Acidification survey (ECOA-2), collected a total of nearly 11,000 surface TA measurements. Data from these efforts, along with a newly synthesized set of more than 11,000 regional surface TA observations, are analyzed to re-examine distributions of TA and S along the United States East Coast. Overall, regional distributions of S and TA generally agreed with prior findings, but linear TA:S regressions varied markedly over time and deviated from previously developed models. This variability is likely due to a combination of biological, seasonal, and episodic influences and indicates that substantial errors of ±10–20 μmol kg−1 in TA estimation from S can be expected due to these factors. This finding has likely implications for numerical ecosystem modeling and inorganic carbon system calculations. New results presented in this paper provide refined surface TA:S relationships, present more data in space and time, and improve TA modeling uncertainty.","Surface water,Total alkalinity,Atlantic Ocean,East Coast,Coastal,USA,"
"non-satellite broadband maritime communications for e-navigation services","2021","The development of broadband network access technologies available to users on land has triggered a rapid expansion of a diverse range of services provided by terrestrial networks. However, due to limitations of digital communication technologies in the off-shore area, the maritime ICT systems evolution so far has not followed that trend. Despite the e-navigation initiative defining the set of Maritime Services, the progress in the maritime ICT systems evolution has been slow. Only a few systems, including the VHF Data Exchange System (VDES), or the TRI-Media Telematic Oceanographic Network (TRITON) have been proposed to extend the basic set of services offered by classical radio-communication solutions. However, all those systems have significant limitations. The purpose of this paper is to introduce the netBaltic system designed as a fully heterogeneous system for modern maritime communications. Its unique feature is the capability to transparently use different communication technologies to efficiently support maritime ICT services, as well as openness for the incorporation of future communication technologies. The paper presents an overview of VDES, TRITON and netBaltic systems and analysis showing their expected strengths and weaknesses. The systems are then compared in simulated environments, illustrating real-world usage scenarios based on real maritime traffic information and performance measurements obtained during off-shore measurement campaigns. Results indicate that netBaltic seems to be the most versatile one and is capable of offering access to all services defined by International Maritime Organization, due to its ability to use different communication technologies simultaneously and functionality offered by its Delay Tolerant Networking component.","international maritime organization,Safety,wireless mesh networks,broadband network access technologies,wireless communication,Organizations,Communication systems,Wireless communication,VHF data exchange system,maritime ICT services,future communication technologies,maritime ICT systems evolution,different communication technologies,satellite communication,data communication,performance measurements,terrestrial networks,Broadband communication,digital communication technologies,TRI media telematic oceanographic network,modern maritime communications,netBaltic system,maritime services,maritime traffic information,telecommunication traffic,fully heterogeneous system,marine technology,classical radio communication solution,nonsatellite broadband maritime communications,broadband networks,computer networks,marine communication,e-navigation Services,network topology,mobile communication,Navigation,Task analysis,Information and communication technology,"

"gold nanoparticle assisted colorimetric biosensors for rapid polyethylene terephthalate (pet) sensing for sustainable environment to monitor microplastics","2023","The extremely widespread and ubiquitous nature of plastics, estimated to boost its global production by 26 billion tons till 2050. The large chunks of plastic waste that decomposed down to micro- or nano plastics (MNPs) leads to various ill effects on biological entities. The conventional PET detection methods lack rapid detection of microplastics due to variances in microplastic features, long-drawn-out sample pre-processing procedures and complex instrumentation. Therefore, an instantaneous colorimetric evaluation of microplastic will ensures the simplicity of conducting assays on field. Several nanoparticle-based biosensors that detects proteins, nucleic acids, metabolites operate on either cluster or disperse state of nanoparticle. However, gold nanoparticle (AuNPs) emerges an ideal scaffold for sensory element in lateral flow biosensors due to their simple surface functionalization, unique optoelectronic properties and varied colour spectrum depending on morphologies and aggregation state. In this paper an effort has been made in the form of a hypothesis using in silico tools as a basis to detect polyethylene terephthalate (PET) – most abundant type of microplastic using gold nanoparticle based lateral flow biosensor. We retrieved sequences of PET-binding synthetic peptides and modelled their 3-D structure using I-Tasser server. The best protein model for each peptide sequences are docked with PET monomers – BHET, MHET and other PET polymeric ligands, to evaluate their binding affinities. The synthetic peptide SP 1 (WPAWKTHPILRM) docked with BHET and (MHET)4 exhibits 1.5-fold increases in binding affinity as compared to reference PET anchor peptide Dermaseptin SI (DSI). The GROMACS molecular dynamics simulation studies of synthetic peptide SP 1 - BHET & - (MHET)4 complexes for 50 ns further confirmed the stable binding. RMSF, RMSD, hydrogen bonds, Rg and SASA analysis provides useful structural insights of the SP 1 complexes as compared to reference DSI. Furthermore, SP 1 functionalized AuNP-based colorimetric device was described in detail for detection of PET.","Polyethylene terephthalate,Pollutants,MD simulation,Microplastic,Molecular docking,Detection,"
"climate regime shifts and biodiversity redistribution in the bay of biscay","2022","Global ocean warming, wave extreme events, and accelerating sea-level rise are challenges that coastal communities must address to anticipate damages in coming decades. The objective of this study is to undertake a time-series analysis of climate change (CC) indicators within the Bay of Biscay, including the Basque coast. We used an integrated and flexible methodology, based on Generalized Additive Mixed Models, to detect trends on 19 indicators (including marine physics, chemistry, atmosphere, hydrology, geomorphology, biodiversity, and commercial species). The results of 87 long-term time series analysed (~512,000 observations), in the last four decades, indicate four groups of climate regime shifts: 1) A gradual shift associated with CC starting in the 1980s, with a warming of the sea surface down to 100 m depth in the bay (0.10-0.25 °C per decade), increase in air temperature and insolation. This warming may have impacted on benthic community redistribution in the Basque coast, favouring warm-water species relative to cold-water species. Weight at age for anchovy and sardine decreased in the last two decades. 2) Deepening of the winter mixed layer depth in the south-eastern bay that probably led to increases in nutrients, surface oxygen, and chlorophyll concentration. Current increases on chlorophyll and zooplankton (i.e., copepods) biomass are contrary to those expected under CC scenarios in the region. 3) Sea-level rise (1.5-3.5 cm per decade since 1990s), associated with CC. 4) Increase of extreme wave height events of 16.8 cm per decade in the south-eastern bay, probably related to stormy conditions in the last decade, with impacts on beach erosion. Estimating accurate rates of sea warming, sea-level rise, extreme events, and foreseeing the future pathways of marine productivity, are key to define the best adaptation measures to minimize negative CC impacts in the region.","GAMM,Marine biodiversity,Benthos,Anchovy,Geomorphology,Sea warming,Extreme events,Basque coast,Climate change,"

"multi-reflector multi-band antennas for airborne and maritime broadband applications","2013","In all main offshore maritime activities (business, transport, yachting, etc.), the possibility to access wideband-Internet services via satellite is more and more interesting for both passenger and crew members. The same interest is increasing also for communication onboard airplanes. For some particular applications, high data rate exchange of operational information with the staff on the ground is required while, for commercial applications, satellite communications provide passengers with infotainment services (IPTV reception) as well as with broadband connectivity. The launch of new satellites generation, working in Ka-band with regional or global earth coverage, allows high throughput capacity, with an increase of the available bandwidth and a decrease of satellite connectivity costs. This reflects in a new interest for high performance mobile Ka Band antenna terminals and even more for the Ku/Ka bands reconfigurable ones. Starting from a consolidated company experience, after developing high speed trains Ku/Ka bands Satcom products, a new fully mechanical antenna design, able to work both in Ku and Ka-band, is outlined here below. The main technical aspects of a multi-reflector antenna, working in Ku and Ka frequency bands, will be analyzed even considering the different design guidelines for two selected field of applications.

"a general orthogonal transform aided mimo design for reliable maritime visible light communications","2020","In maritime visible light communication (VLC) systems, user information is delivered among different terminals distributed in the atmosphere, and the underwater environment. To combat the complex and variant marine channel conditions induced by the absorption, scattering, and turbulence influence, in this article, we propose a general orthogonal transform (OT) aided multiple input multiple output (MIMO) transmission scheme to enhance the transmission reliability performances. In our design, we propose to construct the orthogonal transform matrix recursively with the Hadamard matrix. Thus we could exploit the repetitive property of the elements in the orthogonal matrix to enlarge the Euclidean distances among the signals. Moreover, the value of the elements could be adjusted dynamically to adapt to time-changing channel conditions. Thanks to the orthogonality of the matrix, and the singular value decomposition (SVD), the interferences among signals could be effectively suppressed. Accordingly, the reliability performances can be improved. Furthermore, we derive the theoretical symbol error rate (SER) expressions for the proposed design. Numerical simulations are performed to validate the theoretical analysis. Furthermore, the SER performances with different water types, and wind speeds in various scenarios of the atmosphere, underwater, and air-water interface channels are investigated, and compared with the counterpart systems.","telecommunication network reliability,multiple input multiple output transmission scheme,underwater environment,Reliability engineering,user information,transmission reliability performances,Visible light communication,maritime visible light communication systems,matrix algebra,singular value decomposition,variant marine channel conditions,reliability,multiple input multiple output,Matrix decomposition,turbulence influence,free-space optical communication,Scattering,orthogonal transform aided MIMO design,Reliability theory,error statistics,Euclidean distances,orthogonal transform matrix,maritime visible light communication,wireless channels,symbol error rate expressions,reliable maritime visible light communications,SER performances,Hadamard matrix,marine communication,complex marine channel conditions,orthogonal transform,Air and underwater channels,MIMO communication,Transforms,air-water interface channels,"
"interannual variations and trends in remotely sensed pm2.5 along the maritime silk road from 2000 to 2014","2018","As the World Health Organization (WHO) has reported, air pollution both indoor and outdoor caused nearly 7 million deaths in 2012. Due to the rapid process urbanization and industrialization, air pollution in the form of fine particle matter continues to be a severe environmental problem in large cities in China. In particular, PM2.5 refers to aerosol particles smaller than 2.5 Î¼m in diameter that are suspended in the air. According to previous studies, human exposure to PM2.5 can cause development of various respiratory and cardiopulmonary diseases. Thus, quantifying human exposure to PM2.5 is necessary for public health risk assessment. Satellite remote sensing has proved to be a cost-effective tool for PM2.5 concentration estimation. In our study, the ground-level fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentration dataset with a spatial resolution of 1 km was used to analyze spatial temporal variations of PM2.5 concentration from 2000 to 2014 along the Maritime Silk Road. The inter-annual changing trends of PM2.5 in 12 large urban agglomerations along the Maritime Silk Road were investigated in detail. The urban agglomerations including Dhaka, Kolkata and Mumbai have experienced the most rapid increase of PM2.5 concentration with the average annual rates of 1.08 ug/m3, 1.44 ug/m3 and 0.79 ug/m3, respectively from 2000 to 2014. The areal extent of PM2.5 concentration over 35 ug/m3 increased from 15.2% in 2000 to 64.5% in 2014 in the large urban agglomerations. These findings can provide useful information for reducing human risk to air pollution and promote sustainable urban development in China and countries along the Maritime Silk Road.","public health risk assessment,Remote sensing,Urban areas,sustainable development,Mumbai,Kolkata,ground-level fine particulate matter,Maritime Silk Road,urban agglomerations,Graphical models,China,fine particle matter,AD 2000 to 2014,Air pollution,World Health Organization,satellite remote sensing,urban areas,Roads,Sustainable development,air pollution,India,Market research,PM2.5,PM2.5 concentration estimation,Dhaka,sustainable urban development,aerosols,aerosol particle,human exposure,"
"insights and guidance for offshore co2 storage monitoring based on the qics, eti mmv, and stemm-ccs projects","2020","Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is a collective term for technologies that allow society to unlock the benefits of energy intensive processes like fertiliser production and combustion of fuels (fossil or biologically sourced) without releasing the CO2 to the atmosphere. Hence, CCS could assist in accelerating decarbonisation while society pursues a just energy transition. This paper aims to summarise the learnings of three research projects that all investigated aspects of marine monitoring for CCS from a CO2 storage operator’s perspective. The QICS (Quantifying and Monitoring Potential Ecosystem Impacts of Geological Carbon Storage), ETI MMV (Energy Technologies Institute Measurement, Monitoring and Verification of CO2 Storage), and STEMM-CCS (Strategies for Environmental Monitoring of Marine CCS) projects collectively represent over twelve years of dedicated research to assess environmental impacts and to develop technologies for detection, location, and quantification of potential leakage from offshore geological storage of CO2. Each project used controlled releases in representative environments to test their methods and technologies. QICS as the first of the three projects, focused on the understanding of sensitivities of the UK marine environment to a potential leak from a CO2 storage complex and tested technologies to detect such emissions. The ETI MMV project brought together research and industry partners to develop and sea trial an operational, integrated and cost-effective marine monitoring system for geological CO2 storage. As a commercial project, these results have never been published before and this paper shares for the first-time insights from this work. In February 2020, STEMM-CCS, completed its quest to test techniques for environmental monitoring over a marine CO2 storage site in the UK North Sea, further improved near seabed leakage characterisation capabilities, and delivered a first marine CCS demonstration level ecological baseline. This paper aims to summarise some of the key insights from the three projects and provides references where available for the interested reader. The key finding of all three projects is that the impacts of small to medium CO2 leakages from large-scale storage are limited and localised. Technology capabilities exist for integrated marine CO2 storage monitoring and their performance has been benchmarked at controlled release trials. Even small leakages of 10−50 L/min can be detected at unknown locations in a large area of interest. Finally, the first important steps towards automated monitoring data analysis have been made, including automated leakage signal detection from Side Scan Sonar data (ETI MMV project) and automated species identification from marine biology images (STEMM-CCS project). Some remaining challenges include missed/false alerts because of large variations in the background signal, the cost of monitoring large areas over long periods, and making real-time decisions based on big data. Continued work to reduce the cost of marine monitoring technologies and advancing automation of data processing and analysis will be important in order to support safe and efficient offshore CCS deployment at large scale.","CCS,Location,Offshore CO2 storage,Regulation,Impact assessment,Quantification,Monitoring,Verification,Detection,Attribution,"

"exploring ais data for intelligent maritime routes extraction","2020","Maritime traffic route is the basis for the analysis of ship traffic characteristics and navigation safety. However, the spatial freedom of ship navigation makes the extraction of maritime traffic route a challenging task. In order to realize the extraction of ship traffic routes at sea, a maritime route extraction method based on ship history automatic identification system (AIS) data is proposed. In this method, the ship trajectory with rich position information is transformed into a ship trip semantic object (STSO) with semantic information, and each ship trip is abstracted as a “stop-waypoint-stop” trip object. In addition, based on the graph theory, the STSO is further integrated into the nodes and edges of a directed maritime traffic graph to realize the extraction and expression of the shipping routes. In order to prove the effectiveness of this method, the real-world AIS historical data are used for testing, and the results show that this method can effectively extract maritime traffic routes.","Automatic Identification System (AIS),Semantic trajectory,Shipping route,Maritime traffic,Graph theory,"

Based on this estimation, the control system of the water cannon would automatically achieve the strike mission. For a universal usage, a monocular image depth estimation method based on SC-SfMLearner is used, which first estimates the depth information of the image from one sample of the real-time video frames and then uses a polynomial fitting model to transfer a depth map into the physical distance in the real world. The experimental results show that the mean square deviation of the predicted distance results in the practical environment for shore-side water targets is between 0.02 and 0.03, and the accuracy rate is above 95 %, which is a good prediction and effectively addresses the accuracy of striking water targets in practical applications.","physical distance,control system,intelligent water cannon,strike mission,Prediction algorithms,distance measurement,Streaming media,polynomial fitting model,shore-side water targets,depth information,polynomials,computer vision,Maritime targets,depth map,maritime surface targets,Time series analysis,Adaptation models,SC-SfMLearner,Single image,monocular image depth estimation method,Depth estimation,striking water targets,Computational modeling,Fitting,strike angle,Estimation,real-time video frames,strike target,Polynomial model,"

"flexible data integrity checking with original data recovery in iot-enabled maritime transportation systems","2023","Internet of things (IoT) has emerged as a promising technology that can be widely used in various industries to realize real-time information collection, so as to improve production efficiency and reduce running costs. By combining the technology of IoT, maritime transportation systems (MTS) can prevent vessels collision, improve the efficiency of maritime transportation and reduce the loss of revenue for ports and shipbuilders. The large amount of real-time data generated in IoT-enabled MTS can be efficiently utilized to predict the future trajectories and hotspots of vessels on the sea combined with historical data. However, the maritime traffic data in MTS cannot be effectively processed in traditional big data analysis methods, and the integrity of it needs to be checked before being used to achieve the prediction of trajectories and high-density areas of vessels. In this paper, we propose a flexible data integrity checking scheme with original data recovery in IoT-enabled MTS. In the proposed scheme, the data blocks of vessels are encoded based on the technology of erasure coding. To ensure the availability of the historical data, the existence and the integrity of the data elements stored in the cloud can be checked. Moreover, the original data blocks can be recovered efficiently if the encoded data elements have been corrupted or deleted. Security analysis demonstrates that the proposed scheme can be proved to be correct and is secure against malicious attacks. Performance analysis shows that our scheme is more efficient than the previous schemes.","data recovery,encoded data elements,data integrity,maritime traffic data,maritime transportation systems,historical data,Internet of Things,transportation,production efficiency,integrity checking,blockchains,vessels collision,data analysis,original data recovery,future trajectories,marine safety,original data blocks,real-time data,real-time information collection,Data integrity,Real-time systems,Memory,Big Data,IoT-enabled MTS,Trajectory,Cloud computing,flexible data integrity checking scheme,Security,data integration,IoT-enabled maritime transportation systems,traditional big data analysis methods,"
"a contextual hybrid model for vessel movement prediction","2021","Predicting the movement of the vessels can significantly improve the management of safety. While the movement can be a function of geographic contexts, the current systems and methods rarely incorporate contextual information into the analysis. This paper initially proposes a novel context-aware trajectoriesâ€™ simplification method to embed the effects of geographic context which guarantees the logical consistency of the compressed trajectories, and further suggests a hybrid method that is built upon a curvilinear model and deep neural networks. The proposed method employs contextual information to check the logical consistency of the curvilinear method and then, constructs a Context-aware Long Short-Term Memory (CLSTM) network that can take into account contextual variables, such as the vessel types. The proposed method can enhance the prediction accuracy while maintaining the logical consistency, through a recursive feedback loop. The implementations of the proposed approach on the Automatic Identification System (AIS) dataset, from the eastern coast of the United States of America which was collected, from November to December 2017, demonstrates the effectiveness and better compression, i.e. 80% compression ratio while maintaining the logical consistency. The estimated compressed trajectories are 23% more similar to their original trajectories compared to currently used simplification methods. Furthermore, the overall accuracy of the implemented hybrid method is 15.68% higher than the ordinary Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network which is currently used by various maritime systems and applications, including collision avoidance, vessel route planning, and anomaly detection systems.","recurrent neural nets,Safety,deep learning (artificial intelligence),Mathematical model,safety management,movement prediction,AIS dataset,Predictive models,curvilinear method,ubiquitous computing,deep neural networks,CLSTM network,ship behavior,deep learning,ships,automatic identification system dataset,marine safety,marine engineering,Data models,contextual hybrid model,contextual information,vessel movement prediction,United States of America,geographic context,data compression,Automatic identification system,vessel types,Trajectory,compressed trajectory estimation,context-aware LSTM network,vessel route planning,Deep learning,Context modeling,context-aware long short-term memory network,logical consistency,context-aware trajectories simplification,"

"potential hot spots contaminated with exogenous, rare earth elements originating from e-waste dismantling and recycling","2022","Dismantling and recycling e-waste has been recognized as a potential emission source of rare earth elements (REEs). However, the presence of REEs in typical regional soils has yet to be studied. Given the potential health implications of such soil contamination, it is vital to study the characteristics, spatial distribution, and pollution level of REEs caused by e-waste dismantling as well as determine the influencing mechanism. This study focused on Guiyu Town as an example site, which is a typical e-waste dismantling base. From the site, 39 topsoil samples of different types were collected according to grid distribution points. Soil profiles were also collected in the dismantling and non-dismantling areas. The REE characteristic parameters showed that the REE distribution was abnormal and was affected by multiple factors. The results of the integrated pollution index showed that approximately 61.5% of soil samples were considered to be lightly polluted. Spatial distribution and correlation analysis showed that hot spots of REE-polluted soil coincided with known, main pollution sources. Moreover, there was a significant negative correlation (p ≤0.05) between the REE concentration and the distance from the pollution source. E-waste disassembly and recycling greatly affect the physical and chemical properties of the surrounding soil as well as downward migration areas. In the disassembly area, REE accumulated more easily in the surface layer (0–20 cm). Geographical detector results showed that distance factor was the main contribution factor for both light rare earth elements (LREE) and heavy rare earth element (HREE) (q = 34.59% and 53.33%, respectively). REE distribution in soil was nonlinear enhanced by different factors. Taken together, these results showed that e-waste disassembling and recycling not only directly affected the spatial distribution of REEs, but that their distribution was also affected by land use type and soil properties.","Influencing mechanism,Hot spot,E-waste,Anthropogenic REE,Factor contribution,"
"basin-wide responses of the south china sea environment to super typhoon mangkhut (2018)","2020","Relative to the open Northwest Pacific, the basin-scale South China Sea (SCS) is smaller and semi-enclosed, and the impacts of frequent super typhoons on the entire SCS basin have yet to be fully understood. Using multi-satellite observations and reanalysis data, this study explored biophysical responses of the upper ocean of the SCS induced by a typical super typhoon, Mangkhut (2018), and their regional differences with potential mechanisms. There were three different significant-response regions in the whole SCS, as follows: (1) In the ocean area around the typhoon path, strong vertical mixing, upwelling and cooling were induced, resulting in the surface chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentration enhancing markedly (three-fold). Particularly, asymmetric distribution of typhoon rainfall induced asymmetric sea surface salinity change over along the path the nearshore. Diurnal peak of chl-a concentration increased obviously, and the daily growth rate of chl-a sped up considerably in non-shore areas after Mangkhut's passage. (2) In the Beibu Gulf (BBG), the peripheral winds of Mangkhut caused a change in direction of the sea surface flow field, transporting the high-temperature and high-salinity surface seawater from the southeastern area to the BBG. This induced dramatic increases in sea surface temperature, salinity and height, and a decrease in chl-a, in most areas of BBG. (3) In the southwest SCS, the southwest monsoon–induced eastward offshore upwelling jet was weakened by the opposite large-scale peripheral wind vector of Mangkhut and gradually disappeared, resulting in accumulation and enhancement of chl-a in the nearshore. In addition, Mangkhut peripheral winds also intensified (weakened), shifting the cold (warm) eddy to the north (south) and blocking the horizontal eastward transport belt of the high-concentration chl-a. In general, our present work sheds light on the new evidence that a supper typhoon can cause basin-wide anomalies in the SCS, which has broad implications for marine biophysical environment.","Chlorophyll-a bloom,Multi-satellite remote sensing,Super typhoon Mangkhut,South China Sea,Sea surface cooling,"

The results show that the log-distance model agrees well with the general trend of the measured data, whereas the PEM has a better ability to capture the variations of the interference nulls. In addition, the free space model and the two-ray model have larger deviation from the empirical data, implying that they are not suitable for the desired scenario. For small-scale fading, various distributions are considered to fit the fading. Based on the criteria of Kolmogorovâ€“Smirnov statistics, the Rician distribution has the best goodness of fit, compared with the Rayleigh, Nakagami-m, Welbull, or lognormal distributions.

The involved experts assessed five criteria in terms of their significance: the availability of data on navigation on the selected section of the waterway, the availability of electronic navigation charts, the availability of hydrometeorological information, the availability of technical means of communication and navigational fencing. As a continuation of the research, it is proposed to study many qualitative and quantitative characteristics of both the area of the water area and the specialized equipment installed on it, since the operation of autonomous ships requires a more complex technical and information infrastructure.","knowledge of the water area,vessel traffic monitoring,DBSCAN,Autonomous navigation,maritime waterways,ships position clustering,automatic identification system,water transport system,expert system,"
"meteotsunamis at the río de la plata estuary","2022","A recent numerical study showed that low-amplitude meteotsunamis could be detected at the Río de la Plata (RDP) estuary. In this work, eight sea level series (one year long, 2018) were analyzed: six measured within the RDP estuary and two at the adjacent continental shelf. All meteotsunami events during 2018 were identified and analyzed at the RDP estuary, and the maximum wave height observed was 0.78 m. The atmospheric conditions during the analyzed events were investigated, showing that the presence of atmospheric cold fronts and atmospheric gravity waves seem to happen simultaneously with meteotsunami events. From sea-level observations gathered at the estuary it was inferred that the meteotsunamis could be driven by atmospheric forcings propagating (i) mainly from SE to NW (the meteotsunami would be driven along the estuary from the outer to the upper RDP, and the Proudman resonance mechanism could explain its amplification), (ii) predominantly from SW to NE (the meteotsunami would be simultaneously generated at different locations of the RDP estuary), or (iii) the meteotsunami could be generated in waters of the continental shelf, to get into the RDP estuary, and then freely propagates from the outer to the upper RDP (in this case the Proudman resonance mechanism would not explain the amplification within the estuary). It is important to mention that the results of the present investigation are biased to the high-period band of meteotsunamis because the sampling interval (20 min, for most locations) is rather large to allow the study of the whole meteotsunami frequency band.","Río de la Plata (RPD) estuary,Proudman resonance,Meteorological tsunami,Atmospheric cold fronts,Atmospheric gravity waves,"
"a new detection method for ldos attacks based on data mining","2022","The serving capabilities of networks are reduced by low-rate denial of service (LDoS) attacks that periodically send high-intensity pulse data flows. This type of attack shows a harmful effect similar to that of traditional DoS attacks, but their attack modes differ greatly. The high concealment of LDoS attacks makes it extremely difficult for traditional DoS detection methods to detect LDoS attacks. Meanwhile, the state-of-art detection methods for LDoS attacks have low-efficiency and resource-intensive and time complexity issues. We propose a novel detection method with analysis of abnormal network traffic under LDoS attacks that combines data mining technology. The judgement benchmarks were also established. The results from the experimental simulation on the simulated environment, physical environment and public datasets prove that the developed method can effectively detect LDoS attacks with optimal detection cost and low complexity, and has a high accuracy, a low false-negative rate, and a low false-positive rate.","Low-rate denial of service (LDoS),Histogram,Frequency distribution,Abnormal traffic,Adaptive exponentially weighted moving average (AEWMA) control chart,Data mining,"

"leveraging graph and deep learning uncertainties to detect anomalous maritime trajectories","2022","Understanding and representing traffic patterns are key to detecting anomalous trajectories in the transportation domain. However, some trajectories can exhibit heterogeneous maneuvering characteristics despite confining to normal patterns. Thus, we propose a novel graph-based trajectory representation and association scheme for extraction and confederation of traffic movement patterns, such that data patterns and uncertainty can be learned by deep learning (DL) models. This paper proposes the usage of a recurrent neural network (RNN)-based evidential regression model, which can predict trajectory at future timesteps as well as estimate the data and model uncertainties associated, to detect anomalous maritime trajectories, such as unusual vessel maneuvering, using automatic identification system (AIS) data. Furthermore, we utilize evidential deep learning classifiers to detect unusual turns of vessels and the loss of transmitted signal using predicted class probabilities with associated uncertainties. Our experimental results suggest that the graphical representation of traffic patterns improves the ability of the DL models, such as evidential and Monte Carlo dropout, to learn the temporal-spatial correlation of data and associated uncertainties. Using different datasets and experiments, we demonstrate that the estimated prediction uncertainty yields fundamental information for the detection of traffic anomalies in the maritime and, possibly in other domains.","Monte Carlo methods,classification,recurrent neural nets,graph,deep learning (artificial intelligence),Anomaly detection,DL models,graph-based trajectory representation,automatic identification system data,Monte Carlo dropout,graphical representation,traffic movement patterns,detect anomalous maritime trajectories,Predictive models,regression analysis,evidential deep learning,marine engineering,Data models,data patterns,pattern classification,Artificial intelligence,graph theory,RNN,regression,clustering,uncertainty,Trajectory,Uncertainty,probability,Computational modeling,traffic engineering computing,recurrent neural network-based evidential regression model,deep learning uncertainties,AIS data,"

This mechanism uses a sliding window to generate fixed data input, uses graph attention network to capture the dependence between ship behavior characteristics, and determines the threshold of anomaly according to the sea environment set in this paper.

"learning ship activity patterns in maritime data streams: enhancing cep rule learning by temporal and spatial relations and domain-specific functions","2023","Maritime surveillance systems are of particular importance for the smooth and safe operation of maritime traffic. Such systems must efficiently analyze the continuous stream of incoming ship movement data to provide an up-to-date picture of the situation at sea. Complex Event Processing (CEP) is a software technology dedicated to the analysis of data streams in real time and seems to be promising for maritime surveillance as well. CEP is based on rules that usually have to be formulated manually by domain experts. Recently, several approaches of learning CEP rules have been proposed. However, all these approaches are limited to standard CEP rule languages which are not well suited for describing maritime situations. In this paper, we extend Bat4CEP, an innovative bat-inspired approach to automatic CEP rule learning, to meet the specific needs of the maritime domain. In particular, we extend the rule language of Bat4CEP to include temporal-spatial operators and domain-specific functions. This extended rule language makes it possible to express complex maritime facts in a simple and understandable form. Furthermore, it is shown how the proposed rule language extensions can be integrated into the Bat4CEP learning approach. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated through extensive experiments with real maritime data streams.","Seaports,metaheuristics,Metaheuristics,Standards,Artificial intelligence,Maritime transportation,Surveillance,interpretable AI,Real-time systems,complex event processing,Marine vehicles,maritime data analytics,machine learning,"
"coarse-to-fine luminance estimation for low-light image enhancement in maritime video surveillance","2019","Captured images in maritime video surveillance under non-uniform illumination conditions easily suffer from low contrast and details loss. The low-quality images may significantly result in negative effects in practical applications, e.g., target detection, recognition, classification and tracking, etc. Increasing attention has recently been paid to improve the quality of low-light images via computer vision techniques. In this paper, we propose to establish a two-step luminance estimation framework to enhance low-light images. In particular, the coarse luminance is firstly estimated using traditional Max-RGB which extracts the highest pixel values in each color channel. The refined luminance is obtained by introducing a weighted variational model which has the capacities of structure-preserving and texture-smoothing. Based on the estimated well-constructed luminance, the enhanced low-light images are obtained by combining Retinex model with its extended version. The image quality is further improved through a BM3D-based denoising approach. Experimental results on both synthetic and realistic low-light images have demonstrated the satisfactory imaging performance in termsP of quantitative and qualitative evaluations.","Image enhancement,image denoising,Image restoration,Lighting,BM3D-based denoising approach,image enhancement,weighted variational model,Image color analysis,low-quality images,max-RGB,image colour analysis,Atmospheric modeling,retinex model,marine engineering,brightness,computer vision,object detection,image texture,synthetic low-light images,image reconstruction,color channel,image quality,realistic low-light images,low-light image enhancement,two-step luminance estimation framework,details loss,video surveillance,coarse-to-fine luminance estimation,Estimation,Channel estimation,maritime video surveillance,"
"reconstructing holocene glacier activity at langfjordjøkelen, arctic norway, using multi-proxy fingerprinting of distal glacier-fed lake sediments","2015","Late Glacial and Holocene glacier fluctuations are important indicators of climate variability in the northern polar region and contain knowledge vital to understanding and predicting present and future climate changes. However, there still is a lack of robustly dated terrestrial climate records from Arctic Norway. Here, we present a high-resolution relative glacier activity record covering the past ∼10,000 cal. a BP from the northern outlet of the Langfjordjøkelen ice cap in Arctic Norway. This record is reconstructed from detailed geomorphic mapping, multi-proxy sedimentary fingerprinting and analyses of distal glacier-fed lake sediments. We used Principal Component Analysis to characterize sediments of glacial origin and trace them in a chain of downstream lakes. Of the variability in the sediment record of the uppermost Lake Jøkelvatnet, 73% can be explained by the first Principal Component axis and tied directly to upstream glacier erosion, whereas the glacial signal becomes weaker in the more distal Lakes Store Rundvatnet and Storvatnet. Magnetic susceptibility and titanium count rates were found to be the most suitable indicators of Holocene glacier activity in the distal glacier-fed lakes. The complete deglaciation of the valley of Sør-Tverrfjorddalen occurred ∼10,000 cal. a BP, followed by a reduced or absent glacier during the Holocene Thermal Optimum. The Langfjordjøkelen ice cap reformed with the onset of the Neoglacial ∼4100 cal. a BP, and the gradually increasing glacier activity culminated at the end of the Little Ice Age in the early 20th century. Over the past 2000 cal. a BP, the record reflects frequent high-amplitude glacier fluctuations. Periods of reduced glacier activity were centered around 1880, 1600, 1250 and 950 cal. a BP, while intervals of increased glacier activity occurred around 1680, 1090, 440 and 25 cal. a BP. The large-scale Holocene glacier activity of the Langfjordjøkelen ice cap is consistent with regional temperature proxy reconstructions and glacier variability across Norway. Long-term changes in the extent of the northern outlet of the Langfjordjøkelen ice cap largely followed trends in regional summer temperatures, whereas winter season atmospheric variability may have triggered decadal-scale glacial fluctuations and generally affected the amplitude of glacier events.","Lake sediments,Late Glacial,Glaciers,Langfjordjøkelen,PCA,Holocene glacier activity,Arctic Norway,"

A streamlined semi-automatic approach to processing the data is finally outlined, which can be used to prepare a dataset for ship performance analysis. Typical data processing steps like interpolating metocean data, deriving additional features, estimating resistance components, data cleaning, and outlier detection are arranged in the best possible manner not only to streamline the data processing but also to obtain reliable results.

"an enhanced intelligent model: to protect marine iot sensor environment using ensemble machine learning approach","2021","The research in marine sensors and the Internet of Things (IoT) has grown exponentially with the ample warehouse of natural materials in the sea. The growing activities in the marine sensor environment increased the threat of anomalies and cyber-attacks. Many Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and classical machine learning-based models have been proposed to secure the sensor-based IoT infrastructure. Still, these mechanisms have failed to achieve significant results for securing the marine sensor environment due to the discriminant requirements of the IoT appliances in deep oceans, such as distribution, information complexity, scalability, higher network bandwidth requirements, and low computational capacity. Hence, we propose a lightweight and robust ensemble model to secure the marine IoT environment from cyber-attacks and malicious activities. This paper established an optimized Light Gradient Boosting Machine (Light-GBM) algorithm for ocean IoT attack detection. The experiments were conducted on Distributed Smart Space Orchestration System (DS2OS) dataset. The proposed methodology includes a label encoding technique for best feature selection, hyper-parameter tuning, ensemble function, and a novel algorithm to develop an ocean IoT attack detection model. As an extension of traditional methods, the optimized Light-GBM model can handle the distributed IoT attacks in the deeper marine environments with low computational cost and with 98.52% detection accuracy. The comparative analysis confirms the effectiveness of the proposed model for marine sensor safety. Conclusively, the proposed model mitigates the threat of cyber-attacks in the marine sensor environment and presenting a promising future in real-time ocean-based IoT applications.","Marine data safety,Sensor-based infrastructure,Light-GBM,Internet of things (IoT),Machine learning,Ensemble-learning,"

"maritime visible image classification based on double transfer method","2020","Image classification using deep transfer learning has received significant attention, benefiting from pre-trained with the large-scale annotation dataset and continuous improvement of neural network structure. In contrast to universal image classification, however, few publicly available datasets of maritime environments utilize deep transfer learning. Due to data-gathering effort and computational cost, the maritime datasets are deficient in the method of merging datasets and the benchmark of few-shot dataset classifiers. In this article, we proposed the double transfer method, consisting of the merging datasets network and the backbone network, to address the problem. The merging datasets network measuring image similarity separates classes of known and unknown samples to reorganize a dataset, and the backbone network is constructed from the model EfficientNet-b5 by network-based deep transfer learning.

"analysis of human factors affecting seafarersâ€™ cognitive load on maritime safety","2023","For the shipping industry with a large number of seafarers, human factor is the key to the shipping safety. However, the current research on human error identification of maritime accidents and seafarersâ€™ management neglects the influence of the relationship between human cognitive load and safety behavior. It is of great significance to the safety monitoring and management of the seafarers on duty. Therefore, from the perspective of ensuring the safety management of maritime transportation, this paper analyzes the factors that affect the cognitive load of seafarers from three aspects: individual factors, environmental factors, ship and shore organization. The data of cognitive load and its influencing factors of 987 inland river seafarers are collected by questionnaire survey, and the relationship between the influencing factors and cognitive load is reflected by logistic regression model. The results show that the formation of seafarersâ€™ cognitive load is multi-dimensional, mainly affected by family care, fatigue, psychological condition, mount guard emotion, ship environment and overtime work. Subsequent studies on the cognitive load and workload of seafarers should consider physiological and psychological conditions, task difficulty, navigation environment and other multi-dimensional conditions. The findings provide theoretical basis for maritime seafarersâ€™ safety management, such as safety risk monitoring, recruitment and selection process, and training for certification of seafarer competency. It has reference value to improve the ability of seafarer behavior correction and ensure the navigation safety of ships.","human factors,Psychology,Human factors,Transportation,Safety management,Navigation,Cognitive load,seafarer,Industries,maritime safety,cognitive load,"
"characterizing the eemian-weichselian transition in northwestern europe with three multiproxy speleothem archives from the belgian han-sur-lesse and remouchamps cave systems","2019","Interglacial to glacial transitions represent the most drastic turnovers in the Quaternary climate system. Yet, millennial-scaled climate variability and stochastic internal variability that result in (inter)glacial transitions remain poorly understood. Here, three speleothems from two different cave systems in Belgium are investigated to characterize the Eemian to early Weichselian transition. The speleothems show high reproducibility for δ13C, interpreted as a proxy for past vegetation activity, controlled by type of vegetation above the cave. All three speleothems show a drastic increase in δ13C between 118 and 117 ka, reflecting a rapid change in vegetation from last interglacial temperate tree species towards glacial open-grass vegetation. This transition shows a strong affinity with the Late Eemian Aridity Pulse (LEAP) at 118 ± 1 ka, previously identified in pollen records from Western Germany. An age of 117.7 ± 0.5 ka is determined for the start of this transition in the Belgian speleothems. The speleothem records show a distinct transition in the proxies between Eemian optimum conditions and increased variability during the glacial inception and therefore the Eemian-Weichselian transition is set at 117.7 ± 0.5 ka in the speleothem records. High-resolution trace element analysis shows that the transition is initiated by a cooling pulse followed by a decrease in precipitation. Through comparison with other archives, including North-Atlantic sedimentary records, it is proposed that the transition at 117.7 ka constitutes an internal climate response caused by a substantial input of freshwater from degraded ice-sheets by the end of the Eemian (∼120-118 ka).","Western Europe,Stable isotopes,Speleothems,Interglacial(s),Paleoclimatology,Glacial inception,"
"cognitively-inspired motion pattern learning & analysis algorithms for higher-level fusion and automated scene understanding","2007","We have developed a suite of neurobiologically inspired algorithms for exploiting track data to learn normal patterns of motion behavior, detect deviations from normalcy, and predict future behavior. These capabilities contribute to higher-level fusion situational awareness and assessment objectives. They also provide essential elements for automated scene understanding to shift operator focus from sensor monitoring and activity detection to assessment and response. Our learning algorithms learn behavioral patterns at a variety of conceptual, spatial, and temporal levels to reduce a massive amount of track data to a rich set of information regarding their field of regard that supports decision-making and timely response initiation. Continuous incremental learning enables the models of normal behavior to adapt well to evolving situations while maintaining high levels of performance. Deviations from normalcy result in reports being published directly to operator displays or to other reasoning components within a larger system. Deviation tolerance levels are user settable during system operation to tune alerting sensitivity. Operator (or other system component) responses to anomaly alerts can be fed back into the algorithms to further enhance and refine learned models. These algorithms have been successfully demonstrated to learn vessel behaviors across the maritime domain and to learn vehicle and dismount behavior in land-based settings.","Motion detection,Pattern analysis,Decision making,Algorithm design and analysis,Layout,Motion analysis,Computerized monitoring,Displays,Vehicles,Tracking,"

Besides international and domestic transport, commercial fishing is one of the main industries in Japan. Major harbors, seaways, and their surrounding areas have high traffic density, and thus the risks of marine accident are not negligible. In this paper, we look into typical cases of collision casualties in middle congested areas outside traffic controlled areas, and discuss how systems can support mariners in collision critical situations. Collision casualties are analyzed from a perspective of encountering types within the traffic environment. According to the types extracted here, cognitive process analysis is then presented. Requirements for each type of collision are also discussed.","traffic controlled areas,Marine navigation,collision critical situations,commercial fishing,Radar equipment,collision accident analysis,cognitive systems,shipping industry,collision casualties,Cognitive science,middle congested areas,maritime navigation,domestic transport,traffic density,cognitive process analysis,international transport,Decision support systems,encountering types,shipbuilding industry,"
"applications of systems thinking for resilience study in maritime transportation system of systems","2009","Maritime Transportation System (MTS) is a critical infrastructure system that enables economic activity through transferring goods between national and international destinations. This research is an effort to define and view MTS as a System of Systems (SoS) and apply Systems Thinking to understand, engineer, analyze, and govern it in a more effective and efficient way. We define Maritime Transportation System of Systems (MTSoS) as an integration of interdependent constituent systems and apply systemic tools such as Systemigrams to study critical properties of the system such as resilience and security through understanding its systemic interrelationships more effectively. A variety of systems engineering models have been applied to MTS. However, it is necessary to form a structured approach and develop new systemic toolsets that enables the stakeholders to view interdependencies and interconnections among the constituent systems of MTSoS.","system of systems,Transportation,Systems Thinking,economic activity,transportation,Resilience,Systemigrams,systems engineering,systems thinking,Technology management,Systems engineering and theory,Maritime Transportation System of Systems,marine systems,critical infrastructure system,marine engineering,Oceans,Collaboration,international destinations,USA Councils,interdependent constituent systems,Context-aware services,Security,Terrorism,maritime transportation system,"
"electrical generators for maritime application","2011","This paper presents feasible options for generators in flywheel of diesel engine for small maritime application. An outer rotor permanent magnet (PM) machine with concentrated windings is preferred for this application since it has good integration in a flywheel, higher power density and efficiency than electrically excited synchronous generators, induction generators, etc. A nonlinear transient finite-element-method (FEM) model is developed to calculate iron losses. Afterwards, the model is used for optimal design of a neodymium PM generator improved in terms of power density. Magnet thickness of redesigned generator is only 2 mm, so it has less possibility to break during maintenance. The FEM model is validated by experiment. Results show good agreement.","Generators,maritime application,nonlinear transient finite element method,diesel engine,power density,permanent magnet machine,electrical generators,rotors,magnet thickness,flywheel,finite element analysis,transient FEM,permanent magnet machines,electrically excited synchronous generators,Diesel engines,concentrated windings,Generator system,Magnetic flux,Iron,diesel engines,Windings,Rotors,Finite element methods,iron loss,marine application,"
"unsupervised extraction of knowledge from s-ais data for maritime situational awareness","2013","Automatic vessel behaviour analysis is a key factor for maritime surveillance and relies on an efficient representation of knowledge about vessels activity. Emerging technologies such as space-based AIS provides a new dimension of service and creates a need for new methods able to learn a maritime scene model at an oceanic scale.

"demurrage pattern analysis using logical analysis of data: a case study of the ulsan port authority","2022","Maritime logistics, which accounts for around 80% of international trade around the world, has been a driving force for economic growth. Increases in maritime traffic, however, lead to increased congestion in berths and terminals. This congestion in turn negatively affects the total ship turnaround time and leads to decreased efficiency in port operations and a higher demurrage rate, which refers to the number of vessels in queue for more than a fixed time period waiting to load/unload out of the total number of vessels entering a port. The demurrage rate directly affects a port’s operating profits; thus, this rate needs to stay as low as possible. In this study, we focus on developing a methodology to address the demurrage rate of a port. To this end, we first collect two sets of vessel data (2016 annual data for training and 2019 annual data for validating) for ships entering and leaving the Port of Ulsan in the Republic of Korea and integrate these datasets with berth data and weather data. We tailor the logical analysis of data (LAD) technique to derive the patterns from the training data that mitigate or aggravate the demurrage rate. We use these patterns to predict the demurrage rate for the validating set of data. The overall binary classification results demonstrate the proposed LAD technique’s competitive performance, compared with other state-of-the-art machine learning methods. We then analyze the patterns to derive policy suggestions that can lower the demurrage rate at the Port of Ulsan. Our computational experiments find that the availability of tugs or pilots and port arrival times mainly affect the demurrage rate at the Port of Ulsan. Finally, our study showcases new possibilities for using patterns of demurrage and non-demurrage vessels obtained by LAD to help policymakers and port operators address the growing demurrage problem.","Maritime logistics,Maritime traffic data,Logical analysis of data,Port congestion,Demurrage rate,"
"shelf-wide analyses of sand wave migration using gis: a case study on the netherlands continental shelf","2023","Shelf seas often display rhythmic bedforms, of which tidal sand waves are the most relevant to study from an engineering point of view due to their dimensions and dynamic nature. Environmental conditions such as water depth, flow velocities and grain size vary across entire shelf regions, consequently influencing the characteristics of tidal sand waves, including migration rates. However, as opposed to site-specific analyses, shelf sea-wide analyses on sand wave migration are scarce. Through the use of timeseries of bathymetric data, we investigate the spatial variability of sand wave migration on the scale of the Netherlands Continental Shelf (NCS). Two existing data-driven techniques, Pairs of Source and Target Points (PSTP) and Spatial Cross Correlation (SCC), were implemented in a Geographic Information System (GIS). Through testing at four sites on the NCS, PSTP was deemed the preferred technique for a shelf-wide analysis and was hence used to quantify the NCS-wide migration rates and directions. To illustrate the spatial variability, the quantified migration rates and directions were averaged per km2. For the NCS in general, migration to the south-west or north-east at typical rates between 0 and 3 m/year was found. The south-western region of the NCS demonstrated migration rates below 0.5 m/year with migration directions alternating over short distances. The north-eastern region exhibited uniform migration to the north-east at rates which gradually increased when in closer proximity to the Wadden Islands. Typical rates in this region were found to be between 2 and 8 m/year. The highest migration rates were observed near coastal regions and on top of sandbanks. The presence of these sandbanks strongly deflects the migration directions of superimposed sand waves at a number of locations. The analysis performed within this study demonstrates valuable insights into methods that can be used to evaluate shelf-wide regions of interest. A deeper understanding of the dynamic nature of the North Sea bed assists in optimising hydrographic re-survey policies, critical infrastructure planning and subsequent monitoring. Furthermore, this study may offer a wider set of tools that could be used for correlating sand wave migration to its governing physical mechanisms and environmental parameters.","North Sea,Data analysis,Spatial variation,Tidal sand wave migration,GIS,Netherlands Continental Shelf,"

"trajectory pattern extraction and anomaly detection for maritime vessels","2021","Trajectory analysis and extraction of trajectory patterns are crucial to enhance marine safety and marine status awareness. The major data source for such analysis is Automatic Identification System (AIS), which publishes data related to movement of the ship while cruising. AIS broadcasts information including type of ship, identity number, state, destination, estimated time of arrival (ETA), location, speed, direction, and cargo. In this paper, we focus on extracting a variety of trajectory patterns for maritime vessels. The first group of analysis we focus on is arrival port, arrival time, and next position prediction on AIS messages, which are useful to aid maritime operators. We propose three different approaches for the prediction of marine vessel movement. As the second type of analysis, anomaly detection on marine vessel trajectory is studied. For vessel movement prediction, the experiments show that the proposed solutions brought improvement against conventional supervised learning approaches. The proposed anomaly detection technique is demonstrated on a case study.","Trajectory,Maritime,LSTM,Next position prediction,Anomaly detection,Arrival port prediction,Arrival time prediction,Supervised learning,AIS,"
"improving maritime situational awareness by fusing sensor information and intelligence","2011","In present-day military security operations threats are more difficult to reveal than in conventional warfare theatres, since they take place during the course of normal life. These maritime missions often take place in littoral environments, where acts of piracy, drug trafficking and other threatening events become obscured in the crowd of everyday fisheries, cargo traders, ferries and pleasure cruises, hindering situation awareness. We aim to improve situation awareness and threat detection capabilities in maritime scenarios by combining sensor-based information with context information and intelligence from various sources. The fusion and analysis in order to reveal suspect from normal behavior is based on domain ontologies. A test bed allows the study of various exploitation and assessments techniques applied to these domain ontologies. Using an appropriate scenario we have simulated suspect and normal behaviour to test the applicability of the various techniques.","Semantics,sensor fusion,ferries,cargo traders,situation awareness,Decision support,context information,military systems,drug trafficking,Situation awareness,maritime scenarios,domain ontologies,maritime situational awareness,littoral environments,Decision trees,Bayesian methods,Intelligence,threatening events,Context,sensor-based information,warfare theatres,Ontologies,everyday fisheries,threat detection capabilities,Context modeling,Sensors,Threat assessment,maritime missions,military security operations,Security,pleasure cruises,"
"using b15 in vehicles on real on-road circumstances - a case study","2023","The transport sector is one of the largest contributors of pollutant gas emissions, being also one of the largest consumers of energy, mainly fossil origin, so it is urgent and imperative to act in this sector. The legislation on these emissions has been undergoing constant updates, increasingly incisive on this subject. The imposed reductions in pollutant gases are obvious and demanding, which also demands the use of sustainable energy sources, where biofuels appear as a viable and immediate solution. This study will provide an overview of the utilization of biodiesel in actual on-road driving conditions. The current information analyzes the evaluation of the B15 (15% biodiesel in diesel) use on automobile fleets to achieve this goal through a completely practical approach. To accomplish this goal, it was used monitoring data from car fleets that included both cars and trucks fuelled by conventional diesel and a mixture with 15% of biodiesel during comparable time periods. The 15% biodiesel addition to fuel will result in some differences in fuel consumption for all the evaluated automobile fleets, corresponding to increases or decreases of maximum of 2%, which variance is much lower that the observed between vehicles with different drivers and operation activities. Due to all the benefits a renewable fuel offers, particularly in terms of the reduction of CO2 emissions and decrease in reliance on fossil fuels, the increase in biodiesel blends can be confirmed as making a positive environmental contribution even when a small average increase in fuel consumption is verified.","Transport,CO emissions,Biodiesel,Bioenergy,Renewable fuels,Greenhouse gases,"

"complex economic consequence analysis to protect the maritime infrastructure","2022","The marine transportation system (MTS) is a critical part of the nation's supply chain. Malicious actors, natural disasters, pandemics, geo-political events and larger marine casualties such as the 2021 Suez Canal grounding incident can disrupt the MTS and domestic and global supply chains. To date, most research and contingency planning has focused on single-event disruptions such as oil spills or security issues. While supply chains may be resilient enough to cope with a wide variety of single disruptions, aggregated challenges may result in cascading failures. There has been little analysis of the impacts of multiple disruptions that build on each other in complex ways. This suggests that modeling the impact of multiple vector disruptions on multiple MTS targets can help policy makers, business leaders, and others anticipate, plan for, mitigate, and rapidly recover from future complex disruptions. This paper describes an approach to research questions like: What are plausible examples of complex, multi-vector disruptions to the MTS? What could make their outcomes more complicated and challenging than those of single disruptions? What are their consequences for different components of the MTS? What are some pre-disruption mitigations and post-disruption resilience tactics that might be useful in such cases? How can we estimate the time to implement them, the costs of implementation, and the reduction of impact of such measures? The project described is developing a framework to address such questions. The framework will be used to analyze the impact of different combinations of individual disruptions, including natural disasters and climate change; security events, including cyber, accidents and marine casualties; and social/political disruptions. The analysis will focus on the total economic consequences of these threat combinations and transition into a user-friendly decision-support tool to improve risk management.","decision support systems,marine accidents,malicious actors,disasters,maritime,supply chain management,marine transportation system,marine casualties,total economic consequences,transportation,individual disruptions,marine navigation,Climate change,2021 Suez Canal grounding incident,security of data,Stakeholders,contingency planning,single-event disruptions,future complex disruptions,politics,Supply chains,pre-disruption mitigations,post-disruption resilience tactics,Maritime communication,maritime infrastructure,oil spills,risk management,user-friendly decision-support tool,economic consequences,resilience,MTS targets,supply chain,global supply chains,natural disasters,multivector disruptions,disruptions,security events,US Department of Homeland Security,complex economic consequence analysis,geo-political events,supply chains,Time measurement,Security,multiple vector disruptions,mitigation,Marine transportation,"

"how can automatic identification system (ais) data be used for maritime spatial planning?","2018","Although the importance of Maritime Spatial Planning (MSP) as a concept is know acknowledged and the legal framework is in place, the task of applying it remains a delicate one. One of the keys to success is having pertinent data. Knowing how maritime uses unfold in a spatio-temporal context, and what conflicting or synergistic interactions exist between activities, is crucial. However, this information is especially hard to obtain in a marine environment. As a result this information has often been identified as the missing layer in information systems developed by maritime stakeholders. Since 2002, the Automatic Identification System (AIS) has been undergoing a major development. Allowing for real time geo-tracking and identification for equipped vessels, the data that issues from AIS data promises to map and describe certain marine human activities. After recapitulating the main characteristics of AIS and the data it provides, this article proposes to evaluate how AIS is currently used in MSP at a European level, and to concisely present a series of methods and results obtained within the framework of several operational research projects. The objective is to illustrate how the AIS data processing and analysis can produce adequate information for MSP: maritime traffic density, shipping lanes and navigation flows, hierarchical network of maritime routes, alleged fishing zones, spatio-temporal interactions between activities (potential conflicting uses or synergies). The conclusion looks in particular at the legal questions concerning the use of AIS.","Integrated management,Shipping lanes,Automatic Identification System (AIS),Maritime Spatial Planning (MSP),Spatio-temporal interactions,Density of maritime traffic,Sea fishing,Hierarchical network of maritime routes,"
"evaluation model of maritime search and rescue response capability","2019","Considering the problems of randomness and fuzziness in evaluating indexes from maritime search and rescue response capability system, a novel method based on subjective-objective attribute weights integrated and center normal grey cloud method was presented. Firstly, cloud theory was introduced to transform the uncertainty of factors into quantitative digital features, to achieve the qualitative indicators of quantitative processing. Secondly, the improved analytic hierarchy process(IAHP) and criteria improved through inter-criteria correlation(CRITIC) were used respectively to determine the subjective and objective weights. The comprehensive weights were thus obtained through the relative information entropy principle. Thirdly, grey cloud method was used to make the second level evaluation indexs to get the assessment of maritime search and rescue response capability. And on the basis of that, the maritime search and rescue response capability evaluation results was obtained. Finally, the model was evaluated on three ports and the results showed the IAHP-CRITIC combination weighting method can effectively integrate the subjective and objective weights information.

"response strategies of the main forest types to climatic anomalies across croatian biogeographic regions inferred from fapar remote sensing data","2014","Croatia is positioned in the transitional zone of South-eastern Europe and the Mediterranean, a region with frequent occurrence of severe droughts and dry spells, which makes it particularly vulnerable to the impact of climate change. It distends across three main European biogeographical regions – Continental, Alpine and Mediterranean – and therefore has a very high level of forest diversity comprised of 11 out of 14 European forest types. This makes it very convenient to study the exposure of main European forest types to extreme climatic events in the southern limits of their species distribution range. This study provides an assessment of responses of forest vegetation under episodes of climatic anomalies consisting of the most severe historical dry and warm spells in 2000 and 2003, together with the extremely rainy season in 2005 across Croatian territory. The question of interest in this study was to reveal how the existing forest types across the territorial gradient respond to highly expressed extreme climatic variations and to infer some clues about related adaptive strategies. The regional scale approach was applied which previously performed structural delineation of forest cover into eleven main forest groups or bioclimates and were examined considering functional differences. Responses of eleven bioclimatic types were analyzed by time series (1998–2005) of monthly FAPAR (The Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetic Active Radiation) coverage with a spatial resolution of 1.2km, freely available from JRC FAPAR project. To quantify and differentiate the vegetation response in the considered years we adopted indices of resilience (resistance, recovery, resilience and relative resilience). We also provided a modified approach by applying these indices on a seasonal scale to examine the relationship between variations of phenology and ecosystem responses. The results confirmed the modification of seasonality of photosynthetic activity in relation to the altitudinal and spatial gradient. At the intra-seasonal scale, we distinguished specific opportunistic behavior of the common beech and oak forest types to alternating climatic conditions. Beech forest types show a very high ability to shift their phenology to earlier spring warming as a consequence of global warming. However, continental and Mediterranean oak forest types and in particular Aleppo pine and holm oak forests showed a higher increase of FAPAR during rainy events. The revealed capability of some tree species to better exploit rainfall in very wet periodic episodes has to be further evaluated in drawing conclusions about the overall resilience of forests under future climate change scenarios.","Extreme climatic events,Forest resilience,Climate change impacts,Land surface phenology,Forest responses,Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR),"
"the root-zone soil moisture spectrum in a mediterranean ecosystem","2022","Storage of water within soil pores of the root zone introduce memory effects in the dynamics of soil moisture that are considerably longer than the integral timescale of many atmospheric processes. Thus, hydro-climatic states can be “sustained” through land-surface heat and water vapor fluxes primarily because they can “feed off” on this long-term soil moisture memory. Root-zone soil moisture memory is only but one feature characterizing the spectrum of soil moisture dynamics, which is analyzed here using a combination of long-term measurements and models. In particular, the spectrum of root-zone soil moisture content in a Mediterranean ecosystem is examined using 14-years of half-hourly measurements. A distinguishing hydro-climatic feature in such ecosystems is that sources (mainly rainfall) and sinks (mainly evapotranspiration) of soil moisture are roughly out of phase with each other. For over 4 decades of time scales and 7 decades of energy, the canonical shape of the measured soil moisture spectrum is shown to be approximately Lorentzian determined by the soil moisture variance and its memory but with two exceptions: the occurrences of a peak at diurnal-to-daily time scales and a weaker peak at near annual time scales. Model calculations and spectral analysis demonstrate that diurnal and seasonal variations in hydroclimate forcing responsible for variability in evapotranspiration had minor impact on the normalized shape of the soil moisture spectrum. However, their impact was captured by adjustments in the temporal variance. These findings indicate that precipitation and not evapotranspiration variability dominates the multi-scaling properties of soil moisture variability consistent with prior climate model simulations. Furthermore, the soil moisture memory inferred by the annual peak of soil moisture (340 d) is consistent with climate model simulations, while the memory evaluated from the loss function of a linearized mass balance approach leads to a smaller value (50 d), highlighting the effect of weak non-stationarity on soil moisture variability.","Lorentzian spectrum,Mediterranean ecosystems,Root zone soil moisture,Ecohydrology,"
"malicious ais spoofing and abnormal stealth deviations: a comprehensive statistical framework for maritime anomaly detection","2021","The automatic identification system (AIS) is an essential and economical equipment for collision avoidance and maritime surveillance. However, AIS can be subject to intentional reporting of false information, or â€œspoofingâ€. This article assumes the vessel trajectory nominally follows a piecewise mean-reverting process; thereby, it addresses the problem of establishing whether a vessel is reporting adulterated position information through AIS messages in order to hide its current planned route and a possible deviation from the nominal route. Multiple hypothesis testing suggests a framework to enlist reliable information from monitoring systems (coastal radars and space-born satellite sensors) in support of detection of anomalies, spoofing, and stealth deviations.

The method is tested in a specific scenario with high traffic density, the Baltic Sea. Experimental results reveal a decrease of over 99% storage data with a negligible precision drop.

"day-ahead prediction of hourly subentry energy consumption in the building sector using pattern recognition algorithms","2020","The accurate day-ahead prediction of subentry electric energy consumption (SEEC) is a critical basis for elaborative building energy management. However, most of the current studies mainly focus on modeling overall energy consumption without distinguishing its patterns of different temporal features. At the same time, advances in metering technologies and machine learning methods provide new opportunities for detailed predictions. In this paper, a day-ahead prediction model based on the improved recognized patterns via fuzzy C-means clustering and nonlinear regression is proposed and discussed. The proposed indirect pattern recognition is carried out by taking advantage of the connotative incidence relation between fluctuation features and influencing factors. Considering the different temporal characteristics of hourly SEEC, this proposed model is applied in an office building with the scope to manage the day-ahead prediction of hourly HVAC subentry and hourly socket subentry. These are taken as the typical non-stationary sequence and typical stationary sequence respectively. Results show that the proposed pattern recognition is applicable for the non-stationary HVAC subentry, and a stable energy pattern can contribute to accurate predictions. Furthermore, the introduction of additional hourly meteorological parameters improves the accuracy via rolling prediction instead. Finally, the modeling adaptability and applicable implications are summarized for references of optimal building energy operation.","Subentry electric energy consumption,Pattern recognition,Office building,Energy prediction,Adaptability analysis,"
"fading modeling in maritime container terminal environments","2018","In this paper, an analytical model for slow and fast fading effects in maritime container terminals is derived, from fitting distributions to the results of measurements performed in an actual operational environment. The proposed model is composed of a set of equations, enabling to evaluate fading statistical distribution parameters for different system and environments conditions, as a function of frequency, base station antenna height, and average height of container stacks in a deepwater container terminal. The model's coefficients were obtained from a multivariate linear regression of the fitted distributions parameters, allowing to evaluate the different statistical distribution parameters with a negligible mean error and a standard deviation of the error less than 0.65 dB. It is observed that a good fitting is obtained for slow fading with the Lognormal Distribution, the standard deviation ranging in [1.40, 4.81] dB, while fast fading is well modeled by the Nakagami Distribution with the standard deviation ranging in [0.43, 1.26]. Hence, in a conservative perspective, values of 5 and 1.3 dB are proposed to characterize slow and fast fading, respectively.","Antennas,Rayleigh channels,maritime container terminal,statistical distribution fitting,Lognormal Distribution,slow fading,fading,Antenna measurements,Nakagami channels,base station antenna height,regression analysis,shadowing,log normal distribution,Containers,negligible mean error,Standards,Nakagami Distribution,multivariate linear regression,maritime container terminals,statistical distribution parameters,fading statistical distribution parameters,fast fading effects,fitted distributions parameters,marine communication,container stacks,Channel model,Statistical distributions,maritime container terminal environments,deepwater container terminal,"
"textual risk mining for maritime situational awareness","2014","In this paper, we propose an auxiliary Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) integrated system for maritime situational awareness (MSA) operations. We bring into account a new and influential asset - human intuition and perception - to the existing semi-automated decision support systems that mostly rely on numerical data collected by electronic sensors or cameras located either directly on the vessels or in the maritime command-and-control centers. For our project, we gathered weekly textual reports spanning twelve months from the United States Worldwide Threats to Shipping Reports repository that belongs to the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), We considered the maritime incident reports written by human operators as a valuable and accessible unstructured textual input source in which a span of text1 is called â€œriskâ€ if it expresses one of the following kinds of vessel incidents: fired, robbed, boarded, hijacked, attacked, chased, approached, kidnapped, boarding attempted, suspiciously approached or clashed with. Our approach benefits from probability distributions of some useful features annotated based on a list of lexicons that contain expressions denoting vessel types, risks types, risk associates, maritime geographical locations, dates and times. These distributions are captured and used to anchor the span of â€œrisksâ€ as they are described in the textual reports. After some preprocessing steps that include tokenization, named entity extraction and part-of-speech tagging, the textual risk mining system applies a variety of sequence classification algorithms, e.g., Conditional Random Fields, Conditional Markov Models and Hidden Markov Models in order to compare the risk classification performance. Empirical results show that our NLP/ML-based system can extract variable-length risk spans from the textual reports with about 90% correctness.","Markov processes,decision support systems,hidden Markov models,statistical distributions,tokenization,Risk management,attacked vessel incident,human intuition,Hidden Markov models,maritime geographical locations,conditional Markov models,maritime domain awareness,maritime command-and-control centers,Feature extraction,natural language processing,chased vessel incident,entity extraction,variable-length risk span extraction,maritime incident reports,maritime situational awareness,sequence classification algorithms,conditional random fields,robbed vessel incident,electronic sensors,United States worldwide threats to shipping reports repository,maritime situational awareness operation,fired vessel incident,marine safety,National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency,marine engineering,boarded vessel incident,feature annotation,machine learning,semiautomated decision support systems,cameras,part-of-speech tagging,risk management,NLP/ML-based system,Classification algorithms,probability distributions,risks types,risk classification performance,textual risk mining system,weekly textual reports,auxiliary ML,auxiliary machine learning,hijacked vessel incident,command and control systems,vessels,human perception,vessel types,MSA operation,kidnapped vessel incident,risk associates,risk detection,NGA,text analysis,boarding attempted vessel incident,approached vessel incident,Data mining,learning (artificial intelligence),sequence-based classifiers,"
"vulnerability and resilience of transportation systems: a recent literature review","2021","With the development of integrated and intelligent transportation systems, the stability and security of system performance are highly emphasized. Resilience and vulnerability are representative indicators in the performance analysis of transportation systems. A large number of related studies have emerged in recent years. Therefore, this paper reviews the recent progress in the study of vulnerability and resilience. Specific definitions of resilience and vulnerability are first given from the perspective of transportation system’s supply and demand. Other related concepts of transportation system performance (TSP) are also discussed including reliability, robustness, survivability and risk. The existing studies can be divided into two aspects, i.e., the traditional topological structure and system structure analysis. The study of topology structure mainly revolves around graph theory, which is also the cornerstone of TSP research. In recent years, advances in data analysis and model simulation technology have led to an increasing number of studies considering the overall transportation system structure. The related metrics and research methods are carefully analyzed and summarized from qualitative and quantitative perspectives. Research challenges are discussed, and future directions are presented.","Resilience,Network performance,Transportation system,Vulnerability,"
"changes in maritime traffic patterns according to installation of floating lidar using spatial analysis","2023","Recently, with the development of marine space around the world, friction between maritime traffic and various marine activities is intensifying. In particular, different recommendations are being made for the buffer zone between offshore wind farms and maritime traffic, as the criteria vary significantly. In order to respond to these changes in marine space, conducted this study on the change of maritime traffic patterns before and after the installation of floating LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) in marine facilities and apply it to future changes in maritime traffic patterns. The maritime traffic data was based on Automatic Identification System (AIS) data, and it was targeted at cargo ships and tankers with regular traffic patterns. A trajectory and spatial analysis were performed based on the AIS in the marine space. As a result of analyzing the globally maritime traffic patterns targeting the location of the installation complex of LiDARs, it can be confirmed that the existing maritime traffic patterns change into three maritime traffic patterns. Furthermore, the study employed the Hausdorff-distance algorithm for clustering analysis, categorizing vessels with similar trajectories. This approach facilitated a locally analysis of the buffer zone associated with individual LiDAR, considering the length of the vessels. As a result, it was analyzed that each vessel navigated at different buffer zone depending on the size of the vessel, and it is possible for safe navigation and forecast the future maritime traffic patterns.","Traffic control,Maritime traffic,maritime traffic data,buffer zone,Marine vehicles,wind power plants,globally maritime traffic patterns,Laser radar,marine space,existing maritime traffic patterns change,ships,marine safety,marine engineering,Wind farms,marine facilities,Oceans,regular traffic patterns,pattern clustering,Artificial intelligence,offshore installations,optical radar,future maritime traffic patterns,telecommunication traffic,spatial analysis,automatic identification system (AIS),Analytical models,"
"classification of daily heavy precipitation patterns and associated synoptic types in the campania region (southern italy)","2023","Using a 20-year (2002−2021) dataset of daily precipitation collected by 107 rain gauges in the period from October to May, this study introduces a classification of the main heavy precipitation spatial patterns for the Campania Region (southern Italy). To pursue this aim, we apply a cluster analysis on the most relevant principal modes extracted from a principal component analysis of the between-day correlation matrix. The characteristics of the identified patterns, as well as their interannual and monthly distribution, are presented and discussed. Moreover, using global and regional reanalysis products, we have determined the large-scale and mesoscale atmospheric circulation types associated with heavy precipitation patterns. The heavy precipitation episodes are generally triggered by an upper level trough approaching the southern Italy from west and promoting a very moist southwesterly flow. They have been clustered into six different patterns. The first four exhibit a rainfall amount distribution strongly connected with the orography of the investigated region. In such scenarios, the orographic lifting, the low-level wind convergence induced by the orography and the transport of moisture from local sources (the western and the southern Mediterranean) and from distant regions (the Atlantic and the Africa tropical areas) can be regarded as the primary forcing of heavy rainfall. In the other two patterns, the highest precipitation is generally observed in the coastal areas (Gulfs of Naples and Salerno) and in the northwestern side of the region (Caserta district), respectively. In such circumstances, the abundant precipitation is closely linked to convective activity over the Tyrrhenian Sea, which is sustained by a low-level convergence and, in the sixth pattern, by a moisture plume coming from the tropics. The results of this study provide new insights about the links between torrential precipitation spatial distribution and atmospheric circulation schemes in the southern Italy and promise to add a useful contribution for civil protection activities related to the management of environmental risks.","Rainfall spatial patterns,Atmospheric circulation types,Heavy precipitation events,Cluster analysis,"

"droughts in east africa: causes, impacts and resilience","2019","East Africa (EA) has been the primary focus for various drought studies in recent years. However, a comprehensive analysis of droughts, including their evolution, complexity, social implications and people's vulnerability is currently lacking. Hence, there is a pressing need for an overview of drought studies in EA. Here, we present a state-of-the-art review of the causes and impacts of, and resilience to droughts in EA. Studies reveal that droughts tend to be more frequent, longer and more severe in the boreal spring and summer in EA, as the overall precipitation and water storage abruptly decline. A decrease in drought frequency is observed during the boreal autumn season (October–November). As these studies have only been analysed within the context of sparse and short-term regional climate data with very complex spatial and seasonal climate patterns, they are subject to uncertainties. The main causes for the changing pattern of droughts include climate variabilities and anthropogenic effects. Droughts have extensive impacts on human beings, environment, water resources and agriculture. Environmental rehabilitation involving the development of ecosystem services, biodiversity enhancement and soil and water conservation is found to be a suitable strategy to adapt to drought conditions. A better understanding of the causes and impacts of droughts, participatory management and community level actions are essential for building resilience to drought. Strong citizens–government–stakeholder cooperation is also valuable in monitoring and managing drought. The knowledge and insights gained from this review will help the countries in EA to build a drought-resilient society and will form a basis of information for other regions outside of EA.","Rainfall,Anthropogenic activities,Horn of Africa,Drought,East Africa,Climate variability,"

"a framework for discovering maritime traffic conflict from ais network","2017","Thanks for the common use of Automatic Identification System (AIS) network has made a large number of the maritime traffic data to be available. Ships equipped with AIS automatically exchange navigational information with nearby ships and terrestrial AIS receivers to facilitate the tracking and monitoring of ships' location and movement for collision avoidance and control. Obviously, with increasing amount of maritime shipping traffic, the navigational collisions are one of the growing safety concerns in maritime traffic situation awareness. To understand the collision situations can help the maritime traffic managers to improve the safety control of maritime traffic. However, it is difficult to statistically analyze such collision due to the number of collected real cases of collisions are relatively low within a short period of time. To overcome the problem of low sample size, we discover traffic conflict from data collected by AIS network to substitute the real collision. Given a set of maritime traffic data collected from AIS network, we try to discover ships' movements that have conflict behaviors and these behaviors may bring a possible collision if they do not take any evasive action. We propose a framework of Clustering-and-Detection to automatically discover the clusters of conflict trajectory from AIS trajectory data in an unsupervised way. Based on real AIS data, the experimental results show that the proposed framework is able to effectively discover sets of trajectory with conflict situation from maritime AIS traffic data. The statistical analysis on the discovered sets of conflict trajectory is able to provide useful knowledge for maritime traffic monitoring.","maritime traffic situation awareness,maritime traffic monitoring,maritime shipping traffic,maritime traffic conflict,maritime AIS traffic data,collision situations,Safety,maritime traffic data,Automatic Identification System network,Marine vehicles,AIS network,ships,marine safety,marine engineering,real AIS data,terrestrial AIS receivers,pattern clustering,Trajectory data mining,Artificial intelligence,safety control,conflict behaviors,clustering-and-detection,AIS data,Roads,Trajectory,conflict trajectory,conflict situation,Conflict detection,Maritime traffic data,Navigation,navigation,nearby ships,collision avoidance,Data mining,navigational collisions,maritime traffic managers,Navigation collision,"
"disentangling dust and sand deposition using a peat record in ce europe (northern romania): a multiproxy approach","2019","Aeolian sediments play an important role in the global climatic system and occur in the atmosphere due to soil and bedrock erosion. Here, we applied three different methods: geochemical (XRF), manual and laser-based particle size analysis to an ombrotrophic peat profile in the Carpathian Mountains to determine changes in aeolian deposition and wind/storm activity over the last 7800 years. The results show the following changes in aeolian fluxes (dust and sand) over time: 7800–4150 cal. yr BP – generally low dust fluxes with a periodic intensification of sand fluxes; 4150–2300 cal. yr BP – intense deposition of both dust and sand; 2300–150 cal. yr BP – fluctuating dust and sand fluxes; the last 200 years – the highest amplitude of both sand and dust fluxes. This study found that patterns in aeolian fluxes were influenced by a combination of climate and human impact, but with anthropogenic drivers, such as disturbance by fire, becoming more important in recent times. We also found a good agreement with other studies of dust fluxes for the earlier part of this record, but an increasing divergence over the last 3500 years. In terms of a methodological approach, we suggest that the three approaches each have both advantages and disadvantages; though overall laser-based particle size dust and sand reconstruction appears to best capture the most complex changes in both aeolian deposition rates and sources.","Particulate mineralogy,Manual counting of sand particles,Particle size analysis,Aeolian particles,Geochemistry,"

"filament formation and evolution in buoyant coastal waters: observation and modelling","2012","This paper presents a detailed analysis of the formation and subsequent evolution of filament-like structures observed in a relatively small area of the mid-Tyrrhenian Sea (Mediterranean Sea). The filament dynamics and potential impact on the cross-shelf exchange budget are investigated based on a combined use of remote sensing imagery, in situ data and numerical modelling. The complexity of these phenomena is shown by focusing on four distinct events that led to cross-shelf transport, each representative of a different dynamic process and a distinct expected impact on the coastal area. A systematic analysis of available observations for the years 1998–2006 underlines the role of the interplay of atmospheric freshwater fluxes, river loads and wind stress variations, which may create favourable conditions for the convergence of shelf waters (particularly at coastal capes) and the subsequent formation of short-lived filaments along the coast. The response of the buoyant coastal waters to periods of wind reversal and fluctuating freshwater discharge rates is examined through idealised Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) simulations. The filaments observed in remote sensing imagery were well reproduced by the numerical exercise, where the filaments appear as organised submesoscale structures that possess high relative vorticity and develop at the river mouths or adjacent capes. In both scenarios, the filaments appear largely determined by (i) the presence of a buoyancy anomaly, (ii) the angle between the wind pulse direction and the coast and (iii) irregularities in the coastal profile. The ensemble of results suggests that the occurrence of such transient, intense structures may contribute considerably to the biological variability and cross-shelf exchange in coastal areas with similar traits.",""
"iso-kinematic maps from statistical analysis of ps-insar data of piemonte, nw italy: comparison with geological kinematic trends","2011","SAR interferometry based on Permanent Scatterers (PS-InSAR™) is used here to study the present crustal mobility of a large area of NW Italy, in the Piemonte region. Thirty-eight satellite scenes (ERS SAR), taken from May 1992 to January 2001, were analysed for detecting more than 2million PS on the study area. Continuous velocity surface maps (Iso-Kinematic Maps: IKM) were obtained from geo-statistical and spatial cluster techniques (Hot Spot analysis) of PS “short-period” data, to identify relative ground motions and to compare them with “long-period” tectonic mobility trends, i.e. those inferred at regional scale over geological times (some million years). The comparison was made by individuation of homogeneous kinematic areas, represented in the IKM, and characterization of the boundaries between them (Iso-Kinematic Boundaries: IKB). The IKB were used as tools to asses if the PS-InSAR data on present-day crustal mobility could fit with the distribution of real tectonic structures or field geological elements. IKM were drawn for uplifting geological sectors of Piemonte (Maritime Alps, Gran Paradiso, Langhe) where moderate to very low seismicity is recorded, and gravitational instabilities of rock mass on mountain slopes are widespread. The land sectors have been chosen in order to test the suitability of IKM in very different geo-morphological conditions. Different types of correspondence between the IKM and the geological kinematic trend were found:-a first type in which the kinematic trend of short-period (a decade of years, i.e. the PS-InSAR detection time span) is in agreement with a long-period tectonic trend (some million years) and seem to be driven by well known faults subparallel to the IKB. These kinematic trends can be hidden by the slope movement due to gravitational instabilities;-a second type in which the kinematic trend of short-period does not strictly correspond to the long-period trend, but can be considered as minor-order, uplifting-subsidence cycles, even if in contrast with the long-period kinematic trend. Alternatively, the short-period kinematic trends could reflect the action of deep-seated geological forces or structures, not yet known or inferable (at least with the recorded PS-InSAR velocities) on the basis of the available geological data and models.",""
"influence of climate variability on anchovy reproductive timing off northern chile","2016","We investigated the relationship between environmental variables and the Gonadosomatic Monthly Mean (GMM) index of anchovy (Engraulis ringens) to understand how the environment affects the dynamics of anchovy reproductive timing. The data examined corresponds to biological information collected from samples of the landings off northern Chile (18°21′S, 24°00′S) during the period 1990–2010. We used the Humboldt Current Index (HCI) and the Multivariate ENSO Index (MEI), which combine several physical-oceanographic factors in the Tropical and South Pacific regions. Using the GMM index, we studied the dynamics of anchovy reproductive timing at different intervals of length, specifically females with a length between 11.5 and 14cm (medium class) and longer than 14cm (large class). Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Mobile Average (SARIMA) was used to predict missing observations. The trends of the environment and reproductive indexes were explored via the Breaks For Additive Season and Trend (BFAST) statistical technique and the relationship between these indexes via cross-correlation functions (CCF) analysis. Our results showed that the habitat of anchovy switched from cool to warm condition, which also influenced gonad development. This was revealed by two and three significant changes (breaks) in the trend of the HCI and MEI indexes, and two significant breaks in the GMM of each time series of anchovy females (medium and large). Negative cross-correlation between the MEI index and GMM of medium and large class females was found, indicating that as the environment gets warmer (positive value of MEI) a decrease in the reproductive activity of anchovy can be expected. Correlation between the MEI index and larger females was stronger than with medium females. Additionally, our results indicate that the GMM index of anchovy for both length classes reaches two maximums per year; the first from August to September and the second from December to January. The intensity (maximum GMM values at rise point) of reproductive activity was not equal though, with the August–September peak being the highest. We also discuss how the synchronicity between environment and reproductive timing, the negative correlation found between MEI and GMM indexes, and the two increases per year of anchovy GMM relate to previous studies. Based on these findings we propose ways to advance in the understanding of how anchovy synchronize gonad development with the environment.","Length,Reproduction,Anchovy,Environment,Northern Chile,Humboldt Current System,"
"a real-time scene parsing network for autonomous maritime transportation","2023","On the sea, scene parsing, one of the most basic environmental perception methods for autonomous tasks, helps autonomous devices safely navigate and avoid obstacles. However, most of the existing methods lack real-time performance and have difficulty accurately detecting small obstacles and changeable textures. We, therefore, propose a real-time scene-parsing network for autonomous maritime transportation. Specifically, we first design a lightweight model framework and then explore three efficient loss functions, such that a balance between accuracy and real-time performance can be achieved. The first loss function is an obstacle-weighted loss, which improves the extraction of small obstacles by analyzing the distribution law of obstacles at sea. The second one is a detail loss, which optimizes the detail segmentation at complex contours by emphasizing edge features. The last one is an affinity loss, utilizing the context dependency between features to accurately detect reflections, ripples, and other changeable textures. In addition, a new maritime sense-parsing dataset called Greater Bay Area (GBA) dataset is proposed and made publicly available. We tested the proposed model on the GBA dataset and MaSTr1325 dataset, and the experimental results show that the proposed method achieves superior performance in both segmentation and speed, with mean intersection over union (mIOU) of 94.59% and an FPS of 39.44.","Decoding,autonomous tasks,autonomous devices,affinity loss,deep learning (artificial intelligence),obstacle-weighted loss,Greater Bay Area (GBA) dataset,real-time,maritime scene parsing,robot vision,marine navigation,Feature extraction,real-time scene-parsing network,Meteorology,basic environmental perception methods,object detection,feature extraction,efficient loss functions,real-time scene parsing network,neural net architecture,maritime sense-parsing dataset,Real-time systems,detail loss,Context prior (CP),obstacle weighted loss,autonomous maritime transportation,Training,loss function,unmanned surface vehicles,mobile robots,real-time performance,Navigation,Task analysis,image segmentation,collision avoidance,changeable textures,"
"application of structural topic modeling to aviation safety data","2022","Data-driven frameworks for analyzing aviation safety data have recently gained traction. Text-based machine learning techniques often rely purely on word frequency analysis to eliminate the innate subjectivity of human language, but more refined techniques like structural topic modeling (STM) attempt to simulate text generation to identify the thematic undertones of text corpora. This paper presents an application of STM to two text-based sets of aviation safety data, the Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS) and accident and incident reports published by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). A framework for cleaning and pre-processing the datasets is discussed, including a brief discussion of bag-of-words and TF–IDF representations of narratives. The methodology behind STM is described, including techniques for selecting the optimal number of topics. The results of the STM analysis on the ASRS and NTSB datasets are presented, with a focus on the clarity and specificity based on most common words associated with topics. A brief exploration of the correlation between pairs of topic labels is also undertaken, including a visualization of narratives in 2-dimensional space.

"impact of mining-induced deforestation on soil surface temperature and carbon stocks: a case study using remote sensing in the amazon rainforest","2022","The Amazon rainforest is one of the most important ecosystems on the planet; however, the environmental pressure created by anthropic activities require monitoring of this critical biome. In this study, we assessed the evolution of deforestation in an open mine pit and its impact on surface environment (i.e., temperature and carbon stocks) using remote sensing techniques. The study was carried out on an area of 11,283.3 ha in the municipality of Marabá, Pará State, Brazil, where the “Salobo” copper mine is located. A temporal analysis was conducted, using Landsat satellite images (2005–2020). Subsequently, the Land Surface Temperature (LST) and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) of the deforested area were determined. Mining-induced deforestation has expanded from 0.9 ha in 2005 to 2214 ha in 2020 with an increase in surface temperature of 10 °C in the period. The temperature difference between the pit and the adjacent forest ranged from 30 to 40 °C over the 15 years, while the temperature at the forest edges rose by 4 °C. The correlation coefficient between exposed soil temperatures and mining deforestation was 0.66. CO2 emissions, increasing from 0.005 Tg CO2 in 2005 to 1.82 Tg CO2 in 2020 due to mining deforestation. The findings demonstrate the significant environmental impact of deforestation, which may also have an influence on local climate. The results can provide scientific support for public policies aimed at mitigating the issue.","Forest areas,Remote sensing,Climate warming,Carbon emission,Deforestation monitoring,"
"a smart predict-then-optimize method for targeted and cost-effective maritime transportation","2023","In maritime transportation, port state control (PSC) is the last line of defense against substandard ships. During a PSC inspection, PSC officers (PSCOs) identify ship deficiencies that lead to a ship's detention, which can cause severe economic and reputational losses to the ship operator. Therefore, this study innovatively uses PSC inspection data to design ship maintenance plans for ship operators to minimize overall operational costs. We identify three types of operational costs associated with each deficiency code: inspection cost, repair cost, and risk cost in the ship operators’ decision-making process. The risk cost of a deficiency code is strongly related to the detention contribution of the deficiency items under a deficiency code, as indicated by the feature importance of that code in the random forest (RF) model used to predict detention outcomes. To design ship maintenance plans, the sequential predict-then-optimize (PO) method typically solves the optimization problem using input parameters, including the predicted probabilities of having deficiency items under each code and the three types of operational costs. However, the loss function in this two-stage framework does not consider the effect of predictions on the downstream decisions. Hence, we use a smart predict-then-optimize (SPO) method using an ensemble of SPO trees (SPOTs). Each SPOT uses an SPO loss function that measures the sub-optimality of the decisions derived from the predicted parameters. By exploiting the structural properties of the optimization problem analyzed in this study, we demonstrate that training an SPOT for this problem can be simplified tremendously by using the relative class frequency of true labels within a leaf node to yield a minimum SPO loss. Computational experiments show that the SPO-based ship maintenance scheme is superior to other schemes and can reduce a ship's total operating expenses by approximately 1% over the PO-based scheme and by at least 3% over schemes that do not use machine learning methods. In the long run, SPO-based ship maintenance plans also improve the efficiency of port logistics by reducing the resources needed for formal PSC inspections and alleviating port congestion.","Prescriptive analytics,Data-driven optimization,Port state control (PSC) inspection,Ship maintenance planning,"
"genotype/phenotype correlations in aniridia","1998","PURPOSE: To detect and characterize mutations in cases of familial and sporadic aniridia in Maritime Canada, and to look for indications of genotype/phenotype correlation within the cohort. METHODS: Twelve consecutive and unrelated patients (probands) who had total or nearly complete absence of irides, and four affected relatives, were recruited from Maritime Canada. Clinical data were obtained by chart review and electroretinogram testing. Mutations in the PAX6 gene were detected by single-strand conformation polymorphism and characterized by sequence analysis. RESULTS: Eleven different PAX6 mutations, 10 of which are novel, were found. The four patients with congenital cataracts all had mutations in the C-terminal proline-serine-threonine (PST)–rich domain of the PAX6 protein. Electroretinograms of nine of 11 patients displayed depressed scotopic maximum response b-wave amplitudes. The greatest decrease in b-wave amplitudes was seen in patients in whom the paired domain was disrupted by mutation.

The successful forestation programs implemented in China-which have improved the ecological environmental conditions-have gained the attention of many researchers and highlighted the relationship between forestation and water yields. The arid and semi-arid Loess Plateau has received attention from water engineers and eco-hydrological researchers in China because of a shortage in water resources. We selected one of the oldest stations conducting soil and water conservation experiments, the Xifeng soil and water conservation station, and chose the Nanxiaohe catchment and its paired catchments (Yangjiagou catchment and Dongzhuanggou catchment) as our research areas. Trends in precipitation, air temperature, streamflow over the past 50 years, and the effect of changing land use on streamflow were analyzed. The Mann-Kendall test showed that precipitation had a negative trend (downward trend), whereas air temperature showed a positive trend (upward trend) from the past to present in the Nanxiaohe catchment. However, the trends seen in precipitation, air temperature did not contain any “jumping points.” The paired catchment approach is used to detect the effects of land cover change on hydrology in the Yangjiagou and the contrast catchment, i.e., Dongzhuanggou catchment in our study. The results showed a large change in land use in the Yangjiagou catchment from 1954 to 2008. An increase in forested land (from 0% to 40.08% from 1954 to 2008) and a reduction of bare land (from 51.26% to 5.50% from 1954 to 2008) accounted for a large part of the change in land use. However, the land use changed little in the contrast catchment. The comparison of streamflow in the paired catchments showed that forestation reduced streamflow by 49.63% (or 6.5 mm) each year.","Surface water hydrology,Loess Plateau of China,Forests,Land use/land cover change,Climate variability/change,"

"association rules and social network analysis for supporting failure mode effects and criticality analysis: framework development and insights from an onshore platform","2022","The ongoing digital transformation enables the collection of a vast amount of data from the maintenance and production processes. Hence, the techniques traditionally applied for monitoring the operations and defining the maintenance approaches for improving the asset reliability can be accompanied by new methodologies more oriented to data analytics. In this context, this work proposes a data-driven framework for supporting the analysis of the production processes in terms of failures and related effects through the well-known and widely applied Failure Mode, Effect, and Criticality Analysis (FMECA). Indeed, after developing the Failure Mode Effects and Criticality Analysis, the results obtained for the plant under investigation are elaborated through Machine Learning techniques such as the Association Rule Mining to define the cause-effect relationships that led to a failure. The association rules extracted are then processed through the Social Network Analysis to represent such relationships, facilitate their comprehension, and identify the existence of communities of nodes to detect critical patterns and locate the most influential nodes. The knowledge of such details can provide helpful support in terms of awareness of the plant and the development of intelligent maintenance procedures. The proposed approach is applied to an off-shore and on-shore platform to assess the impact of the theoretical analysis on the practical implementation by highlighting unknown relations among the analyzed variables and showing new cause-effect relationships.","Machine Learning,Failure Mode Effects and Criticality Analysis,Risk-Based Maintenance,Association Rule Mining,Data-driven approach,Social Network Analysis,"
"fitting empirical distributions for vessels behavioural analysis and maritime anomaly detection","2023","Naval behaviour characterization and maritime anomaly detection represents two active area of research. Although multiple probabilistic approaches have been implemented for explaining different parametric maritime phenomena, most of them are focused only on the analysis of primary kinematic data, such as position, speed, course of vessels, or lateral displacement relative to an obstacle. This article presents an analysis on multiple complex maritime activities (e.g., fishing, drifting, hidden activities) that were derived by processing AIS messages collected in the Black Sea region. Quantitative histograms were made for each type of activity while probability and cumulative distribution functions were plotted using kernel density estimation applications. After that, multiple evaluation metrics analysed the possibilities of representing these distributions in the form of known parametric distributions (e.g., Gaussian, Gamma, Rayleigh, Log-normal). Finally, there were extracted the parameters that best fitted these distributions. Also, a universal parametric distribution was searched to best fit all observed maritime activities.","statistical distributions,universal parametric distribution,kernel density estimation applications,Safety,primary kinematic data,AIS messages,vessel behavioural analysis,Sea measurements,cumulative distribution functions,parametric maritime phenomena,probabilistic approaches,quantitative histograms,marine engineering,hidden activities,AIS,vessels behaviour,Probabilistic logic,Probability distribution,probability distribution fitting,Measurement,maritime anomaly detection,Statistical analysis,empirical distributions,naval behaviour characterization,Fitting,Black Sea region,empirical data,data handling,multiple complex maritime activities,"
"cooperative collision avoidance study of maritime autonomous surface ship","2021","Maritime Autonomous Surface Ships (MASS) with the advantage of advanced guidance, navigation, and control capabilities have attracted great attention in recent years. The MASS collect travelling information by the radar, camera, and Autonomous Identification System (AIS) with which it is equipped. Therefore, collision avoidance of MASS turns to be a cooperative and collaborative one by utilizing the interactive information efficiently and effectively. During the collision avoidance procedure of MASS, steering and deceleration are the common actions. In order to receive an efficient and reasonable steering angle and navigation time on the new course, a communication-based real time collaborative collision avoidance decision model is proposed. Firstly, a multi-level communication method is utilized to integrate dynamic information of surrounding vessels. Secondly, a real time collision risk analysis system for MASS is established based on fuzzy logic method. Finally, a collaborative collision avoidance decision system based on the PSO (Particle Swarm Optimization) algorithm is developed to find the optimal steering angle and sailing time on a new course. Comparative analysis about collision avoidance decision results are discussed in simulations. The results show that the model raised in this paper is able to provide effective collision risk awareness and collision avoidance decisions for MASS in a real-time situation.","Transportation,cooperative collision avoidance,Safety,Risk analysis,efficient steering angle,deceleration,collision avoidance procedure,collision risk index,fuzzy logic,particle swarm optimisation,advanced guidance,travelling information,optimal steering angle,ships,steering systems,time collision risk analysis system,communication-based real time collaborative collision avoidance decision model,telecommunication congestion control,dynamic information,collaborative collision avoidance decision system,Autonomous Identification System,Collaboration,collision avoidance decision results,control capabilities,interactive information,Radar,Real-time systems,maritime autonomous surface ships (MASS),multilevel communication method,risk analysis,reasonable steering angle,Maritime Autonomous Surface Ships,effective collision risk awareness,collision avoidance study,Navigation,navigation,fuzzy logic algorithm,collision avoidance,particle swarm optimization algorithm,sailing time,maritime Autonomous Surface ship,collision avoidance decisions,"
"analysis and hindcast simulations of an extreme rainfall event in the mediterranean area: the genoa 2011 case","2014","The city of Genoa, which places between the Tyrrhenian Sea and the Apennine mountains (Liguria, Italy) was rocked by severe flash floods on the 4th of November, 2011. Nearly 500mm of rain, a third of the average annual rainfall, fell in six hours. Six people perished and millions of Euros in damages occurred. The synoptic-scale meteorological system moved across the Atlantic Ocean and into the Mediterranean generating floods that killed 5 people in Southern France, before moving over the Ligurian Sea and Genoa producing the extreme event studied here. Cloud-permitting simulations (1km) of the finger-like convective system responsible for the torrential event over Genoa have been performed using Advanced Research Weather and Forecasting Model (ARW-WRF, version 3.3). Two different microphysics (WSM6 and Thompson) as well as three different convection closures (explicit, Kain–Fritsch, and Betts–Miller–Janjic) were evaluated to gain a deeper understanding of the physical processes underlying the observed heavy rain event and the model's capability to predict, in hindcast mode, its structure and evolution. The impact of forecast initialization and of model vertical discretization on hindcast results is also examined. Comparison between model hindcasts and observed fields provided by raingauge data, satellite data, and radar data show that this particular event is strongly sensitive to the details of the mesoscale initialization despite being evolved from a relatively large scale weather system. Only meso-γ details of the event were not well captured by the best setting of the ARW-WRF model and so peak hourly rainfalls were not exceptionally well reproduced. The results also show that specification of microphysical parameters suitable to these events have a positive impact on the prediction of heavy precipitation intensity values.","Flash flood,Numerical modeling,Deep convection,"

In the maritime domain, modern TDS is connected to various sensors such as Radar, Automatic Identification System (AIS), and Tactical Data Link Processor (TDLP) where each sensor usually has its independent tracking system. The tracks of each tracker must be associated and fused so that valid and reliable information about situational awareness appears in TDS. Each of the data generated by trackers has different characteristics and problems, which prompted many researchers to formulate algorithms suitable for track associations. In this paper, we present the results of our preliminary research regarding the track association to be used in maritime TDS.

"deep reinforcement learning based latency minimization for mobile edge computing with virtualization in maritime uav communication network","2022","The rapid development of maritime activities has led to the emergence of more and more computation-intensive applications. In order to meet the huge demand for wireless communications in maritime environment, mobile edge computing (MEC) is considered as an effective solution to provide powerful computing capabilities for maritime terminals of resource scarcity or latency sensitive. A basic technology to implement MEC is virtual machine (VM) multiplexing, through which multi-task parallel computing on a server is realized. In this paper, a two-layer unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) maritime communication network with a centralized top-UAV (T-UAV) and a group of distributed bottom-UAVs (B-UAVs) is established and MEC is used on T-UAV. We aim to solve the latency minimization problem for both communication and computation in this maritime UAV swarm mobile edge computing network. We reformulate this problem into a Markov decision process (MDP), since it is a non-convex and multiply constrained but has the characteristics of MDP. Based on this MDP model, we take deep reinforcement learning (DRL) as our tool to propose a deep Q-network (DQN) and a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithms to optimize the trajectory of T-UAV and configuration of virtual machines (VMs). Using these two proposed algorithms, we can minimize the system latency. Simulation results show that the given solutions are valid and effective.","Markov processes,virtualisation,deep learning (artificial intelligence),minimisation,maritime terminals,control engineering computing,Resource management,multitask parallel computing,deep reinforcement learning,mobile edge computing (MEC),Servers,Maritime communications,latency minimization,Maritime communication,UAV trajectory design,mobile computing,maritime UAV communication network,reinforcement learning,virtual machine multiplexing,MEC,maritime UAV swarm mobile edge computing network,virtual machines,distributed bottom-UAVs,wireless communications,autonomous aerial vehicles,top-UAV,Optimization,parallel processing,unmanned aerial vehicles maritime communication network,Trajectory,mobile robots,marine communication,B-UAVs,deep Q-network,deep deterministic policy gradient,virtual machine (VM),Task analysis,Parallel processing,marine control,T-UAV,Markov decision process,maritime activities,bottom-UAVs,B,virtualization,deep reinforcement learning (DRL),"
"maritime route and vessel tracklet dataset for vessel-to-route association","2022","With an ever-increasing number of vessels at sea, the modelling, analysis and visualisation of maritime traffic are of paramount importance to support the monitoring tasks of maritime stakeholders. Sensors have been developed in this respect to track vessels and capture the maritime traffic at the global scale. The Automatic Identification System (AIS) is transmitting maritime positional and nominative information at highest frequency rate, making it a valuable source for maritime traffic modelling. From an original AIS dataset covering the area of Brest, France, we extracted a set of 17 maritime routes, connecting ports in this area. Two different representations for the routes are provided: (1) clusters of AIS contacts, and (2) route prototypes, representing the nominal trajectory of the vessels following the route. Additionally, a set of tracklets (built by five consecutive AIS contacts from the same vessel trajectory) has been extracted from the set of routes and the original dataset, and labelled either with the route name to which they belong or as off-route tracklets. This dataset provides thus some ground truth on the routes followed by vessels and is aimed at testing and validating vessel-to-route or track-to-route association algorithms.","Track-to-route association,Vessel-to-route association,Route prototypes,Maritime routes,Automatic identification system,"

"mission management and landing assistance for an unmanned rotorcraft for maritime operations","2022","Unmanned rotorcraft operated from ships could be used in surveillance or rescue missions in maritime environments. Starting from and landing on a moving ship deck is a challenging task, though. For this purpose, mission management and landing strategies have to be tailored compared to land-based operations of unmanned rotorcraft. This paper focuses on the investigation of supporting functions and systems for the operation of unmanned rotorcraft from larger vessels. Relative navigation with the aid of double-differences can be used for guiding the rotorcraft precisely to the moving target. The landing task is complicated by ship deck motions varying with the sea state. Therefore, a tether connection is proposed for landing assistance. For autonomous operations a ground control station is necessary on the vessel. The control station is used for mission management including supervision and control of the rotorcraft, the tether system and for payload operations.

To address this challenge, we report results from our experimentation with MongoDB, a NoSQL document-based database which we test as a supporting platform for computational MSA.

"wavelet-based texture features for the classification of age classes in a maritime pine forest","2015","This letter evaluates the potential of wavelet-based texture modeling for the classification of stand age in a managed maritime pine forest using very high resolution panchromatic and multispectral PLEIADES data. A cross-validation approach based on stand age reference data is used to compare classification performances obtained from different multivariate models (multivariate Gaussian, spherically invariant random vector (SIRV)-based models, and Gaussian copulas) and from co-occurrence matrices. Results show that the multivariate modeling of the spatial dependence of wavelet coefficients (particularly when using the Gaussian SIRV model) outperforms the use of features derived from co-occurrence matrices. Simultaneously adding features representing the color dependence and leveling the dominant orientation in anisotropic forest stands enhances the classification performances.

"multi-scale approach to euro-atlantic climatic cycles based on phenological time series, air temperatures and circulation indexes","2017","The spectral periods in North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) and El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) were analyzed and has been verified how they imprint a time series of European temperature anomalies (ETA), two European temperature time series and some phenological series (dates of cherry flowering and grapevine harvest). Such work had as reference scenario the linear causal chain MCTP (Macroscale Circulation→Temperature→Phenology of crops) that links oceanic and atmospheric circulation to surface air temperature which in its turn determines the earliness of appearance of phenological phases of plants. Results show that in the three segments of the MCTP causal chain are present cycles with the following central period in years (the % of the 12 analyzed time series interested by these cycles are in brackets): 65 (58%), 24 (58%), 20.5 (58%), 13.5 (50%), 11.5 (58%), 7.7 (75%), 5.5 (58%), 4.1 (58%), 3 (50%), 2.4 (67%). A comparison with short term spectral peaks of the four El Niño regions (nino1+2, nino3, nino3.4 and nino4) show that 10 of the 12 series are imprinted by periods around 2.3–2.4yr while 50–58% of the series are imprinted by El Niño periods of 4–4.2, 3.8–3.9, 3–3.1years. The analysis highlights the links among physical and biological variables of the climate system at scales that range from macro to microscale whose knowledge is crucial to reach a suitable understanding of the ecosystem behavior. The spectral analysis was also applied to a time series of spring – summer precipitation in order to evaluate the presence of peaks common with other 12 selected series with result substantially negative which brings us to rule out the existence of a linear causal chain MCPP (Macroscale Circulation→Precipitation→Phenology).","ENSO,NAO,European temperatures,AMO,Spectral analysis,Grapevine and cherry phenology,"

SDA of BDS is the problem of analyzing, modeling and extracting information from huge amounts of data that continuously come from several sources in real time through com- putational aware solutions. Among others, CBM for Rail Transportation is one of the most challenging SDA problems, consisting of the implementation of a predictive maintenance system for evaluating the future status of the monitored assets in order to reduce risks related to failures and to avoid service disruptions. The challenge is to collect and analyze all the data streams that come from the numerous on-board sensors monitoring the assets. This paper deals with the problem of CBM applied to the condition monitoring and predictive maintenance of train axle bearings based on sensors data collection, with the purpose of maximizing their Remaining Useful Life (RUL). In particular we propose a novel algorithm for CBM based on SDA that takes advantage of the Online Support Vector Regression (OL-SVR) for predicting the RUL. The novelty of our proposal is the heuristic approach for optimizing the trade-off between the accuracy of the OL-SVR models and the computational time and resources needed in order to build them.

"desyco: a decision support system for the regional risk assessment of climate change impacts in coastal zones","2016","Several decision support systems were developed in recent years to encourage climate adaptation planning in coastal areas, especially at a national to global scale. However, few prototypes are easy to use and accessible for decision-makers to evaluate and manage risks locally. DESYCO is a GIS based decision support system specifically designed to better understand the risks that climate change poses at the regional/subnational scale (e.g. the effect of sea level rise and coastal erosion on human assets and ecosystems) and set the context of strategic adaptation planning within Integrated Coastal Zone Management. It implements a Regional Risk Assessment (RRA) methodology allowing the spatial assessment of multiple climate change impacts in coastal areas and the ranking of key elements at risk (beaches, wetlands, protected areas, urban and agricultural areas). The core of the system is a Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) model used to operationalize the steps of the RRA (hazard, exposure, susceptibility, risk and damage assessment) by integrating a blend of information from climate scenarios (global/regional climate projections and hydrodynamic/hydrological simulations) and from non-climate vulnerability factors (physical, environmental and socio-economic features of the analysed system). User-friendly interfaces simplify the interaction with the system, providing guidance for risk mapping, results communication and understanding. DESYCO was applied to low-lying coastal plains and islands (the North Adriatic Sea, the Gulf of Gabes and the Republic of Mauritius), river basins and groundwater systems (Upper Plain of Veneto and Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Marche Region). The paper presents the RRA methodology, the structure of DESYCO and its software architecture, showing the capabilities of the tool to support decision making and climate proofing in a wide range of situations (e.g. shoreline planning, land use and water resource management, flood risk reduction).","Geographic information systems (GIS),Climate change adaptation,Decision support systems (DSS),Risk assessment,Multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA),"
"consumer welfare and climate change in greenland","2019","This manuscript aims to assess the potential impact of climate change on consumer welfare in Greenland, an arctic economy that has been historically affected by climate variation. Three proxies for climate change: (i) annual mass change anomaly of the ice cap, (ii) annual temperature anomalies, and (iii) annual heating degree days anomalies are used to test the hypothesis that climate is a potential determinant of consumer expenditure. The Quadratic Almost Ideal Demand System, in its original specification, is used to test this hypothesis. The empirical analysis, supported by Granger-causality tests, shows that the annual mass change anomaly of the ice cap is a statistically and economically significant determinant of consumption of non-durable goods in Greenland. A counterfactual analysis predicts that climate change could have decreased the wealth of consumers with an aggregate cumulative social welfare loss of 2010-US$ 21.63 million between 2003 and 2017.","Consumer welfare,Transfer entropy causality,Maximum entropy econometrics,Melting Arctic ice,Greenland,Climate change,"
"anthropogenic influence on the occurrence of extreme drought like that in eastern china in 2019","2023","Eastern China (EC) experienced extreme drought during August–November 2019, with notable features of a particularly prolonged duration and record-breaking intensity, leading to huge agricultural and economic losses. In the context of anthropogenic climate change, the authors investigated the anthropogenic impacts on the occurrence of extreme drought like that in 2019 (2019Drought-like event) and the related physical mechanism. The authors first selected relatively better-performing models by evaluating their historical simulations, and found that the occurrence probability of a 2019Drought-like event increased by eight times due to anthropogenic forcing. It seems that anthropogenic forcing induces background mean state changes over EC, including a decline in mean moisture content and enhanced mean descending motion. These two mean state changes are favorable for the formation of extreme drought. Diagnosis of the moisture budget showed that the decline in mean moisture mainly stems from the enhanced mean descending motion via the term −δω¯·∂q¯∂p (vertical advection of mean moisture by the change in mean vertical motion). The enhanced descent is linked to the anthropogenic forcing–induced mean sea surface temperature warming pattern, which exhibits a maximum near the equatorial region. This reinforces the mean ascending motion over the Maritime Continent, as in “the rich-get-richer” mechanism, and further causes strengthened subsidence over the EC region through a “regional Hadley circulation”. This study suggests that anthropogenic forcing can sharply increase the occurrence probability of a 2019Drought-like event by modulating large-scale circulations. 摘要 2019年夏秋季中国东部遭遇了七十年一遇的强持续性极端干旱事件. 本文借助于CMIP6检测归因模式比较计划 (DAMIP) 数据, 量化了人为强迫对类似2019年极端干旱事件发生概率的影响. 通过比较不同外强迫因子作用下此类极端干旱事件的发生概率, 发现人为强迫可使此类极端干旱事件的发生概率提高8倍左右. 进一步研究发现人为强迫引起的海表温度增暖是经向不均匀的, 对应海洋大陆附近存在一个增暖大值中心, 从而增强海洋大陆地区平均上升环流, 通过局地Hadley环流作用导致中国东部地区平均垂直环流出现异常下沉, 最终有利于中国东部极端干旱事件发生概率增加. 该研究表明, 人为强迫通过调制气候平均背景场从而引起极端事件发生频次的变化是人类活动影响极端气候事件的重要途径之一.","Eastern China,中国东部,归因分析,关键词：,Attribution analysis,Anthropogenic impact,人为强迫,Extreme drought,极端干旱,"

"an efficient identity-based aggregate signcryption scheme with blockchain for iot-enabled maritime transportation system","2022","Maritime transportation has ushered in a period of vigorous development and has been the most critical mode of transport in international trade. Maritime communication is also becoming increasingly complex. This trend needs the IoT-enabled Maritime Transportation System (IMTS) to enhance its ability of privacy-preserving, performance continuously, and add the function of joint management. Although many aggregate signcryption (ASC) schemes have been presented to satisfy this requirement, they still suffer from performance deficiencies or security weaknesses. To address these issues, we design a more practical â€œPerception-Network-Applicationâ€ IoT-enabled MTS (PNA-IMTS) network structure. Then, we propose an efficient Identity-based aggregate signcryption scheme with blockchain (B-ID-ASC) for PNA-IMTS based on this network model. The security analysis shows that the B-ID-ASC scheme is capable of providing confidentiality and unforgeability. It also can resist existing known attacks (impersonation attack, modification attack, man-in-the-middle attack). The performance analysis indicates that our B-ID-ASC scheme, having lower computation and communication costs than current ASC schemes, is more applicable for PNA-IMTS.","practical Perception-Network-Application,Blockchains,Transportation,confidentiality,Internet of Things,IMTS,Wireless sensor networks,current ASC schemes,IoT-enabled Maritime Transportation System,Organizations,blockchains,security analysis,aggregate signcryption schemes,B-ID-ASC,blockchain,unforgeability,efficient Identity-based aggregate signcryption scheme,Aggregates,Relays,B-ID-ASC scheme,security weaknesses,Maritime communication,public key cryptography,performance deficiencies,IoT-enabled MTS,message authentication,marine communication,Receivers,PNA-IMTS,authorisation,data privacy,"
"halophyte die-off in response to anthropogenic impacts on tidal flats","2014","This study analyzed an abrupt change in halophyte populations, especially the annual plant Suaeda japonica. The boundaries and distributions of S. japonica and Phragmites australis were determined based on the decision tree classifier of TerraSAR-X, SAVI of Landsat ETM+, and density slicing of aerial photography. A large patch of S. japonica in the eastern parts of Donggum-do, South Korea, disappeared in 2007, while populations have been stable in the western parts of the island. To understand the reason behind the sudden die-off, mean sea level was analyzed based on gaged tidal data. Sedimentation rate was measured using Vernier caliper and RTK leveling data. Sedimentation rate between 2006 and 2007 was above the threshold at which S. japonica can germinate. After the loss of an 11-ha S. japonica patch from the eastern part of Donggum-do, sedimentation was accelerated because of a decrease in tidal current caused by a series of land reclamation projects. The increased monthly exposure duration due to continuous sediment accretion altered the type of salt marsh. Our results imply that accumulated effects from a series of coastal construction projects around Ganghwa-do can change not only tide and current hydrodynamics, but also sedimentation and erosion rates, which can cause large halophyte patches to disappear.","halophyte,sedimentation,tidal flat,salt marsh,"

Various approaches used for safety analysis have been discussed. Past major accidents and their consequences have been seen as a driving force for development of safety regulations and environmental protection policies. Safety analysis based on past reported incidents and accidents revealed that safety in the marine and offshore sector has been improving, however, due to operation in harsh environmental conditions and use of new technologies, new types of challenges, and risks continue to emerge. These emerging challenges and/or ineffective implementation of lessons learned from past accidents have been found to be responsible for the continued occurrence of marine and offshore accidents. Additionally, this chapter also outlines the purpose and organization of Volume 2.","Risk contributors,Overview,Major accidents,Marine and offshore safety,"
"automatic geo-registration of maritime video feeds","2008","We propose an automatic method to geo-register maritime video feeds to satellite images. The method first detects horizon during the day time and apex during the night time for similarity rectification. It then finds water pixels on both satellite images and camera views. Finally, geo-registration is obtained by searching the best orientation where the water masks are matched. The current state-art-of-state video surveillance system benefits with this method by providing situational awareness on maps with physical data including object size, location, and velocity in the world coordinates. Experimental results and applications such as cross camera tracking are demonstrated.","Satellites,Feeds,Pixel,similarity rectification,automatic geo-registration,Cameras,Principal component analysis,maritime video feeds,Application software,Optical reflection,water pixels,Target tracking,satellite images,Video surveillance,video signal processing,image registration,Boats,state-art-of-state video surveillance system,video surveillance,"

"an intelligent maritime communication signal recognition algorithm based on acwgan","2020","In maritime communications systems, there are marine VHF communications systems that meet GMDSS standards in addition to AIS and VDES systems which use very high-frequency signals for information communications such as security rescue. But because its communication does not contain the identity information, the channel is easy to be occupied maliciously, thus interferes in normal maritime communication. This paper studies and analyzes the individual identification technology of the VHF signal based on the rf fingerprint technology of signal. Using the improved adversarial generation network ACWGAN(Auxiliary Classifier Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks) to train and identify, we obtain a better classification result.

"low complexity maritime surveillance video using background subtraction on h.264","2015","Maritime surveillance video is crucial in monitoring the waters from seaborne threats. Maritime surveillance cameras typically operate by recording the designated areas for long hours, with most of the video storage recording empty sea and sky. Video compression efficiency can be improved by assigning moving objects in video frame as foreground objects and the rest of the frame as background. The background is then compressed at a higher compression ratio to achieve better compression without significant loss of image quality at the region of interest (ROI).

"organotin compounds in seawater and mytilus galloprovincialis mussels along the croatian adriatic coast","2012","In this work, data on the level of organotin compounds (OTCs) in seawater and mussels collected along the entire Croatian Adriatic Coast are presented. The samples were collected in 2009 and 2010 at 48 locations representing different levels of maritime activities, including marinas, ports and reference sites. Butyltins (BuTs) were found in all analyzed samples, representing >97% of OTCs, and ranged from 0.46 to 27.98ngSnL−1 in seawater and from <6 to 1675ngSng−1 in mussels. The results indicate a recent input of TBT, with the highest concentrations of BuTs found in the marinas. It appears that the Adriatic coast is still polluted with TBT despite the fact that TBT-containing antifouling paints have been banned in Croatia since 2008. It is questionable how much TBT pollution decreased since 2005, when a high incidence of imposex was established in the same area.","Mussels,Seawater,Croatian Adriatic Coast,Tributyltin (TBT),Organotin compounds (OTCs),"
"keynote: multi-domain situational awareness - from the underwater to the space domain to improve maritime surveillance","2022","Modern surveillance systems require to integrate coherently all available sources of information to compose an operational picture that is as complete as possible. While in the past surveillance had suffered from a lack of data, current technology transformed the problem into one of an overabundance of information, leading to an extreme need for automated analysis. Indeed, current surveillance sensors generate volumes of data that would have been unthinkable only a few years ago. Therefore, all the processing, algorithm calibration, parameter tuning, etc., need to be executed as much automatically as possible. This also requires novel paradigms for algorithmic design. In this respect, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Data Fusion (DF) offer an unprecedented opportunity to strengthen the technological edge; however, the risk is to elevate, at the same time, the speed of the threats we face. Indeed, the surveillance task is complicated by the diversification of threats, whose nature and origin is most often unknown. AI and DF techniques have the potential to identify patterns emerging within these very large datasets, fused from a variety of sources and generated from monitoring wide areas on a day-to-day basis, and use the learned knowledge to anticipate the possible evolution(s) of the operational picture. The presentation will focus on both real-world scenarios and theoretical models, spanning from the underwater to the space domain, including the analysis of scenarios with heterogeneous surveillance sensors (such as radar, sonar and satellite).

Thus, this paper describes a novel deep learning based maritime situation awareness approach using high-definition video. Maritime object detection is achieved in three main steps. At first, a key region based tracking algorithm allows to, dynamically and parsimoniously, extract high-quality region proposals mainly focalized around rigid (i.e.; potential object) video locations. The latter are, further, fed into a Fast-RCNN for carrying out objectness detection and box regression. Finally, a mere box post-regression operation enables to extract maritime objects. Furthermore, the found object detections are fed into a second classification RCNN, specifically, trained to recognize up to 40 vessel classes. Our experiments have shown that the proposed approach achieves state of the art speed and accuracy.","real-time maritime situation awareness,object detections,objectness detection,maritime situation awareness approach,high-definition video,key region based tracking algorithm,maritime objects,Streaming media,maritime object detection,regression analysis,Object recognition,neural nets,target tracking,deep learning,object tracking,marine engineering,Proposals,object detection,maritime targets,box post-regression operation,classification RCNN,video signal processing,maritime environment,Deep learning,Object detection,high-quality region proposals,Surveillance,Task analysis,learning (artificial intelligence),dynamic anchors,"
"climate control on late holocene high-energy sedimentation along coasts of the northeastern atlantic ocean","2017","Abundant sedimentological and geochronological data gathered on European sandy coasts highlight major phases of increased high-energy sedimentation in the North Atlantic Ocean during the late Holocene. Owing to an inconsistent use of the terminology, it is often difficult to determine whether studies have described storm-built or wave-built deposits. Both deposits can be identified by overall similar coarse-grained sedimentary facies, but may provide contradictory paleoenvironmental interpretations. The aim of this study is to address this issue, by analysing a set of published 14C ages recovered from wave-built sediment bodies of the Pertuis Charentais (France). Integration of 14C data highlights seven coarse-grained sedimentation pulses (CSPs) that reflect a synchronous increase in wave-induced sediment supply occurring around 2650, 2420, 1240, 970, 800, 650 and 450cal. yr B.P. CSPs can be matched with geochronological data published on other exposed sandy coasts of the western Europe. In first order, CSPs were preserved during phases of decreased storm activity and thus limited coastal erosion in the North Atlantic Ocean from 2700 to 2000 and from 1200 to 600cal. yr B.P. In second order, CSPs occurred during positive NAO and/or negative EA/WR peaks, which are known from previous studies to induce higher waves and to enhance wave-induced sediment transport in the Pertuis Charentais. Chronological boundaries of CSPs could be used as a diagnostic tool to differentiate storm deposits indicative of sudden, episodic very high-energy sedimentation from wave deposits resulting from the sustained action of above-average westerly winds blowing across the North Atlantic Ocean.","Radiocarbon,Teleconnection,Meta-analysis,HSP,Coastal barrier,"
"machine learning for cybersecurity in smart grids: a comprehensive review-based study on methods, solutions, and prospects","2022","In modern Smart Grids (SGs) ruled by advanced computing and networking technologies, condition monitoring relies on secure cyberphysical connectivity. Due to this connection, a portion of transported data, containing confidential information, must be protected as it is vulnerable and subject to several cyber threats. SG cyberspace adversaries attempt to gain access through networking platforms to commit several criminal activities such as disrupting or malicious manipulation of whole electricity delivery process including generation, distribution, and even customer services such as billing, leading to serious damage, including financial losses and loss of reputation. Therefore, human awareness training and software technologies are necessary precautions to ensure the reliability of data traffic and power transmission. By exploring the available literature, it is undeniable that Machine Learning (ML) has become the latest in the timeline and one of the leading artificial intelligence technologies capable of detecting, identifying, and responding by mitigating adversary attacks in SGs. In this context, the main objective of this paper is to review different ML tools used in recent years for cyberattacks analysis in SGs. It also provides important guidelines on ML model selection as a global solution when building an attack predictive model. A detailed classification is therefore developed with respect to data security triad, i.e., Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA) within different types of cyber threats, systems, and datasets. Furthermore, this review highlights the various encountered challenges, drawbacks, and possible solutions as future prospects for ML cybersecurity applications in SGs.","Cybersecurity,Machine learning,Cyberattacks,Model selection,Smart grids,"

"a preliminary study on multi-level biomarkers response of the tropical oyster crassostrea brasiliana to exposure to the antifouling biocide dcoit","2022","This study investigated the sublethal effects of environmentally relevant concentrations of DCOIT on the neotropical oyster Crassostrea brasiliana. Gills and digestive glands of animals exposed to increasing concentrations of DCOIT were analyzed for biochemical, cellular, and histopathological responses. Exposure to DCOIT (0.2 to 151 μg L−1) for 120 h triggered oxidative stress in both tissues (through the modulation of GPX, GST, GSH and GR), which led to damage of membrane lipids (increase of LPO and reduction of the NRRT). DCOIT increased histopathological pathologies in gills, such as necrosis, lymphocyte infiltration and epithelial desquamation. This study showed that short term exposure to environmental concentrations of DCOIT causes negative effects on C. brasiliana at biochemical, physiological, and histological levels. Therefore, the use of DCOIT as a booster biocide in antifouling paints should be further assessed, as it may cause environmental hazards to marine organisms.","Histopathology,Neutral red,Bivalve,Toxicity,Environmental hazard,Sea-nine,"
"the selective extraction of pb and zn in selected mineral and soil samples, application in geochemical exploration (portugal)","1986","The study described herein concerns the application of selective chemical extractions on metal-bearing minerals and soils to geochemical exploration. Specifically, the study addresses itself to the detection of anomalous soils in the vicinity of a mineralized zone. A kinetic study of selectivity of partial chemical extractions-applied to minerals of Pb and Zn was undertaken in order to establish a systematic procedure (reagents, time of extraction, etc.) which could be recommended for the soils of the study area in Portugal. It is shown that: (1) NH4 acetate dissolves smithsonite, willemite, cerussite, anglesite, pyromorphite completely and coronadite, galena, sphalerite only partially; (2) hydroxylamine hydrochloride dissolves coronadite only partially; (3) H2O2 dissolves sphalerite and galena only partially; (4) hot mixed acids dissolve residual galena, sphalerite and coronadite. About 850 soil and gossan samples were collected from two mineralized districts in Portugal, one in a carbonate environment (Portel) and the other in an aluminosilicate zone (Sanguinheiro). For the kinetic study in soil samples from Portel and Sanguinheiro zones, the minus 80 mesh fraction (−180 μm) was submitted to an extraction procedure using the following reagents, in sequence: NH4 acetate, hydroxylamine hydrochloride, NH4 oxalate in darkness, NH4 oxalate under U.V. irradiation and finally strong acids. The mineralogy of the soils from the two areas is different. In the aluminosilicate zone, the products of weathering of sulphide mineralization are mainly anglesite, plumbogummite, amorphous iron oxides, goethite and hematite rich in Pb and Zn. In the carbonate area, the Pb- and Zn-bearing phases generally found in the soil and gossan are Mn oxides, lepidocrocite and hematite. The gossan, in this case, also contains smithsonite and cerussite. In soils from the aluminosilicate zone the use of NH4 oxalate (dark) given a better geochemical response for Pb than NH4 acetate, NH4 oxalate (U.V.) and conventional acid digestion. On the other hand, NH4 oxalate (U.V.) gives better results for Pb and Zn than conventional acid digestion in samples from carbonate area. The analysis of NH4 oxalate (U.V.) extractions, instead of conventional acid digestion, can nevertheless be recommended for both environments.",""

"comparison of detectability of ship wake components between c-band and x-band synthetic aperture radar sensors operating under different slant ranges","2023","The detectability of wake components is affected by influencing parameters, which can be categorized into ship properties, environmental conditions and image acquisition settings. The characteristics of influences of most influencing parameters on the detectability are established. However, a consequent investigation and systematization of influences regarding differences in settings of various SARs have not been published. In this study, data from four different SARs missions, namely TerraSAR–X (TSX), CosmoSkymed (CSK), Sentinel–1 (S1) and RADARSAT–2 (RS2), were collected and analyzed with focus on detectability of ship wake components. The sensors operate on different orbit altitudes and radar frequency bands: TSX and CSK work with X–Band, S1 and RS2 work with C–Band. Using methods from the field of Data Science, the detectability of wake components is modelled for each of the four sensors using machine leaning by the support vector machine (SVM) method. The created SVM-models are then compared in order to derive statements regarding relative detectability of individual wake components. A measure of detectability model’s uncertainty and an alternative analysis based on accumulated backscattering statistics is presented to support the derived statements. In conclusion, sensors with shorter slant ranges and X–Band in comparison to C–Band were found to be better suited for the detection of ship wakes. However, these characteristics only hold for wake components detectable due to the Bragg scattering mechanism, i.e. Kelvin wake arms and V-narrow wakes. No significant difference for near and far field of turbulent wakes is recognized.","Ship wake detection,Synthetic aperture radar,Maritime object detection,Detectability modelling,Machine learning,"
"multi-scale collision risk estimation for maritime traffic in complex port waters","2023","Ship collision risk estimation is an essential component of intelligent maritime surveillance systems. Traditional risk estimation approaches, which can only analyze traffic risk in one specific scale, reveal a significant challenge in quantifying the collision risk of a traffic scenario from different spatial scales. This is detrimental to understanding the traffic situations and supporting effective anti-collision decision-making, particularly as maritime traffic complexity grows and autonomous ships emerge. In this study, a systematic multi-scale collision risk estimation approach is newly developed to capture traffic conflict patterns under different spatial scales. It extends the application of the complex network theory and a node deletion method to quantify the interactions and dependencies among multiple ships within encounter scenarios, enabling collision risk to be evaluated at any spatial scale. Meanwhile, an advanced graph-based clustering framework is introduced to search for the optimal spatial scales for risk evaluation. Extensive numerical experiments based on AIS data in Ningbo_Zhoushan Port are implemented to evaluate the model performance. Experimental results reveal that the proposed approach can strengthen maritime situational awareness, identify high-risk areas and support strategic maritime safety management. This work therefore sheds light on improving the intelligent levels of maritime surveillance and promoting maritime traffic automation.","Intelligent maritime surveillance,Maritime safety,Multi-scale collision risk,Graph clustering,Network theory,"

Primary data was collected from a survey from Chinese pilots working at Shanghai port, and a total of 306 collected surveys was analyzed. The study shows that hazardous attitudes have a significant effect on the safety behavior of maritime pilots, and the degree of risk tolerance plays a significant moderating role in this process. If the value of hazardous attitudes of maritime pilots is higher than an average level, his/her safety operational behavior will gradually degrade with the increased degree of risk tolerance.

"graph signal variation detection: a novel approach for identifying and reconstructing ship ais tangled trajectories","2023","Tangles are a common anomaly in Automatic Identification System (AIS) data, resulting from disorder in time sequences. They increase the spatial complexity of trajectories, making existing methods unable to fully recognize and process them. This will seriously affect the analysis of ship behavior. Furthermore, existing methods often directly remove after recognition, resulting in a significant loss of local information. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an algorithm called Graph Signal Variation Detection (GSVD) to recognize and reconstruct tangles. Initially, data preprocessing is conducted to remove redundant and stationary points. Then, construct the vertices and edges of the graph using indicators integrating AIS data features and ship trajectories, respectively. The tangled region is identified by calculating the total variation theory of the graph. The tangled region is reconstructed using the greedy heuristic, and the optimal reconstruction path is determined by combining total variation quantization. Finally, the GSVD is compared with four prevailing methods, through qualitative and quantitative analyses. The results demonstrate that the GSVD surpasses the other methods in terms of recognition accuracy, recall rates, and false alarm rates. Additionally, the GSVD can effectively reconstruct the tangle.","Total variation,Trajectory preprocessing,Graph signal,AIS data,Greedy algorithm,"
"galernas: a history of coastally trapped disturbances (2003−2020) with hidden frontogenesis in the bay of biscay","2023","Galerna is the term accepted for an abrupt westerly change that affects the north coast of Spain. The wind surge travels from the mid-north coast of Spain to France, generally reaching their maximum intensity at the Basque Coast, and cuts off a period of hot weather, clear skies, and calm conditions at sea. The galernas have a large history of shipwrecks and fishermen deaths. They have been characterized as coastally trapped disturbances (CTD) and their propagation, enhanced with the local formation of a micro-front, was documented to behave like a density current. Alternatively, synoptic fronts have also been reported to cause galernas, considered to be more intense than those generated by a local micro-front. In this article we have generated the first climatology (2003–2020) of these events based on an objective identification methodology. The developed Event Identification Software (EIS), based on both 10-min surface station data and hourly ERA5 reanalysis fields, together with a new Front Identification Scheme (FIS) have enabled a deeper study into the origin and development of these micro-fronts, and a more comprehensive exploration of the interaction of the oceanic fronts entering the Bay of Biscay. Our results show that the area receives an average of four to five relatively intense galernas (Vmax > 50 km h−1) per year. Their number shows a great interannual variability (from one to seven) and a marked seasonality: May and June concentrate the largest fraction (almost one episode each year) and practically no episodes in winter. They occur more frequently between noon and the late afternoon, where the most intense wind records concentrate. Very strong galernas (Vmax > 72 km h−1) have occurred in all 18 years, can happen in any month from February to November, and their monthly distribution does not show the mentioned seasonality. On the contrary, the highest rates of temperature decrease across the galerna front in the coastal stations (−∆T/0.5 h > 4 °C) do have a stronger seasonality, with May and June concentrating a relatively large number of cases with a more abrupt temperature drop. The FIS shows that most of the galernas (83.5%) have a local origin inside the Bay of Biscay, and only a few ones (16.5%) are caused by oceanic fronts initiated out of the region. The local frontogenesis is more frequently initiated by the relatively cold marine southwesterly pre-frontals preceding a parent oceanic front and blowing against the warm continentals inside the Bay of Biscay, after being ducted along the north and northwestern coast of Spain. This hidden local frontogenesis, first revealed by the FIS, seems to be enhanced by the observed lee troughing, which could have both a thermal and dynamic origin, acting simultaneously after the intense Foehn at the coastal strip, preceding the formation of the galerna front. The local front enhancement appears to be the reason for the apparent jump of the primary front, which may eventually weaken, and even disappear, as the galerna front sharpens. Even during the more occasional frontal galernas, directly caused by the westerlies or north-westerlies behind the oceanic front, their eastward propagation is more rapid over the coastal area. The front deforms in shape and may cause its characteristic unexpected/abrupt irruption. All the EIS detected galernas, even the frontal ones, are wind reversals caused by a coastally trapped marine boundary layer. The upper-level ridge over Europe, observed in all of them, seems to be a synoptic ingredient for their development, preventing the eastward propagation of Atlantic depressions and enhancing at the same time the temperature and pressure gradients between the marine and continental air masses.","Bay of Biscay,Galerna,Frontogenesis,Mesofront,Coastally trapped disturbances,"

"accelerated change in the glaciated environments of western canada revealed through trend analysis of optical satellite imagery","2022","The retreat of mountain glaciers affects mountain hazards and hydrology, and new methods are needed to rapidly map glacier retreat at planetary scales. We automatically map 14,329 glaciers (30,063 km2) in British Columbia and Alberta, Canada, from 1984 to 2020 using satellite image archives from the Landsat 4, 5, 7 and 8 missions and reveal an acceleration in area loss that commenced in 2011. Glacier fragmentation, disappearance, and proglacial lake development also accelerated, as did the retreat of glaciers to higher elevations. Our annually-resolved method relies on the existence of previously published and manually validated glacier inventories from the mid-1980s and mid-2000's. Our methods performed well for clean ice glaciers, had occasional errors when proglacial lakes were present, and consistently underestimated the area of debris-covered glaciers. Clean ice glacier area loss accelerated sevenfold between the early [1984–2010] and late [2011−2020] epochs. This acceleration yielded rates of area shrinkage of −49 ± 7 km2 a−1 [early] and − 340 ± 40 km2 a−1 [late] with accelerated losses (32-fold increase) for small glaciers on Vancouver Island over the last decade. Glacier fragmentation accelerated from 26 ± 5.6 fragments a−1 to 88 ± 39 fragments a−1. About 1141 glaciers fell below our 0.05 km2 detection limit and so disappeared from our database, representing a loss of 8%. Proglacial lake area growth accelerated from 9.2 ± 1.1 km2 a−1 to 49 ± 4.5 km2 a−1. We also observed an acceleration in the upwards migration of median glacier elevations for clean ice glaciers from 0.31 ± 0.08 m a−1 to 4.7 ± 0.7 m a−1. Our workflow demonstrates the advantages of annual resolution glacier inventories and contributes towards the implementation of planetary mapping of glaciers and glacier attributes at annual resolution.","Remote sensing,Western Canada,Glacier change,Google Earth Engine,"
"propulsion monitoring system for digitized ship management: preliminary results from a case study","2020","The paradigm of Industry 4.0 a fundamental driver of innovation in marine industry, where the new digital era will see the development of smart cyber-ships equipped with advanced automation systems that will progressively evolve towards fully autonomous vessels. Although the journey towards such technological frontier has started, most companies operating in the maritime sector still appear un-prepared to face the future scenario. In the maritime sector, in fact, empirical models and oversimplified approaches are still largely employed for the management of fleet operations. There is thus the necessity of developing and providing operative models for digitized ship management, which, based on structured information gathering and processing, can provide maritime companies with effective decision support systems in order to strengthen their value chain. This paper focuses on the context of the monitoring of the propulsion system, which is one of the most important systems of a ship and a main source of operation and support costs. A decision support system is presented involving automated data gathering and analysis procedures, to assess the correct functioning of the system and for early-detection of incipient failures. The methodology has been validated through a real case study, and the related results are discussed.","Continuous engine monitoring system,smart ship,industry 4.0,"

"spatio-temporal analysis of aerosol optical depth using rotated empirical orthogonal function over the maritime continent from 2001 to 2020","2022","The deterioration in the annual air quality of the Maritime Continent (MC) is mainly caused by biomass burning haze (BBH) and the surrounding atmospheric conditions. This study aims to investigate the spatial and temporal variations of the aerosol optical depth (AOD) and its relationship with biomass burning and climate anomaly factors in the MC from 2001 to 2020. Using aerosol model reanalysis products from the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA-2), values of the aerosol optical depth (AOD) over the MC were collected and processed to obtain a better understanding of the characteristics of the aerosol loading over the MC. Using the varimax rotated empirical orthogonal function (REOF) approach, we assess the spatio-temporal distributions of the AOD over the MC from 2001 to 2020. The REOF maximized the variances explained for the primary modes and has shown clearer relationship between the spatiotemporal patterns of identified modes. The first three REOF modes of the AOD accounted for a total variance of 73.7%. The first mode (REOF1) explaining 35.8% is the main mode that represent fire burning that concentrated over the 0° latitude. REOF1 represents the emission from burning activities which primarily occurred in the Kalimantan and Sumatra based on their correlation with the total hotspots, which reach 0.73, which a certain extent of correlation with the climate anomalies, including El Niño, positive DM, and their coincidence. The second (REOF2) also explaining 35.8% represents the AOD distribution influenced by the biomass burning emission transported from the Indochina in the area to the north of 5°N which has an opposite mode with the general mode in MC except for Java area. Meanwhile, PC3 AOD has reduced to 2.2% in the rotation process and represent the influence of monsoon movement on the AOD level. In short, the study highlights spatial and temporal AOD distribution and the phenomena of burning mass and climate indices in the long-term MERRA reanalysis dataset to allow more understanding of the causal links of AOD in MC to the climate features.","Indian ocean dipole,Aerosol optical depth,El Niño southern oscillation,Maritime continent,"

"high-squint sar imaging of maritime ship targets","2022","High-squint synthetic aperture radar (HS-SAR) imaging technology greatly enhances the flexibility of SAR. However, the existing HS-SAR imaging algorithms are generally based on the assumption that the illuminated target is static during the synthetic aperture formation. As a consequence, the state-of-the-art algorithms are unable to focus on moving targets well, thus leading to displaced and blurred images of the targets. A maritime ship is a typical kind of moving target with complex noncooperative motion, which has received much attention. Thus, it is a difficult but valuable issue to study HS-SAR imaging of ship targets. In this work, the influence of ship translation and fluctuation is theoretically analyzed. On the basis of these analyses, the new conception of â€œthird range compression (TRC)â€ caused by ship translation is proposed, and the squint minimization (SM) operation is implemented for the compensation of TRC. Moreover, considering that the target Doppler parameters induced by ship fluctuation are related to its position, a novel method called WASH-CLEAN (watershed and CLEAN) is proposed to automatically focus ship scattering points with different swings. Finally, we propose an integrated modified range-Doppler (RD) imaging algorithm by combining the advantages of HS-SAR and inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR). The simulation results show the validity and effectiveness of the presented method.","ISAR,high-squint SAR imaging,synthetic aperture formation,TRC,HS-SAR imaging algorithms,Chirp,high-squint synthetic aperture radar,maritime ship target,target Doppler parameters,modified range-Doppler (RD) algorithm,blurred images,Marine vehicles,illuminated target,squint minimization operation,inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR),ships,maritime ship targets,ship translation,synthetic aperture radar,radar imaging,Sea state,Doppler effect,WASH-CLEAN,Azimuth,Doppler radar,Radar imaging,ship scattering points,Imaging,High-squint synthetic aperture radar (HS-SAR),ship fluctuation,third range compression,integrated modified range-Doppler imaging algorithm,inverse synthetic aperture radar,"
"estimating the effect of decision deviation spreading in networked synergetic emergency decision-making environment: a case study on maritime accident disposition","2019","The generation and propagation of human error will have a great impact on the decision-making in emergency environment. The analysis of the model and mechanism of human error and its propagation is of great significance to the study of emergency decision-making. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a decision failure model based on confidence rule (BRB) reasoning. Individual decision-making is taken as a node in workflow, and the network workflow among decision-making units is examined in a larger scope by establishing the interactive network between nodes. On this basis, the control model of human decision-making errors is further constructed, including the accumulation, transmission and correction of decision-making errors. Finally, taking maritime emergency rescue as an example, this paper studies the capability of the fault control model to identify and correct faults in the decision-making workflow. The research shows that the model can describe the degree of decision deviation of the decision-making unit, and reflect the control and correction function of the decision workflow on the decision error to some extent.","workflow,marine accidents,maritime accident disposition,Transportation,emergency management,decision failure model,Marine vehicles,networked synergetic emergency decision-making environment,confidence rule reasoning,Organizations,human factors,decision deviation,Decision making,interactive network,Accidents,decision-making workflow,maritime emergency rescue,decision making,fault control model,human error,decision error,human decision-making errors,human error control,fault tolerant control,Belief rule base,Cognition,Task analysis,maritime decision-making,marine control,"
"a task offloading scheme in maritime edge computing network","2023","Maritime communication network is affected by many factors such as meteorological environment, resource constraints, communication distance, and so on, resulting in task packet loss, failure, and node overload when the task is offloaded and executed.

Considering the characteristic of the ship, we analyze ship position and network connectivity, and the ship motion model is constructed. The task offloading link formed with ship as node. With delay and energy consumption as constraints, the revenue function for task offloading path is designed. The function comprehensively considers network resources, channel transmission and node execution ability, thereby achieving the reliable task offloading.

"inter-annual variability of net ecosystem productivity for a temperate mixed forest: a predominance of carry-over effects?","2018","This study presents twenty years of Net Ecosystem Productivity estimations obtained using eddy covariance in a mixed forest, dominated by beech with sparse conifers, at the Vielsalm station, in the Belgian Ardennes. First the quality and reliability of the data set is discussed. An uncertainty analysis showed that if, on one hand, the site heterogeneity and set-up changes may strongly affect yearly NEP estimates, questioning thus the total carbon budget relevance, on the other hand, robust inter-annual anomalies may be obtained as long as a site dedicated data treatment is carefully applied. A validation of the anomalies by comparison with a growth index derived from tree ring measurements is given. The resulting anomalies (range: [−206; + 123] g C m−2 yr−1, standard deviation: 93 g C m−2 yr−1) being larger than their own uncertainty (∼30 g C m−2 yr−1), an inter-annual variability analysis is possible. This analysis shows that the sources of NEP inter-annual variability at the Vielsalm station are multiple but the most prominent causes are biotic processes driven by carry-over effects of preceding meteorological events. The lowest observed NEP, in 2000, resulted from a bark beetle attack probably prompted by an early frost event in 1998. Besides, the robust lagged correlation between NEP anomalies and mean vapor pressure deficit during the preceding vegetation season also suggests a carry-over effect of water limitation during the previous year on the beech NEP. Mechanisms driving this carry-over effect are supposedly linked to tree physiology, which is confirmed by a dependency of canopy photosynthetic capacity to previous year water limitation. Some hypotheses, involving biomass allocation and bud formation, are proposed to explain its lagged impact on canopy photosynthetic capacity. Other causes of NEP inter-annual variability are the radiation during the current vegetation season and the temperature at the end of the winter but the latter variable rather indicates an effect on the conifers interspersed in the plot. Overall, the photosynthetic capacity combined with these two factors explained about 75% of NEP inter-annual variability.","Eddy covariance,Net Ecosystem Productivity,Interannual variability,Forest ecosystem,"

"diamond exploration from the bottom up: regional geophysical signatures of lithosphere conditions favorable for diamond exploration","1995","On a local scale, regional geophysical trends may be used to locate the sites of volcanism which transports diamonds to the surface. By studying the conditions under which carbon is stable as diamond, a new regional geophysical exploration philosophy is espoused based upon the search for lithospheric conditions favorable to diamond genesis and preservation. Surface heat flow values of less than 40–45 mW m−2 and lithospheric thicknesses of greater than 150 km meet these target conditions. An analysis of two-dimensional thermal heterogeneities in the lithosphere indicates that target areas should have low surface heat flow over an areas of at least 300 to 400 km diameter. In addition to having low surface heat flow, such target regions are likely to be characterized by a large depth to the Curie Point isotherm, relatively great depths to lithospheric electrical conductors, slow seismic velocities, and great depths to the seismic low velocity zone. The region is likely to be characterized by a paucity of seismicity with high maximum hypocentral depths. The primary problem with these techniques in regional diamond exploration is that they provide information about modern lithospheric structure. Changes in lithospheric structure through time may be detected as elevation changes. These conditions are most commonly found in regions of Archean and Early Proterozoic lithosphere, and are consistent with Clifford's Rule, an empirical diamond exploration strategy. The restriction of these conditions to these ancient terrains may be associated with special conditions required to form these terrains which only existed early in Earth history, or with an increase in the thermal heterogeneity of the lithosphere through time which results in, on average, thinner lithosphere in younger terrains.",""
"extreme precipitation in the netherlands: an event attribution case study","2018","Attributing the change in likelihood of extreme weather events, particularly those occurring at small spatiotemporal scales, to anthropogenic forcing is a key challenge in climate science. While a warmer world is associated with an increase in atmospheric moisture on a global scale, the impact on the magnitude of extreme precipitation episodes has substantial regional variability. Analysis of individual cases is important in understanding the extent of these changes on spatial scales relevant to stakeholders. Here, we present a probabilistic attribution analysis of the extreme precipitation that fell in large parts of the Netherlands on 28 July 2014. Using a step-by-step approach, we aim to identify changes in intensity and likelihood of such an event as a result of anthropogenic global warming while highlighting the challenges in performing robust event attribution on high-impact precipitation events that occur at small scales. A method based on extreme value theory is applied to observational data in addition to global and regional climate model ensembles that pass a robust model evaluation process. Results based on observations suggest a strong and significant increase in the intensity and frequency of a 2014-type event as a result of anthropogenic climate change but trends in the model ensembles used are considerably smaller. Our results are communicated alongside considerable uncertainty, highlighting the difficulty in attributing events of this nature.

"spatio-temporal reconstruction of snow avalanche activity using dendrogeomorphological approach in bucegi mountains romanian carpathians","2014","Snow avalanches cause damage to tourism infrastructure and loss of human life. In mountain areas where snow avalanches are less scientifically documented, the dendrogeomorphological approach is the best way for snow–avalanche activity reconstruction and to investigate the magnitude and frequency of the avalanches. Our study was conducted in the Bucegi Mountains located in the eastern part of the Southern Carpathians (Romanian Carpathians) in the Sinaia ski area, the most important ski area in the Romanian Carpathians. The mountains are characterised by high elevations of over 2400–2500m, a harsh climate (−2.5°C mean annual air temperature above 2500masl, over 130days with snowfall on average, over 185days with deep snow on average and 10–12months with a snow layer). Snow avalanche activity is marked by tilted trunks, scars and broken trees. Therefore, we applied the dendrogeomorphological approach. We performed a dendrogeomorphic analysis based on 66 Picea abies and 48 Larix decidua Mill. We sampled trees in two snow avalanche tracks, 43 in one and 71 in the other, and obtained 86 and 142 samples, respectively. Our results from tree-ring records yielded 32 snow avalanche winters in the 1963–2011 chronology in one track and 27 snow avalanche winters in the 1963–2012 chronology in the other track. Thus, we obtained important information about the spatial and temporal characteristics of snow avalanche activity. The small and medium snow avalanches cover the central and lateral parts of the stands, whilst the large snow avalanches reach the runout zone of the stands. We dated past snow avalanches and obtained a return period ranging from 13.7 to 15.2years. The analysis revealed that 14 winters had an activity index over 10% 4 winters had an activity index over 20% in the first avalanche track, 10 winters had an activity index over 10% and 4 winters had an activity index over 20% in the second avalanche track. On the other hand, to determine the relationship between snow avalanches and winter temperatures we use the Winter Standardized Index (WSI) between 1963 and 2012. We obtained a correlation between these parameters and our dendrogeomorphological results; the probability of major snow avalanche occurrence was highest during cold winters.","Norway spruce (),European larch ( Mill.),Dendrogeomorphological approach,Bucegi Mountains,Romanian Carpathians,Snow avalanche,"
"induction machine bearing faults detection based on a multi-dimensional music algorithm and maximum likelihood estimation","2016","Condition monitoring of electric drives is of paramount importance since it contributes to enhance the system reliability and availability. Moreover, the knowledge about the fault mode behavior is extremely important in order to improve system protection and fault-tolerant control. Fault detection and diagnosis in squirrel cage induction machines based on motor current signature analysis (MCSA) has been widely investigated. Several high resolution spectral estimation techniques have been developed and used to detect induction machine abnormal operating conditions. This paper focuses on the application of MCSA for the detection of abnormal mechanical conditions that may lead to induction machines failure. In fact, this paper is devoted to the detection of single-point defects in bearings based on parametric spectral estimation. A multi-dimensional MUSIC (MD MUSIC) algorithm has been developed for bearing faults detection based on bearing faults characteristic frequencies. This method has been used to estimate the fundamental frequency and the fault related frequency. Then, an amplitude estimator of the fault characteristic frequencies has been proposed and fault indicator has been derived for fault severity measurement. The proposed bearing faults detection approach is assessed using simulated stator currents data, issued from a coupled electromagnetic circuits approach for air-gap eccentricity emulating bearing faults. Then, experimental data are used for validation purposes.","Maximum likelihood estimation,Signal processing,Bearing fault detection,Induction machine,Condition monitoring,MD MUSIC,"
"non-corresponding contaminants in marine surface sediments as a factor of args spread in the sea of azov","2022","The present study aims to analyze the level and total toxicity of the most common pollutants in surface sediments and assess their impact on the occurrence of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in the Sea of Azov. Biotesting using the whole-cell bacterial lux-biosensors showed high integral toxicity of surface sediments and the presence of genotoxicants and substances that cause oxidative stress and protein damage. Using cluster analysis, it was shown that the distribution of pollutants in the Sea of Azov depends on the type of surface sediments. The relative abundance and distribution of 14 ARGs in surface sediments were shown. Principle component analyses results suggest that non-corresponding contaminants do not exert direct influence on the ARGs abundance in the surface sediments of the Sea of Azov. Thus, the need to investigate the significance of non-corresponding pollutants in the selection and distribution of ARGs in the aquatic environment remains a pressing problem.","Polychlorinated biphenyls,Radionuclides,Organochlorine pesticides,Potentially toxic elements,Sediment pollution,Antibiotic resistance genes,"

"observing and understanding the southeast asian aerosol system by remote sensing: an initial review and analysis for the seven southeast asian studies (7seas) program","2013","Southeast Asia (SEA) hosts one of the most complex aerosol systems in the world, with convoluted meteorological scales, sharp geographic and socioeconomic features, high biological productivity, mixtures of a wide range of atmospheric pollutants, and likely a significant susceptibility to global climate change. This physical complexity of SEA is coupled with one of the world's most challenging environments for both in situ and remote sensing observation. The 7-Southeast Asian Studies (7SEAS) program was formed to facilitate interdisciplinary research into the integrated SEA aerosol environment via grass roots style collaboration. In support of the early 7SEAS program and the affiliated Southeast Asia Composition, Cloud, Climate Coupling Regional Study (SEAC4RS), this review was created to outline the network of connections linking aerosol particles in SEA with meteorology, climate and the total earth system. In this review, we focus on and repeatedly link back to our primary data source: satellite aerosol remote sensing and associated observability issues. We begin with a brief rationale for the program, outlining key aerosol impacts and, comparing their magnitudes to the relative uncertainty of observations. We then discuss aspects of SEA's physical, socio-economic and biological geography relevant to meteorology and observability issues associated with clouds and precipitation. We show that not only does SEA pose significant observability challenges for aerosol particles, but for clouds and precipitation as well. With the fundamentals of the environment outlined, we explore SEA's most studied aerosol issue: biomass burning. We summarize research on bulk aerosol properties for SEA, including a short synopsis of recent AERONET observations. We describe long range transport patterns. Finally, considerable attention is paid to satellite aerosol observability issues, with a face value comparison of common aerosol products in the region including passive and active aerosol products as well as fluxes. We show that satellite data products diverge greatly due to a host of known artifacts. These artifacts have important implications for how research is conducted, and care must be taken when using satellite products to study aerosol problems. The paper ends with a discussion of how the community can approach this complex and important environment.","Southeast Asia,Air Pollution,Biomass Burning,Aerosol,Meteorology,Remote Sensing,Maritime Continent,"

We analyze data captured by our novel airborne Multi-channel SAR (MSAR) system that is particularly suited to sampling the velocity profile of scatterers in the maritime environment. While previous works have shown the utility MSAR systems for correcting scene motion induced blurring artifacts, our work shows, for the first time, how the information furnished by an MSAR system can systematically render accurate classification of maritime scenes into different perceptual categories. We offer a methodology that is superior to traditional classification techniques that are based purely on the spatial structure of an image.

"wave height prediction suitable for maritime transportation based on green ocean of things","2023","Nowadays, the application fields of the Internet of Things (IoT) involve all aspects. This article combines ocean research with the IoT, in order to investigate the wave height prediction to assist ships to improve the economy and safety of maritime transportation and proposes an ocean IoT Green Ocean of Things (GOoT) with a green and low-carbon concept. In the wave height prediction, we apply a hybrid model (EMD-TCN) combining the temporal convolutional network (TCN) and the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) to the buoy observation data. We then compare it with TCN, long short-term memory (LSTM), and hybrid model EMD-LSTM. By testing the data of eight selected NDBC buoys distributed in different sea areas, the effectiveness of the EMD-TCN hybrid model in wave height prediction is verified. The hysteresis problem in previous wave height prediction research is eliminated, while improving the accuracy of the wave height prediction. In the 24 h, 36 h, and 48 h wave height prediction, the minimum mean absolute errors are 0.1265, 0.1689, and 0.1963, respectively; the maximum coefficient of determination are 0.9388, 0.9019, and 0.8712, respectively.

The proposed algorithm aims at selecting the most appropriate radar mode, if applicable the most appropriate platform altitude and horizontal position by analyzing the sea clutter. The analysis of the environment and then the inference of a more favorable mode of operation are based on the adjustment of the measurements to environment models, in particular clutter models. Another way to improve detection performance is the introduction of external knowledge in processing (Knowledge-Aided processing).

Variations in concentrations of BT in the two ballast tanks corresponded well with the level of BT contamination in different pumping sites of ballast waters. Concentrations of BT species detected in ballast water were rather consistent with those found in port waters and sediment of Taiwan and Japan.

"botnet detection based on traffic behavior analysis and flow intervals","2013","Botnets represent one of the most serious cybersecurity threats faced by organizations today. Botnets have been used as the main vector in carrying many cyber crimes reported in the recent news. While a significant amount of research has been accomplished on botnet analysis and detection, several challenges remain unaddressed, such as the ability to design detectors which can cope with new forms of botnets. In this paper, we propose a new approach to detect botnet activity based on traffic behavior analysis by classifying network traffic behavior using machine learning. Traffic behavior analysis methods do not depend on the packets payload, which means that they can work with encrypted network communication protocols. Network traffic information can usually be easily retrieved from various network devices without affecting significantly network performance or service availability. We study the feasibility of detecting botnet activity without having seen a complete network flow by classifying behavior based on time intervals. Using existing datasets, we show experimentally that it is possible to identify the presence of existing and unknown botnets activity with high accuracy even with very small time windows.","Intrusion detection,Botnet,Network flows,Traffic behavior analysis,Machine learning,"

Samples were collected from three sites in summer (May 1997) and winter (January 1998) along a transect from an unvegetated Creek Bank through a vegetated Tidal Levee to the vegetated midmarsh with evident lateral heterogeneity caused by hydrologic regime, macrophytes and microbial and macrofaunal activities. A suite of trace metals (As, Ba, Cr, Co, Cu, Cd, Mo, Ni, Pb, Th, Ti, U, V, Zn and Zr) was analyzed to obtain their depth-distribution at the three sites. Spatially marked differences were observed, that were primarily related to hydraulic flushing of trace metals away from the sites in high-energy regimes, rapid downward mixing and reworking of sediment via bioturbation, and below-ground degradation and production of Spartina biomass. Although sulfate reduction and the formation of acid volatile sulfide and pyrite were dominant processes throughout the marsh, the trace metal scavenging role of sulfides was not apparent. However, possible sulfurization of organic matter, leading to enhanced trapping of trace metals with organic carbon, may have played an important role in sequestration of trace metals. No similarity was observed visually between the depth trends of trace metals and sediment properties (grain size, iron-oxyhydroxide content, acid volatile sulfides and pyrite content) that are known to play a major role in trace metal partitioning. Only organic carbon content closely followed the trace metal profiles at all the three sites. Minor variation in depth-integrated sediment trace metal content was observed seasonally at each of the three sites. Furthermore, the depth trend of profiles of individual trace metals also did not vary significantly over the seasons either.","early diagenesis,trace metals,saltmarsh,porewater,trace metal cycling,"
"gis-based simulation methodology for evaluating ship encounters probability to improve maritime traffic safety","2019","Evaluating ship encounters probability efficiently is significant for maritime transportation risk analysis as well as improving maritime traffic safety.

"impact of the covid-19 pandemic on urban human mobility - a multiscale geospatial network analysis using new york bike-sharing data","2022","The COVID-19 pandemic breaking out at the end of 2019 has seriously impacted urban human mobility and poses great challenges for traffic management and urban planning. An understanding of this influence from multiple perspectives is urgently needed. In this study, we propose a multiscale geospatial network framework for the analysis of bike-sharing data, aiming to provide a new perspective for the exploration of the pandemic impact on urban human mobility. More specifically, we organize the bike-sharing data into a network representation, and divide the network into a three-scale structure, ranging from the whole bike system at the macroscale, to the network community at the mesoscale and then to the bicycle station at the microscale. The spatiotemporal analysis of bike-sharing data at each scale is combined with visualization methods for an intuitive understanding of the patterns. We select New York City, one of the most seriously influenced city by the pandemic, as the study area, and used Citi Bike bike-sharing data from January to April in 2019 and 2020 in this area for the investigation. The analysis results show that with the development of the pandemic, the riding flow and its spatiotemporal distribution pattern changed significantly, which had a series of effects on the use and management of bikes in the city. These findings may provide useful references during the pandemic for various stakeholders, e.g., citizens for their travel planning, bike-sharing companies for bicycle dispatching and bicycle disinfection management, and governments for traffic management.","Bike-sharing data,Multiscale spatiotemporal analysis,Urban mobility,COVID-19,Geospatial network,"
"health risk assessment in maritime operations and ship design: a framework for addressing health-related risks in the context of maritime safety assessment","2023","Large passenger vessels, such as Cruise and RoPax vessels, can be extremely vulnerable to communicable diseases, as the COVID-19 pandemic has shown lately in addition to earlier health events related to other viruses and diseases. Thus, managing major disease outbreaks in the maritime industry constitutes a big challenge, aiming to address the significant risks arising from an uncontrolled spreading, either through risk controls for maritime operations or alternatives for ship design. To answer this challenge, this paper introduces health aspects into maritime safety assessment, considering the daily risk management from shipping companies, the IMOâ€™s Formal Safety Assessment (FSA) and the Risk-Based Design (RBD) framework. Health risk assessment is incorporated into the framework in terms of major outbreaks, regarding both their probability of occurrence and consequences. The result is a structured and formalised procedure based on the process of IMOâ€™s FSA, and built according to the standards of RBD. The framework, with a suitable risk metric, should be capable of assessing health-related risks and risk control options, by also considering cost-efficiency and other criteria in a holistic assessment.

"dynamic effective connectivity network based on change points detection","2022","Human brain networks can be modeled as a system of interconnected brain regions which are recorded by time-dependent observations with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In order to spot trends, detect anomalies, and interpret the temporal dynamics, it is essential to understand the connections among distinct brain regions, and how these connections evolve over time. However, the change points of dynamic reorganization in brain connectivity are unknown, which may occur frequently during the scanning session. In this paper, we introduce a fused lasso regression approach to detect the number and position of rapid connectivity changes of subject and subsequently estimate the brain effective connectivity networks within each state phase lying between consecutive change points by conditional Granger causality method from fMRI time series data. The performance of the method is verified via numerical simulations and the obtained classification accuracy with support vector machine (SVM) was 86.24% in 140 subjects from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Compared with static EC model and conventional dynamic EC model based on sliding window technique, the experimental results show that the fused lasso achieved better classification effect, which probably due to better dynamic description. The result shows that the dynamic effective connectivity based on change points detected by fused lasso method is a better feature for classification.","Alzheimer’s disease (AD),Dynamic brain connectivity,Granger causality analysis,Change points detection,Fused lasso regression,"
"spatio-temporal variability of sea surface temperature in irish waters (1982–2015) using avhrr sensor","2017","Temporal and spatial variability of Sea Surface Temperature (SST), a key variable linked to climate change, was analysed using a continuous 34-year time series of Advanced Very-High-Resolution radiometer (AVHRR) data (1982–2015). The climatological analysis showed a significant latitudinal SST gradient; waters were warmer in the south and colder in the north. A seasonal effect was evident, with lowest SST values in March and highest SST in August. Results suggest that the temporal and spatial variability in Irish waters is mainly related to the Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation (AMO) and the warming from anthropogenic CO2 emissions. Overall, the warming trend was significant (p-value of ≤0.05) and positive (0.26°Cdecade−1) for the whole study area. However, this trend was not spatially homogeneous and varied between the International Council for the Exploration of the Seas (ICES) Divisions, having the most significant positive trends in the north (VIa, VIb, VIIb and VIIc) and east (VIId and VIIe).

"aerosols optical and radiative properties in indonesia based on aeronet version 3","2022","Heterogeneity in seasonal aerosol types due to different sources, local characteristics, and meteorology lead to different optical and radiative properties from one place to another. This study analyzes the long-term averages of aerosol optical and radiative properties obtained by the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) version 3 at four sites in Indonesia representing fire prone areas (Palangka Raya, Pontianak, Jambi: 2012–2020), and urban-industrial (Bandung: 2009–2018). We examined the seasonal variation of aerosol optical depth (AOD), Angstrom Exponent (AE), Precipitable Water Vapor (PWV), and Single Scattering Albedo (SSA) combined with meteorological parameters at these Indonesian sites. Multiple clustering techniques from different relationships among various aerosol optical and radiative parameters was employed to further study the aerosol type in respect to different seasonality. The results exhibited a distinct seasonal pattern at all sites except Bandung, whereas AOD increased owing to forest and peat fire outbreaks during the dry season. The trend in AOD annual depicts an increase in Bandung as emission from urban/industrial increases episodically, while it depicts a decrease at the three biomass burning sites. As AOD increased, Palangka Raya, Pontianak, and Jambi exhibited wider ranges of observed AE (1.2–1.8) and high FMF (>0.8) in the dry burning period (June to October). On the other hand, Bandung has more aerosol distribution in the range of FMF values 0.6–1 and AE 1–1.6, compared with other sites, suggesting contribution of complex aerosol emission from different sources and likely due to the formation of secondary aerosol production from trace gases. Palangka Raya, Pontianak, and Jambi exhibited non-absorbing characteristics, as indicated by high SSA (>0.95), high FMF, and high EAE values (1.2–1.7) with no discrepancy in seasonal patterns, implying that biomass burning aerosols in Indonesia tend to cool the atmosphere with strong scattering rather than absorbing. At Bandung, aerosols mixed with slightly absorbing and non-absorbing aerosols owing to urban and industrial emissions. This study lays a foundation for further research on the contribution of aerosol radiative forcing to climate within the complex aerosol and cloud environments in Indonesia.","AERONET,Absorbing aerosol,Indonesia,Aerosol optical depth,Single Scattering Albedo,"
"contaminants in two west greenland caribou populations","2016","Two caribou populations in West Greenland were sampled and the kidneys, liver and muscle analyzed for contaminants, including aluminum, arsenic, cadmium, copper, lead, mercury, selenium and zinc. Although close in proximity, the two populations are topographically separated by an ice cap, which creates different climates and vegetation types in each region. Contaminant levels reflected the differing diets of the two caribou populations. To the south in the wetter lichen-rich region, caribou had significantly more aluminum, arsenic, cadmium, lead, mercury, selenium and zinc, likely due to atmospheric deposition on lichens. To the north in the dry desert steppe where grasses predominate, caribou had higher levels of copper. Cows collected in late winter had significantly less hepatic copper, lead and mercury if pregnant, indicating placental transfer of these elements. Our results suggest that hepatic copper levels <200μgg−1 dry weight may result in copper depletion in pregnant cows and hepatic mercury concentrations above 0.5μgg−1 dry weight may negatively affect fertility in caribou cows. Hepatic mercury levels were negatively correlated with cow body weight, suggesting an adverse effect on body condition. Element concentrations found in tissues from these caribou are not considered to be of a health concern for those consuming this traditional food.","Copper,Lead,Selenium,Mercury,Cadmium,Caribou,"

However, this is a complicated problem under various encounter situations, some of which are very complex. In order to quantify the collision risk in real operating conditions, a novel risk-informed collision risk awareness approach is proposed for real-time operating conditions. Firstly, the ship's actions are identified based on the Automatic Identification System (AIS) data. Secondly, the uncertainty of ship action patterns is analyzed by regarding the target ships as velocity obstacles. Then, the collision risk model is utilized to assess the collision risk level based on the uncertainty in the non-linear velocity obstacles algorithm considering responsibility. Finally, some case studies are carried out based on the proposed model. In the model, the dynamic and uncertainty features of the ship action dynamics in real operating conditions are considered, which could benefit on reducing ship collision accidents and improving the development of technologies on intelligent collision avoidance decision makings.","Ship collision,COLREGs,Velocity obstacles,Real time risk awareness,Automatic Identification System,"

"multi-armed bandits learning for task offloading in maritime edge intelligence networks","2022","In the context of complex and dynamic marine environment, the offloading of computing tasks for ships of Internet of Things (IoT) users is a very challenging problem considering the different quality of service (QoS) requirements of maritime applications. Mobile edge computing driven by powerful computing capability and edge intelligence is taken as a promising solution, especially for the resource-constrained and delay-sensitive maritime IoT users. In this paper, we study the optimal edge server selection problem for ship IoT users to jointly minimize the latency and energy consumption for task offloading. Specifically, we first propose a novel space-air-ground-edge (SAGE) integrated maritime network architecture to offload computation-intensive IoT services at sea. Then, the latency and energy consumption of data transmission and processing during offloading are modelled. Based on the models, the edge server selection problem is formulated into a Multi-Armed Bandits learning problem, with considering the task latency requirement and energy budget. To achieve the optimal solution, a novel algorithm, referred to as UCB1-ESSS, is developed, which links the latency, energy consumption, and network constraints by introducing both reward and cost. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve considerably lower offloading latency and weighted latency-energy cost compared with the traditional algorithms under different QoS requirements, which proves the efficacy of theproposed algorithm.","edge intelligence,multi-armed bandits,resource-constrained,dynamic marine environment,data transmission,Internet of Things,Energy consumption,quality of service,Marine vehicles,Delays,ship IoT users,maritime edge intelligence networks,task latency requirement,powerful computing capability,energy budget,Things users,Servers,marine ship IoT users,cloud computing,MultiArmed Bandits,latency-energy cost,optimisation,mobile computing,mobile edge computing,network constraints,Computing offloading,computation-intensive IoT services,considerably lower offloading latency,maritime applications,complex environment,task offloading,energy consumption,optimal edge server selection problem,delay-sensitive maritime IoT users,computational complexity,maritime wireless networks,Computational modeling,optimal solution,Task analysis,Internet,learning (artificial intelligence),resource allocation,service requirements,novel space-air-ground-edge integrated maritime network architecture,"
"understanding global spatio-temporal trends and the relationship between vegetation greenness and climate factors by land cover during 1982–2014","2020","Analysis of the correlation between vegetation greenness and climate variable trends is important in the study of vegetation greenness. Our study used Normalized Difference Vegetation Index-3rd generation data from the Advanced Very High-Resolution Radiometer - Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies (AVHRR-GIMMS NDVI3g), land cover data from the Climate Change Initiative (CCI-LC), and climate data from the Climatic Research Unit global time series (CRU TS) of climate variables (temperature and precipitation, solar radiation) over the past 33 years. First, we estimated the overall trends for vegetation greenness and climate variables over five time periods. Second, we subjected the data to correlation, regression, and residual analyses to detect correlations between vegetation greenness and different climate variables. Third, we extracted trends and correlation results by primary land cover types for each climate zone. Our study was focused at the global scale, and findings indicate that the largest decreasing trend of vegetation greenness and grasslands occurred in the mid-latitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere and in parts of South America, Africa, Saudi Arabia, and south and northeast Asia. In particular, the cold climatic zones of forest (36.6%), cropland (36.6%), and grassland (14.1%) suffered significant decline in vegetation greenness. Anthropogenic activities are mainly responsible for declining vegetation greenness particularly in northern Africa, central and western Asia. However, residual analysis shows an increase in vegetation greenness in some parts of western Europe, southern Australia, and the northern part of South America. The study also identified temperature and precipitation as the main factors responsible for controlling vegetation growth. Hot-spot areas with the largest temperature increases were found in the Amazon, Central America, southern Greenland, east Africa, south-east Asia, and other areas. However, temperatures decreased in the western part of South America, Angola, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Papua New Guinea. Precipitation decreased the most from March to May over most parts of the world with high correlation (r = 0.88) in Russia Canada, northeast Asia, and central Africa. In general, climate factors were the principal drivers of the variation in vegetation greenness globally in recent years.","Vegetation greenness trends,Land cover,Correlation,Precipitation,Global,Temperature,"
"motion primitives learning of ship-ship interaction patterns in encounter situations","2022","Understanding the ship encounter situations is a tough task, since the uncertain motions of encountering ships and the long-lasting frequent interactions make the encounter processes dynamic and stochastic. If we can decompose these complex encounter processes into motion primitives, which represent the elementary interaction patterns, an encounter can be more easily understood and identified. In this study, we propose a two-stream Long Short-Term Memory-based autoencoder (LSTM-based AE) approach to extract motion primitives from multi-dimensional encounter data without specific rules and prior knowledge. This approach leverages the sequential representation ability of LSTM to learn the temporal dependencies of each encountering ship motion. Then, we developed a fusion gate named dynamic artificial potential field (DAPF) to fuse the outputs of two LSTMs and generated the high-level representation needed to capture the spatiotemporal relationships of the interactions. After that, through a clustering method, the motion primitives were automatically extracted to describe various interaction patterns. The effectiveness of this approach was validated by naturalistic encounter data. The low reconstruction errors of the LSTM-based AE demonstrated that high-level representations captured the relationships of the interactions in both temporal and spatial dimensions. Case studies demonstrated that the utilization of motion primitives provided a semantically interpretable technique to analyze the interaction patterns and encounter process, which is conducive to situation awareness and decision-making for developing intelligent ships.","Motion primitives,Representation learning,Encounter situation,Two-stream LSTM,Ship-ship interaction,"
"review of maritime shipping networks research in the context of the belt and road initiative","2021","Since the initiation of the â€œSilk Road Economic Belt and the 21st-century Maritime Silk Roadâ€ (B&R) by the Chinese government in 2013, the interconnection among different transport modes (e.g. rail transport, road transport, and maritime transport) has become closer.

"implications of the ban on organotins for protection of global coastal and marine ecology","2009","Organotin-based antifouling paints are highly effective against most fouling organisms, and their application results in a large amount of savings for the shipping industry. On the other hand, TBT (tributyltin) in antifouling paints is described as the most toxic substance ever introduced into the marine environment. Consequential environmental impacts of TBT led to its regulation in many countries, although concerns were raised regarding the complete prohibition of organotin-based compounds in antifouling paints. Serious concerns were also raised regarding the complete banning of organotins. After long deliberations, the AFS Convention (convention to control the use of harmful antifouling systems on ships) was adopted on 5 October 2001. The Convention, which prohibits the use of harmful organotins in antifouling paints used on ships, will enter into force on 17 September 2008. In view of the concerns raised against the prohibition of organotin-based compounds in antifouling paints, this paper focuses on a review of the AFS Convention, with a gap analysis on the difficulties in implementation of the Convention. It also offers some recommendations for improved policies.","Regulations,Environmental impacts,Organotin-based antifouling paints,Implications,AFS Convention,TBT,"
"the 19 january 2013 windstorm over the north atlantic: large-scale dynamics and impacts on iberia","2014","On 19 January 2013 Portugal was once again on an extreme meteorological risk warning state due to the landfall of a rapidly deepening low pressure system exactly on the period of its maximum explosive development. This storm, named Gong, had a central minimum pressure of 968hPa, observed wind gusts of 140kmh−1 on some locations of the Portuguese coast and was responsible for the downfall of thousands of trees on some of the Portuguese national forests, the destruction of several hundred farms among other huge socioeconomic losses and fatalities. The large-scale synoptic conditions and dynamical characteristics of windstorm Gong, as well as the associated meteorological and socioeconomic adverse impacts are reviewed in this paper. For this purpose an objective lagrangean method, which identifies and follows individual lows, is applied for the assessment of the cyclone track and lifetime characteristics, which is complemented by the analysis of several thermohydrodynamical reanalysis fields during the lifetime of the cyclone. Results show that Gong underwent an explosive development with ‘bomb’ characteristics between the Azores and the Iberian Peninsula, with a deepening rate unusually high for these latitudes. The rapid deepening of Gong was supported by the southerly displacement of the polar jet stream; by a pronounced cyclonic potential vorticity streamer which approached Iberia from northwest; and by the presence of an atmospheric river over the western and central subtropical North Atlantic converging into Gong׳s genesis region and then crossing the Atlantic basin, moving along with the storm towards Iberia. Understanding the dynamics of these high impact extreme events may be of relevance in view of improving extreme forecasts as well as of public awareness, policy making and risk assessment and management of severe weather in Portugal.","Explosive cyclogenesis,Atmospheric river,Wind and precipitation extremes,Windstorm,Natural hazards,Iberia,"

There are many types of weather extremes that are accompanied by a continuously increasing research literature that contemplates interconnections between human and natural influences, especially with regard to climate change (Robinson, 2021). The events we describe in this chapter are not a complete list. We provide definitions of extreme weather events (Section 1.1) that pose significant societal and economic impacts and are represented by case studies in the chapters that follow. Most of the event types and techniques described here are analyzed further and more extensively in Chapter 2. An overview of current weather forecasting practices is presented in Section 1.2. Furthermore, in this chapter, we provide comprehensive reviews for extreme weather forecasting in urban areas (Section 1.3) and prediction of wildfires (Section 1.4). Urban areas represent scales and complex environments that affect a large part of the population. Wildfires, despite being primarily of natural origin, have a complex relationship with extreme weather conditions and increasingly devastating effects on the built environment and the society. Thus, we need to be able to better understand and predict them accurately in space and time.","weather forecasting,definition,Extreme weather,"

To perform a data acquisition, we recruited volunteers to contribute their fingerprint samples to the dataset in multiple sessions. Once the dataset is filled with both fingerprints under normal and wrinkled conditions, we use a minutiae-based fingerprint verification system to retrieve the match scores between all combinations of prints. Finally, we use receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve to measure the behavior of such systems under maritime environment. Using the equal error rate (EER), we successfully quantify the degradation in performance due to water-induced skin pruning, which is approximately 1% reduction in EER.","Error analysis,Fingers,Degradation,fingerprint recognition,maritime environment,receiver operating characteristic curve,Recruitment,Information retrieval,multispectral fingerprint scanner,equal error rate,fingerprint identification,Data acquisition,Fingerprint recognition,minutiae-based fingerprint verification system,System performance,Skin,RAKE receivers,"
"robust detection of infrared maritime targets for autonomous navigation","2020","This paper addresses a problem on infrared maritime target detection robustly in various situations. Its main contribution is to improve the infrared maritime target detection accuracy in different backgrounds, for various targets, using multiple infrared wave bands. The accuracy and the computational time of traditional infrared maritime searching systems are improved by our proposed Local Peak Singularity Measurement (LPSM)-Based Image Enhancement and Grayscale Distribution Curve Shift Binarization (GDCSB)-Based Target Segmentation. The first part uses LPSM to quantize the local singularity of each peak. Additionally, an enhancement map (EM) is generated based on the quantitative local singularity. After multiplying the original image by the EM, targets can be enhanced and the background will be suppressed. The second part of GDCSB-Based Target Segmentation calculates the desired threshold by cyclic shift of the grayscale distribution curve (GDC) of the enhanced image. After binarizing the enhanced image, real targets can be segmented from the image background. To verify the proposed algorithm, experiments based on 13,625 infrared maritime images and five comparison algorithms were conducted. Results show that the proposed algorithm has solid performance in strong and weak background clutters, different wave bands, different maritime targets, etc.","image denoising,LPSM,enhancement map,target detection,image background,Feature extraction,multiple infrared wave bands,image enhancement,traditional infrared maritime searching systems,image colour analysis,infrared maritime targets,grayscale distribution curve shift binarization-based target segmentation,marine engineering,quantitative local singularity,robust detection,maritime surveillance,Target tracking,object detection,infrared maritime target detection accuracy,maritime targets,Infrared imaging,maritime images,Image segmentation,correlation methods,clutter,infrared imaging,GDCSB-based target segmentation,Object detection,Surveillance,wave bands,image segmentation,autonomous navigation,local peak singularity measurement-based image enhancement,"
"are shipwrecks a real hazard for the ecosystem in the mediterranean sea?","2017","The aim of the present study was to evaluate the hazard from shipwrecks on communities by a holistic approach taking into account different effects on biological communities. Multibeam and Remotely Operated Vehicles surveys recorded ecological assessment of fish and benthic species on three shipwrecks flooded during the Second World War on Maërl beds habitats in the strait of Sicily. Pollution levels of a wide range of chemicals of ecotoxicological concern were also measured in sediments and in fish species from different trophic levels. Statistical analysis evidenced significant differences among pollutant levels between both sediments and fish collected in shipwreck sites and controls. Concerning fish, significant effects due to the vessel's cargo type and flooding position are recorded. In spite of that, our results underline that shipwrecks are also a hotspots of biodiversity and a habitat for preservation strategies in marine ecosystems that need to be monitored.","trace elements,PAHs,Pollution,POPs,Lampedusa Island,beds habitats,"
"integrating observational targets and instrumental data on rock coasts through snorkel surveys: a methodological approach","2020","This work deals with recent advances in scientific snorkel surveying, starting from the results of several case studies in the Mediterranean between 2012 and 2018, for a total survey length of 531.4 km, with the aim of illustrating the pros and cons. The snorkel survey method, described here, also called ‘Geoswim’, allows rough-and-ready surveys of long sectors of rocky coasts. In particular, it is able to collect time-lapse images perpendicularly to the coastline and observe long sectors of rocky coastline, with particular reference to the tidal zone. In addition to the photographic survey along the coast, rough measures, lateral variations in geomorphological, geological, biological, and ecological parameters and the collection of hydrological data are usually performed during the work. The expeditions also provide the opportunity to produce large databases of coastal landforms such as coastal sea caves and tidal notches. The data collected can be improved by additional on-the-spot observations. The evaluation of the methodology here proposed was based on the results of SWOT analysis starting from the results and the experience of previous expeditions. Geoswim is the first snorkel approach that allows the collection of large amount of multidisciplinary data along wide sectors of rocky coastline. At the moment, this approach is the best and probably the only technique for characterizing the tidal and nearshore zone, but also to collect observational data of prominent objects along rocky coasts. However, snorkel observations are affected by limitations similar to those of terrestrial field surveys. The ability to observe specific forms or phenomena increases through the practice of field observation and are strongly observer-influenced. Sheltered sea basins are better suited than ocean basins, where tides and wave energy are generally higher. Data collection is also affected by weather and sea conditions. The quality of time-lapse images and videos may be reduced as a result of breakers at the cliffs, producing images that cannot be used for subsequent analysis. As for external factors, some sectors of the coast may be closed due to local restrictions on field activities.","Mediterranean Sea,Sea caves,Geoswim,Coastal geomorphology,Tidal notches,Swim and snorkel surveys,"
"a new approach to forecast solar irradiances using wrf and libradtran models, validated with merra-2 reanalysis data and pyranometer measures","2021","Solar energy is playing an increasingly important role in the production of electricity through photovoltaic and Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) systems. This type of energy requires an efficient storage system that will allow its use when the sunset or during cloudy weather. Hence, 0-48 hours forecast lead time is crucial for electrical network managers to anticipate energy deficits during periods of cloud occurrence. This study presents a new approach to forecast solar irradiances using a Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) model outputs, coupled with a Radiative Transfer operator, namely libRadtran. The NWP model used in this study is the WRF-Solar configuration of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF), designed for solar energy in order to forecast solar irradiances. The other parameters forecasted by WRF like the vertical profiles of cloud liquid water (CLW), cloud ice water (IWC), clouds fraction, relative humidity, and temperature will be used as input for libRadtran to compute off-line the solar irradiances. Both forecasted irradiances were first compared with the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications Version-2 (MERRA-2) data, then validated a second time by ground measurements for three locations in Algeria for the years 2016 and 2017. The results clearly show that the solar irradiances forecasted directly by WRF-Solar underestimate the MERRA-2 data for high solar zenith angles. With regard to the proposed approach, there is an improvement in the forecast of the solar irradiances during clear sky days and the rRMSE of the calculated Global Tilted Irradiance (GTI) reaches 12% in winter and increases to 22% in summer.","libRadtran,Forecasting,MERRA-2,Global irradiance,WRF,"

"quantitative analysis on risk influencing factors for major maritime accidents from a worldwide perspective","2023","Maritime transport plays an increasingly important role in global shipping. In the meantime, with the development of the shipping industry, the frequency of maritime traffic accidents is also increasing. More importantly, the increasing number of maritime traffic accidents with serious consequences in the past 20 years cannot be ignored. Analysis of major accidents can help identify trends and prevent future accidents. The data set of maritime traffic accidents from 2002 to 2022 is analyzed in this study, focusing on the ship size, ship age, ship type, and other factors of ships involved in major accidents.

This method compares the accident risks of different sizes and types of ships in pairs, calculates and analyzes the impact of each risk factor on the occurrence of serious accidents. The results indicate that the risk of major accidents on small and medium-sized ships is higher than that on large ships.

"spatiotemporal variability of the precipitation concentration and diversity in central asia","2020","More extreme precipitation is expected to occur in the arid and wet regions due to climate warming. This intensification will increase the risk of floods, soil erosion, and droughts in the world's dry regions. Exploring the precipitation's irregularity and the daily precipitation concentration in Central Asia (CA) has significant implications for regional agricultural development and ecosystem services. However, the irregularity of precipitation was poorly understood throughout the entire CA due to the sparse meteorological observations. Using the daily Multi-Source Weighted-Ensemble Precipitation (MSWEP-V2.2) from 1979 to 2016 across CA, this study investigated the spatiotemporal variations of the daily precipitation concentration index (CI) and the precipitation diversity and analyzed their attributes and implications. The results demonstrated that the CI was significantly negatively correlated with the precipitation frequency and amount. The distribution of the precipitation frequency diversity (Hfre) and the precipitation amount diversity (Hamount) showed an opposite pattern with the CI, implying that the low Hfre and Hamount values were corresponding to a high precipitation concentration. The high CI values were found in the Tarim Basin and near the Aral Sea, revealing a strong irregularity in precipitation. The decrease regarding the light precipitation frequency or increase in the torrential precipitation frequency generated the increasing precipitation frequency diversity, corresponding to a widespread significant reduction of the CI in CA. The decreased CI and increased precipitation diversity over past decades were likely related to the warming phase of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation. The shift from light to extreme precipitation will trigger the risk of flooding and soil erosion and bring about big challenges for water resources management in the arid and semi-arid regions.","MSWEP,Daily precipitation concentration,Precipitation diversity,Central Asia,Climate change,"
"lda-mig detectors for maritime targets in nonhomogeneous sea clutter","2023","This article deals with the problem of detecting maritime targets embedded in nonhomogeneous sea clutter, where the limited number of secondary data is available due to the heterogeneity of sea clutter. A class of linear discriminant analysis (LDA)-based matrix information geometry (MIG) detectors is proposed in the supervised scenario. As customary, Hermitian positive-definite (HPD) matrices are used to model the observational sample data, and the clutter covariance matrix of the received dataset is estimated as the geometric mean of the secondary HPD matrices. Given a set of training HPD matrices with class labels, which are elements of a higher dimensional HPD matrix manifold, the LDA manifold projection learns a mapping from the higher dimensional HPD matrix manifold to a lower dimensional one subject to maximum discrimination. In this study, the LDA manifold projection, with the cost function maximizing between-class distance while minimizing within-class distance, is formulated as an optimization problem in the Stiefel manifold. Four robust LDA-MIG detectors corresponding to different geometric measures are proposed. Numerical results based on both simulated radar clutter with interferences and real IPIX radar data show the advantage of the proposed LDA-MIG detectors against their counterparts without using LDA and the state-of-the-art maritime target detection methods in nonhomogeneous sea clutter.","linear discriminant analysis,covariance matrices,geometry,marine radar,secondary HPD matrices,Hermitian positive-definite (HPD) manifold,matrix information geometry (MIG) detectors,radar detection,target detection,radar clutter,Sea measurements,Covariance matrices,simulated radar clutter,Manifolds,Data models,object detection,optimisation,LDA manifold projection,maritime targets,within-class distance,between-class distance,Hermitian positive-definite matrices,matrix information geometry detectors,robust LDA-MIG detectors,clutter,class labels,nonhomogeneous sea clutter,linear discriminant analysis (LDA),Training,higher dimensional HPD matrix manifold,Clutter,observational sample data,clutter covariance matrix,geophysical signal processing,training HPD matrices,learning (artificial intelligence),remote sensing by radar,Detectors,secondary data,oceanographic techniques,"
"automatic gain control for asm channel in maritime communication","2015","This paper presents Automatic Gain Control (AGC) algorithm in maritime communication system using application specific message (ASM). In maritime communication, gain control is not easy than land mobile communication. Received signal is converted to digital signal by analog to digital converter (ADC). If the signal input power of ADC is smaller than adequate power then quantization noise increases. On the contrary, if the signal input power of ADC is large than adequate power then the output signal of ADC is saturated. This paper proposes essential algorithm that controls gain value effectively in case that received signal power and propagation delay are unknown. We first analyze the general method of AGC in maritime communication. The analysis will show that the time for gain convergence is needed and much longer than known case because the distance from transmitting ship to receiving ship is randomly distributed and unknown in each slot. The difference of gain values in each slot is as large as 100dB in maximum case. The larger a difference of gain values is, the longer gain convergence time is. This is because that any ship can transmit in any slot randomly, therefore, received signal power is not expectable. We show how proposed algorithm can effectively control the gain value in maritime communication environments. Result of simulation shows that the utilization of proposed algorithm can calculate the optimal gain value and regenerate optimal signal that is similar with original source. As a result, proposed AGC algorithm changes all gain values of total received signal into same gain value using back gain compensation. Especially, the gain value of received signal should be controlled in adequate because transmission randomly occurs in each slot in maritime communication. Proposed automatic gain control algorithm is essential and effective for stable demodulation performance in ASM maritime communication.","ASM channel,auto gain control,analog to digital converter,Gain control,Marine vehicles,Delays,Propagation delay,automatic gain control algorithm,Hardware,AIS,gain compensation,analogue-digital conversion,maritime communication,application specific message,ADC,AGC algorithm,automatic gain control,marine communication,Algorithm design and analysis,re-scaling,ASM,Demodulation,"

"a lagrangian analysis of the moisture budget over the fertile crescent during two intense drought episodes","2018","The Fertile Crescent (FC) region comprises the east coast of the Mediterranean Sea and the northern part of the Arabian Peninsula. The FC suffered two severe drought episodes separated by a 7-year period, in 1998–2000 and 2007–2009, which are considered the most severe episodes to hit the region in the last 50 years. A Lagrangian model (FLEXPART) and ERA-Interim data (with a 1° × 1° lat-long resolution) were used to identify for the first time the climatological sources of moisture for the FC and their characteristics. Variability and the source-receptor relationships, concerning their contribution to the precipitation, and the implications regarding the transport of moisture changes over the FC, during the wet season (October-May) from 1980 to 2014 were analysed. The main climatological moisture sources during this period were determined to be the FC itself, the eastern Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea, the Persian Gulf, the Arabian Sea, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the central and western parts of the Mediterranean Sea. The analysis showed higher anomalous conditions in the moisture transport from some moisture sources during the two outstanding drought episodes. The key feature of the wet seasons during these episodes was a deficit in the moisture losses over the studied area related to the FC itself, the Red and Arabian Seas sources, followed and to a lesser extent by the eastern Mediterranean Sea over the northern part of the FC region. Nevertheless, the moisture supply deficit from the sources was much greater during the 2007–2009 drought event. The SPEI index at large scales (24 months) showed that the 2007–2009 episode was part of longer-term drought conditions that had been developing over the previous months, reinforcing the drought severity given recycling processes attributed to the FC. During the two extreme drought episodes, the mountainous terrain over the northern and eastern FC suffered the highest precipitation deficits, and these areas are, precisely, the most influenced by two of the major moisture sources, namely, the FC and eastern Mediterranean Sea. The decreased moisture contribution from these main sources led to more intense droughts over the region. As a result, both regions should be considered as hotspots to signal severe or extreme droughts in the region.","Moisture budget,Lagrangian analysis,SPEI,Drought episodes,Fertile Crescent,"
"sources of the seasonal-trend behaviour and periodicity modulation of 7be air concentration in the atmospheric surface layer observed in southeastern spain","2019","The components and the periodicity characterising airborne 7Be monthly concentration collected in Granada (SE Spain) between 2000 and 2018 are studied. These 19 years of measurements are particularly significant for the 7Be analysis as they cover the complete 24th solar cycle, 2008–2018. A Time Series Decomposition (TSD) technique has been applied to determine the different components present in the dataset: the trend, seasonal and irregular components. Then, the atmospheric parameters (Precipitation (Pp), Relative Humidity (RH), Temperature (Temp), Wind speed (WS), Total Cloudiness (TC), Low Cloudiness (LC)), teleconnection indices and the solar activity (Sun Spot Number, SSN) were used to justify the variability of each component. SSN and the teleconnection indices (Western Mediterranean Oscillation (WeMO), Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) and Quasi Biennial Oscillation (QBO)) are found to have a major impact on the trend component of 7Be. In turn, all the atmospheric parameters were found to have strong impact on the seasonal component. In order to observe the change in the impact of the parameters from the 24th solar cycle (from 2008 to 2018) to the complete time series (starting in 2000), the comparison between the two periods has been carried out. The results show that, over the 24th solar cycle, the SSN impacted predominantly on the trend component, whereas atmospheric parameters showed a slightly higher impact on the seasonal component. In addition, some atmospheric factors (Temp, RH, Pp, TC, LC) appeared to partially affect the irregular component. The analysis of the two phases of the 24th solar cycle shows that the influence of SSN is higher during the descending phase than during the ascending one. This behaviour is opposed to the one found for the 23rd solar cycle, which clarifies the special characteristics of the 24th cycle. Besides that, the Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) analysis was applied in order to extract the possible periodicities characterising 7Be data. The analysis revealed three sets of periodicities. Then, the Wavelet Coherence Analysis (WCA) method was particularly useful to study coherences between 7Be data and teleconnection indices. The 7Be concentrations in the large period (11–14 years) detected by CWT was found to be mainly modulated by WeMO, AMO and QBO, while the NAO modulates the smaller periods.","Wavelet analysis,Teleconnections indices,Time series decomposition,Atmospheric aerosols,Be,"
"maritime traffic probabilistic forecasting based on vesselsâ€™ waterway patterns and motion behaviors","2017","Maritime traffic prediction is critical for ocean transportation safety management. In this paper, we propose a novel knowledge assisted methodology for maritime traffic forecasting based on a vessel's waterway pattern and motion behavior. The vessel's waterway pattern is extracted through a proposed lattice-based DBSCAN algorithm that significantly reduces the problem scale, and its motion behavior is quantitatively modeled for the first time using kernel density estimation. The proposed methodology facilitates the knowledge extraction, storage, and retrieval, allowing for seamless knowledge transfer to support maritime traffic forecasting. By incorporating both the vessel's waterway pattern and motion behavior knowledge, our solution suggests a set of probable coordinates with the corresponding probability as the forecasting output. The proposed forecasting algorithm is capable of accurately predicting maritime traffic 5, 30, and 60 min ahead, while its computation can be efficiently completed in milliseconds for single vessel prediction. Owing to such a high computational efficiency, an extensive predictive analysis of hundreds of vessels has been reported for the first time in this paper. A web-based prototype platform is implemented for Singapore waters to demonstrate the solution's feasibility in a real-world maritime operation system. The proposed approaches can be generalized for other marine waters around the world.","vessel waterway patterns,data mining,Transportation,maritime traffic,maritime operation system,Prediction algorithms,marine transportation,single vessel prediction,transportation,knowledge transfer,Planning,forecasting theory,Stability analysis,ocean transportation safety management,lattice-based DBSCAN algorithm,vessel motion behaviors,knowledge engineering,forecasting algorithm,kernel density estimation,marine engineering,pattern clustering,Artificial intelligence,Forecasting,maritime traffic probabilistic forecasting,motion behavior knowledge,knowledge extraction,probability,knowledge acquisition,traffic engineering computing,maritime traffic prediction,Data mining,knowledge discovery,knowledge assisted methodology,"

"impacts of summer and winter conditions on summer river low flows in low elevation, snow-affected catchments","2022","Reduced snow storage has been associated with lower river low flows in mountainous catchments, exacerbating summer hydrological droughts. However, the impacts of changing snow storage on summer low flows in low-elevation, snow-affected catchments has not yet been investigated. To address this knowledge gap, the dominant hydroclimate predictors of summer low flows were first identified through correlation analysis in 12 tributary catchments of the St. Lawrence River in the Canadian province of Quebec. The correlation results show that summer low flow is most sensitive to summer rainfall, while maximum snow water equivalent (SWE) is the dominant winter preconditioning factor of low flows, particularly at the end of summer. The multivariate sensitivity of summer low flow to hydroclimate predictors was then quantified by multilevel regression analysis, considering also the effect of catchment biophysical attributes. Accumulated rainfall since snow cover disappearance was found to be the prime control on summer low flow, as expected for the humid climate of Quebec. Maximum SWE had a secondary but significant positive influence on low flow, sometimes on the same order as the negative effect of evapotranspiration losses. As a whole, our results show that in these low elevation catchments, thicker winter snowpacks that last longer and melt slower in the spring are conducive to higher low flows in the following summer. More rugged and forested catchments with coarser soils were found to have higher summer low flows than flatter agricultural catchments with compacted clayed soils. This emphasizes the role of soils and geology on infiltration, aquifer recharge and related river baseflow in summer. Further climate warming and snowpack depletion could reduce future summer low flow, exacerbating hydrological droughts and impacting ecosystems integrity and ecological services.","Snow melt,Snow water equivalent,Interannual variability,River low flow,Climate change,"
"uncrewed maritime systems for coral reef conservation","2020","This paper provides an overview of demonstrated and emerging work applying Uncrewed Maritime Systems (UMS) to coral reef conservation. It blends theoretical analysis and current field results with a focus on recent developments in Australia. Here a combination of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) and Uncrewed Surface Vehicles (USVs) are being used to support restoration of coral communities on the Great Barrier Reef. In 2018 and 2019, UMS were evaluated to assist in the â€œplantingâ€ of coral larvae during the reef's annual sexual reproduction periods. Scientific results on actual coral larval settlement and recruitment, and hence coral community restoration using these techniques is showing promise but are beyond the scope of this paper. This paper focuses on the technical challenges and opportunities around employing AUVs and USVs for reef restoration at scale. These include: reduction in platform cost, management of larvae supply, precision of larvae placement and user interface/autonomy. This paper examines the field use of the existing prototype robots from recent on-reef trials and hypothesizes solutions to increase efficiency of larval distribution.","Recruitment,Productivity,Great Barrier Reef,AD 2018 to 2019,recruitment,user interfaces,actual coral larval settlement,Optical sensors,Uncrewed Maritime Systems,coral reef conservation,Robot sensing systems,Uncrewed Surface Vehicles,coral communities,Autonomous Underwater Vehicles,autonomous underwater vehicles,user interface/autonomy,prototype robots,Prototypes,coral larvae,Scalability,reef restoration,hypothesizes solutions,Australia,mobile robots,USVs,AUVs,Tools,coral community restoration,on-reef trials,UMS,reef annual sexual reproduction periods,current field results,oceanographic techniques,"
"hot moments and hotspots of cyanobacteria hyperblooms in the curonian lagoon (se baltic sea) revealed via remote sensing-based retrospective analysis","2021","A temporally and spatially detailed historical (1985–2018) analysis of cyanobacteria blooms was performed in the Curonian Lagoon (Lithuania, Russia), the largest coastal lagoon in the Baltic Sea. Satellite data allowed the mapping of cyanobacteria surface accumulations, so-called “scums”, and of chlorophyll-a concentration. The 34-year time series shows a tendency towards later occurrence (October–November) of the cyanobacteria scum presence, whereas the period of its onset (June–July) remains relatively constant. The periods when scums are present, “hot moments”, have been consistently increasing in duration since 2008. The differences in the starting, ending and annual duration of cyanobacteria blooms have been significantly altered by hydro-meteorological conditions (river discharge, water temperature, and wind conditions) and their year-round patterns. The most important environmental factors that determined the temporal changes of the scum presence and area were the standing stock of cyanobacteria and the ambient wind conditions. The “hotspots”, the areas where the blooms most likely occur, were distributed in the south-southwestern and central parts of the lagoon. The least affected areas were the northern part, which is connected to the coastal waters of the Baltic Sea, and the Nemunas River delta region. The longstanding, well-established spatial patterns of cyanobacteria blooms were linked to hydrodynamic features, namely water renewal time and current patterns, and to potential nutrient sources that included muddy sediments and the locations of colonies of piscivorous birds. Our findings confirmed that the annual and seasonal variations of cyanobacteria blooms and their regulation are a complex issue due to interactions between multiple factors over spatially and temporally broad scales. Despite great progress in the prevention and control of eutrophication and cyanobacteria blooms, the lagoon is still considered to be in a poor ecological status. This work provides a new and missing understanding on the spatial and temporal extent of cyanobacteria blooms and the factors that govern them. Such an understanding can help in planning management strategies, forecasting the magnitude and severity of blooms under changing nutrient loads and potential climate scenarios.","Curonian Lagoon,Remote sensing,Eutrophication,Cyanobacteria scum,Drivers of hyperblooms,"
"mining usage scenarios in business processes: outlier-aware discovery and run-time prediction","2011","A prominent goal of process mining is to build automatically a model explaining all the episodes recorded in the log of some transactional system. Whenever the process to be mined is complex and highly-flexible, however, equipping all the traces with just one model might lead to mixing different usage scenarios, thereby resulting in a spaghetti-like process description. This is, in fact, often circumvented by preliminarily applying clustering methods on the process log in order to identify all its hidden variants. In this paper, two relevant problems that arise in the context of applying such methods are addressed, which have received little attention so far: (i) making the clustering aware of outlier traces, and (ii) finding predictive models for clustering results. The first issue impacts on the effectiveness of clustering algorithms, which can indeed be led to confuse real process variants with exceptional behavior or malfunctions. The second issue instead concerns the opportunity of predicting the behavioral class of future process instances, by taking advantage of context-dependent “non-structural” data (e.g., activity executors, parameter values). The paper formalizes and analyzes these two issues and illustrates various mining algorithms to face them. All the algorithms have been implemented and integrated into a system prototype, which has been thoroughly validated over two real-life application scenarios.","Process mining,Decision trees,Clustering,Business processes,"
"triton: high-speed maritime wireless mesh network","2013","This article presents the TRI-media Telematic Oceanographic Network (TRITON) project, which aims to develop a high-speed and low-cost maritime communication system. The article includes information pertaining to background studies, high-level architecture, network feasibility, maritime communication environment, technology developments, prototype implementations and link performance measurements. The motivation for this project stems from the fact that there is an increasing need for low-cost and high-speed maritime communication, with demands mainly coming from regulatory and crew welfare needs. The system described in this article is a wireless mesh network based on the IEEE 802.16. An analysis of the node connectivity based on real ship traffic data shows that the network is feasible in shipping lanes with a high density of ships. The system also considers the use of an intelligent middleware to allow communications to switch back to a satellite link in cases where neighboring ships are sparse or at locations far away from mesh base stations. Protocol enhancements to both the Medium Access Control (MAC) and networking layers and a hardware design that features multiple transceivers and the implementation of antenna switching to counter sea wave reflection and rocking problems are presented. Measurements of field trials show that the proposed wireless mesh network could be an effective solution for maritime communications.","medium access control,high-speed maritime wireless mesh network,antenna switching implementation,wireless mesh networks,intelligent middleware,radio transceivers,Marine vehicles,node connectivity,protocol enhancement,Mesh networks,Sea measurements,real ship traffic data,Wireless networks,MAC,antennas,TRI-media Telematic Oceanographic Network project,access protocols,ships,rocking problem,low-cost maritime communication system,Maritime communication,Sea surface,networking layer,multiple transceiver,mesh base station,satellite link,telecommunication traffic,TRITON,satellite links,sea wave reflection,marine communication,IEEE 802.16 standard,IEEE 802.16 Standards,WiMax,middleware,"
"life history of an anticyclonic eddy in the algerian basin from altimetry data, tracking algorithm and in situ observations.","2020","Frequently-forming long-life mesoscale eddies are observed in the Algerian Basin that influence the circulation of the wider Western Mediterranean Sea. Most of these structures store and transport water masses including associated physical and biological properties throughout the entire basin. In order to study the evolution of a long-life anticyclonic eddy, we use a multiplatform approach based on remote sensing data analysis and in situ measurements. We present a case study of an anticyclonic eddy that persisted for 17 months within the basin. The feature was identified through a hybrid method of eddy detection and tracking applied to altimetry data, and sampled twice during two different oceanographic cruises in autumn 2004 and late spring 2005. Transect observations of potential temperature, salinity, density and the dissolved oxygen concentration were utilised to infer water mass properties and eddy characteristics. In situ data show that water of Atlantic origin, initially trapped by the eddy during its formation, was modified during the eddy lifetime. The time evolution of radius, kinetic energy and vorticity suggests dividing the eddy lifetime into three phases: the eddy formation, an intermediate period of high variability and a final, lower energy phase. The track followed by the eddy confirms the hypothesis of an interaction with the North Balearic Front and a consequent change of the eddy's physical properties. Decomposing the eddy's kinetic energy into mean and fluctuating terms allows us to describe its interaction with the mean circulation of the basin. In particular during formation, the southern part of the eddy absorbs energy from the mean circulation, while it provides energy to the mean flow in its northern part. In the second phase, when the eddy is far from the coast, it receives energy from the mean flow. Combining in situ data analysis with the results of the satellite-imagery-based detection and tracking method has proven to be a very useful method in assessing the evolution of a mesoscale structure in the Algerian Basin and its interaction with the large scale ocean dynamics of the Western Mediterranean Sea.",""

"what do we know about past changes in the water cycle of central asian headwaters? a review","2013","We have reviewed about 100 studies on past changes in climate, snow cover, glaciers and runoff in Central Asian headwater catchments, which have been published in the past 20years. We included studies published by Central Asian researchers in Russian language, which are usually not easily accessible to international researchers. Most studies agreed on general warming trends in Central Asia with acceleration since the 1970s, but varied with regard to seasonal changes and the magnitude of the warming. Most studies also confirmed that glaciers in the Tien Shan and the Pamir continue to retreat and to shrink, though only little is known about mass and volume changes. Only few studies investigated changes in seasonal snow cover, and they suggested a decrease in maximum snow depth and a reduction in snow cover duration. The studies on runoff trends in the high mountain areas of Central Asia indicated a complex response of catchments to changes in climate. It appears that catchments with a higher fraction of glacierized area showed mainly increasing runoff trends in the past, while river basins with less or no glacierization exhibited large variations in the observed runoff changes. We conclude that our knowledge is still incomplete in particular with regard to the magnitude and the spatio-temporal patterns of changes in the water cycle of Central Asian headwater catchments. The limitations in our knowledge are due to (1) the scarcity of reliable and appropriate data sets especially for the glacio-nival zone; (2) methodological limitations of trend analysis; (3) the heterogeneity in both spatial and temporal extent of the available analyses, hampering the synthesis to a regional picture; and (4) the insufficiently understood interactions between changes in highly-variable climate parameters, the cryosphere, and the hydrological response of individual headwater catchments. Finally, there is a need for sound attribution studies linking the observed hydrological changes in individual catchments to particular processes triggered by climatic and cryospheric changes. This research gap needs urgently to be closed as projections of future hydrological changes are of vital importance for water management in Central Asia.","Tien Shan,glaciers,river runoff,hydrological change,climate change,Pamir,seasonal snow cover,"
"the geochemistry of gem opals as evidence of their origin","2008","Seventy-seven gem opals from ten countries were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) through a dilution process, in order to establish the nature of the impurities. The results are correlated to the mode of formation and physical properties and are instrumental in establishing the geographical origin of a gem opal. The geochemistry of an opal is shown to be dependant mostly on the host rock, at least for examples from Mexico and Brazil, even if modified by weathering processes. In order of decreasing concentration, the main impurities present are Al, Ca, Fe, K, Na, and Mg (more than 500 ppm). Other noticeable elements in lesser amounts are Ba, followed by Zr, Sr, Rb, U, and Pb. For the first time, geochemistry helps to discriminate some varieties of opals. The Ba content, as well as the chondrite-normalized REE pattern, are the keys to separating sedimentary opals (Ba>110 ppm, Eu and Ce anomalies) from volcanic opals (Ba<110 ppm, no Eu or Ce anomaly). The Ca content, and to a lesser extent that of Mg, Al, K and Nb, helps to distinguish gem opals from different volcanic environments. The limited range of concentrations for all elements in precious (play-of-color) compared to common opals, indicates that this variety must have very specific, or more restricted, conditions of formation. We tentatively interpreted the presence of impurities in terms of crystallochemistry, even if opal is a poorly crystallized or amorphous material. The main replacement is the substitution of Si4+ by Al3+ and Fe3+. The induced charge imbalance is compensated chiefly by Ca2+, Mg2+, Mn2+, Ba2+, K+, and Na+. In terms of origin of color, greater concentrations of iron induce darker colors (from yellow to “chocolate brown”). This element inhibits luminescence for concentrations above 1000 ppm, whereas already a low content in U (≤1 ppm) induces a green luminescence.","Opal,Trace element analysis,Chemical composition,Genesis,ICP-MS,"
"a lightweight authentication scheme for 6g-iot enabled maritime transport system","2023","The Sixth-Generation (6G) mobile network has the potential to provide not only traditional communication services but also additional processing, caching, sensing, and control capabilities to a massive number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Meanwhile, a 6G mobile network may provide global coverage and diverse quality-of-service provisioning to the Maritime Transportation System (MTS) when enabled through satellite systems. Although modern MTS has gained significant benefits from Internet of Things (IoT) and 6G technologies, threats and challenges in terms of security and privacy have also been grown substantially. Tracking the location of vessels, GPS spoofing, unauthorized access to data, and message tampering are some of the potential security and privacy vulnerabilities in the 6G-IoT enabled MTS. In this article, we propose a lightweight authentication protocol for a 6G-IoT enabled maritime transportation system to efficiently assist and ensure the security and privacy of maritime transportation systems.

"building defect detection: external versus internal thermography","2016","Many buildings suffer from defects in the building envelope, such as missing insulation, thermal bridging, cracks and moisture problems. Thermography is one technology that can help to identify such defects. However, there are different approaches towards assessing the building envelope. Pass-by thermography is an emerging method, which is used to capture single thermal images of external building elevations. Compared with traditional walk-through thermography, it is much quicker and cheaper to perform. Yet it is currently unclear how successful this methodology is at detecting building defects. This paper qualitatively compares pass-by thermography and walk-through thermography. A set of 122 residential dwellings in South West England was inspected using the both methodologies. Results show that substantially more defects were detected using walk-through thermography, with internal inspections yielding the greatest number of detected defects. Significant constraints with walk-past thermography were identified, such as unknown occupancy behaviour, transient climatic conditions, fixed viewing angles and spatial resolution limitations, which were all found to have a greater impact on image results than during walk-through thermography. Although trends in conductivity defects were found from target comparison analysis between similar dwellings, viewing single external elevations under walk-past thermography was found to miss many different defect types, which would have normally been discovered during traditional walk-through thermography.","Defect detection,Walk-past,Thermography,Walk-through,"
"influence of the atlantic ocean on the magnitude of air temperature trends under current warming","2010","An analysis is made of the magnitudes of the linear trends of daily mean temperature in the city of Minsk for the period from 1966 to 2008. It is found that the largest magnitudes of trends in the annual variation correspond to mid-January as well as to the end of July–August, whereas in May and in November they are poorly pronounced (positive or even negative). The maximum magnitudes of the air temperature trends are in good agreement with maximum warm advection by currents of the Gulf Stream system, while modest warm advection by currents corresponds to weak positive and even negative magnitudes of the temperature trends. Consequently, the magnitude of the temperature trends in the annual variation is modulated by warm advection by currents of the Gulf Stream system which contains a half-yearly component and is determined by natural factors. Therefore, the driving forces of current climate warming cannot be attributed solely to the increase of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.","Gulf Stream,Climate,temperature,Atlantic Ocean,trends,"

"verification and intercomparison of global ocean eulerian near-surface currents","2023","The OceanPredict task team for Intercomparison and Validation (IV-TT) has established the CLASS4 data standard for routine forecast verification against selected reference observing platforms. The set of CLASS4 reference data has been recently extended to include near-surface currents derived from the trajectories of drifting buoys drogued at 15 m. We have applied these data to the Ocean Model, Analysis and Prediction System (OceanMAPS) at the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (ABoM) for verification and inter-comparison with Mercator Océan International ocean forecast system (MOi), the operational models of the Met Office, UK: Forecast Ocean Assimilation Model (FOAM) and Coupled Atmosphere-Land-Ocean-Ice Data Assimilation (CPLDA) systems, and the Global Ice Ocean Prediction System (GDPS-GIOPS) at the Canadian Centre for Meteorological and Environmental Prediction (CCMEP). The aims for this verification analysis are to extend the routine monitoring of the operational system; to assess the OceanMAPS skill against other models; and to inform our stakeholders of the OceanMAPS performance. We have evaluated the impacts of adding Stokes drift and tidal currents from separate global wave and global tide models to the model currents on the verification of currents. Including Stokes drift leads to significant improvements in representation and the metrics for model skill while inclusion of tides has no significant impact on the global statistics. Zonal currents have a stronger signal than the meridional currents as indicated by their high correlation with observations, and lower errors. This indicates zonal currents on average are more predictable and persistent than the meridional currents, resulting in improved representation in the models. Overall, MOi, and the new version of OceanMAPS (4.0i), and FOAM show marginally better performance against the observations relative to other models. Although there are significant differences in the configurations of the eight models under evaluation, all the models are shown to be remarkably statistically equivalent with consistent spatial and temporal patterns indicating the main differences are attributable to unrepresented processes. We therefore conclude that there is significant scope to further improve the representation of the modelled currents with the observations.","Intercomparison of global ocean models,Global drifter program,Ocean modelling,Ocean currents verification,"
"glacial activity reflected in a continuous lacustrine record since the early holocene from the proglacial laigu lake on the southeastern tibetan plateau","2016","The southeastern Tibetan Plateau is an important area of monsoonal maritime glaciation, and it serves as a watershed for several major Asian rivers, including the Brahmaputra River and the Lantsang River. Glacial activity is sensitive to climate change in this area. However, due to high annual ablation and accumulation in this region, ice cores over long time scales are difficult to retrieve. In addition, reconstructed glacial activity from moraine dates is usually discontinuous. Here, we use a sediment core retrieved from Laigu Lake, which is a proglacial lake located in the headwaters of the Parlung Zangbo River, the largest tributary of the Brahmaputra River, to reflect glacial activities over the last ~8000years in this area. Samples of the sediment core were analyzed for magnetic susceptibility, XRF (X-ray florescence) scanned elemental concentration and grain size. The results indicated that the magnetic susceptibility and CPS (peak area counts per second) of strontium (Sr) could be used as proxies for glacial activity. The CPS of Sr and the magnetic susceptibility were lower and the glacial activity was weak before 4.3calka BP. Expansion of the glaciers in this area began from 4.3calka BP and continued to develop after ~3.3calka BP. From 2.2calka BP to 1.6calka BP, the glaciers retreated substantially, followed by another development period until the onset of modern global warming. Based on our findings and other climate records, we concluded that glacial activity in the southeastern Tibetan Plateau areas was mainly influenced by Northern Hemisphere temperatures and summer insolation over a sub-orbital time scale, but did not respond to the Indian monsoon.","XRF,The southeastern Tibetan Plateau,Glacial activity,Magnetic susceptibility,Lacustrine sediment,Holocene,"
"chapter 6 - energetic particles’ impact on the near tropopause ozone and water vapour","2020","Recent understanding of energetic particles’ impact on the stratospheric ozone is usually limited to its destruction by the NOx and HOx ozone destructive cycles. This chapter reveals that ion-molecular chemistry, initiated by the lower energetic electrons in the Regener–Pfotzer maximum, is able to initiate autocatalytic O3 production in the lower stratosphere. This additional source of ozone is able to explain many puzzling features of ozone, including its longitudinal and hemispherical asymmetry. Moreover, the chapter shows that the long-term variations of atmospheric specific humidity at 150hPa covariate with the ozone at 70hPa, as well as with the centennial variations of galactic cosmic rays (GCR). The statistical analysis provided implies that this relation is more likely to be due to the interdependence between near tropopause ozone and water vapour, instead of the individual impact of GCRs on both ozone and water vapour.","Impact of galactic cosmic rays and solar protons on atmospheric O,Autocatalytic ozone production in the lower stratosphere,Centennial variations of near tropopause water vapour,"
"air pollution trends measured from terra: co and aod over industrial, fire-prone, and background regions","2021","Following past studies to quantify decadal trends in global carbon monoxide (CO) using satellite observations, we update estimates and find a CO trend in column amounts of about −0.50 % per year between 2002 to 2018, which is a deceleration compared to analyses performed on shorter records that found −1 % per year. Aerosols are co-emitted with CO from both fires and anthropogenic sources but with a shorter lifetime than CO. A combined trend analysis of CO and aerosol optical depth (AOD) measurements from space helps to diagnose the drivers of regional differences in the CO trend. We use the long-term records of CO from the Measurements of Pollution in the Troposphere (MOPITT) and AOD from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument. Other satellite instruments measuring CO in the thermal infrared, AIRS, TES, IASI, and CrIS, show consistent hemispheric CO variability and corroborate results from the trend analysis performed with MOPITT CO. Trends are examined by hemisphere and in regions for 2002 to 2018, with uncertainties quantified. The CO and AOD records are split into two sub-periods (2002 to 2010 and 2010 to 2018) in order to assess trend changes over the 16 years. We focus on four major population centers: Northeast China, North India, Europe, and Eastern USA, as well as fire-prone regions in both hemispheres. In general, CO declines faster in the first half of the record compared to the second half, while AOD trends show more variability across regions. We find evidence of the atmospheric impact of air quality management policies. The large decline in CO found over Northeast China is initially associated with an improvement in combustion efficiency, with subsequent additional air quality improvements from 2010 onwards. Industrial regions with minimal emission control measures such as North India become more globally relevant as the global CO trend weakens. We also examine the CO trends in monthly percentile values to understand seasonal implications and find that local changes in biomass burning are sufficiently strong to counteract the global downward trend in atmospheric CO, particularly in late summer.","AOD,Carbon monoxide,Interannual variability,Trend,NASA/Terra satellite,"
"process-mining-enabled audit of information systems: methodology and an application","2018","Current methodologies for Information Systems (ISs) audits suffer from some limitations that could question the effectiveness of such procedures in detecting deviations, frauds, or abuses. Process Mining (PM), a set of business-process-related diagnostic and improvement techniques, can tackle these weaknesses, but literature lacks contributions that address this possibility concretely. Thus, by framing PM as an Expert System (ES) engine, this paper presents a five-step PM-based methodology for IS audits and validates it through a case in a freight export port process managed by a Port Community System (PCS), an open electronic platform enabling information exchange among port stakeholders. The validation pointed out some advantages (e.g. depth of analysis, easier automation, less invasiveness) of our PM-enabled methodology over extant ESs and tools for IS audit. The substantive test and the check on the PCS processing controls and output controls allowed to identify four major non-conformances likely implying both legal and operational risks, and two unforeseen process deviations that were not known by the port authority, but that could improve the flexibility of the process. These outcomes set the stage for an export process reengineering, and for revising the boundaries in the process flow of the PCS.","Business process management (BPM),Risk management,Information systems audit,Process mining,Port community system (PCS),Error detection,"
"analyzing the situational and event-dependent maritime traffic variations using cosmo-skymed sar imagery in wuhan, china, before and during covid-19 lockdown","2021","Vessel detection and their activities in the sea can provide updates on latest trends in maritime trade. Space-borne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) can aid in detecting vessels in (almost) all weather conditions.

"ship behavior recognition based on infrared video analysis in a maritime environment","2015","In order to improve the monitoring capability of officer on watch for the environment around the own ship, cover the shortage of RADAR and AIS in ship behavior recognition field, this paper proposes a ship behavior recognition algorithm based on video analysis. After analyzing the ship behavior we found that the silhouette's size and shape variation of ship in infrared image were related to its behavior over a period of time, that is to say when the distance between the own ship and the target ship has decreased during this period, its silhouette's size would increase. And when the target ship is heading toward the own ship directly and the distance between them has decreased (the DCPA (Distance to Closest Point of Approach) is very small, and the TCPA (Time to Closest Point of Approach) is decreasing), the silhouette's size of the target ship would enlarge, nevertheless, its silhouette's shape would have no significant changes. According to these characteristics of ship behavior, the height of target ship's silhouette is used to represent silhouette's size and the ratio between the width and the height of the target ship's silhouette is used to represent silhouette's shape in the ship behavior recognition algorithm we proposed. And then the least square method is used to fit the height and the ratio into straight line during this period respectively, whose slope reflects the changing trend and variation of target ship's silhouette. At last, the recognition algorithm was verified by analyzing infrared video in a maritime environment, which shows that the characteristic of ship behavior summarized by this paper is correct and the recognition algorithm based on them is feasible.","Time to Closest Point of Approach,Cameras,Marine vehicles,Character recognition,intelligent recognition,ship behavior,Target recognition,ships,maritime surveillance,Image recognition,DCPA,Shape,least squares approximations,video analysis,Radar,infrared image,target ship,video signal processing,ship behavior recognition algorithm,TCPA,infrared imaging,maritime environment,marine communication,least square method,infrared video,Distance to Closest Point of Approach,object recognition,"
"connectivity and route analysis for a maritime communication network","2007","We are interested in extending the coverage of a terrestrial wireless communication network to the sea so that cost effective communications can be provided to the ships. The coverage extension can be achieved by using ships as relay nodes for other ships that are further away. This paper studies the feasibility of doing so at the Singapore East Coast. The feasibility is based on having 90% of the nodes connected to the terrestrial network 90% of the times. Using actual ship mobility traces in the area, we confirm that such a network is feasible when transmission range between land station and ship is at least 15 km and transmission range between ships is at least 8 km. For a feasible network, there are always multiple candidate routes between a ship and the land station, and the average path length of the candidate routes is about 1.8. This calls for possible use of multi-path routing protocols, and the short path length implies a potentially acceptable end-to-end delay for real-time traffic.","real-time traffic,Wireless communication,routing protocols,Vehicle dynamics,marine communication,multi-path routing protocols,Underwater communication,route analysis,Communication networks,Ad hoc networks,Spread spectrum communication,Costs,connectivity analysis,Marine vehicles,Relays,Communication effectiveness,maritime communication network,"
"chapter 6 - broadband albedo","2020","Albedo is a key parameter that is widely used in land surface energy balance studies, mid-to-long-term weather prediction, and global climate change investigation. Remote sensing is an effective way to map the land surface albedo on both the regional and global scales. This chapter first presents the consideration of light incidence and reflection angles to the calculation of surface albedo. Then, the retrieval method of spectral albedo based on bidirectional reflectance models inversion and narrowband-to-broadband albedo conversion is discussed. The next section describes the direct-estimation approaches that retrieve surface broadband albedo directly from single-angle surface reflectance or top-of-atmosphere reflectance, which can be easily adopted in operational global albedo production. After that, the available global land surface albedo remote sensing products and application examples of phenology analysis based on global surface albedo products is briefly reviewed.

"research on risk, safety, and reliability of autonomous ships: a bibliometric review","2023","The safety and reliability of autonomous ships are critical for the successful realization of an autonomous maritime ecosystem. Research and collaboration between governments, industry, and academia are vital in achieving this goal. This paper conducts a bibliometric review of the research on the risk, safety, and reliability of autonomous ships aiming to provide researchers and maritime stakeholders with a structured overview of the topics, development trends, and collaboration networks in this research field. 417 papers published between 2011 and 2022 were identified covering 940 authors, 31 countries, and 227 journals. Three main themes were determined in this research domain: “safety engineering and risk assessment for decision making”, “navigation safety and collision avoidance”, and “cybersecurity risk analysis”. Meanwhile, it was identified that research on cybersecurity in autonomous shipping is moving to overlap with safety, which requires future co-analysis methods. Additionally, the analysis of the most cited 30 papers suggests that further research is needed in the topics of unmanned machinery operation risks, online risk tools, system-theoretic safety analysis, human factor, and the determination of suitable risk acceptance criteria for safety assessment of autonomous ships. Furthermore, the analysis revealed that the development of unambiguous COLREGs regulation is crucial for the development of safe collision avoidance algorithms for MASS. It was identified that the publication by Fan et al., (2020) is a key publication in this research field, while the journals of Ocean Engineering, Reliability Engineering & System Safety, and Safety Science are the key journals publishing on autonomous ship safety and reliability.","Policymaking,Reliability,Safety,Cyber Security,Literature Review,MASS,"
"evidence for intensification of meteorological droughts in oman over the past four decades","2020","Spatial and temporal variability of drought in Oman was assessed for the period 1979–2014 using the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) at both seasonal (3-month) and annual (12-month) timescales. Changes in drought characteristics (e.g. frequency, duration, intensity, severity, and spatial extent) were detected for six distinct climatic regions delineated using a Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Results suggest a statistically significant increase in the frequency and severity of drought during the past four decades. Nonetheless, drought exhibited pronounced decadal variability, with more frequent and severe droughts occurring after 1997/1998. Also, results demonstrate that the areas influenced by extreme and very extreme droughts witnessed a statistically significant increase on the order of 0.13% and 0.18%/decade, respectively, compared to −0.06%/decade for the areas impacted by mild droughts. Spatially, there has been a prevalent drying trend in central and eastern regions of Oman, while a tendency towards wetter conditions was observed in northern Oman (especially in the Batinah plain). This study also investigates the time-varying dependency between climatic drivers of drought and large-scale circulation patterns using the cumulative annual mean (CAM) method. Results indicate an acceleration of drying after 1997/1998, mainly due to the warming sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies over the Atlantic Ocean in recent decades and also the shift of the Pacific Ocean circulation patterns (e.g. PDO and El Nino) from the positive to the negative mode at the end of the 1990s. These configurations are favorable for significant changes in the thermodynamic drivers of drought (i.e. air temperature and relative humidity), but have less influence on aerodynamic drivers (i.e. wind speed). The significant temperature rise in recent decades, combined with a significant decline of rainfall and relative humidity, can explain the prolonged drought episode lasting from 1998 to 2014. A comprehensive assessment of drought variability in a poorly-studied water-stressed region like Oman is of particular concern for stakeholders and policy-makers. This study provides meaningful conclusions and a basis for water resources management, agricultural and energy production, ecological protection, and contribute to more reliable drought mitigation strategies at the regional and national scales.","Rainfall,SPEI,Principal Components Analysis,Circulation patterns,Drought,Oman,"
"analyzing congestion interdependencies of ports and container ship routes in the maritime network infrastructure","2018","Events, such as prolonged congestion in ports or unavailable ship routes in the maritime network, often initiate cascading congestions that block transportation and/or disrupt services over wide areas. Existing traffic flow analysis methods lack the ability to understand the cascading effects of delays in ship routes or how to reduce overall delays in greater maritime areas. Dependency risk graphs have been proposed as a tool for analyzing such cascading events using dependency chains. This paper proposes a risk-based interdependency analysis method capable to detect large-scale traffic congestions between interconnected ports and ship routes in the maritime network and provide solutions to improve flow. Presented dependency risk chains of ports along with graph theory help us analyze ship routes and detect ports that are affected most when other major ports are congested in the maritime network, detect the causes of bottlenecks, and provide valuable info in relieving delays across container ship routes. We apply the proposed method on historical container ship routing data provided by the MarineTraffic company that maintains a comprehensive maritime database worldwide for more than six million users monthly. This application-oriented, interdisciplinary effort culminated in a prototype tool is able to analyze the historical data for container ships in the entire global maritime network and detect congestion dependencies. The tool can be used to identify key shipping routes or ports that: 1) are prone to delays; 2) greatly affect the overall maritime network due to position, connections and risk of congestion; and/or 3) get affected the most by delays in previous route legs.","maritime database worldwide,cascading effects,Transportation,telecommunication network routing,graph,congestion interdependency analysis,centrality,vehicle routing,interconnected ports,transportation,Marine vehicles,sector,Delays,Mathematical model,Maritime,infrastructure,cascading,delay,Containers,ships,dependency risk chains,container,risk-based interdependency analysis method,dependency,flow,congestion,MarineTraffic company,impact,global maritime network infrastructure,sea ports,historical container ship routing data,containers,traffic flow analysis methods,graph theory,large-scale traffic congestion detection,risk,marine communication,Tools,route,Analytical models,port,"
"tcp performance in satellite backhauling for maritime communications: a ns-3 study","2022","In maritime communications, using satellites as the backhaul is an important scenario. Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is the most dominant transport-layer protocol and directly affects user experience. Due to the inherent high propagation delay and random packet loss characteristics of satellite link, it may cause TCP performance be seriously affected using a satellite backhaul. To analyze the TCP performance in satellite backhauling, this paper combines the Long Term Evolution (LTE) model in ns-3 with a geostationary communication satellite model (sns3) to build a practical satellite-based backhauling system. The paper compares the throughput and latency performance of several state-of-the-art TCP variants, namely Cubic, Hybla, Bottleneck Bandwidth and RTT (BBR), Copa and PCC. It is found that the TCP variants exhibit different advantages/disadvantages in different testing scenarios, suggesting that no one is a clear winner in the satellite-backhauling systems. The results also show that the satellite terminal buffer has a great influence on the performance of some TCP variants in the backhauling transmission.","Satellites,dominant transport-layer protocol,TCP,Long Term Evolution model,ns-3 study,geostationary communication satellite model,random packet loss characteristics,Throughput,satellite terminal buffer,transport protocols,ns-3,TCP performance,Wireless communication,state-of-the-art TCP,backhauling transmission,satellite communication,Maritime communications,inherent high propagation delay,telecommunication congestion control,satellite-backhauling systems,TCP variants,satellite backhauling,satellite link,satellite backhaul,satellites,satellite links,User experience,marine communication,Protocols,Transmission Control Protocol,practical satellite-based,Long Term Evolution,sns3,maritime communications,Analytical models,"

"eeg-based maritime object detection for iot-driven surveillance systems in smart ocean","2020","Automated maritime object detection is a significant research challenge in intelligent marine surveillance systems for the Internet of Things (IoT) and smart ocean applications. In particular, ship detection is recognized as one of the core research issues of these IoT-driven intelligent marine surveillance systems. Traditional methods based on machine learning have made some achievements in detection tasks for specific objects. However, the ship objects are relatively small, and they are usually not accurately detected. In this article, we propose an electroencephalography (EEG)-based maritime object detection algorithm for IoT-driven surveillance systems in the smart ocean. For this purpose, we conduct experiments to record the EEG signals of subjects when they are watching the maritime image scenes. With the feature analysis of EEG signals, the event-related potential (ERP) components associated with detecting objects are induced, such as the  $P3$  and  $N2$  components. Employing classification based on linear discriminant analysis (LDA), the area under curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) is used to evaluate the detection accuracy. We use this novel method to determine and identify essential objects and areas from IoT devices, such as digital camera imaging sensors. Our proposed method can not only help to detect small objects accurately using fewer samples but can also be used to reduce the data volume needed to be stored and transmitted in IoT-driven marine surveillance systems.","medical signal processing,surveillance,Electroencephalography,Electroencephalography (EEG),Internet of Things (IoT),ship detection,Internet of Things,Marine vehicles,maritime image scenes,Feature extraction,smart ocean applications,IoT-driven intelligent marine surveillance systems,maritime object detection,automated maritime object detection,ships,electroencephalography-based maritime object detection algorithm,Oceans,object detection,feature extraction,intelligent surveillance systems,IoT-driven marine surveillance systems,IoT devices,image sensors,smart ocean,Object detection,Surveillance,learning (artificial intelligence),electroencephalography,"
"potential of stochastic methods for improving convection-permitting ensemble forecasts of extreme events over the western mediterranean","2021","The design of convection-permitting ensemble prediction systems capable of producing accurate forecasts of disruptive events is an extraordinarily challenging effort. The difficulties associated with the detection of extreme events found at these scales motivates the research of methodologies that efficiently sample relevant uncertainties. This study investigates the potential of multiple techniques to account for model uncertainty. The performance of various stochastic schemes is assessed for an exceptional heavy precipitation episode which occurred in eastern Spain. In particular, the stochastic strategies are compared to a multiphysics approach in terms of both spread and skill. The analyzed techniques include stochastic parameterization perturbation tendency and perturbations to influential parameters within the microphysics scheme. The introduction of stochastic perturbations to the microphysics processes results in a larger ensemble spread throughout the entire simulation. Conversely, modifications to microphysics parameters generate small-scale perturbations that rapidly grow over areas with high convective instability, in contrast to the other methods, which produce more widespread perturbations. A conclusion of specific interest for the western Mediterranean, where deep moist convection and local orography play an important role, is that stochastic methods are shown to outperform a multiphysics-based ensemble for this case, indicating the potential positive impact of stochastic parameterizations for the forecast of extreme events in the region.","Microphysics,Ensemble prediction systems,Stochastic parameterization,Western Mediterranean,Heavy precipitation episodes,"
"data gap analysis of ship and maritime data using meta learning","2021","With the developments in new Internet of Things (IoT) technology, ship owners and managers can access and analyze vast amounts of real-time onboard data. However, data collected from the ship’s engine and navigation information include various types of errors owing to imprecision, bias, sensor failure, or human error caused by manual recording by the ship operator’s hands. Such abnormal data make accurate ship performance prediction and monitoring difficult; thus, the original data need to be carefully refined through data preprocessing. Machine learning models have been used to detect and remove abnormal data; however, this yields inconsistent predictions in results depending on the types of machine learning models used. In this study, a robust data gap analysis method is proposed to detect abnormal data among ship and marine data collected in real time. Data preprocessing, including rule-based data imputation, clustering, denoising, and dimension reduction, is systematically performed; subsequently, a meta-learning model, which is a combination of various machine learning models, is used to predict ship performance and detect its abnormal data. This study compared the performance of single-machine learning models and meta models through various error analysis methods that utilize actual ship operation data. The single machine leading models have various error values depending on types of data and models, while the meta model consistently has values of less than 5% of mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and relative root-mean-square error (RRMSE), showing a Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient(NSE) value of 0.7 or higher. Our proposed data gap analysis framework, including the meta-learning model, can be useful for monitoring the condition of ships, as it can more accurately and robustly classify them as normal or abnormal.","Data preprocessing,Machine learning error measures,Meta learning,Data gap analysis,"

"maritime situation analysis framework: vessel interaction classification and anomaly detection","2015","Maritime domain awareness is critical for protecting sea lanes, ports, harbors, offshore structures like oil and gas rigs and other types of critical infrastructure against common threats and illegal activities.

Limited surveillance resources constrain maritime domain awareness and compromise full security coverage at all times. This situation calls for innovative intelligent systems for interactive situation analysis to assist marine authorities and security personal in their routine surveillance operations. In this article, we propose a novel situation analysis approach to analyze marine traffic data and differentiate various scenarios of vessel engagement for the purpose of detecting anomalies of interest for marine vessels that operate over some period of time in relative proximity to each other. We consider such scenarios as probabilistic processes and analyze complex vessel trajectories using machine learning to model common patterns. Specifically, we represent patterns as left-to-right Hidden Markov Models and classify them using Support Vector Machines. To differentiate suspicious activities from unobjectionable behavior, we explore fusion of data and information, including kinematic features, geospatial features, contextual information and maritime domain knowledge.

"spatial assessment and source identification of heavy metals pollution in surface water using several chemometric techniques","2016","This study presents the determination of the spatial variation and source identification of heavy metal pollution in surface water along the Straits of Malacca using several chemometric techniques. Clustering and discrimination of heavy metal compounds in surface water into two groups (northern and southern regions) are observed according to level of concentrations via the application of chemometric techniques. Principal component analysis (PCA) demonstrates that Cu and Cr dominate the source apportionment in northern region with a total variance of 57.62% and is identified with mining and shipping activities. These are the major contamination contributors in the Straits. Land-based pollution originating from vehicular emission with a total variance of 59.43% is attributed to the high level of Pb concentration in the southern region. The results revealed that one state representing each cluster (northern and southern regions) is significant as the main location for investigating heavy metal concentration in the Straits of Malacca which would save monitoring cost and time.

"holocene surface hydroclimate changes in the indo-pacific warm pool","2018","The Indo-Pacific warm pool (IPWP) is an area hosting key tropical climate processes such as the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD). The tropical climate processes, via various feedback mechanisms, control the surface ocean climate in the Indian Ocean and its surrounding continents on annual to inter-annual timescales. However, little has been known about how the tropical processes are effective forcing climate mechanism over longer timescales. Here we presented a reconstruction of the spatiotemporal pattern of sea surface temperature (SST) with inferred hydroclimate changes since the early Holocene (∼11ka), using proxies of planktonic foraminifer shell Mg/Ca, organic biomarker (TEX86), foraminifer oxygen isotopes, and a terrigenous BIT index measured from a 220 cm long Core BS24 (2.724041°N, 97.010943°E, 1015 m water depth) which was taken offshore of northwest Sumatra in the eastern Indian Ocean. With an age model of 13 AMS 14C dating by the uses of planktonic foraminiferal shells from the core, the TEX86H temperatures of BS24 show as summer-weighted, and reflect integrated thermal effects from the surface to thermocline water, while the Mg/Ca temperature of BS24 better reflects mean annual SST. Our results, along with a regional synthesis of published SST records from the IPWP, suggest that the IPWP has migrated eastwardly since the mid-Holocene (∼5ka). In phase with this eastward migration, the IPWP SSTs have decreased, but the upwelling in the eastern Indian Ocean appears to have been a persistent feature since the mid-Holocene. Our Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis on the compiled IPWP SST records indicates two dominant modes of spatio-temporal variability of surface hydrographes in the IPWP that are attributed to a combined effect of orbital and solar forcing, with expressions analogous to the Indian ocean basin-wide mode (IOBM) and the Indian Ocean dipole model (IOD).","SST,Quaternary,Indo-Pacific warm pool,Mg/Ca,Organic biomarker,TEX,Surface circulation,Monsoon,"
"vulnerability analysis of strategic maritime thoroughfare network","2023","International strategic thoroughfares a critical role in the global shipping network. They are susceptible to various factors, including political and military incidents, ship accidents, and extreme weather conditions. In order to examine the impact of interruptions in international strategic thoroughfares and the expansion of key nodes on the global shipping network, we initially gathered data on significant thoroughfares worldwide and their respective distances. Then, we constructed an undirected and weighted network of strategic thoroughfares. Next, we proceeded to compare and analyze the network nodes using characteristic indices derived from complex network theory. Subsequently, we simulated the interruption of significant thoroughfares and examined the resulting changes in network indices. Ultimately, the findings revealed that the efficiency of the network is most significantly impacted by the Suez Canal and the Strait of Mandeb. The Strait of Malacca, located near the Lombok Strait and Sunda Strait, demonstrated a less pronounced decrease in network efficiency following an attack.

"are meteorological conditions favoring hail precipitation change in southern europe? analysis of the period 1948–2015","2017","In the context of a warming climate, one of the variables currently under investigation is related to the detection of possible changes in hail precipitation. In this work, we analyze hail frequencies in one of the most affected areas by this phenomenon in Europe, southern France. Here, an extensive hail detection network has been in operation since 1988. In general, the detection of hailfall is very uncertain. To overcome the constraints of scarcity and poor standardization of hail detection and monitoring systems, some relationships between hailstorm occurrence and synoptic, mesoscale or thermodynamic atmospheric characteristics have been proposed in different areas. Therefore, we analyzed meteorological fields at synoptic scale that are related to the formation of hailstorms in the study area, i.e., geopotential height at 500hPa, sea level pressure, and lapse-rate between 850 and 500hPa. These fields describe the state of the atmosphere at low and mid levels, and facilitate the evaluation of thermal and dynamic instability. Using the Mann–Kendall test and Sen estimator, we examined trends in the three fields during the period 1948–2015 and their spatial patterns, revealing an evolution toward synoptic environments that favor hail precipitation in the Mediterranean region.","Southern Europe,Trends,Synoptic environments,Hailfalls,"
"coastal sar and plrm altimetry in german bight and west baltic sea","2018","Unlike previous altimetric missions, the CryoSat-2 altimeter features a novel Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) mode that allows higher resolution and more accurate altimeter-derived parameters in the coastal zone, thanks to the reduced along-track footprint. The scope of this study is to quantify regionally the skills of CryoSat-2 SAR altimetry for distances to coast smaller than 10 km, during the mission lifetime and at different time scales. The validated geophysical altimeter parameters are the sea surface height above the ellipsoid, the significant sea wave height and wind speed, all computed at 20 Hz. These have been compared to in situ and regional model data along the coasts of German Bight and West Baltic Sea during a time interval of almost six years, from July 2010 to March 2016, to investigate both instantaneous and seasonal behaviour. From CryoSat-2 FBR (Full Bit Rate) data, a Delay-Doppler processing and waveform retracking tailored specifically to the coastal zone has been carried out, by applying a Hamming window and zero-padding, using an extended vertical swath window in order to mitigate tracker errors. Moreover, a dedicated SAMOSA-based coastal retracker (here referred to as SAMOSA+) has also been implemented. Since one of the highest remaining uncertainties in the altimeter parameters estimated in coastal shallow waters arises from residual errors in the applied range and geophysical corrections, innovative and high resolution solutions for ocean tide model, geoid, mean sea surface and wet tropospheric correction have been selected. As CryoSat-2 SAR and LRM (Low Rate Mode) modes are not collocated in time, in order to quantify the improvement in the coastal zone with respect to pulse-limited altimetry, 20 Hz PLRM (pseudo-LRM) data from CryoSat-2 FBR were built and retracked, adopting the ALES adaptive sub-waveform approach, with a numerical Brown-based retracker, here referred to as TALES. The cross-validation proves the good consistency between PLRM and SAR sea level anomaly in the coastal zone. The regional ocean model (BSH) shows the highest agreement with the SAR sea level anomaly, with a standard deviation of the differences (stdd) of 24 cm, whereas the corresponding value with respect to PLRM is 55 cm. Distance to coast plots show that land contamination begins to affect sea level and wave measurements at 2 km from the coast in SAR and at 3.5 km in PLRM TALES. The analysis of monthly mean time-series shows that SAR Altimetry is able to measure the sea level monthly mean in the coastal zone of the region of interest, during the entire mission, more precisely than PLRM. The cross-validation against in situ data also proves the higher accuracy of SAR SAMOSA+ compared to PLRM TALES in the coastal zone, with average SLA stdd of 4.4 cm and 8.4 cm respectively.","Sea level,SAR altimetry,CryoSat-2,Coastal altimetry,Retracking,In situ validation,"
"dispersant application increases adverse long-term effects of oil on shrimp larvae (pandalus borealis) after a six hour exposure","2020","The application of chemical dispersants is one option of oil spill response (OSR). Here, Northern shrimp (Pandalus borealis) larvae were experimentally exposed for short periods (6 h and 1 h) to a realistic concentration of chemically dispersed oil (CDO) (~10 mg L−1 THC), mechanically dispersed oil (MDO) (~7 mg L−1 THC), and dispersant only (D). A control (C) with seawater served as reference. Short-term effects on survival and feeding were examined right after exposure and longer-term consequences on survival, feeding, growth and development following 30 days of recovery. Both exposure durations provoked long lasting effects on larval fitness, with 1 h exposure leading to minor effects on most of the selected endpoints. The 6 h exposure affected all endpoints with more adverse impacts after exposure to CDO. This study provides important data for assessing the best OSR option relevant to NEBA (Net Environmental Benefit Analysis).","Oil spill,Survival,Zooplankton,Growth,Development,Feeding,"
"effects of climate variability and change on snowpack hydrological processes in finland","2015","This study evaluated the effects of climate variability and change on snowpack hydrological processes (SHPs) in terms of liquid water refreezing, water storage as snow water equivalent (SWE) and outflow as total liquid water leaving the snowpack induced by snowmelt flux (melt water releasing from the snowpack after its maximum liquid water retention capacity is reached) and/or rainfall in Finland during the past 100years. Long-term (>100years) daily precipitation and temperature records from three meteorological stations (Sodankylä in northern, Kajaani in central and Kaisaniemi in southern Finland) were used in an empirical snowmelt temperature-index model to simulate different SHPs. The Mann–Kendall non-parametric test was used to detect statistically significant (p<0.05) trends, the sequential t-test analysis of regime shifts (STARS) to determine cold–mild and wet–dry climate modes, Pearson's coefficient (r) to measure temperature-precipitation and SWE correlations, and Spearman's rank correlation (rho) to identify linkages of these variables to well-known atmospheric circulation patterns (ACPs) over the Northern Hemisphere (e.g. the Arctic Oscillation). Observed mean annual temperature significantly warmed, by a rate of 0.01°Cyear−1, at both Kaisaniemi during 1845–2011 and Sodankylä during 1908–2011, which was also associated with a shift from cold to mild climate in 1930 at Kaisaniemi and in 1988 at Sodankylä. However, mean annual temperature showed no clear trend at Kajaani, which was confirmed by the existence of periodicities in cold–mild climatic modes. Conversely, observed total annual precipitation decreased by 0.8mmyear−1 (p<0.05) only at Kajaani during 1903–2008, which was in accordance with the climate shift from wet to dry mode in 1939. The simulated peak annual SWE significantly decreased in the range 0.57–1.47mmyear−1 at all three stations studied during the 20th century, with the highest rate at Sodankylä. Comparisons of simulated 1-day to 10-day peak outflow indicated that snowmelt flux influenced simulated peak snowpack outflow much more than rainfall. Hence, the magnitude of simulated annual 1- and 10-day peak outflows decreased by 0.055±0.01 and 0.45±0.25mmyear−1 (p<0.05), respectively, in Finland during the last century. Moreover, simulated annual 1-day peak outflow timing significantly shifted to 12–28days earlier, while simulated annual 10-day peak outflow timing shifted to 8–40 days earlier (p<0.05). These results indicate that the snow resource in Finland has significantly declined during the past 100years under climate variability and change, partly controlled by the Arctic Oscillation, East Atlantic/West Russia, and East Atlantic patterns across the country.","Atmospheric circulation,Regime shifts,Snowpack hydrological processes,Finland,Climate change,Trend analysis,"
"threat assessment of the maritime targets based on dynamic bayesian networks","2022","In order to efficiently and accurately grasp and predict the state of the maritime target of the enemy, it is necessary to conduct the threat assessment of the maritime targetâ€™s state. The current threat assessment methods for maritime targets mainly rely on the commanderâ€™s judgment based on human experience, and it is difficult to adapt to the complex and real-time changing requirements of information sources in the war. This paper fully considers battlefield combat factors, selects target features and performs fuzzy processing, using dynamic Bayesian network method to establish a threat assessment model for maritime targets. Then we combine the calculation examples to analyze two types of maritime targets based on dynamic and static Bayesian networks. The target threat assessment methods are compared and analyzed.

"a virtual phase-lead impedance stability control strategy for the maritime vscâ€“hvdc system","2018","In the maritime VSC-HVDC system supplying power to passive network on the island, the dc side of the system is prone to oscillation and even instability, which is resulted from the negative incremental input resistance characteristic of the inverter station. First, a virtual phase-lead impedance stability control strategy aiming at rectifier station is proposed. This control strategy can effectively mitigate the dc-side oscillation of the VSC-HVDC system without affecting the load performance of the inverter station. Then, the dc impedance model of the VSC-HVDC system is built, including the output impedance of the rectifier station, dc cable impedance, and the input impedance of the inverter station. In addition, the oscillation mechanism of the VSC-HVDC system is analyzed by impedance-based Nyquist stability criterion. The reason why rectifier station fails to mitigate the dc-side oscillation using traditional virtual resistance stability control is that the output impedance of the rectifier station exhibits negative damping characteristic outside the control bandwidth of voltage outer loop. For this issue, the proposed control strategy can correct the output impedance of the rectifier station to exhibit positive damping characteristic outside the control bandwidth of voltage outer loop, thus mitigating the dc-side oscillation of the VSC-HVDC system. Finally, simulation and experiment results validate the proposed control strategy and analysis.","rectifiers,maritime VSC-HVDC system,Impedance,negative incremental input resistance characteristic,rectifier station exhibits negative damping characteristic,voltage outer loop,load performance,electric current control,Impedance-based Nyquist stability criterion,Power system stability,Power conversion,power grids,virtual phase-lead impedance,inverter station,control bandwidth,power system stability,Stability criteria,virtual phase-lead impedance stability control strategy,HVDC power transmission,damping,Rectifiers,electric impedance,island power supply,invertors,output impedance,voltage control,Nyquist stability,maritime VSCâ€“HVDC system,dc impedance model,input impedance,dc cable impedance,impedance-based Nyquist stability criterion,HVDC power convertors,"

"a taxonomy and survey of cyber-physical intrusion detection approaches for vehicles","2019","With the growing threat of cyber and cyber-physical attacks against automobiles, drones, ships, driverless pods and other vehicles, there is also a growing need for intrusion detection approaches that can facilitate defence against such threats. Vehicles tend to have limited processing resources and are energy-constrained. So, any security provision needs to abide by these limitations. At the same time, attacks against vehicles are very rare, often making knowledge-based intrusion detection systems less practical than behaviour-based ones, which is the reverse of what is seen in conventional computing systems. Furthermore, vehicle design and implementation can differ wildly between different types or different manufacturers, which can lead to intrusion detection designs that are vehicle-specific. Equally importantly, vehicles are practically defined by their ability to move, autonomously or not. Movement, as well as other physical manifestations of their operation may allow cyber security breaches to lead to physical damage, but can also be an opportunity for detection. For example, physical sensing can contribute to more accurate or more rapid intrusion detection through observation and analysis of physical manifestations of a security breach. This paper presents a classification and survey of intrusion detection systems designed and evaluated specifically on vehicles and networks of vehicles. Its aim is to help identify existing techniques that can be adopted in the industry, along with their advantages and disadvantages, as well as to identify gaps in the literature, which are attractive and highly meaningful areas of future research.","Intrusion detection,VANET,Unmanned aerial vehicles,Robotic land vehicles,Cyber-physical systems,Vehicular networks,Aircraft,Vehicles,Cyber security,Driverless pods,Automobiles,"
"spatio-temporal detection for dengue outbreaks in the central region of malaysia using climatic drivers at mesoscale and synoptic scale","2022","The disease dengue is associated with both mesoscale and synoptic scale meteorology. However, previous studies for south-east Asia have found a very limited association between synoptic variables and the reported number of dengue cases. Hence there is an urgent need to establish a more clear association with dengue incidence rates and the most relevant meteorological variables in order to institute an early warning system. This article develops a rigorous Bayesian modelling framework to identify the most important covariates and their lagged effects for constructing an early warning system for the Central Region of Malaysia where the case rates have increased substantially in the recent past. Our modelling includes multiple synoptic scale Niño indices, which are related to the phenomenon of El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), along with other relevant mesoscale environmental measurements and an unobserved variable derived from reanalysis data. An empirically well validated hierarchical Bayesian spatio-temporal is used to build a probabilistic early warning system for detecting an upcoming dengue epidemic. Our study finds a 46.87% increase in dengue cases due to one degree increase in the central equatorial Pacific sea surface temperature with a lag time of six weeks. We discover the existence of a mild association with relative risk 0.9774 (CI: 0.9602, 0.9947) between the rate of cases and a distant lagged cooling effect in the region of coastal South America related to a phenomenon called El Niño Modoki. The Bayesian model also establishes that the synoptic meteorological drivers can enhance short-term early detection of dengue outbreaks and these can also potentially be used to provide longer-term forecasts.","early warning system,ENSO,dengue,Bayesian spatio-temporal model,El Niño Modoki,BYM2,"
"aidoart: ai-augmented automation for devops, a model-based framework for continuous development in cyber–physical systems","2022","The advent of complex Cyber–Physical Systems (CPSs) creates the need for more efficient engineering processes. Recently, DevOps promoted the idea of considering a closer continuous integration between system development (including its design) and operational deployment. Despite their use being still currently limited, Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques are suitable candidates for improving such system engineering activities (cf. AIOps). In this context, AIDOaRT is a large European collaborative project that aims at providing AI-augmented automation capabilities to better support the modeling, coding, testing, monitoring, and continuous development of CPSs. The project proposes to combine Model Driven Engineering principles and techniques with AI-enhanced methods and tools for engineering more trustable CPSs. The resulting framework will (1) enable the dynamic observation and analysis of system data collected at both runtime and design time and (2) provide dedicated AI-augmented solutions that will then be validated in concrete industrial cases. This paper describes the main research objectives and underlying paradigms of the AIDOaRt project. It also introduces the conceptual architecture and proposed approach of the AIDOaRt overall solution.

"analysis of effectiveness of fire safety in machinery spaces","2019","The primary cause of machinery space fires is cited as the release of flammable oil mist contacting unprotected hot surfaces. With this being common knowledge why do we continue to see this type of incident reoccurring on ships carrying thousands of passengers to precarious destinations? We review regulatory and Class requirements with respect to fire safety, Formal Safety Assessment (FSA) as a rule-making instrument of the IMO, accident investigation recommendations involving fire, fire safety technology, and research literature. For each constituent of fire safety control, the paper aims to determine the preferred strategies for accident prevention and their relative cost effectiveness. Subsequently, the cost effectiveness of the current safety approach is established. This review found that fire prevention could be made more cost effective if its scope was broadened beyond the detection of proximate events occurring immediately before ignition. The findings suggest that more cost-effective safety measures can be developed by addressing systemic causes of fire. Removal of the systemic causal factors of fire from the equation, means we can address fire safety prior to the moments before ignition when the point of no return can unwittingly be passed. The paper suggests directions of how this can be achieved.","Safety barriers,Marine safety,Fire prevention,Fire safety,Machinery space,"
"quadrennial variability and trends of surface ozone across china during 2015–2018: a regional approach","2021","China has undergone headlong economic development, yielding a secondary air pollutant ‘ozone’, which has stirred up worldwide concerns. This study evaluates quadrennial, and seasonal surface ozone variations, ozone trends along with its significance through seasonal and deseasonal datasets, and ozone-NO2 correlation to codify a precedent for pollution control policies. China is divided into eight regions namely: Northeast (NE), Northwest (NW), North (N), East (E), Central (C), South (S), Southwest (SW), and Tibet (T), to exploit four-years data via (a) ozone 8-hr moving averages (O3-8hr), (b) hourly ozone monthly mean (O3-MM), (c) hourly ozone daily maximum MM (O3-DM-MM), (d) mean of the daily maximum 8-hr average ozone (MDA8-O3), (e) hourly ozone averages (O3-1hr), and (f) hourly NO2 averages (NO2-1hr), respectively. Quadrennial variations show distinct regions (i) Northeast with daily upraised value of 164.59 μg/m3, (ii) North possessing increased monthly variation of 125 μg/m3, and (iii) Tibet containing maximum yearly value of 79.81 μg/m3, respectively. Seasonal variations outpace North and South regions. The highest and lowest values of seasonal variations in North region are 135.61 μg/m3, and 23.96 μg/m3 during summer and winter, while maximum values of South region are 87.98 μg/m3 in autumn. In trend analysis, the seasonal dataset highlights higher ozone values during autumn, i.e. 74.12 μg/m3 and 141.96 μg/m3 for South and Central regions, respectively. In the meantime, the deseasonal dataset reveals the presence of increasing ozone trends in all studied regions. In assessing statistical significance by Mann-Kendall test, seasonal dataset rolls out statistically insignificant trends with an exception of South region. Meanwhile, deseasonal dataset projects statistically significant trends in all the eight regions. Lastly, two continual regions North and South are selected to determine ozone-NO2 relationship. The multiple analytical approaches unveil that O3 has increased by 20.86%, 14.05% and 12.64% in North, Central and South regions. The dissimilar climate, land cover modifications, precursors transportation and vehicular emissions might be some of the rationales to give rise to regional ozone variations. Therefore, we suggest revamping of emissions control policies and their precise implementation to abate ozone pollution.","Trend significance,Deseasonal dataset,Surface ozone,NO,Seasonal variations,Quadrennial,"
"aerosols heat up the himalayan climate","2023","The impact of aerosols, especially the absorbing aerosols, in the Himalayan region is important for climate. We closely examine ground-based high-quality observations of aerosol characteristics including radiative forcing from several locations in the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP), the Himalayan foothills and the Tibetan Plateau, relatively poorly studied regions with several sensitive ecosystems of global importance, as well as highly vulnerable large populations. This paper presents a state-of-the-art treatment of the warming that arises from these particles, using a combination of new measurements and modeling techniques. This is a first-time analysis of its kind, including ground-based observations, satellite data, and model simulations, which reveals that the aerosol radiative forcing efficiency (ARFE) in the atmosphere is clearly high over the IGP and the Himalayan foothills (80–135 Wm−2 per unit aerosol optical depth (AOD)), with values being greater at higher elevations. AOD is >0.30 and single scattering albedo (SSA) is ∼0.90 throughout the year over this region. The mean ARFE is 2–4 times higher here than over other polluted sites in South and East Asia, owing to higher AOD and aerosol absorption (i.e., lower SSA). Further, the observed annual mean aerosol-induced atmospheric heating rates (0.5–0.8 Kelvin/day), which are significantly higher than previously reported values for the region, imply that the aerosols alone could account for >50 % of the total warming (aerosols + greenhouse gases) of the lower atmosphere and surface over this region. We demonstrate that the current state-of-the-art models used in climate assessments significantly underestimate aerosol-induced heating, efficiency and warming over the Hindu Kush – Himalaya – Tibetan Plateau (HKHTP) region, indicating a need for a more realistic representation of aerosol properties, especially of black carbon and other aerosols. The significant, regionally coherent aerosol-induced warming that we observe in the high altitudes of the region, is a significant factor contributing to increasing air temperature, observed accelerated retreat of the glaciers, and changes in the hydrological cycle and precipitation patterns over this region. Thus, aerosols are heating up the Himalayan climate, and will remain a key factor driving climate change over the region.","Himalayas,South Asia,Model simulations,Radiative effects,Atmospheric aerosols,Observations,"

"the isopod eurydice spinigera and the chaetognath flaccisagitta enflata: how habitat affects bioaccumulation of metals in predaceous marine invertebrates","2018","We analyzed the concentrations of 20 trace elements in Eurydice spinigera (Isopoda) and Flaccisagitta enflata (Chaetognatha), which represent a hyperbenthic and a zooplanktonic marine species respectively, sharing the same predaceous feeding strategy, from a highly productive coastal region (Ligurian Sea, Northwestern Mediterranean). The same elements were also quantified in marine sediments, where geological anomalies were found for arsenic, chromium and nickel. Metal transfer seems to be deeply influenced by different habitats. The carnivorous isopod E. spinigera, which spends most of its lifetime on the seabed, was found to have the highest concentrations of most trace elements, such as Al, As, Cd, Ce, Cr, Fe, La, Mn, Ni, Pb, Se, V and Zn, and consequently have the highest bioaccumulation factors (BAFs). Moreover, the estimation of biota sediment accumulation factors (BSAFs) revealed that cadmium, copper and zinc concentrations were higher in the isopod than in the sediment. Conversely, in the carnivorous chaetognath F. enflata, which is not a benthonic species, the highest levels of copper and tin were found. Moreover, arsenic speciation analysis confirmed the presence of inorganic As (III+V) in E. spinigera. In the context of utilizing a marine organism as a bio-indicator of metal transfer, it is crucial to consider both feeding behavior and feeding habitat.","Mediterranean sea,Bioaccumulation factors,Trace elements,Coastal environment,"
"multi-label classification for ais data anomaly detection using wavelet transform","2022","Thanks to the Automatic Identification System (AIS), ships and other maritime equipment are able to communicate with each other, for example, by sending information about their position. This solution allows for early collision detection when two or more ships are on a collision course. In the newer version of AIS, a satellite infrastructure is used to extend the communication range. Unfortunately, satellite AIS deals with so-called packet collision effect: since there is a problem with synchronizing AIS data coming from multiple terrestrial areas, a single satellite may receive several AIS messages at the same time and be unable to correctly process them, causing the data to get lost or garbled. In this article, a machine learning based framework for detecting the incorrect AIS data is presented. In this approach, after the first stage (clustering), a dedicated anomaly detection algorithm searches for damaged AIS messages and conducts multi-label classification (with Random Forest and wavelet transform) to decide which fields of such message requires further correction. The results of measuring the effectiveness of the proposed approach using real AIS data are presented.","telecommunication security,Clustering algorithms,incorrect AIS data,single satellite,Anomaly detection,Wavelet transforms,anomaly detection,random forests,collision course,Marine vehicles,Machine learning,damaged AIS messages,Data analysis,dedicated anomaly detection algorithm searches,satellite communication,ships,wavelet transform,pattern classification,random forest,Classification algorithms,multiple terrestrial areas,pattern clustering,machine learning based framework,Artificial intelligence,multi-label classification,multilabel classification,wavelet transforms,satellite infrastructure,AIS data anomaly detection,maritime equipment,communication range,Trajectory,marine communication,Labeling,early collision detection,AIS data analysis,packet collision effect,satellite AIS deals,"

"a wavelet-based deep learning pipeline for efficient covid-19 diagnosis via ct slices","2022","The quick diagnosis of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) disease is vital to prevent its propagation and improve therapeutic outcomes. Computed tomography (CT) is believed to be an effective tool for diagnosing COVID-19, however, the CT scan contains hundreds of slices that are complex to be analyzed and could cause delays in diagnosis. Artificial intelligence (AI) especially deep learning (DL), could facilitate and speed up COVID-19 diagnosis from such scans. Several studies employed DL approaches based on 2D CT images from a single view, nevertheless, 3D multiview CT slices demonstrated an excellent ability to enhance the efficiency of COVID-19 diagnosis. The majority of DL-based studies utilized the spatial information of the original CT images to train their models, though, using spectral–temporal information could improve the detection of COVID-19. This article proposes a DL-based pipeline called CoviWavNet for the automatic diagnosis of COVID-19. CoviWavNet uses a 3D multiview dataset called OMNIAHCOV. Initially, it analyzes the CT slices using multilevel discrete wavelet decomposition (DWT) and then uses the heatmaps of the approximation levels to train three ResNet CNN models. These ResNets use the spectral–temporal information of such images to perform classification. Subsequently, it investigates whether the combination of spatial information with spectral–temporal information could improve the diagnostic accuracy of COVID-19. For this purpose, it extracts deep spectral–temporal features from such ResNets using transfer learning and integrates them with deep spatial features extracted from the same ResNets trained with the original CT slices. Then, it utilizes a feature selection step to reduce the dimension of such integrated features and use them as inputs to three support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. To further validate the performance of CoviWavNet, a publicly available benchmark dataset called SARS-COV-2-CT-Scan is employed. The results of CoviWavNet have demonstrated that using the spectral–temporal information of the DWT heatmap images to train the ResNets is superior to utilizing the spatial information of the original CT images. Furthermore, integrating deep spectral–temporal features with deep spatial features has enhanced the classification accuracy of the three SVM classifiers reaching a final accuracy of 99.33% and 99.7% for the OMNIAHCOV and SARS-COV-2-CT-Scan datasets respectively. These accuracies verify the outstanding performance of CoviWavNet compared to other related studies. Thus, CoviWavNet can help radiologists in the rapid and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 diagnosis.","Convolutional neural networks,Discrete wavelet transform (DWT),Deep learning,Computed tomography (CT),COVID-19,ResNet,"
