"detecting infrared maritime targets overwhelmed in sun glitters by antijitter spatiotemporal saliency","2019","When detecting infrared maritime targets on sunny days, strong sun glitters can lower the detection accuracy tremendously. To this problem, we proposed a robust antijitter spatiotemporal saliency generation with parallel binarization (ASSGPB) method. Its main contribution is to facilitate to improve the infrared maritime target detection accuracy in this situation. The ASSGPB algorithm exploits the target's spatial saliency and temporal consistency to separate real targets from clutter areas. The ASSGPB first corrects image intensity distribution with a central inhibition difference of Gaussian filter. Then, a self-defined spatiotemporal saliency map (STSM) generator is used to generate an STSM in five consecutive frames while compensating interframe jitters by a joint block matching. Finally, a parallel binarization method is adopted to segment real targets in STSM while keeping full target areas. To evaluate the performance of ASSGPB, we captured eight different image sequences (20420 frames in total) that were significantly contaminated by strong sun glitters. The ASSGPB realized 100% detection rate and 0.45% false alarm rate in these data sets, greatly outperforming four state-of-the-art algorithms. Thus, a great applicability of ASSGPB has been verified through our experiments.","parallel binarization method,Spatiotemporal phenomena,Generators,target detection,spatiotemporal phenomena,image intensity distribution,Gaussian filter,ASSGPB algorithm,Sun,image matching,antijitter spatiotemporal saliency generation with parallel binarization method,maritime surveillance,object detection,infrared maritime target detection accuracy,maritime targets,Gaussian processes,STSM,jitter,image filtering,Image segmentation,infrared imaging,image sequences,infrared detectors,Jitter,Visualization,Object detection,Imaging,spatiotemporal saliency map generator,image segmentation,"
"wavelet-based texture features for the classification of age classes in a maritime pine forest","2015","This letter evaluates the potential of wavelet-based texture modeling for the classification of stand age in a managed maritime pine forest using very high resolution panchromatic and multispectral PLEIADES data. A cross-validation approach based on stand age reference data is used to compare classification performances obtained from different multivariate models (multivariate Gaussian, spherically invariant random vector (SIRV)-based models, and Gaussian copulas) and from co-occurrence matrices. Results show that the multivariate modeling of the spatial dependence of wavelet coefficients (particularly when using the Gaussian SIRV model) outperforms the use of features derived from co-occurrence matrices. Simultaneously adding features representing the color dependence and leveling the dominant orientation in anisotropic forest stands enhances the classification performances. These results confirm the ability of such wavelet-based multivariate models to efficiently capture the textural properties of very high resolution forest data and open up perspectives for their use in the mapping of monospecific forest structure variables.","Gaussian copulas,image texture analysis,Vectors,image resolution,multispectral PLEIADES data,Spatial resolution,Feature extraction,Forest structure,Image color analysis,geophysical image processing,vegetation mapping,very high resolution,maritime pine forest,spherically invariant random vector-based model,wavelet,wavelet-based texture modeling,age classes,Data models,feature extraction,image classification,image texture,Gaussian processes,stand age reference data,multivariate Gaussian model,very high resolution panchromatic data,Vegetation,cooccurrence matrices,Computational modeling,"
"maritime anomaly detection using gaussian process active learning","2012","A model of normal vessel behaviours is useful for detecting illegal, suspicious, or unsafe behaviour; such as vessel theft, drugs smuggling, people trafficking or poor sailing. This work presents a data-driven non-parametric Bayesian model, based on Gaussian Processes, to model normal shipping behaviour. This model is learned from Automatic Identification System (AIS) data and uses an Active Learning paradigm to select an informative subsample of the data to reduce the computational complexity of training. The resultant model allows a measure of normality to be calculated for each newly-observed transmission according to its velocity given its current latitude and longitude. Using this measure of normality, ships can be identified as potentially anomalous and prioritised for further investigation. The model performance is assessed by its ability to detect artificially generated AIS anomalies at locations around the United Kingdom. Finally, the model is demonstrated on case studies from artificial and real vessel data to detect anomalies in unusual tracks.","identification technology,data mining,automatic identification system data,data-driven nonparametric Bayesian model,Bayes methods,Marine vehicles,normal vessel behaviours,unsafe behaviour detection,informative data subsampling,Accuracy,illegal behaviour detection,Bayesian methods,sampling methods,real vessel data,Gaussian process active learning,United Kingdom,Data models,Gaussian processes,artificially generated AIS anomalies detection,maritime anomaly detection,artificial vessel data,training computational complexity,training,Training,behavioural sciences,computational complexity,normal shipping behaviour model,Computational modeling,suspicious behaviour detection,learning (artificial intelligence),newly-observed transmission,AIS data,"
"fusion detection algorithm of maritime radar and electro-optical pod for complex sea conditions","2023","In order to improve the perceptual capability of Unmanned Surface Vessels (USVs) in complex sea conditions, a fusion detection algorithm has been developed that combines maritime radar and electro-optical (EO) pod. This algorithm integrates the positional state of the USV, class information of the maritime target obtained through a vision-based target detection algorithm, and processed maritime radar information. By using Gaussian and morphological filtering, the fusion of position state information from the USV, EO pod data, and maritime radar data is achieved. This effectively mitigates the negative impact of environmental factors, such as waves and water mist, on target detection. A cooperative sensing process between the maritime radar and EO pod is proposed to fuse the data obtained from both sources, resulting in accurate comprehensive target information. Experimental results show that the fusion algorithm achieves an average accuracy of 80.24% and a detection rate of 74.7%, enabling precise detection of maritime targets, including their distance, speed, and category. This enhanced perceptual capability is essential for USVs operating in complex maritime environments, enabling better decision-making and navigation performance.","maritime radar data,class information,accurate comprehensive target information,sensor fusion,marine radar,electro-optical pod,vision-based target detection algorithm,fusion algorithm,enhanced perceptual capability,target detection,complex maritime environments,positional state,combines maritime radar,fusion detection algorithm,object detection,complex sea conditions,Collaboration,synergistic sensing,Surface morphology,Radar,position state information,Unmanned Surface Vessels,unmanned surface vehicles,detection rate,maritime radar information,Radar imaging,USVs operating,Object detection,Signal processing algorithms,EO pod,maritime target,multi-sensor fusion,Radar detection,"

"vessel detection and classification: an integrated maritime surveillance system in the tyrrhenian sea","2010","In recent years a number of organizations, both national and international, have put significant efforts in developing knowledge-based integrated maritime surveillance (IMS) systems. The final aim is to have a clear picture of the position, classification, identification and movement of cooperative and non-cooperative targets entering and leaving the 200 nautical miles limit of the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). Each sensor (i.e. satellite-based, ground-based, shipborne or airborne) has its own task and, in such a context, high frequency (HF) surface wave (SW) radars are inexpensive tools for long range early warning applications in open waters. They allow maximizing the effectiveness in dealing with fisheries protection, drug interdiction, illegal immigration, terrorist threats, search and rescue tasks. This paper focuses on the possibility of combining automatic identification system (AIS) data with HFSWR data for vessel detection and classification purposes. Three algorithms for target detection in compound Gaussian HF sea clutter are presented and their performance evaluated. The combined use of AIS plots provided by cooperative targets can allow the operator to discriminate non-cooperative targets and possible threats.

"an unsupervised reconstruction-based fault detection algorithm for maritime components","2019","In recent years, the reliability and safety requirements of ship systems have increased drastically. This has prompted a paradigm shift toward the development of prognostics and health management (PHM) approaches for these systems' critical maritime components. In light of harsh environmental conditions with varying operational loads, and a lack of fault labels in the maritime industry generally, any PHM solution for maritime components should include independent and intelligent fault detection algorithms that can report faults automatically. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised reconstruction-based fault detection algorithm for maritime components. The advantages of the proposed algorithm are verified on five different data sets of real operational run-to-failure data provided by a highly regarded industrial company. Each data set is subject to a fault at an unknown time step. In addition, different magnitudes of random white Gaussian noise are applied to each data set in order to create several real-life situations. The results suggest that the algorithm is highly suitable to be included as part of a pure data-driven diagnostics approach in future end-to-end PHM system solutions.","maritime components,ship systems,Prediction algorithms,unsupervised learning,reliability,Maintenance engineering,deep learning,ships,Prognostics and health management,random white Gaussian noise,Gaussian noise,Fault detection,Machine learning algorithms,Degradation,condition monitoring,maritime industry,Automatic fault detection,Signal processing algorithms,remaining life assessment,intelligent fault detection algorithm,unsupervised reconstruction-based fault detection algorithm,prognostics and health management,fault diagnosis,"
"a novel model for ship trajectory anomaly detection based on gaussian mixture variational autoencoder","2023","The use of traditional methods in anomaly detection of multi-class ship trajectories showed some limitations in terms of robustness and learning ability of trajectory features. In view of this, an anomaly detection model for ship trajectory data based on Gaussian Mixture Variational Autoencoder (GMVAE) is proposed in this study using an unsupervised classification method. The proposed model modifies Variational Autoencoder (VAE) by changing the inferential distribution of prior distribution and approximate posterior to the Gaussian mixture model. A high-dimensional hidden space is constructed to learn the features of multi-class trajectory data, and the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) method is applied to measure the error between the reconstructed trajectory and the original trajectory in order to judge whether the ship trajectory is abnormal. The Automatic Identification System (AIS) data from the US coastal areas are used to verify the proposed model, and the results are compared with other commonly used models in a manually labeled dataset. The research results indicate that the detection rate of the proposed model is 91.26%, and the false alarm rate is 0.68%, which performs the best. Using the Gaussian mixture model to describe the distribution of hidden space can improve the learning ability of multi-class trajectories of VAE, thus increasing the robustness of the model. This research can provide technical support for ship trajectory data analysis and risk management of maritime transportation.","Trajectory,anomaly detection of ship trajectory,Clustering algorithms,Classification algorithms,Mathematical models,gaussian mixture variational autoencoder (gmvae),unsupervised learning,Gaussian distribution,Marine vehicles,Artificial neural networks,intelligent transportation,AIS,"

"deep learning aided beam vector assignment for massive mimo maritime communication considering location information and handover impact","2022","Location aided beamforming (LAB) has been proposed as a potential solution to fast beam vector (BV) selection for massive multi-input multi-output (M-MIMO) maritime communication systems. However, the existing LAB schemes hardly consider the impact from handover. In this paper, we propose to apply the Gaussian anomaly detection (GAD) to improve the system performance, particularly in the handover zone, by exploiting the information of sea lane and locations of the user equipment (UE). Furthermore, inspired by the rationale of deep learning (DL) aided image processing methods, we first transform the BV assignment problem to a location-based artificial gray value classification problem, and then utilize a convolutional deep belief networks (CDBN) to predict the BV indices from a predefined codebook constituted by location-related feature matrices. In addition, we exploit GAD to rectify the training data of CDBN, such that the prediction on BV assignments can be more accurate to achieve a higher capacity than known methods. Finally, an extensive comparison with selected existing schemes through simulations demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.","Convolutional deep belief network (CDBN),Maritime communication,Deep learning (DL),Massive multiple input multiple output (M-MIMO),Gaussian anomaly detection (GAD),"

"fast detection of small targets in high-resolution maritime radars by feature normalization and fusion","2022","Joint exploitation of multiple features is a recognized way to implement the effective detection of small targets on the sea in high-resolution maritime radars at the dwelling mode. The tri-feature-based and feature-compression-based detectors use the time-consuming convex hull learning and decision.

From the fitted distribution, each feature is normalized to approximate the standard Gaussian distribution by a nonlinear transformation. In the seven-dimensional normalized feature space, an analytical method is given to calculate the optimal weights of feature fusion by the maximization of the interclass distance of the two-class samples. Owing to the normalization of the seven features, the feature fusion loss is significantly reduced comparing with the direct fusion of seven features.

"maritime target tracking from an airborne multi-channel radar","2022","Detection and tracking of small maritime targets using high-resolution airborne radar is a difficult problem due to the non-stationary and non-Gaussian nature of sea clutter.

Specifically, a nonadaptive detector is derived by the Wald or Rao test when the clutter texture and speckle covariance matrix are assumed to be known in the first step; then the clutter parameters known in the first step are estimated, and the true parameters of the detector obtained in the first step are replaced with the estimated values. Theoretical proof and experimental verification indicate that the two proposed detectors have the constant false alarm property with regard to the clutter speckle covariance matrix and the clutter average power. Numerical results on simulated and measured radar data show that the proposed Rao-based detector outperforms its competitors and has stronger robustness to the signal mismatch compared to the proposed Wald-based detector.","Wald-based detector,covariance matrices,speckle,marine radar,detection performance degradation,complex Gaussian speckle,Wald test,radar detection,Lognormal texture,radar clutter,clutter texture,Gaussian clutter,adaptive radar,clutter speckle covariance matrix,sea clutter,adaptive detectors,radar targets,Covariance matrices,object detection,adaptive radar target detectors,Rao-based detector,maritime radar targets,Radar clutter,Radar,radar signal processing,clutter average power,Gaussian noise,Clutter,clutter parameters,nonGaussian sea clutter,Rao-based detection,Rao test,Gaussian distribution,Radar detection,Detectors,NonGaussian sea clutter,Speckle,"

"ship trajectory prediction based on machine learning and deep learning: a systematic review and methods analysis","2023","Ship trajectory prediction based on Automatic Identification System (AIS) data has attracted increasing interest as it helps prevent collision accidents and eliminate potential navigational conflicts. Therefore, it is necessary and urgent to conduct a systematic analysis of all the prediction methods to help reveal their advantages to ensure safety at sea in different scenarios. It is particularly important and significant within the context of unmanned ships forming a new hybrid maritime traffic together with manned ships in the future. This paper aims to conduct a comparative analysis of the up-to-date ship trajectory prediction algorithms based on machine learning and deep learning methods. To do so, five classical machine learning methods (i.e., Kalman Filter, Gaussian Process Regression, Support Vector Regression, Random Forest, and Back Propagation Network) and eight deep learning methods (i.e., Recurrent Neural Networks, Long Short-Term Memory, Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory, Gate Recurrent Unit, Bi-directional Gate Recurrent Unit, Sequence to Sequence, Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network, and Transformer) are thoroughly analysed and compared from the algorithm essence and applications to excavate their features and adaptability for manned and unmanned ships. The findings reveal the characteristics of various prediction methods and provide valuable implications for different stakeholders to guide the best-fit choice of a particular method as the solution under a specific circumstance.

"background modeling in the fourier domain for maritime infrared target detection","2020","The estimation of the sea background from maritime infrared video sequences is necessary for target detection. It is challenging to obtain an accurate background model when the scene is a complex and fluctuating sea surface. However, the amplitude spectrum sequences at each frequency point of the pure seawater frames in the Fourier domain are more stable than the gray value sequences of each pixel in the spatial domain. Thus, the background is modeled with a Gaussian distribution in the Fourier domain with the mean and variance adapted over time. In addition, the sea background dynamics are introduced by the variance of the amplitude spectrum sequence, and the dynamic Gaussian discriminant coefficient is set up for each frequency point. Two target discrimination flags are presented based on the background dynamics and Gaussian discriminant process to extract the target more accurately. Furthermore, the entropy filter in the Fourier domain is designed to enhance the target and suppress the sea clutter. The proposed method is successfully tested over several maritime infrared video sequences and has better detection effects compared with several existing state-of-the-art methods.","Fourier transforms,maritime infrared video sequences,entropy,fluctuating sea surface,Background model,sea background dynamics,seawater,sea clutter,spatial domain,dynamic Gaussian discriminant coefficient,target discrimination flags,Biological system modeling,background modeling,object detection,Entropy,Correlation,amplitude spectrum sequence,entropy filter,Adaptation models,image filtering,accurate background model,clutter,infrared imaging,image sequences,gray value sequences,complex sea surface,Gaussian discriminant process,Object detection,frequency point,Gaussian distribution,Heuristic algorithms,Fourier domain,pure seawater frames,maritime infrared target detection,"
"random finite set tracking for anomaly detection in the presence of clutter","2020","In this paper, a sequential Bayesian framework is proposed to address the task of joint anomaly detection and tracking for surveillance applications in the presence of clutter. This is achieved by modeling the anomaly as a switching unknown control input which goes into action by modifying the expected dynamics of a target and ceases its activity (becomes nonexistent) under nominal behavior. Random Finite Sets (RFS) make it possible to represent the switching nature of the object anomalous behavior and derive a hybrid Bernoulli filter (HBF) that sequentially updates the joint posterior density of a Bernoulli RFS for the unknown velocity input and the object kinematic state. In addition, the proposed HBF has been customized for maritime anomaly detection by using a piecewise Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) stochastic process as dynamic model of vessels.

"antenna beampattern matched optimum coherent detection in high-resolution mechanically scanning maritime surveillance radars","2023","Mechanically scanning radars are still widely used in ocean guard and surveillance areas nowadays, owing to simple structure, light weight and low cost. The antenna rotation causes amplitude modulation of target returns along pulses by the antenna azimuth beampattern. The traditional coherent detection that ignores this modulation suffers from some performance loss. In this article, an antenna beampattern matched optimum coherent detector and a dual-threshold detection scheme are proposed for high-resolution mechanically scanning maritime surveillance radars. First, it is shown that the modulation of target returns is determined by the antenna azimuth beampattern, scan rate, and pulse repetition interval and the antenna scanning also affect the temporal correlation of sea clutter. Second, the antenna beampattern matched optimum coherent detector is given in compound-Gaussian sea clutter with inverse Gamma distributed texture and the pulse scanning mode is used to deal with unknown target azimuth angle in the matched filter. Third, to mitigate the high computational cost of the pulse scanning mode, a dual-threshold scheme is given, which searches all pulse-range cells by short-time integration and further confirms suspected cells whose test statistics are between the two lower and higher thresholds in the search by long-time integration. Moreover, two fast recursive clutter covariance matrix inversion algorithms along pulses and range cells are presented, which bring a great reduction in computational complexity. Finally, real measured radar data is used to verify the proposed detector and scheme and the experimental results show that it behaves better in detection of small targets than the traditional detectors.","Antennas,covariance matrices,maritime surveillance radars,Radar antennas,mechanically scanning maritime surveillance radars,radar detection,radar clutter,high-resolution mechanically scanning maritime surveillance,compound-Gaussian sea clutter,sea clutter,amplitude modulation,target returns,dual-threshold detection scheme,matched filter,optimum coherent detector,scan rate,surveillance areas,ocean guard,gamma distribution,traditional coherent detection,dual-threshold scheme,Antenna beampattern matched optimum coherent detection,Gaussian processes,matrix inversion,search radar,measured radar data,unknown target,Radar,radar signal processing,antenna azimuth beampattern,antenna beampattern matched optimum coherent detection,high computational cost,azimuth beampattern modulation,Doppler radar,computational complexity,Clutter,scanning radars,fast recursive clutter covariance matrix inversion algorithms,pulse scanning mode,antenna rotation,Surveillance,pulse-range cells,antenna scanning,pulse repetition interval,Radar detection,"
"hybrid bernoulli filtering for detection and tracking of anomalous path deviations","2018","This paper presents a solution to the problem of sequential joint anomaly detection and tracking of a target subject to switching unknown path deviations. Based on a dynamic model described by Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) stochastic processes, the anomaly is represented by a target (e.g., a marine vessel) that deviates from a preset route by changing its nominal mean velocity. The Random Finite Set (RFS) framework is used to represent the switching nature of target's anomalous behavior in the presence of spurious measurements and detection uncertainty. Combining these two ingredients, the problem of jointly detecting target's path deviations and estimating its kinematic state can be formulated within the Bayesian framework, and analytically solved by means of a hybrid Bernoulli filter that sequentially updates the joint posterior density of the unknown OU velocity input (a Bernoulli RFS) and of the target's state random vector. We illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed filter, implemented in Gaussian-mixture form, in a simulated scenario of vessel tracking for maritime traffic monitoring.","Anomaly detection,switching nature,state random vector,Sea measurements,Stochastic processes,Radio frequency,vessel tracking,hybrid Bernoulli filtering,target tracking,Random Finite Set framework,stochastic processes,filtering theory,hybrid Bernoulli filter,Target tracking,object detection,Gaussian processes,Bayesian framework,Artificial intelligence,anomalous path deviations,unknown OU velocity input,nominal mean velocity,Surveillance,marine vessel,joint posterior density,sequential joint anomaly detection,"

Traditional detectors, such as the adaptive matched filter, which are designed for homogeneous data exhibit significant performance degradation due to the non-Gaussianity and inhomogeneity of the sea clutter returns. To tackle this problem, we make use of the multichannel coherent single data set algorithm which removes the need for any training data, thus alleviating the problem of clutter heterogeneity.

"self-adaption vessel traffic behaviour recognition algorithm based on multi-attribute trajectory characteristics","2020","Clustering analysis is commonly used for vessel traffic behaviour recognition. The clustering results reflect the characteristics of different vessel traffic behaviours, which can assist authorities in transportation management. However, there are two drawbacks to traditional clustering analysis. First, the similarity measures among different trajectories in a clustering analysis mainly focus on spatial differentiation and frequently do not consider motion features, such as speed and course. Second, the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm, a famous clustering analysis method, is characterized by poor self-adaption, which means that it cannot autonomously determine the best parameters based on different sample sets. These issues limit the efficiency of clustering analysis. To address these problems, a new similarity measure using statistical methods and based on multi-attribute trajectory characteristics is proposed to reflect the similarity among different trajectories. The proposed measure considers the spatial and motion features of trajectories. Furthermore, the Parzen window (a non-parametric estimation method) and the multivariate Gaussian distribution are employed to generate self-adaptive strategies to determine the optimal parameters of the DBSCAN algorithm for a given sample set. Finally, numerical experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed similarity measure and improved DBSCAN algorithm. The clustering analysis results obtained with the proposed method could provide insights towards better monitoring and navigation advice to help improve marine managerial effectiveness and avoid maritime accidents.","Vessel behaviour recognition,Self-adaption,Multi-attribute trajectory characteristics,DBSCAN,"

"synthetic trajectory extraction for maritime anomaly detection","2018","In the maritime domain, the main goal for large vessels is to drive as fast and efficiently as possible from one harbour to the next. This results in vessels following quite distinct routes. Deviations from these routes can be seen as indicators for illegal or at least suspicious behaviour. In order to extract these routes, clustering algorithms can be used, that will store the traffic patterns as synthetic trajectories. A vessel can be assigned to a specific route or a deviation from the routes can be detected by evaluating these route models. A challenge in designing the synthetic trajectories lies in the faithful representation, sparsity of data, treatment of outliers and split-up of routes. Here, a novel approach to model the uncertainty of the vessels movements while following a route is introduced: A cluster is now represented by a trajectory consisting of segments. Due to obstacles like shallow waters, a route might split up which will generate sub-segments. Instead of storing all cluster points, the position, speed, and course of the vessels are attached to each segment in form of normal distributions. Using these attributes, the probability of a deviation from the given trajectory can be estimated.","Clustering algorithms,Kernel,vessels movements,Anomaly detection,anomaly detection,traffic patterns,security of data,trajectory representation,ships,clustering algorithms,marine engineering,maritime domain,Heating systems,route models,pattern clustering,Artificial intelligence,maritime anomaly detection,synthetic trajectory extraction,Trajectory,data sparsity,probability,Gaussian distribution,data handling,"
"ais data-driven ship trajectory prediction modelling and analysis based on machine learning and deep learning methods","2023","Maritime transport faces new safety challenges in an increasingly complex traffic environment caused by large-scale and high-speed ships, particularly with the introduction of intelligent and autonomous ships. It is evident that Automatic Identification System (AIS) data-driven ship trajectory prediction can effectively aid in identifying abnormal ship behaviours and reducing maritime risks such as collision, stranding, and contact. Furthermore, trajectory prediction is widely recognised as one of the critical technologies for realising safe autonomous navigation. The prediction methods and their performance are the key factors for future safe and automatic shipping. Currently, ship trajectory prediction lacks the real performance measurement and analysis of different algorithms, including classical machine learning and emerging deep learning methods. This paper aims to systematically analyse the performance of ship trajectory prediction methods and pioneer experimental tests to reveal their advantages and disadvantages as well as fitness in different scenarios involving complicated systems. To do so, five machine learning methods (i.e., Kalman Filter (KF), Support Vector Progression (SVR), Back Propagation network (BP), Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), and Random Forest (RF)) and seven deep learning methods (i.e., Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gate Recurrent Unit (GRU), Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM), Sequence to Sequence (Seq2seq), Bi-directional Gate Recurrent Unit (Bi-GRU), and Transformer) are first extracted from the state-of-the-art literature review and then employed to implement the trajectory prediction and compare their prediction performance in the real world. Three AIS datasets are collected from the waters of representative traffic features, including a normal channel (i.e., the Chengshan Jiao Promontory), complex traffic (i.e., the Zhoushan Archipelago), and a port area (i.e., Caofeidian port). They are selected to test and analyse the performance of all twelve methods based on six evaluation indexes and explore the characteristics and effectiveness of the twelve trajectory prediction methods in detail. The experimental results provide a novel perspective, comparison, and benchmark for ship trajectory prediction research, which not only demonstrates the fitness of each method in different maritime traffic scenarios, but also makes significant contributions to maritime safety and autonomous shipping development.","Deep learning,Maritime safety,Trajectory prediction,AIS data,Machine learning,"

"bayesian filtering for dynamic anomaly detection and tracking","2022","This article presents a Bayesian approach for sequential detection of anomalies in the motion of a target and joint tracking. The anomaly is modeled as a binary (on/off) switching unknown control input that goes into action (begins to exist, or â€œswitches onâ€) thereby modifying the object dynamics; and by ceasing its activity (becoming nonexistent, or â€œswitching offâ€) returns the dynamics to nominal. The developed Bayesian framework brings together random finite set (RFS) theory to represent the switching nature of the anomaly, and optimal joint input and state estimation to sequentially update a hybrid state that incorporates a random vector for the kinematic state and a Bernoulli RFS for the unknown control input. In addition, a closed-form solution, the Gaussian-mixture hybrid Bernoulli filter (GM-HBF), has been developed to provide a customized solution for dynamic anomaly detection in the maritime domain characterized by linear Gaussian target dynamics. Based on the Ornsteinâ€“Uhlenbeck dynamic model for vessels, where the evolution of the object velocity is governed by a piecewise mean-reverting stochastic process, the anomaly can be represented by a change in the long-run mean velocity (i.e., the unknown control input) from the nominal condition that forces the vessel to deviate from its standard route. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed GM-HBF in both simulated and real-world maritime surveillance applications and test its performance in the face of false measurements, detection uncertainty, and sensor data gaps.","developed Bayesian framework,surveillance,kinematic state,Mathematical models,Anomaly detection,Automatic identification system (AIS),Bayesian approach,random finite sets (RFSs),Bayesian filtering,Bayes methods,object dynamics,linear Gaussian target dynamics,Switches,Bernoulli filter,switching unknown control input,Radio frequency,target tracking,Aerodynamics,stochastic processes,filtering theory,radar,state estimation,detection uncertainty,Gaussian processes,Bernoulli RFS,Radar tracking,maritime anomaly detection,dynamic anomaly detection,joint input and state estimation (JISE),probability,Ornstein-Uhlenbeck dynamic model,GM-HBF,Gaussian-mixture hybrid Bernoulli filter,"
