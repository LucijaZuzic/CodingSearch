"maritime anomaly detection in a real-world scenario: ever given grounding in the suez canal","2022","In this paper we present how automatic maritime anomaly detection tools can be successfully applied in real-world situations such as the major event of the container vessel Ever Given, which grounded in the Suez Canal on March 23rd 2021. The anomaly detector is designed to process the available sequence of Automatic Identification System (AIS) reports, information from ground-based or satellite radar systems if available, and contextual information defining the expected nominal behavior of navigation. A statistical hypothesis testing procedure is sequentially run to decide whether or not a deviation from the nominal behavior happened within a specific time period, for instance two consecutive data points. We show, based on the recorded AIS data from the Ever Given, that the proposed detector could have been triggered and alerted to anomalous behavior fully 19 minutes before the grounding.","anomaly detector,Anomaly detection,Marine vehicles,Grounding,statistical hypothesis testing,Ever Given grounding,automatic maritime anomaly detection tools,statistical analysis,Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process,Testing,ships,Containers,automatic identification system,radar,maritime surveillance,satellite radar systems,contextual information,container vessel,Suez Canal,Artificial intelligence,ground-based system,marine engineering computing,Maritime anomaly detection,Irrigation,statistical hypothesis testing procedure,expected nominal behavior,AIS data,"
"the lama system: a “smart” magnetometer network for harbour protection","2022","This work describes the development of an underwater anti-intrusion system based on a magnetometer self-informed network, whose purpose is to detect the presence of threats in the proximity of critical infrastructures (e.g, terrorist divers in harbours). In this context, the magnetic network fills the gaps of sonar systems at the critical boundaries of the water volume to be controlled (sea bed, docks, …), where acoustic performances deteriorate due to reflections and attenuations. The system operates in a port-protection scenario, characterized by a medium-high environmental magnetic noise that can hide the diver signal (a diver is a weak, quasi-point-like, moving source). The magnetometer network processes two inputs: the environmental magnetic noise and a signal including the target magnetic signal superimposed to the same noise; the frequencies of a diver signal lie within the noise band, hence frequency filtering proves inadequate for noise removal. The basic idea underlying the system is to measure and use the noise itself to filter the overall signal; measuring noise supports a background-subtraction process that allows to extract the target signal and therefore detect the threat presence. The effectiveness of the procedure depends on the positions of magnetometers: sensors must be close enough to one another to measure the common background noise, and, at the same time, should be distant enough from one another so that just one sensor can measure the target signal. To generate alarms when a threat is detected, a real-time software application processes data and activates a visual and acoustic alarm upon identification of a magnetic anomaly. Sea trials carried out in port areas provided extremely satisfactory results in the detection of intruders. The paper presents experimental results obtained during the method validation tests, when intruders were moving in the surrounding undersea environment.","Environmental magnetism,Marine geophysics,Time series analysis,Magnetic anomaly detection,Underwater magnetic systems,Harbour protection,"
"an integrated maritime reasoning and monitoring system","2012","Maritime information systems typically offer system features for data collection, information fusion and the automated construction of a basic recognized maritime picture for human operators. However making sense of maritime situations is still very much an intensive human-based cognitive endeavor. Limited human resources face difficult cognitive challenges in making sense of huge amount of data generated daily by dynamic round-the-clock maritime shipping and port activities. An effective information exploitation system for maritime surveillance and monitoring is expected to be able to augment human-based surveillance and monitoring operations with machine-based computing capabilities to interpret and reason about massive amount of situational information, as well as transforming this knowledge into actionable decision indicators for the human decision makers. The Defence Science & Technology Agency (DSTA) has developed the PACKED model to guide the exploration and development of computing technologies that support human decision making and other cognitive challenges in information rich, complex, and dynamic operational environments. An integrated maritime reasoning and monitoring system illustrates how computing technologies are applied in the areas of Attention, Knowledge, and Comprehension to support situation analysis and monitoring processes for maritime surveillance. The maritime reasoning and monitoring system consist of Bayesian reasoning, entity network analysis, and movement pattern analysis, to integrate, analyze, interpret and reason about maritime data. The Graylist Network Analysis (GNA) engine probes networks of entity-relationships to uncover â€œgraylistedâ€ entities that are closely associated with blacklisted entities. The Movement Pattern Analysis (MPA) engine uncovers common patterns in vessel movements and monitors real-time for maritime traffic data for anomalous vessel movements. The Bayesian network inference engine combines situation information from data sources and analysis results produced by analytical engines such as the GNA and MPA, with Bayesian knowledge models in order to infer probabilities of occurrences of maritime scenarios.","surveillance,naval engineering computing,sensor fusion,Maritime Monitoring System,attention-knowledge-and-comprehension,maritime traffic data,MPA engine,graylist network analysis,Bayes methods,Anomaly Detection,Monitoring,PACKED model,Bayesian reasoning,entity network analysis,decision indicator,information fusion,Bayesian knowledge model,Scenario Modeling,cognitive challenge,marine systems,military computing,data collection,Bayesian network inference engine,human-based cognitive endeavor,anomalous vessel movement,maritime surveillance,entity-relationship,Humans,GNA engine,Relationship Analysis,dynamic round-the-clock maritime shipping,maritime information system,information exploitation system,inference mechanisms,machine-based computing,port activity,Engines,Pattern analysis,Bayesian Reasoning,Trend Analysis,Algorithm design and analysis,Computational modeling,Cognition,maritime reasoning,maritime monitoring system,human-based surveillance,movement pattern analysis,"
"maritime situational awareness forensics tools for a common information sharing environment (cise)","2019","CISE stands for Common Information Sharing Environment and refers to an architecture and set of protocols, procedures and services for the exchange of data and information across Maritime Authorities of EU (European Union) Member States (MS's). In the context of enabling the implementation and adoption of CISE by different MS's, EU has funded a number of projects that enable the development of subsystems and adaptors intended to allow MS's to connect and make use of CISE. In this context, the Integrated Systems Laboratory (ISL) has led the development of the corresponding Hellenic and Cypriot CISE by developing a Control, Command & Information (C2I) system that unifies all partial maritime surveillance systems into one National Situational Picture Management (NSPM) system, and adaptors that allow the interconnection of the corresponding national legacy systems to CISE and the exchange of data, information and requests between the two MS's. Furthermore, a set of forensics tools that allow geospatial & time filtering and detection of anomalies, risk incidents, fake MMSIs, suspicious speed changes, collision paths, and gaps in AIS (Automatic Identification System), have been developed by combining motion models, AI, deep learning and fusion algorithms using data from different databases through CISE. This paper briefly discusses these developments within the EU CISE-2020, Hellenic CISE and CY-CISE projects and the benefits from the sharing of maritime data across CISE for both maritime surveillance and security. The prospect of using CISE for the creation of a considerably rich database that could be used for forensics analysis and detection of suspicious maritime traffic and maritime surveillance is discussed.","EU Member States,surveillance,maritime traffic,CY-CISE projects,Maritime Security,Distributed CISE database,Forensics,security of data,maritime security,common information sharing environment,National Situational Picture Management system,Cypriot CISE,MS,deep learning,automatic identification system,marine engineering,Maritime Surveillance,Databases,AIS,CISE,C2I system,Europe,Information management,corresponding national legacy systems,Control,Artificial intelligence,Hellenic CISE,NSPM system,command and control systems,Command,maritime surveillance systems,control-command-information system,national security,fusion algorithms,integrated systems laboratory,ISL,Surveillance,AI,Tools,learning (artificial intelligence),time filtering,forensics tools,"

"visual analytics for the detection of anomalous maritime behavior","2008","The surveillance of large sea areas often generates huge amounts of multidimensional data. Exploring, analyzing and finding anomalous behavior within this data is a complex task. Confident decisions upon the abnormality of a particular vessel behavior require a certain level of situation awareness that may be difficult to achieve when the operator is overloaded by the available information. Based on a visual analytics process model, we present a novel system that supports the acquisition of situation awareness and the involvement of the user in the anomaly detection process using two layers of interactive visualizations. The system uses an interactive data mining module that supports the insertion of the user's knowledge and experience in the creation, validation and continuous update of the normal model of the environment.","surveillance,visual analytics process model,data mining,vessel behavior,situation awareness,anomaly detection,visual analytics,data visualisation,interactive systems,security of data,interaction,interactive data mining module,large sea area,multidimensional data,marine engineering,engineering computing,interactive visualization,visualization,anomalous maritime traffic behavior detection,"

Human operators trying to establish individual or collective maritime situation awareness are often overloaded by this information. In order to help them cope with this information overload, we have developed a combined methodology of data visualization, interaction and mining techniques that allows filtering out anomalous vessels, by building a model over normal behavior from which the user can detect deviations. The methodology includes a set of interactive visual representations that support the insertion of the userpsilas knowledge and experience in the creation, validation and continuous update of the normal model.

"texture anomaly detection in radar imagery","1994","A radar image of the land or sea will contain extended regions of apparently homogeneous textures arising from, for example, forested areas or uniformly driven expanses of water. However, such regions may contain subtle texture anomalies which indicate the presence of a feature of interest such as a change in tree density due to environmental effects, damping of the sea surface due to the presence of pollutants or the presence of land-based or maritime military targets. For this reason, it is of interest to develop methods of detecting anomalies in textured regions. A strategy for texture anomaly detection is to estimate the multi-variate probability density function (PDF) of a texture segment using the whole homogeneous region as training data and then to calculate the likelihood of occurrence of each individual segment within the region given the PDF estimate. Those texture segments with anomalous likelihood values can then be flagged as potential texture anomalies.<>","Image texture analysis,radar imagery,PDF estimate,image texture,texture segment,Statistics,statistical analysis,texture anomaly detection,multi-variate probability density,Radar,radar image,texture segments,radar,"
"fast and parameter-light rare behavior detection in maritime trajectories","2020","Rare behaviors indicate important events and situations in maritime surveillance applications. State-of-the-art methods provide many effective solutions to detect anomalous behaviors. Meanwhile, most solutions are parameter-laden and too costly to identify useful rare behaviors with human knowledge in a visual analytics manner. This paper is concerned with a scheme cross trajectories, vessel attributes and the movement context for detecting rare behaviors through preprocessing, kNN-based clustering, and verification. Although the scheme involves several parameters, we demonstrate that they are able to be tackled in thresholds. As a result, a rare behavior factor is the single parameter that affect the detecting results. The proposed scheme is evaluated via a simulated data set for performance and a real life AIS data for effectiveness. Results show that high accuracy to labelled anomalies and useful rare behaviors can be achieved.","Rare behaviour detection,Trajectory,Visual analytics,"

It adopts a flexible and modular design and its preliminary prototype applies an SVM one-class classifier to detect anomalies.

"airborne maritime surveillance using magnetic anomaly detection signature","2020","For an airborne sensor, there is a pressing need to be able to detect/track submerged submarines, shipwrecks, sea mines, unexploded explosive ordnance, and buried drums during maritime surveillance. Traditional usage is the magnetic anomaly detection (MAD), where the small changes in the earth's magnetic field caused by the ferrous components of the targets are measured. The primary means of long-range detection and classification of targets are with passive and active acoustic sensors, and MAD is used for accurate final localization. MAD could also be used for land-based targets but this is not common. Knowing the relationship between the magnetic signature and the kinematic parameters, the tracking problem can be formulated under a Bayesian framework. In this article, multiple nonlinear filters are used for a real single surface-target tracking problem in maritime surveillance using an airborne total-field sensor. The posterior CramÃ©r-Rao lower bound for MAD is derived. Given the total-field measurements, these filters can estimate the kinematic states as well as the permanent moments and induced moments effectively. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed nonlinear filters as well as the impact of using MAD as part of airborne surveillance.","airborne radar,Kinematics,military radar,posterior Cramer-Rao lower bound,marine radar,underwater target tracking,single surface-target tracking problem,radar detection,active acoustic sensors,multiple nonlinear filters,long-range detection,Sea measurements,underwater vehicles,Magnetoacoustic effects,Airborne target tracking,target tracking,Magnetometers,land-based targets,magnetic anomaly detection signature,MAD,maritime surveillance,Target tracking,unexploded explosive ordnance,total-field measurements,airborne total-field sensor,nonlinear target tracking,magnetic anomaly detection,nonlinear filters,Magnetic moments,radar tracking,accurate final localization,buried drums,sea mines,ferrous components,airborne maritime surveillance,Earth,Surveillance,airborne sensor,passive sensors,magnetic signature,"

"mining vessel tracking data for maritime domain applications","2016","The growing number of remote sensing systems and ship reporting technologies (e.g. Automatic Identification System, Long Range Identification and Tracking, radar tracking, Earth Observation) are generating an overwhelming amount of spatio-temporal and geographically distributed data related to vessels and their movements. Research on reliable data mining techniques has proven essential to the discovery of knowledge from such increasingly available information on ship traffic at sea. Data driven knowledge discovery has very recently demonstrated its value in fields that go beyond the original maritime safety and security remits of such data. They include, but are not limited to, fisheries management, maritime spatial planning, gridding ship emissions, mapping activities at sea, risk assessment of offshore platforms, and trade indicators. The extraction of useful information from maritime Big Data is thus a key element in providing operational authorities, policy-makers and scientists with supporting tools to understand what is happening at sea and improve maritime knowledge. This work will provide a survey of the recent JRC research activities relevant to automatic anomaly detection and knowledge discovery in the maritime domain.

"improving sar wind retrieval through automatic anomalous pixel detection","2023","Satellite observations are increasingly in demand and valuable for monitoring the ocean and coastal winds in near-real-time and analyzing the data historically. However, soared up human activities, man-made constructions, and marine traffics negatively interfere and affect the reliability of observations and raise concerns about the trustworthiness of using satellite winds for many applications, such as offshore wind energy, even though Sentinel synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data is freely and easily accessible. In this paper, we presented a novel methodological framework for localization and suppression of anomalous pixels (APs), which deteriorate the confidence and accuracy of the retrieved SAR wind speeds. The backbone of the implementation relied on the constant false alarm rate (CFAR) algorithm, one of the automatic target recognition algorithms. We used a large dataset of SAR subscenes to model different sea clutter conditions after removing the potential targets. We selected the suitable distribution model that maintains a constant probability of false alarm (pfa) for the entire SAR scene. The proper pfa was optimized in various SAR scenes ranging from scenes with a considerable number of APs, such as ships and wind park clusters, to scenes with no visible APs under different wind speed conditions. The pfa optimization process prevented real wind pixels from being misidentified as APs. Applying CFAR to the logarithmic scale of raw digital numbers (log-DNs) domain with a pfa of about 3.17 × 10-5, we extracted SAR wind speeds around each ocean buoy before and after CFAR process, comparing them with their corresponding in situ wind measurements. This led to significant improvement in the quality and accuracy of SAR wind data retrieval, especially in regions with numerous man-made constructions and high marine traffics. We tested and validated our approach in the North Sea and two regions along the eastern coast of the U.S. The enclosed region, serving as a marine route for harbors in Delaware Bay, showed a substantial improvement in RMSE and BIAS after applying our approach, reducing RMSE from 2.4 m/s to 1.6 m/s and the BIAS from −1.5 m/s to −0.3 m/s. The open ocean region demonstrated stable RMSE and BIAS, indicating preservation of real wind data, as only APs affecting SAR wind speed were considered during the process.","Offshore wind farm,SAR,Sentinel-1,CFAR,Anomalous pixel,Coastal environment,"
"augmented ship tracking under occlusion conditions from maritime surveillance videos","2020","Ship tracking provides crucial on-site microscopic kinematic traffic information which benefits maritime traffic flow analysis, ship safety enhancement, traffic control, etc., and thus has attracted considerable research attentions in the maritime surveillance community. Conventional ship tracking methods yield satisfied results by exploring distinct visual ship features in maritime images, which may fail when the target ship is partially or fully sheltered by obstacles (e.g., ships, waves, etc.) in maritime videos. To overcome the difficulty, we propose an augmented ship tracking framework via the kernelized correlation filter (KCF) and curve fitting algorithm. First, the KCF model is introduced to track ships in the consecutive maritime images and obtain raw ship trajectory dataset. Second, the data anomaly detection and rectification procedure are implemented to rectify the contaminated ship positions. For the purpose of performance evaluation, we implement the proposed framework and another three popular ship tracking models on the four typical ship occlusion videos. The experimental results show that our proposed framework successfully tracks ships in maritime video clips with high accuracy (i.e., the average root mean square error (RMSE), root mean square percentage error (RMSPE), mean absolute deviation (MAD) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) are less than 10), which significantly outperforms the other popular ship trackers.","Smart ship,maritime surveillance videos,Marine vehicles,Feature extraction,maritime traffic flow analysis,augmented ship tracking,ship trajectory dataset,on-site microscopic kinematic traffic information,visual ship features,Videos,kernelized correlation filter,object tracking,ships,marine safety,marine engineering,Target tracking,object detection,feature extraction,maritime images,Correlation,curve fitting algorithm,image filtering,video signal processing,Training,curve fitting,ship occlusion videos,data anomaly detection,Visualization,traffic control,ship occlusion,traffic engineering computing,ship safety enhancement,video surveillance,visual ship tracking,"

"framework for ship trajectory forecasting based on linear stationary models using automatic identification system","2022","Maritime surveillance is of utmost priority for a nation's security, and hence it's economy. For maritime awareness, coastal surveillance, and maritime activities in the Region of Interest (ROI) should be monitored. One of the ways to keep this in check is to restrain unwanted infiltration. Monitoring unwanted infiltration is feasible through vessel trajectory forecasting and anomaly detection in real time. Most solutions for trajectory predictions are available but require a huge amount of historical data, and high-power computing resources. Here, the requirement is developing a decision support framework consisting of both lite weight approaches for short-term predictions and deep learning-based techniques for long-term forecasting. This paper aims to find the suitability of Linear Stationary Models (LSM) like the Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average Model (ARIMA) for predicting and forecasting the Vessel Trajectory as means of lite weight short-term predictions. For this purpose, the Automatic Identification System (AIS) dataset of the U.S. West Coast is used. The significant effort was for data pre-processing to create a robust dataset for model training. An appropriate model after the model-selection process is used for trajectory forecasting. The model's accuracy is validated using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) performance indices for residual and forecast errors. A window generator model is integrated with the best-fitted ARIMA model for recursive real-time predictions, with varied sizes and visualization. The proposed time-series model provided a very high accuracy as the RMSE value for prediction and 48 hours forecast are 0.023 and 0.017, respectively.","Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average Model,Window Generator,Trajectory Forecast,Time Series Analysis,Automatic Identification System,Maritime Surveillance,"

"interactive visualization of normal behavioral models and expert rules for maritime anomaly detection","2009","Maritime surveillance systems analyze vast amounts of heterogeneous sensor data from a large number of objects. In order to support the operator while monitoring such systems, the identification of anomalous vessels or situations that might need further investigation may reduce the operator's cognitive load. While it is worth acknowledging that many existing mining applications support identification of anomalous behavior, autonomous anomaly detection systems are rarely used in the real world, since the detection of anomalous behavior is normally not a well-defined problem and therefore, human expert knowledge is needed. This calls for the development of interaction components that can support the user in the detection process. In order to support the comprehension of the knowledge embedded in the system, we propose an interactive way of visualizing expert rules and normal behavioral models built from the data. The overall goal is to facilitate the validation and update of these models and signatures, supporting the insertion of human expert knowledge while improving confidence and trust in the system.","embedded systems,surveillance,data mining,human expert knowledge system,National security,anomaly detection,visual analytics,Sensor systems,Monitoring,normal behavioral models,data visualisation,security of data,data analysis,Computer graphics,marine engineering,Humans,autonomous anomaly detection systems,heterogeneous sensor data,Data visualization,expert systems,maritime surveillance systems,interactive visualization,association rules mining,maritime situation awareness,rules/signatures,Object detection,Surveillance,Data mining,AIS data,Data security,embedded system,"

"maritime vessel route extraction and automatic information system (ais) spoofing detection","2021","Automated Identification System (AIS) comprises of a global real-time network of maritime vessels, transmitters, and satellite or ground-station receivers, which are used to track and record time-stamped static (vessel-id, type, etc.) and dynamic (location, course, speed, etc.) information of all maritime vessels. Traditionally, this data feed has been used by vessel traffic services to avoid vessel collisions, however increasingly, marine researchers and data scientists have shown interest in developing algorithms on historical AIS data-dumps with diverse objectives such as estimating trends in global ocean-currents, maritime logistical planning, fishing fleet monitoring and enhancing maritime security. This paper aims to propose a novel shipping-route extraction algorithm to process historical AIS data (running into tens of gigabytes of daily data, from more than a hundred thousand maritime vessels), to effectively characterize global shipping route behaviour and capture its seasonal trends. This is done by formulating a sigmoid based turning waypoint identification, which does not solely depend on the change in the course of a vessel, derived from AIS message. The AIS data is further processed to excerpt the vesselâ€™s distance from the nearest port and nearest shore with resolution of about 1 km, which forms a handy metric for the identification of suspicious ports. Several other use cases are also explored, which include detecting various anomalies in individual vessel behaviour such as intentional or unintentional switching off AIS transmission, shipping-lane deviations, spoofing transmission messages. To tackle spoofing anomaly, various spoofing identification methods are discussed. A region-based spoofing identification algorithm is developed to identify spoofing points under multiple categories using a clustering algorithm. All the results are visualized through an open-source map overlay.

"exploring trajectory behavior model for anomaly detection in maritime moving objects","2013","As security requirements in coastal water and sea ports, maritime surveillance increases the duty. In this research, we focus on the maritime trajectory data to explore movement behavior for anomaly detection in maritime traffic. Trajectory data records the moving objects' true movement and provides the opportunity to discover the movement behavior for anomaly detection. The multidimensional outlying features are first identified and defined.

"detecting anomalies from a multitarget tracking output","2014","Surveillance systems typically incorporate multitarget tracking algorithms for sequential estimation of kinematic states (e.g. positions, velocities) of moving objects in the surveillance domain of interest. This letter proposes an algorithm for online detection of anomalies in the motion and the count of objects, using the output of a multiobject tracking algorithm. The surveillance area is partitioned by a square grid and the kinematic states that fall inside each cell of the grid are modelled by a Poisson point process. During the unsupervised learning phase, the parameters of the Poisson point process are estimated for each cell. The testing phase is performed sequentially by threshold detection at a specified level of significance. The performance of the algorithm is illustrated using the Automatic Identification System (AIS) dataset in the context of maritime surveillance.","Kinematics,Kernel,multiobject tracking algorithm,Vectors,Poisson point process,sequential estimation,target tracking,unsupervised learning phase,multitarget tracking algorithms,Testing,object tracking,automatic identification system dataset,maritime surveillance,Partitioning algorithms,Tracking,online anomaly detection,Surveillance,kinematic states,video surveillance,"
"maritime vessel traffic modeling in the context of concept drift","2017","Maritime traffic modeling serves the purpose of extracting human-readable information and discovering knowledge in the otherwise illegible mass of traffic data. The goal of this study is to examine the presence and character of fluctuations in maritime traffic patterns. The main objective is to identify such fluctuations and capture them in terms of a concept drift, i.e., unforeseen shifts in statistical properties of the modeled target occurring over time. The empirical study is based on a collection of AIS vessel tracking data, spanning over a year. The scope of the study limits the AIS data area to the Baltic region (9-31°E, 53-66°N), which experiences some of the most dense maritime traffic in the world. The investigations employ a novel maritime traffic modeling method based on the potential fields concept, adapted for this study to facilitate the examination of concept drift. The concept drift is made apparent in course of the statistical and visual analysis of the experimental results. This study shows a number of particular cases, in which the maritime traffic is affected by concept drifts of varying extent and character. The visual representations of the traffic models make shifts in the traffic patterns apparent and comprehensible to human eye. Based on the experimental outcomes, the robustness of the modeling method against concept drift in traffic is discussed and improvements are proposed. The outcomes provide insights into regularly reoccurring drifts and irregularities within the traffic data itself that may serve to further optimize the modeling method, and – in turn – the performance of detection based on it.","maritime traffic,concept drift,traffic modeling,anomaly detection,"

This paper proposes a data-driven approach to anomaly detection, highlighting challenges specific to the maritime domain. This work builds on unsupervised learning techniques which provide models for normal traffic behaviour. A methodology to associate tracks to the derived traffic model is then presented. This is done by the pre-extraction of contextual information as the baseline patterns of life (i.e., routes) in the area under investigation. In addition to a brief description of the approach to derive the routes, their characterization and representation is presented in support of exploitable knowledge to classify anomalies. A hierarchical reasoning is proposed where new tracks are first associated to existing routes based on their positional information only and â€œoff-routeâ€ vesselsâ€ are detected. Then, for on-route vessels further anomalies are detected such as â€œspeed anomalyâ€ or â€œheading anomalyâ€.

"detection and geovisualization of abnormal vessel behavior from video","2021","Intelligent maritime situational awareness pursues an effective understanding of the majority of the activities related to the maritime domain (impacting the safety, security, economy, or environment), with the aid of artificial intelligence systems. Such an understanding requires the development of automated processes capable of not only detecting abnormal behavior but also of visually-representing and interpreting it. Although much progress has been made in anomaly detection and visualization using vessel self-reporting positioning data, there have been no corresponding advances using video data, despite the increasing use of cameras for maritime surveillance. In this work, we introduce a framework which goes beyond vessel tracking for anomaly detection in video, and is therefore applicable to scenes with a high density of vessels. The proposed framework detects abnormal behavior using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and interprets this knowledge using metrics derived from clustering the positions and courses provided by an independent vessel/motion detector. These detections are geovisualized using an advanced displaying tool where detected abnormal behavior may be localized on the globe, providing an infrastructure for intelligent maritime situational awareness.","generative adversarial network,surveillance,Safety,anomaly detection,Generative adversarial networks,data visualisation,Knowledge engineering,security of data,geovisualization,intelligent maritime situational awareness,marine engineering,abnormal vessel behavior,maritime surveillance,vessel self-reporting positioning data,object detection,maritime domain,Measurement,Real-time systems,video signal processing,artificial intelligence systems,Tools,artificial intelligence,Detectors,"

"permeability and voids influence on the thermal signal, as inferred by multitemporal uav-based infrared and visible images","2020","This work presents for the first time associated thermal anomalies and deformations over subsurface cavities/voids located within two harbour quays in Le Havre Harbourg, Normandy, France. An U.A.V. (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) was used to acquire visible and thermal images over a diurnal cycle (from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m.). The visible images were processed to realize an altimetric model of the platforms by mean of the photogrammetric method, while the thermal infrared (TIR) images were used to study the evolution of their surface temperatures. The obtained 3D model shows the location of five topographic depressions on both quays. The analysis of the evolution of the surface thermal field leads to the detection of cold thermal anomalies that are (1) not correlated to surface properties, and (2) spatially associated to the flanks of the five topographic depressions. Using a 2D conductive-radiative model, we show that these anomalies are not directly due to the thermally insulating effect of an air-filled area. Finally, we conclude that preferential infiltration and subsequent evaporation in the micro-fracturation present within the flanks of the depressions may be responsible for the strong cooling of these zones.","Thermal infrared,Photogrammetry,Remote Sensing,infiltration,Subsurface cavity,Natural hazards,UAV,"
"image-consistent detection of road anomalies as unpredictable patches","2023","We propose a novel method for anomaly detection primarily aiming at autonomous driving. The design of the method, called DaCUP (Detection of anomalies as Consistent Unpredictable Patches), is based on two general properties of anomalous objects: an anomaly is (i) not from a class that could be modelled and (ii) it is not similar (in appearance) to non-anomalous objects in the image. To this end, we propose a novel embedding bottleneck in an auto-encoder like architecture that enables modelling of a diverse, multi-modal known class appearance (e.g. road). Secondly, we introduce novel image-conditioned distance features that allow known class identification in a nearest-neighbour manner on-the-fly, greatly increasing its ability to distinguish true and false positives. Lastly, an inpainting module is utilized to model the uniqueness of detected anomalies and significantly reduce false positives by filtering regions that are similar, thus reconstructable from their neighbourhood. We demonstrate that filtering of regions based on their similarity to neighbour regions, using e.g. an inpainting module, is general and can be used with other methods for reduction of false positives. The proposed method is evaluated on several publicly available datasets for road anomaly detection and on a maritime benchmark for obstacle avoidance. The method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both tasks with the same hyper-parameters with no domain specific design.","Benchmark testing,anomalous objects,road anomaly detection,Feature extraction,detection of anomalies as consistent unpredictable patches,Design methodology,Filtering,nearest-neighbour manner,nonanomalous objects,object detection,feature extraction,multimodal known class appearance,inpainting module,autonomous driving,domain specific design,nearest neighbour methods,Roads,image-consistent detection,mobile robots,image restoration,DaCUP,Task analysis,auto-encoder,Algorithms: Image recognition and understanding (object detection,obstacle avoidance,Computer vision,road vehicles,categorization,image-conditioned distance features,class identification,segmentation),"

"bayesian filtering for dynamic anomaly detection and tracking","2022","This article presents a Bayesian approach for sequential detection of anomalies in the motion of a target and joint tracking. The anomaly is modeled as a binary (on/off) switching unknown control input that goes into action (begins to exist, or â€œswitches onâ€) thereby modifying the object dynamics; and by ceasing its activity (becoming nonexistent, or â€œswitching offâ€) returns the dynamics to nominal. The developed Bayesian framework brings together random finite set (RFS) theory to represent the switching nature of the anomaly, and optimal joint input and state estimation to sequentially update a hybrid state that incorporates a random vector for the kinematic state and a Bernoulli RFS for the unknown control input. In addition, a closed-form solution, the Gaussian-mixture hybrid Bernoulli filter (GM-HBF), has been developed to provide a customized solution for dynamic anomaly detection in the maritime domain characterized by linear Gaussian target dynamics. Based on the Ornsteinâ€“Uhlenbeck dynamic model for vessels, where the evolution of the object velocity is governed by a piecewise mean-reverting stochastic process, the anomaly can be represented by a change in the long-run mean velocity (i.e., the unknown control input) from the nominal condition that forces the vessel to deviate from its standard route. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed GM-HBF in both simulated and real-world maritime surveillance applications and test its performance in the face of false measurements, detection uncertainty, and sensor data gaps.","developed Bayesian framework,surveillance,kinematic state,Mathematical models,Anomaly detection,Automatic identification system (AIS),Bayesian approach,random finite sets (RFSs),Bayesian filtering,Bayes methods,object dynamics,linear Gaussian target dynamics,Switches,Bernoulli filter,switching unknown control input,Radio frequency,target tracking,Aerodynamics,stochastic processes,filtering theory,radar,state estimation,detection uncertainty,Gaussian processes,Bernoulli RFS,Radar tracking,maritime anomaly detection,dynamic anomaly detection,joint input and state estimation (JISE),probability,Ornstein-Uhlenbeck dynamic model,GM-HBF,Gaussian-mixture hybrid Bernoulli filter,"

"belief modeling for maritime surveillance","2009","In maritime surveillance, the volume of information to be processed is very large and there is a great deal of uncertainty about the data. There are many vessels at sea at every point in time, and the vast majority of them pose no threat to security. Sifting through all of the benign activity to find unusual activities is a difficult problem. The problem is made even more difficult by the fact that the available data about vessel activities is both incomplete and inconsistent. In order to manage this uncertainty, automated anomaly detection software can be very useful in the early detection of threats to security. This paper introduces a high-level architecture for an anomaly detection system based on a formal model of beliefs with respect to each entity in some domain of interest. In this framework, the system has beliefs about the intentions of each vessel in the maritime domain. If the vessel behaves in an unexpected manner, these intentions are revised and a human operations centre worker is notified. This approach is flexible, scalable, and easily manages inconsistent information. Moreover, the approach has the pragmatic advantage that it uses expert information to inform decision making, but the required information is easily obtained through simple ranking exercises.","surveillance,Anomaly detection,automated anomaly detection software,Marine vehicles,Monitoring,security of data,Decision making,Information security,data uncertainty,belief modeling,Application software,marine engineering,maritime surveillance,Humans,Radar tracking,decision making,high-level architecture,belief revision,Uncertainty,Surveillance,Data security,"
"context-enhanced vessel prediction based on ornstein-uhlenbeck processes using historical ais traffic patterns: real-world experimental results","2014","Traffic route analysis and prediction are both essential for maritime security. Specifically, the prediction of a vessel position is useful to provide alerts about upcoming events (e.g., opportunities and threats). However, accurate prediction along a route in the maritime domain is a challenging task, due to the complex and dynamic nature of traffic patterns. This paper presents a vessel prediction method, based on the popular Ornstein-Uhlenbeck stochastic processes, whose parameters are estimated from historical patterns of life. The historical traffic routes are obtained by pre-processing Automatic Identification System (AIS) data via the CMRE tool called Traffic Route Extraction for Anomaly Detection (TREAD). These recurrent routes allow prediction of the position of a vessel that is following one of these routes, surprisingly, by several hours.

The highlights of the campaigns include improved prediction of equatorial spread-F (ESF) based on a ‘new factor’ combining the strength and asymmetry of the equatorial ionization anomaly (EIA); simultaneous detection of quasi-2-day wave at both E and F region heights; tomographic image showing a Traveling Ionospheric Disturbance (TID) in association with a counter electrojet (CEJ) event—all highlighting the neutral and electrodynamical coupling of the equatorial ionosphere−thermosphere regions; an unusual lowering of mesospheric temperature during a moderate geomagnetic storm—highlighting a new space weather effect; diurnal tide showing a peak amplitude of 35m/s at 45km in zonal wind and a significantly lower amplitude (∼15m/s) in the meridional wind and also evidence of convective activity in the lower atmosphere influencing the tidal variability in the Mesosphere−Lower Thermosphere (MLT) region highlighting the vertical coupling of the atmospheric regions.

In addition, we exploit GAD to rectify the training data of CDBN, such that the prediction on BV assignments can be more accurate to achieve a higher capacity than known methods.

Random Finite Sets (RFS) make it possible to represent the switching nature of the object anomalous behavior and derive a hybrid Bernoulli filter (HBF) that sequentially updates the joint posterior density of a Bernoulli RFS for the unknown velocity input and the object kinematic state. In addition, the proposed HBF has been customized for maritime anomaly detection by using a piecewise Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) stochastic process as dynamic model of vessels.

"development of a time series imaging approach for fault classification of marine systems","2022","As part of any Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) system for the shipping industry, the determination of the current health of marine systems is fundamental. As such, diagnostic analytics is performed; a process that is typically constituted by fault detection, fault isolation, and fault identification. Although some efforts have been made to distinguish the faults and malfunctions (fault detection) that can occur in marine systems, the implementation of fault identification to provide a description of any considered fault type and its nature is still an unexplored area due to the lack of fault data. To overcome this, a methodology for the identification of anomalies in marine systems is presented in this paper. The proposed approach aims to analyse the implementation of time series imaging through the application of the first-order Markov chain in tandem with an analysis of both ResNet50V2 and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) as part of the image classification task. To highlight the performance of this methodology, anomalies have been simulated considering the power parameter of a diesel generator.

"anomaly based sea-surface small target detection using k-nearest neighbor classification","2020","Sea-surface small target detection is always a difficult problem in high-resolution maritime ubiquitous radars for complex characteristics of sea clutter, weak target returns, and diversity of targets. Multiple features extracted from radar returns in different domains have ability but not enough to solely distinguish radar returns with target from sea clutter. Joint exploitation of multiple features becomes the key to improve detection performance. In this article, the K-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm and anomaly detection idea are cooperated to develop a novel sea-surface target detection method in the feature space spanned by the eight existing salient features. The detection is realized by the anomaly detection followed by a specially designed KNN-based classifier with a controllable false alarm rate. In the anomaly detection, a decision region is determined by the hyper-spherical coverage of the training set of sea clutter that is sufficient and ergodic in the feature space. The KNN-based classifier is designed based on the training sample set of sea clutter and the training sample set of simulated target returns plus sea clutter that is sufficient but nonergodic, by joint usage of feature weighting, neighbor weighting, and distance weighting. The novel method is validated by the two open and recognized IPIX and CSIR radar databases for sea-surface small target detection. The results show that it provides significant performance improvement in comparison with the existing multiple-feature-based detection methods, owing to the fact that the novel method avoids the dimension restriction and feature compression loss in the existing methods.","k-nearest neighbor algorithm,feature compression loss,IPIX radar databases,marine radar,high-resolution maritime ubiquitous radars,Anomaly detection,radar detection,radar clutter,KNN-based classifier design,anomaly based sea-surface,neighbor algorithm,Feature extraction,sea clutter,radar computing,anomaly detection idea,object detection,feature extraction,CSIR radar databases,weak target return simulation,K-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier with controllable false alarm rate,Radar clutter,feature weighting space,nearest neighbour methods,Training,sea-surface small target detection,Clutter,sea-surface target detection method,Object detection,Anomaly detection framework,multiple-feature-based detection methods,training sample set,Radar detection,"

"interval prediction of vessel trajectory based on lower and upper bound estimation and attention-modified lstm with bayesian optimization","2023","Uncertainty prediction of vessel trajectory is essential to enhance maritime situational awareness and traffic safety. Traditional approaches for trajectory prediction face challenges in accurately quantifying uncertainties, thereby limiting effectiveness in decision-making. To address this challenge, we propose a hybrid interval prediction frame of vessel trajectory using the lower and upper bound estimation (LUBE) and attention-modified long short-term memory (LSTM) network with bayesian optimization (BO). Firstly, trajectory data is preprocessed to solve the scale irregularity. Then, a novel trajectory interval prediction model for perceiving the prediction uncertainties is designed based on an advanced attention-modified LSTM with interval prediction capability. Meanwhile, a supervised training strategy with differentiating the interval widths of latitude and longitude is put forward to devise sample labels for training the model. Additionally, a new prediction interval-based objective function is proposed considering the target of maximizing coverage and minimizing width of trajectory interval. The BO algorithm optimizes the weighted parameters in the LSTM network by minimizing the objective function value. Finally, cases from two water areas are implemented to test and verify the proposed method. The results illustrate the superiority of the proposed approach in (1) outperforming other methods used for comparison in both coverage probability and width criteria of prediction interval. (2) quantifying the prediction uncertainty and improving the reliability of trajectory predictor. (3) performing anomaly detection tasks using visualized trajectory prediction intervals. The research can help maritime traffic participants obtain more reliable trajectory data, which supports making more reasonable traffic supervision decisions.","Long short-term memory,Attention mechanism,Vessel trajectory,Lower and upper bound estimation (LUBE),Interval prediction,"
"grid size optimization for potential field based maritime anomaly detection","2014","This study focuses on improving the potential field based maritime data modeling method, developed to extract traffic patterns and detect anomalies, in a clear, understandable and informative way. The method's novelty lies in employing the concept of a potential field for AIS vessel tracking data abstraction and maritime traffic representation. Unlike the traditional maritime surveillance equipment, such as radar or GPS, the AIS system comprehensively represents the identity and properties of a vessel, as well as its behavior, thus preserving the effects of navigational decisions, based on the skills of experienced seamen. In the developed data modeling process, every vessel generates potential charges, which value represent the vessel's behavior, and drops the charges at locations it passes. Each AIS report is used to assign a potential charge at the reported vessel positions. The method derives three construction elements, which define, firstly, how charges are accumulated, secondly, how a charge decays over time, and thirdly, in what way the potential is distributed around the source charge. The collection of potential fields represents a model of normal behavior, and vessels not conforming to it are marked as anomalous. In the anomaly detection prototype system STRAND, the sensitivity of anomaly detection can be modified by setting a geographical coordinate grid precision to more dense or coarse. The objective of this study is to identify the optimal grid size for two different conditions – an open sea and a port area case. A noticeable shift can be observed between the results for the open sea and the port area. The plotted detection rates converge towards an optimal ratio for smaller grid sizes in the port area (60-200 meters), than in the open sea case (300-1000 meters). The effective outcome of the potential filed based anomaly detection is filtering out all vessels behaving normally and presenting a set of anomalies, for a subsequent incident analysis using STRAND as an information visualization tool.","maritime traffic,potential field,anomaly detection,AIS,"

"detecting anomalous deviations from standard maritime routes using the ornsteinâ€“uhlenbeck process","2018","A novel anomaly detection procedure based on the Ornsteinâ€“Uhlenbeck (OU) mean-reverting stochastic process is presented. The considered anomaly is a vessel that deviates from a planned route, changing its nominal velocity $\boldsymbol{v}_0$. In order to hide this behavior, the vessel switches off its automatic identification system (AIS) device for a time  $T$ and then tries to revert to the previous nominal velocity $\boldsymbol{v}_0$. The decision that has to be made is declaring that a deviation either happened or not, relying only upon two consecutive AIS contacts. Furthermore, the extension to the scenario in which multiple contacts (e.g., radar) are available during the time period $T$ is also considered. A proper statistical hypothesis testing procedure that builds on the changes in the OU process long-term velocity parameter $\boldsymbol{v}_0$ of the vessel is the core of the proposed approach and enables the solution of the anomaly detection problem.

"manifold learning techniques for unsupervised anomaly detection","2018","Appropriately identifying outlier data is a critical requirement in the decision-making process of many expert and intelligent systems deployed in a variety of fields including finance, medicine, and defense. Classical outlier detection schemes typically rely on the assumption that normal/background data of interest are distributed according to an assumed statistical model and search for data that deviate from that assumption. However, it is frequently the case that performance is reduced because the underlying distribution does not follow the assumed model. Manifold learning techniques offer improved performance by learning better models of the background but can be too computationally expensive due to the need to calculate a distance measure between all data points. Here, we study a general framework that allows manifold learning techniques to be used for unsupervised anomaly detection by reducing computational expense via a uniform random sampling of a small fraction of the data. A background manifold is learned from the sample and then an out-of-sample extension is used to project unsampled data into the learned manifold space and construct an anomaly detection statistic based on the prediction error of the learned manifold. The method works well for unsupervised anomaly detection because, by definition, the ratio of anomalous to non-anomalous data points is small and the sampling will be dominated by background points. However, a variety of parameters that affect detection performance are introduced so we use here a low-dimensional toy problem to investigate their effect on the performance of four learning algorithms (kernel PCA, two versions of diffusion map, and the Parzen density estimator). We then apply the methods to the detection of watercraft in an ensemble of 22 infrared maritime scenes where we find kernel PCA to be superior and show that it outperforms a commonly employed baseline algorithm. The framework is not limited to the tested image processing example and can be used for any unsupervised anomaly detection task.","Manifolds,Anomaly detection,Image processing,Manifold learning,Target detection,"
