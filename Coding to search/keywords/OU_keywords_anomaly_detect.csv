"a novel quality control method of time-series ocean wave observation data combining deep-learning prediction and statistical analysis","2023","Quality control (QC) of marine data is a critical aspect in ensuring the usability of oceanic data. In this paper, we propose a novel QC method for time-series ocean wave data, which combines deep learning prediction and statistical analysis. Our method first realizes multi-element LSTM prediction of the time-series ocean wave observation data, capturing both temporal consistency and physical relationships between the multi-element inputs. Then, it applies peak detection on the regional mean difference ratio derived from the predicted and true values of the ocean wave data, and finally labels the anomalous data points based on peak detection results. We conducted experiments on the time-series wave data of four sites from the National Marine Science Center, China, and compared our proposed method with traditional QC method that is currently used for operational marine data quality control, as well as classic anomaly detection models including Isolation Forest and VAE-LSTM. The results show a significant improvement in the Precision, Recall, and F1 Score for erroneous samples using our proposed method. Our proposed method takes advantages of both deep learning and statistical analysis and considers physical correlation of multiple elements of marine data, effectively addressing the problem of erroneous discrimination of abnormal sea conditions in the traditional method, and providing valuable insights for the study of marine time-series observational data.","Deep-learning prediction,Time-series data,Statistical analysis,Quality control,"
"maritime anomaly detection in a real-world scenario: ever given grounding in the suez canal","2022","In this paper we present how automatic maritime anomaly detection tools can be successfully applied in real-world situations such as the major event of the container vessel Ever Given, which grounded in the Suez Canal on March 23rd 2021. The anomaly detector is designed to process the available sequence of Automatic Identification System (AIS) reports, information from ground-based or satellite radar systems if available, and contextual information defining the expected nominal behavior of navigation. A statistical hypothesis testing procedure is sequentially run to decide whether or not a deviation from the nominal behavior happened within a specific time period, for instance two consecutive data points. We show, based on the recorded AIS data from the Ever Given, that the proposed detector could have been triggered and alerted to anomalous behavior fully 19 minutes before the grounding.","anomaly detector,Anomaly detection,Marine vehicles,Grounding,statistical hypothesis testing,Ever Given grounding,automatic maritime anomaly detection tools,statistical analysis,Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process,Testing,ships,Containers,automatic identification system,radar,maritime surveillance,satellite radar systems,contextual information,container vessel,Suez Canal,Artificial intelligence,ground-based system,marine engineering computing,Maritime anomaly detection,Irrigation,statistical hypothesis testing procedure,expected nominal behavior,AIS data,"
"discovering themes and trends in transportation research using topic modeling","2017","Transportation research is a key area in both science and engineering. In this paper, we present an empirical analysis of 17,163 articles published in 22 leading transportation journals from 1990 to 2015. We apply a latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model on article abstracts to infer 50 key topics. We show that those characterized topics are both representative and meaningful, mostly corresponding to established sub-fields in transportation research. These identified fields reveal a research landscape for transportation. Based on the results of LDA, we quantify the similarity of journals and countries/regions in terms of their aggregated topic distributions. By measuring the variation of topic distributions over time, we find some general research trends, such as topics on sustainability, travel behavior and non-motorized mobility are becoming increasingly popular over time. We also carry out this temporal analysis for each journal, observing a high degree of consistency for most journals. However, some interesting anomaly, such as special issues on particular topics, are detected from temporal variation as well. By quantifying the temporal trends at the country/region level, we find that countries/regions display clearly distinguishable patterns, suggesting that research communities in different regions tend to focus on different sub-fields. Our results could benefit different parties in the academic community—including researchers, journal editors and funding agencies—in terms of identifying promising research topics/projects, seeking for candidate journals for a submission, and realigning focus for journal development.","Research policy,Topic modeling,Transportation research,Publication data,"
"maritime situation analysis framework: vessel interaction classification and anomaly detection","2015","Maritime domain awareness is critical for protecting sea lanes, ports, harbors, offshore structures like oil and gas rigs and other types of critical infrastructure against common threats and illegal activities. Typical examples range from smuggling of drugs and weapons, human trafficking and piracy all the way to terror attacks. Limited surveillance resources constrain maritime domain awareness and compromise full security coverage at all times. This situation calls for innovative intelligent systems for interactive situation analysis to assist marine authorities and security personal in their routine surveillance operations. In this article, we propose a novel situation analysis approach to analyze marine traffic data and differentiate various scenarios of vessel engagement for the purpose of detecting anomalies of interest for marine vessels that operate over some period of time in relative proximity to each other. We consider such scenarios as probabilistic processes and analyze complex vessel trajectories using machine learning to model common patterns. Specifically, we represent patterns as left-to-right Hidden Markov Models and classify them using Support Vector Machines. To differentiate suspicious activities from unobjectionable behavior, we explore fusion of data and information, including kinematic features, geospatial features, contextual information and maritime domain knowledge. Our experimental evaluation shows the effectiveness of the proposed approach using comprehensive real-world vessel tracking data from coastal waters of North America.","Kinematics,surveillance,hidden Markov models,interactive situation analysis,Hidden Markov models,Geospatial analysis,anomaly detection,Anomaly Detection,maritime domain awareness,marine traffic data analysis,data fusion,information fusion,data analysis,Maritime Domain Awareness,vessel engagement,routine surveillance operations,marine engineering,support vector machines,kinematic features,probabilistic processes,geospatial features,machine learning,left-to-right hidden Markov models,vessel interaction classification,innovative intelligent systems,pattern classification,contextual information,Time series analysis,maritime situation analysis framework,Critical Infrastructure Protection,Big Data,vessel tracking data,Trajectory,Machine Learning,probability,complex vessel trajectory analysis,pattern representation,traffic engineering computing,Surveillance,maritime domain knowledge,marine vehicles,Intelligent Systems,learning (artificial intelligence),Security,security,"
"on the effectiveness of ai-assisted anomaly detection methods in maritime navigation","2020","The automatic identification system (AIS) has become an essential tool for maritime security. Nevertheless, how to effectively use the static and dynamic voyage information of the AIS data in maritime traffic situation awareness is still a challenge. This paper presents a comparative study of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques on their effectiveness in dealing with various anomalies in maritime domain using the AIS data. The AIS on-off switching (OOS) anomaly is critical in maritime security, since AIS technology is susceptible to manipulation and it can be switched on and off to hide illegal activities. Thus, we try to detect and distinguish between intentional and non-intentional AIS OOS anomalies through our AI -assisted anomaly detection framework. We use AIS data, in particular positional and navigational status of vessels, to study the effectiveness of seven AI techniques, such as artificial neural network, support vector machine, logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, decision tree, random forest and naive Bayes, in detecting the AIS OOS anomalies. Our experimental results show that ANN and SVM are the most suitable techniques in detecting the AIS OOS anomalies with 99.9% accuracy. Interestingly, the ANN model outperforms others when trained with a balanced (i.e., same order of samples per class) dataset, and SVM, on the other hand, is suitable when training dataset is unbalanced.","maritime traffic situation awareness,AI-assisted anomaly detection,decision trees,Support vector machines,logistic regression,Anomaly detection,static voyage information,random forests,ANN,marine navigation,Feature extraction,security of data,maritime security,k-nearest neighbors,regression analysis,AIS technology,naive Bayes,neural nets,naive Bayes methods,automatic identification system,marine safety,marine engineering,support vector machines,maritime navigation,dynamic voyage information,maritime domain,random forest,SVM,Artificial intelligence,AIS on-off switching anomaly,nearest neighbour methods,artificial neural network,Training,Trajectory,support vector machine,nonintentional AIS OOS anomalies,Navigation,artificial intelligence,decision tree,AIS data,"
"context-enhanced vessel prediction based on ornstein-uhlenbeck processes using historical ais traffic patterns: real-world experimental results","2014","Traffic route analysis and prediction are both essential for maritime security. Specifically, the prediction of a vessel position is useful to provide alerts about upcoming events (e.g., opportunities and threats). However, accurate prediction along a route in the maritime domain is a challenging task, due to the complex and dynamic nature of traffic patterns. This paper presents a vessel prediction method, based on the popular Ornstein-Uhlenbeck stochastic processes, whose parameters are estimated from historical patterns of life. The historical traffic routes are obtained by pre-processing Automatic Identification System (AIS) data via the CMRE tool called Traffic Route Extraction for Anomaly Detection (TREAD). These recurrent routes allow prediction of the position of a vessel that is following one of these routes, surprisingly, by several hours. The method is validated using a case study related to the second data campaign of the EC FP7 Project New Service Capabilities for Integrated and Advanced Maritime Surveillance (NEREIDS)1. We demonstrate that the prediction accuracy is well represented by the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model.","surveillance,New Service Capabilities for Integrated and Advanced Maritime Surveillance,anomaly detection,security of data,Stochastic processes,Predictive models,Transmitters,historical AIS traffic pattern,vessel position prediction uncertainty,context enhanced vessel prediction method,NEREIDS,automatic identification system,CMRE tool,stochastic processes,marine engineering,Target tracking,maritime domain,Radar tracking,Real-time systems,Ornstein-Uhlenbeck stochastic process,traffic route extraction,traffic engineering computing,parameter estimation,Data mining,traffic route analysis,EC FP7 Project,"
"a cloud based architecture capable of perceiving and predicting multiple vessel behaviour","2015","Progressively huge amounts of data, tracking vessels during their voyages across the seas, are becoming available, mostly due to the automatic identification system (AIS) that vessels of specific categories are required to carry. These datasets provide detailed insights into the patterns vessels follow, while safely navigating across the globe, under various conditions. In this paper, we develop an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) capable of predicting a vessels future behaviour (position, speed and course), based on events that occur in a predictable pattern, across large map areas. The main concept of this study is to determine if an ANN is capable of inferring the unique behavioural patterns that each vessel follows and successively use this as a means for predicting multiple vessel behaviour into a future point in time. We design, train and implement a proof of concept ANN, as a cloud based web application, with the ability of overlaying predicted short and long term vessel behaviour on an interactive map. Our proposed approach could potentially assist in busy port scheduling, vessel route planning, anomaly detection and increasing overall Maritime Domain Awareness.","Vessel behaviour prediction,Soft computing applications,Artificial Neural Network,Automated identification system,Maritime Domain Awareness,"
"detecting anomalies from a multitarget tracking output","2014","Surveillance systems typically incorporate multitarget tracking algorithms for sequential estimation of kinematic states (e.g. positions, velocities) of moving objects in the surveillance domain of interest. This letter proposes an algorithm for online detection of anomalies in the motion and the count of objects, using the output of a multiobject tracking algorithm. The surveillance area is partitioned by a square grid and the kinematic states that fall inside each cell of the grid are modelled by a Poisson point process. During the unsupervised learning phase, the parameters of the Poisson point process are estimated for each cell. The testing phase is performed sequentially by threshold detection at a specified level of significance. The performance of the algorithm is illustrated using the Automatic Identification System (AIS) dataset in the context of maritime surveillance.","Kinematics,Kernel,multiobject tracking algorithm,Vectors,Poisson point process,sequential estimation,target tracking,unsupervised learning phase,multitarget tracking algorithms,Testing,object tracking,automatic identification system dataset,maritime surveillance,Partitioning algorithms,Tracking,online anomaly detection,Surveillance,kinematic states,video surveillance,"
"outlier detection approach for discovering anomalous maritime profiles","2023","Maritime authorities play a key role in ensuring the safety and security of shipping lanes and ports. The port state control mechanism enables these authorities to physically verify suspect vessels (e.g., involved in smuggling or piracy events), but choosing the most relevant vessels to be inspected represents a challenging task. This decision can be enhanced by AI-powered systems that analyse large amounts of data, identify patterns and report all observed discrepancies. This paper presents a statistical analysis on the temporal durations of four types of naval statuses: sailing, docked in port, waiting at anchor and not transmitting AIS data. These durations were extracted from the historical activity of different classes of vessels that passed the Black Sea region (Romanian Exclusive Economic Zone) in 2022. Probability density functions were built for these vessels and all statuses' durations were fitted into known parametric distributions. Finally, the paper shows the results of multiple outlier detection algorithms that searched for anomalous data in a multivariate manner.","shipping lanes,probability density functions,Electric potential,Safety,unsupervised learning,naval statuses,public administration,Black Sea region,maritime authorities,outlier detection,Probability density function,temporal durations,port state control,statistical analysis,ships,port state control mechanism,marine safety,marine engineering,observed discrepancies,anomalous maritime profiles,AIS,Seaports,historical activity,Artificial intelligence,sea ports,maritime anomaly detection,Statistical analysis,anomalous data,smuggling,AIS data,Romanian exclusive economic zone,outlier detection approach,probability,AI-powered systems,Security,production engineering computing,data handling,suspect vessels,"
"malicious ais spoofing and abnormal stealth deviations: a comprehensive statistical framework for maritime anomaly detection","2021","The automatic identification system (AIS) is an essential and economical equipment for collision avoidance and maritime surveillance. However, AIS can be subject to intentional reporting of false information, or â€œspoofingâ€. This article assumes the vessel trajectory nominally follows a piecewise mean-reverting process; thereby, it addresses the problem of establishing whether a vessel is reporting adulterated position information through AIS messages in order to hide its current planned route and a possible deviation from the nominal route. Multiple hypothesis testing suggests a framework to enlist reliable information from monitoring systems (coastal radars and space-born satellite sensors) in support of detection of anomalies, spoofing, and stealth deviations.

Our algorithms take real-time tracking information and learn motion pattern models on-the-fly, enabling the models to adapt well to evolving situations while maintaining high levels of performance. The constantly refined models, resulting from concurrent incremental learning, are used to evaluate the behavior patterns of vessels based on their present motion states. At the event level, learning provides the capability to detect (and alert) upon anomalous behavior. At a higher (inter-event) level, learning enables predictions, over pre-defined time horizons, to be made about future vessel location. Predictions can also be used to alert on anomalous behavior.

"a spectral-based clustering for structural health monitoring of the sydney harbour bridge","2017","This paper presents the results of a large scale Structural Health Monitoring application on the Sydney Harbour Bridge in Australia. This bridge has many structural components, and our work focuses on a subset of 800 jack arches under the traffic lane 7. Our goal is to identify which of these jack arches (if any) respond differently to the traffic input, due to potential structural damages or instrumentation issues. We propose a novel non-model-based method to achieve this objective, using a spectrum-driven feature based on the Spectral Moments (SMs) from measured responses from the jack arches. SMs contain information from the entire frequency range, thus subtle differences between the normal signals and distorted ones could be identified. Our method then applies a modified k-means−− clustering algorithm to these features, followed by a selection mechanism on the clustering results to identify jack arches with abnormal responses. We performed an extensive evaluation of the proposed method using real data from the bridge. This evaluation included a control component, where the approach successfully detected jack arches with already known damage or issues. It also included a test component, which applied the method to a large set of nodes over a month of data to detect any potential anomaly. The detected anomalies turned out to have indeed system issues after further investigations.","Structural Health Monitoring,-means−−,Spectral Moment,Anomaly Detection,Power Spectral Density,Clustering,"
"anomaly detection and tracking based on meanâ€“reverting processes with unknown parameters","2019","Piecewise mean-reverting stochastic processes have been recently proposed and validated as an effective model for long-term object prediction. In this paper, we exploit the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) dynamic model to represent an anomaly as any deviation of the long-run mean velocity from the nominal condition. This amounts to modeling the anomaly as an unknown switching control input that can affect the dynamics of the object. Under this model, the problem of joint anomaly detection and tracking can be addressed within the Bayesian random set framework by means of a hybrid Bernoulli filter (HBF) that sequentially estimates a Bernoulli random set (empty under nominal behavior) for the unknown long-run mean velocity, and a random vector for the kinematic state of the object. An additional challenge is represented by the fact that two extra parameters, i.e. the reversion rate and the noise covariance of the underlying OU process, need to be specified for Bayes-optimal prediction.

"detecting anomalous deviations from standard maritime routes using the ornsteinâ€“uhlenbeck process","2018","A novel anomaly detection procedure based on the Ornsteinâ€“Uhlenbeck (OU) mean-reverting stochastic process is presented. The considered anomaly is a vessel that deviates from a planned route, changing its nominal velocity $\boldsymbol{v}_0$. In order to hide this behavior, the vessel switches off its automatic identification system (AIS) device for a time  $T$ and then tries to revert to the previous nominal velocity $\boldsymbol{v}_0$. The decision that has to be made is declaring that a deviation either happened or not, relying only upon two consecutive AIS contacts. Furthermore, the extension to the scenario in which multiple contacts (e.g., radar) are available during the time period $T$ is also considered. A proper statistical hypothesis testing procedure that builds on the changes in the OU process long-term velocity parameter $\boldsymbol{v}_0$ of the vessel is the core of the proposed approach and enables the solution of the anomaly detection problem.

"identifying industrial heat sources using time-series of the viirs nightfire product with an object-oriented approach","2018","Carbon-based fuels burned at industrial facilities account for a large proportion of greenhouse gas emissions, and an up-to-date spatiotemporally detailed inventory is essential for a better understanding of global carbon emission patterns. The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Nightfire product offers a quantitative estimation of the temperatures of sub-pixel heat sources, providing the potential for detecting thermal anomalies from industrial sectors across the globe. However, identifying subcategories of various industrial heat sources is challenging because there are scarcely any stable and typical characteristics for their classification at a single thermal anomaly scale. Specifically, these nighttime thermal anomalies exhibit a strong spatiotemporal heterogeneity (e.g., fluctuations in retrieved temperature, spatial shifts in position, and presence of false positives), even in industrial heat sources that do not vary through time. Here, we demonstrate an object-oriented approach to robustly segment and accurately classify various industrial heat sources from a time-series of the VIIRS Nightfire product. The approach operates from the cluster level of spatially adjacent nighttime thermal anomalies (i.e., nighttime-heat-source objects rather than individual thermal anomalies) to generate fingerprint-like characteristics and to address the challenge of spatiotemporal heterogeneity. Specifically, the spatial-aggregation characteristic of nighttime thermal anomalies from continuously operating industrial heat sources and the temporal-aggregation characteristics of biomass burnings were incorporated to differentiate industrial nighttime-heat-source objects from ubiquitous biomass burnings. Subsequently, the similarity of the thermal signals of nighttime thermal anomalies from identical industrial heat sources was used to generate highly recognizable characteristics for their identification. A spatiotemporally detailed inventory of industrial heat sources across the globe was then established from this object-oriented classification. The inventory included a total of 15,199 industrial heat sources, representing 49.52% of all higher confidence nighttime thermal anomalies in the VIIRS Nightfire product. Validation of the results showed that only 218 objects (1.43%) were biomass burnings or active volcanoes that were misclassified as industrial heat sources. Further validation of sub-categories indicated an overall classification accuracy of ~77%. Our findings suggest that the VIIRS Nightfire product has great potential for monitoring the global distribution and dynamics of industrial heat sources, and combined with the object-oriented approach developed here the methodology is simple, robust, and cost-effective.","Nightfire product,Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS),Object-oriented analysis,Identification,Industrial heat sources,Time-series,"
"random finite set tracking for anomaly detection in the presence of clutter","2020","In this paper, a sequential Bayesian framework is proposed to address the task of joint anomaly detection and tracking for surveillance applications in the presence of clutter.

Random Finite Sets (RFS) make it possible to represent the switching nature of the object anomalous behavior and derive a hybrid Bernoulli filter (HBF) that sequentially updates the joint posterior density of a Bernoulli RFS for the unknown velocity input and the object kinematic state. In addition, the proposed HBF has been customized for maritime anomaly detection by using a piecewise Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) stochastic process as dynamic model of vessels.

"cognitively-inspired motion pattern learning & analysis algorithms for higher-level fusion and automated scene understanding","2007","We have developed a suite of neurobiologically inspired algorithms for exploiting track data to learn normal patterns of motion behavior, detect deviations from normalcy, and predict future behavior. These capabilities contribute to higher-level fusion situational awareness and assessment objectives. They also provide essential elements for automated scene understanding to shift operator focus from sensor monitoring and activity detection to assessment and response. Our learning algorithms learn behavioral patterns at a variety of conceptual, spatial, and temporal levels to reduce a massive amount of track data to a rich set of information regarding their field of regard that supports decision-making and timely response initiation. Continuous incremental learning enables the models of normal behavior to adapt well to evolving situations while maintaining high levels of performance. Deviations from normalcy result in reports being published directly to operator displays or to other reasoning components within a larger system. Deviation tolerance levels are user settable during system operation to tune alerting sensitivity. Operator (or other system component) responses to anomaly alerts can be fed back into the algorithms to further enhance and refine learned models. These algorithms have been successfully demonstrated to learn vessel behaviors across the maritime domain and to learn vehicle and dismount behavior in land-based settings.","Motion detection,Pattern analysis,Decision making,Algorithm design and analysis,Layout,Motion analysis,Computerized monitoring,Displays,Vehicles,Tracking,"
"hybrid bernoulli filtering for detection and tracking of anomalous path deviations","2018","This paper presents a solution to the problem of sequential joint anomaly detection and tracking of a target subject to switching unknown path deviations. Based on a dynamic model described by Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) stochastic processes, the anomaly is represented by a target (e.g., a marine vessel) that deviates from a preset route by changing its nominal mean velocity. The Random Finite Set (RFS) framework is used to represent the switching nature of target's anomalous behavior in the presence of spurious measurements and detection uncertainty. Combining these two ingredients, the problem of jointly detecting target's path deviations and estimating its kinematic state can be formulated within the Bayesian framework, and analytically solved by means of a hybrid Bernoulli filter that sequentially updates the joint posterior density of the unknown OU velocity input (a Bernoulli RFS) and of the target's state random vector. We illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed filter, implemented in Gaussian-mixture form, in a simulated scenario of vessel tracking for maritime traffic monitoring.","Anomaly detection,switching nature,state random vector,Sea measurements,Stochastic processes,Radio frequency,vessel tracking,hybrid Bernoulli filtering,target tracking,Random Finite Set framework,stochastic processes,filtering theory,hybrid Bernoulli filter,Target tracking,object detection,Gaussian processes,Bayesian framework,Artificial intelligence,anomalous path deviations,unknown OU velocity input,nominal mean velocity,Surveillance,marine vessel,joint posterior density,sequential joint anomaly detection,"

"forecasting the impact of an 1859-calibre superstorm on satellite resources","2006","We have developed simple models to assess the economic impacts to the current satellite resource caused by the worst-case scenario of a hypothetical superstorm event occurring during the next sunspot cycle. Although the consequences may be severe, our worse-case scenario does not include the complete failure of the entire 937 operating satellites in the current population, which have a replacement value of ∼$170–230 billion, and supporting a ∼$90 billion/year industry. Our estimates suggest a potential economic loss of <$70 billion for lost revenue (∼$44 billion) and satellite replacement for GEO satellites (∼$24 billion) caused by a ‘once a century’ single storm similar to the 1859 superstorm. We estimate that 80 satellites (LEO, MEO, and GEO) may be disabled as a consequence of a superstorm event. Additional impacts may include the failure of many of the GPS, GLONASS, and Galileo satellite systems in MEO. Approximately 97 LEO satellites, which normally would not have re-entered for many decades, may prematurely de-orbit by ca 2021 as a result of the temporarily increased atmospheric drag caused by a superstorm event occurring in ca. 2012. The $100 billion International Space Station may lose significant altitude, placing it in critical need for re-boosting by an amount potentially outside the range of typical Space Shuttle operations, which are in any case scheduled to end in 2010. Currently, the ability to forecast extreme particle events and coronal mass ejections, or predict their fluences and geoseverity in the 24-h prior to the event, appears to be no better than 50/50. Our analysis of economic impacts is a first attempt at estimation whose approach will suggest ways in which better estimates may eventually be obtained.","Satellite anomalies,Radiation sickness,Technology impacts,Satellite failures,Space weather,Superstorms,Economic impacts,"
"from unsupervised to semi-supervised anomaly detection methods for hrrp targets","2020","Responding to the challenge of detecting unusual radar targets in a well identified environment, innovative anomaly and novelty detection methods keep emerging in the literature. This work aims at presenting a benchmark gathering common and recently introduced unsupervised anomaly detection (AD) methods, the results being generated using high-resolution range profiles. A semi-supervised AD (SAD) is considered to demonstrate the added value of having a few labeled anomalies to improve performances. Experiments were conducted with and without pollution of the training set with anomalous samples in order to be as close as possible to real operational contexts. The common AD methods composing our baseline will be One-Class Support Vector Machines (OC-SVM), Isolation Forest (IF), Local Outlier Factor (LOF) and a Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE). The more innovative AD methods put forward by this work are Deep Support Vector Data Description (Deep SVDD) and Random Projection Depth (RPD), belonging respectively to deep and shallow AD. The semi-supervised adaptation of Deep SVDD constitutes our SAD method. HRRP data was generated by a coastal surveillance radar, our results thus suggest that AD can contribute to enhance maritime and coastal situation awareness.","semisupervised anomaly detection methods,Pollution,unusual radar targets,benchmark gathering,Support vector machines,Anomaly detection,radar detection,HRRP targets,anomaly detection,unsupervised learning,high-resolution range profiles,Neural networks,semisupervised adaptation,novelty detection methods,radar target detection,radar computing,innovative anomaly,support vector machines,SAD method,machine learning,object detection,radar target recognition,innovative AD methods,search radar,identified environment,Deep SVDD,high-resolution range profile,Radar,common AD methods,convolutional neural nets,labeled anomalies,Training,One-Class Support Vector Machines,neural network,semisupervised AD,Radar detection,"
"maritime anomaly detection based on mean-reverting stochastic processes applied to a real-world scenario","2018","A novel anomaly detection procedure is presented, based on the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) mean-reverting stochastic process. The considered anomaly is a vessel that deviates from a planned route, changing its nominal velocity. In order to hide this behavior, the vessel switches off its Automatic Identification System (AIS) device for a certain time, and then tries to revert to the previous nominal velocity. The decision that has to be taken is either declaring that a deviation happened or not, relying only upon two consecutive AIS contacts. A proper statistical hypothesis testing procedure that builds on the changes in the OU process long-term velocity parameter of the vessel is the core of the proposed approach and enables for the solution of the anomaly detection problem.","real-world data,Anomaly detection,Marine vehicles,mean-reverting stochastic process,security of data,maritime security,Stochastic processes,proper statistical hypothesis testing procedure,target tracking,statistical analysis,Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process,OU process long-term velocity parameter,automatic identification system,automatic identification system device,stochastic processes,marine engineering,AIS,nominal velocity,Artificial intelligence,maritime anomaly detection,vessel switches,Trajectory,statistical hypothesis test,Ornstein-Uhlenbeck,Transponders,planned route,Navigation,"
"geotracknetâ€”a maritime anomaly detector using probabilistic neural network representation of ais tracks and a contrario detection","2022","Representing maritime traffic patterns and detecting anomalies from them are key to vessel monitoring and maritime situational awareness. We propose a novel approachâ€”referred to as GeoTrackNetâ€”for maritime anomaly detection from AIS data streams. Our model exploits state-of-the-art neural network schemes to learn a probabilistic representation of AIS tracks and a contrario detection to detect abnormal events. The neural network provides a new means to capture complex and heterogeneous patterns in vesselsâ€™ behaviours, while the a contrario detector takes into account the fact that the learnt distribution may be location-dependent. Experiments on a real AIS dataset comprising more than 4.2 million AIS messages demonstrate the relevance of the proposed method compared with state-of-the-art schemes.","heterogeneous patterns,motion estimation,GeoTrackNet,naval engineering computing,Anomaly detection,Geospatial analysis,anomaly detection,probabilistic representation,variational recurrent neural networks,AIS messages,maritime traffic patterns,maritime anomaly detector,AIS dataset,maritime situational awareness,neural nets,probabilistic neural network representation,deep learning,ships,marine engineering,AIS data streams,complex patterns,contrario detection,AIS,maritime surveillance,object detection,Probabilistic logic,a contrario detection,Artificial intelligence,maritime anomaly detection,Trajectory,Task analysis,vessel monitoring,contrario detector,learning (artificial intelligence),state-of-the-art neural network schemes,Detectors,AIS tracks,"

"neighborhood rough residual networkâ€“based outlier detection method in iot-enabled maritime transportation systems","2023","Outlier detection can identify anomalies in large-scale data. To provide reliability and security for Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled maritime transportation systems (MTSs), in this paper we propose an outlier detection method based on the neighborhood rough residual network (NRRN). We calculate the neighborhood approximation accuracy and neighborhood conditional entropy to obtain the neighborhood combined entropy describing the discrimination ability of the condition attribute subset to the information system. We then delete the redundant attributes according to the attribute combination importance derived from the neighborhood combined entropy. The data after attribute reduction are used to train the convolutional neural network, and the residual network (ResNet50) is used to avoid the degradation of model performance caused by the increase in the number of network layers. The proposed method is compared with mainstream outlier detection algorithms on a fishing vessel operation dataset. Experiments show that the proposed method can greatly improve the accuracy of outlier detection while taking into account interpretability and computational efficiency, thereby ensuring the data integrity of IoT-enabled MTSs.","Outlier detection,Data models,residual network,neighborhood combined entropy,Transportation,Entropy,data integrity,Anomaly detection,Behavioral sciences,Marine vehicles,Residual neural networks,IoT-enabled maritime transportation systems,"
"leveraging graph and deep learning uncertainties to detect anomalous maritime trajectories","2022","Understanding and representing traffic patterns are key to detecting anomalous trajectories in the transportation domain. However, some trajectories can exhibit heterogeneous maneuvering characteristics despite confining to normal patterns. Thus, we propose a novel graph-based trajectory representation and association scheme for extraction and confederation of traffic movement patterns, such that data patterns and uncertainty can be learned by deep learning (DL) models. This paper proposes the usage of a recurrent neural network (RNN)-based evidential regression model, which can predict trajectory at future timesteps as well as estimate the data and model uncertainties associated, to detect anomalous maritime trajectories, such as unusual vessel maneuvering, using automatic identification system (AIS) data. Furthermore, we utilize evidential deep learning classifiers to detect unusual turns of vessels and the loss of transmitted signal using predicted class probabilities with associated uncertainties. Our experimental results suggest that the graphical representation of traffic patterns improves the ability of the DL models, such as evidential and Monte Carlo dropout, to learn the temporal-spatial correlation of data and associated uncertainties. Using different datasets and experiments, we demonstrate that the estimated prediction uncertainty yields fundamental information for the detection of traffic anomalies in the maritime and, possibly in other domains.","Monte Carlo methods,classification,recurrent neural nets,graph,deep learning (artificial intelligence),Anomaly detection,DL models,graph-based trajectory representation,automatic identification system data,Monte Carlo dropout,graphical representation,traffic movement patterns,detect anomalous maritime trajectories,Predictive models,regression analysis,evidential deep learning,marine engineering,Data models,data patterns,pattern classification,Artificial intelligence,graph theory,RNN,regression,clustering,uncertainty,Trajectory,Uncertainty,probability,Computational modeling,traffic engineering computing,recurrent neural network-based evidential regression model,deep learning uncertainties,AIS data,"
"bayesian filtering for dynamic anomaly detection and tracking","2022","This article presents a Bayesian approach for sequential detection of anomalies in the motion of a target and joint tracking. The anomaly is modeled as a binary (on/off) switching unknown control input that goes into action (begins to exist, or â€œswitches onâ€) thereby modifying the object dynamics; and by ceasing its activity (becoming nonexistent, or â€œswitching offâ€) returns the dynamics to nominal. The developed Bayesian framework brings together random finite set (RFS) theory to represent the switching nature of the anomaly, and optimal joint input and state estimation to sequentially update a hybrid state that incorporates a random vector for the kinematic state and a Bernoulli RFS for the unknown control input. In addition, a closed-form solution, the Gaussian-mixture hybrid Bernoulli filter (GM-HBF), has been developed to provide a customized solution for dynamic anomaly detection in the maritime domain characterized by linear Gaussian target dynamics. Based on the Ornsteinâ€“Uhlenbeck dynamic model for vessels, where the evolution of the object velocity is governed by a piecewise mean-reverting stochastic process, the anomaly can be represented by a change in the long-run mean velocity (i.e., the unknown control input) from the nominal condition that forces the vessel to deviate from its standard route. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed GM-HBF in both simulated and real-world maritime surveillance applications and test its performance in the face of false measurements, detection uncertainty, and sensor data gaps.","developed Bayesian framework,surveillance,kinematic state,Mathematical models,Anomaly detection,Automatic identification system (AIS),Bayesian approach,random finite sets (RFSs),Bayesian filtering,Bayes methods,object dynamics,linear Gaussian target dynamics,Switches,Bernoulli filter,switching unknown control input,Radio frequency,target tracking,Aerodynamics,stochastic processes,filtering theory,radar,state estimation,detection uncertainty,Gaussian processes,Bernoulli RFS,Radar tracking,maritime anomaly detection,dynamic anomaly detection,joint input and state estimation (JISE),probability,Ornstein-Uhlenbeck dynamic model,GM-HBF,Gaussian-mixture hybrid Bernoulli filter,"
