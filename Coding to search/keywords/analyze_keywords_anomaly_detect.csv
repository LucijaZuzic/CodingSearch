"a novel quality control method of time-series ocean wave observation data combining deep-learning prediction and statistical analysis","2023","Quality control (QC) of marine data is a critical aspect in ensuring the usability of oceanic data. In this paper, we propose a novel QC method for time-series ocean wave data, which combines deep learning prediction and statistical analysis. Our method first realizes multi-element LSTM prediction of the time-series ocean wave observation data, capturing both temporal consistency and physical relationships between the multi-element inputs. Then, it applies peak detection on the regional mean difference ratio derived from the predicted and true values of the ocean wave data, and finally labels the anomalous data points based on peak detection results. We conducted experiments on the time-series wave data of four sites from the National Marine Science Center, China, and compared our proposed method with traditional QC method that is currently used for operational marine data quality control, as well as classic anomaly detection models including Isolation Forest and VAE-LSTM. The results show a significant improvement in the Precision, Recall, and F1 Score for erroneous samples using our proposed method. Our proposed method takes advantages of both deep learning and statistical analysis and considers physical correlation of multiple elements of marine data, effectively addressing the problem of erroneous discrimination of abnormal sea conditions in the traditional method, and providing valuable insights for the study of marine time-series observational data.","Deep-learning prediction,Time-series data,Statistical analysis,Quality control,"
"maritime anomaly detection in a real-world scenario: ever given grounding in the suez canal","2022","In this paper we present how automatic maritime anomaly detection tools can be successfully applied in real-world situations such as the major event of the container vessel Ever Given, which grounded in the Suez Canal on March 23rd 2021. The anomaly detector is designed to process the available sequence of Automatic Identification System (AIS) reports, information from ground-based or satellite radar systems if available, and contextual information defining the expected nominal behavior of navigation. A statistical hypothesis testing procedure is sequentially run to decide whether or not a deviation from the nominal behavior happened within a specific time period, for instance two consecutive data points. We show, based on the recorded AIS data from the Ever Given, that the proposed detector could have been triggered and alerted to anomalous behavior fully 19 minutes before the grounding.","anomaly detector,Anomaly detection,Marine vehicles,Grounding,statistical hypothesis testing,Ever Given grounding,automatic maritime anomaly detection tools,statistical analysis,Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process,Testing,ships,Containers,automatic identification system,radar,maritime surveillance,satellite radar systems,contextual information,container vessel,Suez Canal,Artificial intelligence,ground-based system,marine engineering computing,Maritime anomaly detection,Irrigation,statistical hypothesis testing procedure,expected nominal behavior,AIS data,"
"the lama system: a “smart” magnetometer network for harbour protection","2022","This work describes the development of an underwater anti-intrusion system based on a magnetometer self-informed network, whose purpose is to detect the presence of threats in the proximity of critical infrastructures (e.g, terrorist divers in harbours). In this context, the magnetic network fills the gaps of sonar systems at the critical boundaries of the water volume to be controlled (sea bed, docks, …), where acoustic performances deteriorate due to reflections and attenuations. The system operates in a port-protection scenario, characterized by a medium-high environmental magnetic noise that can hide the diver signal (a diver is a weak, quasi-point-like, moving source). The magnetometer network processes two inputs: the environmental magnetic noise and a signal including the target magnetic signal superimposed to the same noise; the frequencies of a diver signal lie within the noise band, hence frequency filtering proves inadequate for noise removal. The basic idea underlying the system is to measure and use the noise itself to filter the overall signal; measuring noise supports a background-subtraction process that allows to extract the target signal and therefore detect the threat presence. The effectiveness of the procedure depends on the positions of magnetometers: sensors must be close enough to one another to measure the common background noise, and, at the same time, should be distant enough from one another so that just one sensor can measure the target signal. To generate alarms when a threat is detected, a real-time software application processes data and activates a visual and acoustic alarm upon identification of a magnetic anomaly. Sea trials carried out in port areas provided extremely satisfactory results in the detection of intruders. The paper presents experimental results obtained during the method validation tests, when intruders were moving in the surrounding undersea environment.","Environmental magnetism,Marine geophysics,Time series analysis,Magnetic anomaly detection,Underwater magnetic systems,Harbour protection,"
"vessel track information mining using ais data","2014","In recent years, vessel traffic and maritime situation awareness become more and more important for countries across the world. AIS data contains much information about vessel motion and reflects traffic characteristics. In this paper, data mining is introduced to discover motion patterns of vessel movements. Firstly, we do statistical analysis for large scale of AIS data. Secondly, we use association rules to analyze the frequent moving status of vessels. We extend the dimensions of data features, improve the algorithm in efficiency and import the concept of time scale in the algorithm based on the previous relative work. Thirdly, we introduce Markov model to make supplement for the association rules. The prediction results in the Markov process are further used to do the anomaly detection. The method in this paper provides novel idea for the research in AIS data and the management of maritime traffic.","Markov processes,data mining,Clustering algorithms,Association rules,vessel movements,Hidden Markov models,anomaly detection,Marine vehicles,Markov model,vessel traffic,maritime traffic management,statistical analysis,motion patterns,association rules,Data models,Markov,traffic information systems,vessel track information mining,traffic characteristics,maritime situation awareness,frequent moving status,vessel motion,marine vehicles,AIS data,"
"role of rainfall intensity and urban sprawl in the 2014 flash flood in genoa city, bisagno catchment (liguria, italy)","2018","Flash floods are typical for the Mediterranean region, however they have been recurring at increasing frequency over the past few decades especially over the Italian Peninsula. The region of Genoa has recently moved into the international spotlight due to frequent and disastrous flash floods of the Bisagno River and its tributaries as a result of intense autumn rainfall and dense floodplain urbanization. The last flood events even caused loss in human lives, with 6 casualties in 2011 and 1 in 2014. However, it has not yet been investigated whether the increase in these flash flood events is due to a change in rainfall regime or due to urban expansion in areas prone to flash floods. This study investigates the meteorological conditions and the ground effects of the Bisagno River flash flood of October 9th, 2014 in the city of Genoa. Application of a Standard Anomaly Index and a Cluster Analysis reveals a positive trend in intense and short-duration rainfall recorded in the Bisagno Valley for the period of 1945–2016. Urban sprawl in the catchment, assessed through a multi-temporal cartographic and photographic comparison, highlights the progressive and total consumption of land in the floodplain. In the river basin surrounding Genoa the risk of flash floods has increased, both due to a change in rainfall regime and associated increase in discharge but also due to increased vulnerability caused by progressive urban expansion and land use change, including in particular transformations of the Bisagno riverbed. The results obtained demonstrate the need for urgent action to mitigate flood risk by introducing, amongst other measures, a citizen observatory for early warning of flash floods.","Urban sprawl,Italy,Flash flood risk,Rainfall regime variations,Mediterranean area,Genoa,"
"maritime situational awareness forensics tools for a common information sharing environment (cise)","2019","CISE stands for Common Information Sharing Environment and refers to an architecture and set of protocols, procedures and services for the exchange of data and information across Maritime Authorities of EU (European Union) Member States (MS's). In the context of enabling the implementation and adoption of CISE by different MS's, EU has funded a number of projects that enable the development of subsystems and adaptors intended to allow MS's to connect and make use of CISE. In this context, the Integrated Systems Laboratory (ISL) has led the development of the corresponding Hellenic and Cypriot CISE by developing a Control, Command & Information (C2I) system that unifies all partial maritime surveillance systems into one National Situational Picture Management (NSPM) system, and adaptors that allow the interconnection of the corresponding national legacy systems to CISE and the exchange of data, information and requests between the two MS's. Furthermore, a set of forensics tools that allow geospatial & time filtering and detection of anomalies, risk incidents, fake MMSIs, suspicious speed changes, collision paths, and gaps in AIS (Automatic Identification System), have been developed by combining motion models, AI, deep learning and fusion algorithms using data from different databases through CISE. This paper briefly discusses these developments within the EU CISE-2020, Hellenic CISE and CY-CISE projects and the benefits from the sharing of maritime data across CISE for both maritime surveillance and security. The prospect of using CISE for the creation of a considerably rich database that could be used for forensics analysis and detection of suspicious maritime traffic and maritime surveillance is discussed.","EU Member States,surveillance,maritime traffic,CY-CISE projects,Maritime Security,Distributed CISE database,Forensics,security of data,maritime security,common information sharing environment,National Situational Picture Management system,Cypriot CISE,MS,deep learning,automatic identification system,marine engineering,Maritime Surveillance,Databases,AIS,CISE,C2I system,Europe,Information management,corresponding national legacy systems,Control,Artificial intelligence,Hellenic CISE,NSPM system,command and control systems,Command,maritime surveillance systems,control-command-information system,national security,fusion algorithms,integrated systems laboratory,ISL,Surveillance,AI,Tools,learning (artificial intelligence),time filtering,forensics tools,"
"online learning of temporal logic formulae for signal classification","2018","This paper introduces a method for online inference of temporal logic properties from data. Specifically, we tackle the online supervised learning problem. In this setting, the data is in form of a set of pairs of signals and labels and it becomes available over time. We propose an approach for efficiently processing the data incrementally. In particular, when a new instance is presented, the proposed method updates a binary tree that is linked with the inferred Signal Temporal Logic (STL) formula. This approach presents several benefits. Primarily, it allows the refinement of the current formula when more data is acquired. Moreover, the incremental construction offers insights on the trade-off between formula complexity and classification accuracy. We present two case studies to emphasize the characteristics of the proposed algorithm: 1) a fault classification problem in an automotive system and 2) an anomaly detection problem in the maritime environment.","anomaly detection problem,Prediction algorithms,Machine learning,temporal logic formulae,temporal logic,signal classification,signal temporal logic formula,automotive system,Decision trees,formula complexity,trees (mathematics),Impurities,STL,temporal logic properties,Binary trees,Complexity theory,online supervised learning problem,inference mechanisms,maritime environment,incremental construction,Task analysis,binary tree,online inference,learning (artificial intelligence),fault classification problem,"
"online fault detection in autonomous ferries: using fault-type independent spectral anomaly detection","2020","Enthusiasm for ship autonomy is flourishing in the maritime industry. In this context, data-driven prognostics and health management (PHM) systems have emerged as the optimal way to improve operational reliability and system safety. However, further research is needed to enhance the essential actions relating to such a system. Fault detection is the first and most crucial action of any data-driven PHM system. In this article, we propose a fault-type independent spectral anomaly detection algorithm for marine diesel engine degradation in autonomous ferries. The benefits of the algorithm are verified on three fault types where the nature of degradation differs. Both normal operation data and faulty degradation data have been collected from a marine diesel engine using two different engine load profiles. These profiles aim to replicate real autonomous ferry crossing operations, environmental conditions that the ferry may encounter. First, the data are subjected to a feature selection process to remove irrelevant and redundant features. Then, a multiregime normalization method is performed on the data to merge the engine loads into one context. Finally, a variational autoencoder is trained to estimate velocity and acceleration calculations of the anomaly score. Generic and dynamic threshold limits are simultaneously established to detect the fault time step online. The algorithm achieved an accuracy of 97.66% in the final test when the acceleration was used as the fault detector. The results suggest that the algorithm is independent of fault types with different nature of degradation related to the marine diesel engine.","operational reliability,generic threshold limit,acceleration calculation,fault-type independent spectral anomaly detection algorithm,variational autoencoder,engine loads,Anomaly detection,fault detector,reliability,multiregime normalization,Acceleration,ship autonomy,prognostics and health management (PHM),neural nets,Autonomous ferry,autonomous ferry crossing operations,system safety,data analysis,marine systems,ships,marine diesel engine degradation,Prognostics and health management,prognostics and health management system,online fault detection,dynamic threshold limit,Diesel engines,data-driven PHM system,mechanical engineering computing,feature selection,feature selection process,diesel engines,Fault detection,condition monitoring,Degradation,environmental conditions,marine diesel engine,maritime industry,failure analysis,Heuristic algorithms,multiregime normalization method,fault diagnosis,velocity calculation,faulty degradation data,"
"an integrated maritime reasoning and monitoring system","2012","Maritime information systems typically offer system features for data collection, information fusion and the automated construction of a basic recognized maritime picture for human operators. However making sense of maritime situations is still very much an intensive human-based cognitive endeavor. Limited human resources face difficult cognitive challenges in making sense of huge amount of data generated daily by dynamic round-the-clock maritime shipping and port activities. An effective information exploitation system for maritime surveillance and monitoring is expected to be able to augment human-based surveillance and monitoring operations with machine-based computing capabilities to interpret and reason about massive amount of situational information, as well as transforming this knowledge into actionable decision indicators for the human decision makers. The Defence Science & Technology Agency (DSTA) has developed the PACKED model to guide the exploration and development of computing technologies that support human decision making and other cognitive challenges in information rich, complex, and dynamic operational environments. An integrated maritime reasoning and monitoring system illustrates how computing technologies are applied in the areas of Attention, Knowledge, and Comprehension to support situation analysis and monitoring processes for maritime surveillance. The maritime reasoning and monitoring system consist of Bayesian reasoning, entity network analysis, and movement pattern analysis, to integrate, analyze, interpret and reason about maritime data. The Graylist Network Analysis (GNA) engine probes networks of entity-relationships to uncover â€œgraylistedâ€ entities that are closely associated with blacklisted entities. The Movement Pattern Analysis (MPA) engine uncovers common patterns in vessel movements and monitors real-time for maritime traffic data for anomalous vessel movements. The Bayesian network inference engine combines situation information from data sources and analysis results produced by analytical engines such as the GNA and MPA, with Bayesian knowledge models in order to infer probabilities of occurrences of maritime scenarios.","surveillance,naval engineering computing,sensor fusion,Maritime Monitoring System,attention-knowledge-and-comprehension,maritime traffic data,MPA engine,graylist network analysis,Bayes methods,Anomaly Detection,Monitoring,PACKED model,Bayesian reasoning,entity network analysis,decision indicator,information fusion,Bayesian knowledge model,Scenario Modeling,cognitive challenge,marine systems,military computing,data collection,Bayesian network inference engine,human-based cognitive endeavor,anomalous vessel movement,maritime surveillance,entity-relationship,Humans,GNA engine,Relationship Analysis,dynamic round-the-clock maritime shipping,maritime information system,information exploitation system,inference mechanisms,machine-based computing,port activity,Engines,Pattern analysis,Bayesian Reasoning,Trend Analysis,Algorithm design and analysis,Computational modeling,Cognition,maritime reasoning,maritime monitoring system,human-based surveillance,movement pattern analysis,"
"research on ship abnormal behavior detection method based on graph neural network","2022","Because of the existing maritime intelligent supervision, ship abnormal behavior detection ignores the interdependence between different time series of ships and different abnormal behavior characteristics, which leads to poor real-time performance and limited detection accuracy of abnormal detection. This paper explores the mechanism of ship abnormal behavior monitoring and detection based on graph attention network. This mechanism uses a sliding window to generate fixed data input, uses graph attention network to capture the dependence between ship behavior characteristics, and determines the threshold of anomaly according to the sea environment set in this paper.

"a novel model for ship trajectory anomaly detection based on gaussian mixture variational autoencoder","2023","The use of traditional methods in anomaly detection of multi-class ship trajectories showed some limitations in terms of robustness and learning ability of trajectory features. In view of this, an anomaly detection model for ship trajectory data based on Gaussian Mixture Variational Autoencoder (GMVAE) is proposed in this study using an unsupervised classification method. The proposed model modifies Variational Autoencoder (VAE) by changing the inferential distribution of prior distribution and approximate posterior to the Gaussian mixture model. A high-dimensional hidden space is constructed to learn the features of multi-class trajectory data, and the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) method is applied to measure the error between the reconstructed trajectory and the original trajectory in order to judge whether the ship trajectory is abnormal. The Automatic Identification System (AIS) data from the US coastal areas are used to verify the proposed model, and the results are compared with other commonly used models in a manually labeled dataset. The research results indicate that the detection rate of the proposed model is 91.26%, and the false alarm rate is 0.68%, which performs the best. Using the Gaussian mixture model to describe the distribution of hidden space can improve the learning ability of multi-class trajectories of VAE, thus increasing the robustness of the model. This research can provide technical support for ship trajectory data analysis and risk management of maritime transportation.","Trajectory,anomaly detection of ship trajectory,Clustering algorithms,Classification algorithms,Mathematical models,gaussian mixture variational autoencoder (gmvae),unsupervised learning,Gaussian distribution,Marine vehicles,Artificial neural networks,intelligent transportation,AIS,"

"texture anomaly detection in radar imagery","1994","A radar image of the land or sea will contain extended regions of apparently homogeneous textures arising from, for example, forested areas or uniformly driven expanses of water. However, such regions may contain subtle texture anomalies which indicate the presence of a feature of interest such as a change in tree density due to environmental effects, damping of the sea surface due to the presence of pollutants or the presence of land-based or maritime military targets. For this reason, it is of interest to develop methods of detecting anomalies in textured regions. A strategy for texture anomaly detection is to estimate the multi-variate probability density function (PDF) of a texture segment using the whole homogeneous region as training data and then to calculate the likelihood of occurrence of each individual segment within the region given the PDF estimate. Those texture segments with anomalous likelihood values can then be flagged as potential texture anomalies.<>","Image texture analysis,radar imagery,PDF estimate,image texture,texture segment,Statistics,statistical analysis,texture anomaly detection,multi-variate probability density,Radar,radar image,texture segments,radar,"
"graph representation learning with encoding edges","2019","Network embedding aims at learning the low dimensional representation of nodes. These representations can be widely used for network mining tasks, such as link prediction, anomaly detection, and classification. Recently, a great deal of meaningful research work has been carried out on this emerging network analysis paradigm. The real-world network contains different size clusters because of the edges with different relationship types. These clusters also reflect some features of nodes, which can contribute to the optimization of the feature representation of nodes. However, existing network embedding methods do not distinguish these relationship types. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised network representation learning model that can encode edge relationship information. Firstly, an objective function is defined, which can learn the edge vectors by implicit clustering. Then, a biased random walk is designed to generate a series of node sequences, which are put into Skip-Gram to learn the low dimensional node representations. Extensive experiments are conducted on several network datasets. Compared with the state-of-art baselines, the proposed method is able to achieve favorable and stable results in multi-label classification and link prediction tasks.","Edge representation,Feature learning,Network mining,Network embedding,"

"consumer welfare and climate change in greenland","2019","This manuscript aims to assess the potential impact of climate change on consumer welfare in Greenland, an arctic economy that has been historically affected by climate variation. Three proxies for climate change: (i) annual mass change anomaly of the ice cap, (ii) annual temperature anomalies, and (iii) annual heating degree days anomalies are used to test the hypothesis that climate is a potential determinant of consumer expenditure. The Quadratic Almost Ideal Demand System, in its original specification, is used to test this hypothesis. The empirical analysis, supported by Granger-causality tests, shows that the annual mass change anomaly of the ice cap is a statistically and economically significant determinant of consumption of non-durable goods in Greenland. A counterfactual analysis predicts that climate change could have decreased the wealth of consumers with an aggregate cumulative social welfare loss of 2010-US$ 21.63 million between 2003 and 2017.","Consumer welfare,Transfer entropy causality,Maximum entropy econometrics,Melting Arctic ice,Greenland,Climate change,"
"varying-scale hca-dbscan-based anomaly detection method for multi-dimensional energy data in steel industry","2023","The quality of the acquisition data in the energy system of steel industry is the basis of prediction analysis and scheduling operation. Facing with its multi-dimensional and high-noise characteristics, in this study, an anomaly detection method based on a varying-scale hypercube accelerated density based spatial clustering for applications with noise (VHCA-DBSCAN) is proposed. An HCA-DBSCAN model based on the Gaussian probability density estimation is firstly established, in which the searching radius is adaptively calculated to identify the suspected outliers efficiently. Then, a traversal search strategy for hypercube segmentation is designed, where the lengths of the edges are varying according to the characteristics of each dimension. Finally, a modified local outlier factor (LOF) by using the approximate upper boundary is presented to evaluate the degree of the suspected outliers, and the confirmed ones are identified by collaboratively considering the manufacturing signals. Validation experiments by employing real-world data from a typical steel enterprise are carried out, and the results indicate that the proposed method exhibits reliable performance and high efficiency when facing with the anomaly detection problem of multi-dimensional industrial data.","Anomaly detection,Varying-scale HCA-DBSCAN,Multi-dimensional energy data,Steel industry,"

Governmental and private initiatives have developed monitoring systems with improved acquisition and analysis capabilities. These systems rely on one major component, namely the detection of abnormal ship behaviour. This implies a detailed formalisation of expert knowledge. However, the quantity of data, the complexity of situations, the failure to take into account their spatial characteristics and the potential for the same scenario to be interpreted in different ways have proved to be significant problems.

"estimation of dipole magnetic moment orientation based on magnetic signature waveform analysis by a magnetic sensor","2020","In this paper, we propose a measurement procedure to estimate the magnetic moment orientation (MMO) of a dipole. Theoretical analysis indicates that magnetic field in each orthogonal direction Bi (i = x, y, z) is found to be a superposition of its three basic elements Bij (i = x, y, z and j = 1, 2, 3) along certain direction, allowing the obtained dipole signature to be decomposed of 9 basic elements. An orthogonal energy ratio (OER) algorithm is used to infer the MMO by calculating the signal energy distribution along each axis. A standard OER database is developed which provides a reference to be compared with the measured OER. The one having the smallest variance is determined as the estimated MMO. Owing to space symmetric property, it generally introduces 8 possible solutions. Then, a mathematic method is presented to define the common characteristics of the magnetic signature in the 8 octants, which is able to identify the octant of unknown target based on detected Bi field. As a result, the unique MMO can be estimated. The experimental results show good estimation accuracy for the dipole orientation with average error of 3.5°. In particular, the algorithm is independent of changing CPA and velocity, which is demonstrated in simulation and experiment.","Magnetic moment,Magnetic anomaly signature,Estimation,"
"mining vessel tracking data for maritime domain applications","2016","The growing number of remote sensing systems and ship reporting technologies (e.g. Automatic Identification System, Long Range Identification and Tracking, radar tracking, Earth Observation) are generating an overwhelming amount of spatio-temporal and geographically distributed data related to vessels and their movements. Research on reliable data mining techniques has proven essential to the discovery of knowledge from such increasingly available information on ship traffic at sea. Data driven knowledge discovery has very recently demonstrated its value in fields that go beyond the original maritime safety and security remits of such data. They include, but are not limited to, fisheries management, maritime spatial planning, gridding ship emissions, mapping activities at sea, risk assessment of offshore platforms, and trade indicators. The extraction of useful information from maritime Big Data is thus a key element in providing operational authorities, policy-makers and scientists with supporting tools to understand what is happening at sea and improve maritime knowledge. This work will provide a survey of the recent JRC research activities relevant to automatic anomaly detection and knowledge discovery in the maritime domain.

"augmented ship tracking under occlusion conditions from maritime surveillance videos","2020","Ship tracking provides crucial on-site microscopic kinematic traffic information which benefits maritime traffic flow analysis, ship safety enhancement, traffic control, etc., and thus has attracted considerable research attentions in the maritime surveillance community. Conventional ship tracking methods yield satisfied results by exploring distinct visual ship features in maritime images, which may fail when the target ship is partially or fully sheltered by obstacles (e.g., ships, waves, etc.) in maritime videos. To overcome the difficulty, we propose an augmented ship tracking framework via the kernelized correlation filter (KCF) and curve fitting algorithm. First, the KCF model is introduced to track ships in the consecutive maritime images and obtain raw ship trajectory dataset. Second, the data anomaly detection and rectification procedure are implemented to rectify the contaminated ship positions. For the purpose of performance evaluation, we implement the proposed framework and another three popular ship tracking models on the four typical ship occlusion videos. The experimental results show that our proposed framework successfully tracks ships in maritime video clips with high accuracy (i.e., the average root mean square error (RMSE), root mean square percentage error (RMSPE), mean absolute deviation (MAD) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) are less than 10), which significantly outperforms the other popular ship trackers.","Smart ship,maritime surveillance videos,Marine vehicles,Feature extraction,maritime traffic flow analysis,augmented ship tracking,ship trajectory dataset,on-site microscopic kinematic traffic information,visual ship features,Videos,kernelized correlation filter,object tracking,ships,marine safety,marine engineering,Target tracking,object detection,feature extraction,maritime images,Correlation,curve fitting algorithm,image filtering,video signal processing,Training,curve fitting,ship occlusion videos,data anomaly detection,Visualization,traffic control,ship occlusion,traffic engineering computing,ship safety enhancement,video surveillance,visual ship tracking,"
"fuzzy/human risk analysis for maritime situational awareness and decision support","2017","Human computation (HC) is an active research field in which people play a notable role as computational elements in an automated system with the aim of arriving at a truly symbiotic human-computer interaction. Situational awareness (SA) and decision support systems (DSSs) are two domains where human computation is rapidly advancing, with the latter arising as an invaluable vehicle to achieve the former. Fuzzy systems and fuzzy logic are two commonly employed tools in these domains due to their inherent capabilities of representing and processing vague and imprecise information while conveying the analysis results in an interpretable fashion. In this paper, we elaborate on the human computation aspects of risk analysis within SA and DSS conducted with the aid of fuzzy sets. The study makes the following contributions: (1) we argue that risk analysis must be a highly automated yet still human-centric endeavour and highlight four manners in which the human component provides value to the underlying data/information fusion processes; (2) we illustrate this fuzzy/human risk analysis methodology through a multi-modular Risk Management Framework (RMF) architecture and its application to the maritime domain, particularly in hard-soft data fusion, automated response generation to maritime incidents, port anomaly filtering and dynamic risk management triggered by contextual knowledge and (3) the framework under discussion can be extrapolated to other domains with negligible effort.","decision support systems,RMF,HC,Risk management,Hidden Markov models,human computer interaction,Human computer interaction,fuzzy logic,maritime situational awareness,marine engineering,risk management,human computation,Spread spectrum communication,Decision support systems,human risk analysis,DSS,risk management framework,fuzzy systems,Data mining,Fuzzy risk analysis,"
"a four year (2007–2010) analysis of long-lasting deep convective systems in the mediterranean basin","2013","Long-lasting, deep convective systems (DCS) occurring in the Mediterranean basin have been investigated for the 2007–2010years using geostationary Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) satellite data, supported by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) analyses and severe weather reports recorded by the European Severe Weather Database (ESWD). The spatial and seasonal variability of DCS occurrence have been investigated, as well as the most favourable synoptic precursors for their initiation. The analysis has shown the existence of some preferential areas of DCS genesis, mainly located in the western (i.e., around Balearic Islands) and central (i.e., Ionic and Tyrrhenian seas) Mediterranean, where these systems develop and grow preferentially in fall (i.e., September and October). The analysis of a selected set of Synoptic Precursors (SPs) has shown how the totality of the identified cases has occurred downstream a mid-tropospheric (500hPa) disturbance (trough or cut-off) within a southerly flow, with high values of θe (at 850hPa) and precipitable water. Moreover, the approaching of an upper level tropopause dynamical anomaly coupled with a local maximum of upper and low level horizontal wind speed, seems to play a very important role in triggering convection. Finally, a careful crosscheck of the detected cases with the ESWD reports has allowed to investigate the severity of these systems, as they often affect population and produce significant damages. This study has to be considered a necessary step towards the development of a larger climatologic database of long-lasting, deep convective events occurring in the Mediterranean sea, as well as the definition of a specific conceptual model based on synoptic precursors, having the long-term issue of setting up an objective procedure to support regional meteorological services in early decisions and accurate nowcasting.","Severe weather reports,Synoptic precursors,Deep convective systems,Mediterranean basin,Satellite imagery,"

"machine learning-assisted anomaly detection in maritime navigation using ais data","2020","The automatic identification system (AIS) reports vessels' static and dynamic information, which are essential for maritime traffic situation awareness. However, AIS transponders can be switched off to hide suspicious activities, such as illegal fishing, or piracy. Therefore, this paper uses real world AIS data to analyze the possibility of successful detection of various anomalies in the maritime domain. We propose a multi-class artificial neural network (ANN)-based anomaly detection framework to classify intentional and non-intentional AIS on-off switching anomalies. The multi-class anomaly framework captures AIS message dropouts due to various reasons, e.g., channel effects or intentional one for carrying illegal activities. We extract position, speed, course and timing information from real world AIS data, and use them to train a 2-class (normal and anomaly) and a 3-class (normal, power outage and anomaly) anomaly detection models. Our results show that the models achieve around 99.9% overall accuracy, and are able to classify a test sample in the order of microseconds.","security of data,maritime traffic situation awareness,multiclass anomaly framework,pattern classification,multiclass artificial neural network,AIS message dropouts,neural nets,illegal fishing,learning (artificial intelligence),illegal activities,ships,automatic identification system,marine engineering,machine learning-assisted anomaly detection,maritime navigation,AIS transponders,"
"unsupervised maritime traffic pattern extraction from spatio-temporal data","2015","Maritime traffic pattern extraction is a fundamental and crucial factor for maritime surveillance and anomaly detection. Emerging technologies like Automatic Identification System (AIS) provides multi-dimensional data which is used to construct a maritime traffic model. In this paper, we propose a framework of maritime traffic pattern extraction from vessel AIS information, which learns a traffic pattern using an unsupervised technique, and can be applied on historical Automatic Identification System data. AIS data is a kind of spatio-temporal data that contains information of location data, as well as time stamps. In this way, traffic pattern is described by AIS data. Furthermore, we conduct a simulation experiment that extracts traffic pattern from the AIS data through the unsupervised technique. The proposed framework takes advantage of AIS data, which is a type of the spatiotemporal data that consists of vessel motion information, to perform the experiment. The result shows that the unsupervised framework converts useful information from raw AIS data to effective traffic pattern.

"framework for ship trajectory forecasting based on linear stationary models using automatic identification system","2022","Maritime surveillance is of utmost priority for a nation's security, and hence it's economy. For maritime awareness, coastal surveillance, and maritime activities in the Region of Interest (ROI) should be monitored. One of the ways to keep this in check is to restrain unwanted infiltration. Monitoring unwanted infiltration is feasible through vessel trajectory forecasting and anomaly detection in real time. Most solutions for trajectory predictions are available but require a huge amount of historical data, and high-power computing resources. Here, the requirement is developing a decision support framework consisting of both lite weight approaches for short-term predictions and deep learning-based techniques for long-term forecasting. This paper aims to find the suitability of Linear Stationary Models (LSM) like the Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average Model (ARIMA) for predicting and forecasting the Vessel Trajectory as means of lite weight short-term predictions. For this purpose, the Automatic Identification System (AIS) dataset of the U.S. West Coast is used. The significant effort was for data pre-processing to create a robust dataset for model training. An appropriate model after the model-selection process is used for trajectory forecasting. The model's accuracy is validated using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) performance indices for residual and forecast errors. A window generator model is integrated with the best-fitted ARIMA model for recursive real-time predictions, with varied sizes and visualization. The proposed time-series model provided a very high accuracy as the RMSE value for prediction and 48 hours forecast are 0.023 and 0.017, respectively.","Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average Model,Window Generator,Trajectory Forecast,Time Series Analysis,Automatic Identification System,Maritime Surveillance,"

"routeminer: mining ship routes from a massive maritime trajectories","2014","Mining trajectory data has been attracting significant interest in the last years. By analyzing trajectory data, we are able to discover the movement behavior and location-aware knowledge, and then develop many interesting applications such as movement behavior discovery, location prediction, traffic analysis, and so on. However, trajectory data mining is a challenge task because of the trajectory data is available with uncertainty. Furthermore, discovering the valuable knowledge from maritime trajectory is made even more difficult due to the maritime area is a free moving space. Unlike the vehicles' movements are constrained by road networks, there is no such a sea route for ships to follow in maritime area. A ship's movement may not exactly repeat the same trajectory even the ship has the similar movement behavior with others. In this work, Route Miner system provides a framework of ship route mining for maritime traffic analysis. Given a set of ship trajectories in a maritime area, Route Miner explore the movement behavior from those massive trajectories in a free moving space. Then, ship routes are detected based on those behavioral pattern. Finally, the system generates a set of ships routes to provide operators a better understanding from ship trajectory data. We conduct the experiments on real maritime trajectories to show the effectiveness of proposed Route Miner. In the future, Route Miner is going to serve as the photo type for exploring the solutions of the challenges those related to anomaly detection and traffic management in the maritime domain.","data mining,Vectors,movement behavior,anomaly detection,Marine vehicles,movement behavior discovery,traffic management,ship trajectories,Trajectory Data Mining,mining ship routes,ship route mining,Ship Route Mining,marine systems,maritime trajectories,Vehicles,trajectory data analysis,route miner system,Maritime Trajectory,trajectory data mining,maritime domain,behavioral pattern,maritime traffic analysis,Roads,location prediction,Trajectory,massive maritime trajectories,Uncertainty,road networks,Data mining,maritime area,location-aware knowledge,"

We have reconstructed past climate changes in subarctic west-central Canada. Stable carbon and oxygen isotope ratios (δ13C, δ18O) were derived from a single Sphagnum fuscum plant component; α-cellulose isolated from stems. Periods of warmer and cooler conditions identified in this region, described in terms of a “Mediaeval Climatic Anomaly” and “Little Ice Age” were registered in the temperature reconstruction based on the δ13C record. Some conclusions could be drawn about wet/dry shifts during the same time interval from the δ18O record, humification indices and the macrofossil analysis. The results were compared with other proxy data from the vicinity of the study area.

To utilize aforementioned features available in Automatic information system (AIS), we formulate the problem in a novel way, by detecting anomalies in a set of directed graphs representing the movement pattern at each time interval.

These capabilities contribute to higher-level fusion situational awareness and assessment objectives. They also provide essential elements for automated scene understanding to shift operator focus from sensor monitoring and activity detection to assessment and response. Our learning algorithms learn behavioral patterns at a variety of conceptual, spatial, and temporal levels to reduce a massive amount of track data to a rich set of information regarding their field of regard that supports decision-making and timely response initiation. Continuous incremental learning enables the models of normal behavior to adapt well to evolving situations while maintaining high levels of performance. Deviations from normalcy result in reports being published directly to operator displays or to other reasoning components within a larger system. Deviation tolerance levels are user settable during system operation to tune alerting sensitivity. Operator (or other system component) responses to anomaly alerts can be fed back into the algorithms to further enhance and refine learned models. These algorithms have been successfully demonstrated to learn vessel behaviors across the maritime domain and to learn vehicle and dismount behavior in land-based settings.","Motion detection,Pattern analysis,Decision making,Algorithm design and analysis,Layout,Motion analysis,Computerized monitoring,Displays,Vehicles,Tracking,"

In order to support the operator while monitoring such systems, the identification of anomalous vessels or situations that might need further investigation may reduce the operator's cognitive load. While it is worth acknowledging that many existing mining applications support identification of anomalous behavior, autonomous anomaly detection systems are rarely used in the real world, since the detection of anomalous behavior is normally not a well-defined problem and therefore, human expert knowledge is needed. This calls for the development of interaction components that can support the user in the detection process. In order to support the comprehension of the knowledge embedded in the system, we propose an interactive way of visualizing expert rules and normal behavioral models built from the data.

The 11-year and 23-year overlapping means of global (δtg) as well as northern (δtn) and southern (δts) hemispheric SST anomalies reveal significant positive correlation with both Rz and aa indices. Rz, aa and δtg depict a similar trend in their long-term variation and both seem to be on increase after attaining a minimum in the early 20th century (∼1905).

"maritime vessel route extraction and automatic information system (ais) spoofing detection","2021","Automated Identification System (AIS) comprises of a global real-time network of maritime vessels, transmitters, and satellite or ground-station receivers, which are used to track and record time-stamped static (vessel-id, type, etc.) and dynamic (location, course, speed, etc.) information of all maritime vessels. Traditionally, this data feed has been used by vessel traffic services to avoid vessel collisions, however increasingly, marine researchers and data scientists have shown interest in developing algorithms on historical AIS data-dumps with diverse objectives such as estimating trends in global ocean-currents, maritime logistical planning, fishing fleet monitoring and enhancing maritime security. This paper aims to propose a novel shipping-route extraction algorithm to process historical AIS data (running into tens of gigabytes of daily data, from more than a hundred thousand maritime vessels), to effectively characterize global shipping route behaviour and capture its seasonal trends. This is done by formulating a sigmoid based turning waypoint identification, which does not solely depend on the change in the course of a vessel, derived from AIS message. The AIS data is further processed to excerpt the vesselâ€™s distance from the nearest port and nearest shore with resolution of about 1 km, which forms a handy metric for the identification of suspicious ports. Several other use cases are also explored, which include detecting various anomalies in individual vessel behaviour such as intentional or unintentional switching off AIS transmission, shipping-lane deviations, spoofing transmission messages. To tackle spoofing anomaly, various spoofing identification methods are discussed. A region-based spoofing identification algorithm is developed to identify spoofing points under multiple categories using a clustering algorithm.

"use of landsat data to track historical water quality changes in florida keys marine environments","2014","Satellite remote sensing has shown the advantage of water quality assessment at synoptic scales in coastal regions, yet modern sensors such as SeaWiFS or MODIS did not start until the late 1990s. For non-interrupted observations, only the Landsat series have the potential to detect major water quality events since the 1980s. However, such ability is hindered by the unknown data quality or consistency through time. Here, using the Florida Keys as a case study, we demonstrate an approach to identify historical water quality events through improved atmospheric correction of Landsat data and cross-validation with concurrent MODIS data. After aggregation of the Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) 30-m pixels to 240-m pixels (to increase the signal-to-noise ratio), a MODIS-like atmospheric correction approach using the Landsat shortwave-infrared (SWIR) bands was developed and applied to the entire Landsat-5 TM data series between 1985 and 2010. Remote sensing reflectance (RRS) anomalies from Landsat (2 standard deviations from a pixel-specific monthly climatology) were found to detect MODIS RRS anomalies with over 90% accuracy for all three bands for the same period of 2002–2010. Extending this analysis for the entire Landsat-5 time-series revealed RRS anomaly events in the 1980s and 1990s, some of which are corroborated by known ecosystem changes due in part to changes in local freshwater flow. Indeed, TM RRS anomalies were shown to be useful in detecting shifts in seagrass density, turbidity increases, black water events, and phytoplankton blooms. These findings have large implications for ongoing and future water quality assessment in the Florida Keys as well as in many other coastal regions.","Remote sensing,Water quality,Seagrass,Atmospheric correction,"

"research on detection mechanism of vessel abnormal behavior based on immune genetic spectral clustering algorithm","2022","Maritime transport accounts for over 90% of global trade, and maritime safety has been confirmed as a vital issue of maritime transport. Accordingly, vessel traffic service system (VTS) is capable of assisting the maritime department to complete real-time supervision of a certain water area and increasing the efficiency of water supervision. However, the VTS system has low effectiveness in vessel anomaly detection and supervision, thus resulting in regulatory blind spot in the VTS system. In this study, a vessel trajectory anomaly detection mechanism is developed using the immune genetic spectral clustering method. Moreover, the contour coefficient of scatter clustering is accurately analyzed, and the clustering center is optimized using the adopted method. On that basis, different abnormal features can be detected, and abnormal detection accuracy can be increased. In this study, the vessel trajectory anomaly detection model is built in accordance with the set sliding window and abnormal threshold parameters of vessel trajectory characteristics. The AIS data of Lianyungang to Qingdao port from March 2021 are selected for experimental analysis. The results suggest that the proposed method outperforms the conventional method in the detection accuracy and the false alarm rate, it facilitates the intelligent and automatic management of vessels by the VTS system.","Immune genetic,Abnormal behavior detection,Automatic identification system (AIS),Spectral clustering,Duplicato-degree measurement,Intelligent vessel supervision,"

"high fidelity digital twin-based anomaly detection and localization for smart water grid operation management","2023","Smart Water Grid (SWG) plays a critical role in sustaining cities economic and social development, but challenges remain in fully realizing the benefits of SWG. While Digital twin (DT) has been discussed in some literature for possible SWG applications, there has been limited, or no technical framework developed to facilitate SWG operation and management. In this paper, a generic framework is developed for constructing SWG high fidelity Digital Twin (DT) by integrating digital thread with various digital models for visualization, data-driven analysis, physics-based simulations, and decision-making support. Both the physics-based models and data-driven models are trained/retrained and calibrated/re-calibrated respectively by using the data collected with the sensors installed throughout a SWG. The information derived from the SWG DT can be diagnostic, predictive, and prescriptive to significantly augment users’ intelligence for improving SWG operation and management. One important application of digital twin augmented intelligence is illustrated to timely detect and localize anomaly events, which may include, but not be limited to, pipe bursts and unauthorized water usages. The solution is tested on the selected areas in Singapore to construct the ever-green DT by calibrating and recalibrating the models for near real-time SWG operation management. The case study was conducted for three supply zones with the total pipeline length of more than 1000 km and 40 weeks of monitoring data, collected by 89 pressure monitoring stations and 8 flow meters at inlets and boundary. More than 3300 data-driven models are trained for optimizing the model performance to achieve accuracy of greater than 80% F1 score for detecting anomaly events, which are subsequently localized within 400 m with 2–3 days lead time.","Data analytics,Anomaly localization,Smart water grid,Anomaly detection,Machine learning,Digital twin,"
"discovering themes and trends in transportation research using topic modeling","2017","Transportation research is a key area in both science and engineering. In this paper, we present an empirical analysis of 17,163 articles published in 22 leading transportation journals from 1990 to 2015. We apply a latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model on article abstracts to infer 50 key topics. We show that those characterized topics are both representative and meaningful, mostly corresponding to established sub-fields in transportation research. These identified fields reveal a research landscape for transportation. Based on the results of LDA, we quantify the similarity of journals and countries/regions in terms of their aggregated topic distributions. By measuring the variation of topic distributions over time, we find some general research trends, such as topics on sustainability, travel behavior and non-motorized mobility are becoming increasingly popular over time. We also carry out this temporal analysis for each journal, observing a high degree of consistency for most journals. However, some interesting anomaly, such as special issues on particular topics, are detected from temporal variation as well. By quantifying the temporal trends at the country/region level, we find that countries/regions display clearly distinguishable patterns, suggesting that research communities in different regions tend to focus on different sub-fields. Our results could benefit different parties in the academic community—including researchers, journal editors and funding agencies—in terms of identifying promising research topics/projects, seeking for candidate journals for a submission, and realigning focus for journal development.","Research policy,Topic modeling,Transportation research,Publication data,"

"on the effectiveness of ai-assisted anomaly detection methods in maritime navigation","2020","The automatic identification system (AIS) has become an essential tool for maritime security. Nevertheless, how to effectively use the static and dynamic voyage information of the AIS data in maritime traffic situation awareness is still a challenge. This paper presents a comparative study of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques on their effectiveness in dealing with various anomalies in maritime domain using the AIS data. The AIS on-off switching (OOS) anomaly is critical in maritime security, since AIS technology is susceptible to manipulation and it can be switched on and off to hide illegal activities. Thus, we try to detect and distinguish between intentional and non-intentional AIS OOS anomalies through our AI -assisted anomaly detection framework. We use AIS data, in particular positional and navigational status of vessels, to study the effectiveness of seven AI techniques, such as artificial neural network, support vector machine, logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, decision tree, random forest and naive Bayes, in detecting the AIS OOS anomalies. Our experimental results show that ANN and SVM are the most suitable techniques in detecting the AIS OOS anomalies with 99.9% accuracy. Interestingly, the ANN model outperforms others when trained with a balanced (i.e., same order of samples per class) dataset, and SVM, on the other hand, is suitable when training dataset is unbalanced.","maritime traffic situation awareness,AI-assisted anomaly detection,decision trees,Support vector machines,logistic regression,Anomaly detection,static voyage information,random forests,ANN,marine navigation,Feature extraction,security of data,maritime security,k-nearest neighbors,regression analysis,AIS technology,naive Bayes,neural nets,naive Bayes methods,automatic identification system,marine safety,marine engineering,support vector machines,maritime navigation,dynamic voyage information,maritime domain,random forest,SVM,Artificial intelligence,AIS on-off switching anomaly,nearest neighbour methods,artificial neural network,Training,Trajectory,support vector machine,nonintentional AIS OOS anomalies,Navigation,artificial intelligence,decision tree,AIS data,"

A distinction between anomalies and measurement outliers is made and a method to detect and distinguish between the two is proposed.

"design of a decision support system to achieve condition-based maintenance in ship machinery systems","2023","A decision support system is proposed for the condition-based maintenance of ship machinery systems based on the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) approach. A case study is conducted for a container ship's main diesel engine. Within the scope of the methodology, the main engine power is predicted based on exhaust gas outlet temperatures of cylinders and the main engine shaft RPM. In this regard, firstly, two different strategies such as the creation of the cylinder-basis model and the development of the overall system model are developed to determine the ANFIS model structure for the analysis. Then, comparative analyses are carried out to select a suitable ANFIS structure and its specific membership functions. In addition, the estimation process is also performed by the artificial neural network (ANN) model, and its results are compared with the findings of the best ANFIS structure. The success of the constructed models is evaluated by some error metrics. The overall ANFIS model with 5 membership functions is determined as the best approach by scores of 0.9806 for R2, 1.6588 MW for RMSE, and 3.2703 for MAPE. As a result of the estimation procedure, a decision support system to assist marine operators in maintenance operations is developed. The proposed strategy can be applied to different types of systems in the ship engine room such as the fuel oil system and can be improved by including more parameters obtained from the system's significant points in the analysis.","Anomaly detection,Ship machinery system,ANN,Condition-based maintenance,Maintenance,ANFIS,"
"relating anomalous large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns to temperature and precipitation anomalies in the east asian monsoon region","2020","The anomalous large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns concerned with surface air temperature and precipitation anomalies within East Asian Monsoon region for winter and summer months from 1979 to 2017 are analyzed by employing the self-organizing map (SOM) neural network. The asymmetric 3 × 4 SOM neural network is firstly constructed with the geopotential height anomalies at 500-hPa level as the only input variable. Then 12 characteristic anomalous large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns (nodes) are identified. The composites of temperature and precipitation anomalies as well as vertical wind anomalies at 500-hPa level assigned to each node are generated and visualized. The spatial distributions of anomalous geopotential height (anticyclones or cyclones) are highly consistent with that of surface air temperature anomalies in both winter and summer. Most precipitation extremes in winter are attributed to the joint effect of the horizontal and vertical atmospheric motions, while strong air convection is prone to inducing extreme precipitation events in summer. Based on the SOM classification, the differences of atmospheric circulations, temperature and precipitation anomalies have also been partly identified in strong and weak phases of East Asia Monsoon.","Temperature and precipitation anomalies,Self-organizing map,East Asian Monsoon,Atmospheric circulation patterns,"

The major data source for such analysis is Automatic Identification System (AIS), which publishes data related to movement of the ship while cruising. AIS broadcasts information including type of ship, identity number, state, destination, estimated time of arrival (ETA), location, speed, direction, and cargo. In this paper, we focus on extracting a variety of trajectory patterns for maritime vessels. The first group of analysis we focus on is arrival port, arrival time, and next position prediction on AIS messages, which are useful to aid maritime operators. We propose three different approaches for the prediction of marine vessel movement. As the second type of analysis, anomaly detection on marine vessel trajectory is studied.

"maritime vessel traffic modeling in the context of concept drift","2017","Maritime traffic modeling serves the purpose of extracting human-readable information and discovering knowledge in the otherwise illegible mass of traffic data. The goal of this study is to examine the presence and character of fluctuations in maritime traffic patterns. The main objective is to identify such fluctuations and capture them in terms of a concept drift, i.e., unforeseen shifts in statistical properties of the modeled target occurring over time. The empirical study is based on a collection of AIS vessel tracking data, spanning over a year. The scope of the study limits the AIS data area to the Baltic region (9-31°E, 53-66°N), which experiences some of the most dense maritime traffic in the world. The investigations employ a novel maritime traffic modeling method based on the potential fields concept, adapted for this study to facilitate the examination of concept drift. The concept drift is made apparent in course of the statistical and visual analysis of the experimental results. This study shows a number of particular cases, in which the maritime traffic is affected by concept drifts of varying extent and character. The visual representations of the traffic models make shifts in the traffic patterns apparent and comprehensible to human eye. Based on the experimental outcomes, the robustness of the modeling method against concept drift in traffic is discussed and improvements are proposed. The outcomes provide insights into regularly reoccurring drifts and irregularities within the traffic data itself that may serve to further optimize the modeling method, and – in turn – the performance of detection based on it.","maritime traffic,concept drift,traffic modeling,anomaly detection,"
"outlier detection approach for discovering anomalous maritime profiles","2023","Maritime authorities play a key role in ensuring the safety and security of shipping lanes and ports. The port state control mechanism enables these authorities to physically verify suspect vessels (e.g., involved in smuggling or piracy events), but choosing the most relevant vessels to be inspected represents a challenging task. This decision can be enhanced by AI-powered systems that analyse large amounts of data, identify patterns and report all observed discrepancies. This paper presents a statistical analysis on the temporal durations of four types of naval statuses: sailing, docked in port, waiting at anchor and not transmitting AIS data. These durations were extracted from the historical activity of different classes of vessels that passed the Black Sea region (Romanian Exclusive Economic Zone) in 2022. Probability density functions were built for these vessels and all statuses' durations were fitted into known parametric distributions.

We focus in particular on the problem of detecting subtle anomalies in a behaviourally heterogeneous surveillance scene. To reach this goal we implement a novel unsupervised context-aware process. We propose and evaluate a method of utilising social context and scene context to improve behaviour analysis. We find that in a crowded scene the application of Mutual Information based social context permits the ability to prevent self-justifying groups and propagate anomalies in a social network, granting a greater anomaly detection capability. Scene context uniformly improves the detection of anomalies in both datasets. The strength of our contextual features is demonstrated by the detection of subtly abnormal behaviours, which otherwise remain indistinguishable from normal behaviour.","Behaviour analysis,Context,Visual surveillance,Security,"

First, the categories of abnormal ship behavior and data sources of DASB are concretely introduced, and the process of data-driven DASB combined with expert knowledge are described. Second, we conduct systematic disciplinary knowledge maps in the field of DASB, which identify evolution, hotspots and emerging trends. In this manner, data-driven methods for DASB were categorized into six types, including multisource data fusion approaches, statistical analysis approaches, traditional intelligent algorithmic approaches, deep learning approaches, knowledge-based and data-driven integrating approaches and computing power, and provide an overview of them.

"comparison of meteorological and satellite-based drought indices as yield predictors of spanish cereals","2019","In the context of global warming, as drought episodes become increasingly frequent, it is crucial to accurately measure the impacts of droughts on the overall performance of agrosystems. This study aims to compare the effectiveness of meteorological drought indices against satellite-based agronomical drought indices as crop yield explanatory factors in statistical models calibrated at a local scale. The analysis is conducted in Spain using a spatially detailed, 12-year (2003–2015) dataset on crop yields, including different types of cereals. Yields and drought indices were spatially aggregated at the agricultural district level. The Standardised Precipitation Index (SPI), computed at different temporal aggregation levels, and two satellite-based drought indices, the Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) and the Temperature Condition Index (TCI), were used to characterise the dynamics of drought severity conditions in the study area. Models resting on satellite-based indices showed higher performance in explaining yield levels as well as yield anomalies for all the crops evaluated. In particular, VCI/TCI models of winter wheat and barley were able to explain 70% and 40% of annual crop yield level and crop yield anomaly variability, respectively. We also observed gains in explanatory power when models for climate zones (instead of models at the national scale) were considered. All the results were cross-validated on subsamples of the whole dataset and on models fitted to individual agricultural districts and their predictive accuracy was assessed with a real-time forecasting exercise. Results from this study highlight the potential for including satellite-based drought indices in agricultural decision support systems (e.g. agricultural drought early warning systems, crop yield forecasting models or water resource management tools) complementing meteorological drought indices derived from precipitation grids.","NDVI,ESYRCE,Cereal yields,LST,Agricultural drought,InfoSequia,"
"scalable anomaly-based intrusion detection for secure internet of things using generative adversarial networks in fog environment","2023","The data generated exponentially by a massive number of devices in the Internet of Things (IoT) are extremely high-dimensional, large-scale, non-labeled, which poses great challenges to timely analysis and effective decision making for anomaly detection in IoT. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised deep learning method to identify anomalies against IoT networks, which exploits Bidirectional Generative Adversarial Networks (BiGAN) to build model on normal IoT data. The model introduces Wasserstein distance to capture and learn the distribution of high-dimensional raw data and focuses on latent representations using an auxiliary classifier. A cycle consistency connection between data is designed to prevent information loss that helps to reduce false positive rate. The model detects outliers by utilizing reconstruction error in feature space. Another challenge facing the current anomaly detection solutions is their limited scalability, which restricts capability in handling big IoT data. This issue is resolved by deploying and jointly training the proposed method in a fog computing environment. The anomaly-based intrusion detection can be scalable by leveraging the flexibility of fog computing, which contributes to supporting efficient detection. Experimental results on two recent datasets (i.e., UNSW-NB15 and CIC-IDS2017) validate that the proposed method achieves 4% increase in accuracy and 4% reduction in false alarm rate than the state-of-the-art methods while keeping computational efficiency.","Intrusion detection,Anomaly detection,Internet of Things,Generative adversarial networks,Fog computing,"
"primary drivers of multidecadal spatial and temporal patterns of shoreline change derived from optical satellite imagery","2022","Understanding and predicting shoreline change along sandy coasts requires continuous (in both time and space) long-term (decades) shoreline data at good spatial (e.g. 100 s of metres) and temporal (e.g. months) resolution. Publicly available satellite imagery can now provide such time series. However, satellite-derived shorelines (SDS) are associated with uncertainties, particularly at high-energy meso-macrotidal coasts, which challenge the assessment of long-term trends and interannual variability. In this paper we address the 1984–2020 time- and space-evolution of 269 km of high-energy meso-macrotidal sandy coast in southwest France using uncertain (no tide and runup correction) SDS data. The shoreline trends are validated with field data collected over the period 2008–2019. Over 1984–2020, the shoreline eroded by 0.55 m/yr with maximum erosion (accretion) reaching 15.61 m/yr (6.94 m/yr), with the largest changes observed along coasts adjacent to the inlet and estuary mouths. We show that, away from the presence of ebb-tide deltas and swash bars affecting offshore wave transformation and nearshore circulation, the long-term shoreline trend is well explained by the gradients in longshore drift computed from a regional wave hindcast and an empirical longshore transport formula. By averaging the yearly SDS along the entire coastline, we find that interannual shoreline variability is well correlated with the winter West Europe Pressure Anomaly (WEPA), which outscores the other conventional teleconnection pattern indices. WEPA even explains >80 % of the space-averaged shoreline variability over the recent period 2014–2020 when more and higher quality satellite images are available. A more local assessment of the links between climate indices and shoreline response shows that correlation with all climate indices dramatically drops downdrift of the large-scale estuary mouths and inlets. This suggests that along this 10–20 km stretch of downdrift coast, shoreline response is controlled factors internal to the estuary mouth/inlet system. The rest of the coast is mostly controlled by factors external to the system, which are primarily the variability in winter-mean wave height correlated to winter WEPA index. Overall, we demonstrate that an adapted space-averaging of uncorrected (noisy) SDS dataset can allow addressing the time- and space variability of shoreline change and their primary drivers including large-scale climate patterns of atmospheric variability. We also advocate that such SDS analysis can be performed along any coastline in the world in order to guide future model development and application.","Internal and external controls,Chronic erosion,Inlet and estuary mouth,Wave climate indices,Interannual shoreline variability,"

"anomaly detection in maritime data based on geometrical analysis of trajectories","2015","Anomaly detection is an important use of the Automatic Identification Systems (AIS), because it offers support to users to evaluate if a vessel is in trouble or causing trouble. For instance, it can be used to detect if a ship is doing something that may cause an accident or if it has changed its route to avoid bad weather condition. In this work, a new method for finding anomalies in the ships' movements is proposed. The method analyzes the trajectory of ships from a geometrical perspective. The trajectory of the ship is compared with a near-optimal path that is generated by a graph search algorithm. The proposed method extracts some scale-invariant features from the real trajectory and also from the optimal movement pattern, and it compares the two sets of features to generate an abnormality score. The method is unsupervised and it does not require training. Instead of labeling the trajectories as normal/abnormal it calculates a score value that denotes the extent of abnormality. The scoring scheme provides a ranking system in which the user can sort the trajectories based on their abnormality score. This is useful when dealing with large number of trajectories and the user wants to picks the most abnormal cases. For the evaluation, the method was run on three months data of North Pacific Ocean and score values were generated. Among the entire dataset, 100 randomly chosen trajectories were labeled by an expert. After applying a threshold on the score value, the proposed method had 94% accuracy.","maritime data,Clustering algorithms,randomly chosen trajectories,optimal movement pattern,anomaly detection,North Pacific Ocean,Marine vehicles,abnormality score,Mathematical model,Feature extraction,geometrical trajectories analysis,scale-invariant features,ships,marine engineering,bad weather condition,AIS,Oceans,near-optimal path,ship trajectory,ship movements,graph theory,graph search algorithm,Joining processes,score values,search problems,Trajectory,automatic identification systems,"

"on the theory of intensity distributions of tornadoes and other low pressure systems","2009","Approaching from a theoretical point of view, this work presents a theory which unifies intensity distributions of different low pressure systems, based on an energy of displacement. Resulting from a generalized Boltzmann distribution, the expression of this energy of displacement is obtained by radial integration over the forces which are in balance with the pressure gradient force in the horizontal equation of motion. A scale analysis helps to find out which balance of forces prevail. According to the prevailing balances, the expression of the energy of displacement differs for various depressions. Investigating the system at the moment of maximum intensity, the energy of displacement can be interpreted as the work that has to be done to generate and finally eliminate the pressure anomaly, respectively. By choosing the appropriate balance of forces, number–intensity (energy of displacement) distributions show exponential behavior with the same decay rate β for tornadoes and cyclones, if tropical and extra-tropical cyclones are investigated together. The decay rate is related to a characteristic (universal) scale of the energy of displacement which has approximately the value Eu=β−1≈1000 m2s−2. In consequence, while the different balances of forces cause the scales of velocity, the energy of displacement scale seems to be universal for all low pressure systems. Additionally, if intensity is expressed as lifetime minimum pressure, the number–intensity (pressure) distributions should be power law distributed. Moreover, this work points out that the choice of the physical quantity which represents the intensity is important concerning the behavior of intensity distributions. Various expressions of the intensity like velocity, kinetic energy, energy of displacement and pressure are possible, but lead to different behavior of the distributions.","Intensity distributions,Cyclones,Exponential behavior,Universal scale of energy of displacement,Tornadoes,Power law,"
"permeability and voids influence on the thermal signal, as inferred by multitemporal uav-based infrared and visible images","2020","This work presents for the first time associated thermal anomalies and deformations over subsurface cavities/voids located within two harbour quays in Le Havre Harbourg, Normandy, France. An U.A.V. (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) was used to acquire visible and thermal images over a diurnal cycle (from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m.). The visible images were processed to realize an altimetric model of the platforms by mean of the photogrammetric method, while the thermal infrared (TIR) images were used to study the evolution of their surface temperatures. The obtained 3D model shows the location of five topographic depressions on both quays. The analysis of the evolution of the surface thermal field leads to the detection of cold thermal anomalies that are (1) not correlated to surface properties, and (2) spatially associated to the flanks of the five topographic depressions. Using a 2D conductive-radiative model, we show that these anomalies are not directly due to the thermally insulating effect of an air-filled area. Finally, we conclude that preferential infiltration and subsequent evaporation in the micro-fracturation present within the flanks of the depressions may be responsible for the strong cooling of these zones.","Thermal infrared,Photogrammetry,Remote Sensing,infiltration,Subsurface cavity,Natural hazards,UAV,"
"image-consistent detection of road anomalies as unpredictable patches","2023","We propose a novel method for anomaly detection primarily aiming at autonomous driving. The design of the method, called DaCUP (Detection of anomalies as Consistent Unpredictable Patches), is based on two general properties of anomalous objects: an anomaly is (i) not from a class that could be modelled and (ii) it is not similar (in appearance) to non-anomalous objects in the image. To this end, we propose a novel embedding bottleneck in an auto-encoder like architecture that enables modelling of a diverse, multi-modal known class appearance (e.g. road). Secondly, we introduce novel image-conditioned distance features that allow known class identification in a nearest-neighbour manner on-the-fly, greatly increasing its ability to distinguish true and false positives. Lastly, an inpainting module is utilized to model the uniqueness of detected anomalies and significantly reduce false positives by filtering regions that are similar, thus reconstructable from their neighbourhood. We demonstrate that filtering of regions based on their similarity to neighbour regions, using e.g. an inpainting module, is general and can be used with other methods for reduction of false positives. The proposed method is evaluated on several publicly available datasets for road anomaly detection and on a maritime benchmark for obstacle avoidance. The method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both tasks with the same hyper-parameters with no domain specific design.","Benchmark testing,anomalous objects,road anomaly detection,Feature extraction,detection of anomalies as consistent unpredictable patches,Design methodology,Filtering,nearest-neighbour manner,nonanomalous objects,object detection,feature extraction,multimodal known class appearance,inpainting module,autonomous driving,domain specific design,nearest neighbour methods,Roads,image-consistent detection,mobile robots,image restoration,DaCUP,Task analysis,auto-encoder,Algorithms: Image recognition and understanding (object detection,obstacle avoidance,Computer vision,road vehicles,categorization,image-conditioned distance features,class identification,segmentation),"
"continuous monitoring of land disturbance based on landsat time series","2020","We developed a new algorithm for COntinuous monitoring of Land Disturbance (COLD) using Landsat time series. COLD can detect many kinds of land disturbance continuously as new images are collected and provide historical land disturbance maps retrospectively. To better detect land disturbance, we tested different kinds of input data and explored many time series analysis techniques. We have several major observations as follows. First, time series of surface reflectance provides much better detection results than time series of Top-Of-Atmosphere (TOA) reflectance, and with some adjustments to the temporal density, time series from Landsat Analysis Ready Data (ARD) is better than it is from the same Landsat scene. Second, the combined use of spectral bands is always better than using a single spectral band or index, and if all the essential spectral bands have been employed, the inclusion of other indices does not further improve the algorithm performance. Third, the remaining outliers in the time series can be removed based on their deviation from model predicted values based on probability-based thresholds derived from normal or chi-squared distributions. Fourth, model initialization is pivotal for monitoring land disturbance, and a good initialization stability test can influence algorithm performance substantially. Fifth, time series model estimation with eight coefficients model, updated for every single observation, based on all available clear observations achieves the best result. Sixth, a change probability of 0.99 (chi-squared distribution) with six consecutive anomaly observations and a mean included angle < 45° to confirm a change provide the best results, and the combined use of temporally-adjusted Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and minimum RMSE is recommended. Finally, spectral changes (or “breaks”) contributed from vegetation regrowth should be excluded from land disturbance maps. The COLD algorithm was developed and calibrated based on all these lessons learned above. The accuracy assessment shows that COLD results were accurate for detecting land disturbance, with an omission error of 27% and a commission error of 28%.","Landsat,Time series,COLD,Change detection,Near real-time,Land disturbance,"
"graph signal variation detection: a novel approach for identifying and reconstructing ship ais tangled trajectories","2023","Tangles are a common anomaly in Automatic Identification System (AIS) data, resulting from disorder in time sequences. They increase the spatial complexity of trajectories, making existing methods unable to fully recognize and process them. This will seriously affect the analysis of ship behavior. Furthermore, existing methods often directly remove after recognition, resulting in a significant loss of local information. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an algorithm called Graph Signal Variation Detection (GSVD) to recognize and reconstruct tangles. Initially, data preprocessing is conducted to remove redundant and stationary points. Then, construct the vertices and edges of the graph using indicators integrating AIS data features and ship trajectories, respectively. The tangled region is identified by calculating the total variation theory of the graph. The tangled region is reconstructed using the greedy heuristic, and the optimal reconstruction path is determined by combining total variation quantization. Finally, the GSVD is compared with four prevailing methods, through qualitative and quantitative analyses. The results demonstrate that the GSVD surpasses the other methods in terms of recognition accuracy, recall rates, and false alarm rates. Additionally, the GSVD can effectively reconstruct the tangle.","Total variation,Trajectory preprocessing,Graph signal,AIS data,Greedy algorithm,"
"vessel sailing patterns analysis from s-ais data dased on k-means clustering algorithm","2019","Automatic Identification System (AIS) provides abundant near real-time information of moving vessels in the sea of the whole world and has been widely used in the fields of vessel collision avoidance, Maritime Situation Awareness (MSA) and ocean surveillance. The development of satellite-based AIS further expands the range of AIS and enables a wide converge of AIS data collection, which solves the problem of lacking AIS data in high-seas. At the same time, AIS data provides a rich source for data mining for maritime traffic analysis. In this paper, a typical clustering algorithm called K-means is applied to deal with the Space-based AIS(S-AIS) data received by â€œTianTuo-3â€ satellite developed by National University of Defense Technology. We use Elbow Rule to determine the optimal number of clusters and calculate the normalized standard deviation of COG(Course Over Ground) and SOG(Speed Over Ground) of vessels in south Africa area as their features to conduct clustering.

"the geochemistry of gem opals as evidence of their origin","2008","Seventy-seven gem opals from ten countries were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) through a dilution process, in order to establish the nature of the impurities. The results are correlated to the mode of formation and physical properties and are instrumental in establishing the geographical origin of a gem opal. The geochemistry of an opal is shown to be dependant mostly on the host rock, at least for examples from Mexico and Brazil, even if modified by weathering processes. In order of decreasing concentration, the main impurities present are Al, Ca, Fe, K, Na, and Mg (more than 500 ppm). Other noticeable elements in lesser amounts are Ba, followed by Zr, Sr, Rb, U, and Pb. For the first time, geochemistry helps to discriminate some varieties of opals. The Ba content, as well as the chondrite-normalized REE pattern, are the keys to separating sedimentary opals (Ba>110 ppm, Eu and Ce anomalies) from volcanic opals (Ba<110 ppm, no Eu or Ce anomaly). The Ca content, and to a lesser extent that of Mg, Al, K and Nb, helps to distinguish gem opals from different volcanic environments. The limited range of concentrations for all elements in precious (play-of-color) compared to common opals, indicates that this variety must have very specific, or more restricted, conditions of formation. We tentatively interpreted the presence of impurities in terms of crystallochemistry, even if opal is a poorly crystallized or amorphous material. The main replacement is the substitution of Si4+ by Al3+ and Fe3+. The induced charge imbalance is compensated chiefly by Ca2+, Mg2+, Mn2+, Ba2+, K+, and Na+. In terms of origin of color, greater concentrations of iron induce darker colors (from yellow to “chocolate brown”). This element inhibits luminescence for concentrations above 1000 ppm, whereas already a low content in U (≤1 ppm) induces a green luminescence.","Opal,Trace element analysis,Chemical composition,Genesis,ICP-MS,"

"underwater archaeological investigation using ground penetrating radar: a case analysis of shanglinhu yue kiln sites (china)","2018","In this study we explored the possibility and effectiveness of applying ground penetrating radar (GPR) to investigate underwater cultural relics. Using this innovative technique, the remains of Yue kiln and anomalous objects buried beneath the lake or suspended in the water can now be fully studied. Although GPR has been widely used for imaging archaeological sites, skepticism remains over its use in underwater archaeology. Nevertheless, some scholars suggest that it is possible to use GPR to detect underwater remains, which has been further confirmed by the use of electrical parameter measurement (EPM) in Shanglinhu Lake. An experiment was performed by our team using antennas of different frequencies in a particular area of the lake. The results showed that the penetrability of the 100 MHz antenna was enough to examine the targets, while the 400 MHz antenna performed well in shallow water (depth <4 m) due to higher resolution. Hence, for our underwater investigation, we used both antennas for maximum coverage. We used a radargram as a topographic map which shows cross sections of the lake. Analysis of the Shanglinhu Lake data indicated that GPR is a superior tool for underwater archaeological investigation. Traditional methods including sonar, underwater cameras and salvage dives were used as supporting techniques in the study.","Underwater archaeological investigation,Ground penetrating radar,Yue kiln remains,"

"spatio-temporal analysis of aerosol optical depth using rotated empirical orthogonal function over the maritime continent from 2001 to 2020","2022","The deterioration in the annual air quality of the Maritime Continent (MC) is mainly caused by biomass burning haze (BBH) and the surrounding atmospheric conditions. This study aims to investigate the spatial and temporal variations of the aerosol optical depth (AOD) and its relationship with biomass burning and climate anomaly factors in the MC from 2001 to 2020. Using aerosol model reanalysis products from the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA-2), values of the aerosol optical depth (AOD) over the MC were collected and processed to obtain a better understanding of the characteristics of the aerosol loading over the MC. Using the varimax rotated empirical orthogonal function (REOF) approach, we assess the spatio-temporal distributions of the AOD over the MC from 2001 to 2020. The REOF maximized the variances explained for the primary modes and has shown clearer relationship between the spatiotemporal patterns of identified modes. The first three REOF modes of the AOD accounted for a total variance of 73.7%. The first mode (REOF1) explaining 35.8% is the main mode that represent fire burning that concentrated over the 0° latitude. REOF1 represents the emission from burning activities which primarily occurred in the Kalimantan and Sumatra based on their correlation with the total hotspots, which reach 0.73, which a certain extent of correlation with the climate anomalies, including El Niño, positive DM, and their coincidence. The second (REOF2) also explaining 35.8% represents the AOD distribution influenced by the biomass burning emission transported from the Indochina in the area to the north of 5°N which has an opposite mode with the general mode in MC except for Java area. Meanwhile, PC3 AOD has reduced to 2.2% in the rotation process and represent the influence of monsoon movement on the AOD level. In short, the study highlights spatial and temporal AOD distribution and the phenomena of burning mass and climate indices in the long-term MERRA reanalysis dataset to allow more understanding of the causal links of AOD in MC to the climate features.","Indian ocean dipole,Aerosol optical depth,El Niño southern oscillation,Maritime continent,"
"detection of aeromagnetic anomaly change associated with volcanic activity: an application of the generalized mis-tie control method","2009","Repeat aeromagnetic surveys may assist in mapping and monitoring long-term changes associated with volcanic activity. However, when dealing with repeat aeromagnetic survey data, the problem of how to extract the real change of magnetic anomalies from a limited set of observations arises, i.e. the problem of spatial aliasing. Recent development of the generalized mis-tie control method for aeromagnetic surveys flown at variable elevations enables us to statistically extract the errors from ambiguous noise sources. This technique can be applied to overcome the spatial alias effect when detecting magnetic anomaly changes between aeromagnetic surveys flown at different times. We successfully apply this technique to Asama Volcano, one of the active volcanoes in Japan, which erupted in 2004. Following the volcanic activity in 2005, we conducted a helicopter-borne aeromagnetic survey, which we compare here to the result from a previous survey flown in 1992. To discuss small changes in magnetic anomalies induced by volcanic activity, it is essential to estimate the accuracy of the reference and the repeat aeromagnetic measurements and the probable errors induced by data processing. In our case, the positioning inaccuracy of the 1992 reference survey was the most serious factor affecting the estimation of the magnetic anomaly change because GPS was still in an early stage at that time. However, our analysis revealed that the magnetic anomaly change over the Asama Volcano area from 1992 to 2005 exceeded the estimated error at three locations, one of which is interpreted as a loss of magnetization induced by volcanic activity. In this study, we suffered from the problem of positioning inaccuracy in the 1992 survey data, and it was important to evaluate its effect when deriving the magnetic anomaly change.","Magnetic anomaly change,V olcanic activity,Aeromagnetic anomalies,Asama Volcano,Mis-tie control method,"
"anomaly detection and assessment of pm10 functional data at several locations in the klang valley, malaysia","2015","In environmental data sets, the occurrence of a high concentration of an unusual pollutant, more formally known as an anomaly, may indicate air quality problems. Thus, a critical understanding of the behavior of anomalies is increasingly becoming very important for air pollution investigations. This study was conducted to detect anomalies in daily PM10 functional data, to investigate the patterns of behavior as well as to identify possible factors that determine PM10 anomalies at three selected air quality monitoring stations (Klang, Kuala Selangor and Petaling Jaya) in the Klang Valley, Malaysia. The statistical method employed to detect these anomalies consisted of a combination of the robust projection pursuit and the robust Mahalanobis distance methods using air quality data recorded from 2005 to 2010. Analysis of obtained anomalous PM10 profiles showed that data recorded during El Nino years (2005, 2006 and 2009) contained the highest frequency of anomalies. More frequent anomalies appeared during the southwest (SW) monsoon which occurs in the months of July and August as well as during the northeast (NE) monsoon in February. A lesser number of anomalies were also observed during weekends compared to weekdays. The weekend and monsoonal effect phenomena were shown to be significantly existent at all stations while wind speed was positively associated with extreme PM10 anomalies at the Klang and Petaling Jaya stations. In conclusion, anomalies detection was found useful for air pollution investigation in this study. The findings of this study imply that the location and background of a station, as well as wind speed, seasonal (monsoon) and weekdays-weekend variations play important role in influencing PM10 anomalies.","anomaly detection,air quality monitoring,PM,functional data,"
"context-enhanced vessel prediction based on ornstein-uhlenbeck processes using historical ais traffic patterns: real-world experimental results","2014","Traffic route analysis and prediction are both essential for maritime security. Specifically, the prediction of a vessel position is useful to provide alerts about upcoming events (e.g., opportunities and threats). However, accurate prediction along a route in the maritime domain is a challenging task, due to the complex and dynamic nature of traffic patterns. This paper presents a vessel prediction method, based on the popular Ornstein-Uhlenbeck stochastic processes, whose parameters are estimated from historical patterns of life. The historical traffic routes are obtained by pre-processing Automatic Identification System (AIS) data via the CMRE tool called Traffic Route Extraction for Anomaly Detection (TREAD). These recurrent routes allow prediction of the position of a vessel that is following one of these routes, surprisingly, by several hours. The method is validated using a case study related to the second data campaign of the EC FP7 Project New Service Capabilities for Integrated and Advanced Maritime Surveillance (NEREIDS)1. We demonstrate that the prediction accuracy is well represented by the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model.","surveillance,New Service Capabilities for Integrated and Advanced Maritime Surveillance,anomaly detection,security of data,Stochastic processes,Predictive models,Transmitters,historical AIS traffic pattern,vessel position prediction uncertainty,context enhanced vessel prediction method,NEREIDS,automatic identification system,CMRE tool,stochastic processes,marine engineering,Target tracking,maritime domain,Radar tracking,Real-time systems,Ornstein-Uhlenbeck stochastic process,traffic route extraction,traffic engineering computing,parameter estimation,Data mining,traffic route analysis,EC FP7 Project,"
"an overview of cawses-india program with emphasis to equatorial atmospheric coupling processes","2012","This paper presents an overview of CAWSES—India program, highlighting some of the Indian coordinated efforts to understand the Sun−Earth system as a whole, with special emphasis to the equatorial and low latitude phenomena. Two multi-institutional, multi-instrument campaigns, one under ‘Space Weather: Science and Applications’ and the other emphasizing tides under ‘Atmospheric Coupling Processes’ were conducted during February–April 2006. The highlights of the campaigns include improved prediction of equatorial spread-F (ESF) based on a ‘new factor’ combining the strength and asymmetry of the equatorial ionization anomaly (EIA); simultaneous detection of quasi-2-day wave at both E and F region heights; tomographic image showing a Traveling Ionospheric Disturbance (TID) in association with a counter electrojet (CEJ) event—all highlighting the neutral and electrodynamical coupling of the equatorial ionosphere−thermosphere regions; an unusual lowering of mesospheric temperature during a moderate geomagnetic storm—highlighting a new space weather effect; diurnal tide showing a peak amplitude of 35m/s at 45km in zonal wind and a significantly lower amplitude (∼15m/s) in the meridional wind and also evidence of convective activity in the lower atmosphere influencing the tidal variability in the Mesosphere−Lower Thermosphere (MLT) region highlighting the vertical coupling of the atmospheric regions. The development of models for equatorial and low latitude ionosphere has been among the prime activities taken up under ‘Space Climate’. Two models have been developed towards this end: one based on Second Degree (SD) relationships of F region parameters to the mean sun spot number and the other a Multiple Regression Analysis (MRA) based model involving expressions relating F region parameters to that representing solar and geomagnetic activities. The two models, intended for long and short term predictions, have been found to represent the equatorial and low latitude ionosphere over Indian longitudes better than the commonly used International Reference Ionosphere (IRI). Under the theme of ‘Solar Influence on Atmospheric Climate’, a study has been made on the effects of solar variability on middle atmosphere using satellite data and model simulations, highlighting the significant differences between them.","Ionosphere,Magnetosphere,CAWSES,Stratosphere–troposphere,Solarwind,Mesosphere,Thermosphere,"
"meteorological regimes modulating dust outbreaks in southwest asia: the role of pressure anomaly and inter-tropical convergence zone on the 1–3 july 2014 case","2015","The present work examines the characteristics (source regions, pathways, vertical profiles) as well as the meteorological conditions and the role of the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) during a dust event on 1–3 July 2014 over southwest (SW) Asia. NCEP/NCAR reanalysis, meteorological and satellite remote sensing (MODIS, Meteosat, CALIPSO) observations are utilized. The major dust storm (AOD550 up to 1.5–2.0) was generated in the southern Karakum desert in Turkmenistan as a result of intense north winds (Levar), due to enhanced pressure gradient between the Caspian Sea and Hindu Kush Mountains. The dust storm was vertically extended up to 5km over the arid terrain of SW Asia, as a consequence of the deep mixing layer and increased convection, while over northern Arabian Sea it was mixed with another dust plume coming from Arabia and marine aerosols due to strong monsoon winds within the boundary layer. The regional topography, variations in pressure, monsoon circulation and the position of the ITCZ play a decisive role on modulation of the wind field, dust-storm pathways and vertical distribution of dust. Enhanced knowledge of atmospheric circulation and processes responsible for dust export over SW Asia and Arabian Sea in linkage to the Levar wind and Indian summer monsoon is essential for improving dust forecasts and simulations over the region.","MSLP anomalies,SW Asia,ITCZ position,Dust storm,Karakum desert,Vertical dust distribution,"

"mobility pattern analysis of ship trajectories based on semantic transformation and topic model","2020","Recognition and understanding of ship mobility pattern have great significance for intelligent maritime applications, i.e. route discovery and anomaly detection. Besides a number of pattern discovery techniques currently derived from ship trajectory, topic modeling popular in the field of Natural Language Processing may provide a novel way to detect implicit patters underlying massive ship trajectories treated as documents. This paper is motivated to apply a semantic analysis method to explore potential mobility patterns from ship trajectories in inland river by combining semantic transformation and topic model. A coarse-grained semantic transformation model is firstly defined to translate each ship trajectory into a document containing a series of sequential motion words. A motion word is generally a synthetic semantic representation of three trajectory features (location, course and speed). All ship trajectories can then be examined and analyzed as a document corpus. A classic topic model (i.e. Latent Dirichlet Allocation, LDA) is employed to explore hidden ship mobility patterns from trajectory document corpus. The effectiveness of this approach is illustrated through a case study at Wuhan waterway, located at middle stream of Yangtze River in China.","Ship mobility pattern,Trajectory analysis,Topic modeling,Automatic identification system,"
"environmental impact of disposal of coal mining wastes on soils and plants in rostov oblast, russia","2018","Underground coal mining in Southern European Russia leads to soil cover destruction in areas directly occupied by spoil tips and rock dumps located nearby. Coal producing areas in Rostov Oblast were selected for a detailed consideration. Soil samples were taken from the uppermost horizons: a layer of 0–10cm of spoil tips and surrounding areas, as well as from 1.5m depth vertical soil profiles. The soil samples were analysed for mineral composition, particle-size distribution and gross contents of Cu, Zn, Pb, Ag, Sn, Mo, Ba, Co, Ni, Mn, Ti, V, Cr, Ga, P, Li, Sr, Y, Yb, Nb, Sc and Zr, using emission spectral analysis. The plant species of mining influenced areas were described. The process of Technosol formation at the waste sites was considered separately. Soils have not yet formed as a result of a self-restoration on the spoil tips aged more than 50years and burnt-out decades ago. A vegetation cover, which emerged during this time range, practically does not support the progress of any considerable soil-forming process. The ponds formed by the flooding of burning spoil tips, do not give the possibility for the formation of soils and hardly contribute to plant growth. The surface layers of spoil tips at all stages of their development are different from the surrounding steppe soils in geochemical characteristics and mineralogical composition. The atmospheric and water inflow of material from spoil tips changes (in the cases studied - worsens) a state of steppe soils within a radius of 1 km, and leads to the increase of heavy metal content in these soils.","Geochemical impact assessment,Heavy metals,Technogenic anomalies,Soil pollution,"

"six years of electrified convection over the island of corsica monitored by saetta: general trends and anomalously electrified thunderstorms during african dust south flow events","2022","By means of the SAETTA 3D lightning mapping array, the total lightning activity has been detected in a 240 km × 240 km square domain centred on the island of Corsica located in the West Mediterranean basin, and characterized by a maritime and mountainous environment, with a complex and relatively high relief. The study period covers the months from April to December of the 6 years from 2014 to 2019. Observations are reported with a horizontal resolution of 1 km and a vertical resolution of 0.1 km in terms of density of VHF sources emitted by lightning, and of number of lightning day, in plane- and vertical- projections. Vertical distributions of VHF sources are also provided monthly for the whole period and over the full domain. These 3D long term observations show that the number of lightning days is more important on the main relief of the island. The density of VHF sources exhibits a sharp maximum over the confluence area of the 3 main valleys in the center of the northern part of the island, characterized by a recurrent and vertically well developed lightning activity. The period from 11:00 UTC to 14:00 UTC in July, and in a lesser extent in June and August, is at the origin of this density maximum. This behavior is thus due to a diurnal convection. The whole lightning activity is characterized by 2 maxima in June and September. The first one is linked with the diurnal convection in phase with the maximum elevation of the Sun. The second one must be due to usual large-scale organized thunderstorm events of the fall season. The vertical distribution of VHF sources exhibits an increase in the number of VHF sources from April to August at all altitudes, as well as an increase in the altitude of the main upper peak (from 5.8 km to 10 km) and of the secondary lower peak (from 4.2 km to 6.7 km) of this distribution. From August to December, the opposite evolution appears, except that October is characterized by a strong anomaly with a single intense lower peak at 5.5 km, apparently due to 2 strong events corresponding to anomalously electrified thunderstorms. Several of these anomalously electrified thunderstorms (negative dipoles) are reported. They are all characterized by the movement of cloud cells spatially small and relatively undeveloped vertically propagating from southwest to northeast and associated with a strong transport of desert dust from the African continent. The analysis of the meteorological environment of some of the studied events allows concluding that in each of the studied cases elevated convection was triggered, above the relatively dry atmospheric boundary layer characterized by a strong convective inhibition. The low cloud liquid water content which is a key parameter of the non-inductive charging process is probably a good candidate to explain the anomalous electrification of these events.","Lightning,Anomalous charge structure,Corsica,Aerosol,Long term observations,Convection,African dust,"
"traffic knowledge discovery from ais data","2013","Maritime Situational Awareness (i.e., an effective understanding of activities in and impacting the maritime environment) can be significantly improved by knowledge discovery of maritime traffic patterns. The recent build-up of terrestrial networks and satellite constellations of Automatic Identification System (AIS) receivers provides a rich source of cooperative vessel movement information. This vast amount of information can not be fully utilized by human operators and poses new storage and computational challenges. A compact representation of this rapidly increasing amount of information gives operational utility to data which would otherwise be ignored. This paper proposes an unsupervised and incremental learning approach to extract the historical traffic patterns from AIS data. The presented methodology called Traffic Route Extraction for Anomaly Detection (TREAD) effectively processes raw AIS data to infer different levels of contextual information, spanning from the identification of ports and off-shore platforms to spatial and temporal distributions of traffic routes. Furthermore, the accurate understanding of the historical traffic enables the classification and prediction of vessel behaviours as well as the detection of low-likelihood behaviours, or anomalies. The ultimate goal is to provide operators with a configurable knowledge framework supporting day by day decision making and general awareness of vessel pattern of life activity. The methodology is demonstrated via a real-world case study, which can be used as a reference data set for further analysis.","data mining,raw AIS data,traffic route extraction for anomaly detection,Vectors,TREAD,unsupervised learning,operational utility,maritime traffic patterns,unsupervised learning approach,incremental learning approach,low-likelihood behaviours,maritime situational awareness,automatic identification system,Knowledge discovery,marine engineering,Entropy,traffic information systems,configurable knowledge framework,traffic knowledge discovery,Trajectory,Receivers,Surveillance,Data mining,historical traffic patterns,"
"maritime situation analysis: a multi-vessel interaction and anomaly detection framework","2014","Maritime security is critical for protecting sea lanes, ports, harborsand other critical infrastructure against a broad range of threats and illegal activities like smuggling, human trafficking, piracy and terrorism.

In this paper, we propose a novel situation analysis approach to analyze, detect and differentiate a range of interaction patterns and anomalies of interest for marine vessels that operate over some period of time in relative proximity to each other. We analyze vessel interaction scenarios to model common patterns as probabilistic processes in terms of hidden Markov models.

"malicious ais spoofing and abnormal stealth deviations: a comprehensive statistical framework for maritime anomaly detection","2021","The automatic identification system (AIS) is an essential and economical equipment for collision avoidance and maritime surveillance. However, AIS can be subject to intentional reporting of false information, or â€œspoofingâ€. This article assumes the vessel trajectory nominally follows a piecewise mean-reverting process; thereby, it addresses the problem of establishing whether a vessel is reporting adulterated position information through AIS messages in order to hide its current planned route and a possible deviation from the nominal route. Multiple hypothesis testing suggests a framework to enlist reliable information from monitoring systems (coastal radars and space-born satellite sensors) in support of detection of anomalies, spoofing, and stealth deviations.

"maritime traffic networks: from historical positioning data to unsupervised maritime traffic monitoring","2018","The large maritime traffic volume and its implications in economy, environment, safety, and security require an unsupervised system to monitor maritime traffic. In this paper, a method is proposed to automatically produce synthetic maritime traffic representations from historical self-reporting positioning data, more specifically from automatic identification system data. The method builds a two-layer network that represents the maritime traffic in the monitored area, where the external layer presents the network's basic structure and the inner layer provides precision and granularity to the representation. The method is tested in a specific scenario with high traffic density, the Baltic Sea. Experimental results reveal a decrease of over 99% storage data with a negligible precision drop. Finally, the novel method presents a light and structured representation of the maritime traffic, which sets the foundations to real-time automatic maritime traffic monitoring, anomaly detection, and situation prediction.","two-layer network,automatic identification system data,anomaly detection,traffic monitoring,synthetic maritime traffic representations,unsupervised maritime traffic monitoring,statistical analysis,real-time automatic maritime traffic monitoring,situation prediction,ships,marine engineering,maritime surveillance,AIS,Artificial intelligence,high traffic density,maritime traffic networks,Sensors,traffic engineering computing,Navigation,Surveillance,Baltic Sea,Data mining,Maritime traffic representation,Security,self-reporting positioning data,"
"spatiotemporal variability in bio-optical characteristics of the southwestern tropical indian ocean during boreal summer: biophysical influences","2022","The bio-optical characteristics of the surface ocean play a pivotal role in radiative transfer and photosynthetic carbon fixation. To examine spatiotemporal variability of bio-optical properties in the tropical Indian Ocean, a 10-day time-series comparative study was made at one fixed and 3 variable stations in the southwestern tropical Indian Ocean (SWTIO), and 4-stations in the Equatorial Indian Ocean (EIO) during June 2014. A total of 24 hyperspectral radiometer profiles were collected along with physicochemical parameters and phytoplankton pigments analysis. A negative sea level anomaly (SLA), higher precipitation, a more stable mixed layer, and higher buoyancy frequency (N2) were observed in SWTIO compared to EIO. The deep chlorophyll maxima (DCM) in SWTIO were characterised by deep biomass maxima (DBM) whereas in the EIO it was due to deep photoacclimation maxima (DAM). The photosynthetically available radiation (PAR) profiles were obtained by integrating downwelling irradiance from 400 to 700 nm suggesting that the SWTIO had a greater abundance of optically active substances (OAS) than the EIO. Surface chlorophyll a (Chl-a) was found to have significant relationships with phytoplankton absorption coefficient (aph(443)). Chl-a-specific phytoplankton absorption coefficients (a*ph(443)), total absorption coefficient (at(443)), and particulate backscattering (bbp(555)) were also related to Chl-a implying that the phytoplankton was in growth/active phase. The time-series variability of the phytoplankton and changes in the photosynthetic pigments (PSP) to photoprotective pigments (PPP) ratio at SWTIO suggested phytoplankton community shift during 5th to 7th days. Microplankton percent-abundances showed distinct linear relationships with Chl-a and bbp(555) implying that carbon fixation per unit Chl-a was higher in microplankton than in nano and picoplankton at SWTIO. The in situ Chl-a, aph(443), adg(443), Kd(490) and C¯ pd were used to validate the various empirical algorithms available as well as the satellite-retrieved data. The MODIS and VIIRS data correlated moderately. This study would help towards improving regional optimized algorithms for OAS and provide a baseline understanding of the scale of variability of primary production and carbon flux from space. In addition, this would contribute valuable bio-optical data from an under-sampled geographical area.","Subsurface stratification,Light absorption,Tropical Indian Ocean,Particulate backscattering,Deep chlorophyll maxima,Phytoplankton pigments,"
"discovering maritime traffic route from ais network","2016","The recent build-up network of Automatic Identification System (AIS) equipped on vessels provides a rich source of vessel movement information. AIS is originally designed for automatically exchanging navigation information, such as their unique identification, position, course, and speed, with nearby vessels and terrestrial receivers to affect collision avoidance and safety control. The collected sequences of AIS logs can be considered as maritime trajectory data, i.e., the sequences of location points with timestamps. This vast amount of AIS trajectory data can be collected and employed to achieve an awareness of maritime traffic knowledge. This paper is devoted to discovery of maritime traffic route from trajectory data generated by AIS networks. However, AIS trajectory data discovery is a challenging task because of the trajectory data is available with uncertainty. Furthermore, unlike the vehicles' movements are constrained by road networks, there is no such a sea route for vessels to follow in marine areas. To overcome the challenges, we propose a framework of Maritime Traffic Route Discovery (abbreviated as MTRD) to generate pattern-aware routes to achieve an effective understanding of maritime traffic awareness. The proposed framework is evaluated on real AIS data and the experimental results shows that the proposed MTRD is able to extract the marine traffic route effectively and provides a cornerstone of maritime traffic knowledge for traffic management, anomaly detection, and conflict analysis in the future.","data mining,MTRD,AIS trajectory data discovery,terrestrial receivers,anomaly detection,AIS logs,traffic management,marine navigation,Global Positioning System,vessel movement information,Trajectory pattern mining,Trajectory data,Electronic mail,AIS network,maritime traffic knowledge,automatic identification system,marine safety,location point sequences,maritime trajectory data,Artificial intelligence,safety control,vehicle movements,maritime traffic route discovery,Roads,Trajectory,Uncertainty,traffic engineering computing,AIS trajectory data,AIS System,Maritime Traffic knowledge,automatic navigation information exchange,collision avoidance,conflict analysis,Data mining,maritime traffic awareness,Traffic Route Discovery,"
"ship speed power performance under relative wind profiles in relation to sensor fault detection","2018","Statistical data analysis and visualization approaches to identify ship speed power performance under relative wind (i.e. apparent wind) profiles are considered in this study. Ship performance and navigation data of a selected vessel are analyzed, where various data anomalies, i.e. sensor related erroneous data conditions, are identified. Those erroneous data conditions are investigated and several approaches to isolate such situations are also presented by considering appropriate data visualization methods. Then, the cleaned data are used to derive various relationships among ship performance and navigation parameters that have been visualized in this study, appropriately. The results show that the wind profiles along ship routes can be used to evaluate vessel performance and navigation conditions by assuming the respective sea states relate to their wind conditions. Hence, the results are useful to derive appropriate mathematical models that represent ship performance and navigation conditions. Such mathematical models can be used for weather routing type applications (i.e. voyage planning), where the respective weather forecast can be used to derive optimal ship routes to improve vessel performance and reduce fuel consumption. This study presents not only an overview of statistical data analysis of ship performance and navigation data but also the respective challenges in data anomalies (i.e. erroneous data intervals and sensor faults) due to onboard sensors and data handling systems. Furthermore, the respective solutions to such challenges in data quality have also been presented by considering data visualization approaches.","Speed power performance,Data anomaly detection,Sensor fault identification,Weather routing,Ship wind profile,Statistical data analysis,"

"a biogeochemical orientation survey in the moisan gold-mineralized area, haenam district in korea","2011","A biogeochemical orientation survey was carried out in the vicinity of an epithermal Au deposit in the Moisan Au–Ag mineralized area, Haenam district in Korea. The Au–Ag bearing quartz veins of the mine occur as narrow open-space fillings within Cretaceous silicic pyroclastics. The vein minerals consist mainly of quartz, sericite, pyrite, chalcopyrite, and galena, with some electrum and argentite. The main objectives of this study were to study the geochemical characteristics of rocks, soils and plants in this area, to investigate the spatial relationship between Au and associated elements in rock–soil–plant system, and to evaluate the applicability of biogeochemical prospecting for Au vein occurrences in Korea. Samples of rocks and soils, and leaves of three plant species (Japanese red pine — P. densiflora, oriental white oak — Q. aliena, Japanese mallotus — M. japonicus) were collected from the target mineralized area and control barren locations, and analyzed for trace elements by instrumental neutron activation analysis. Sampling lines were composed of one slope line which is almost parallel to the mineralized quartz-veins, and four transect lines spaced 100m apart across the veins at 20m sampling intervals. From the multi-element data of rock samples (n=9), high values of Au (maximum 2030ppb) are spatially related to Au–quartz veins. Soil samples (n=61) collected from five sampling lines show higher values of Au (24–825ppb) whereas soil samples from the control locations have lower values of Au (below 25ppb). Many plant species collected from the vicinity of the veins have high Au contents compared with those at the control locations, but the ranges of Au values are variable among plant species. In a total of 128 samples of plant leaves, Q. aliena yielded Au values of 0.4 to 6.9ppb, and M. japonicus 0.9 to 4.1ppb. Gold contents in P. densiflora ranged from 0.1 to 5.6ppb. Plant leaves from control areas show less than 1.6ppb Au. The biological absorption coefficient (BAC) of Au in plants decreases in the order of Q. aliena>M. japonicus>P. densiflora. Based on the results of the study, Q. aliena appeared to be the best sampling media for biogeochemical prospecting of Au in the study area.","Au anomaly,Biogeochemical survey,Gold–quartz veins,"

"automatic self-reconstruction model for radio map in wi-fi fingerprinting","2022","The Wi-Fi fingerprinting is applied to the indoor positioning system (IPS) based on the radio map, which is the established received signal strength indication (RSSI) fingerprint database. However, since static radio maps built offline are vulnerable to environmental dynamics, interruptions occur in the online phase. To solve this problem, in this paper, we propose an Automatic Self-Reconstruction (ASR) model that combines Radio Encoding-based Deep Fingerprint Positioning (RE-DFP) and Radio Anomaly Detecting (RAD), which enables seamless positioning of Wi-Fi fingerprinting. The proposed model consists of an encoder-decoder-based RE-DFP network to improve positioning accuracy and data efficiency and a RAD network to analyze environmental dynamics according to APs. In the proposed RE-DFP, a CNN-based encoder is applied to increase efficiency by minimizing the dependence of the radio map, and the position is estimated through an LSTM-based decoder. RAD identifies the AP, which is the cause of the change in the radio map and excludes it from the online phase, preventing a decrease in positioning accuracy. Simultaneously, the proposed model collects the RSSI of the identified AP through crowdsourcing and reconstructs the radio map by itself, enabling a seamless positioning service in the online phase.","Radio map,RE-DFP,Indoor positioning system,Fingerprinting,RAD,"
"predictive maintenance leveraging machine learning for time-series forecasting in the maritime industry","2020","One of the key challenges in the maritime industry refers to minimizing the time a vessel cannot be utilized, which has multiple effects. The latter is addressed through maintenance approaches that however in many cases are not efficient in terms of cost and downtime. Predictive maintenance provides optimized maintenance scheduling offering extended vessel lifespan, coupled with reduced maintenance costs. As in several industries, including the maritime domain, an increasing amount of data is made available through the deployment and exploitation of data sources, such as on board sensors that provide real-time information. These data provide the required ground for analysis and thus support for various types of data-driven decision making. In the maritime domain, sensors are deployed on vessels to monitor their engines and data analysis tools are needed to assist engineers towards reduced operational risk through predictive maintenance solutions that are put in place. In this paper, we present an approach for anomaly detection on time-series data, utilizing machine learning on the vessels sensor data, in order to predict the condition of specific parts of the vessel's main engine and thus facilitate predictive maintenance.

"an application of sensor-based anomaly detection in the maritime industry","2016","In this paper we present an application of sensor-based anomaly detection in maritime transport. The study is based on real sensor data streamed from a ship to shore, where the data is analysed through a big data analytics platform. The novelty of this work originates in the use of data from sensors covering different aspects of the ship operation, exemplified here by propulsion power, speed over ground and ship motion in four different degrees of freedom.

"lithological and alteration mineral mapping in poorly exposed lithologies using landsat-8 and aster satellite data: north-eastern graham land, antarctic peninsula","2019","Antarctica remains a remote and logistically difficult region to conduct geological field mapping and mineral exploration. Remote sensing satellite imagery has high potential to provide a solution to overcome the difficulties and limitations associated with geological field mapping and mineral exploration in inaccessible regions. In this study, the applications of Landsat-8 and the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) data were investigated to extract geological information for lithological and alteration mineral mapping in poorly exposed lithologies located in inaccessible regions. The north-eastern Graham Land, Antarctic Peninsula (AP) was selected in this study to conduct a satellite-based remote sensing mapping approach. A two-stage methodology was adopted to distinguish pixel and sub-pixel targets in the satellite images. In the first stage, Continuum Removal (CR) spectral mapping tool and Independent Components Analysis (ICA) technique were applied to Landsat-8 and ASTER spectral bands to map the pixels related to poorly exposed lithological units. The second step was established based on the application of target detection algorithms to shortwave infrared bands of ASTER for detecting spectral features attributed to alteration mineral assemblages at the sub-pixel level. Pixels composed of distinctive absorption features of alteration mineral assemblages and Si-O bond emission minima features were detected by applying CR mapping tool to reflective and thermal bands of Landsat-8 and ASTER. Anomaly pixels related to spectral features of Al-O–H, Fe, Mg-O–H and CO3 groups as well as lithological attributions from felsic to mafic rocks were detected by the implementation of ICA technique to reflective and thermal bands of Landsat-8 and ASTER. ICA method provided image maps of alteration mineral assemblages and lithological units (mafic to felsic trend) for poorly mapped and/or unmapped regions. Fractional abundance of alteration minerals such as muscovite, kaolinite, illite, montmorillonite, epidote, chlorite and biotite were detected in poorly exposed lithologies using target detection algorithms. Several prospecting areas for Cu, Mo, Au and Ag mineralization related to propyllitically and argillically altered units of Andean Intrusive Suite (AIS) were identified in the southern sector of the study region. The results of this investigation demonstrated the applicability of Landsat-8 and ASTER spectral data for lithological and alteration mineral mapping in poorly exposed lithologies located in inaccessible regions, particularly using the image processing algorithms that are capable of detecting anomaly pixels and sub-pixel targets in the remotely sensed images, where no prior information is available. In conclusion, a simple and robust satellite-based remote sensing approach for mapping poorly exposed lithologies in inaccessible regions was established, which is comprehensively applicable for lithological and alteration mineral mapping in the Antarctic environments and hydrothermal ore minerals prospecting in other inaccessible regions around the world.","Inaccessible regions,Landsat-8,Antarctic Peninsula,Graham Land,Poorly exposed lithologies,ASTER,Satellite-based remote sensing approach,"
"a systematic literature review of iot time series anomaly detection solutions","2022","The rapid spread of the Internet of Things (IoT) devices has prompted many people and companies to adopt the IoT paradigm, as this paradigm allows the automation of several processes related to data collection and monitoring. In this context, the sensors (or other devices) generate huge amounts of data while monitoring physical spaces and objects. Therefore, the problem of managing and analyzing these huge amounts of data has stimulated researchers and practitioners to adopt anomaly detection techniques, which are automated solutions to enable the recognition of abnormal behaviors occurring in complex systems. In particular, in IoT environments, anomaly detection very often involves the analysis of time series data and this analysis should be accomplished under specific time or resource constraints. In this systematic literature review, we focus on the IoT time series anomaly detection problem by analyzing 62 articles written from 2014 to 2021. Specifically, we explore the methods and techniques adopted by researchers to deal with the issues related to dimensionality reduction, anomaly localization, and real-time monitoring, also discussing the datasets used, and the real-case scenarios tested.

"the role of the stratosphere in iberian peninsula rainfall: a preliminary approach in february","2007","This paper attempts to establish a connection between stratospheric anomalies in the North Pole and rainfall on the Iberian Peninsula through the occurrence of major midwinter warmings (MMWs) and cold events (CEs), taking February as a preliminary approach. We define the MMWs as the warmings which break down the polar vortex, whereas the CEs are the episodes in which the polar vortex remains cold and undisturbed. Both anomalies lead to a wind anomaly around the north polar stratosphere, which is connected with a shortly lagged tropospheric anomaly through a stratosphere–troposphere coupling in winter. A T-mode principal component analysis (PCA) was used as an objective pattern classification method for identifying the main daily surface-level pressure (SLP) patterns for February for the 1961–1990 reference period. Subsequently, those February months with an MMW or a CE influence in the troposphere are identified in the whole study period (1958–2000) by means of the Arctic Oscillation Index (AOI). Thus, performing the same analysis for the selected February months, new principal patterns for detecting changes in surface circulation structure and morphology are obtained. The results show a significant decrease in the westerlies and a southward shift of the storm tracks in Western Europe some weeks after an MMW occurrence, leading to an increase in precipitation in western Iberia and a slight decrease on the eastern Mediterranean fringe. The results are quite the opposite under a CE influence: the westerlies are strengthened and shifted northwards due to the displacement of the Atlantic anticyclone towards Central Europe; dry conditions are established throughout Iberia, except for the Mediterranean fringe, where precipitation shows a considerable increase due to the greater frequency of the northeasterly winds. Finally, an 11-year sunspot cycle–quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) modulation might be demonstrated in Iberian rainfall in February through the occurrence of these stratospheric anomalies.","Arctic Oscillation Index,Principal component analysis,Stratosphere–troposphere coupling,Circulation patterns,Major midwinter warming,Iberian rainfall,"
"variability of lightning flash and thunderstorm over east/southeast asia on the enso time scales","2016","The variability of lightning flash and thunderstorm on the ENSO time scales over East/Southeast Asia was investigated by using 17-year (1995–2011) lightning data from the Optical Transient Detector (OTD) and Lightning Imaging Sensor (LIS), and 14-year (1998–2011) Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission satellite (TRMM) precipitation feature data. In addition, ERA-Interim reanalysis data of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) were used to present related environmental characteristics. It was found that the response of lightning flash to ENSO events shows remarkable seasonal and regional variations. The regions of positive (negative) lightning anomaly are mainly located at both sides of 5°–20°N (5°–15°N) in El Niño (La Niña) spring and winter, and located north of the equator in summer and autumn. There is a significantly positive correlation between lightning anomaly and the Oceanic Niño Index (ONI) over both East China and Indonesia during El Niño episodes, but no obvious correlation during La Niña episodes. The positive thunderstorm anomalies during El Niño periods are dispersed. The distribution of thunderstorm anomalies in La Niña summer and autumn is almost opposite to that in spring and winter. The correlation between thunderstorm anomaly and ONI is better over East China than that over Indonesia. In general, lightning variation follows thunderstorm intensity (number) variation over East China during El Niño (La Niña) episodes, and follows a combination of thunderstorm intensity and number variations over Indonesia on ENSO time scales. During ENSO time scales, variations of surface wind can be considered as one of the key factors to LAs. More lightning flashes present in the regions where warm moist flows intersection, and less in the regions where surface wind changes slightly or diverges. Dramatic lightning increases also occur with higher values of convective available potential energy (CAPE). In addition, higher (lower) 850hPa relative humidity generally follows with more (less) lightning flashes, which is more obvious during El Niño episodes.","Lightning,ENSO,East/Southeast Asia,Meteorological factor,Thunderstorm,"

"multi-scale analysis reveals changing distribution patterns and the influence of social structure on the habitat use of an endangered marine predator, the sperm whale physeter macrocephalus in the western mediterranean sea","2020","The habitat use of marine megafauna emerges from the complex interplay between access to patchy and variable food resources and several intrinsic biological factors, such as the interaction with conspecifics and offspring care, resulting in dynamic distribution patterns. Quantifying species' relationships with the underlying environment is further complicated by the scale-dependent nature of these processes. Multi-scale analyses that incorporate aspects of a species' biology and build on large datasets are therefore required to understand long-term distribution and inform appropriate management measures. In this study, we use monitoring data collected over two study periods (2003–2008 and 2012–2018) to assess the habitat use, trend in local occurrence, and change in distribution of sperm whales, Physeter macrocephalus, around the Balearic Islands (Spain), one of the few recognised breeding and feeding grounds for the ‘Endangered’ population in the Mediterranean Sea. Moreover, we investigate the differences in the habitat use of single animals and groups, to explore intra-specific niche partitioning in this highly social but behaviourally dimorphic species. Results suggest that overall the occurrence of sperm whales in the area has been increasing over time. Animals were found to associate with distinct bathymetric features, but the mechanisms generating these relationships, and the underlying oceanographic processes within this habitat, remained uncertain. Sperm whale distribution also underwent a significant shift between the two study periods, with an increased occurrence in the Mallorca channel and north of Menorca, which further points towards a dynamic use of the broader bathymetric range preferred around the archipelago. Finally, our analyses highlighted that single animals and groups used areas with different characteristics, with groups preferring deeper, warmer waters characterised by lower sea level anomaly, which resulted in some fine-scale spatial segregation. The results of this study shed light on the mechanisms underpinning the biogeography and complex social system of the species, and support the design of targeted conservation measures in this important breeding and feeding ground.","Mediterranean sea,Distribution shift,Balearic archipelago,Sperm whale,Long-term monitoring,Habitat modeling,"

"development of a time series imaging approach for fault classification of marine systems","2022","As part of any Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) system for the shipping industry, the determination of the current health of marine systems is fundamental. As such, diagnostic analytics is performed; a process that is typically constituted by fault detection, fault isolation, and fault identification. Although some efforts have been made to distinguish the faults and malfunctions (fault detection) that can occur in marine systems, the implementation of fault identification to provide a description of any considered fault type and its nature is still an unexplored area due to the lack of fault data. To overcome this, a methodology for the identification of anomalies in marine systems is presented in this paper. The proposed approach aims to analyse the implementation of time series imaging through the application of the first-order Markov chain in tandem with an analysis of both ResNet50V2 and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) as part of the image classification task.

"early anomaly detection in smart home: a causal association rule-based approach","2018","As the world's population grows older, an increasing number of people are facing health issues. For the elderly, living alone can be difficult and dangerous. Consequently, smart homes are becoming increasingly popular. A sensor-rich environment can be exploited for healthcare applications, in particular, anomaly detection (AD). The literature review for this paper showed that few works consider environmental factors to detect anomalies. Instead, the focus is on user activity and checking whether it is abnormal, i.e., does not conform to expected behavior. Furthermore, reducing the number of anomalies using early detection is a major issue in many applications. In this context, anomaly-cause discovery may be helpful in recommending actions that may prevent risk. In this paper, we present a novel approach for detecting the risk of anomalies occurring in the environment regarding user activities. The method relies on anomaly-cause extraction from a given dataset using causal association rules mining. These anomaly causes are utilized afterward for real-time analysis to detect the risk of anomalies using the Markov logic network machine learning method. The detected risk allows the method to recommend suitable actions to perform in order to avoid the occurrence of an actual anomaly. The proposed approach is implemented, tested, and evaluated for each contribution using real data obtained from an intelligent environment platform and real data from a clinical datasets. Experimental results prove our approach to be efficient in terms of recognition rate.","Anomaly detection,Markov logic network,Smart homes,Causal association rules,"
"effect of smart meter data collection frequency in an early detection of shorter-duration voltage anomalies in smart grids","2019","Smart grids are required to respond quickly and efficiently to any types of electrical incidents. This is possible only if advanced monitoring and decision support tools are available for the operators to collect and analyze the real-time data from the entire power system. Sensors and smart meters become necessary for an effective smart grid operation, as they can play a significant role in measuring system parameters such as the temperature of the transmission line, power outages and power usage. These sensors allow communication between the generation side and user side to ensure full network observability. Hence, the volume of data which needs to be analyzed for more reliable electrical services has been increased. Upon the analysis of all the data collected, useful insights can be gained to bring benefits to the utilities, consumers and the related organizations. In this project, the effect of smart meter data collection frequencies on the early detection of short-duration voltage anomalies has been investigated. An anomaly detection algorithm that analyzes the voltages collected from smart meters is developed. The proposed anomaly detector checks the normality of the voltage data collected from the smart meters installed at the residential loads. To test the effectiveness of the frequent-and-large smart meter data, a smart grid model was simulated in MATLAB/Simulink and the model was tested under three different operating conditions. The efficacy of the anomaly detector with the smart meter data collected at different data collection intervals was compared under the three operating conditions. The investigation of the smart meter data clearly shows that the shorter-duration anomalies can be detected effectively with more frequent data and hence it reveals the potential of smart meters in the early detection of short-duration anomalies in smart grids.","Smart devices,Anomaly detection system,Photovoltaic system,Large data,Smart grid,"
"low-cost, intelligent drifter fleet for large-scale, distributed ocean observation","2022","We have developed Persistent Environmental Awareness Reporting and Location (PEARL) ocean drifters. PEARL drifters are small, rugged, low-cost, autonomous, environmentally friendly ocean drifters that represent a significant opportunity for high-impact applications in both national security and environmental ecosystem monitoring. Drifters record and report data which is processed by advanced edge analytics before being compressed for satellite transmission to populate a large data repository with sensor data that is combined and analyzed to discover signals of interest in the ocean environment with the goal of increasing distributed maritime awareness. Each drifter is entirely self-contained, powered by solar panels and backup batteries, with a large array of sensors, compute module for onboard data processing, and satellite modem for data reporting. The drifter architecture is flexible and can be customized for a specific purpose. The complete data record is stored locally and processed by the onboard compute module, which runs anomaly detection algorithms that detect nearby activity. Anomalous events, as well as baseline environmental data, are reported to a cloud database using satellite short burst data transmission. Though each independent drifter is a powerful sensing tool, the low unit cost permits large scale deployment. To date thousands of drifters have been deployed over vast areas of the ocean and are reporting data to a remote database where cloud-based analytics algorithms develop global situational awareness and update local edge algorithms on the drifters based on learnings across the full network.","Satellites,data reporting,remote sensing,distributed ocean observation,complete data record,environmental ecosystem monitoring,Location ocean drifters,lagrangian drifter,intelligent drifter fleet,high-impact applications,anomaly detection,maritime domain awareness,drifter architecture,Persistent Environmental Awareness Reporting,Distributed databases,environmental data,vessel tracking,satellite communication,marine systems,Turning,oceanographic equipment,sensor data,advanced edge analytics,onboard compute module,cloud computing,ocean circulation,baseline environmental data,satellite transmission,Oceans,geophysics computing,data reduction,ocean environment,maritime awareness,satellite modem,data repository,edge processing,PEARL drifters,oceanographic regions,onboard data processing,Roads,cloud-edge algorithms,Cloud computing,national security,satellite short burst data transmission,Sensors,environmentally friendly ocean drifters,oceanographic techniques,"
"filament formation and evolution in buoyant coastal waters: observation and modelling","2012","This paper presents a detailed analysis of the formation and subsequent evolution of filament-like structures observed in a relatively small area of the mid-Tyrrhenian Sea (Mediterranean Sea). The filament dynamics and potential impact on the cross-shelf exchange budget are investigated based on a combined use of remote sensing imagery, in situ data and numerical modelling. The complexity of these phenomena is shown by focusing on four distinct events that led to cross-shelf transport, each representative of a different dynamic process and a distinct expected impact on the coastal area. A systematic analysis of available observations for the years 1998–2006 underlines the role of the interplay of atmospheric freshwater fluxes, river loads and wind stress variations, which may create favourable conditions for the convergence of shelf waters (particularly at coastal capes) and the subsequent formation of short-lived filaments along the coast. The response of the buoyant coastal waters to periods of wind reversal and fluctuating freshwater discharge rates is examined through idealised Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) simulations. The filaments observed in remote sensing imagery were well reproduced by the numerical exercise, where the filaments appear as organised submesoscale structures that possess high relative vorticity and develop at the river mouths or adjacent capes. In both scenarios, the filaments appear largely determined by (i) the presence of a buoyancy anomaly, (ii) the angle between the wind pulse direction and the coast and (iii) irregularities in the coastal profile. The ensemble of results suggests that the occurrence of such transient, intense structures may contribute considerably to the biological variability and cross-shelf exchange in coastal areas with similar traits.",""
"maritime situation analysis framework: vessel interaction classification and anomaly detection","2015","Maritime domain awareness is critical for protecting sea lanes, ports, harbors, offshore structures like oil and gas rigs and other types of critical infrastructure against common threats and illegal activities. Typical examples range from smuggling of drugs and weapons, human trafficking and piracy all the way to terror attacks. Limited surveillance resources constrain maritime domain awareness and compromise full security coverage at all times. This situation calls for innovative intelligent systems for interactive situation analysis to assist marine authorities and security personal in their routine surveillance operations. In this article, we propose a novel situation analysis approach to analyze marine traffic data and differentiate various scenarios of vessel engagement for the purpose of detecting anomalies of interest for marine vessels that operate over some period of time in relative proximity to each other. We consider such scenarios as probabilistic processes and analyze complex vessel trajectories using machine learning to model common patterns. Specifically, we represent patterns as left-to-right Hidden Markov Models and classify them using Support Vector Machines. To differentiate suspicious activities from unobjectionable behavior, we explore fusion of data and information, including kinematic features, geospatial features, contextual information and maritime domain knowledge. Our experimental evaluation shows the effectiveness of the proposed approach using comprehensive real-world vessel tracking data from coastal waters of North America.","Kinematics,surveillance,hidden Markov models,interactive situation analysis,Hidden Markov models,Geospatial analysis,anomaly detection,Anomaly Detection,maritime domain awareness,marine traffic data analysis,data fusion,information fusion,data analysis,Maritime Domain Awareness,vessel engagement,routine surveillance operations,marine engineering,support vector machines,kinematic features,probabilistic processes,geospatial features,machine learning,left-to-right hidden Markov models,vessel interaction classification,innovative intelligent systems,pattern classification,contextual information,Time series analysis,maritime situation analysis framework,Critical Infrastructure Protection,Big Data,vessel tracking data,Trajectory,Machine Learning,probability,complex vessel trajectory analysis,pattern representation,traffic engineering computing,Surveillance,maritime domain knowledge,marine vehicles,Intelligent Systems,learning (artificial intelligence),Security,security,"

"automatic fault detection in seismic data using gaussian process regression","2019","Compartmentalization of hydrocarbon reservoirs, change in fluid contacts, effects of high permeable fractures around faults, and hydrocarbon traps created by seal faults make fault detection and extraction as a necessity in the analysis of seismic data. Faulting disrupts the smoothness trend of geological layers (reflections in seismic sections) and displaces layers along its plane. Thus, a fault could be considered as an abnormal phenomenon that globally deviates normal behavior of layers around its plane. In the present study, faults are considered as sparse global anomalies in a seismic section that can be extracted using Gaussian process regression. The Gaussian process regression is a nonparametric probabilistic model based on Bayesian statistics that can be used to model spatial properties as a regression problem. The Gaussian process usually is used to extract and describe normal interactions from the data set using smooth functions. The main idea of this study is to detect the global anomaly using Gaussian process regression. For this purpose, we considered geological layers as smooth normal events in seismic sections. Therefore, the location of the fault plane is where the Gaussian process gets an error during describing the layers. Abnormalities such as faults cause the Gaussian process to suffer an error near the anomaly. We used these errors and analyzed them to detect probable locations of fault edge. Finally, we used a consistent connection algorithm to separate most probable fault points and to connect them to an edge using morphological reconstruction algorithm. The proposed algorithm was evaluated based on the receiver operating characteristics analysis. Several synthetic seismic sections with different levels of signal to noise ratios were used to evaluate the algorithm in the presence of random noise. The results showed that all points predicted by a diagnostic test fell into the area above the diagonal of the receiver operating characteristics space, which represents a good diagnostic classification.","Global anomaly detection,Gaussian process regression,Fault,Reconstruction morphology,"
"mediterranean tropical-like cyclones: impacts and composite daily means and anomalies of synoptic patterns","2018","In the Mediterranean region, a rapidly rotating storm system characterized by gale winds, severe precipitation, and low pressure center, accompanied with a spiral pattern of thunderstorms, is occasionally observed. These tropical-like cyclones (TLC), known as Medicanes or Mediterranean ‘hurricanes’, have similar characteristics with hurricanes and a significant amount of research has been done in recent years to investigate their atmospheric characteristics and impacts. The Laboratory of Climatology and Atmospheric Environment (LACAE), National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, has established a systematic effort since 2009, to document the impact of severe atmospheric phenomena (e.g. medicanes, cyclones, tornadoes, waterspouts), especially over the eastern Mediterranean region. The objective of this study is to discuss on one hand, the intra annual and inter annual distribution of medicanes along with the composite daily means and anomalies of synoptic conditions and instability indices at the middle and lower troposphere, sea level pressure (SLP) and sea surface temperature (SST) as well, during medicane days, based on the National Centers for Environmental Prediction-National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP-NCAR) reanalysis data sets. On the other hand, the geographical distribution of medicane impacts over Mediterranean region with respect to period from 1969 to 2014, is illustrated by utilizing the Geographic Information Systems (GIS). The findings shed light on the high activity of medicanes during autumn and winter with maxima in September, decreasing thereafter with a long tail extending in spring and minimizing in summer. The average number of the selected medicanes is 1.4±1.3 events per year while their inter-annual variability is remarkable, although there is not any statistically significant trend (95% confidence level) within the examined period. We found from the analysis of the composite daily anomalies of the synoptic conditions that medicanes initiate and further develop in Mediterranean regions where cold air intrusions appear in the upper atmosphere associated with warm sea waters. Last but not least, the impacts of medicanes over coastal areas, including infrastructure damage and casualties due to associated strong winds, heavy rainfall, and in rare cases, tornadoes, are well presented, indicating the high concern of such extreme atmospheric phenomena should be given by stake holders towards resilience of the society.","Tropical-like cyclones,Medicanes,Mediterranean,NCEP-NCAR reanalysis,Composite means and anomalies,Impacts,"
"coastal sar and plrm altimetry in german bight and west baltic sea","2018","Unlike previous altimetric missions, the CryoSat-2 altimeter features a novel Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) mode that allows higher resolution and more accurate altimeter-derived parameters in the coastal zone, thanks to the reduced along-track footprint. The scope of this study is to quantify regionally the skills of CryoSat-2 SAR altimetry for distances to coast smaller than 10 km, during the mission lifetime and at different time scales. The validated geophysical altimeter parameters are the sea surface height above the ellipsoid, the significant sea wave height and wind speed, all computed at 20 Hz. These have been compared to in situ and regional model data along the coasts of German Bight and West Baltic Sea during a time interval of almost six years, from July 2010 to March 2016, to investigate both instantaneous and seasonal behaviour. From CryoSat-2 FBR (Full Bit Rate) data, a Delay-Doppler processing and waveform retracking tailored specifically to the coastal zone has been carried out, by applying a Hamming window and zero-padding, using an extended vertical swath window in order to mitigate tracker errors. Moreover, a dedicated SAMOSA-based coastal retracker (here referred to as SAMOSA+) has also been implemented. Since one of the highest remaining uncertainties in the altimeter parameters estimated in coastal shallow waters arises from residual errors in the applied range and geophysical corrections, innovative and high resolution solutions for ocean tide model, geoid, mean sea surface and wet tropospheric correction have been selected. As CryoSat-2 SAR and LRM (Low Rate Mode) modes are not collocated in time, in order to quantify the improvement in the coastal zone with respect to pulse-limited altimetry, 20 Hz PLRM (pseudo-LRM) data from CryoSat-2 FBR were built and retracked, adopting the ALES adaptive sub-waveform approach, with a numerical Brown-based retracker, here referred to as TALES. The cross-validation proves the good consistency between PLRM and SAR sea level anomaly in the coastal zone. The regional ocean model (BSH) shows the highest agreement with the SAR sea level anomaly, with a standard deviation of the differences (stdd) of 24 cm, whereas the corresponding value with respect to PLRM is 55 cm. Distance to coast plots show that land contamination begins to affect sea level and wave measurements at 2 km from the coast in SAR and at 3.5 km in PLRM TALES. The analysis of monthly mean time-series shows that SAR Altimetry is able to measure the sea level monthly mean in the coastal zone of the region of interest, during the entire mission, more precisely than PLRM. The cross-validation against in situ data also proves the higher accuracy of SAR SAMOSA+ compared to PLRM TALES in the coastal zone, with average SLA stdd of 4.4 cm and 8.4 cm respectively.","Sea level,SAR altimetry,CryoSat-2,Coastal altimetry,Retracking,In situ validation,"
"a contextual hybrid model for vessel movement prediction","2021","Predicting the movement of the vessels can significantly improve the management of safety. While the movement can be a function of geographic contexts, the current systems and methods rarely incorporate contextual information into the analysis. This paper initially proposes a novel context-aware trajectoriesâ€™ simplification method to embed the effects of geographic context which guarantees the logical consistency of the compressed trajectories, and further suggests a hybrid method that is built upon a curvilinear model and deep neural networks. The proposed method employs contextual information to check the logical consistency of the curvilinear method and then, constructs a Context-aware Long Short-Term Memory (CLSTM) network that can take into account contextual variables, such as the vessel types. The proposed method can enhance the prediction accuracy while maintaining the logical consistency, through a recursive feedback loop. The implementations of the proposed approach on the Automatic Identification System (AIS) dataset, from the eastern coast of the United States of America which was collected, from November to December 2017, demonstrates the effectiveness and better compression, i.e. 80% compression ratio while maintaining the logical consistency. The estimated compressed trajectories are 23% more similar to their original trajectories compared to currently used simplification methods. Furthermore, the overall accuracy of the implemented hybrid method is 15.68% higher than the ordinary Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network which is currently used by various maritime systems and applications, including collision avoidance, vessel route planning, and anomaly detection systems.","recurrent neural nets,Safety,deep learning (artificial intelligence),Mathematical model,safety management,movement prediction,AIS dataset,Predictive models,curvilinear method,ubiquitous computing,deep neural networks,CLSTM network,ship behavior,deep learning,ships,automatic identification system dataset,marine safety,marine engineering,Data models,contextual hybrid model,contextual information,vessel movement prediction,United States of America,geographic context,data compression,Automatic identification system,vessel types,Trajectory,compressed trajectory estimation,context-aware LSTM network,vessel route planning,Deep learning,Context modeling,context-aware long short-term memory network,logical consistency,context-aware trajectories simplification,"
"grid size optimization for potential field based maritime anomaly detection","2014","This study focuses on improving the potential field based maritime data modeling method, developed to extract traffic patterns and detect anomalies, in a clear, understandable and informative way. The method's novelty lies in employing the concept of a potential field for AIS vessel tracking data abstraction and maritime traffic representation. Unlike the traditional maritime surveillance equipment, such as radar or GPS, the AIS system comprehensively represents the identity and properties of a vessel, as well as its behavior, thus preserving the effects of navigational decisions, based on the skills of experienced seamen. In the developed data modeling process, every vessel generates potential charges, which value represent the vessel's behavior, and drops the charges at locations it passes. Each AIS report is used to assign a potential charge at the reported vessel positions. The method derives three construction elements, which define, firstly, how charges are accumulated, secondly, how a charge decays over time, and thirdly, in what way the potential is distributed around the source charge. The collection of potential fields represents a model of normal behavior, and vessels not conforming to it are marked as anomalous. In the anomaly detection prototype system STRAND, the sensitivity of anomaly detection can be modified by setting a geographical coordinate grid precision to more dense or coarse. The objective of this study is to identify the optimal grid size for two different conditions – an open sea and a port area case. A noticeable shift can be observed between the results for the open sea and the port area. The plotted detection rates converge towards an optimal ratio for smaller grid sizes in the port area (60-200 meters), than in the open sea case (300-1000 meters). The effective outcome of the potential filed based anomaly detection is filtering out all vessels behaving normally and presenting a set of anomalies, for a subsequent incident analysis using STRAND as an information visualization tool.","maritime traffic,potential field,anomaly detection,AIS,"
"debris slopes ventilation in the periglacial zone of the tatra mountains (poland and slovakia): the indicators","2012","This paper examines environmental indicators of debris slopes ventilation in the periglacial zone of the Tatra Mountains. Geomorphological and meteorological influences on ground surface temperature anomaly, hoarfrost, air ventilation funnels and snow melt windows, were analyzed as well as locations of long-lying snow and permafrost patches. The results show that debris slope ventilation is a common phenomenon occurring in different periods of the year. Its range is influenced mainly by substratum porosity (ground and snow cover), and the difference between the pressure inside and outside this medium (pore and atmospheric air temperature/dense; wind velocity). The height of the slope (‘chimney’) is less important. Some phenomena assumed to be evidences of slope ventilation are often connected with other factors influencing the thermal balance of the ground and the size of snow accumulation.","Tatra Mountains,Ground temperature,Debris slopes,Sporadic permafrost,Mountain environment,Air circulation,"

Although multiple probabilistic approaches have been implemented for explaining different parametric maritime phenomena, most of them are focused only on the analysis of primary kinematic data, such as position, speed, course of vessels, or lateral displacement relative to an obstacle. This article presents an analysis on multiple complex maritime activities (e.g., fishing, drifting, hidden activities) that were derived by processing AIS messages collected in the Black Sea region. Quantitative histograms were made for each type of activity while probability and cumulative distribution functions were plotted using kernel density estimation applications. After that, multiple evaluation metrics analysed the possibilities of representing these distributions in the form of known parametric distributions (e.g., Gaussian, Gamma, Rayleigh, Log-normal). Finally, there were extracted the parameters that best fitted these distributions.

"potential impact of long-life environmental sonobuoys on littoral asw","2009","The focus of military activity has recently shifted from large area engagements to regional conflicts. Consequently, supportive Naval maritime operations have continued to evolve toward littoral warfare in complicated shallow-water, near-shore environments. This evolution requires new sensors, advanced Concept of Operations, and improved data-analysis capabilities, among others. Planning operations in these harsh-environment areas is difficult because accurate predictions of tactical sensor performance depend on detailed knowledge of the local environmental conditions. Tactical mission planning is thus seldom optimal or efficient, often resulting in coverage gaps, increased risk, and reduced mission success. According to a Navy Mission Need Statement, 'Air ASW tactical execution, especially in littoral seas, requires in-situ environmental updates for preflight mission planning. In the conduct of ASW operations, an urgent need for explicit knowledge of environmental variables is required to optimize the effectiveness of operational acoustic sensors, as well as acoustic sensors in development ' The Naval Air Systems Command has considered extended-life environmental sonobuoy concepts to better characterize the littoral environment. Most designs contain a thermistor string to measure ocean temperatures and also hydrophones to measure ambient noise. This type of complex sonobuoy would be more expensive than a traditional single-measurement AXBT but it could provide a more thorough littoral environment assessment. This paper examines the trade-off between increased sensor complexity and improved ASW performance, in terms of cumulative detection probability. Some advantages of an extended-life combined thermistor string/hydrophone approach, compared to AXBTs and tactical hydrophones, are: 1) higher accuracy of the raw data; 2) temporal averaging to smooth out fluctuations; 3) extended area coverage during drift; 4) less chance for surface temperature anomalies (e.g., mixed-layer-depth errors) caused by various electronic and mechanical variability upon impact; 5) opportunities to discover thermal and acoustic feature boundaries during drift; and 6) less need to re-seed thus allowing longer tactical mission times. These advantages are evaluated relative to the following disadvantages: 1) increased cost; 2) potential drift outside the mission area; and 3) need for increased battery life for longer durations. The analysis is tempered by considering how a potential new system might be used. One assumption is that an environmental sampling decision aid is available to determine the minimum number and best initial locations of drifting sensors to meet performance objectives. The November 2007 Requirements Document from the Naval Oceanographic Office states ?Sampling guidance: Development of guidance on the best way to deploy, spatially and temporally, observation systems in order to meet various forecasting, model assimilation, and model evaluation objectives is needed.? Work in this area is reported in this Oceans '09 Conference in a paper entitled ?Uncertainty-based Adaptive AXBT Sampling with SPOTS?, which addresses optimal sampling requirements. For this trade-off analysis, temperature data from watersampling flights in the Sea of Japan off the east coast of Korea were used to simulate expected capability of a long-term drifting thermistor string. Then optimal initial positions for three notional buoys were determined followed by a simulation of drifting positions and data collected over 12 days. Ocean nowcasts were constructed and used to determine acoustic performance of a notional tactical sonobuoy field. The analysis shows that a drifting extended-life thermistor string can provide significant improvement in environmental characterization, tactical planning, and ASW detection performance.","Acoustic measurements,Sea measurements,military systems,Predictive models,Sonar equipment,Sampling methods,Ocean temperature,Noise measurement,littoral ASW,operational acoustic sensors,Thermistors,Temperature measurement,Acoustic sensors,long-life environmental sonobuoys,"

"aed-net: an abnormal event detection network","2019","It has long been a challenging task to detect an anomaly in a crowded scene. In this paper, a self-supervised framework called the abnormal event detection network (AED-Net), which is composed of a principal component analysis network (PCAnet) and kernel principal component analysis (kPCA), is proposed to address this problem. Using surveillance video sequences of different scenes as raw data, the PCAnet is trained to extract high-level semantics of the crowd’s situation. Next, kPCA, a one-class classifier, is trained to identify anomalies within the scene. In contrast to some prevailing deep learning methods, this framework is completely self-supervised because it utilizes only video sequences of a normal situation. Experiments in global and local abnormal event detection are carried out on Monitoring Human Activity dataset from University of Minnesota (UMN dataset) and Anomaly Detection dataset from University of California, San Diego (UCSD dataset), and competitive results that yield a better equal error rate (EER) and area under curve (AUC) than other state-of-the-art methods are observed. Furthermore, by adding a local response normalization (LRN) layer, we propose an improvement to the original AED-Net. The results demonstrate that this proposed version performs better by promoting the framework’s generalization capacity.","Kernel principal component analysis,Abnormal events detection,Principal component analysis network,Abnormal event detection network,"

Variants of the Mann-Kendall (MK) test considering influences of short-term persistence (STP), long-term persistence (LTP) and large-scale climate anomalies on trend detection were applied to detect trends, and the Pettitt test was used to evaluate change points. The results indicate that there was a mix of increasing and decreasing trends for Canadian AMPs and SMPs. Most regions in Pacific Maritime, central Boreal regions and the Atlantic Maritime showed an increase in AMP, while a decrease in Canadian Prairies and most Boreal regions. More stations showing statistically significant increases than decreases in spring, summer and autumn SMPs were found while there was a statistically significant decrease (increase) in winter SMP over southern (northern) Canada. LTP significantly increased the likelihood of trends detected in AMPs and SMPs. The effects of STP on the trend detection were also evident as shown by the differences in results obtained from the MK tests with and without considering the effect of STP. The effects of large-scale climate anomalies on trends were significant for winter SMPs. More than 1/4 of stations were detected with statistically significant change points in AMPs and SMPs which occurred around 1960–1990. More stations showed significant change points than trends, and winter showed more evident trends and change points in SMPs than other three seasons.

"anomalous accumulation of acid-volatile sulphides (avs) in a coastal marine sediment, saguenay fjord, canada","1995","Sulphate reduction usually leads to the formation and accumulation of authigenic pyrite (FeS2) in organic-rich coastal marine sediments. Iron monosulphides (FeSx) are most often found as a minor constituent of the reduced sulphur pool in these sediments and are believed to be precursor phases which convert to pyrite during early diagenesis. Abnormally high ratios of acid-volatile sulphides (AVS) to pyrite, however, are found in the sediments of the Saguenay Fjord, Canada. The AVS-S:FeS2S ratio observed throughout the anoxic zone in three sediment cores collected along the main axis of the fjord generally exceeds 1 and reaches values as high as 7 at the head of the fjord. To document and explain this anomaly, solid phase components (AVS, FeS2, S0, reactive iron (FeHCl), CORG, and total N) as well as porewater constituents (SO4, Fe, and Mn) were analyzed. Degree of pyritization (DOP) values were low (0.1–11%) and generally decreased toward the mouth of the fjord. In contrast, degree of sulphidization (DOS) estimates were high and reached values of up to 43% at the head of the fjord. These latter values indicate that pyrite formation is not limited by iron availability but a large excess of reactive iron may in fact inhibit the build-up of reduced sulphur (ΣH2S) in the porewaters as a result of AVS-S precipitation. In the absence of a strong ΣH2S gradient, slow diffusion to the redox boundary and limited formation of soluble intermediate reduced sulphur species may hinder the conversion of AVS to pyrite.",""
"identifying industrial heat sources using time-series of the viirs nightfire product with an object-oriented approach","2018","Carbon-based fuels burned at industrial facilities account for a large proportion of greenhouse gas emissions, and an up-to-date spatiotemporally detailed inventory is essential for a better understanding of global carbon emission patterns. The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Nightfire product offers a quantitative estimation of the temperatures of sub-pixel heat sources, providing the potential for detecting thermal anomalies from industrial sectors across the globe. However, identifying subcategories of various industrial heat sources is challenging because there are scarcely any stable and typical characteristics for their classification at a single thermal anomaly scale. Specifically, these nighttime thermal anomalies exhibit a strong spatiotemporal heterogeneity (e.g., fluctuations in retrieved temperature, spatial shifts in position, and presence of false positives), even in industrial heat sources that do not vary through time. Here, we demonstrate an object-oriented approach to robustly segment and accurately classify various industrial heat sources from a time-series of the VIIRS Nightfire product. The approach operates from the cluster level of spatially adjacent nighttime thermal anomalies (i.e., nighttime-heat-source objects rather than individual thermal anomalies) to generate fingerprint-like characteristics and to address the challenge of spatiotemporal heterogeneity. Specifically, the spatial-aggregation characteristic of nighttime thermal anomalies from continuously operating industrial heat sources and the temporal-aggregation characteristics of biomass burnings were incorporated to differentiate industrial nighttime-heat-source objects from ubiquitous biomass burnings. Subsequently, the similarity of the thermal signals of nighttime thermal anomalies from identical industrial heat sources was used to generate highly recognizable characteristics for their identification. A spatiotemporally detailed inventory of industrial heat sources across the globe was then established from this object-oriented classification. The inventory included a total of 15,199 industrial heat sources, representing 49.52% of all higher confidence nighttime thermal anomalies in the VIIRS Nightfire product. Validation of the results showed that only 218 objects (1.43%) were biomass burnings or active volcanoes that were misclassified as industrial heat sources. Further validation of sub-categories indicated an overall classification accuracy of ~77%. Our findings suggest that the VIIRS Nightfire product has great potential for monitoring the global distribution and dynamics of industrial heat sources, and combined with the object-oriented approach developed here the methodology is simple, robust, and cost-effective.","Nightfire product,Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS),Object-oriented analysis,Identification,Industrial heat sources,Time-series,"
"engine vibration anomaly detection in vessel engine room","2022","Unsupervised and autonomous operations require new, more efficient, and smarter technical solutions. Digitalization is one of the enablers of autonomous operation, with installing new sensors and using the data for AI and machine learning. The trend is to move the handling the vast amount of data from sensors, installed in machines, and devices, close to the sensors. This way, data communication can be heavily reduced, while the latency of decisions based on data can be minimal. This is achieved by moving the advanced data analysis capabilities from the cloud to the edge. In this paper, the driver of technological development is the concept of an unmanned machine room, where the normal inspections performed by personnel are automated using sensors and algorithms.We present an analysis of vibration data, recorded at a cruise ferry\x92s engines, using a signal processing method called cepstrums. A cepstrum is a version of frequency analysis, intending to identify and visualize periodic structures in data using cepstrograms. Compared to spectrogram analysis, usage of cepstrogram enables better visualization of engine behavior into the shape of audio signals. This helped us discover the run-time vibration routine of the engines from where we could observe unusual vibration sensing generated from the engine. We started studying the unusual behavior and came to the conclusion that the engine is sometimes misfiring the cylinders, generating anomalies","anomaly,unmanned machine room,edge computing,vibration analysis,cepstrum,data communication,autonomous operation,unsupervised,"
"ais event-based knowledge discovery for maritime situational awareness","2016","The discovery of anomalies and, more in general, of events of interest at sea is one of the main challenges of Maritime Situational Awareness. This paper introduces an event-based methodology for knowledge discovery without querying directly a large volume of raw data. The proposed architecture analyses the maritime traffic data to detect maritime traffic patterns and events and aggregate them in an Event Map, namely a georeferenced grid. The Event Map offers visualisation capabilities and, more importantly, is used as access interface to the maritime traffic knowledge database. The proposed methodology offers real-time access to the extracted maritime knowledge, and the possibility to perform more structured queries with respect to traditional basic queries (e. g. vessel proximity within a certain distance). The proposed approach is demonstrated and assessed using real-world Automatic Identification System (AIS) data, revealing computational improvements and enriched monitoring capabilities.","data mining,event detection,anomaly detection,Marine vehicles,Monitoring,data visualisation,data visualisation capabilities,event map,AIS event-based knowledge discovery,maritime situational awareness,data analysis,anomaly discovery,automatic identification system,Knowledge discovery,marine engineering,AIS,maritime surveillance,maritime traffic data analysis,maritime traffic knowledge database,georeferenced grid,Data visualization,Trajectory,Visualization,knowledge discovery,"
"maritime traffic network extraction and application based on ais data","2021","The paper presents a data-driven approach for maritime traffic network extraction based on Automatic Identification System (AIS) data. A maritime traffic network, consisting of nodes that represent waypoint areas and navigational legs, is constructed to represent the maritime traffic at a larger scale. The proposed maritime traffic network extraction approach consists of three phases: 1) extraction of maritime traffic motion patterns based on historical Automatic Identification System data; 2) enrich the ship trajectories with semantic information and each ship trajectory is abstracted as an â€œorigin-waypoint-destinationâ€ itinerary object; 3) ship itinerary objects are further merged into nodes and edges of a directed maritime traffic network. Based on the maritime traffic network, a hierarchical reasoning approach is proposed to associate a partially observed ship trajectory to the derived compatible ship routes and ship abnormal behaviour can be detected. The presented method can assist maritime authorities to improve the efficiency of maritime traffic surveillance and to develop strategies to improve navigation safety.","Image edge detection,Semantics,surveillance,Transportation,Anomaly detection,image motion analysis,maritime traffic motion patterns,marine navigation,Knowledge engineering,maritime authorities,ships,directed maritime traffic network,marine safety,partially observed ship trajectory,navigation safety,Weather forecasting,Ship motion pattern,marine engineering computing,Maritime traffic network,Trajectory,maritime traffic network extraction,traffic engineering computing,Navigation,maritime traffic surveillance,AIS data,historical automatic identification system data,"

"well water trace element reconnaissance, eastern maritime canada","1976","A geochemical survey involving the collection and analysis of about 2000 well water samples from an area of roughly 25,000 km2 was carried out during the 1975 field season over parts of the Carboniferous basin of eastern Canada. This report describes the results of 1721 regional well sites. Three samples of water were collected from each site and analyzed in four different laboratories for twenty constituents. The distribution and relationships of U, Rn, He F, CH4, Zn, Cu, Pb, Mn, Fe, pH, suspended matter, depth of well, conductivity and alkalinity are described. The elements U, Rn, He, F, along with conductivity and alkalinity, show systematic regional patterns indicating broad regional belts of element enrichment which are being leached by circulating groundwaters. The close spatial association of these elements over many tens of miles suggests chemical reaction cells or fronts similar to those observed in the uranium mining districts of Colorado and Wyoming in the United States and elsewhere. Their relatively weak character suggests an intermediate cycle in the cyclic enrichment hypothesis believed to be responsible for the formation of epigenetic uranium ore deposits. The heavy elements Zn, Cu, Pb, Mn, and Fe show positive correlation with each other but their spatial distribution is more spotty than that of the uranium elements. Broadly speaking the anomalies of these elements cluster mainly on the southern border of the survey area. Most of the anomalies can be explained in terms of known mineral occurrences The most prominent CH4 anomaly is located south of Moncton and is believed to be due to the old St. Josephs gas and oil field. Several weaker CH4 anomalies are probably generated by swamps and peat bogs.",""
"efficient on-line anomaly detection for ship systems in operation","2019","We propose novel modifications to an anomaly detection methodology based on multivariate signal reconstruction followed by residuals analysis. The reconstructions are made using Auto Associative Kernel Regression (AAKR), where the query observations are compared to historical observations called memory vectors, representing normal operation. When the data set with historical observations grows large, the naive approach where all observations are used as memory vectors will lead to unacceptable large computational loads, hence a reduced set of memory vectors should be intelligently selected. The residuals between the observed and the reconstructed signals are analysed using standard Sequential Probability Ratio Tests (SPRT), where appropriate alarms are raised based on the sequential behaviour of the residuals. The modifications we introduce include: a novel cluster based method to select memory vectors to be considered by the AAKR, which gives an extensive reduction in computation time; a generalization of the distance measure, which makes it possible to distinguish between explanatory and response variables; and a regional credibility estimation used in the residuals analysis, to let the time used to identify if a sequence of query vectors represents an anomalous state or not, depend on the amount of data situated close to or surrounding the query vector. We demonstrate how the anomaly detection method and the proposed modifications can be successfully applied for anomaly detection on a set of imbalanced benchmark data sets, as well as on recent data from a marine diesel engine in operation.","Cluster based AAKR,Maritime industry,Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT),Anomaly detection,Auto Associative Kernel Regression (AAKR),Condition monitoring,"
"forecasting the impact of an 1859-calibre superstorm on satellite resources","2006","We have developed simple models to assess the economic impacts to the current satellite resource caused by the worst-case scenario of a hypothetical superstorm event occurring during the next sunspot cycle. Although the consequences may be severe, our worse-case scenario does not include the complete failure of the entire 937 operating satellites in the current population, which have a replacement value of ∼$170–230 billion, and supporting a ∼$90 billion/year industry. Our estimates suggest a potential economic loss of <$70 billion for lost revenue (∼$44 billion) and satellite replacement for GEO satellites (∼$24 billion) caused by a ‘once a century’ single storm similar to the 1859 superstorm. We estimate that 80 satellites (LEO, MEO, and GEO) may be disabled as a consequence of a superstorm event. Additional impacts may include the failure of many of the GPS, GLONASS, and Galileo satellite systems in MEO. Approximately 97 LEO satellites, which normally would not have re-entered for many decades, may prematurely de-orbit by ca 2021 as a result of the temporarily increased atmospheric drag caused by a superstorm event occurring in ca. 2012. The $100 billion International Space Station may lose significant altitude, placing it in critical need for re-boosting by an amount potentially outside the range of typical Space Shuttle operations, which are in any case scheduled to end in 2010. Currently, the ability to forecast extreme particle events and coronal mass ejections, or predict their fluences and geoseverity in the 24-h prior to the event, appears to be no better than 50/50. Our analysis of economic impacts is a first attempt at estimation whose approach will suggest ways in which better estimates may eventually be obtained.","Satellite anomalies,Radiation sickness,Technology impacts,Satellite failures,Space weather,Superstorms,Economic impacts,"

"system architecture for real-time condition monitoring and anomaly detection on ships","2023","Sea-based rescue organizations play a vital role in maritime civil security by resolving offshore emergencies, securing sea routes, and monitoring critical naval infrastructure. However, increasing marine traffic makes rescue operations more difficult, demanding better organization and orchestration of available resources. Therefore, ensuring efficient maintenance, availability and timely deployment of rescue cruisers is of great importance, particularly in rough sea conditions. To achieve this, we design an AI-based system for predictive maintenance and condition monitoring that enables real-time analyses of the shipâ€™s sensory data and the detection of anomalies in the system behavior. In this paper, we detail our software and hardware architecture for these purposes, and we discuss the respective requirements regarding onboard and off-ship data analysis from various data sources (sensor data, camera data, weather data). We underpin our approach by emulating data flows derived from sensory data. Finally, we provide the first results in AI-based anomaly detection, allowing, for instance, early engine malfunctions identification before the actual failure occurs.","Machine Learning,Condition Monitoring,Computer architecture,Systems architecture,Soft sensors,Real-time systems,Anomaly Detection,Ship Sensory Data,Condition monitoring,System Architecture,Organizations,Hardware,"
"multi-label classification for ais data anomaly detection using wavelet transform","2022","Thanks to the Automatic Identification System (AIS), ships and other maritime equipment are able to communicate with each other, for example, by sending information about their position. This solution allows for early collision detection when two or more ships are on a collision course. In the newer version of AIS, a satellite infrastructure is used to extend the communication range. Unfortunately, satellite AIS deals with so-called packet collision effect: since there is a problem with synchronizing AIS data coming from multiple terrestrial areas, a single satellite may receive several AIS messages at the same time and be unable to correctly process them, causing the data to get lost or garbled. In this article, a machine learning based framework for detecting the incorrect AIS data is presented. In this approach, after the first stage (clustering), a dedicated anomaly detection algorithm searches for damaged AIS messages and conducts multi-label classification (with Random Forest and wavelet transform) to decide which fields of such message requires further correction. The results of measuring the effectiveness of the proposed approach using real AIS data are presented.","telecommunication security,Clustering algorithms,incorrect AIS data,single satellite,Anomaly detection,Wavelet transforms,anomaly detection,random forests,collision course,Marine vehicles,Machine learning,damaged AIS messages,Data analysis,dedicated anomaly detection algorithm searches,satellite communication,ships,wavelet transform,pattern classification,random forest,Classification algorithms,multiple terrestrial areas,pattern clustering,machine learning based framework,Artificial intelligence,multi-label classification,multilabel classification,wavelet transforms,satellite infrastructure,AIS data anomaly detection,maritime equipment,communication range,Trajectory,marine communication,Labeling,early collision detection,AIS data analysis,packet collision effect,satellite AIS deals,"

The neural network provides a new means to capture complex and heterogeneous patterns in vesselsâ€™ behaviours, while the a contrario detector takes into account the fact that the learnt distribution may be location-dependent.

"leveraging graph and deep learning uncertainties to detect anomalous maritime trajectories","2022","Understanding and representing traffic patterns are key to detecting anomalous trajectories in the transportation domain. However, some trajectories can exhibit heterogeneous maneuvering characteristics despite confining to normal patterns. Thus, we propose a novel graph-based trajectory representation and association scheme for extraction and confederation of traffic movement patterns, such that data patterns and uncertainty can be learned by deep learning (DL) models. This paper proposes the usage of a recurrent neural network (RNN)-based evidential regression model, which can predict trajectory at future timesteps as well as estimate the data and model uncertainties associated, to detect anomalous maritime trajectories, such as unusual vessel maneuvering, using automatic identification system (AIS) data. Furthermore, we utilize evidential deep learning classifiers to detect unusual turns of vessels and the loss of transmitted signal using predicted class probabilities with associated uncertainties. Our experimental results suggest that the graphical representation of traffic patterns improves the ability of the DL models, such as evidential and Monte Carlo dropout, to learn the temporal-spatial correlation of data and associated uncertainties. Using different datasets and experiments, we demonstrate that the estimated prediction uncertainty yields fundamental information for the detection of traffic anomalies in the maritime and, possibly in other domains.","Monte Carlo methods,classification,recurrent neural nets,graph,deep learning (artificial intelligence),Anomaly detection,DL models,graph-based trajectory representation,automatic identification system data,Monte Carlo dropout,graphical representation,traffic movement patterns,detect anomalous maritime trajectories,Predictive models,regression analysis,evidential deep learning,marine engineering,Data models,data patterns,pattern classification,Artificial intelligence,graph theory,RNN,regression,clustering,uncertainty,Trajectory,Uncertainty,probability,Computational modeling,traffic engineering computing,recurrent neural network-based evidential regression model,deep learning uncertainties,AIS data,"
"technologies to aid decision making for maritime security","2012","The paper presents 3 key technologies used in an integrated maritime reasoning and monitoring system [1]. These technologies fuse maritime data for decision support in the martime security domain. They support monitoring of scenarios of interest such as terrorist attacks or piracy incidents, and alert operators when such scenarios are assessed likely to happen. These 3 technologies are: a. Dynamic Bayesian Reasoning & Advanced Intelligent Networks (D'Brain), a reasoning system based on Bayesian networks. Causal and probabilistic information about scenarios of interest are structured as Bayesian networks, in which variables are set according to the interpretation of incoming situation information. The system thus provides a systematic approach to modelling and monitoring for scenarios of interest in the maritime situation. b. Graylist Ranking, a ranking technique to order entities based on their structural relationship with black-listed entities. The ranked list of entities could then be used to prioritize further investigation efforts into higher ranking entities which are considered more suspicious. c. Trajectory Analysis using a nonparametric Bayesian model, Dual Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes (Dual-HDP) [2]. It models the activity patterns (norm) of entities in motion.

"a generic anomaly detection approach applied to mixture-of-unigrams and maritime surveillance data","2019","This paper proposes a new generic method to detect anomalies (i.e., statistical outliers) which can be used with a generative topic model. In this paper, we specify this method in the context of the Mixture-of-unigrams model, which is widely used in text mining. It is possible to detect anomalies with a topic model by applying a threshold to the likelihood. However, it is challenging to choose the threshold since the choice needs to consider both the similarities of the topics and the length of documents. This paper describes a new intuitive method to detect anomalies which simply manipulates the output of the trained model. Such an approach is anticipated to have parameters that are more intuitive to define for a given problem. To assess the utility of the proposed approach, we also present a use case involving identifying ships misreporting their ship-type using geo-location data from the Automatic Identification System (AIS) messages. We show that, if we train a model using data for one type of ship, it is possible to identify ships of another type as anomalous.","geo-location data,data mining,Anomaly detection,Mixture-of-unigrams model,Marine vehicles,natural language processing,security of data,trained model,generic anomaly detection,ships,automatic identification system,marine engineering,text mining,generative topic model,Training data,Data models,statistical outliers,intuitive method,Artificial intelligence,Training,text analysis,Probability,maritime surveillance data,learning (artificial intelligence),"
