"data-driven prognostics using a combination of constrained k-means clustering, fuzzy modeling and lof-based score","2017","Today, failure modes characterization and early detection is a key issue in complex assets. This is due to the negative impact of corrective operations and the conservative strategies usually put in practice, focused on preventive maintenance. In this paper anomaly detection issue is addressed in new monitoring sensor data by characterizing and modeling operational behaviors. The learning framework is performed on the basis of a machine learning approach that combines constrained K-means clustering for outlier detection and fuzzy modeling of distances to normality. A final score is also calculated over time, considering the membership degree to resulting fuzzy sets and a local outlier factor. Proposed solution is deployed in a CBM+ platform for online monitoring of the assets. In order to show the validity of the approach, experiments have been conducted on real operational faults in an auxiliary marine diesel engine. Experimental results show a fully comprehensive yet accurate prognostics approach, improving detection capabilities and knowledge management. The performance achieved is quite high (precision, sensitivity and specificity above 93% and κ=0.93), even more so given that a very small percentage of real faults are present in data.","Local outlier factor,Constrained k-means clustering,Behavior characterization,Machine learning,Fuzzy modeling,Condition monitoring,"
"analysis of terrain attributes in different spatial resolutions for digital soil mapping application in southeastern brazil","2020","Terrain attributes are used as auxiliary variables in spatial prediction of soil classes and properties, due to their important role in the pedogenetic process and the increasing availability of digital elevation models (DEMs) in different resolutions. This work analyzed the effect of the different spatial resolutions of the DEMs and attributes derived from terrain and their implications for application in DSM predictive models. We used three spatial resolutions from different DEMs: (1) LIDAR – 2 m; (2) ALOS PALSAR – 12.5 and 30 m; (3) SRTM – 30 m; and (4) ASTER GDEM – 30 m. Multivariate analyses were performed determined by the Pearson linear correlation coefficient (r), the K-means cluster analysis, and the principal component analysis (PCA). The prediction of soil classes was performed using the terrain attributes grouped as to sensitivity to resolution, for different spatial resolutions, applying the machine learning algorithms Random Forest and Support Vector Machine. The cluster analysis indicated that most attributes remained within the same group of resolution sensitivity with changes in the cell size of reference DEM. The attributes of the terrain grouped low sensitive to resolution derived from the SRTM DEM showed better precision and the main advantage was the low cost and facilitating computational processing for application in the DSM.","Machine learning,Multivariate analysis,Digital elevation model,Morphometry,"
"maritime ship detection method for satellite images based on multiscale feature fusion","2023","Remote sensing ship recognition technology is one of the important research areas for achieving ocean security monitoring. However, maritime ship targets features such as multiscale, arbitrary direction, and dense arrangement, and their imaging is often influenced by factors such as sea fog and sea surface background. It is challenging for fast and accurate detection of remote sensing ships. We propose a new ship detection algorithm YOLO-remote sensing ship detection (YOLO-RSSD) based on YOLOv5, which effectively improves the accuracy of ship detection while ensuring detection speed. It is attributed to our proposed four optimization measures in this model. First, the K-means++ algorithm is introduced in the data preprocessing part to improve the clustering effect and obtain candidate box sizes suitable for multiscale ship dataset. Then, an improved bidirectional feature pyramid network structure is embedded in the feature fusion part to achieve cross-layer multiscale weighted feature fusion. Third, the original bounding box regression loss function is replaced with the EIoU loss, which is effective for accelerating the convergence and improving the regression accuracy of predicted boxes. Finally, a channel attention mechanism is introduced in the convolutional unit to enhance the model's ability to capture ship features. Experimental results show that the YOLO-RSSD model achieves a detection accuracy of 96.1% for remote sensing ships, which is 4.3% higher than the original YOLOv5 network. In addition, YOLO-RSSD performs good robustness and generalization ability. This means that our method has high practical value and provides a new solution for the analysis and application of remote sensing images.","detection speed,sea surface background,YOLO-RSSD model,Remote sensing,cross-layer multiscale weighted feature fusion,remote sensing,ship detection,Adaptively spatial feature fusion,Marine vehicles,ship features,multiscale ship dataset,Feature extraction,channel attention mechanism,improved bidirectional feature pyramid network structure,regression analysis,geophysical image processing,candidate box sizes,detection accuracy,Target recognition,Optical sensors,ships,original bounding box regression loss function,remote sensing ship recognition technology,Image recognition,remote sensing images,object detection,feature extraction,image classification,small target detection,optical satellite remote sensing image,ship detection algorithm YOLO-remote sensing ship detection,convolutional unit,YOLOv5,feature fusion part,convolutional neural nets,multiscale feature fusion,fast detection,arbitrary direction,Object detection,maritime ship detection method,sea fog,"
"detection of invalid ais messages using machine learning techniques","2022","Coastal nations monitor maritime activities in the interest of defence, security, and safety. This form of monitoring typically occurs at operations centers that visualize the maritime environment by creating a Recognized Maritime Picture (RMP) covering a particular area of interest. The creation of this picture changed drastically with the introduction of the Automatic Identification System (AIS). AIS messages are known to contain numerous types of errors and in April 2020 a unique error was found in the data stream. This error consisted of messages indicating the appearance of over 200 vessels in the North Atlantic taking part in a yacht race when in fact no race or physical ships existed. The following work explores the application of various machine learning (ML) techniques to help identify these types of fabricated AIS messages. Specific ML techniques were explored including: K-means clustering, Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Feed-Forward Neural Networks (FNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and One-Class Support Vector Machines (One-SVM). The results showed that DT, RF, and FNN best identified the fabricated AIS messages with F1 scores greater than 93 percent on the test data.","maritime domain awareness,AIS,automatic identification system,machine learning,"
"vessel sailing patterns analysis from s-ais data dased on k-means clustering algorithm","2019","Automatic Identification System (AIS) provides abundant near real-time information of moving vessels in the sea of the whole world and has been widely used in the fields of vessel collision avoidance, Maritime Situation Awareness (MSA) and ocean surveillance. The development of satellite-based AIS further expands the range of AIS and enables a wide converge of AIS data collection, which solves the problem of lacking AIS data in high-seas. At the same time, AIS data provides a rich source for data mining for maritime traffic analysis. In this paper, a typical clustering algorithm called K-means is applied to deal with the Space-based AIS(S-AIS) data received by â€œTianTuo-3â€ satellite developed by National University of Defense Technology. We use Elbow Rule to determine the optimal number of clusters and calculate the normalized standard deviation of COG(Course Over Ground) and SOG(Speed Over Ground) of vessels in south Africa area as their features to conduct clustering. This method is supposed to evaluate vessels' sailing stability and used in detection of low-likelihood behaviors or anomalies of vessels.","SOG,surveillance,data mining,Clustering algorithms,vessel behavior,Marine vehicles,vessel collision avoidance,AIS data collection,ocean surveillance,TianTuo-3 satellite,elbow rule,speed over ground,space-based AIS ata,ships,satellite-based AIS,marine safety,K-means,marine engineering,automatic identification system,vessel anomaly,Elbow,k-means clustering algorithm,vessel sailing patterns analysis,pattern clustering,COG,Artificial intelligence,maritime traffic analysis,Satellite broadcasting,South Africa,course over ground,Trajectory,national security,artificial satellites,clustering algorithm,Data mining,normalized standard deviation,Maritime traffic analysis,Space-based AIS,S-AIS data,"
"energy harvesting space-air-sea integrated networks for mec-enabled maritime internet of things","2022","In recent years, various maritime applications such as unmanned surface vehicles, marine environment monitoring, target tracking, and emergency response have developed rapidly in maritime communication networks (MCNs), and these applications are often accompanied by complex computation tasks and low latency requirements. However, due to the limited resources of the vessels, it is critical to design an efficient mobile edge computing (MEC) enabled network for maritime computation. Inspired by this motivation, energy harvesting space-air-sea integrated networks (EH-SASINs) for maritime computation tasks offloading are proposed in this paper. We first make the optimal deployment of tethered aerostats (TAs) with the K-means method. In addition, we study the issue of computation task offloading for vessels, focusing on minimizing the process delay of computation task based on the proposed architecture. Finally, because of the NP-hard properties of the optimization problem, we solve it in two stages and propose an improved water-filling algorithm based on queuing theory. Simulation results show that the proposed EH-SASINs and algorithms outperform the existing scenarios and can reduce about 50% of the latency compared with local computation.","Satellites,efficient mobile edge computing,computation offloading,MEC-enabled maritime Internet,remotely operated vehicles,Delays,computation task,EH-SASINs,local computation,target tracking,Space vehicles,energy harvesting space-air-sea integrated networks,marine safety,Servers,cellular radio,complex computation tasks,optimisation,mobile computing,Low earth orbit satellites,Computer architecture,MEC,maritime applications,maritime computation tasks,unmanned surface vehicles,marine environment monitoring,marine communication,maritime communication networks,Task analysis,energy harvesting,resource allocation,MCNs,"
"k-means clustering algorithms: a comprehensive review, variants analysis, and advances in the era of big data","2023","Advances in recent techniques for scientific data collection in the era of big data allow for the systematic accumulation of large quantities of data at various data-capturing sites. Similarly, exponential growth in the development of different data analysis approaches has been reported in the literature, amongst which the K-means algorithm remains the most popular and straightforward clustering algorithm. The broad applicability of the algorithm in many clustering application areas can be attributed to its implementation simplicity and low computational complexity. However, the K-means algorithm has many challenges that negatively affect its clustering performance. In the algorithm’s initialization process, users must specify the number of clusters in a given dataset apriori while the initial cluster centers are randomly selected. Furthermore, the algorithm's performance is susceptible to the selection of this initial cluster and for large datasets, determining the optimal number of clusters to start with becomes complex and is a very challenging task. Moreover, the random selection of the initial cluster centers sometimes results in minimal local convergence due to its greedy nature. A further limitation is that certain data object features are used in determining their similarity by using the Euclidean distance metric as a similarity measure, but this limits the algorithm’s robustness in detecting other cluster shapes and poses a great challenge in detecting overlapping clusters. Many research efforts have been conducted and reported in literature with regard to improving the K-means algorithm’s performance and robustness. The current work presents an overview and taxonomy of the K-means clustering algorithm and its variants. The history of the K-means, current trends, open issues and challenges, and recommended future research perspectives are also discussed.","Clustering algorithm,Modified k-means,Perspectives on big data clustering,Improved k-means,Big data clustering,K-means,K-means variants,"
