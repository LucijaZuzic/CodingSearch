"fast cnn surveillance pipeline for fine-grained vessel classification and detection in maritime scenarios","2016","Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have proven very effective for many vision benchmarks in object detection and classification tasks. However, the computational complexity and object resolution requirements of CNNs limit their applicability in wide-view video surveillance settings where objects are small. This paper presents a CNN surveillance pipeline for vessel localization and classification in maritime video. The proposed pipeline is build upon the GPU implementation of Fast-R-CNN with three main steps:(1) Vessel filtering and regions proposal using low-cost weak object detectors based on hand-engineered features. (2) Deep CNN features of the candidates regions are computed with one feed-forward pass from the high-level layer of a fine-tuned VGG16 network. (3) Fine-grained classification is performed using CNN features and a support vector machine classifier with linear kernel for object verification. The performance of the proposed pipeline is compared with other popular CNN architectures with respect to detection accuracy and evaluation speed. The proposed approach mAP of 61.10% was the comparable with Fast-R-CNN but with a 10Ã— speed up (on the order of Faster-R-CNN) on the new Annapolis Maritime Surveillance Dataset.","Pipelines,Support vector machines,object verification,Feature extraction,maritime video,maritime scenarios,neural nets,GPU,linear kernel,fine-grained vessel detection,fine-grained vessel classification,support vector machines,deep convolutional neural networks,pipelines,Proposals,object detection,image classification,feed-forward pass,support vector machine classifier,fast-R-CNN,Object detection,Surveillance,fast CNN surveillance pipeline,VGG16 network,Detectors,Annapolis maritime surveillance dataset,"

"maritime situation analysis framework: vessel interaction classification and anomaly detection","2015","Maritime domain awareness is critical for protecting sea lanes, ports, harbors, offshore structures like oil and gas rigs and other types of critical infrastructure against common threats and illegal activities. Typical examples range from smuggling of drugs and weapons, human trafficking and piracy all the way to terror attacks. Limited surveillance resources constrain maritime domain awareness and compromise full security coverage at all times. This situation calls for innovative intelligent systems for interactive situation analysis to assist marine authorities and security personal in their routine surveillance operations. In this article, we propose a novel situation analysis approach to analyze marine traffic data and differentiate various scenarios of vessel engagement for the purpose of detecting anomalies of interest for marine vessels that operate over some period of time in relative proximity to each other. We consider such scenarios as probabilistic processes and analyze complex vessel trajectories using machine learning to model common patterns. Specifically, we represent patterns as left-to-right Hidden Markov Models and classify them using Support Vector Machines. To differentiate suspicious activities from unobjectionable behavior, we explore fusion of data and information, including kinematic features, geospatial features, contextual information and maritime domain knowledge. Our experimental evaluation shows the effectiveness of the proposed approach using comprehensive real-world vessel tracking data from coastal waters of North America.","Kinematics,surveillance,hidden Markov models,interactive situation analysis,Hidden Markov models,Geospatial analysis,anomaly detection,Anomaly Detection,maritime domain awareness,marine traffic data analysis,data fusion,information fusion,data analysis,Maritime Domain Awareness,vessel engagement,routine surveillance operations,marine engineering,support vector machines,kinematic features,probabilistic processes,geospatial features,machine learning,left-to-right hidden Markov models,vessel interaction classification,innovative intelligent systems,pattern classification,contextual information,Time series analysis,maritime situation analysis framework,Critical Infrastructure Protection,Big Data,vessel tracking data,Trajectory,Machine Learning,probability,complex vessel trajectory analysis,pattern representation,traffic engineering computing,Surveillance,maritime domain knowledge,marine vehicles,Intelligent Systems,learning (artificial intelligence),Security,security,"
"on the effectiveness of ai-assisted anomaly detection methods in maritime navigation","2020","The automatic identification system (AIS) has become an essential tool for maritime security. Nevertheless, how to effectively use the static and dynamic voyage information of the AIS data in maritime traffic situation awareness is still a challenge. This paper presents a comparative study of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques on their effectiveness in dealing with various anomalies in maritime domain using the AIS data. The AIS on-off switching (OOS) anomaly is critical in maritime security, since AIS technology is susceptible to manipulation and it can be switched on and off to hide illegal activities. Thus, we try to detect and distinguish between intentional and non-intentional AIS OOS anomalies through our AI -assisted anomaly detection framework. We use AIS data, in particular positional and navigational status of vessels, to study the effectiveness of seven AI techniques, such as artificial neural network, support vector machine, logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, decision tree, random forest and naive Bayes, in detecting the AIS OOS anomalies. Our experimental results show that ANN and SVM are the most suitable techniques in detecting the AIS OOS anomalies with 99.9% accuracy. Interestingly, the ANN model outperforms others when trained with a balanced (i.e., same order of samples per class) dataset, and SVM, on the other hand, is suitable when training dataset is unbalanced.","maritime traffic situation awareness,AI-assisted anomaly detection,decision trees,Support vector machines,logistic regression,Anomaly detection,static voyage information,random forests,ANN,marine navigation,Feature extraction,security of data,maritime security,k-nearest neighbors,regression analysis,AIS technology,naive Bayes,neural nets,naive Bayes methods,automatic identification system,marine safety,marine engineering,support vector machines,maritime navigation,dynamic voyage information,maritime domain,random forest,SVM,Artificial intelligence,AIS on-off switching anomaly,nearest neighbour methods,artificial neural network,Training,Trajectory,support vector machine,nonintentional AIS OOS anomalies,Navigation,artificial intelligence,decision tree,AIS data,"
"a comparative investigation of data-driven approaches based on one-class classifiers for condition monitoring of marine machinery system","2020","The safety and reliability of ship navigation depend heavily on the performance of the marine machinery system, which can be maintained at a high level by condition based maintenance. Intelligent condition monitoring is the key to achieve condition based maintenance. However, it is not easy to realize intelligent condition monitoring in a real ship, because there are not enough labeled fault samples to train an accurate detection model. In fact, the potential value of a large number of normal samples collected by the shipboard monitoring system has not been mined out. Since one-class classifiers only need one-class samples to train the detection models, they are very suitable for such occasions. In this paper, we investigate the performance of several representative one-class classifiers, such as OCSVM (One class support vector machine), SVDD (Support vector data description), GKNN (Global k-nearest neighbors), LOF (Local outlier factor), IForest (Isolation forest) and ABOD (Angle-based outlier detection), in condition monitoring of the marine machinery system. The dataset of a marine gas turbine propulsion system is used for a case study, which is a simulation dataset verified by the real ship data. Compared with previous literatures, our new work is to investigate the performance of a variety of key one-class classifiers, not only considering the common evaluation indexes for machine learning, but also considering the sample combinations of the training dataset, distribution of misclassified samples, and the tolerance to contaminated data. The experimental results show that these algorithms have good performance in the dataset in some common evaluation indexes. However, they show some obvious performance differences in some novel evaluation indexes we proposed. This can provide decision support for the application of one-class classifiers in the condition monitoring of many other marine machinery systems.","One-class classifier,Marine machinery,Condition based maintenance,Condition monitoring,"
"an automated treatment plan alert system to safeguard cancer treatments in radiation therapy","2022","In radiation oncology, the intricate process of delivering radiation to a patient is detailed by the patient’s treatment plan, which is data describing the geometry, construction and strength of the radiation machine and the radiation beam it emits. The patient’s life depends upon the accuracy of the treatment plan, which is left in the hands of the vendor-specific software automatically generating the plan after an initial patient consultation and planning with a medical professional. However, corrupted and erroneous treatment plan data have previously resulted in severe patient harm when errors go undetected and radiation proceeds. The aim of this paper is to develop an automatic error-checking system to prevent the accidental delivery of radiation treatment to an area of the human body (i.e., the treatment site) that differs from the plan’s documented intended site. To this end, we develop a method for structuring treatment plan data in order to feed machine-learning (ML) classifiers and predict a plan’s treatment site. In practice, a warning may be raised if the prediction disagrees with the documented intended site. The contribution of this paper is in the strategic structuring of the complex, intricate, and nonuniform data of modern treatment planning and from multiple vendors in order to easily train ML algorithms. A three-step process utilizing up- and down-sampling and dimension reduction, the method we develop in this paper reduces the thousands of parameters comprising a single treatment plan to a single two-dimensional heat map that is independent of the specific vendor or construction of the machine used for treatment. Our heat-map structure lends itself well to feed well-established ML algorithms, and we train–test random forest, softmax, k-nearest neighbors, shallow neural network, and support vector machine using real clinical treatment plans from several hospitals in the United States. The paper demonstrates that the proposed method characterizes treatment sites so well that ML classifiers may predict head-neck, breast, and prostate treatment sites with an accuracy of about 94%. The proposed method is the first step towards a thorough, fully automated error-checking system in radiation therapy.","Radiation heat map,Nonuniform treatment data,Cancer classification,"

"the usefulness of artificial intelligence for safety assessment of different transport modes","2023","Recent research in transport safety focuses on the processing of large amounts of available data by means of intelligent systems, in order to decrease the number of accidents for transportation users. Several Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications have been developed to address safety problems and improve efficiency of transportation systems. However exchange of knowledge between transport modes has been limited. This paper reviews the ML and AI methods used in different transport modes (road, rail, maritime and aviation) to address safety problems, in order to identify good practices and experiences that can be transferable between transport modes. The methods examined include statistical and econometric methods, algorithmic approaches, classification and clustering methods, artificial neural networks (ANN) as well as optimization and dimension reduction techniques. Our research reveals the increasing interest of transportation researchers and practitioners in AI applications for crash prediction, incident/failure detection, pattern identification, driver/operator or route assistance, as well as optimization problems. The most popular and efficient methods used in all transport modes are ANN, SVM, Hidden Markov Models and Bayesian models. The type of the analytical technique is mainly driven by the purpose of the safety analysis performed. Finally, a wider variety of AI and ML methodologies is observed in road transport mode, which also appears to concentrate a higher, and constantly increasing, number of studies compared to the other modes.","Machine Learning,Transportation Modes,Transportation Safety,Artificial Intelligence,"
"w-band maritime target classification using high resolution range profiles","2013","A W-band radar model was developed and tested using six point-scatterer maritime targets to assess the performance of four classifiers: traditional maximum correlation, naÃ¯ve Bayes, polynomial kernel support vector machine (SVM) and radial basis function (RBF) SVM. W-band is characterized by scintillations caused by subtle aspect and range changes, making classification potentially problematic. High resolution range profiles (HRRPs) were used as the feature vectors with minimal pre-processing. Training and test datasets were generated by rotating the targets in the azimuth plane. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was conducted, as well as precision, recall, and accuracy measures derived, and confusion matrices obtained for each classifier under a specific operating point. It was found that the traditional correlation approach performed best under the given circumstances, closely followed by the two SVM approaches and naÃ¯ve Bayes. It was also found that different classifiers were better suited to classifying particular targets.","classification,maritime,W-band maritime target classification,Kernel,RBF SVM,Support vector machines,radial basis function,scintillation,W-band radar model,HRRPs,W-band,Accuracy,ROC analysis,Polynomials,six point-scatterer maritime targets,correlation approach,radar computing,support vector machines,radar,training datasets,pattern classification,maximum correlation classifiers,Correlation,naÃ¯ve Bayes classifiers,Radar,millimetre wave radar,high resolution range profiles,radar resolution,feature vectors,Signal to noise ratio,radial basis function networks,test datasets,confusion matrices,ATR,scintillations,polynomial kernel support vector machine,receiver operating characteristic analysis,"
"maritime automated targets recognition algorithm test bed for high resolution isar imagery","2013","A maritime automatic target recognition system is under development to perform ship classification using images from inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) systems. This work will describe the algorithm framework for feature extraction, classification, and aim-point recognition. ISAR systems produce two-dimensional images of ships from the periodic motion inherent to all maritime objects and can be used to distinguish objects of interest for Homeland Security. There is a need for real-time classification of these objects. This work extends the state of the art in two ways: One - current maritime classification focuses on satellite ISAR, creating latency for classification[1]; and Two - work with Homeland Security ISAR radar systems is focused on concealed weapon detection [2,3]. This work uses localized ISAR images from stationary radars to classify maritime objects. Since the aspect and cross-range scale factor are continually changing, ISAR images form distinct representations unique to each object under observation. These distinct representations are analogous to visual images in many ways. They have unique shapes and areas of strong return, much in the same way objects in passive images have unique sizes and colors. However, ISAR images are synthetic portrayals of scattered field data from active sensor RF sensors whereas visual images are observations of passive sensors. This distinction must be a considered as a design constraint in the classification system - each feature employed must be exhaustively examined regarding its physical counterpart. Within that constraint, ISAR synthetic imagery feature extraction techniques can leverage from previous work developed for passive sensors. This is especially the case of High Range Resolution (HRR) ISAR systems. After extraction from ISAR prototype images, a set of representative features will be used to train a support vector machine (SVM) classifier, a supervised learning model capable of pattern recognition.","marine radar,active sensor,Inverse synthetic aperture radar,image motion analysis,Marine vehicles,Feature extraction,image colour analysis,supervised learning model,Target recognition,periodic motion,ships,radar computing,marine engineering,support vector machines,2D ship images,object detection,automated target recognition,synthetic aperture radar,feature extraction,image classification,maritime automated target recognition algorithm test bed,high range resolution ISAR imagery,RF sensors,Classification algorithms,SVM,homeland security ISAR radar systems,radar imaging,support vector machine classifier,Doppler effect,high resolution,Image segmentation,concealed weapon detection,weapons,satellite ISAR system,aim-point recognition,inverse synthetic aperture radar systems,stationary radars,Image resolution,national security,maritime object classification,image sensors,ship classification,learning (artificial intelligence),pattern recognition,passive sensors,object recognition,oceanographic techniques,"

"eeg-based cadets training and performance assessment system in maritime virtual simulator","2018","Deep investment in the maritime industries has led to many cutting edge technological advances in shipping navigation and operational safety to ensure safe and efficient logistical transportations. However, even with the best technology equipped onboard, maritime accidents are still occurring with at least three quarters of them attributed to human errors. Due to the rising need to address the human factors in shipping operations, various human factors studies are conducted in maritime domain. In this paper, an Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based cadets training and performance assessment system is proposed and implemented that could be used in the maritime virtual simulator. The system includes an EEG processing and analyses part and an evaluation part. It could recognize the brain states such as mental workload, emotions, and stress from raw EEG signal recorded during the exercises in the simulator and then give an indicative recommendation on 'pass', 'retrain', or 'fail' of the cadet based on the EEG recognition results and input of the level of the task difficulty performed.","medical signal processing,safe transportations,Electroencephalography,human errors,Support vector machines,logistical transportations,assessment,Feature extraction,human factors,EEG signal,shipping navigation,operational safety,ships,marine safety,marine engineering,electroencephalogram-based cadets training,Emotion recognition,Stress,EEG,EEG-based cadets training,Training,maritime training,Task analysis,maritime accidents,maritime simulator,maritime virtual simulator,maritime industries,performance assessment system,electroencephalography,"
"seaâ€“land segmentation in maritime surveillance radars via k-nearest neighbor classifier","2020","Shipborne or airborne maritime surveillance radars at scan mode work at a complex scene consisting of land, sea, and islands. Sea-land segmentation provides a two-class classification of sea clutter versus ground clutter to the surveillance scene as a precondition of adaptive target detection. It is a difficult problem because only a few coherent pulses are available at scan mode. Moreover, due to moving radar platforms and wide dynamic range of ground and sea clutter in power, average amplitude, Doppler offset, and initial phase of radar, the returns vector fails to distinguish sea clutter and ground clutter. In this article, a similarity measure of two radar returns vectors, which is invariant to amplitude, Doppler offset, and initial phase, is constructed, which is closely relevant to the Doppler bandwidth of a returns vector. Based on the similarity measure, a K-nearest neighbor classifier is proposed to yield a pixel-level sea-land segmentation of the scene. Further, the morphological filtering is operated on the pixel-level segmentation to obtain a region-level segmentation. Moreover, the discrete FrÃ©chet distances of the main boundaries in successive scan periods are used to assess segmentation quality. The proposed method is verified by measured data from an airborne radar and an island-based radar. The results show that it behaves better than the methods using thresholding phase linearity degree of radar returns and the support vector machine, and back propagation neural network in a three-dimensional feature space.","airborne radar,K-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier,region-level segmentation,K-nearest neighbor classifier,radar platforms,seaâ€“land segmentation,marine radar,island-based radar,K,Radar antennas,radar detection,complex scene,radar clutter,pixel-level sea-land segmentation,returns vector,ground clutter,pixel-level segmentation,scan mode work,sea clutter,geophysical image processing,support vector machines,similarity measure,object detection,feature extraction,search radar,radar imaging,Doppler effect,Radar clutter,Doppler,Doppler bandwidth,Doppler radar,Clutter,Discrete FrÃ©chet distance,surveillance scene,airborne maritime surveillance radars,radar returns vectors,morphological filter,Surveillance,image segmentation,remote sensing by radar,segmentation quality,oceanographic techniques,"
"a sensitivity quantification approach to significance analysis of thrusters in dynamic positioning operations","2021","The safety of offshore operations is highly dependent on the dynamic positioning (DP) capability of a vessel. Meanwhile, DP capability comes down to the ability of the thrust generated by thrusters to counteract environmental forces. Therefore, it is significant to investigate which thrusters are important to the position-keeping ability of vessels. However, complex environmental factors make the investigation of thrusters' importance more complicated. Hence, this paper proposes a new method to identify the influence of each thruster on vessel's station-keeping capability in different sea states. The station-keeping capability is quantified by a defined synthesized positioning ability criterion comprised by vessel position, heading angle, and consumed power. Through the comparison of different machine learning approaches, support vector machine (SVM) is used for building a surrogate model between DP capability and thrusters. In order to determine the most sensitive thruster in the whole process of vessel operation, an improved sensitivity analysis (SA) called ‘PAWN’ is employed along with statistical analysis to evaluate the significance of thrusters from different perspectives. Seventeen cases are investigated with respect to different thruster failures in various sea states. The results show the proposed method is able to identify the significance of each thruster in different scenarios.","Statistical analysis,Sensitivity analysis,Dynamic positioning capability,Thruster failures,"
"vessel detection in video with dynamic maritime background","2012","Automating the detection of non-cooperative vessels in surveillance video is challenging. First, the detection algorithm has to handle a large degree of appearance variation of vessels with respect to shape, size and viewing geometry. Second, a unique challenge in the maritime domain is the presence of sea clutter, which can cause a high number of false detections. While recent research in object detection has largely been focused on objects on the ground, we have developed a layered detection algorithm to address challenges in the maritime domain by fusing cues from (1) a discriminative detection algorithm that learns a vessel target model from hundreds of vessel images, and (2) a dynamic texture-based background model that adaptively learns the spatiotemporal dynamics of sea clutter. We present results on how each layer of the algorithms was individually optimized, and how their outputs were fused. Initial results were promising showing a significantly lower false alarm rate than when only the target model was applied.

"comparison of detectability of ship wake components between c-band and x-band synthetic aperture radar sensors operating under different slant ranges","2023","The detectability of wake components is affected by influencing parameters, which can be categorized into ship properties, environmental conditions and image acquisition settings. The characteristics of influences of most influencing parameters on the detectability are established. However, a consequent investigation and systematization of influences regarding differences in settings of various SARs have not been published. In this study, data from four different SARs missions, namely TerraSAR–X (TSX), CosmoSkymed (CSK), Sentinel–1 (S1) and RADARSAT–2 (RS2), were collected and analyzed with focus on detectability of ship wake components. The sensors operate on different orbit altitudes and radar frequency bands: TSX and CSK work with X–Band, S1 and RS2 work with C–Band. Using methods from the field of Data Science, the detectability of wake components is modelled for each of the four sensors using machine leaning by the support vector machine (SVM) method. The created SVM-models are then compared in order to derive statements regarding relative detectability of individual wake components. A measure of detectability model’s uncertainty and an alternative analysis based on accumulated backscattering statistics is presented to support the derived statements. In conclusion, sensors with shorter slant ranges and X–Band in comparison to C–Band were found to be better suited for the detection of ship wakes. However, these characteristics only hold for wake components detectable due to the Bragg scattering mechanism, i.e. Kelvin wake arms and V-narrow wakes. No significant difference for near and far field of turbulent wakes is recognized.","Ship wake detection,Synthetic aperture radar,Maritime object detection,Detectability modelling,Machine learning,"

In order to spot trends, detect anomalies, and interpret the temporal dynamics, it is essential to understand the connections among distinct brain regions, and how these connections evolve over time. However, the change points of dynamic reorganization in brain connectivity are unknown, which may occur frequently during the scanning session. In this paper, we introduce a fused lasso regression approach to detect the number and position of rapid connectivity changes of subject and subsequently estimate the brain effective connectivity networks within each state phase lying between consecutive change points by conditional Granger causality method from fMRI time series data. The performance of the method is verified via numerical simulations and the obtained classification accuracy with support vector machine (SVM) was 86.24% in 140 subjects from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Compared with static EC model and conventional dynamic EC model based on sliding window technique, the experimental results show that the fused lasso achieved better classification effect, which probably due to better dynamic description. The result shows that the dynamic effective connectivity based on change points detected by fused lasso method is a better feature for classification.","Alzheimer’s disease (AD),Dynamic brain connectivity,Granger causality analysis,Change points detection,Fused lasso regression,"

"structural health monitoring of harbor caissons using support vector machine and principal component analysis","2021","Harbor caissons are regarded as one of the most critical infrastructures, and any disruption in their operation would have dramatic economic consequences. The need for a health monitoring system for these structures is thus evident. The primary aim of this study is to develop a structural health monitoring (SHM) system to effectively detect damage in harbor caissons. To this end, through performing dynamic analysis, acceleration signals are extracted from the locations in the model corresponding to the presumed accelerometer's placement in an actual structure. Three levels of white Gaussian noises are added to the original signal to simulate the ambient noise. Using the acquired signals, the damage-sensitive features in both frequency and time domains are determined in the structure. In this study, leveraging Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Support Vector Machine (SVM), the damage-sensitive features associated with the damaged and undamaged structure are reduced in dimensionality and classified. Hence, the introduced system can assess the state of the structure based on the input signal from the accelerometer and detect possible damage and its severity. The effectiveness of the proposed system in detecting damage is shown using the numerical model of a real harbor caisson.","Support vector machine (SVM),Principal component analysis (PCA),Finite element (FE) modeling,Structural health monitoring,Autoregressive (AR) model,Machine learning,Harbor caissons,"
"monitoring recent changes of vegetation in fildes peninsula (king george island, antarctica) through satellite imagery guided by uav surveys","2020","Mapping accurately vegetation surfaces in space and time in the ice-free areas of Antarctica can provide important information to quantitatively describe the evolution of their ecosystems. Spaceborne remote sensing is the adequate way to map and evaluate multitemporal changes on the Antarctic vegetation at large but its nature of occurrence, in relatively small and sparse patches, makes the identification very challenging. The inclusion of an intermediate scale of observation between ground and satellite scales, provided by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) imagery, is of great help not only for their effective classification, but also for discriminating their main communities (lichens and mosses). Thus, this paper quantifies accurately recent changes of the vegetated areas in Fildes Peninsula (King George Island, Antarctica) through a novel methodology based on the integration of multiplatform data (satellite and UAV). It consists of multiscale imagery (spatial resolution of 2 m and 2 cm) from the same period to create a robust classifier that, after intensive calibration, is adequately used in other dates, where field reference data is scarce or not available at all. The methodology is developed and tested with UAV and satellite data from 2017 showing overall accuracies of 96% and kappa equal to 0.94 with a SVM classifier. These high performances allow the extrapolation to a pair of previous dates, 2006 and 2013, when atmospherically clear very high-resolution satellite imagery are available. The classification allows verifying a loss of the total area of vegetation of 4.5% during the 11-year time period under analysis, which corresponds to a 10.3% reduction for Usnea sp. and 9.8% for moss formations. Nevertheless, the breakdown analysis by time period shows a distinct behaviour for each vegetation type which are evaluated and discussed, namely for Usnea sp. whose decline is likely to be related to changing snow conditions.","Vegetation Mapping,Object-based classification,Change detection,Satellite,Permafrost,Antarctica,UAV,"
"classification of small boats in infrared images for maritime surveillance","2010","Autonomous round-the-clock observation of wide critical maritime areas can be a powerful support for border protection agencies to avoid criminal acts like illegal immigration, piracy or drug trafficking. These criminal acts are often accomplished by using small boats to decrease the probability of being uncovered. In this paper, we present an image exploitation approach to detect and classify maritime objects in infrared image sequences recorded from an autonomous platform. We focus on high robustness and generality with respect to variations of boat appearance, image quality, and environmental condition. A fusion of three different detection algorithms is performed to create reliable alarm hypotheses. In the following, a set of well-investigated features is extracted from the alarm hypotheses and evaluated using a two-stage-classification with support vector machines (SVMs) in order to distinguish between three object classes: clutter, irrelevant objects and suspicious boats. On the given image data we achieve a rate of 97% correct classifications.","infrared image sequences,suspicious boats,border protection,Support vector machines,radar clutter,illegal immigration,Feature extraction,drug trafficking,environmental condition,support vector machines,maritime surveillance,search radar,small boat classification,piracy,image quality,clutter,Histograms,Training,infrared imaging,image sequences,Boats,marine communication,Clutter,"
"detection of invalid ais messages using machine learning techniques","2022","Coastal nations monitor maritime activities in the interest of defence, security, and safety. This form of monitoring typically occurs at operations centers that visualize the maritime environment by creating a Recognized Maritime Picture (RMP) covering a particular area of interest. The creation of this picture changed drastically with the introduction of the Automatic Identification System (AIS). AIS messages are known to contain numerous types of errors and in April 2020 a unique error was found in the data stream. This error consisted of messages indicating the appearance of over 200 vessels in the North Atlantic taking part in a yacht race when in fact no race or physical ships existed. The following work explores the application of various machine learning (ML) techniques to help identify these types of fabricated AIS messages. Specific ML techniques were explored including: K-means clustering, Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Feed-Forward Neural Networks (FNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and One-Class Support Vector Machines (One-SVM). The results showed that DT, RF, and FNN best identified the fabricated AIS messages with F1 scores greater than 93 percent on the test data.","maritime domain awareness,AIS,automatic identification system,machine learning,"

"segmentation and classification of man-made maritime objects in terrasar-x images","2011","Spaceborne monitoring of wide maritime areas can be suit able for many applications such as tracking of ship traffic, surveillance of fishery zones, or detecting criminal activities. We present novel approaches for segmentation and classification of man-made objects in TerraSAR-X images including estimation of orientation and size. This is a difficult task as detections are affected by clutter and noise effects, and each object can have different appearances. We chose a statistical approach to robustly segment given detections using Local Binary Pattern (LBP) and Histograms of Oriented Gradients (HOG). This is the fundament for subsequent feature analysis and 3-stage-classification based on Support Vector Machines (SVM) with separation of clutter and man-made objects in first, non-ships and ships in second, and different ship structure types in third stage. An experimental evaluation demonstrates the effective operation of our approaches.","surveillance,histograms of oriented gradients,noise effect,local binary pattern,Support vector machines,feature analysis,spaceborne monitoring,Marine vehicles,geophysical techniques,Principal component analysis,geophysical image processing,TerraSAR-X images,criminal activities,ships,support vector machines,Noise,clutter effect,object detection,image classification,maritime areas,man-made maritime objects,Object segmentation,3-stage-classification,fishery zones,Clutter,ship structure,ship traffic,image segmentation,Estimation,aquaculture,"
"a wavelet-based deep learning pipeline for efficient covid-19 diagnosis via ct slices","2022","The quick diagnosis of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) disease is vital to prevent its propagation and improve therapeutic outcomes. Computed tomography (CT) is believed to be an effective tool for diagnosing COVID-19, however, the CT scan contains hundreds of slices that are complex to be analyzed and could cause delays in diagnosis. Artificial intelligence (AI) especially deep learning (DL), could facilitate and speed up COVID-19 diagnosis from such scans. Several studies employed DL approaches based on 2D CT images from a single view, nevertheless, 3D multiview CT slices demonstrated an excellent ability to enhance the efficiency of COVID-19 diagnosis. The majority of DL-based studies utilized the spatial information of the original CT images to train their models, though, using spectral–temporal information could improve the detection of COVID-19. This article proposes a DL-based pipeline called CoviWavNet for the automatic diagnosis of COVID-19. CoviWavNet uses a 3D multiview dataset called OMNIAHCOV. Initially, it analyzes the CT slices using multilevel discrete wavelet decomposition (DWT) and then uses the heatmaps of the approximation levels to train three ResNet CNN models. These ResNets use the spectral–temporal information of such images to perform classification. Subsequently, it investigates whether the combination of spatial information with spectral–temporal information could improve the diagnostic accuracy of COVID-19. For this purpose, it extracts deep spectral–temporal features from such ResNets using transfer learning and integrates them with deep spatial features extracted from the same ResNets trained with the original CT slices. Then, it utilizes a feature selection step to reduce the dimension of such integrated features and use them as inputs to three support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. To further validate the performance of CoviWavNet, a publicly available benchmark dataset called SARS-COV-2-CT-Scan is employed. The results of CoviWavNet have demonstrated that using the spectral–temporal information of the DWT heatmap images to train the ResNets is superior to utilizing the spatial information of the original CT images. Furthermore, integrating deep spectral–temporal features with deep spatial features has enhanced the classification accuracy of the three SVM classifiers reaching a final accuracy of 99.33% and 99.7% for the OMNIAHCOV and SARS-COV-2-CT-Scan datasets respectively. These accuracies verify the outstanding performance of CoviWavNet compared to other related studies. Thus, CoviWavNet can help radiologists in the rapid and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 diagnosis.","Convolutional neural networks,Discrete wavelet transform (DWT),Deep learning,Computed tomography (CT),COVID-19,ResNet,"
"a novel network security algorithm based on improved support vector machine from smart city perspective","2018","Computer generated security concerns have become more modern and complex. Intrusion detection(ID) is a practical issue in the field of computer security whose primary objective is to detect rare attack or assaults and to ensure the security of interior systems. This paper also proposes a semi-class intrusion detection method that combines multiple classifiers to arrange exceptions and typical exercises in a computer system. The abuse detection model is constructed in the light of the decision tree learning-iterative dichotomise 3(DTL-ID3) and is assembled by utilizing the gathered data based on anomaly detection model executed by one class-support vector machine(OC-SVM). In recent years, people have paid more attention to ID/intrusion prevention system (IDS / IPS), which is closely related to the protection and utilization of system management. A few machine-learning standards including neural system, direct hereditary programming, and advanced support vector machines(ASVMs), Bayesian system, multivariate versatile relapse splines, fluffy derivation systems(FIS) and other analogical systems have been researched for the outline of intrusion detection system. In this paper, we build up an amalgam method based on DTL-ID3 and OC-SVM(A-DT and SVM) and evaluate the performance of the projected methodology by using a specific dataset and a crossover method in order to enhance the accuracy of IDS/IPS when contrasted with a singular support vector machine.","Intrusion detection system/intrusion prevention system,Data mining,One class-support vector machine,Decision tree learning-iterative dichotomise 3,"
"red tide detection based on high spatial resolution broad band optical satellite data","2022","Red tide, one of the major ecological disasters in the world, exerts great impact on the marine environment. The ocean color satellite data with low spatial resolution and high spectral resolution is often used for red tide detection, but is insufficient for the fine-scale red tide detection due to its coarse spatial resolution. To address this problem, a new red tide detection method based on pseudo hue angle (PHA-RI) for high spatial resolution broad band satellite data is proposed in this paper. Different from the standard International Commission on Illumination (CIE) system, the false-color bands of near infrared (NIR), red and green are used to calculate the CIE tristimulus X, Y, Z, instead of the true-color bands of red, green and blue. With this method, the red tide can be easily differentiated from non-red tide water, and the distinction between red tide and non-red tide water is doubled compared to that of true-color bands composite. Experiment results show that the PHA-RI method can effectively detect red tide, with an averaged overall accuracy, F1-score and precision of 92%, 0.92 and 0.92 respectively. Compared with the traditional machine learning method support vector machine (SVM) and spectral index algorithm Gaofen-1 (GF-1) red tide detection index (GF-RI), the proposed algorithm has obvious advantages in red tide detection, especially for the strip distributed red tide. Besides, the proposed algorithm has good applicability, and it is proved to be suitable for the detection of red tides with different dominant species including Noctiluca scintillans, Skeletonema costatum and Heterosigma akashiide. Also, it is applicable to different broad band sensors, such as Chinese satellites GF-1 Wide Field of View (WFV), Haiyang 1D (HY-1D) Coastal Zone Imager (CZI), Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI). The application experiment indicates that the proposed algorithm is effective in red tide detection, and it can successfully detect fine-scale red tide events, which have not been detected by Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Aqua due to its coarse spatial resolution. The results also shows the advantages of high spatial resolution satellites in fine-scale red tide detection. This work provides a method for red tide detection using high spatial resolution broad band satellite data.","Pseudo hue angle,Detection method,Red tide,Remote sensing,Broad band sensor,"
